    "a statistical analysis by alcock _ et al . _ ( 1996 ) of the 2-year microlensing data ( 6 or 8 events ) obtained by the macho project in the direction of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) indicated that the massive dark halo objects ( mhos or ` machos ' ) responsible for the microlensing events could account for 30 - 100% of the total mass in the halo of our galaxy . according to their analysis , typical",
    "( average ) mass of the mhos should lie in the range @xmath10 .",
    "the more recent 4-year data ( 14 events , axelrod 1997 ) yield similar ranges of the inferred quantities .",
    "apart from the statistical error due to the relatively small number of events , our ignorance regarding the structure of the halo of massive objects ( i.e. , their spatial distribution and kinematics ) leads to rather large uncertainties in the inferred masses .",
    "this last source of error is not likely to be extinguished if one relies only on the measurement of event durations @xmath11",
    "( @xmath12 is the einstein radius , @xmath13 is the mho s velocity orthogonal to the line of sight ) . indeed , as shown by markovic & sommer - larsen ( 1997 , paper i ) , for the number of events @xmath14 the halo structure can not be constrained sufficiently to allow a determination of the average mass @xmath15 of the mhos to better than a factor of about 2 .",
    "furthermore , paper i discussed only a limited class of spherical haloes ; the results of evans ( 1997 ) , based on a far wider variety of halo models , imply that the range of @xmath2 ( at virtually arbitrary @xmath16 ) could in principle extend from 0.1 to 1 .",
    "the duration @xmath17 is , however , not the only relevant quantity that can be obtained from a microlensing event .",
    "for instance , photometric ( gould 1994a ; nemiroff & wickramasinghe 1994 ) or spectroscopic (",
    "maoz & gould 1994 ) methods have been proposed to measure the proper motion of the lens @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the earth - source distance , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the earth - lense distance .",
    "another approach [ discussed by grieger , kayser & refsdal ( 1986 ) in the context of quasar astronomy ] is parallax microlensing , i.e. , observing magnification through telescopes displaced from each other by about 1au .",
    "more recently , gould ( 1994b ) studied and advocated the use of parallax microlensing to obtain more information regarding the position and velocities of the lenses ( and consequently reduce the uncertainty of their masses ) .",
    "the utility of the parallaxes stems primarily from the fact that the delay @xmath22 between the maximal magnifications in the two detectors ( one on the earth and the other on a satellite in a heliocentric orbit ) does not depend on the mass of the mho crossing the two lines of sight to a source additional information is contained in the two maximal magnifications determined by the impact parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 measured in units of the einstein radius . breaking a 4-fold degeneracy ( gould 1994b ; see also section 2 of the present paper ) by observing from a second satellite would allow us to obtain the so - called reduced transverse velocity @xmath25 of the mho .",
    "a sufficiently large number of such measurements would then presumably put tight constraints on the structure of the halo . however , even in absence of a second satellite , the relative motion of the first satellite and the earth could suffice to reduce the ambiguity to ( at most ) a 2-fold degeneracy in the direction of @xmath26 for a majority of events ( gould 1995 ; boutreux & gould 1996 ) . [ according to han & gould ( 1995 ) this should ( in the case of galactic bulge microlensing ) permit measurement of _ individual _ mho masses to an accuracy of about 0.2 on the logarithmic scale . ]    in this paper we explore quantitatively the extent to which one could expect parallax microlensing to help constrain the mass function of the mhos as well as their spatial distribution and kinematics .",
    "the assumptions of the present paper are similar to those of paper i : for convenience we again limit ourselves to a class of spherical halo models ( see section 3 ) described by a set of 5 parameters ( the singular isothermal sphere is a particularly simple member of this class ) . on the other hand , the mass function is assumed to be a simple power law , @xmath27 characterised by three parameters ( independent of the position in the halo ) : the average mass @xmath28 , slope @xmath3 and range @xmath29 on the logarithmic scale .",
    "although lacking somewhat in generality , this framework will allow a straightforward application of the apparatus of statistical parameter estimation : the errors of maximum likelihood inference of the mass function and halo parameters can be estimated from the sensitivity of the distributions of directly measurable quantities to small shifts in the underlying parameters ( see paper i and section 5 of the present paper ) .",
    "we call such estimates the cramer errors @xcite . for simplicity we will study both the _ degenerate _ ( with the full 4-fold degeneracy ) parallax microlensing , where the observable quantities are @xmath17 , @xmath30 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 and _",
    "resolved _ ( the 4-fold degeneracy completely removed ) parallax microlensing with observables @xmath17 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the transversal distance between the two lines of sight in the lens plane measured in einstein radii .    in specific computations we at first adopt for the parameters of the underlying halo model the values corresponding to the centrally condensed ( @xmath34 ; @xmath35 ; @xmath36 is the distance from the centre of the galaxy ) halo of blue horizontal branch field stars ( bhbfs ; see section 3 ) .",
    "although one might speculate as to the relevance  or irrelevance  of this structure to the halo of mhos ( paper i ) , these values are simply taken as a convenient starting point for our numerical experiment and the accuracy of their inference is estimated .",
    "in addition we briefly discuss the inference starting from the singular isothermal sphere ( @xmath37 ; constant , isotropic velocity dispersion ) as a model for the mho halo .",
    "we find that parallax microlensing reduces the cramer errors in @xmath2 from a factor of 2 - 10 , characteristic of measurements of event durations , to only 15 - 20% ( at @xmath1 events ) for _ a priori _ unknown halo structure parameters .",
    "this error is typical of inference under the ( unrealistic ) assumption that the halo model _ is _ accurately known _ a priori _ and is kept fixed in the maximum - likelihood fitting of the distribution of measurable quantities .",
    "the improvement indeed results from an effective disentanglement of the mass function from the halo structure .",
    "in addition , while parallax - based errors in parameters @xmath3 and @xmath29 , specifying the shape of the mass function , are comparable to duration - based errors if @xmath3 is sufficiently close to -1.5 , the growth of the errors away from this value is strongly restrained by the parallaxes ( see fig .",
    "parallax microlensing also reduces by about two orders of magnitude the cramer errors for the halo parameters .",
    "the power index @xmath7 of the halo density profile is determined with the error @xmath38 ( at both @xmath34 and @xmath37 ) , again from @xmath1 events .",
    "on the other hand , the errors in the parameters specifying the velocity dispersion profile are of roughly the same magnitude as the parameters themselves .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily mean that the profile will be poorly determined : as shown in section 5 , virtually all uncertainty ( at @xmath34 ) is due to the existence of a _ single _ linear combination of velocity dispersion parameters that is poorly constrained even by parallax microlensing .",
    "indeed , small displacements in the parameter space along this vector cause a particularly weak change in the velocity profile . in addition , these changes tend to occur predominantly at large radii , where the microlensing rate is low .",
    "the peculiarities of the singular isothermal sphere , on the other hand , lead to the existence of _ three _ poorly constrained linear combinations of velocity dispersion parameters , none of them having a significant effect on the flat velocity profile .",
    "remarkably , all the above conclusions are virtually independent of whether we use the degenerate or fully resolved parallaxes : the improvement due to resolving the degeneracy is modest .    in section 2 of this paper",
    "we derive expressions for distribution functions of measurable quantities .",
    "these expressions are general and can be used with arbitrary halo models .",
    "the specific class of halo models used in this paper is described in section 3 ( following a similar section in paper i ) .",
    "section 4 deals with the morphology of the distribution functions derived in section 2 , while section 5 explores their sensitivity to the underlying parameters and thus derives the cramer errors of inference .",
    "finally , section 6 contains basic conclusions of this paper along with a bit of speculation regarding their more general validity .",
    "as observed from the earth , a lens of mass @xmath39 , crossing the earth - source line of sight at distance @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) from the earth and with the impact parameter @xmath42 [ @xmath43 , @xmath44 km ] will magnify the star by the maximum factor @xmath45 . on the other hand , a satellite will detect maximum magnification , determined by the impact parameter @xmath46 relative to the satellite - source line of sight , with the time shift @xmath22 from the moment of the earth - observed maximum magnification .",
    "[ pwgeom ]    the geometric relations between the observable quantities , @xmath47 ( event duration as observed by both the earth - based observer and the satellite ) , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are easily derived from fig .  1 .",
    "if @xmath48 is the component of the earth - satellite vector orthogonal to the line of sight , its source - centered projection onto the plane ( also orthogonal to the line of sight ) of the lens is @xmath49 ( measured in units of the einstein radius @xmath12 ) .",
    "the points ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' in fig .  1 denote intersections of the earth - source and satellite - source lines of sight respectively with the lens plane . the lens trajectory along the unit vector @xmath50 ( again , projected on the lens plane ) , shown as the solid arrow , crosses the 1 - 2 line at distance @xmath51 from the parallel line ( dotted ) drawn through the midpoint between 1 and 2 .",
    "consequently , @xmath52 is an observable quantity . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath53 generally can not be obtained unambiguously from @xmath23 and @xmath24 only ; the 4-fold degeneracy is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pwdeg ] . a secure way of breaking this degeneracy would be to use a second satellite [ the line tangent to three circles of radii @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath54 ( the last measured from the second satellite ) is unique ] .",
    "however , as gould ( 1995 ) has shown , the motion of the earth and the single satellite relative to the line of sight should allow us to resolve the ambiguity  at least regarding the magnitude of @xmath55  in most cases .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper we will discuss both the ` _ degenerate _ ' ( the 4-fold ambiguity unresolved ) and the ` _ resolved _ ' ( @xmath55 uniquely determined ) parallax microlensing .",
    "the lens rate of crossing near the line of sight per single source and a single ( number density near the sun @xmath56 ) lens is @xmath57 where @xmath58 [ @xmath59 is the mhos halo density profile along the line of sight , @xmath60 [ @xmath61 is the @xmath62-dependent , 2-dimensional distribution of velocities projected orthogonal to the line of sight and @xmath63 [ @xmath64 is the @xmath62-independent mass function of the mhos .",

    "so far in this section we have ignored the question of the minimum amplification necessary for successful detection of a microlensing event . in particular , microlensing might produce sufficient magnification only in the earth- ( or satellite- ) based detector , i.e. , the magnification in the other detector ( say ` 2 ' ) could be too small for a reliable determination of @xmath22 and @xmath24 . to deal with this possibility",

    "this again is manifested in errors of the same ( small ) order near @xmath224 in all four cases shown in fig .",
    ". however , away from @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 grow large for event duration - based inference . here again , the parallaxes restrain this growth significantly ( especially for @xmath225 ) and keep the errors down in the range characteristic of the fixed - halo inference .",
    "interestingly , degenerate parallax errors @xmath222 @xmath225 and @xmath226 are only a few percent smaller than the resolved parallax values ( and we omit the corresponding plots ) .",
    "as suggested above , the significant improvement in the accuracy of the mass function determination should be ascribed to the disentanglement of the halo structure from the mho masses .",
    "this disentanglement is obvious from the plots in fig .",
    "11 of the correlation matrix @xmath227 the off - diagonal spikes ` coupling ' the halo with the mass function are noticeably less pronounced in the parallax case ( right ) .",
    "[ notice , e.g. , the strong correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath7 in the duration based inference ( left ) and its significant drop in the parallax case ( right ) . ]    [ errors.halo ]    further comparison of the two plots of fig .",
    "11 also shows a significant reduction in the correlation among some of the halo parameters due to the parallax measurements .",
    "does this imply that the halo structure itself could be inferable ?",
    "figure  12 indeed displays a remarkable suppression of the cramer errors of the halo parameters inference : the ( resolved ) parallax errors at least are of the same order of magnitude as the parameters themselves or smaller . and",
    "approach the cramer limit from _",
    "below_. ] in particular , the density profile index @xmath7 can be determined rather accurately .",
    "[ the difference between the degenerate and resolved parallax errors is more pronounced for the halo model parameters than for the mass function ; still , the degenerate parallax errors are larger than the resolved parallax ones by at most 20% .",
    "the measurement of @xmath31 and the information contained in @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath147 are thus sufficient to constrain the halo even if the determination of @xmath55 is subject to the 4-fold ambiguity . ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the use of parallax microlensing for the class of models discussed in this paper indeed brings a great advantage : it allows an effective disentanglement of the mass function of the mhos and the structure of the halo .",
    "there indeed seems to be a way to go beyond the somewhat pessimistic conclusions of paper i and infer accurately the average mass of the mhos ( together with the shape of the mass function ) after detecting a realistic number , @xmath228 , of events . in addition , one can constrain the halo structure much more tightly than it is possible through measurement of event durations only . moreover",
    ", some combinations of parameters describing the halo structure can be inferred rather accurately . virtually all the uncertainty regarding the halo model",
    "is then localised in a few ( precisely _ one _ in the cs - based example discussed in section 5 ) ` eigen - modes ' of the halo , i.e. , those displacements in the halo parameter space that are left ` loose ' by parallax microlensing while allowing other displacements to be independently ( and tightly ) constrained .",
    "these poorly constrained modes correspond to particularly small changes in the _ actual _ structure of the halo as given by density and velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "unfortunately , their large associated eigen - errors may push us into a non - linear regime ( inadequately charted by the cramer limit ) of deviations in the halo structure that can be properly explored only by time - consuming monte - carlo simulations .",
    "although obtained on the basis of a limited class of halo models , the above conclusions should be relevant in a broader context .",
    "the halo structure / mass function disentanglement ( and consequently accurate mass determination ) as well as the inference of some properties of the halo structure itself should result from the significant enhancement of information ( as elaborated in section 5 ) due to parallax microlensing even if one allows for a much wider range of halo structures .",
    "for instance , in the more general case of non - spherical haloes , one may hope to constrain the density and velocity dispersions _ along the line of sight _ well enough to determine the mass function .",
    "the ` uncertain ' modes would then describe possibly large changes in the halo structure away from the line of sight .",
    "only parallax microlensing observations in several directions would presumably suffice to infer the overall structure of the halo .",
    "these conjectures need to be tested on other , more realistic or better dynamically founded models ( e.g. , those of evans 1994 ) of the halo than the ones discussed in the present paper .",
