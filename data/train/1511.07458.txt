    "the idea that lepton masses are induced in one loop has been around for a long time .",

    "@xcite for generating charged - lepton masses .",
    "this model assumes the non - abelian discrete symmetry @xmath2 under which the three families of leptons transform as @xmath3 with only the one higgs doublet @xmath4 of the standard model ( sm ) transforming as @xmath5 , a tree - level lepton mass is forbidden . to obtain one - loop radiative lepton masses ,",
    "the following new particles are added , all of which are odd under an unbroken dark @xmath6 symmetry : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are fermions and @xmath9 are charged scalars . note that in supersymmetry , there are also similar new particles , i.e. left and right charged sleptons and doublet higgsinos . the soft breaking of @xmath2 to @xmath10 lepton triality  @xcite is encoded in the scalar off - diagonal mass - squared @xmath11 terms . in this paper",
    "we will study the phenomenological consequences of this proposal , including the deviation of the higgs to charged - lepton decay from the sm , the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , as well as the structure of its dark sector .",
    "the mass matrix linking @xmath12 to @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 are invariant mass terms , and @xmath16 come from the higgs yukawa terms @xmath17 , @xmath18 with vacuum expectation value @xmath19 . as a result , @xmath20 and @xmath21 mix to form two dirac fermion eigenstates @xmath22 of masses @xmath23 , with mixing angles @xmath24 with the @xmath2 assignment of eq .",

    "it is clear that the residual @xmath10 triality  @xcite remains exact with @xmath41 , and the higgs coupling matrix as well as the anomalous magnetic moment matrix are diagonal , as far as fig .",

    "flavor is not violated in higgs decays and @xmath0 is not mediated by the new particles of eq .",
    "one immediate consequence of a radiative charged - lepton mass is that the higgs yukawa coupling @xmath42 is no longer exactly @xmath43 as in the sm .",
    "its deviation is not suppressed by the usual one - loop factor of @xmath44 and may be large enough to be observable  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this deviation is finite and calculable exactly in one loop . for discussion , compare our proposal to the usual consideration of the deviation of the higgs coupling from @xmath43 from new physics in terms of higher - dimensional operators , i.e. @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
