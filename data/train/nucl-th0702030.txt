    "the analysis of the data collected recently at rhic suggests that matter created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions behaves like a perfect fluid @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis inspires new interests in the studies of relativistic hydrodynamics of perfect and viscous fluids @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the effects of the temperature dependence of the sound velocity on the hydrodynamic evolution of matter created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we use the approach to the relativistic hydrodynamics of perfect fluid where the sound velocity is the only thermodynamic parameter entering the formalism @xcite . in this way ,",
    "we are able to observe and analyze the immediate consequences of a particular choice of the function @xmath0 on the space - time evolution of matter .    our study may be regarded as complementary to ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effects of a particular choice of the equation of state on the particle spectra and elliptic flow were studied .",
    "our approach differs from ref .",
    "@xcite by the selection of the equations of state under investigations . in our case",
    "the equations of state are always constrained by the lattice results in the high temperature limit and differ from each other mainly in the neighborhood of the critical temperature . on the other hand , the main differences between the equations of state studied in ref .",
    "@xcite appear in the region above the critical temperature .    in our approach",
    "the full information about the equation of state is contained in the temperature dependent sound velocity . at high temperatures , @xmath6",
    ", we use the sound velocity function obtained from the recent lattice simulations of qcd @xcite , whereas at low temperatures , @xmath7 , we use the result of the ideal hadron gas model @xcite . at moderate temperatures different interpolations between those two results",
    "are employed .",
    "the interpolating functions have a local maximum at @xmath8 ( corresponding to the maximal value of the sound velocity in the hadron gas ) and a local minimum at @xmath3 ( corresponding to the expected minimal value of the sound velocity at the phase transition ) .",
    "the values of the sound velocity at the maximum and minimum are chosen in such a way that in the limit of very high temperatures all considered sound - velocity functions yield the entropy density consistent with the lattice simulations of qcd .",
    "we emphasize that in all the considered cases we take into account only smoothly varying functions @xmath0 , hence we deal with the cross - over phase transitions rather than with the rigorous phase transitions of a given order that might be determined by the discontinuity of the appropriate thermodynamic variable .",
    "nevertheless , the deeper is the minimum of the sound velocity at the critical temperature , the more the system evolution resembles the behavior typical for the exact first order phase transition .",
    "the main difference between the first order phase transition studied commonly in the literature and the _ approximate _ first - order phase transition studied below ( as one of the examples ) is that in our case the phase transition does not lead to the ideal quark - gluon plasma but rather to strongly interacting plasma characterized by the lattice results .",

    "is slightly increased compared to that considered in the case i. the larger values of the sound velocity in this region may be attributed to the repulsive van der waals effects .",
    ", scaledwidth=46.5% ]    in spite of such differences , in agreement with earlier studies @xcite we find that a deep minimum of the sound velocity leads to the very long , exceeding 20 fm ( @xmath12 ) , evolution time of the system .",
    "we further find that even moderate minima lead to quite long evolution times of the system , which exceed 15 fm .",
    "clearly , such long evolution times are not compatible with the recent hbt estimates of the lifetime of the system .",
    "for example , one finds times of about 10 fm using the rhic data in the relation @xmath13 @xcite , which connects the longitudinal pion correlation radius @xmath14 , the kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath15 , the evolution time @xmath16 , and the transverse mass of the pion pair @xmath17 .",
    "another example is ref .",
    "@xcite that obtained only 6 fm for the effective duration of the hydrodynamic evolution in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "only if the sound velocity has a shallow minimum resulting from the simplest interpolation between the ideal hadron gas result at @xmath18 and the lattice result at @xmath19 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cs2hgqcd ] , one finds that the evolution time of the system might be compatible with the hbt result .",
    "we thus conclude that the hydrodynamic description becomes adequate if the qcd cross - over phase transition renders the smooth temperature variations of the sound velocity , with a possible shallow minimum at @xmath1 where the values of @xmath5 remain well above 0.1 .",
    "in fig . [ fig : cs2hgqcd ] we show the function @xmath5 obtained from the ideal hadron gas calculation @xcite and the lattice simulations of qcd @xcite . the ideal hadron gas result ( dashed line )",
    "was obtained with the full mass spectrum of resonances @xcite .",
    "one can check that at very small temperatures the sound velocity is determined basically by the properties of the massive pion gas ; for @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the pion mass , one finds @xmath22 . clearly , this behavior is quite different from the limiting value @xmath23 characterizing the massless pion gas .",
    "the lattice calculations ( solid line ) were obtained for physical masses of the light quarks and the strange quark @xcite .",
    "one can see that the results of the two calculations cross around the critical temperature , we assume @xmath1 = 170 mev , and may be naturally interpolated ( see a thick solid line in this region ) .",
    "taking the lattice result at the face value , one expects that the sound velocity significantly drops down in the region @xmath24 . similar behavior , with @xmath25 reaching zero , is expected in the case of the first order first transition where the changes of the energy happen at constant pressure .",
    "however , the lattice simulations suggest that for three massive quarks with realistic masses we deal with the cross - over rather than with the first order phase transition , hence the sound velocity remains finite , as is consistently shown in fig . [ fig : cs2hgqcd ] .",
    "nevertheless , the exact values of the sound velocity in the region @xmath24 are in our opinion poorly known , since the lattice calculations are not very much reliable for @xmath26 and , at the same time , the use of the hadron gas model with vacuum parameters becomes unrealistic for large densities ( temperatures ) .",
    "in this situation , it is practical to consider different interpolations between the lattice and hadron - gas results and to analyze the physical effects of a particular choice of the interpolating function .    in this paper",
    "we consider three different sound - velocity functions @xmath0 .",
    "below , we refer to these three options as to the cases i , ii and iii , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cs2deep ] . in the case",
    "i , we use the sound - velocity function which agrees with the ideal hadron gas model of ref .",
    "@xcite in the temperature range @xmath27 and with the lattice result in the temperature range @xmath6 . in the region close to the critical temperature",
    ", @xmath28 , a simple interpolation between the two results is used .",
    "we have checked that such a simple interpolation yields directly the entropy density consistent with the lattice result .",
    "namely , the use of the thermodynamic relation @xmath29 , \\label{sumrule}\\ ] ] relating the entropy density with the sound velocity for zero baryon chemical potential , gives the function @xmath30 which agrees with the lattice result at high temperatures , @xmath31 at @xmath32 @xcite .    in the cases ii and iii , the sound - velocity interpolating functions have a distinct minimum at . comparing to the case i [ with and ]",
    ", the value of the sound velocity at is reduced by in the case ii [ where and ] , and by 50% in the case iii [ where and ] . from eq .",
    "( [ sumrule ] ) one concludes that the relative decrease of the sound velocity at @xmath1 leads to the relative increase of entropy density for high temperatures .",
    "hence , in order to have the same value of the entropy density at high temperatures , a decrease of the sound velocity function in the region @xmath33 should be compensated by its increase in a different temperature range . for our interpolating functions in the cases ii and iii we assume that the values of @xmath0 in the range @xmath34 are slightly higher than in the case i , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cs2deep ] . such modifications may be regarded as the parameterization of the repulsive van der waals forces in the hadron gas .",
    "the values of the maxima are chosen in such a way that the entropy densities for three considered cases are consistent with the lattice result , see the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : huo ] where the functions @xmath35 are shown .",
    "we stress that in the three considered cases the values of @xmath0 in the temperature range @xmath36 remain significantly below the massless limit @xmath37 .",
    "such a limiting value is implicitly used in many hydrodynamic codes assuming the equation of state of non - interacting massless quarks and gluons for @xmath38 , see for example the extended 3 + 1 hydrodynamic model of ref .",
    "we expect that the cooling of the central part of our system will be significantly slower than the cooling of the systems containing an ideal quark - gluon plasma in the core and this effect reflects the non - perturbative phenomena taking place above @xmath1 that may be attributed to the formation of strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma .",
    "we also note that our study differs from the 3 + 1 model of ref .",
    "@xcite where the interpolation between the equation of state of the ideal quark - gluon plasma above @xmath1 ( not of the lattice qcd ) and the resonance gas below @xmath1 was introduced .",
    "we have checked that the corrections introduced in this way differ from the non - perturbative effects found in the lattice simulations .",
    "moreover , fig . 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( lower left panel ) indicates that the sound velocity at low temperatures does not drop to zero as in our case .",
    "in this section we recapitulate the main features of approach to the relativistic hydrodynamics , which is the generalization of the method introduced by baym et al .",
    "@xcite and has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( introduction of the temperature dependent sound velocity and initial transverse flow ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ( inclusion of the cylindrical asymmetry ) .",
    "we rewrite the equations in such a way that the sound velocity is the only thermodynamic parameter characterizing the matter . such reformulation of the hydrodynamic equations is always possible in the case of zero net baryon density . since we consider the evolution of matter formed in the central region at the largest rhic energies , the approximation of zero net baryon density is reasonable .",
    "thermal analysis of the ratios of hadron multiplicities indicates that the baryon chemical potential at rhic top energies is about 30 mev , i.e. , it is much smaller than the corresponding temperature of about 170 mev @xcite .",
    "we also restrict our considerations to the boost - invariant and cylindrically symmetric expansion .",
    "the assumption of boost - invariance is again good for the central region , while the effects of azimuthal asymmetry are typically small , of the order of 10% , and have no effects on our conclusions .    in the case of vanishing baryon chemical potential the hydrodynamic equations",
    "may be written in the following form @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the temperature , @xmath42 is the entropy density , and @xmath43 is the hydrodynamic four - velocity ( with @xmath44 ) . since temperature is the only independent thermodynamic variable , all other thermodynamic quantities can be obtained from pressure given as a function of temperature , @xmath45 .",
    "such a function plays a role of the equation of state . with the help of the thermodynamic relations @xmath46 other thermodynamic quantities",

    "interestingly , the case iii describes how our approach with the temperature dependent sound velocity is capable of imitating the phenomena present at the real phase transitions .",

    "in view of the rhic data indicating a short lifetime of the system we may analyze the problem of the lifetime in the reverse order , asking the question how soft the equation of the state may be to allow for a hydrodynamic description consistent with the hbt results . in our approach the issue of the softest point is translated into the problem of realistic behavior of the sound velocity in the vicinity of the critical temperature .",
    "we argue that the smooth behavior of the sound velocity without any distinct minimum is favored if we demand the short hydrodynamic evolution time of about 10 fm .",
    "our calculations show , as expected , that the hydrodynamic evolution is very sensitive to the actual values of the sound velocity and indicates how extremely important is the good knowledge of the function @xmath0 .",
    "the reliable values of @xmath89 are not only required for the vicinity of the phase transition but also for smaller and larger temperatures , since the sound velocity plays a role of the coupling between the temperature gradients and the acceleration of the fluid .",
    "finally , we note that the cooling of the system may be faster if the initial pre - equilibrium transverse flow is formed .",
    "the inclusion of such a flow in the initial conditions for the hydrodynamic equations leads naturally to faster expansion of matter ."
