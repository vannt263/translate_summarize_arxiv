    "approximating the correlated ground state of a many - body quantum system has been receiving considerable attention since the early days of nuclear structure physics @xcite and degenerate electron gas theory @xcite and still represents a formidable challenge .",
    "this is an arduous task within the `` beyond the mean - field '' theories because of the action of the residual interaction which brings particle - hole admixtures into the ground states . in the present paper we focus on the effects of long - range part of this interaction .",
    "unambiguously attributable to the latter is the quadrupole correlation energy , which , as shown by the findings in ref.@xcite , is considerable and varies between 100 kev and 5.5 mev in different nuclei which makes the perturbative treatment unsuitable .",
    "the short - range residual forces , on the other hand , compete with the long - range ones in dominating the ground - state shapes formation @xcite . as a result of this competition , in the beginning and the end of major shells the nucleons are paired , giving rise to spherical shape , while in the middle of the shell the nucleons are paired - off and they align to the field generating forces thus contributing to deformation .",
    "we conjecture that the present study can serve as a foundation to investigate the mechanism of the transition between these two regimes and in particular on the pairs decoupling process . the process that we surmise was concocted in ref .",
    "@xcite and essentially implies that the long - range force breaks nucleon pairs which may further recouple due to the pairing force .",
    "we approximate the nuclear ground - state wave function with the phonon operators @xcite vacuum state .",
    "a general form of the phonon vacuum was proposed by sorensen @xcite and later goswami and pal @xcite estimated explicitly the correlation coefficients of the @xmath0 admixtures into the bcs wave function @xcite relating them to the forward and backward phonon amplitudes .",
    "the relation they obtained turned out to be also valid for higher order correlations @xcite in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "being a small amplitude limit of the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation , however , rpa is known to be able to account only for small correlation effects . since in open - shell nuclei",
    "the backward phonon amplitudes are by no means small , rpa is becoming questionable in describing the low - energy states of such nuclei . on a quest to construct a microscopic global theory for the nuclear binding energies it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the rpa is a useful method around spherical and well deformed nuclei but falls short in describing nuclei from the transitional region",
    ". this problem was addressed by hara @xcite and later on by jolos and rybarska @xcite , who proposed an improvement over the rpa , referred to as extended rpa(erpa ) , based on the pauli blocking principle which plays a progressively important role with the increasing number of the valence nucleons .",
    "this extension has proven to be in better accord with the experimental data as demonstrated in a number of papers as for example in refs.@xcite .",
    "although its superiority over the standard rpa is undeniable , the variational character of the theory is violated as the ground state is found to be overbound . the strong argument that the variational property of a theory insures a converging succession of approximations to the exact solution fostered the formulation of a elaborate formalism , called self - consistent rpa @xcite , which as in the conventional particle - hole theory , allowed to take into account the nucleon correlations without explicitly constructing the ground - state wave function . in ref.@xcite within the schematic two - level lipkin - meshkov - glick(lmg ) model @xcite it is found that the self - consistent theory allows one to go beyond the point of rpa collapse , but near this point the wave function of the first excited state within this approximation is found to be almost orthogonal to the exact one .",
    "this behavior is due to the higher order particle - hole admixtures contributing to the structure of the first excited state .",
    "we note that beside the aforementioned amendments to the standard rpa , there exist a number of other important developments on this subject as , for example , those in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we keep using the explicit form of the fermionic many - body vacuum @xcite but depart from varying the excited - state wave function . on the contrary we use",
    "the correlation coefficients as parameters which we fix by optimizing the ground - state trial wave function using a variational procedure .",
    "the excited states corresponding to such vacuum state are of @xmath1 type .",
    "this approach also benefits from the findings in ref.@xcite where it was shown that this class of wave functions is a vacuum for a generalized phonon operator , adding to the standard one specific two - body operators correcting for the pauli principle . by way of example , using the two - level lmg model , they showed that the additional terms improve the convergence substantially . in this way",
    "the phonon vacuum state absorbs additional correlations effects than the ones obtained using the equations - of - motion method @xcite for the standard phonon operator .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows . in section [ sec : formalism ] we outline the problem and summarize the main obstacles towards the exact solution . basic equations of several approximate methods including the rpa , erpa and the explicit variation of the phonon vacuum state along with the exact solution within the lmg model are derived in section [ sec : lmg ] . a comparison between them is established on the basis of the ground and the first excited state energies as well as the on ground - state particle occupation numbers in section [ sec : numerics ] . summary and outlook is given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "we assigned @xmath90 particles to the system for a simple reason - if we consider the two levels of the lmg model representing the valence sub - shells in the nucleus then these would be the source of the major effects for the low - lying states and @xmath89 would mimic the neutron or proton subsystem of a nucleus from the middle of @xmath91 major shell .    the first observation in fig .",

    "however , as seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : e ] and [ fig : rho ] , increasing the interaction strength beyond the rpa critical point causes progressive divergence of this solution from the exact one for both the ground - state energy and the occupation number .",
    "this divergence exacerbates incrementing the number of particles in the system . adding higher order terms to the energy functional in eq . , which account for further correlations effects , greatly improves the results bringing the energy of the phonon vacuum and the occupation number closer to the exact value . the importance of the multi - particle - hole admixtures to the ground state in the strong interaction regime",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : components ] where the weight of the ground state s @xmath93 component is plotted as function of the interaction strength @xmath34 .",
    "dispite the reasonable agreement for the ground - state energies in this regime the wave function of the phonon vacuum yields a substantially less correlated state than the true ground state.the prescription of the variational principle for monotonic convergence is easily seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : e],[fig : rho ] , [ fig : components ] and [ fig : e_excited ] as the higher order correlations bring the result closer to the exact solution but never overbinding the ground state .",
    "the behaviour of the first excited state s energy within the phonon vacuum variational approach exhibits a collapse at interaction strengths far weaker than those at which the first excited state energy starts to diminish ( see fig.[fig : e_excited ] ) .",
    "the position of this point is very much independent of the order of multi - particle - hole correlations included in the phonon vacuum state in cases when this point is near @xmath94 ( eq . ) as in the weak interaction regime admixtures beyond the @xmath0 ones contribute relatively little ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : components ] ) .",
    "the obvious reason for this collapse , as noted in @xcite , can be attributed to the higher order particle - hole admixtures contributing in the structure of the first excited state which start to be an important factor as the interaction becomes stronger .    as opposed to the rpa , a real erpa solution ,",
    "is found everywhere in the range of @xmath34 values considered . in the interval",
    "@xmath95 $ ] it performs just as well as the rpa does except for strengths close to @xmath94 . in the strong interaction regime",
    "the erpa gives rather good results both for the particle occupation and the first excited state energy ( see figs . [",
    "fig : rho ] and [ fig : e_excited ] ) . near and beyond @xmath94",
    "it predicts higher depletion of the lower lmg level ( see fig.[fig : rho ] ) and correspondingly , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_excited ] , it gives lower value for the energy of the first excited state . at interactions twice as strong as the rpa point of collapse",
    "the first excited state s energy is found to be a bit higher compared to the exact solution .",
    "this result is to be expected given that the particle occupation number at such strengths within the erpa is overestimated .",
    "it is worth noticing that in the strong interaction regime a solution of the system of coupled equations , and is found for an occupation number whose value @xmath96 is in very close proximity to the critical occupation number    @xmath97",
    "in this work we initiated the development of a variational approach for approximating the ground state of nuclei using a wave function in the form of the phonon vacuum state , tailored to take into account the action of the long - range residual forces .",
    "essentially it is an attempt to provide a controlled succession of approximations for estimating the contributions from different multi - particle - hole admixtures .",
    "applying our idea to the very schematic lmg model , we showed the superiority of our approach over the rpa , based on comparison with the exact solution for the ground and first - excited state energies as well as based on the particle occupation numbers . alongside that we adapted the erpa @xcite to the lmg model to show its high utility within a wide range of interaction strengths .",
    "as far as the lmg model is able to simulate real nuclei , we conclude the following :    * the rpa point of collapse separates two types of system s behavior - the weak and strong interaction regimes . * the rpa provides an accurate and computationally efficient method to treat nuclei until the point of collapse inherent to this approximation . *",
    "the erpa improves over the standard rpa as it yields solution for any interaction strength . the calculated value for the first excited state s energy is the closest to the exact one amongst all considered approximations .",
    "the ground state occupation numbers within this approximation are also reproduced with reasonable accuracy . * explicitly varying the phonon vacuum state one obtains a very good accuracy to the ground - state energy as the result improves monotonically adding higher order correlations into the ground state . in the region beyond the rpa point of collapse ,",
    "multiple particle - hole admixtures higher than @xmath0 ones start to play very important role and at such strengths , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : components ] , the phonon vacuum solution significantly underestimates the degree of correlation .",
    "this effect is amplified with the increase of the number of particles in the system . *",
    "the energy of the first excited state can be treated as an @xmath1 excitation over the ground state only in the weak interaction regime until the rpa point of collapse . beyond that point",
    "it vanishes rapidly especially for systems with a larger number of particles and its proper description requires consideration within and extended configuration space for the excited states .    applying the presented approach to real nuclei",
    "one can expect to obtain improved results than previously published for isotopes from the transitional regions.being a many - body wave function this approach may be a good choice for describing phenomena involving many - particle correlations as , for example , cluster configurations .",
    "the influence of the long - range residual forces on the mean field and the pairing correlations in real nuclei is another perspective which the presented development makes possible to realize and it is currently progressing .",
