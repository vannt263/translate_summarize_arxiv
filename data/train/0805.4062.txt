    "during the past few years , some important concepts in quantum information theory have been introduced to characterize quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) .",
    "for example , entanglement , which is one of the central concepts in quantum information theory , has been investigated extensively in qpts in various models , like ising model osterloh : nature416,physreva.69.022107,latorre:064101,barthel:220402 and lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model @xcite .",
    "recently , fidelity , which is another important quantum information concept , has also been applied in characterizing qpts .",
    "the introducing of fidelity  in qpts is natural @xcite , since it s mathematically the overlap between two states , while qpts are just dramatic changes in ground - state properties .",
    "however , the fidelity used in the study of qpts depends computationally on an arbitrary yet finite small change of the driving parameter . to cancel the arbitrariness , zanardi et al",
    ". introduced the riemannian metric tensor @xcite , while you et al . suggested the fidelity susceptibility @xcite",
    "the fidelity susceptibility then becomes an effective tool to study critical properties @xcite in many - body systems .",
    "it s noticed that all the above works are concentrated on the fidelity of the global ground states , and we may call this kind of fidelity susceptibility the global fidelity susceptibility .",
    "however , in experiments , one always probe the subsystem but not the whole system for practical convenience .",
    "here we use the reduced fidelity @xcite ( also called partial fidelity in @xcite ) susceptibility ( rfs ) , which describes the fidelity susceptibility of a subsystem . in this work , first we derive a general formula of the reduced fidelity susceptibility when the reduced density matrix is @xmath0 block - diagonal . then , considering the lmg model , we show that the rfs can be used to characterize qpts , and find that the scaling exponent is different from that of the global fidelity susceptibility .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the concept of fidelity susceptibility , and give a general formula of rfs for a special but interesting case that the density matrix is @xmath1 block - diagonal . then in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce the lmg model lipkin:188 . in the isotropic case , we find that the critical behavior of rfs @xmath2 in response to magnetic transverse field @xmath3 as @xmath4 in thermodynamic limit . while in the anisotropic case , by using the continuous unitary transformations ( cuts )",
    "@xcite , we find that the maximum of @xmath2 over @xmath3 diverged as @xmath5 for an @xmath6-spin system , and @xmath7 in thermodynamic limit . finally , we perform a numerical scaling analysis , and the results are well consistent with our theoretical ones .",
