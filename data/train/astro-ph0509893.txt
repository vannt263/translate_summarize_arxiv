    "at the time einstein decided to apply his equations to the universe , observational data in cosmology was rather scarce , if not inexistent .",
    "hence , instead of relying on observations to constrain the spacetime metric , he postulated the ",
    "cosmological principle , \" the isotropy and homogeneity of the universe . similarly , guided by theoretical prejudice",
    ", einstein assumed that the universe was static , which , incidentally , is what forced him to introduce a cosmological constant in his equations .",
    "it turns out that the universe is actually homogeneous and isotropic on large scales , as confirmed , for example , by the homogeneity of the distribution of luminous red galaxies @xcite and the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "however , the universe is not static , and einstein s staticity assumption prevented him from predicting the expansion of the universe later discovered by hubble .",
    "the cosmological principle has a similar , but formally independent counterpart for cosmological perturbations .",
    "it states that perturbations are statistically homogeneous and isotropic , that is , that their correlation functions are invariant under translations and rotations .",
    "these assumptions are so ingrained and integrated into our treatment of cosmological perturbations , that often we are unaware of them . as a consequence ,",
    "the statistical homogeneity and isotropy of cosmological perturbations has received little attention in the literature , and only recently the large scale anomalies observed in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) have led to a spurt of interest in statistical anisotropy .",
    "in fact , the data provided by the wmap cosmic microwave background experiment @xcite , shows hints of violations of statistical isotropy .",
    "these hints include the alignment of the quadrupole and octopole @xcite , unlikely correlations between `` multipole vectors '' @xcite , a north - south asymmetry in the cmb sky @xcite and evidence for the existence of a symmetry plane @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a measure of statistical anisotropy proposed in @xcite shows no evidence for statistical anisotropy , and it has been also suggested that the previous hints are artifacts of the heavily processed maps used to analyze the data @xcite .    in any case , regardless of whether the cmb sky is truly statistically anisotropic or not , the statistical isotropy of cosmological perturbations should be subject to empirical test , rather than taken on faith .",
    "whereas most studies have focused on the statistical isotropy of the cmb sky , in this work we analyze the isotropy of the primordial perturbations themselves . verifying whether cosmological perturbations are statistically anisotropic",
    "is a way to confirm whether our basic assumptions about structure formation , and ultimately our universe , are correct .",
    "it provides a novel way to test our current understanding of the origin of structure , embodied in inflationary models , and it might provide information about the universe at high energies and long wavelengths .    in this work",
    "we are not concerned with the mechanism responsible for the generation of statistically anisotropic primordial perturbations , although if it were impossible to seed them our analysis would be perhaps an academic exercise .",
    "the most straightforward mechanism to explain statistical anisotropies involves isotropy violations in the background spacetime itself .",
    "these departures from isotropy can arise from non - trivial spatial topologies @xcite or departures from the _ background _ friedmann - robertson - walker metric @xcite .",
    "however , these explanations require the breaking of isotropy from the onset , and they also clash with our understanding of the origin of structure . alternatively",
    ", statistical anisotropies might arise from coherent magnetic fields in the universe @xcite .",
    "if these magnetic fields can be regarded as perturbations in an isotropic spacetime , their contribution to the metric perturbations is quadratic in the fields , and hence presumably highly suppressed . on the other hand ,",
    "if they significantly contribute to the energy density of the universe , one expects deviations from isotropy at the level of the background spacetime itself , violating again isotropy from the onset . in this paper",
    "we assume that the universe is homogeneous , isotropic , spatially flat and practically infinite . but even homogeneous and isotropic universes can be dominated by sets of non - vanishing non - scalar background fields if the latter appear in special configurations , like for example , vector field triads . in these universes , perturbations are expected to be statistically anisotropic @xcite . in general the existence of these non - vanishing fields",
    "signals the spontaneous breaking of lorentz - invariance @xcite ( rotational invariance to be more precise ) , so the study of statistical anisotropies in the primordial perturbations opens a new window to test the basic symmetries of nature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : formalism ] we precisely define what we mean by statistically isotropic or anisotropic primordial perturbations .",
    "it is in this section where we introduce a quantitative characterization of primordial statistical anisotropies . in section",
    "[ sec : temperature ] we connect statistical anisotropies in the primordial perturbations to statistical anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background temperature fluctuations .",
    "we define statistics that capture the amount of statistical anisotropy in the cmb and at the same time mirror the amount of anisotropy in the primordial density ripples , and we also discuss the relation between our statistics and the bipolar spectrum of hajian and souradeep @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : looking ] contains a description of strategies to test and constrain the statistical isotropy of the primordial perturbations .",
    "this task is simplified if there is a cut - off in the anisotropies at a particular arbitrary multipole , which is the case we mainly consider . as an illustration of the formalism ,",
    "we look for the simplest departure from statistical isotropy : a preferred direction in the primordial perturbations .",
    "we apply our statistics to the full sky cmb maps and do not find evidence of statistical anisotropy .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we have also included an appendix where we summarize most of the formulae that we need in our derivations .",
    "consider a real gaussian random field in euclidean ( flat ) three - dimensional space , @xmath0 . at this point",
    "it is not important to know what @xmath1 actually is , although the reader can think of @xmath1 as the newtonian potential ( in longitudinal gauge @xcite ) .",
    "the isometries of euclidean space consist of translations , rotations and reflections @xcite .",
    "it is therefore useful to analyze how random fields behave under these transformations .",
    "the gaussian random field @xmath1 is _ statistically homogeneous _ if its momenta are invariant under translations , @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes ensemble average .",
    "is real by assumption , @xmath4 .",
    "we include the complex conjugation in the two - point function for convenience .",
    "] it is not essential to assume that the field is gaussian .",
    "this assumption just allows us to concentrate on the average @xmath5 and the correlation @xmath6 , which uniquely characterize the statistical properties of the random field in this case .",
    "a non - gaussian field that does not satisfy equations ( [ eq : homogeneous ] ) is not statistically homogeneous either .",
    "the average @xmath5 of a statistically homogeneous random field is a constant in space , and hence is trivially invariant under rotations .",
    "a gaussian random variable @xmath1 is _ statistically isotropic _ ( around @xmath7 ) if its momenta are invariant under rotations ( around @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 if we assume that the field is statistically homogeneous , equations ( [ eq : isotropic ] ) are satisfied for all points @xmath9 if they are satisfied for a single @xmath7 ( say , the origin @xmath10 . )",
    "conversely , one can also show that if a random field @xmath1 fulfills equations ( [ eq : isotropic ] ) for all possible points @xmath7 , then it also fulfills equations ( [ eq : homogeneous ] ) .",
    "in other words , if a random field is statistically isotropic around all points , it is statistically homogeneous . note that it is not necessary to discuss the statistical properties of @xmath1 under inversions",
    ". the inversion of a single point can be accomplished by a translation , and the inversion of two points can be accomplished by a rotation .",
    "often it is convenient to decompose spatial functions in eigenvectors of the translation operator . in flat space",
    "these are the plane waves @xmath11 .",
    "let us hence consider a fourier decomposition of the random field , @xmath12 the components @xmath13 ) are random fields in fourier space . in this space , the requirement of statistical homogeneity ( [ eq : homogeneous ] ) translates into @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ( constant ) mean of @xmath1 and @xmath16 denotes the power spectrum , which is an arbitrary positive definite function .",
    "] of @xmath17 .",
    "on the other hand , the requirement of statistical isotropy ( [ eq : isotropic ] ) implies @xmath18 that is , that the power spectrum only depends on the magnitude @xmath19 of the wave vector @xmath17 .",
    "because any positive function can be written as a square , we can express the power spectrum as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a real function by definition .",
    "then , the random variable @xmath1 is statistically isotropic if and only if @xmath21 only depends on @xmath19 .    in this paper , we consider statistically anisotropic primordial perturbations , that is , primordial perturbations whose power spectrum does not only depend on the magnitude @xmath19 .",
    "it is hence going to be useful to decompose @xmath22 into components that transform differently under rotations of the wave vector , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and the @xmath25 are spherical harmonics . because @xmath22 is real , the complex functions @xmath26 satisfy @xmath27 .",
    "this decomposition of @xmath21 carries over to the power spectrum itself . inserting equation ( [ eq : phi_expansion ] ) into equation ( [ eq : phi_definition ] ) and using relation ( [ eq : three_spherical ] )",
    "we find that @xmath28 and the real coefficient @xmath29 is given by equation ( [ eq : d ] ) .",
    "if the random field is statistically isotropic , @xmath30 for @xmath31 . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath1 is statistically anisotropic , there exists at least one @xmath31 and @xmath32 such that @xmath33 . for simplicity",
    "we shall express our results mostly in terms of @xmath34 , though the reader should be aware that the actual free parameters that characterize the statistical anisotropies are the @xmath35 .",
    "observe that because @xmath36 is real , @xmath37 , which also follows from the relation ( [ eq : p_lm ] ) .",
    "sometimes , one is interested in random fields @xmath38 that are defined not on @xmath39 , but rather on a two - sphere , @xmath40 .",
    "the standard case is the temperature fluctuations on the cosmic microwave background sky .",
    "because the isometries of a sphere consist only of rotations and inversions , for gaussian fields it suffices to consider the properties of the random field under rotations ( the behavior of the cmb under inversions has been studied in @xcite . ) a gaussian random field is _ statistically isotropic _ if the average @xmath41 and the two - point function @xmath42 are invariant under rotations , @xmath43 in the applications we have in mind , random fields on a sphere receive weighted contributions from an infinite number of fourier modes .",
    "for instance , the temperature fluctuations measured by an observer at @xmath44 in the direction @xmath45 can be written as @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath1 is a random field in fourier space and @xmath47 is a real function .",
    "we shall specify what @xmath1 and @xmath47 represent below . at this point , we just want to know what constraints statistically isotropy of @xmath48 imposes on the quantities @xmath47 .",
    "first , note that it follows from equation ( [ eq : delta_expansion ] ) that if @xmath1 is statistically homogeneous , @xmath49 is invariant under rotations if @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , inserting the expansion ( [ eq : delta_expansion ] ) into the second equation in ( [ eq : sphere_isotropic ] ) we arrive at the condition @xmath51=0.\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath48 is statistically isotropic if @xmath52 note that the two - point function @xmath53 does not depend on @xmath44 if the random field @xmath1 is statistically homogeneous .",
    "our main concern here are the contribution of scalar perturbations to the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "let us denote by @xmath54 the temperature fluctuations measured by an observer at @xmath55 looking at direction @xmath45 in the sky . as hinted above , it is more convenient to study the fourier transform of the previous fluctuations , @xmath56 . in linear perturbation theory ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath56 is described by a set of decoupled differential equations for each mode @xmath17 .",
    "the linearity of these equations allows us to separate the initial conditions from the evolution .",
    "in particular , for adiabatic initial conditions one can write @xmath57 where @xmath47 is the temperature fluctuation one obtains by evolving the perturbation equations from initial conditions where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the value of the newtonian potential at a sufficiently early time , well into the radiation dominated era . note that this split between evolution and initial conditions is arbitrary to some extent : what we consider as initial conditions here might be regarded for instance as the outcome of an inflationary stage .",
    "recall now our discussion of statistical isotropy of a random field defined on a sphere .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ eq : origins ] ) that violations of statistical isotropy in the cmb sky might originate from two sources : from the initial conditions ( encoded in the power spectrum @xmath36 ) , or from the evolution ( encoded in the transfer function @xmath47 ) . in this work",
    "we assume that the evolution does not generate statistically anisotropic perturbations , that is , we assume that @xmath60 for all rotation matrices @xmath61 in @xmath62 .",
    "this is the case in cosmological models where the universe does not contain any non - scalar background field , like in the standard @xmath63cdm scenario .",
    "@xcite . for example , if there exists a background vector field @xmath64 in the universe , the scalar @xmath65 is not invariant under @xmath66 . ] as a consequence , the differential equations that describe the evolution of the perturbations are invariant under rotations of @xmath17 and @xmath45 , and it follows that @xmath67 ) is a function of the two scalars one can construct out of @xmath17 and @xmath45 , namely @xmath19 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "this property then allows us to expand @xmath70 in legendre polynomials @xmath71 , @xmath72 this expansion will turn to be useful to compute the two - point function of the temperature anisotropies .",
    "it is customary to characterize the properties of the temperature fluctuations by the angular two - point function @xmath73 , where the @xmath74 are the coefficients in the spherical harmonic decomposition @xmath75 and @xmath44 is our position in space ( because of statistical homogeneity , the statistical properties of the temperature fluctuations do not depend on @xmath44 . )",
    "we would like to express this angular two - point function in terms of the initial power spectrum . using the expansion ( [ eq : expansion_legendre ] ) and the addition theorem ( [ eq : addition - theorem ] ) we find first @xmath76 then , using the definition of the power spectrum ( [ eq : power - spectrum ] ) and its expansion in spherical harmonics ( [ eq : spherical_power ] ) we arrive at our sought result @xmath77 and we have used equation ( [ eq : three_spherical ] ) in the appendix .",
    "the structure of the two - point function can be understood in the language of addition of angular momenta .",
    "the @xmath78 multipole of the primordial anisotropies can be thought of as a state with angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the temperature perturbation @xmath81  creates \" angular momentum with quantum numbers @xmath82 , and , similarly , @xmath83 destroys angular momentum with quantum numbers @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the contribution of @xmath34 to the two - point function vanishes if the angular momenta @xmath85 and @xmath78 can not add to @xmath84 .",
    "in fact , @xmath29 is zero unless @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "in general it is only possible to compute the transfer functions @xmath88 in equation ( [ eq : k ] ) numerically . in order to provide a better handle on statistical anisotropies , in the following",
    "we consider a limit where it is possible to analyze them analytically , namely , on large angular scales",
    ". as it is well known , on these scales , neglecting the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , the sachs - wolfe relation @xmath89 holds @xcite , where @xmath90 denotes the comoving distance to last scattering .. ] it is important to realize that this result is an approximation with a limited range of validity . in particular , at @xmath91 the integrated sachs - wolfe effect modifies .",
    "since we do not know what is causing cosmic acceleration , this is just a guess .",
    "other forms of dark energy lead to different isw effects . ]",
    "the relation ( [ eq : delta_approximation ] ) @xcite , and at @xmath92 , the baryon velocity significantly contributes to the temperature anisotropies @xcite .",
    "therefore , the approximation ( [ eq : delta_approximation ] ) is only valid around @xmath93 .    just as one parametrizes the primordial spectrum in terms of an amplitude and a spectral index ,",
    "let us parameterize the different components of the anisotropies @xmath26 as power laws .",
    "it follows then from equation ( [ eq : p_lm ] ) that @xmath34 is a superposition of different power - laws , with different amplitudes and spectral indices .",
    "let us assume for simplicity , and without loss of generality that @xmath94 in this case , the integral in equation ( [ eq : k ] ) can be explicitly evaluated . using equations ( 11.4.33 ) and ( 15.1.20 ) in @xcite",

    "however , we do not know what @xmath96 or @xmath97 , are . under these circumstances ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : explicit_k ] ) in combination with ( [ eq : two - point ] ) could be used to fit for the values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( see below . )      if primordial perturbations are statistically isotropic ( @xmath30 for @xmath31 ) , one can easily verify that the two point function ( [ eq : two - point ] ) is diagonal . in this case",
    "it is customary to define the angular power spectrum @xmath98 through @xmath99 but if perturbations are statistically anisotropic the two - point function is not diagonal , and the definition of the angular power spectrum above is meaningless . in any case , one never measures the @xmath98 s directly .",
    "instead , one uses an appropriate estimator to infer their values . here",
    "we shall define the @xmath98 s as the expectation value of the estimator that is commonly used to compute the latter , @xmath100 the angular power spectrum defined this way is invariant under rotations .",
    "it reduces to ( [ eq : conventional_c ] ) if perturbations are statistically isotropic and it is also closer to the quantities that we actually measure .",
    "note however that in the presence of statistical anisotropies , the @xmath98 s defined in this way do not completely characterize the statistical properties of the temperature fluctuations , since the two - point function is not diagonal .",
    "we want to find out now how the angular power spectrum is related to the primordial power spectrum .",
    "to this end , we substitute equation ( [ eq : two - point ] ) into the definition ( [ eq : c_l ] ) . using then the identity equation ( [ eq : d_identity ] ) we get @xmath101 therefore , @xmath102 acts like an effective power spectrum .",
    "if primordial perturbations are statistically isotropic , then the effective power spectrum reduces to the conventional power spectrum , @xmath103 .",
    "otherwise , the effective power spectrum receives contributions from all anisotropy components , @xmath104 where we have used equations ( [ eq : orthonormality ] ) and ( [ eq : complex - conjugation ] ) . let us stress that the angular power spectrum defined in equation ( [ eq : c_l ] ) does not differentiate between the different anisotropy multipoles .",
    "a scale invariant monopole perturbation ( @xmath105 ) leads to the same set of @xmath98 s as a scale invariant anisotropy in any other multipole ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "hence , conventional numerical codes , such as cmbfast @xcite , or cmbeasy @xcite can be used to determine the imprints of statistical anisotropies on the angular power spectrum .",
    "alternatively , one can use equation ( [ eq : explicit_k ] ) to explicitly evaluate the @xmath98 s on large  but not too large  angular scales .",
    "the power in the different multipoles of the primordial perturbations @xmath106 uniquely determines the different two - point functions of the temperature anisotropies .",
    "the latter are observables , provided that sufficient realizations of the random field are available .",
    "therefore , one can hope to determine what the @xmath34 are , or at least , place upper limits on their amplitude .",
    "this section is devoted to the ultimate goal of finding ways to measure @xmath34 .",
    "the first obstacle we have to find in our quest to measure @xmath34 is that the power is hidden behind a convolution , equation ( [ eq : k ] ) . even if primordial perturbations are statistically isotropic it is difficult to invert that integral in order to find the primordial power @xcite .",
    "therefore , as a first step towards our goal we shall concentrate in determining the integral @xmath107 in equation ( [ eq : k ] ) . because @xmath108 vanishes when @xmath30 , we can think of @xmath107 as a measure of the anisotropic power ; a non - vanishing @xmath107 for @xmath109 would automatically imply the existence of statistically anisotropic primordial perturbations .",
    "the advantage of focusing on @xmath107 is that we do not have to know what the transfer functions @xmath110 are .",
    "therefore we can analyze all angular scales without having to make any assumptions about the underlying cosmology .",
    "the task of determining some of the values of @xmath107 is greatly simplified when the anisotropies have a cut - off at at multipole @xmath111 , @xmath112 for @xmath113 . in this case , it follows from equation ( [ eq : spherical_power ] ) that the power @xmath34 is cut - off for multipoles @xmath114 .",
    "let us drop the factor of two and assume that @xmath30 for @xmath113 , with @xmath115 even . in this case ,",
    "@xmath108 vanishes for @xmath113 and",
    "we can use the two - point function to directly determine the values of @xmath107 for @xmath111 . at the end of this subsection",
    ", we shall comment on how to iteratively establish whether there exists a putative cut - off at @xmath111 .",
    "consider equation ( [ eq : two - point ] ) with @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "then , due to the properties of angular momentum addition @xmath118 which allows to directly solve for @xmath107 in terms of the two - point function .",
    "however , the two - point function is not directly observable . in order to measure @xmath107",
    "we need a sufficient number of realizations of the random process . at this point , note that the value of @xmath107 does not depend on @xmath80 .",
    "hence we can define the following unbiased estimator , @xmath119 for @xmath120 , our estimator @xmath121 gives the @xmath98 s , equation ( [ eq : c_l ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath121 can be regarded as a generalization of the angular power spectrum .",
    "however , note that for @xmath122 the variable @xmath121 is not a scalar , and , in particular , does not transform under an irreducible representation of the rotation group .",
    "let us stress here an additional property of @xmath121 .",
    "namely , because @xmath121 is quadratic in the temperature fluctuations , our study of isotropy is decoupled of issues about non - gaussianity .",
    "if the expectation value of @xmath121 does not vanish for @xmath123 , primordial perturbations are statistically anisotropic , irrespective of whether temperature anisotropies are gaussian or not .",
    "however , we can not measure @xmath124 directly , and the different realizations of the random process @xmath121 are expected to fluctuate around its expectation value .",
    "it is here where we have to make additional assumptions about the nature of the fluctuations . in order to estimate the variance of @xmath121 ,",
    "let us assume for simplicity that perturbations are gaussian and statistically isotropic .",
    "this assumption is justified because we are attempting to detect the existence of statistical anisotropies .",
    "then , under these conditions , we find that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath121 are uncorrelated , and for @xmath122 @xmath125 we encounter here the same cosmic variance problem one faces when trying to measure the angular power spectrum . because for a given @xmath79 we only have a finite number of samples of the two - point function , @xmath126 , we can not measure @xmath127 with infinite precision . by the way , note that if the value of the estimator happens to be consistent with zero , then we guessed incorrectly , and primordial anisotropies are not cut - off at @xmath111 , but eventually at @xmath128 .",
    "as we shall see , the orientation - dependence of our statistic @xmath121 makes the analysis of temperature anisotropies rather cumbersome .",
    "therefore , it may be advantageous to use an estimator of @xmath107 that possesses well - defined properties under rotations . in order to construct it ,",
    "let us consider the quadratic combination @xmath129 where @xmath130 is a clebsch - gordan coefficient .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath131 is nothing else but the bipolar spherical harmonic of hajian and souradeep @xcite .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that under rotations @xmath131 transforms under an irreducible representation of the rotation group , @xmath132 where @xmath29 is the wigner matrix of the rotation .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : two - point ] ) , we can express the expectation value of @xmath131 ( the bipolar coefficients ) in terms of our quantity @xmath107 , @xmath133 again , the previous expression simplifies if there is an anisotropy cut - off at multipoles @xmath113 . in that case",
    ", one can use the previous expression as a guidance to derive an unbiased estimator of @xmath107 , @xmath134 which is guaranteed to transform appropriately under rotations .",
    "however , as opposed to the previous case , we only have one realization of the quantity we are trying to estimate , so our estimator suffers from a larger cosmic variance . as a matter of fact , the mean square fluctuations of @xmath135 are given by @xmath136 where we have used equations ( [ eq : d ] ) and ( [ eq : symmetry ] ) and , once again , we have assumed that perturbations are statistically anisotropic .",
    "it is apparent from the last equation , that the variance of @xmath121 , equation ( [ eq : k_variance ] ) , is smaller that the one of @xmath135 . in this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on the lower variance estimator @xmath121 ; we reserve the study of @xmath135 and related quantities to a hopefully forthcoming publication .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us comment on the relation between our integral @xmath107 and the bipolar spectrum we briefly mentioned during our previous discussion .",
    "in order to characterize the statistical anisotropy of the cmb sky , hajian and souradeep @xcite define the bipolar spherical coefficient to be , up to a sign , the expectation value of @xmath131 , equation ( [ eq : bipolar ] ) . in that respect @xmath108 , equation ( [ eq : two - point ] ) , and",
    "the bipolar spherical coefficients are similar : both vanish if the cmb sky is statistically isotropic and viceversa . to reduce the errors of their estimates , hajian and souradeep also define the bipolar spectrum , which is quadratic in the bipolar spectrum coefficients , and hence quartic in the @xmath74 s .",
    "we have not followed this path here , but have defined instead suitable estimators that are quadratic in the temperature fluctuations .",
    "the main difference between out approach and the one of @xcite though is the physical focus . whereas the authors of @xcite are concerned with the statistical properties of the cmb by itself , we are ultimately interested in the statistical properties of the primordial perturbations .",
    "hence , our statistics @xmath121 and @xmath135 ( and as we shall see also @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) mirror the properties of the primordial perturbations and owe its definition to a possible origin of statistical anisotropies in the cmb .",
    "our analysis so far has been fairly general .",
    "we have not made any strong assumptions about the nature of the primordial perturbations , the content of the universe or the angular scales involved .",
    "this is why our handle on statistical anisotropies is not as strong as it could be . at this point",
    "we shall trade generality for constraining power . on large angular scales ,",
    "the integral @xmath107 can be explicitly evaluated , equation ( [ eq : explicit_k ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can use large angular scales to explicitly determine the power in the primordial anisotropy multipoles .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that the power @xmath34 is scale invariant in the scales of interest , @xmath139 . in a more sophisticated analysis we would try to fit for the value of the spectral index @xmath97 . setting accordingly @xmath140 in equation ( [ eq : explicit_k ] ) we find that the integral is proportional to @xmath141 \\gamma[(l_2+l_1)/2 ] }          { \\gamma[(l_1-l_2 + 3)/2]\\gamma[(l_2-l_1 + 3)/2]\\gamma[(l_2+l_1 + 4)/2]},\\ ] ] which does not depend on @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , substituting its value into equation ( [ eq : k_estimator ] ) we arrive at the following estimator for the amplitude @xmath142 @xmath143 where @xmath115 is again the multipole above which the power in the multipoles is cut - off .",
    "note that we have actually found a set of estimators ( one for each @xmath79 ) of the very same amplitude @xmath142 .",

    "when applied to the full - sky maps of the cmb temperature fluctuations currently available , the former statistics do not lead to evidence for statistical anisotropy , although the analysis is obscured by the strong variations of our estimators with the map orientation .",
    "the statistical isotropy of the primordial perturbations is an observational issue . as with gaussianity , scale invariance or adiabaticity",
