    "<S> we find that the modified sine  </S>",
    "<S> gordon equation belonging to the class of the soliton equations describes the propagation of extremely short transverse acoustic pulses through the low - temperature crystal containing paramagnetic impurities with effective spin @xmath0 in the voigt geometry case . </S>",
    "<S> the features of nonlinear dynamics of strain field and effective spins , which correspond to the different kinds of acoustic solitons , are studied .    </S>",
    "<S> the development of physical acoustics has led to the appearance of technical tools of producing and measuring acoustic pulses about @xmath1@xmath2 in duration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristics of such pulses are very perspective for diagnostics of fast processes and spectroscopy of solids . </S>",
    "<S> this attracts large attention to theoretical study of the interaction of picosecond acoustic pulses with paramagnetic crystals and other nonlinear media [ 38 ] . </S>",
    "<S> usually , the semiclassical approach is employed to derive the equations governing the evolution of acoustic pulses . </S>",
    "<S> some of these equations occur to be integrable with the help of the inverse scattering transformation ( ist ) method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the systems of integrable equations that generalize well - known integrable models of nonlinear coherent optics @xcite describe the propagation of transverse - longitudinal picosecond pulses @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    the duration of picosecond acoustic pulses may be comparable with the oscillation period of the quantum transitions involved into the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> following well - known parallels between the nonlinear phenomena in coherent optics and physical acoustics @xcite , one has to treat acoustic pulses in this case as extremely short pulses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is necessary in so doing to take into account essential difference between acoustic and optical waves . </S>",
    "<S> the linear velocities of the components of the former can differ significantly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the longitudinal component velocity is normally much higher than the transverse ones . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear interaction of these components is weak in that case , and , consequently , longitudinal and transverse picosecond acoustic pulses propagate independently . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , transverse components can interact efficiently since their linear velocities are equal under propagation along the acoustic symmetry axis of the crystal .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the acoustic extremely short pulses in the low - temperature paramagnetic crystal in the external magnetic field presence . in accordance with above </S>",
    "<S> mentioned parallels between coherent optics and physical acoustics , we apply here the spectral overlap approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is based on condition @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the characteristic frequency of quantum transitions created by the external field ; @xmath5 is the pulse duration . </S>",
    "<S> the main aim of the present article is to clarify the role of nonlinear interaction of the acoustic pulse components . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose for this reason that the pulses are especially transverse .    </S>",
    "<S> let a tetragonal ( or cubic ) crystal contain paramagnetic impurities with effective spin @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> assume that the cartesian axes @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are aligned with symmetry axes of the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> let the transverse acoustic pulse propagate along the @xmath6 axis and the external magnetic field @xmath9 be parallel to the @xmath8 axis ( voigt geometry ) . </S>",
    "<S> consider the one - dimensional case with dynamical variables depending on coordinate @xmath6 and time @xmath10 only . </S>",
    "<S> then , the hamiltonian @xmath11 of the spin - elastic interaction has the form @xcite @xmath12 .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is the frequency of the zeeman splitting of the kramers doublets ; @xmath14 is the lande factor ; @xmath15 is the bohr magneton ; @xmath16 ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the components of the strain tensor ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the cartesian components of the local displacement vector @xmath21 ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the components of the tensor of the spin - elastic interaction ( in voigt notation ; subscript  0  means differentiation at the absence of acoustic pulse ) ; @xmath24 are the components of the lande tensor ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the pauli matrices ; @xmath27 is the planck constant . from the microscopic point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the spin - elastic coupling appears in the case @xmath0 due to the modulation of the lande tensor components by the strain field @xcite .    in order to achieve fairly efficient interaction between paramagnetic impurities and strain field </S>",
    "<S> , the zeeman splitting energy must exceed the thermal one . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that paramagnetic crystal has to be at helium temperatures , as it was in the experiments on acoustic self - induced transparency @xcite . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the self - absorption of hypersound with frequency @xmath28 ( or the picosecond acoustic pulses ) due to anharmonicity , defects , etc . is appreciably lower than the acoustic absorption due to the presence of paramagnetic impurities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the self - absorption effect playing important role under the room temperatures can be ignored in our case . also , characteristic phase relaxation time for transitions within the zeeman multiplets is @xmath29@xmath30 , and the energy relaxation time is much longer under such conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we neglect these dissipative effects in what follows because the duration of the pulses considered is much shorter than all the relaxation times .    according to the general scheme of the semiclassical approach , </S>",
    "<S> we describe the evolution of effective spins by the equation on density matrix @xmath31 : @xmath32 . \\label{rho_t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , the elastic pulse field obeys the classical hamiltonian equation for continuous medium : @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the momentum density of the local displacement of the crystal ; @xmath36\\rmd\\bi{r } \\label{h_a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the hamiltonian of the free strain field ; @xmath37 is the average density of the crystal ; @xmath38 is the concentration of paramagnetic ions ; @xmath39 is the quantum average value of @xmath11 ; @xmath40 is the linear velocity of transverse acoustic waves . </S>",
    "<S> the integration is carried out over the crystal volume .    </S>",
    "<S> let us introduce the bloch variables @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) are the elements of the density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> then ( [ rho_t ] ) gives @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 with ( [ h ] ) , ( [ ham_1])([h_a ] ) we obtain @xmath48 @xmath49    equations ( [ u_t])([o_l ] ) describe the interaction of the transverse strain field with the paramagnetic crystal in the voigt geometry case . as it is seen from ( [ u_t])([w_t ] ) , @xmath7-component @xmath50 of the acoustic pulse causes quantum transitions between the zeeman sublevels , whereas @xmath8-component @xmath51 shifts dynamically their frequency . for transverse acoustic pulse propagating along the @xmath8 axis ( faraday geometry ) , </S>",
    "<S> both components of the pulse excite quantum transitions only . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - elastic interaction between the components leads in this case to the rotation of the polarization plane of the pulse @xcite ( acoustic faraday effect ) .    </S>",
    "<S> if we put @xmath52 then ( [ u_t ] ) and ( [ w_t ] ) yield @xmath53 let us assume that @xmath54 and the orders of @xmath4 and @xmath51 are comparable . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath55 ( that is @xmath56 ) @xcite , we see that condition ( [ sc ] ) is valid . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the first term in the rhs of ( [ s_t ] ) can be neglected in the approximation of zeroth - order with respect to @xmath57 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then we have @xmath58 or @xmath59 where @xmath60 @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is the inversion of population of the spin sublevels in the acoustic pulse absence . </S>",
    "<S> substitution ( [ uw ] ) into ( [ v_t ] ) gives @xmath63    to simplify further the equations we deal with , let us carry out some numerical estimations . </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath64 , @xmath65 we find from ( [ w_t ] ) that @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ratio @xmath67 of the rhs of equation ( [ o_t ] ) to the terms in its lhs is estimated as @xmath68 . the value of similar parameter of ( [ o_l ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is estimated as @xmath69 . for paramagnetic ions @xmath70 in cubic crystal @xmath71 at helium temperatures we use the following experimental data @xcite : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath77 , then @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> since parameters @xmath67 and @xmath79 are much less than unity , we shall reduce the order of derivatives in ( [ o_t ] ) and ( [ o_l ] ) with the help of the unidirectional propagation approximation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> having introduced new independent variables @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 , we obtain @xmath83 in the first order in @xmath84 , we write @xmath85 for the lhs and rhs of equations ( [ o_t ] ) and ( [ o_l ] ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> integration of the wave equations obtained in this way with respect to @xmath86 , substitution of expressions ( [ uw ] ) and taking into account ( [ r_t_t ] ) give us the following system in the terms of variables @xmath86 and @xmath6 : @xmath87 @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 .    </S>",
    "<S> equations ( [ o_t_z ] ) and ( [ o_l_z ] ) possess the integral of motion : @xmath91 where function @xmath92 is determined by the boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the similar integral was revealed in @xcite . defining new variables @xmath93 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath94 @xmath95 one can prove that @xmath92 is supposed equal to zero without loss of the generality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , we find from ( [ int ] ) : @xmath96 where @xmath97 ( it is seen that inequality @xmath98 is fulfilled . ) </S>",
    "<S> finally , using ( [ theta ] ) , ( [ o_t_z ] ) and ( [ o_s ] ) , we obtain @xmath99    this equation is reduced to the famous sine  gordon ( sg ) equation @xcite if @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ msg ] ) with @xmath101 is known as the modified sg ( msg ) equation [ 1922 ] and belongs to the class of equations integrable by the ist method . </S>",
    "<S> its first physical application was found recently in @xcite , where ( [ msg ] ) was shown to describe the propagation of electromagnetic extremely short pulses through the anisotropic media . in [ 1922 ] , this equation was derived in the course of mathematical study of the bcklund transformation of the sg equation .    </S>",
    "<S> being integrable with the help of the ist method , ( [ msg ] ) admits the zero curvature representation @xmath102=0 ,   \\label{cc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where matrices @xmath103 and @xmath104 are defined as given @xmath105 @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the spectral parameter . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ cc ] ) is nothing but the compatibility condition of the following lax pair @xmath108 where @xmath109 .    to investigate the nonlinear dynamic of the transverse strain field components and effective spins , we construct the soliton solutions of ( [ msg ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the multi - soliton solutions of the integrable equation can be found using the algebraic methods . </S>",
    "<S> here we apply the darboux transformation ( dt ) technique @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath110 be a solution of ( [ lax ] ) with @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> the lax pair ( [ lax ] ) is covariant with respect to dt @xmath112 of the form @xmath113,\\nonumber\\\\ \\tilde\\xi_2=(\\lambda\\xi_2-\\tau_p\\varphi_2\\xi_1/\\varphi_1 ) \\exp[\\rmi(\\theta-\\tilde\\theta)/2],\\nonumber\\\\ \\tilde\\theta=\\theta+\\rmi\\ln\\frac{\\tau_p\\varphi_1 ^ 2-\\tau_c\\varphi_1\\varphi_2 } { \\tau_p\\varphi_2 ^ 2-\\tau_c\\varphi_1\\varphi_2}. \\label{dt1_psi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this implies that relation ( [ dt1_psi ] ) gives us new solution @xmath114 of the msg equation ( [ msg ] ) if @xmath115 is its known solution and @xmath116 is a solution of the lax pair .    </S>",
    "<S> in the zero background case ( i.e. , @xmath117 ) , we obtain from ( [ dt1_psi ] ) the following expression for the one - soliton solution of the msg equation : @xmath118 where @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> velocity @xmath122 of the soliton and its free parameter @xmath5 defining the duration are connected by the relation @xmath123 the corresponding formula for @xmath7-component of the transverse strain field is @xmath124 for  time area </S>",
    "<S>  @xmath125 of this component of the acoustic pulse we find @xmath126    the last formula indicates that the acoustic extremely short pulses are divided into two families . </S>",
    "<S> the family with @xmath127 exists for the sg equation also and corresponds to unipolar @xmath128-pulses ( kinks and antikinks ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pulses of the family with @xmath129 are bipolar @xmath130-pulses . unlike the breathers of the sg equation ( for them @xmath129 as well ) , these pulses are steady - state . </S>",
    "<S> the solitons of this kind were called as neutral kinks in @xcite .    in the cubic crystal , one has @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath132 due to condition ( [ sc ] ) , and neutral kinks exist only in such a crystal . in the crystals with tetragonal symmetry , both types of the solitons are possible .    </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss in details the properties of the acoustic solitons . </S>",
    "<S> in the case @xmath133 , component @xmath50 ( [ o_y_1 ] ) of the unipolar one - soliton solution has a single maximum , whose value is smaller than @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> accompanying dynamics of effective spins is very similar to that of the sg equation : the leading edge of the pulse of @xmath7-component inverts completely the populations of the zeeman sublevels , and the trailing one returns them to the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8-component is small as compared to @xmath4 , and its role is insignificant .    under @xmath135 , component @xmath50 has two symmetric peaks ( see solid line in figure  1a )     for the one - soliton pulses with @xmath135 ( solid lines ) and @xmath132 ( dotted lines),width=259 ]    with the largest possible amplitude @xmath134 determined by ( [ int ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks are separated by the time interval @xmath136 the first peak inverts the populations of the spin sublevels while the component @xmath51 grows in amplitude and reaches the absolute value @xmath137 in the center of the soliton ( figures  1b and 1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the component @xmath51 has an asymmetry on polarity : it decreases the transition frequency ( @xmath138 ) and shifts the zeeman sublevels so that the ground sublevel becomes excited . on account of this , </S>",
    "<S> the paramagnetic ions are in the ground state between the peaks . </S>",
    "<S> ( the positions of the spin sublevels @xmath139 and @xmath140 of the kramers doublet under the pulse passage are pictured in figure  1c . ) when the second peak has come , the @xmath8-component vanishes reverting the mutual position of the sublevels to the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the second peak of @xmath7-component causes the back transitions from excited sublevel to the ground one .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath132 and the interval between the peaks of neutral kink surpasses its duration , the dynamics of the strain fields and effective spins is similar to the second case described above . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference is that the peaks of @xmath50 are opposite in sign . </S>",
    "<S> the time interval between the peaks is @xmath141 if we take duration of such a soliton to be shorter , then the peaks are brought closer together and the degree of excitation of the paramagnetic ions decreases ( see dotted lines in figure  1 ) .    when @xmath142 , the interval between the peaks grows indefinitely large , and @xmath7-component ( [ o_y_1 ] ) consists of a single peak with amplitude equal to @xmath134 and with absolute value of time area @xmath143 equal to @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> this case stresses especially the role of the component @xmath51 of the acoustic pulses considered . </S>",
    "<S> the peak of @xmath50 inverts almost completely the population of the spin sublevels . </S>",
    "<S> this state of the effective spins is unstable in the absence of the strain field . </S>",
    "<S> but , the @xmath8-component , whose amplitude tends to @xmath137 , shifts the levels of the kramers doublets in a such manner that the energy of the excited sublevel becomes lesser than the energy of the ground one . </S>",
    "<S> owing to this , the state of effective spins after the passage of the @xmath7-component peak becomes stable .    </S>",
    "<S> the form of the acoustic solitons in the case @xmath145 ( see integral ( [ int ] ) ) tends to their form in the case @xmath146 at @xmath147 since the pulse velocity @xmath122 differs from linear velocity @xmath40 of the transverse waves . </S>",
    "<S> as it follows from the previous consideration , this means in particular that the amplitude of the pulses is bounded , and the component of the strain field parallel to the external magnetic field has the asymmetry on polarity .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we considered the propagation of the transverse acoustic extremely short pulse through paramagnetic crystal in a direction perpendicular to external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the dynamics of the strain field and effective spins is governed by the modified sine  gordon equation ( [ msg ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the soliton solutions of this equation reveal strong nonlinear coupling between the components of the acoustic pulse . as a result of this , </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of paramagnetic impurities and elastic fields during the interaction exhibits new features . </S>"
