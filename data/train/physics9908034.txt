    "the structural and electronic properties of metal clusters are currently a field of intensive research both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the basic theoretical concept in the electronic structure of alkali metal clusters is the shell model based on jellium sphere ( or ellipsoid ) approximation @xcite , which has successfully interpreted the magic number effect in na@xmath0 and k@xmath0 clusters ( @xmath102 , 8 , 20 , 40 , @xmath11 ) . as compared to alkali - metal clusters , the application of electronic shell model to coinage - metal clusters ( cu@xmath0 , ag@xmath0 , au@xmath0 ) is somewhat questionable due to the existence of inner @xmath4 electrons . among the noble metal clusters ,",
    "ag@xmath0 is expected to exhibit the largest similarity to the alkali metal clusters as the @xmath12 orbitals in ag atom are low - lying and act almost like innershell core orbitals .",
    "experimental studies on silver clusters include mass - spectra @xcite , ionization potentials ( ips ) @xcite , photoelectron spectra @xcite , electron spin resonance ( esr ) @xcite , optical resonance absorption @xcite , etc .",
    "in general , most of the cluster properties resemble the predictions of shell model within one @xmath3 electron picture .",
    "but there are still some experimental evidences for ag@xmath0 that are different from alkali - metal clusters and can not be understood via the shell model of @xmath3 electrons .",
    "for instance , the mie resonance peak of silver clusters exhibit blue shift with decreasing cluster radius @xcite , while red shift of mie resonance frequency is found for alkali - metal clusters . a direct comparison of photoelectron spectra between ag@xmath0 and na@xmath0 display significant difference that might be attributed to the @xmath4 orbitals @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to clarify the contribution of @xmath12 electrons and @xmath13 interaction in the silver clusters and the geometrical effect on the electronic properties of the clusters .    besides shell model ,",
    "the metal clusters have been investigated by accurate quantum chemical approaches based on molecular orbital theory @xcite .",
    "however , such _ ab initio _ calculations on coinage metal clusters are quite time consuming and limited in small size @xcite . among those works , the most detailed and comprehensive study of small neutral silver clusters ( ag@xmath5 to ag@xmath14 ) has been performed via configuration interaction ( ci ) method with relativistic effective core potential ( recp ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the electronic structures of several larger silver clusters has been approximately described by a modified hckel model @xcite .",
    "however , all these studies are carried out for limited number of structural candidates with symmetry constrain .",
    "an unbiased minimization for the cluster ground state structure incorporated with electronic structure calculations would be much more informative for understanding the interplay between geometrical and electronic structure and testing the validity of electronic shell model .    up to now , the most reliable and accurate procedure in dynamic searching of cluster equilibrium geometries is provided by car - parrinello ( cp ) method with simulated annealing ( sa ) @xcite .",
    "but such kind of _ ab initio _ simulation is also limited in small size ( about @xmath15 ) in a truly global optimization because of the rapidly increase in computational expense with cluster size . among coinage metal clusters ,",
    "the cp method has been employed to study small cu@xmath0 clusters ( @xmath16 recently @xcite , but the corresponding investigation on silver and gold clusters is not available so far . in recent years , tight - binding molecular dynamics has been developed as an alternative to cp method in atomistic simulation for larger scaled systems @xcite . as compared to _ ab initio _",
    "methods , the parameterized tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonian reduces the computational cost dramatically .",
    "it is more reliable than classical simulation based on empirical potential since the atomic motion is directly coupled with electronic structure calculation at each steps . for transition - metal clusters , m.menon and co - workers have proposed a minimal parameter tight - binding scheme and used it to study nickel and iron clusters @xcite . in this work , we shall introduce a similar tb model for silver . by using the tbmd as a local minimization approach , genetic algorithm ( ga ) @xcite",

    "the overlap between @xmath3 and @xmath4 band is believed to induce the icosahedral growth sequence starting from ag@xmath90 and weaken the even - odd oscillation in homo - lumo gaps and ips of ag@xmath0 clusters with @xmath113 . however , the overlap between @xmath105 and @xmath4 states is small and the cluster homo is still located in the @xmath3-like electronic states .",
    "consequently , the contribution from @xmath4 electrons in ag@xmath0 with @xmath114 shows more importance to cluster bonding although the electronic behavior close to fermi energy such as homo - lumo gap , ionization potentials is still dominated by @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "= 3.0 in    an important electronic property of a cluster is the gap between highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) . in the case of magic cluster",
    ", the closure of electronic shell shall manifest itself in particularly large homo - lumo gap .",
    "this effect was demonstrated experimentally for small even - sized silver and copper clusters @xcite and theoretically for copper clusters @xcite .",
    "the theoretical homo - lumo gap of ag@xmath0 ( @xmath115 ) along with experimental gap of small clusters ag@xmath0 ( @xmath116 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 ) @xcite are shown in fig.5 .",
    "even - odd oscillation up to ag@xmath94 as well as the particularly large homo - lumo gap at ag@xmath5 , ag@xmath6 , and ag@xmath8 are obtained . as compared to the experimental results for small ag@xmath0 with even size",
    ", the present tb calculation has systematically overestimated the homo - lumo electronic gap by about 0.5 ev . but the size dependent variation of experimental gaps and magic effect in homo - lumo gaps at @xmath102 , 8 are well reproduced .",
    "the even - odd alternation for @xmath117 and magic effect of ag@xmath9 have not been obtained in our calculation .",
    "we suggest these are probably due to the geometrical effect , since the homo - lumo gap of cluster depends sensitively on cluster structure @xcite . in a previous study of homo - lumo gaps of copper clusters @xcite , the maxima gap at ag@xmath6 and ag@xmath9",
    "is found but the even - odd alternation of electronic gap and magic effect for ag@xmath8 have not been obtained .",
    "the vertical ionization potentials ( ips ) of clusters are evaluated from the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) energy of neutral clusters according to koopman s theorem . in fig.6 , the calculated ips of ag@xmath0 up to @xmath60",
    "is compared with the ip values measured by c.jackschath @xcite , the prediction by metallic spherical droplet model @xcite , and the size dependent homo level ( in arbitrary units ) of alkali - like metal clusters by clemenger - nilsson ellipsoid shell model @xcite . in comparison with experimental values in ref.[5 ] , the present tb calculation has almost reproduced the size dependence of ips for silver clusters up to 21 atoms except that theoretical calculation has overestimated the ip values of some magic clusters such as ag@xmath5 , ag@xmath6 , and ag@xmath8 .",
    "two important size dependent behaviors are found in fig.6 : ( i ) dramatic even - odd alternations where clusters with even number of @xmath3 valence electrons have higher ips than their immediate neighbors ; ( ii ) particular higher ip values at the magic clusters such as ag@xmath5 , ag@xmath6 , ag@xmath8 , ag@xmath9 and probably ag@xmath7 .",
    "the even - odd variations can be attributed to electron pairing effect .",
    "odd(even)-sized clusters have an odd(even ) total number of @xmath3 valence electrons and the homo is singly(doubly ) occupied .",
    "the electron in a doubly occupied homo feels a stronger effective core potential since the electron screening is weaker for the electrons in the same orbital than for inner shell electrons .",
    "therefore , the binding energy of a valence electron in a cluster of even size cluster is larger than that of odd one .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the size dependence of ips from tb model is almost in full accordance to clemenger - nilsson shell model .",
    "the magic effect at ag@xmath5 , ag@xmath6 , ag@xmath7 , ag@xmath8 , and ag@xmath9 predicted by electronic shell model is well reproduced even though the cluster geometries and @xmath3-@xmath4 interaction has been considered . on the other hand",
    ", one can found that both the theoretical and experimental ip values for silver clusters can be roughly described by a classical electrostatic model which take the cluster as a metallic spherical droplet .",
    "this fact further suggests that the electronic behavior of silver clusters are predominantly @xmath3-like and the cluster can be approximated to be a structureless jellium sphere with shell - like electronic levels .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the present tb model is able to describe the geometrical and electronic structures of silver clusters . by using a combined ga - tbmd technique , the lowest energy structures , binding energies , electronic states , s - d separation , homo - lumo gap ,",
    "vertical ionization potentials are obtained and compared with experiments .",
    "the main theoretical results can be summarized in the following points :    \\(1 ) the structures of small silver clusters is determined by @xmath3 electrons and similar to those of alkali - metal clusters .",
    "the contribution of @xmath4 electrons to cluster bonding become more important as cluster size exceed 10 atoms .",
    "the icosahedral growth pattern starts in the ag@xmath0 with @xmath118 , which can be identified as `` atomic order '' clusters like noble gas clusters .",
    "\\(2 ) the electronic and geometrical shell structure coexist in silver clusters and take effect in the clusters simultaneously .",
    "the electronic shell effect on cluster electronic properties has been found by present tb calculation , in which the effect of geometrical structures and @xmath4 electrons are directly incorporated .",
    "the silver clusters with closed electronic shell ( @xmath102 , 8 , 14 , 18 , 20 ) show more pronounced electronic characteristics while the geometrical effect is enhanced as the icosahedral shell completes at ag@xmath92 .",
    "\\(3 ) due to the pair occupation of @xmath3 valence electrons on molecular orbitals , silver clusters show even - odd alternation in their relative stability , homo - lumo gap , ionization potential",
    ". however , the even - odd effects can be disturbed by the @xmath119 overlap or the geometrical structures of clusters .",
    "\\(4 ) the density of electronic states of smaller silver cluster , e.g. , @xmath108 , is composed by discrete @xmath105 expanded band and a narrow @xmath4 band .",
    "the bulk - like feature in dos start at around ag@xmath92 and the bulk limit can be roughly reached by @xmath120 .",
    "the present study shows that both the geometrical and electronic effects should be considered in order to achieve a complete description of coinage clusters .",
    "therefore , _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics or tbmd are essential to elucidate the interplay between geometrical and electronic structures of these clusters .",
    "the further works should include the larger clusters and extend the tb model to other transition metal elements .",
