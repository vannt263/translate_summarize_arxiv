    ", the solar activity also exhibits irregular fluctuations and these fluctuations were first assumed to be determined by the short term variation with a random distribution @xcite .",

    "it determines whether the given time series is completely random or has some long - term memory .",
    "et al . _  ( 1994 ) examined whether or not the nonperiodic variations in solar activity are caused by a white - noise , random process .",
    "they evaluated the hurst exponent  for a time series  of @xmath2c data from 6000 bc to 1950 ad .",
    "they find a hurst exponent  of @xmath3 indicating a high degree of persistence in the variations of solar activity .",

    "in all the above studies involving the hurst analysis to understand the persistent behavior of the sunspot data , a single hurst exponent  was estimated although there are many scaling regimes which give different s. in this paper , we use the hurst analysis on 259-year and @xmath1-year data sets and find multiple s in each time series .",
    "we explain the presence of multiple s for a single time series   using systems from deterministic chaotic dynamics with multiple centers of rotation .",
    "our results conclude that estimating a single hurst exponent  from the data where different linear scaling regimes exist may be improper .",

    "@xmath0 is plotted against @xmath5 on log - log axes .",
    "the slope of the linear regression gives the value of the hurst exponent .",
    "if the time series is purely random then the hurst exponent  @xmath26 comes out to be @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath28 , the time series  covers more ` distance ' than a random walk , and is a case of persistent motion , while if @xmath29 , the time series  covers less ` distance ' than a random walk it shows the anti - persistent behavior in time series .",
    "however , for periodic motions , the hurst exponent  is @xmath30 .",
    "sunspot number ( ssn ) is continuously changing in time and constitutes a time series .",

    "the power spectrum of this data set is shown in figure  [ f - spower](a ) .",
    "we further estimate the hurst exponent  for this time series  using the @xmath0 method .",
    "figure  [ f - shurst](a ) shows the log - log plot for the 259-year data showing the presence of multiple hurst exponents for this time series .",
    "the first bending is due to the prominent 11-year cycle and the estimated hurst exponent  1.13 in the linear regime before this bending .",
    "the next prominent bending is at roughly 90 years showing the wolf - gleissberg cycle .",
    "the estimated hurst exponent  in the second linear regime between 11 years and 90 years is 0.83 .",
    "we further analyze the reconstructed sunspot time series  of @xmath1 years ( solanki _ et al .",
    "_ ,  2004 ) shown in figure  [ f - spots](b ) . figure  [ f - spower](b ) shows the power spectrum of this time series  indicating the presence of two long - term periodicities at nearly 2300 and 6000 years .",
    "the @xmath0 analysis also shows two bendings around these periods ( figure  [ f - shurst](b ) ) .",
    "again , for this data set we get two linear regimes , the hurst exponent  of the first part being 0.77 and the second part being 1.26 .",
    "if we were to calculate a single hurst exponent  for these two time series  we will get @xmath31 for 259-year and @xmath32 for @xmath1-year data ( figure [ f - shurst](a ) and ( b ) respectively ) .",
    "these values of the hurst exponent   agree with the previously estimated values of _ h _ in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , as we have demonstrated , the log - log plots of sunspot data show two remarkably distinct scaling regimes and hence estimating only one hurst exponent  may be improper . in the next section",
    "we examine in detail the reasons for these different scaling regimes by using examples of a variety of time series  of standard chaotic systems .",
    "in order to understand the behavior of different dynamical systems using the , we take two extreme examples of time series generated from random and periodic motion respectively .",
    "first we take a random time series with @xmath33 data points distributed uniformly in the range @xmath34 $ ] . using the @xmath0 method we compute the hurst exponent as discussed in section  2 and",
    "find the hurst exponent  @xmath35 as given by the slope of the line in figure  [ f - extreme](a ) , which is expected for a purely random time series  @xcite .",
    "we further consider the other extreme case of a purely periodic signal of period one generated from @xmath36 , with @xmath37 in the range @xmath38 $ ] with step size @xmath39 .",
    "figure  [ f - extreme](b ) shows the plot of @xmath40  vs.   and the slope of the linear regime in this case is @xmath30 .",
    "one prominent difference between these two extreme cases of a purely random signal and a periodic signal ( figure [ f - extreme](a ) and ( b ) respectively ) , is that for a purely random signal , the plot of @xmath40  vs.  has a constant slope , while for a periodic signal it gets saturated and starts oscillating after a certain value of @xmath5 ( marked by an arrow ) .",
    "the value where the bending begins corresponds to the period of oscillation @xmath41 , and has been verified by the power spectrum .",
    "the bending , therefore , gives us information about the frequency of the given signal .      in the past few decades , chaotic motion , observed in deterministic systems ,",
    "has received great attention due to its presence in systems from physical , chemical , biological , ecological , physiological to social sciences .",
    "these chaotic motions are temporally aperiodic and are strange because they have a fractal geometry .",
    "since chaotic motion is neither periodic nor random we can expect its behavior to be in - between two extreme cases of randomness and periodicity .",
    "therefore , we can also expect the hurst exponent  to be different from @xmath27 and @xmath30 .",
    "an example of a system exhibiting chaotic motion is the celebrated rssler  attractor @xcite , @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are control parameters .",
    "a chaotic trajectory ( with @xmath46 , @xmath47  and @xmath48 ) in the @xmath49 plane is shown in figure  [ f - single](a ) which rotates around an unstable period - one fixed point @xmath50 where @xmath51  .",
    "the plot of  @xmath40  vs.   ( figure [ f - single](c ) ) shows that there is linear regime ( before marked arrow ) after which it gets saturated .",
    "the slope of linear region gives @xmath52 .",
    "the first bending of the above - mentioned curve gives the frequency which matches with the frequency obtained from power spectrum or peak to peak analysis of the amplitude .",
    "this system is dissipative and has to be bounded in the sub - phase space  @xcite and the bending here corresponds to the folding nature of the dynamics .    in order to see",
    "if the behavior is replicated in another similar system , we consider the chua oscillator ( chua  _ et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ) , @xmath53    where @xmath54 is defined as , @xmath55 we take @xmath56 , @xmath57 and first select the parameter @xmath58 such that the motion will be a single - scroll type as shown in figure  [ f - single](b ) ( there is a symmetric attractor also , depending upon the initial conditions ) .",
    "the @xmath40  vs.   plot for variable @xmath37 is shown in figure [ f - single](d ) and the hurst exponent  is found to be @xmath52 .",
    "this also shows saturation at the average time period ( shown by arrow ) .",
    "these two examples of chaotic dynamics , rssler  and chua systems , clearly demonstrate that whenever there is a single center of rotation the @xmath40  vs.   plot shows a linear scale only up to the average period of the attractor after which it saturates .",
    "in nature one may come across many dynamical systems which are chaotic and their trajectories rotate around more than one center of rotation .",
    "in order to see the behavior of @xmath40  vs.   plot , we first consider the lorenz system @xcite , @xmath59    shown in figure  [ f - double](a ) is the chaotic trajectory in the @xmath49 plane at parameter values @xmath60 ,",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this clearly shows that the trajectory rotates for some time around the fixed points : + @xmath63 and @xmath64 , + while some time it rotates around all of these fixed points ( including @xmath65 ) .",
    "the @xmath40  vs.   plot in figure  [ f - double](c ) shows that there are two regimes of linear scaling .",
    "the slope of the first part of the linear region gives @xmath66 and the second part gives @xmath67 .",
    "the first linear regime corresponds to the trajectory rotating about individual fixed points while the second is for all three fixed points .",
    "this indicates that the dynamics around individual fixed points is different from that of the combined one . therefore taking",
    "the slope of individual regimes can give more details of the intrinsic dynamics .",
    "this method also allows us to estimate intrinsic frequencies of the system .    in order to see this behavior in another system where chaotic motion contains many unstable fixed points",
    "around which the trajectory revolves , we consider the chua circuit represented by equation  ( [ eq : chua ] ) . figure  [ f - double](b ) shows the trajectory having a double - scroll chaotic motion ( chua system at @xmath68 ) .",
    "similar to the lorenz  system , this system confirms the existence of two different regimes of linear scaling having the s , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "these two examples confirm that for multiple centers of rotation , there are many regimes of linear scaling for which distinct s can be estimated .",
    "in this paper , we use the hurst analysis on 259-year and @xmath1 -year data sets and find multiple s in each time series .",
    "we explain the presence of multiple s in a single time series  using systems from deterministic chaotic dynamics with a single center of rotation ( rssler  and single - scroll chua oscillators ) as well as multiple centers of rotation ( lorenz  and double - scroll chua oscillators ) .",
    "we have shown that in the sunspot data , two distinct linear scaling regimes exist for which two distinct s could be estimated implying a variety of persistent behavior .",
    "the results show very high degree of persistent behavior till 11  years ( @xmath71 ) , a slightly less persistent behavior till 100  years ( @xmath32 ) , and comparatively less persistent behavior till 2300  years ( @xmath72 ) ."
