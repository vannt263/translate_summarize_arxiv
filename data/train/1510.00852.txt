    "to create good time intervals ( gtis ) , i.e. , selecting events from observation periods where flaring is minimal , we started with a statistical approach .",

    "we ran the source detection algorithm separately for each observation . due to the limited memory capabilities of the sas source detection software , not all pseudo - exposures within an observation",

    "each list contains duplicate detections of some sources due to the overlapping regions covered in consecutive source detection runs . to produce a clean x - ray source list for each observation , we removed these duplicate detections . following the algorithm used by the _ xmm - newton _ serendipitous source catalog @xcite to flag duplicate observations",

    "the maximum search radius of 15@xmath39 was chosen as the maximum cut - off distance based on simulations discussed in @xcite , where we found that this radius maximizes identification of output to input sources while minimizing spurious associations of distinct sources ; due to the shallow nature of our observations , source confusion from a high density of resolved sources is not a concern ( see section [ s82x_prop ] for estimated source confusion rate ) . for duplicate detections of the same source , we retain the coordinate , flux , and count information for the object that has the highest detection probability , or @xmath32 .",
    "we perform this routine separately for each energy band , producing one clean source list per band .",
    "we then merge these x - ray source lists for each energy band of an observation using the search criterion defined above to find matches among lists generated in the separate energy bands .",
    "if no match is found , the source is considered undetected in that band and its flux , flux error , counts , and @xmath32 are set to null while we retain this information for the band(s ) where it is detected . while we have discarded sources that are extended in all bands in which they are detected , because the identification of clusters among the extended sources is in progress and",

    "an input source list is then generated by pulling random fluxes from this distribution which are then given random positions among the pseudo - exposures making up the observation .",

    "most of the obscured agn live within the intermediate universe ( @xmath88 ) while galaxies reside in the local universe ( @xmath89 .",
    "we expect the percentage of obscured agn , i.e. , those lacking broad emission lines , to increase as more objects are identified via spectroscopic and photometric redshifts .    in the right - hand panel of figure [ s82x_z_lum_hist ] , we show the observed full - band luminosity distribution of the x - ray agn , 1603 sources in total .",

    "as figure [ comp_lum ] ( left ) shows , as survey area increases and the effective flux limits of the surveys become shallower , the detected sources are preferentially at higher luminosity at every redshift .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure [ comp_lum ] ( right ) , which compares the normalized luminosity distribution of stripe 82x with cosmos and cdfs , highlighting the complementarity of the different survey strategies in preferentially identifying sources within different luminosity ranges ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "wide - area surveys which explore a large volume of the universe , like stripe 82x , are necessary to discover rare objects that have a low space density , including the highest luminosity quasars .",
    "one important caveate in figure [ comp_lum ] is that we limit our comparison to sources with measured redshifts . for stripe 82x , this represents the 30% of the sample that has spectroscopic redshifts while cosmos and cdfs have spectroscopic and photometric redshifts , effectively identifying @xmath1196% and @xmath1191% of the parent samples , respectively .",
    "the photometric redshift catalog for stripe 82x will be published in the coming months ( ananna et al , _ in prep .",

    "we also updated the multi - wavelength matched x - ray catalogs for these earlier segments of the survey . in total , we find reliable multi - wavelength counterparts for 88% of the full stripe 82x survey to date , with a spectroscopic completeness of 30% .",
    "we emphasize that we matched the x - ray source list to each multi - wavelength catalog independently and have not cross - correlated the counterparts .",
    "however the counterparts largely agree among the catalogs , as discussed in the main text .",
    "care must also be taken when studying the colors or spectral energy distributions of the x - ray sources using the magnitudes we present in these catalogs : it is up to the user to decide whether the aperture photometry in these catalogs is most suitable for a given source or if different aperture magnitudes should be retrieved from the main multi - wavelength catalogs , using the identifying information in the stripe 82x catalog to select specific sources .",
    "the large volume of the universe explored by the stripe 82x survey enables the discovery of high - luminosity , high - redshift agn , a missing tier in the current x - ray census of supermassive black hole growth .",
    "we have several upcoming dedicated spectroscopic follow - up programs to increase the completeness of stripe 82x , which in tandem with the photometric redshift catalog ( ananna et al .",
    ", _ in prep .",
    "_ ) , will allow us to constrain how the most luminous x - ray agn evolve over cosmic time .",
    "furthermore , we are targeting obscured agn candidates which have optical and infrared clues that they may be the transitional link in the merger - induced black hole growth / galaxy evolution paradigm ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; a handful of such luminous obscured agn at @xmath86 have already been discovered ( lamassa et al .",
    ", _ in prep .",
    "_ ) , with many more candidates yet to be explored in this dataset",
    ". additionally , stripe 82x will provide insight into agn host galaxies via spectral energy distribution analysis , agn variability , the dark matter halos hosting high - luminosity quasars at high - redshift via clustering analysis , the x - ray properties of galaxy clusters , and the opportunity to discover exotic sources .",
    "for instance , in the previous release of the stripe 82x catalog , we discovered the first `` changing - look '' quasar @xcite , an agn which transitioned from a broad - line ( type 1 ) object to a mostly narrow - line ( type 1.9 ) object within a 10 year period ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we expect that stripe 82x will have applications beyond those listed here , and can be particularly helpful in informing best - effort practices for agn identification and follow - up in upcoming wide - area surveys , including _",
    "erosita _ which will be launched in 2017 @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that increasing the x - ray area to 100 deg@xmath0 will open a new window into black hole growth at @xmath101 and luminosities greater than 10@xmath102 erg s@xmath4 , which is only beginning to be explored from an x - ray perspective ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , nulling out any fluxes which were below this significance threshold ; we refer the user to the _ chandra _ source catalog @xcite for flux measurements at lower significance .",
    "the `` removed_logn_logs '' flags have been updated in both catalogs to indicate which sources were excluded from the log@xmath40-log@xmath41 generation in this work .",
