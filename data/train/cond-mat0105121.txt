    "during the past years , systems which exhibit self  organized criticality ( soc ) have attracted much attention , since they might explain part of the abundance of fractal structures in nature @xcite .",
    "their common features are slow driving or energy input and rare dissipation events which are instantaneous on the time scale of driving . in the stationary state ,",
    "the size distribution of dissipation events obeys a power law , irrespective of initial conditions and without the need to fine - tune parameters .",
    "examples for such systems are the sandpile model @xcite , the self - organized critical forest - fire model ( ffm ) @xcite , the earthquake model by olami , feder , and christensen @xcite , and the bak - sneppen model @xcite .",
    "the study of soc models is usually based on the assumption that the size distribution @xmath0 of dissipation events ( avalanches , fires , earthquakes ) shows the scaling behavior familiar from equilibrium critical systems , @xmath1 with a cutoff function @xmath2 that is constant for small arguments and decays exponentially fast when the argument is considerably larger than 1 .",
    "the cutoff cluster size @xmath3 is related to the correlation length @xmath4 via @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the fractal dimension of the dissipation events .",
    "( if the cutoff is set by the system size @xmath7 , @xmath4 must be replaced with @xmath7 . )",
    "this holds indeed for some self organized critical systems , like the bak - sneppen model , but it has been known for some time that it does not hold for the two - dimensional abelian sandpile model @xcite .",
    "very recent work has shown that this violation of simple scaling in the sandpile model is due to the existence of multiple waves of topplings , and some features of the correct scaling behavior have been worked out @xcite .",
    "violation of finite - size scaling is also seen in the above - mentioned earthquake model @xcite .    during recent years",
    ", evidence has accumulated that the two - dimensional soc forest - fire model does not show simple scaling either .",
    "instead , there are more than one diverging length scale @xcite , the behavior of the model for tree densities just above the critical density is completely different from that of conventional critical systems @xcite , and finite - size scaling is violated @xcite . a scaling collapse based on eq .",
    "( [ eq_scaling ] ) gives a good overlap of the tails of the distribution , but not so much of the first part , where the slope ( i.e. , the exponent @xmath8 ) seems to increase slightly with increasing correlation length ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and figure  [ fig_original_ffm_ns_superpos_and_tendency ] below ) .",
    "we have suggested @xcite that all these features are due to the fact that there are two qualitatively different types of fires in the system : smaller , fractal fires that occur in regions of low tree density and burn a tree cluster that resembles a percolation cluster , and larger compact fires that burn a patch of a tree density above the percolation threshold .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show how these two types of fires add up to give the distributions typically seen in computer simulations , and to derive the asymptotic properties of the fire size distribution in the limit of very large correlation length . in particular",
    ", we will derive the asymptotic value of the exponent of the fire size distribution , toward which it should converge for sufficiently large correlation length .",
    "we support our arguments by three different types of evidence that all lead to the same conclusions : ( i ) scaling arguments based on the superposition of the mentioned two types of fires ; ( ii ) the fire size distributions resulting from the ( artificial ) superposition of the fires of patches of different tree density and different size ; ( iii ) computer simulations of a coarse - grained model that allow us to study numerically systems with much larger correlation length than has been possible so far .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we will derive scaling laws and analytical expressions for the fire size distribution resulting from the assumption that the forest - fire model is composed of patches of different size and different tree densities .",
    "then , in section  [ chap_superpose ] we will show numerical data that result from the superposition of fires from artificially generated patches of different sizes and densities . in section  [ chap_fleckmodell ] , we will present and study a coarse - grained forest - fire model where each lattice site stands for a group of several sites in the original model .",
    "finally , we will discuss our findings .",
    "the soc forest - fire model is usually studied on a square lattice with @xmath9 sites .",
    "each site is either occupied by a tree , or it is empty . at each time step , all sites are updated in parallel according to the following rules : ( i ) an empty sites becomes occupied by a tree with probability @xmath10 ; ( ii ) a tree is struck by lightning with probability @xmath11 . this tree and the whole cluster of trees connected to it ( by nearest - neighbor coupling ) burn down and become empty sites .",
    "as long as @xmath10 and @xmath11 are so small that fires do not interfere with each other or with tree growth , the stationary behavior of the model depends only on the ratio @xmath12 , but not on the two parameters separately . after some time , the system reaches a stationary state with a mean tree density @xmath13 and a mean fire size @xmath14 .",
    "a snapshot of the @xmath15d system in the stationary state is shown in figure  [ fig_snapshot ] .",
    "one can see that it consists of patches of different tree density and different sizes . some of the patches have a high tree density , and if they are struck by lightning , the entire patch burns down , with only few trees being left . after the fire , the tree density @xmath16 of the patch grows again according to @xmath17 until it is hit by the next lightning stroke .",
    "this mechanism of growth and burning down of forest clusters produces the patchy structure seen in figure  [ fig_snapshot ] , which is characterized by the following properties .    *",
    "the patches are almost homogenously covered with trees .",
    "this is because a fire that burns a patch usually leaves only a few trees behind .",
    "( we found that the local tree density within a patch immediately after a fire is typically @xmath18 for the @xmath15d square lattice and @xmath19 for the @xmath15d triangular lattice ) .",
    "thus the random tree growth leads to a uniform tree density within the patch .",
    "the size distribution of tree clusters within a patch is therefore similar to the size distribution of clusters in a percolation system of the same density .",
    "( for an introduction to percolation theory , see @xcite . )",
    "the fact that several patches contain larger dense tree clusters indicates that some fires leave behind small clusters that can become seeds of new patches .",
    "this process of birth and death of patches , which happens on a slower time scale , does not affect our main argument .",
    "* it can be assumed that the distribution of patch sizes is independent of their tree density , because a fire in most cases hardly changes the size of a patch .",
    "thus , the size of most patches is the same for high and low tree density .",
    "* some patches have a tree density above the percolation threshold .",
    "these patches contain a spanning cluster that is compact , i.e. , has the fractal dimension 2 .",
    "when such a patch is struck by lightning , a compact fire occurs that burns the spanning cluster .",
    "if lightning strikes a patch of low tree density ( below the percolation threshold ) , only a small , fractal cluster of trees burns down , and only part of the patch is affected by the fire . if the mean fire size is large ( i.e.  if @xmath12 is small ) , most trees burn down during large fires , and most of the empty sites are created during the large compact fires , resulting in the above - mentioned low local tree density immediately after a fire . *",
    "the size of the largest patch diverges for @xmath20 , suggesting that the system is close to a critical point and can be characterized by power laws .",
    "several such power laws will be mentioned further below .",
    "the two mentioned types of fires add up to give the distributions typically seen in computer simulations , and explain the unconventional behavior of the forest fire model mentioned in the previous section .",
    "the left part of the fire size distribution of the forest fire model ( see figure  [ fig_original_ffm_ns_superpos_and_tendency]b ) is mainly due to fires burning fractal percolation clusters , and the cutoff part is due to large compact fires .",
    "in contrast , in conventional critical systems the power - law part and the cutoff part are due to the same type of critical fluctuations .",
    "since the two parts of the distribution become clearly separated only for very large @xmath4 , as we will show below , the asymptotic exponent of the fire - size distribution is not visible in present - day computer simulations .      in the stationary state",
    ", the mean number of growing trees must equal the mean number of trees burning down , leading to @xcite @xmath21 @xmath14 diverges according to a power law in the limit @xmath20 , implying that the size @xmath3 of the largest fires also diverges , and with it the correlation length @xmath4 , which we define to be the radius of the largest fires .",
    "the cutoff fire size @xmath3 can be expected to scale as @xmath22 with an exponent @xmath23 @xcite , which has a value close to 1.1 .",
    "this leads to @xmath24 since the fractal dimension of the large fires is @xmath15 .",
    "( in contrast , earlier work was based on the assumption that large and small fires have the same fractal dimension , which was found to be @xmath25 @xcite , with some authors not ruling out the value @xmath26 @xcite . )",
    "let @xmath27 be the number of trees burnt during a fire , and @xmath0 the size distribution of fires in the system , normalized such that @xmath28 .",
    "since each tree is struck by lightning with the same probability , the size distribution of tree clusters is proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "we write @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the contribution from the smaller , fractal fires , and @xmath32 being the contribution from the compact fires that burn an entire patch . if there was no qualitative difference between the two types of fires , the scaling law eq .",
    "( [ eq_scaling ] ) would hold , from which one could derive the scaling relation @xmath33 ( this is obtained from the condition @xmath34 and is given in many earlier publications . ) however , since we have two different types of fires , we can not expect this relation to hold .",
    "figure  [ fig_original_ffm_ns_superpos_and_tendency]b shows the size distribution of fires for different values of @xmath12 .",
    "( the system size @xmath7 was chosen large enough to avoid finite - size effects . )",
    "one can see that @xmath0 becomes steeper with decreasing @xmath12 , and one can expect the slope to grow further until it reaches some limit value .",
    "the steepest slope occurring in this figure has the absolute value @xmath35 , which must be a lower bound to the asymptotic value of @xmath8 .",
    "( the value @xmath36 given in many earlier publications was obtained by taking some average value along @xmath0 , which was less than its steepest slope . ) a scaling collapse ( see figure  [ fig_original_ffm_ns_superpos_and_tendency]a ) shows that the cutoff parts of the curves superimpose nicely , allowing to derive a value @xmath37 , which does not fit together with the scaling relation eq .",
    "( [ eq_lambdatau_skalenrelation ] ) . the same result for @xmath23",
    "was obtained by pastor - satorras and vespignani @xcite using a moment analysis , confirming that the cutoff shows simple scaling behavior .",
    "next , let us discuss the properties of @xmath31 .",
    "as @xmath12 decreases , the first part of @xmath0 does not change any more .",
    "this indicates that @xmath31 reaches an asymptotic form @xmath38 as @xmath20 , with a cutoff that depends on @xmath12 .",
    "we therefore write @xmath39 introducing the cutoff function @xmath40 for the distribution of the fractal fires and assuming that the maximum fractal fire size @xmath41 scales with an exponent @xmath42 . for sufficiently large @xmath27",
    ", @xmath38 will reach an asymptotic power law with the `` true '' exponent @xmath8 .",
    "we can estimate the value of @xmath8 from the following argument : the large fractal fires stem from the percolation clusters in those patches that have a tree density close to the percolation threshold @xmath43 .",
    "thus the probability density of finding a cluster of size @xmath27 is proportional to the probability that @xmath44 of a large patch is large enough that percolation clusters of size @xmath27 exist , multiplied by the probability density to find a cluster of size @xmath27 in a system at the percolation threshold .",
    "the fire size distribution is proportional to @xmath27 times the cluster distribution , as we mentioned above .",
    "the probability to find a cluster of size @xmath27 in a percolation system is determined by the size distribution of percolation clusters : @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite . in these patches close to the percolation threshold ,",
    "the tree density increases with time approximately as @xmath49 . therefore , the probability that the density is within a distance @xmath50 of the percolation threshold is proportional to @xmath51 , and the probability that a patch has tree clusters larger than @xmath27 is proportional to @xmath52 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq_sigma_perc_def ] ) ) .",
    "the probability that a fire of size @xmath27 occurs is consequently proportional to @xmath53 this means @xmath54    next , let us estimate the cutoff exponent @xmath42 . as we have seen above",
    ", the radius @xmath4 of the largest patches is proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "the size of the largest fractal tree clusters is therefore proportional to @xmath56 , with the fractal dimension @xmath57 of percolation clusters @xmath58 , implying @xmath59 . beyond the cutoff size for fractal clusters , proportional to @xmath60",
    ", the size distribution of fires must be dominated by the compact fires and therefore by the size distribution of patches . since @xmath61 ,",
    "the `` bump '' ( which is dominated by the compact fires ) should span a larger fraction of the fire size distribution for smaller @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ fig_original_ffm_ns_superpos_and_tendency]b shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "assuming that the patch size distribution @xmath62 scales , too , we suggest a scaling form @xmath63 with @xmath27 being the number of sites in a patch , and @xmath64 being the area of the largest patch .",
    "since most of the system is covered by large patches , @xmath65 must be smaller than 2 , requiring the factor @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_patchdistribution ] ) in order to normalize @xmath67 .",
    "the size distribution @xmath32 for the compact clusters depends on @xmath62 , but the relation between the two is non trivial .",
    "the reason is the following : assume that a patch is struck by lightning always when its density is so far above the percolation threshold that it burns down completely .",
    "in this case , the size distribution of the large fires would be proportional to @xmath27 times the size distribution of the patches .",
    "however , in this case patches would never be destroyed . on the other hand ,",
    "patches merge from time to time with neighbors , when the neighbor reaches a density above the percolation threshold before lightning strikes the patch with the higher density . in order to obtain a stationary patch size distribution , patches",
    "must therefore be destroyed from time to time .",
    "this can only happen if they are hit by lightning with a non vanishing probability as long as their density is sufficiently close to the percolation threshold , such that smaller dense clusters of trees are left behind by the fire that can develop into small new patches .",
    "for this reason the size distribution of the large fires is different from @xmath27 times the size distribution of patches .",
    "this will be seen also in the next section .      additional support for the picture that the fire size distribution is the sum of two qualitatively different contributions comes from the scaling behavior of the tree density .",
    "it has been known for a long time that the tree density approaches its critical value according to @xmath69 with @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "( the most recent and probably most accurate value is 0.47 @xcite . ) if the fire size distribution obeyed the scaling law eq .",
    "( [ eq_scaling ] ) , one would expect @xmath68 to follow from @xmath71 assuming that conventional scaling ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq_scaling ] ) ) holds and using eq .",
    "( [ eq_smax_lambda_scaling_formel ] ) and  ( [ eq_lambdatau_skalenrelation ] ) this leads to @xmath72 with the apparent value of @xmath8 around 1.14 , this would result in a value of @xmath73 much smaller than 0.47 . with the asymptotic value @xmath74 ( see below ) , @xmath73 would have to be much larger than 0.47 .",
    "it has been pointed out recently that the observed value of @xmath68 makes corrections to simple scaling necessary @xcite , and a second contribution to @xmath0 has been suggested , which has a larger exponent @xmath8 but the same cutoff as the main contribution , and which becomes negligible for sufficiently small @xmath12 and sufficiently large @xmath27 .",
    "in contrast to these authors , we argue that there occur not merely corrections to scaling , but that the scaling behavior of the soc forest - fire model is fundamentally different from simple scaling . for this reason , there is no relation between the exponents @xmath68 and @xmath8 , since there is no single exponent @xmath8 describing the entire fire size distribution .",
    "whether there exists another relation between @xmath68 and the fire size distributions @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we do not know .",
    "in order to show that the fire size distribution seen in simulations can be indeed the result of the superposition of the two mentioned types of fires , and in order to confirm that the asymptotic value of @xmath8 is 1.45 , we superimposed the cluster size distributions of 2-dimensional lattices that were homogenously covered with trees , and that had tree densities between @xmath77 and @xmath78 , with weights derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq_tree_growth ] ) .",
    "this kind of superposition was sugested by s. clar in  @xcite .",
    "the values for @xmath79 and @xmath80 were measured for instance in  @xcite .",
    "but in addition to the superposition of the different tree densities we also superimposed different lattice sizes @xmath81 , distributed according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_patchdistribution ] ) with @xmath82 and cutoff @xmath83 .",
    "the lattices thus represent patches of different sizes and densities . in order to find the value of the exponent @xmath65 , we performed superpositions for 20 different values of @xmath65 from 0.1 to 2 .",
    "the results did not depend very much on @xmath65 as long as @xmath65 was smaller than @xmath84 , suggesting that the value of @xmath65 is in the interval ( 0,1 ) , but not allowing us to fix it more precisely .",
    "the results are only reproducible when the statistics are sufficiently good . for this reason , we had to superimpose @xmath85 or more systems .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig_xi_50_and_2000_superposition]a and figure  [ fig_xi_50_and_2000_superposition]b .",
    "please note that these figures give cluster size distributions @xmath29 and not fire size distributions @xmath0 , i.e. , the exponents are larger by 1 . figure  [ fig_xi_50_and_2000_superposition]a shows that the apparent exponent @xmath86 typically found in simulations of the @xmath15d forest fire model is reproduced by the superposition .",
    "the smaller slope for small @xmath27 , and the bump followed by the cutoff , are reproduced as well .",
    "we have performed this superposition also for a triangular lattice .",
    "this lattice is most easily implemented by taking a square lattice and including next - nearest neighbor couplings along one of the diagonals in each unit cell . as for the square lattice , the range of tree densities was obtained from simulations of the soc model , and was found to cover the interval [ 0.062,0.534 ] .",
    "one can see that the apparent exponent @xmath8 is the same as for the square lattice , explaining the `` universality '' of this exponent with respect to a change of the lattice type found earlier @xcite .",
    "( all other figures shown in this paper are for the square lattice only . )",
    "figure  [ fig_xi_50_and_2000_superposition]b shows that the distributions of the two cluster types separate for larger correlation length @xmath4 , and that the slope of the part of the curve that stems from fractal clusters tends to @xmath87 as we calculated in section  [ chap_scaling_laws ] .",
    "a similar effect will be found in the coarse - grained model discussed in the next section ( compare figure  [ fig_coarse_grained_n_s_comparison_slopes_and_collapse]a ) .",
    "our results show also that the size distribution of the largest fires is related to the size distribution of patches in a nontrivial way , as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "if all large fires did burn complete patches , the bump of the fire size distribution would have a slope @xmath88 , which is positive .",
    "since this is not the case , many tree clusters must be contributing to @xmath0 that are large but do not cover the entire patch .",
    "this consideration should hold for any value of @xmath89 .",
    "we expect therefore the value of @xmath80 to decrease slightly with increasing @xmath89 , such that there is always a non vanishing contribution to @xmath0 of clusters that are large but do not cover the entire patch .",
    "we conclude that the superposition of homogeneous patches reproduces important features of the soc ffm .",
    "it is also an efficient way of studying the regime of large correlation length , which is not accessible to direct computer simulations .",
    "in order to be able to study larger systems , we introduced a coarse - grained model where each site stands for a group of sites in the original model .",
    "the variable at each site of this coarse - grained model is the local tree density @xmath90 , ranging continuously from 0 to 1",
    ". the rules of our coarse - grained model are the following : ( i ) the density at all sites increases per time step by a small amount @xmath91 ; ( ii ) lightning strikes each site with a probability @xmath11 .",
    "if the density of this site is below the percolation threshold @xmath92 , nothing happens .",
    "if the tree density on a site struck by lightning is above the percolation threshold @xmath93 , this site and the entire cluster of sites above the percolation threshold connected to it burn down . the density on a site after a fire is a random number between 0 and @xmath94 .",
    "the parameter @xmath94 takes short - range fluctuations in the density into account .",
    "the smaller @xmath94 , the smaller the density fluctuations .",
    "smaller @xmath94 means consequently that the density at each site is the average of a larger number of sites in the original model .",
    "we therefore expect the coarse - grained model for small @xmath94 to resemble the original ffm for large @xmath4 .",
    "although the coarse - grained model is not exactly the same as the original ffm , it shares many of its features .",
    "figure  [ fig_snapshot_effective_model ] shows a snapshot of the coarse - grained model for @xmath95 .",
    "the figure shows a patchy structure similar to the one in figure  [ fig_snapshot ] . in many patches",
    "one can see sites of two different densities .",
    "this indicates that lightning often strikes a patch before all of its sites ( which cover a range of densities of the width @xmath94 ) have a local density above the percolation threshold , leaving behind some sites with a density just below the percolation threshold .",
    "if this happens several times within the same patch , one can expect the patch to be destroyed and replaced by a set of smaller patches .",
    "such processes of birth and death of patches are not considered further in this paper , but of course they occur also in the original ffm , as can be seen in figure  [ fig_snapshot ] . as we have mentioned above , creation of new small patches must occur in order to balance merging and growth of patches in the stationary state .",
    "next , let us consider the size distribution of fires in the coarse - grained model .",
    "figure  [ fig_coarse_grained_n_s_comparison_slopes_and_collapse]a shows our simulation results for @xmath95 and different values of @xmath12 .",
    "one can clearly see that the slope becomes steeper with decreasing @xmath12 and appears to approach a limit slope .",
    "figure  [ fig_coarse_grained_n_s_comparison_slopes_and_collapse]b shows the slopes @xmath96 as function of @xmath27 , indicating that the predicted limit value 1.45 is indeed correct .    figure  [ fig_coarse_grained_n_s_comparison_slopes_and_collapse]c shows a collapse of the cutoff parts of the curves , giving @xmath97 , just as in the original forest - fire model .",
    "we also performed a moment analysis of the fire - size distribution , giving the same result @xmath98 .",
    "figure  [ fig_r_tendency ] shows the fire size distribution @xmath0 for three different values of @xmath94 , and for the same @xmath99 . for smaller @xmath94 ,",
    "the slope becomes steeper and the cutoff bump becomes more pronounced , indicating that for smaller @xmath94 the coarse - grained model resembles the original model on larger scales . for smaller @xmath94 ,",
    "the cutoff becomes larger .",
    "the reason is that for smaller @xmath94 a site of the coarse - grained model corresponds to more sites of the original model .",
    "the same lightning probability @xmath11 per site in the coarse - grained model corresponds to a smaller lightning probability in the original model when @xmath94 is smaller .",
    "let us now estimate how many sites @xmath100 of the original model correspond to a site in the coarse - grained model with parameter @xmath94 . from figure  [ fig_original_ffm_ns_superpos_and_tendency]a we find that @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "similarly , we have for the coarse - grained model @xmath103 from figure  [ fig_coarse_grained_n_s_comparison_slopes_and_collapse]c we estimate @xmath104 , and from the data shown in figure  [ fig_r_tendency ] we then obtain @xmath105 and @xmath106 . now , @xmath89 sites in the coarse - grained model correspond to @xmath107 sites in the original model , and @xmath11 in the coarse - grained model corresponds to a lightning probability @xmath108 per site in the original model",
    ". therefore we have @xmath109 leading to @xmath110 resulting in @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "the length scales of the coarse - grained model are reduced by factors of the order 7 , 50 , and 400 for these three @xmath94 values , compared to the original model .",
    "a direct comparison of a fire size distribution of the original model and one of the coarse - grained model with @xmath114 confirms these findings .",
    "we searched for two fire size distributions such that the ratios of their @xmath11 values and the ratios of their @xmath89 values are similar .",
    "this ratio turned out to be around 45 , as shown in figure  [ fig_coarse_grained_n_s_comparison_with_non_coarse_grained ] , and in agreement with the finding of the previous paragraph .",
    "figure  [ fig_coarse_grained_n_s_comparison_with_non_coarse_grained ] , shows also that the shapes of the two fire - size distributions , while similar , are not identical .",
    "identical shapes can not be expected , since the coarse - grained model is not completely identical to the original model on larger scales .",
    "for instance , inhomogeneities arising in the original model within an area of size @xmath100 , can not occur in the coarse - grained model .",
    "this explains the difference in shape on small scales . on large scales , the difference in the shape of the cutoff is probably due to the fact that the process of slow destruction of large patches is slightly different in the two models . in both cases , lightning strokes hitting the patch when its density is only slightly above the percolation threshold make the patch more inhomogeneous . in the coarse - grained model ,",
    "this leads to sites belonging to two widely different density intervals , as mentioned further above in the context of figure  [ fig_snapshot_effective_model ] . in the original model ,",
    "this leads to a couple of smaller dense tree clusters being left behind by the fire , as can be concluded from figure  [ fig_snapshot ] .    to conclude this section , our coarse - grained model , while not being exactly equivalent to the original model , shows the features expected for the original model on larger scales and confirms in particular the universality of the exponent @xmath23 and our conjecture that the exponent @xmath8 has an asymptotic value around 1.45 .",
    "the detailed mechanism of birth and destruction of patches is somewhat different in the two models and leads to different shapes of the fire size distributions at small @xmath27 and for the largest @xmath27 .",
    "in this paper , we have argued that the fire size distribution in the soc ffm is the result of the superposition of two types of fires .",
    "the smaller ones are fractal percolation clusters , while the larger fires are compact and burn down a patch of a tree density above the percolation threshold .",
    "we supported this picture by a direct analysis of the model , by the artificial superposition of the two types of fires , and by the introduction of a coarse - grained ffm .",
    "one of our main results is that the asymptotic exponent for the fire size distribution is @xmath115 , and is visible only at length scales not accessible to present - day computer simulations . for values of the correlation length",
    "typically seen in computer simulations , the exponent @xmath8 has an apparent value which is smaller , and which seems to be insensitive to the lattice type used in the simulations .",
    "furthermore , we found that the cutoff exponent @xmath23 has an universal value @xmath98 , which is measured in the original ffm as well as in the coarse - grained ffm for different simulation parameters .",
    "the robustness of this exponent is additionally supported by our earlier finding that the correlation length shows nice scaling behavior in a generalized model where trees can be immune to fire @xcite .",
    "we could not find the precise form of the size distribution of patches , although we presented evidence that it should be characterized by an exponent @xmath65 smaller than 1 .",
    "the patch size distribution is the result of a slow and highly nontrivial process of birth and merging and destruction of patches .",
    "this process also determines the size distribution of the large fires , for which we could not give an analytical expression .",
    "in contrast to the exponent @xmath8 , we could not derive the value of the exponent @xmath23 from analytical arguments .",
    "we can not rule out that its true value is @xmath116 , and that there are logarithmic corrections which make it appear slightly larger than 1 .",
    "as we have shown , several scaling relations familiar from conventional critical systems and in particular from percolation theory do not hold in the soc ffm . instead , the ffm is a new type of non equilibrium critical system that has no equivalent in equilibrium physics .",
    "it is characterized by different phenomena on different scales , and by a patchy structure indicating that neighboring sites tend to be synchronized by burning down during the same large fires .    by introducing the coarse - grained model ,",
    "we have shown that there exists an entire class of models that share the same main features of a patchy structure and two qualitatively different types of fires , the asymptotic exponent @xmath115 , and the cutoff exponent @xmath117 , while details like the precise shape of the cutoff and the precise mechanism of birth and destruction of patches may differ .",
    "our results show that soc in dissipative systems can be caused by mechanisms fundamentally different from equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "we expect that other dissipative soc systems are driven to criticality by mechanisms similar to the ones found in the ffm .",
    "this applies in particular to the soc earthquake model @xcite , where a patchy structure with partial synchronization of neighboring sites was also found @xcite .",
    "very recently , it was also found that this model contains two qualitatively different types of avalanches : those within a `` patch '' , and those that enter it from outside and span the entire `` patch '' @xcite .",
