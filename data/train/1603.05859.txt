    "our life is full of cause - and - effect relationships , such that past events influence the future occurrence of events .",
    "the proliferation process has been studied using both macroscopic models , such as the epidemic model  @xcite , and microscopic models , such as the self - exciting point process proposed by hawkes  @xcite .",
    "these models have been applied to analyze not only the communication of diseases  @xcite but also urban crime  @xcite , human activity  @xcite , economics  @xcite , genome sequences  @xcite , and neuronal firing  @xcite . a key quantity representing",
    "the interaction in these various phenomena is the basic reproduction ratio , which is defined as the average number of additional events induced by a single event  @xcite . in epidemics ,",
    "a disease becomes a pandemic in a homogeneous network if the reproduction ratio is greater than unity , as in a nuclear chain reaction  @xcite , and vanishes otherwise .",
    "nevertheless , the event - occurrence does not cease if individuals are stimulated in external communities or exhibit spontaneous activity . in such situations ,",
    "the system may still exhibit cascades of event - occurrences intermittently , even if the reproduction ratio is smaller than the epidemic threshold , as in tweets  @xcite and neuronal firings _ in vivo _  @xcite .",
    "the nonstationary fluctuations may be terminated by reducing the reproduction ratio further  @xcite .",
    "event cascades can be a nuisance in some contexts , such as when the peak - demand causes vaccine shortages  @xcite or heavy traffic on communication lines  @xcite , but may be beneficial in other contexts ; for example , spontaneous activity in neural networks may be used to generate motion or store memory  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to comprehend the mechanism by which such cascades appear .",
    "we show that such a transition between stationary and nonstationary states generally occurs in every proliferation system , obtain the condition on which cascades may emerge in a given network , and suggest a systematic method for controlling systems to oppress or promote the event - occurrence bursts .",
    "although the epidemic model and the hawkes process appear to differ from one another , they have something in common because both were constructed to describe the proliferation processes . to identify their common features",
    ", we first revise them by considering realistic constraints .",
    "for an epidemic model , we consider the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model describing the situation in which infected individuals may recover without immunity : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the fractions of infected and susceptible individuals , respectively ( @xmath3 ) ; @xmath4 is the rate at which susceptible individuals are infected by contacting infected individuals ; and @xmath5 is the rate at which infected individuals recover and regain susceptibility . the infected individuals asymptotically vanish if the reproduction ratio @xmath6 is smaller than or equal to unity ; otherwise , the fraction is finite : @xmath7 . to consider extrinsic or spontaneous activation",
    ", we suggest revising the sis model by adding an inflow to the infected population from the susceptible one : @xmath8        in the presence of spontaneous activity @xmath9 , the asymptotic fraction of infected individuals remains positive and smoothly increases with @xmath10 , and , accordingly , the epidemic transition at @xmath11 is softened ( fig .",
    "[ f1](a ) ) .",
    "the hawkes process considers spontaneous occurrences in terms of the positive base rate @xmath12 and describes the manner in which the event - occurrence rate @xmath13 is modulated by past events : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the occurrence time of the @xmath16th event .",
    "the history kernel @xmath17 satisfies the causality , @xmath18 for @xmath19 , and the normalization , @xmath20 . by taking the ensemble average ,",
    "the average rate of event - occurrence is obtained as @xmath21 .",
    "the divergence at @xmath22 arises from instantaneous reactivation , which is an artifact caused by the simplicity of the linear model , which ignores the refractory period during which each individual does not recover susceptibility . here",
    ", we suggest revising the model by introducing the effect of a refractory period @xmath23 : @xmath24 by taking an ensemble average and approximating @xmath25 with @xmath26 , we obtain the average rate of event - occurrences as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the asymptotic fraction obtained for the revised sis model ( fig .",
    "[ f1](b ) ) .",
    "thus , the epidemic model and the hawkes process may represent the identical mean occurrence rate by taking the spontaneous activation and the refractory periods into account .",
    "although the systems no longer exhibit a clear transition at @xmath11 causing the catastrophic chain reaction , they may still show nonstationary fluctuations with intermittent cascades of event - occurrences at lower reproduction ratios ; when the reproduction ratio is even smaller , they may remain stationary , producing apparently random events over time .",
    "the sis model that addresses the mean population dynamics can not represent fluctuations in the event - occurrences . here ,",
    "we construct and simulate a markov process of microscopic dynamics in which individuals become infected and recover to be susceptible ( fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) ) . in every interval of a small time - step @xmath29 ,",
    "each susceptible individual in total population n may become infected with a probability @xmath30 , which shifts as @xmath31 .",
    "each infected individual may regain their susceptibility with the probability @xmath32 , which shifts as @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ f2](b ) depicts sample sequences of infected times : at a reproduction ratio of @xmath34 , the occurrence of infection appears random across individuals but stationary in the whole system .",
    "by contrast , at @xmath35 or @xmath36 , the event sequence appears nonstationary , exhibiting spontaneous cascades of occurrences .",
    "indeed , microscopic fluctuation is amplified to be macroscopically visible , whereas the average rate is restrained to be finite .",
    "we suggest deciding whether a given series of events is stationary or nonstationary based on whether proper rate estimators conclude a constant rate or a fluctuating rate , respectively . here , we adopt a method of selecting the histogram bin size to minimize the expected mean square error between the histogram and the unknown underlying rate  @xcite .",
    "note that the decision regarding stationary vs nonstationary state is common across proper rate estimators , such as the empirical bayes and variational bayes hidden markov estimators  @xcite .",
    "histograms were fitted to the data : the optimal bin size @xmath37 was diverging ( becoming as large as the entire observation period ) when @xmath38 , whereas it was finite ( significantly smaller than the entire period ) when @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ f2](c ) depicts the manner in which the inverse bin size @xmath39 varies with the reproduction ratio @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath39 remains near zero if @xmath10 is smaller than approximately @xmath40 , and it departs from zero otherwise , thus exhibiting the stationary - nonstationary ( sn ) transition .",
    "we also simulated the revised hawkes process ( [ hawkes_rev ] ) with parameters identical to those used for the epidemic markov process . here",
    ", events are indicated by repeating the bernoulli trials with a probability of @xmath41 in every small interval of @xmath29 . by plotting @xmath39 versus @xmath10",

    "depicts the critical reproduction ratios obtained for the epidemic markov process and the revised hawkes process plotted against the refractory period @xmath23 , indicating that the sn critical points for both models are robustly close to @xmath42 , which was obtained for the original ( linear ) hawkes process ( @xmath43 ) in our previous study  @xcite .",
    "note that the critical point is independent of the shape of the kernel , as well as the base rate .",
    "finally , we consider the emergence of cascades in a population of individuals interacting through inhomogeneous connections .      to obtain the condition for the sn transition",
    "analytically , we analyze the linear multivariate hawkes processes ( fig .",
    "[ f3](a ) ) .",
    "the rate of event - occurrences in the @xmath1th individual or node ( @xmath44 ) is given as @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents the base rate , @xmath47 is the occurrence time of the @xmath16th event in the @xmath48th node , and @xmath49 represents the interaction from the @xmath48th node to the @xmath1th node . because of the interactions between individuals , @xmath50 , the average rates @xmath51 are shifted from the base rates @xmath52 as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the leontief inverse  @xcite : @xmath55 .",
    "even when the fluctuations are not detectable at any single node , all events occurring in the entire set of nodes may exhibit visible fluctuations because the signal - to - noise ratio may increase when multiple series of events are superposed ( fig .",
    "[ f3](b ) ) . by analyzing equation eq .",
    "( [ mvhawkes ] ) , we obtain the condition required for a series of events occurring in an entire population to be nonstationary ( see appendix [ appendix : a ] ) : @xmath56 where @xmath57 .    here",

    "for the erds - rnyi network , in which a pair of nodes is independently randomly linked at a fraction of @xmath60 , the sn critical point remains near @xmath40 for a wide range of @xmath60 .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to shift @xmath64 by reallocating the connections between individuals ; exchanging connections @xmath49 and @xmath65 may alter @xmath64 by @xmath66 where @xmath67 . to raise or lower @xmath64 , we repeat exchanging a pair of connections that maximizes or minimizes @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "[ f4](a ) ) .",

    "( [ dc ] ) .",
    "when @xmath71 , @xmath64 remains below 2 , even when all connections are reallocated ; however , when @xmath72 , @xmath64 exceeds 2 , indicating that the system may change between nonstationary ( @xmath73 ) and stationary ( @xmath74 ) .      in the study of epidemics ,",
    "whether the epidemic threshold is higher in the clustered networks  @xcite or not  @xcite has been controversial . here",
    ", we are not addressing the epidemic transition , but we are interested in how the clustering of individuals influences the s - n transition .",
    "figure  [ f4](c ) depicts the manner in which the average clustering coefficient changes with our gradient ascent or descent of @xmath64 , indicating that clustering tends to facilitate the event - occurrence cascades .",
    "a similar tendency was reported in neural network simulations  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of our method is that we can control the cascade bursting activity by systematically rearranging connections based on a single measure : @xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ f4](d ) depicts the range of @xmath69 in which a network may exhibit stationary and nonstationary states . in the `` stationary '' regime ,",
    "the systems never generate visible cascades , even when connections are reallocated , whereas in the `` nonstationary '' regime , the systems always exhibit cascades . in the `` s - n 0 '' regime , networks may be either stationary or nonstationary , depending on the manner in which individuals are connected . in the `` s - n 1 '' regime",
    ", networks may be either stationary or nonstationary if the reciprocal connections can be controlled independently , whereas undirected networks , whose connections are reciprocally symmetric @xmath75 , remain nonstationary , always generating cascades of events . for undirected networks , the critical point @xmath10 appears to be bounded at approximately @xmath40 .    as extreme configurations with low critical points in @xmath10 , we considered networks of ( i ) : the nodes of one group are fully connected within the group , and the others are isolated ; and ( ii ) : the nodes of one group are fully connected within the group and also receive undirected ( reciprocal ) connections from all nodes of another group .",
    "the critical points of @xmath10 exhibit crossover at @xmath76 , and above and below this point , those of ( i ) and ( ii ) are lower .",
    "the criticality in low @xmath10 implies that these configurations tend to facilitate cascade bursting . as an opposite extreme",
    ", we considered another configuration ( iii ) : each node of one group receives only directed connections from another group .",
    "we also considered a specific hierarchical networks of ( iv ) : every node exerts the influence over the lower hierarchy nodes in a manner that connections form a triangular matrix .",
    "all critical points for these specific cases are obtained analytically ( see appendix [ appendix : b ] ) and plotted in fig .",
    "[ f4](d ) : the configurations ( i ) and ( ii ) tend to incite bursting , whereas the configurations ( iii ) and ( iv ) impede bursting .",
    "these observations imply that networks in which small number of individuals occupy reciprocal connections favor event cascade bursting , whereas directed unilateral connections tend to impede cascades .",
    "finally we demonstrate the manner in which the network is reconnected by our method for inciting or impeding cascades ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) ; we take up the network of `` zachary s karate club ''  @xcite and reallocate the ( undirected ) friendships between 34 people . by assuming that the original network is at the criticality @xmath77 , we reorganized the network so that their entire communications becomes stationary or nonstationary . the operation to impede the communication cascades ( @xmath78 ) tended to make all people be connected harmoniously .",
    "contrariwise , the operation to incite the cascade ( @xmath79 ) made the society polarized into two kinds of people ; a few people have exclusive rich connections , while others are connected only with those people .",
    "here , we showed that the proliferation process may exhibit the sn transition at which nonstationary cascades of event - occurrences emerge from the stationary process .",
    "the critical reproduction ratio for the sn transition is much smaller than the threshold for the conventional epidemic transition exhibiting chain reactions .",
    "the sn transition may depend greatly on the manner in which individuals are connected .",
    "we developed a theory for predicting the occurrence of cascades in a network .",
    "we also suggested a method of reconnecting individuals for impeding or inciting cascade bursting in a network . to set about applying our theory to real - world problems",
    ", we need information regarding interactions . it may be the next challenge to analyze subthreshold dynamics occurring in a variety of proliferation processes and develop methods of estimating interactions between nodes or individuals from their sequences of events .",

    "is supported by a jsps research fellowship for young scientists .",
    "here , we derive the condition for the sn transition for a given series of events . it has been proven that the optimal bin size may be finite",
    "if fluctuation in the underlying rate @xmath80 satisfies the condition  @xcite @xmath81 and diverges otherwise .",
    "this is derived as follows .",
    "the mean square error between the underlying rate @xmath13 and the histogram @xmath82 is given as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the entire observation interval , and the bracket represents the ensemble average over the possible realization of the stochastic process .",
    "in each bin of size @xmath85 , the histogram @xmath86 is a constant whose height is the number of events @xmath87 divided by the bin size @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the mean square error is transformed as @xmath88 the expected number of events in each interval is given by integrating the underlying rate : @xmath89 . because events are independently drawn , the poisson relation holds : @xmath90 . inserting these relations into eq .",
    "( [ mise1 ] ) , we have @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the correlation of the rate fluctuation or @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the temporal fluctuation of the rate .",
    "the mean square error may have a minimum at some finite @xmath85 .",
    "based on the second - order transition in which the minimum position @xmath37 goes to infinity or @xmath39 goes to zero continuously , the condition for the transition is given as @xmath95 this can be summed up as a condition of the rate fluctuation given in inequality ( [ sn ] ) if @xmath96 is finite .",
    "this condition was derived from the optimization of a histogram and was found to be identical to that derived from the marginal likelihood maximization of the bayesian rate estimator , implying that this condition may be a universal bound for detecting rate fluctuation  @xcite .    for the linear self - exciting point process",
    ", the power spectrum of the rate fluctuation or the fourier transformation of the autocorrelation @xmath97 was obtained by hawkes  @xcite .",
    "the result can be summarized as  @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the fourier transform of the kernel function @xmath17 . because @xmath100 , the condition for the linear self - exciting process to be nonstationary is obtained as @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the sn transition occurs at @xmath102 independent of the time course of supplementary probability @xmath17 and the base rate @xmath12 .    the multivariate hawkes process ( [ mvhawkes ] ) is also analytically tractable ;",
    "in particular , the fourier zero - mode of the correlations @xmath103 is obtained as  @xcite , @xmath104 each node may exhibit the sn criticality if the correlation of each individual , @xmath105 , satisfies the sn condition . even when rate fluctuations are not detectable at any single node , the summed activity of multiple nodes may exhibit fluctuation .",
    "the condition for the superposed series to exhibit the sn transition is obtained by applying the nonstationary condition ( [ sn ] ) to the summed rate @xmath62 , thus leading to inequality ( [ conditionall ] ) .",
    "in the following , we give the criticality conditions @xmath77 in eq .",
