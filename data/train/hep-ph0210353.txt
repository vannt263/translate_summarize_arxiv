    "precise measurements of exclusive nonleptonic @xmath1 decays have initiated theoretical considerations which go beyond _ naive factorization _ frequently used in the calculation of decay amplitudes .",
    "nonfactorizable contributions have been investigated in several approaches @xcite for different classes of two - body nonleptonic @xmath1 decays . here , we focus on nonfactorizable corrections in the decay @xmath0 .",
    "this channel is particularly interesting because of a substantial discrepancy between the prediction from naive factorization and experiment by more than a factor of three in the branching ratio .",
    "also , this mode belongs to the color - suppressed class-2 decays for which large nonfactorizable contributions are expected .",
    "the weak matrix element can be written in the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 form factor and the parameter @xmath5 incorporates factorizable and nonfactorizable contributions .",
    "a particular useful parametrization is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the short - distance wilson coefficients .",
    "the first two terms in ( 2 ) result from naive factorization , while the term proportional to @xmath8 represents nonfactorizable contributions .",
    "since @xmath5 parametrizes a physical decay amplitude , the scale dependence of the individual terms in @xmath5 must cancel .",
    "taking @xmath9 , one has , numerically , @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "according to the large @xmath12 analysis @xcite , there could be a cancellation between the last two terms in ( 2 ) , both being of order @xmath13 relative to the leading term . in case of such a cancellation , @xmath14 would be negative .",
    "while for @xmath15 decays a negative value of @xmath5 is consistent with experiment , experimental data on @xmath1 decays suggest a positive @xmath5 . on the other hand , explicit estimates of nonfactorizable contributions in @xmath1 decays have predicted both signs for @xmath5 .    in @xcite , the _ qcd light - cone sum rule method _",
    "@xcite was applied to the calculation of soft nonfactorizable contributions in @xmath0 .",
    "the relevant operators in the weak hamiltonian @xmath16 are @xmath17 it is the contribution of @xmath18 to the matrix element ( 1 ) , which is expected to give rise to the leading nonfactorizable effects .",
    "the sum rule approach allows to estimate the contribution of soft - gluon exchange between the @xmath19 and the @xmath20 system , see fig . 1 .",
    "to this end , one has to isolate the ground state contribution to the correlation function @xmath21 represented graphically in fig.1 . taking into account twist-3 and twist-4 contributions calculated at the appropriate scale @xmath22",
    ", one finds @xmath23 and , substituting ( 5 ) in ( 2 ) , @xmath24 although the nonfactorizable matrix element ( 5 ) is rather small , it increases @xmath5 by @xmath25 , due to the large coefficient @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , one has nonfactorizable contributions from hard - gluon exchange .",
    "they have been estimated in _",
    "qcd factorization _ @xcite and amount to another @xmath27 correction @xcite .",
    "thus , in total one obtains @xmath28",
    "firstly , one can see that the theoretical expectation ( 7 ) is still too small to explain the experimental value @xmath29 secondly , it is interesting to note that the theoretical approach described here predicts a positive sign of @xmath5 in agreement with experiment and in contradiction with the argument based on @xmath13 expansion @xcite . finally , a comparison of the value ( 8) deduced from the measurement of @xmath0 with the result @xmath30 from the decays @xmath31 indicates a substantial nonuniversality of @xmath5 in color - suppressed decays @xcite .",
