    "however , the physical condition of the ism in early galaxies , which is the formation environments of second and later generation of stars , is still very uncertain , in contrast to well - defined pristine environments , where the first stars in the universe are formed .",
    "one of the most conspicuous features of the galactic ism is its multi - phase nature , which is caused by thermal bistability ( field et al .",

    "the success in those numerical studies is quite encouraging as it implies that similar numerical approach to the early - galaxy ism is also viable .",
    "thermal instability is also operative in hot primordial gases with @xmath10k owing to h and he@xmath11 bound - bound emission .",
    "fall & rees ( 1985 ) identified clumps formed by this instability as a proto - globular cluster clouds . in smaller halos with virial temperature @xmath12k , h@xmath0 formation and cooling can trigger thermal instability in the temperature range of 2000 - 7000k ( sabano & yoshii 1977 ; yoshii & sabano 1979 , 1980 ; murray & lin 1989 ; corbelli , galli , & palla 1997 ) . in particular , silk ( 1983 ) pointed out that enhanced cooling by rapid three - body h@xmath0 formation makes a collapsing pre - stellar cloud thermally unstable and triggers its fragmentation around @xmath13 . although this instability appears too weak to cause fragmentation in reality ( abel , bryan & norman 2002 ; omukai & yoshii 2003 ; see also greif , springel , & bromm 2013 ) , it might be relevant to the origin of the two - phase gas around the first protostars found in numerical simulations ( turk , norman & abel 2010 ) . in a population ii star - forming ism with some metal enrichment , thermal instability",

    "so far , however , development of the thermal instability in the low - metallicity medium has never been confirmed by multi - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations and its physical condition has not been studied comprehensively . in this paper , as the first attempt of this sort , we investigate the non - linear growth of thermal stability in the ism with metallicity @xmath15 by way of local three - dimensional simulations . similar to the case of the galactic ism , post - shock regions are likely environments of thermal instability in early galaxies .",
    "shocks are considered to be prevalent in forming galaxies as a result of more frequent merging with other galaxies , inflow of the intergalactic gas , and compression by the supernova explosion after vigorous starbursts .",
    "those post - shock layers are known to contract isobarically until the postshock gas reaches thermal equilibrium ( e.g. , yamada & nishi 1998 , koyama & inutsuka 2000 ) . even without shocks , with metallicity @xmath16 , rapid cooling causes the protogalactic clouds to contract isobarically ( safranek - shrader et al .",
    "thus , here , we study thermal stability in isobarically contracting low - metallicity media .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in  2 , we first examine when the condition for the thermal instability is satisfied in low - metallicity ism and estimate the unstable scales for various metallicities and background ultraviolet field strengths . in  3 , we describe the local three - dimensional simulation of the thermal - instability development in low - metallicity medium . finally in  4",
    ", we summarize our findings and discuss their implications for low - metallicity star formation .",
    "before the full simulations , we explore the density / temperature ranges of thermal instability by applying the instability criterion derived by the linear perturbation theory . here , we take an isobarically contracting gas as the background medium against which we examine the thermal instability .",
    "the evolution of the unperturbed background state is described by the energy equation @xmath17 supplemented with the equation of state : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the specific internal energy , @xmath20 is the mass density , @xmath21 is the thermal pressure , @xmath22 is the adiabatic index , and @xmath23 is net cooling rate per unit volume . using the isobaricity @xmath24 , the above equations can be combined into the following single equation : @xmath25 here , we note again that the isobaric condition assumed for the background state is expected to hold both in the postshock cooling layer and the protogalactic clouds , i.e. , the site of star formation in the first galaxy , until the gas reaches thermal equilibrium state , as long as the cooling timescale is shorter than the compression timescale by external force such as self - gravity . in  2.3 , we show that the isobaricity would break down in the media with @xmath26 .",

    "such a bi - phasic structure results from the fact that dense perturbations grow exponentially with time while the density in the surrounding diffuse medium increases more slowly by the overall contraction .",
    "figure [ f3 ] demonstrates that , even in the lowest - metallicity case studied , @xmath45=-4 $ ] , the ism has a bi - phasic structure consistent with the linear analysis ( see figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "note that although the ambient diffuse gas itself is also cooling and will eventually be incorporated into the dense clumps , such a bi - phasic structure is maintained as long as thermally unstable gases are continuously supplied from the shock front ( see , e.g. , inoue & inutsuka 2012 for a recent simulation ) .",
    "the bi - phasic nature can be observed more quantitatively in the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the density shown in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "the red , green , blue , magenta , and aqua lines , respectively , represent the cases of @xmath45=0 $ ] , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath73 at @xmath135 myr , and the black line shows the initial ( pre - shock ) state .",
    "the bimodal distribution of the post - shock gas ( @xmath143 @xmath8 ) reflects the bi - phasic structure .",
    "because the preshock medium contains seed density inhomogeneities , the richtmyer - meshkov instability ( richtmyer 1960 ) is induced by interactions between the density fluctuations and the shocks , making postshock medium turbulent .",

    "their density snapshots and the density pdf are shown in figures [ f5 ] and [ f6 ] , respectively .",
    "we can see that the bimodal distribution becomes less remarkable as @xmath27 goes down and eventually disappears in the @xmath148 case .",
    "this is because a weak fuv field suppresses the effect of the thermal instability as shown by the linear stability analysis ( middle panel of figure [ f2 ] ) , which indicates that the thermally unstable density range shrinks when @xmath149 .",
    "recalling the e - folding number shown in figure  [ ff2 ] , the vanishing of the bimodal distribution for @xmath150 cases indicates that @xmath151 is necessary for the thermal instability to develop fully , although the detailed threshold @xmath98 would also depend on the amplitude of the initial density fluctuation .",
    "it should be noted that the contrasting result of @xmath72 run ( effective thermal instability ) and @xmath148 run ( ineffective thermal instability ) is reminiscent of the difference of the two converging - flow simulations , one for the thermally bistable ism and the other for ( thermally stable ) polytropic medium studied by audit & hennebelle ( 2010 ) .",
    "although not yet fully understood , the thermally biphasic medium could have some role in maintaining the interstellar turbulence . because the cold clumps are embedded in a higher temperature medium , shock dissipation is expected to be suppressed even if cold clumps move supersonically with respect to their internal sound speed .",
    "here we consider how many numerical cells are necessary to capture the fastest growing mode of the thermal instability .",
    "for this purpose , we perform additional simulations for @xmath45=-3 $ ] and @xmath72 with different cell numbers of @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 . in the top panels of figure  [ f7 ] , we show the resulting density snapshots of these runs at @xmath157 myr .",
    "we also plot the mass weighted pdfs in the bottom panel . at this time",
    ", dense clumps with @xmath158 @xmath8 begin to appear for the case of the high - resolution runs with @xmath159 , and @xmath154 .",
    "however , in the cases of @xmath160 , the dense fragments have not yet formed , indicating that even the fastest growing mode of the thermal instability is suppressed due to numerical diffusion ( vzquez - semadeni et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "according to the results of the linear analysis in  2 , the maximum scale of the thermal instability ( the acoustic scale at @xmath161 k ) is given as @xmath162 pc ( eq [ [ fitac ] ] ) , which is resolved by @xmath163 cells .",
    "thus , the result of the above comparison indicates that , at least we need to resolve @xmath164 with more than 60 cells to follow the fastest condensation mode .",
    "note that , as we have mentioned in  3.2 , the above minimum resolution does not ensure the convergence , since the convergence requires to resolve the field length for capturing smallest fragments ( koyama & inutsuka 2004 ) .",
    "even so , as we will discuss in  4.2 , our criterion ( @xmath165 ) would be useful , because large - scale clumps formed by the fastest growing mode have most of the mass of condensations for realistic seed fluctuations .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the linear stability and nonlinear growth of the thermal instability in isobarically contracting gas with various metallicities and fuv field strengths .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows :    * when the h@xmath0 cooling is suppressed by fuv fields ( @xmath166 ) , the interstellar medium ( ism ) is thermally unstable in the temperature range 100 k @xmath167 7000 k owing to the cooling by [ cii ] 158 @xmath56 m and [ oi ] 63 @xmath56 m fine - structure lines regardless of metallicity . in this case , the ism becomes bi - phasic with a bimodal density distribution ( figure [ f4 ] ) . *",
    "the maximum ( i.e. , the acoustic scale @xmath93 ) and minimum scales ( i.e. , the field length @xmath168 ) of the thermal instability , which are well - fitted by eqs .",
    "( [ fitac ] ) and ( [ fitf ] ) , respectively , become smaller with increasing metallicity .",
    "comparisons of the nonlinear simulations with different resolution indicates that the maximum scale of the thermal instability should be resolved more than 60 cells to follow the fastest growing mode of the thermal instability (  3.4 ) .",
    "* under sufficiently weak fuv fields and with low metallicity , the density range of thermal instability shrinks owing to the dominance of h@xmath0 cooling ( figure [ f2 ] ) .",
    "as the fuv intensity is reduced , bi - phasic structure becomes less remarkable and disappears eventually ( figure [ f6 ] ) .",
    "these results indicate that the effect of the thermal instability is suppressed when the e - folding number is @xmath169 in the case of our initial conditions , which corresponds to the conditions @xmath45\\lesssim -3 $ ] and @xmath170 ( see , figure  [ ff2 ] ) .      according to the recent numerical studies on the first galaxy formation ( safranek - shrader et al .",
    "2014 ) , the gravitational fragmentation scale is set by the jeans mass when the temperature of the isobarically contracting gas reaches the cmb temperature floor . the typical mass scale of such fragments is @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the jeans length and the cmb temperature written in terms of the redshift @xmath173 is used .",
    "safranek - shrader et al .",
    "( 2014 ) regarded this mass scale as the mass scale for stellar clusters in the first galaxy . in their simulation , however , clump formation by thermal instability may not be resolved properly because of their employment of the jeans criterion . in the following ,",
    "we speculate how the thermal - instability - induced fragmentation affects the fate of the ism evolution .",
    "the clump mass function by the thermal instability is known to take the power - law form : @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the power - law index of the three - dimensional power spectrum of the seed density fluctuations ( hennebelle & audit 2007 ; hennebelle & chabrier 2008 ) , which gives @xmath176 for realistic kolmogorov - type fluctuations of @xmath177 .",
    "for this distribution , most of the mass is locked up in large fragments , with 50% of the total mass being in the clumps of @xmath178 .",
    "hence , we regard @xmath179 as the typical mass of the fragments due to the thermal instability . using the acoustic scale @xmath93 ( eq . [ fitac ] ) , the typical mass of the fragments can be written as @xmath180 where we have evaluated the mass scale at @xmath181 k at which @xmath182 takes the maximum .",
    "comparison of @xmath183 with @xmath184 allows us to define the critical metallicity above which the typical clump mass falls below the gravitational fragmentation mass : @xmath185 we here discuss the cases when the thermal instability fully develops although the thermal instability condition depends also on the fuv intensity as seen in  2 and  3 .",
    "if the metallicity is much lower than the critical value ( @xmath186 ) , most of the clumps created by thermal instability are above the gravitational - fragmentation scale , suggesting that the thermal instability that happens prior to the jeans instability could determine the mass scale of the stellar clusters in the first galaxy .",
    "fragmentation by thermal instability would lead to a power - law distribution of the cluster mass spectrum as given by eq .",
    "( [ eqha ] ) with a high - mass cutoff @xmath187 .",
    "note that the fact that the thermal instability grows only for @xmath45\\gtrsim -4 $ ] ( see  2.3 ) indicates that the discussion above is applicable for @xmath188 .",
    "if @xmath189 , on the other hand , most of clumps are much smaller than @xmath184 , which indicates that even when the gravitationally bound objects are formed by dense gas that reaches the cmb temperature , they would be in the form of complex of small - scale clumps , each of which is a gravitationally unbound object .",
    "in addition , the clumpy medium formed by the thermal instability is highly turbulent which would substantially affect the star formation activity ( see , e.g. , inoue & inutsuka 2012 for a recent simulation of such molecular cloud in the present - day ism ) .",
    "thus , the star formation activity in the first galaxy with @xmath189 would be suppressed compared to those with @xmath186 . there could be a transition in star formation from a starburst mode to a more gradual one around this metallicity .",
