    "the theory of low - dimensional metals has exerted a strong influence on our understanding of ordered phases in quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) organic conductors .",
    "the description of the extensively studied bechgaard salts series ( ( tmtsf)@xmath5x ) and their sulfur analogs , the fabre ( ( tmttf)@xmath5x ) salts , has served over more than two decades to illustrate this view.@xcite for these materials , a direct correspondence can be traced between the various modulated spin and charge ordered states of their phase diagram and the possible states of the quasi-1d electron gas model when the couplings are repulsive and the filling of the band is commensurate with the underlying lattice.@xcite in its standard form , this generic model is defined by the phenomenological expression of the direct interaction between electrons in terms of weak _ _ intra__chain backward ( @xmath6 ) and forward ( @xmath7 ) electron - electron scattering processes , to which umklapp ( @xmath8 ) scattering amplitudes are added at commensurate band filling.@xcite the quasi-1d character of the model is defined by adding an interchain single electron hopping integral @xmath9 , which is at least an order of magnitude smaller than its longitudinal counterpart .    in virtually all compounds of the above series , superconductivity is observed next to a spin - density - wave state for some critical value on the pressure scale,@xcite whereas antiferromagnetic spin correlations are found to dominate the metallic state precursor to superconductivity over a wide range of temperatures.@xcite on the theoretical side , however , for spin - independent repulsive couplings and for a fermi surface with good nesting properties , the coexistence of spin - density - wave ( sdw ) and superconducting ( sc ) correlations is essentially excluded from the model phase diagram.@xcite it is only when deviations from perfect electron - hole symmetry ( nesting ) are introduced and the long - range component of the sdw order is suppressed that superconductivity can be actually realized in place of magnetism.@xcite in the anisotropic metallic phase where this suppression takes place , interchain cooper pairing is enhanced and superconductivity emerges from the coupling between the weakened electron - hole and the still singular electron - electron scattering channels .",
    "recent calculations @xcite using the renormalization group ( rg ) method did confirm the existence of such an electronic pairing mechanism beyond the level of single - channel rpa - like approaches.@xcite a smooth crossover from the sdw state to superconductivity has then been found whenever the amplitude of nesting deviations reaches some threshold  a result in accordance with the sequence of transitions observed as a function of pressure.@xcite    the rg approach shows nevertheless that whenever antiferromagnetism stands out as the dominant correlation in the normal state , the most stable interchain pairing is invariably a spin singlet state corresponding to a ` @xmath0-wave ' symmetry gap with nodes on the fermi surface .",
    "although some experimental findings in the bechgaard salts and their sulfur analogs do agree with this type of pairing , @xcite other series of observations have rather been interpreted in support of a triplet order parameter,@xcite thus challenging the singlet scenario for superconductivity . though there is too little so far to favor one scenario over another ,",
    "these observations bring us to the question of whether triplet superconductivity can be possible or not when short - range antiferromagnetic correlations are dominant in the metallic state .",
    "as is well known for the electron gas model , there is a region of the phase diagram where triplet ` @xmath10-wave ' superconductivity does exist as the most stable state .",
    "it has been suggested , on a phenomenological basis , that such a state is realized in the bechgaard salts.@xcite within a microscopic approach , the region where @xmath10-wave superconductivity is stable is defined by irrelevant umklapp scattering and by a backward scattering coupling that is much larger than forward scattering .",
    "however , this description pattern for superconductivity can be considered unsatisfactory given the unrealistic constraint it puts on the coupling constants , and for the suppression of both the antiferromagnetism at short distance and the mott pseudo gap in the charge sector.@xcite these flaws can hardly be reconciled with the related phenomenology of these molecular compounds observed around the critical pressure for superconductivity , when either the temperature or the magnetic field is varied.@xcite    another way to look at this problem is to consider more closely the effect of charge fluctuations on superconductivity . staggered charge fluctuations are known to favor triplet pairing at odd but large angular momentum , a mechanism whose roots go back to the early work of kohn and luttinger about cooper pairing in the presence of charge  friedel ",
    "oscillations in isotropic fermi systems.@xcite for the quasi-1d electron gas model and its version for lattice electrons , recent calculations have shown that triplet @xmath1-wave pairing is indeed enhanced when intrachain couplings are chosen to boost charge - density - wave ( cdw ) fluctuations close to the level found in the sdw channel.@xcite however , for realistic repulsive couplings , @xmath0-wave pairing still remains tied to the highest critical temperature and hence to the most stable state for superconductivity .",
    "all this goes to establish the robustness of @xmath0-wave pairing for the model with repulsive intrachain couplings and nesting deviations .",
    "it turns out , however , that the model is incomplete when charge fluctuations are found along the chains since then _ _",
    "inter__chain coulomb interaction is also present in practice .",
    "the inclusion of direct interchain electron - electron scattering processes , which will be denoted by @xmath11 in the following , defines the quasi-1d electron gas model in its extended form.@xcite at large momentum transfer , the interchain interaction is well known to favor a cdw ordered state.@xcite this mechanism is mostly responsible for cdw long - range order observed in several organic and inorganic low - dimensional solids.@xcite the physical relevance of interchain interactions in the bechgaard salts , besides the intrachain @xmath12 and @xmath9 , is supported by x - ray studies , which revealed that the sdw phase of these compounds is actually accompanied by cdw order.@xcite on the theoretical grounds , very little is known about the impact of adding direct interchain interactions on the structure of the phase diagram , especially in the repulsive sector when both a finite @xmath9 and nesting deviations are present .    in this work",
    "we wish to determine the possible density - wave and superconducting states of the extended quasi-1d electron - gas model . in order to tackle this problem",
    "we shall apply the renormalization group method , which at the one - loop level has proved to be suited to reach a controlled description of interfering density - wave and superconducting channels of correlations . among the results reported below",
    ", we have the unexpected finding that a small repulsive interchain backscattering term @xmath2 is sufficient to make @xmath0-wave superconductivity unstable to the benefit of a triplet @xmath1-wave phase .",
    "this occurs despite dominant sdw correlations in the metallic state and stable itinerant antiferromagnetism at lower nesting deviations . under the latter conditions ,",
    "sdw order becomes in turn unstable to the formation of a cdw state when the amplitude of @xmath3 exceeds some critical value . while these features persist when commensurability effects are taken into account and small  half - filling ",
    "umklapp scattering is included , the effect of interchain forward scattering is found to frustrate nearest - neighbor interchain @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave pairing and to favor instead superconductivity with next - nearest - neighbor interchain pairing .",
    "part of these results have been reported in refs .  .",
    "in section  [ technique ] , we introduce the model and the rg scheme employed for the four point vertices and the response functions . by way of illustration ,",
    "the rg results at the one - loop level are given for purely intrachain interactions . in section  [ innter ] , we present the results for non zero interchain backward and forward interactions by which the different possibilities of ordered states in the phase diagram are obtained in the incommensurate case .",
    "the influence of umklapp processes in the half - filled case is examined in section  [ umklapp ] .",
    "a discussion of the results is given in section  [ nnandexp ] , where a possible connection between theory and experiments is made .",
    "we consider a lattice of @xmath13 coupled metallic chains described by the partition function @xmath14 , which is expressed as a functional integration over anticommuting ( grassmann ) fields @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the noninteracting and interacting parts of the action , respectively .",
    "the former part is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the fermionic matsubara frequency , @xmath22 , the wave vector , and @xmath23 , the spin of the fermion field .",
    "the kinetic energy is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the chemical potential taken as temperature independent .",
    "here we have linearized the spectrum in the chain direction , using @xmath26 as the longitudinal fermi velocity , @xmath27 being the parallel fermi wave vector if @xmath28 . throughout this work both the chain lattice constant @xmath29 and the interchain distance",
    "@xmath30 are put equal to unity .",
    "the interchain single electron hopping @xmath9 is considered small with respect to the longitudinal bandwidth @xmath31 . in the following ,",
    "we will take @xmath32 , which is a typical figure for the anisotropy ratio in quasi-1d conductors like the bechgaard and fabre salts.@xcite the next nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath33 in the transverse direction gives the amplitude of nesting deviations . in eq .",
    "( [ perpkin ] ) , we have neglected the possibility of hopping in the third direction , which does not have any sizeable effect on our calculations .",
    "its existence is of course crucial for the stabilization of true long - range order at finite temperature .    in the framework of the quasi-1d electron gas model,@xcite the electron - electron interaction",
    "is parameterized by means of the g - ology approach .",
    "one first distinguishes between right and left moving fermions , depending on their velocity along the chains , so that the grassmann variables @xmath34 become @xmath35 using these definitions , the interaction part of the action takes the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of lattice sites and @xmath38 the reciprocal lattice vector along the chains , which is involved in the umklapp scattering at half - filling .",
    "here we have omitted the so - called @xmath39 contribution for the interaction of electrons of the same branch since this coupling does not contribute to the singular channels of correlation in the renormalization group flow at the one - loop level .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to intrachain and nearest - neighbor chain interactions , the amplitudes of the bare interactions are given by @xmath40 where the only  transverse  momentum dependence comes from the interchain interaction . in this work we analyze the properties of the model for repulsive @xmath41 , @xmath42 and finite umklapp scattering , which is the physically relevant sector for real materials like the bechgaard salts and their sulfur analogs .",
    "the renormalization group can be applied to the problem of quasi-1d systems of interacting electrons in different ways.@xcite in the following , we shall adopt the so - called one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) momentum shell rg scheme , as developed by honerkamp",
    "_ _ et al.__@xcite ( cf .",
    "also binz _ _ et al.__@xcite ) . in this scheme ,",
    "the 1pi vertex functions @xmath43 of a physical system with infrared cutoff @xmath44 are calculated .",
    "only degrees of freedom with energies equal to or greater than the cutoff are integrated out , which allows one to establish a direct link with the low energy effective action @xmath45 with an _ ultraviolet _ cutoff , as obtained in a kadanoff - wilson renormalization group scheme .",
    "according to morris,@xcite if @xmath46 , the effective interactions @xmath47 that appear in @xmath45 are simply @xmath48 .    the free particle propagator is suppressed for energies below an infrared cutoff @xmath44 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the step function . setting all vertices involving more than two particles to zero , the renormalization group equations to the one - loop level are obtained .",
    "we also neglect self - energy corrections .",
    "it is practically impossible to take into account the complete functional dependence of the vertices , which will in general vary with the wave vectors @xmath51 as well as with the frequencies @xmath21 of the incoming and outgoing particles . by means of scaling arguments",
    ", one can show that the frequency dependence is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense , cf .",
    "for example ref .  .",
    "the same is true for the dependence on the _ distance _ of the wave vector @xmath51 from the fermi surface .",
    "irrelevant variables are not necessarily negligible , in the sense that they may in principle have an influence on the rg flow before they vanish . however , the @xmath52 dependence , with @xmath52 the projection of the wave vector on the fermi surface , remains by far the most important one in the low energy limit .",
    "we will hence only consider the dependence of the functions @xmath53 on the positions of the wave vectors along the fermi surface , which we will parameterize by @xmath54 .",
    "due to momentum conservation , it is in general impossible to have all four arguments of a given vertex on the fermi surface .",
    "usually , the flow of the vertices with three arguments on the fermi surface is calculated . in the case of imperfect nesting",
    ", such a procedure will underestimate the sdw correlations . in our case ,",
    "the strong anisotropy of the dispersion relation allows us to make a slightly different choice .",
    "we fix the values of @xmath55 and @xmath21 such that the most divergent contributions to the renormalization group flow are taken into account .",
    "if we define the cooper , landau , and peierls momentum variables @xmath56 we can write the one - loop rg equations in the form @xmath57 in this equation , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are functions of the internal loop momentum - frequency @xmath61 .",
