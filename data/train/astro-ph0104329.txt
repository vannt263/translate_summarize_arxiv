    "the bepposax satellite ( boella et al .  1997 ) has brought a new dimension to gamma - ray burst ( grb ) research , by rapidly providing good localization of several bursts per year .",
    "this has allowed many grbs to be followed up at other wavelengths , including x - ray ( costa et al .  1997 ) , optical ( groot et al .  1997 ; van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 ) and radio ( frail et al .",
    "good positions have also allowed redshifts to be measured for a number of grbs ( e.g. grb 970508 : metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) , providing a definitive proof of their cosmological origin .",
    "the very bright grb 010222 was detected by bepposax on february 22.30799 ut ( piro  2001 ) and ranked as second in fluence and third in flux from all grbs observed by bepposax ( in  t zand et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we began the effort to optically monitor the field of grb 010222 , starting on february 22.4595 ut , i.e. only @xmath1hours after the burst ( with @xmath15hours of that delay being external to our effort ) , using the fred l. whipple observatory ( flwo ) 1.2-m telescope .",
    "the optical counterpart to grb 010222 was first announced by henden ( 2001a ) and we discovered it independently ( mcdowell et al .",
    "the optical transient ( ot ) was easily recognized as a bright ( @xmath16 ) , new object not present in the dss image at the position of @xmath17 ( mcdowell et al .",
    "the ot declined by @xmath18mag during about @xmath19hours of the first night s observations ( henden & vrba 2001 ; stanek et al .",
    "absorption line systems at @xmath20 and possibly also at 0.928 were seen in the optical spectrum of grb 010222 taken within five hours of the burst with the flwo 1.5-m telescope ( garnavich et al .",

    "2001a ) , providing a lower limit to the redshift of the grb source .",
    "the bepposax nfi follow - up of grb 010222 started about @xmath21hours after the burst ( gandolfi  2001 ) and detected a strong x - ray afterglow with a position consistent with the optical transient .",
    "the afterglow was also detected in the radio ( berger & frail 2001 ) , in the sub - millimeter ( fich et al . 2001 ) and in the near infrared ( di paola et al .",

    "most of our data were obtained with the f.  l.  whipple observatory ( flwo ) 1.2-m telescope on three nights : 2001 february 21/22 , february 22/23 and february 24/25 ut .",

    "deep images at late - time were obtained at the 1.8-m vatican advanced technology telescope ( vatt ) on 2001 march 18 and 19 ( ut ) .",
    "twelve exposures of 900 seconds each were taken in @xmath2-band over two nights with an average seeing of 1.2@xmath29 .",
    "the vatt ccd was binned @xmath30 to provide a scale of 0.4@xmath29/pixel .",

    "( 2001 ) reveals small differences of about @xmath31mag for the stars in the field .",
    "such small differences do not affect significantly any of the results in this paper , so for consistency with other photometric studies of grb 010222 we adopt the calibration of henden ( 2001b ) . for the @xmath32-band , these differences are larger , with the vatt - calibrated bright stars in the field being fainter from henden s by about @xmath33mag .",

    "this formula describes power - law @xmath44 decline at early times ( @xmath45 ) and another power - law @xmath46 decline at late times ( @xmath47 ) . for @xmath48",
    "this formula converts to the one used by stanek et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to describe the behavior of grb 990510 afterglow .",
    "this combined fit has nine free parameters : five normalization constants @xmath42 ( one for each band ) and four shape parameters @xmath49 .",
    "we obtain the following values for the parameters : @xmath50day .",
    "these numbers are in good agreement with these derived by sagar et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but are quite different from those of masetti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which can be probably explained by somewhat different data sets used for fits .",
    "when we ran the combined fit to our data only ( 24 @xmath0 points ) , we obtained @xmath51day .",
    "the results of the combined fit are shown as the continuous lines in the fig.[fig : time ] . considering that these data are inhomogeneous",
    ", the combined fit represents very well the overall temporal behavior of the @xmath0 data , with @xmath52 .",
    "it should be noted that the afterglow has a very blue color , @xmath53 , compared to most field stars ( star `` a '' of mcdowell et al .",
    "2001 has @xmath54 ) , so special care should be taken when deriving ot magnitudes in the @xmath32 filter , which is notorious for exhibiting strong color terms .",
    "grb 010222 is located at galactic coordinates of @xmath55 . to remove the effects of the galactic interstellar extinction we used the reddening map of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 , hereafter : sfd ) .",
    "the sfd galactic reddening towards the burst is small , @xmath56 , which corresponds to expected values of galactic extinction ranging from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , for the landolt ( 1992 ) ctio filters and the standard ( @xmath59 ) reddening curve of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "we synthesize the @xmath0 spectrum from our data by interpolating the magnitudes to a common time .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the optical colors of the grb 010222 counterpart do not show significant variation .",
    "we therefore select the epoch of february 22.5025 ut ( @xmath60hours after the burst ) for the color analysis , which coincides with our first @xmath32-band image and is roughly in the middle of our first night s data .",
    "we convert the @xmath0 magnitudes to fluxes using the effective frequencies and normalizations of fukugita , shimasaku & ichikawa ( 1995 ) .",
    "these conversions are accurate to about 5% , so to account for the calibration and interpolation errors we assign to each flux a 7% error ( 10% for the @xmath32-band ) .",
    "note that while the error in the @xmath61 reddening value has not been applied to the error - bars of individual points , we include it in the error budget of the fitted slope ( following sfd we took the error in @xmath61 to be @xmath62mag ) .",
    "the results are plotted in fig.[fig : spectrum ] for the dereddened fluxes .",
    "the spectrum is fitted reasonably well by a single power - law with @xmath63 , somewhat steeper than the spectral slope derived from our low - resolution spectrum ( @xmath64 : jha et al .",
    "2001b ) , although there is a hint of slight downward curvature towards the blue end of the flwo 1.5-m spectrum overplotted in fig.[fig : spectrum ] . indeed ,",
    "when we fit using only our @xmath9 data , we obtain a slope of @xmath65 , in excellent agreement with jha et al .",
    "( 2001b ) .",
    "also , the @xmath66 spectral slope of @xmath67 found by lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) agrees very well with jha et al .",
    "we agree as well with lee et al . in the slopes",
    "derived when also using @xmath68 data .    as mentioned above , both in our broad - band spectrum and in the low - resolution spectrum of jha et al .",
    "( 2001b ) there is a hint of downward curvature towards the blue end of the spectrum , which is also present in lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) data .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discuss possible reasons for such a downturn , including smc - like extinction in the host galaxy ( possibly close to the grb ) .",
    "they find a good fit to their @xmath69 broad - band spectrum when fitting a spectrum with an intrinsic slope of @xmath70 extincted by @xmath71mag of smc - like extinction .",
    "we find that grb  010222 is another example of an optical afterglow which shows a break in its light curve .",
    "grb  010222 has the second earliest observed break ( after grb 980519 : jaunsen et al .",
    "2001 ) and one of the most shallow initial decay rates .",
    "here we compare this burst to other well - observed grb afterglows .    while the lorentz factor is large , there is little observational difference between a spherically expanding shell and a jet .",
    "only when the inverse lorentz factor exceeds the opening angle of the jet does the difference between an isotropic model and a beamed model become apparent and this should appear as a break in the afterglow light curve .",
    "sari , piran , & halpern ( 1999 ) showed that the length of time between the burst and the afterglow break can be used to estimate the jet opening angle , although the estimate depends weakly on the burst fluence and the density of the surrounding gas ( which we take to be 0.1  @xmath72 ) .",
    "the grb  010222 fluence in the @xmath73  kev range of bepposax was @xmath74  @xmath75 ( in t zand et al .",
    "2001 ) at a redshift of @xmath76 ( jha et al .",
    "2001b argue that the @xmath76 system is very likely the grb host galaxy itself ) , corresponding to a luminosity distance of @xmath77gpc ( assuming @xmath78 ) .",
    "thus , the isotropic @xmath79-ray energy release was @xmath80  erg .",
    "grb  010222 had the earliest observed break of any afterglow , occurring at @xmath81days after the burst , which suggests a highly collimated jet .",
    "the derived opening angle of @xmath12 is indeed smaller than any listed in the compilation of frail et al .",
    "the total beamed energy corrected for the jet geometry becomes @xmath13  erg , which is extremely close to the `` standard '' value of @xmath82erg found by frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for a number of other bursts with light - curve breaks .",
    "the optical light curve and spectral indices for the burst are expected to depend on the electron energy distribution and whether the observations are made above or below the electron cooling break frequency .",
    "sari et al . ( 1999 ) predict that at frequencies less than the cooling break , the light curve index , @xmath83 , is related to the spectral index , @xmath84 by @xmath85 for an isotropic burst and @xmath86 for a jet . here",
    ", @xmath87 denotes the index before the temporal break , since at that time it is expected to be indistinguishable from an isotropic burst . for frequencies above the cooling break the initial slope",
    "is @xmath88 and the final slope is simply @xmath89 .",
    "we can plot these relations in an @xmath83 versus @xmath84 space as four lines with the slope for a beamed burst being steeper than that of an isotropic afterglow .",
    "we expect the index before the temporal break to fall on one of the two isotropic models and indeed , when we place a number of well - observed afterglows with temporal breaks on the plot ( fig.[fig : beta ] ) , @xmath87 tends to fall near the isotropic models and @xmath90 along the jet models .",
    "well - observed bursts with light curve breaks are shown : grb  990123 ( holland et al .",
    "2000 ) , grb  990510 ( stanek et al .",
    "1999 ) , grb  991216 ( garnavich et al . 2000a ; halpern et al . 2000 ) , grb  000301c ( garnavich et al . 2000b ; rhoads & fruchter 2001 ) , grb  980519 ( jaunsen et al .",

    "grb  000926 ( the rightmost pair of points in the figure ) does not fit very well on the plot as the light curve index after the break is much too small for the sari et al .",
    "( 1999 ) jet model .",
    "price et al .",
    "( 2001a ) suspect that extinction could explain the mismatch between the temporal and spectral slopes of this object .",
    "extinction will steepen the spectral slope , moving the points to the right in fig.[fig : beta ] , while leaving the light curve parameters unaffected as long as there is no significant color change in the afterglow .    for grb  010222",
    ", the final temporal slope is also too small for jet models given the observed @xmath84 .",
    "the model can be saved if the spectral slope was intrinsically in the range @xmath91 and has been steepened by host extinction . indeed , lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find a good fit to their @xmath69 broad - band spectrum when fitting an intrinsic slope of @xmath70 extincted by @xmath71mag of smc - like extinction ( their fig.2 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the shift in light curve slope across the break , @xmath92 , is independent of extinction to first order so it can provide clues to the break process without the uncertainty introduced by dust .",
    "the size of the shift depends on the electron energy distribution , but panaitescu & kumar ( 2000 ) point out that the spectral cooling break moving through the optical band could also cause or contribute to a light curve break .",
    "the density distribution of the circumburst environment further influences the break amplitude making it difficult to sort out all the possible combinations of parameters .",
    "we plot the change in slope versus the equivalent isotropic energy release of the burst in fig.[fig : eiso ] . for an interstellar medium",
    "an electron cooling break alone could only change the slope by @xmath93 which is inconsistent with all but one burst .",
    "but , for a circumstellar gas distribution the cooling break can change the slope by as much as 1.25 for large values of the spectral index .",
    "this slope change is still too small to explain two observed bursts requiring that at least some of the events be collimated .",
    "the number of well - observed break afterglows is still small , making any conclusions about fig.[fig : eiso ] somewhat foolhardy .",
    "a majority of the break bursts have @xmath94 while two of the bursts have significantly larger break amplitudes of @xmath95 .",
    "there may be a mild correlation with equivalent isotropic energy which suggests that the smallest jump in light curve index occurs at the highest isotropic energies .",
    "why this apparent correlation may exist is unclear , but given the relation between isotropic energy and jet opening angle suggested by frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the break amplitude may be related to the geometry of the burst .",
    "we presented rapid @xmath0 observations of grb 010222 , starting @xmath1hours after the burst .",
    "analysis of the data indicates a steepening decay , independent of optical wavelength , with power - law behavior @xmath4 at early times ( @xmath5day ) and second power - law @xmath6 at late times , with the break time at @xmath96days .",
    "this is yet another example of such a broad - band break for a grb ot and it is very well documented . the broad - band spectral slope and early break time stress the importance of multi - band optical observations for grb studies , especially early after the burst",
    ".    the spectral slope and light curve decay slopes we derive are not consistent with the sari et al .",
    "( 1999 ) jet model despite the presence of a temporal break .",
    "as shown by lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , significant host dust extinction with a star - burst reddening law would flatten the spectral index by as much as 0.5 and match predictions of a jet geometry .",
    "such extinction would still be consistent with our observed spectral energy distribution .",
    "we derive an opening angle of @xmath12 , smaller than any listed in the recent compilation of frail et al .",
    "the total beamed energy corrected for the jet geometry is very close to the ` standard ' energy value found by frail et al . for a number of other bursts with light - curve breaks .",
    "we find a correlation between the estimated isotropic energy release and the change in power - law index across the light curve break with the higher energy bursts showing the smallest change in light curve slope .",
    "it is not clear why this correlation might exist , but the relation between isotropic energy and jet opening angle suggests that the jet geometry may be involved , with bursts which are more highly collimated showing a shallower break ."
