    "<S> we update our previous constraints on two - component hot dark matter ( axions and neutrinos ) , including the recent wmap 5-year data release . </S>",
    "<S> marginalising over @xmath0 provides @xmath1  ev ( 95% c.l . ) for the axion mass . in the absence of axions </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath2  ev ( 95% c.l . ) .    </S>",
    "<S> mpp-2008 - 20    very recently the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment has published its 5-year result for the angular power spectra of the temperature and the polarisation variations of the cosmic microwave background radiation , superseding their previous 3-year measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use this opportunity to update our previous limits on the cosmological abundance of hot dark matter in the form of ordinary neutrinos as well as axions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that axions in the ev mass range thermally decouple after the qcd phase transition and thus form a hot dark matter component . </S>",
    "<S> cold dark matter axions , on the other hand , have much smaller masses , corresponding to a much larger peccei  quinn scale . </S>",
    "<S> these axions are produced nonthermally before and during the qcd phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> our update concerns the former variety of hot , thermal axions , and is performed for the benefit of those interested in limits based on the latest set of data .    the analysis of the wmap 5-year data ( wmap-5 ) is performed using version  3 of the likelihood calculation package provided by the wmap team on the lambda homepage @xcite , and follows closely the analyses of references  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other data sets used in this work and our parameter estimation methodology are described in our previous paper @xcite , in which we also provide references to the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> -@xmath3 plane derived from the standard data set of our previous paper ( excluding lyman-@xmath4 forest ) . </S>",
    "<S> the blue / solid lines correspond to our new results using wmap-5 , while the red / dashed lines are our previous constraints derived from wmap-3 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : contours ] ]    we consider here only the `` baseline case '' of our previous study : we do not include information from the lyman-@xmath4 forest , and use only standard axion couplings to pions . figure  [ fig : contours ] shows our results in the form of 2d marginal 68% and 95% contours in the @xmath0-@xmath3 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the blue / solid lines are our updated contours , the red / dashed lines are our previous results using the wmap 3-year data ( wmap-3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the modifications are very minor . </S>",
    "<S> marginalising over neutrino masses , our new axion mass limit is @xmath5 about 20% tighter than our previous limit . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , the neutrino mass limit after marginalisation over the axion mass is @xmath6 which is identical to our old result .    </S>",
    "<S> these changes are also reflected in the 2d contours in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : contours ] , where a shrinkage in the allowed region in the @xmath3 direction , but not in the @xmath0 direction , is apparent . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is a better measurement of the early integrated sachs  </S>",
    "<S> wolfe effect by wmap-5 , which in turn limits any nonstandard effect due to extra light free - streaming species around the epoch of matter  radiation equality . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also derive a new neutrino mass limit assuming a complete absence of axions , @xmath7    these limits are expected to become more restrictive with the inclusion of smaller - scale data such as the lyman-@xmath4 forest which , however , we consider too vulnerable to systematic uncertainties </S>",
    "<S> . we also note that the wmap-5 favoured value of @xmath8 is slightly larger than the wmap-3 value @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the very strong neutrino mass bound obtained in reference @xcite from the inclusion of lyman-@xmath4 arose partially because the @xmath8 value inferred from the sdss lyman-@xmath4 data is significantly higher than that from wmap-3 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the fact that the wmap-5 and the sdss lyman-@xmath4 measurements of @xmath8 are in better agreement presumably will relax the hot dark matter mass bound from cmb+lyman-@xmath4 data to some extent . </S>"
