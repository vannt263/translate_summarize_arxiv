    "it is desirable to study appropriate generalizations of hartman measurable sets by replacing their characteristic functions by complex valued functions not only taking the values 0 and 1 . the natural definition of a hartman measurable function @xmath25 is the requirement @xmath26 , where @xmath3 is a group compactification of @xmath1 and @xmath27 is integrable in the riemann sense , i.e. its points of discontinuity form a null set with respect to the haar measure on @xmath4 .",
    "this definition is equivalent to the one of r - almost periodicity , introduced in @xcite by s. hartman .",
    "the investigation of the space @xmath28 of all hartman measurable functions on @xmath1 is the content of @xcite .",
    "here we are going to transfer ideas from @xcite into this context .",
    "thus our main topic is to describe @xmath3 only in terms of @xmath8 .",
    "in particular we establish further connections to fourier analysis .",
    "the natural framework for our investigation is that of lca ( locally compact abelian ) groups .",
    "after the introduction we collect in section 2 the necessary preliminary definitions and facts about hartman measurable sets and functions .",
    "section 3 treats the following situation : given a hartman measurable function @xmath29 on an lca group @xmath1 , we know by the very definition of hartman measurability that there is some group compactification @xmath3 of @xmath1 such that @xmath7 for some riemann integrable function @xmath2 .",
    "we say that @xmath8 can be realized in @xmath3 resp . by @xmath27 .",
    "it is easy to see that in this case @xmath8 can be realized as well on any `` bigger '' compactification @xmath30 .",
    "the notion of `` bigger '' and `` smaller '' is made more precise in the next section .",
    "in particular every hartman measurable function can be realized in the maximal group compactification of @xmath1 , the bohr compactification @xmath31 .",
    "the question arises if there is a realization of @xmath8 in a group compactification that is as `` small '' as possible .",
    "if a hartman measurable function @xmath8 possesses a so called aperiodic realization then the group compactification on which this aperiodic realization can be obtained is minimal ( theorem 1 ) .",
    "this approach works for arbitrary hartman measurable @xmath8 if one allows `` almost realizations '' , i.e. if one demands @xmath7 almost everywhere with respect to the finitely additive hartman measure @xmath32 on @xmath1 rather than @xmath7 everywhere on @xmath1 ( theorem [ weilthr ] ) .",
    "whenever @xmath8 is even almost periodic one can guarantee @xmath7 everywhere on @xmath1 .",
    "the group compactification on which the minimal realization of @xmath8 occurs is unique up to equivalence of group compactifications .",
    "it can be obtained by a method involving filters on @xmath1 similar to that presented in @xcite .",
    "the content of section 4 is motivated by the following reasoning : every group compactification of the lca group @xmath1 corresponds to a ( discrete ) subgroup @xmath33 of the dual @xmath11 in such a way that it is equivalent to the group compactification @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath37 is a group compactification admitting an aperiodic almost realization of the hartman measurable function @xmath8 , the corresponding subgroup @xmath38 contains all characters @xmath39 such that the corresponding fourier coefficient @xmath40 does not vanish .",
    "if @xmath8 is almost periodic or if @xmath8 can be realized on a finite dimensional compactification this result is sharp in the sense that the subgroup @xmath41 is minimal with the above property ( theorem [ mincorap ] ) . for general hartman measurable functions",
    "the situation is more difficult .",
    "this is discussed and illustrated by an example .",
    "section 5 summarizes the main results and includes an illustrating diagram .",
    "throughout this paper @xmath1 denotes always an lca ( locally compact abelian ) group . for group compactifications of @xmath1",
    "let us write @xmath42 iff there is a continuous group homomorphism @xmath43 such that the diagram        commutes .",
    "in this situation we say that @xmath44 is covered by @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath44 is covered by @xmath45 ( via @xmath46 ) and @xmath45 is covered by @xmath44 ( via @xmath47 ) then @xmath44 and @xmath45 are called equivalent . in this case",
    "compactness of @xmath48 and @xmath49 implies that @xmath46 and @xmath47 are both topological and algebraic isomorphisms between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 is a partial order on the class of group compactifications modulo equivalence .",
    "the maximal element with respect to this order is @xmath31 , the bohr compactification of the topological group @xmath1 . recall that @xmath51 , the set of almost periodic functions on @xmath1 , is isometrically isomorphic to @xmath52 , the set of continuous functions on @xmath53 .",
    "the mapping @xmath54 , defined via @xmath55 , is an isometry .",
    "note that this is just a different way to characterize those continuous functions on @xmath1 , which can be extended to continuous functions on @xmath53 .",
    "this definition ( which is best suited for our purposes ) is equivalent to the notion of almost periodicity established by bohr resp .",
    "bochner .    for a locally compact abelian ( lca ) group @xmath1",
    "let us denote by @xmath11 the set of all continuous homomorphisms @xmath56 .",
    "we will occasionally identify @xmath57 with the unimodular group @xmath58 .",
    "this will cause no confusion .",

    "every subset @xmath59 induces a group compactification @xmath60 of @xmath1 via @xmath61 and @xmath62    one can show that every group compactification @xmath3 of an lca group @xmath1 is equivalent to the group compactification induced by the subgroup @xmath63 ( theorem 26.13 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus group compactifications of lca groups can be described by subgroups of the dual and vice versa .",
    "the system @xmath64 of all hartman measurable sets on @xmath1 , i.e. the system of all preimages @xmath65 of @xmath66-continuity sets in the bohr compactification @xmath31 of @xmath1 , is a boolean set algebra and enjoys the property that there exists a unique translation invariant finitely additive probability measure @xmath32 on @xmath67 : @xmath68 .",

    "the group of integers , theorem 2 in @xcite states that for any hartman set @xmath94 there is a group compactification @xmath3 such that @xmath83 and @xmath90 coincide .",
    "hence the filter @xmath83 on @xmath93 contains much information about the group compactification @xmath3 : _ if @xmath94 is a hartman measurable set and @xmath37 is a group compactification of the integers such that @xmath20 can be realized on @xmath4 via the continuity set @xmath74 then @xmath95 is a closed subgroup of @xmath4 and @xmath96 , for @xmath97 the canonical quotient mapping . _    in what follows we need to generalize this result to arbitrary ( lca ) groups .",
