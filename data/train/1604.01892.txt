    "in the past few years , monolayer ( ml ) and bilayer ( bl ) transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) have attracted much attention , as they provide a promising candidate for the application in spintronics due to the two dimensionality,@xcite gate - tunable carrier concentration,@xcite as well as the multi - valley band structure.@xcite to realize the spintronic device , a great deal of efforts have been devoted to the study on the carrier spin dynamics in this material , including the spin relaxation@xcite and spin diffusion.@xcite    for spin relaxation , it has been understood that the hole spin relaxation in ml tmds is markedly suppressed @xcite due to the large intrinsic spin splitting.@xcite as for the electron spin relaxation in ml tmds , the in - plane spin relaxation process has been revealed and it is reported that the intervalley electron - phonon scattering makes the dominant contribution.@xcite this arises from the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in ml tmds , which serves as opposite out - of - plane effective magnetic fields ( emfs ) in the two valleys and hence provides the intervalley inhomogeneous broadening@xcite for in - plane spins . for out - of - plane spins ,",
    "the intrinsic dyakonov - perel ( dp ) spin relaxation process@xcite in ml tmds is absent due to the mirror - inversion symmetry.@xcite nevertheless , by breaking the mirror - inversion symmetry through the flexural phonon vibrations , the elliot - yafet process@xcite can be induced to cause the electron spin relaxation.@xcite in addition , with the gate - control experimental technique on carrier density,@xcite the external out - of - plane electric field leads to the rashba soc,@xcite and then the extrinsic dp spin relaxation of the out - of - plane electron spins has been predicted in ml tmds@xcite and confirmed by the recent experiments in ml mos@xmath1.@xcite    compared with ml tmds , the intrinsic soc in bl tmds is absent due to the space - inversion symmetry .",
    "this indicates that the above mentioned suppression on the hole spin relaxation in ml tmds is absent in bl tmds . in the presence of an external out - of - plane electric field",
    "@xmath3 , the experimentally realized rashba soc in bl tmds can be written as@xcite @xmath4 which provides a tunable out - of - plane zeeman - like field @xmath5 with opposite directions in the two valleys . here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the rashba soc parameters ; @xmath8 represents the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) valley . for valley - independent out - of - plane spin polarization ,",
    "the zeeman - like field is superimposed by the identical hartree - fock ( hf ) emf @xmath11@xcite in each valley , leading to the larger ( smaller ) total emf @xmath12 in the valley possessing same ( opposite ) directions between @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in our previous work",
    ", we calculated the hole spin relaxation in bl wse@xmath1 in the presence of the rashba soc.@xcite it is pointed out that due to the presence of the total emf , the conventional inhomogeneous broadening in each valley is reduced by the magnetic field prefactor @xmath15 with @xmath16 the momentum relaxation time , leading to the enhancement on the spin relaxation time ( srt).@xcite therefore , at small ( large ) spin polarization and hence weak ( strong ) hf emf , identical ( different ) srts in the two valleys are obtained .",
    "nevertheless , the intervalley hole - phonon scattering can suppress the difference in the spin polarizations and hence the srts between the two valleys by inducing the spin - conserving intervalley charge transfers with opposite transfer directions between spin - up and -down holes .",
    "therefore , via enhancing the intervalley hole - phonon scattering , the difference in srts between the two valleys at large spin polarization can be markedly suppressed . moreover , during the spin relaxation , the quasi hot - hole fermi distributions with different effective hot - hole temperatures for spin - up and -down holes are found to be induced by the spin precessions at large spin polarization and low temperature , due to the weak hole - phonon scattering but relatively strong hole - hole coulomb scattering . with this effective hot - hole temperature difference between spin - up and -down holes , the intervalley charge transfers said above share different rates in the two opposite transfer directions , making the initially equal densities in the two valleys broken ( refer to fig .  1 in ref .  36 ) .",
    "hence , the valley polarization is built up .",
    "in contrast to the spin relaxation , the study for the spin diffusion in ml and bl tmds is so far rarely reported in the literature . in ml tmds",
    ", it has been reported that the intravalley scattering makes the dominant contribution during the in - plane spin diffusion whereas the intervalley one is marginal.@xcite this is different from the in - plane spin relaxation,@xcite where the intervalley scattering plays an important role . for bl tmds , in the presence of the rashba soc and hf emf , rich physics of the out - of - plane spin diffusion can be expected .",
    "specifically , the spin spatial precession frequency in each valley is determined by@xcite @xmath17 when the diffusion is along the @xmath18 direction . here",
    ", @xmath19 stands for the effective mass of holes .",
    "it is noted that the previous work on ultracold @xmath20k gas by yu and wu@xcite shares similar spin spatial precession frequency [ @xmath21 with @xmath22 acting as an emf , @xmath23 being the soc strength , and the spin polarization parallel to emf ] , except for an additional field @xmath24 perpendicular to emf in bl wse@xmath1 which provides the inhomogeneous broadening.@xcite accordingly , in comparison with the rich regimes of the spin diffusion in cold atoms,@xcite different and rich spin - diffusion features in each valley are anticipated in bl wse@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , due to the valley - dependent total emf strength , different spin - diffusion lengths in the two valleys can be obtained at the weak intervalley scattering .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of the spin spatial precessions , the quasi hot - hole fermi distributions with different effective hot - hole temperatures between spin - up and -down holes are expected at large spin injection and low temperature .",
    "hence , similar to the induced valley polarization in the time domain as mentioned above,@xcite one may also expect a steady - state valley polarization in the spatial domain .    in the present work , by the kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) approach,@xcite we investigate",
    "the steady - state out - of - plane spin diffusion in @xmath0-type bl wse@xmath1 with all the relevant scatterings included . both cases with and without the intervalley scattering ( intervalley hole - phonon scattering )",
    "are studied . for the case without the intervalley scattering , the spin - diffusion processes in the two valleys are independent , and it shown that the spin - diffusion system in each valley can be divided into four regimes by tuning the total emf strength in the corresponding valley , similar to the rich regimes of the spin diffusion in cold atoms mentioned above.@xcite in each regime , the spin - diffusion length shows different dependencies on the scattering , total emf and soc strengths . at small ( large )",
    "injected spin polarization and hence the weak ( strong ) hf emf , the total emfs , determined by the zeeman - like fields ( zeeman - like fields and hf emfs ) , possess identical ( different ) strengths in the two valleys . therefore , similar ( different ) spin - diffusion lengths in the two valleys are observed .",
    "when the intervalley hole - phonon scattering is included , the difference in the spin - diffusion lengths in the two valleys is suppressed .",
    "specifically , at large spin injection , with the different spin diffusion lengths and hence the different spin polarizations along the diffusion direction in the two valleys , the spin - conserving intervalley charge transfers with opposite transfer directions between spin - up and -down holes are triggered , which tend to suppress the difference in the spin polarizations .",
    "the suppression is found to become stronger with the enhancement of the intervalley hole - phonon scattering .",
    "moreover , with a fixed single - side large pure spin injection , we find that a steady - state valley polarization along the spin - diffusion direction is built up at low temperature .",
    "it is further revealed that the valley polarization is induced by the different intervalley charge transfer rates between spin - up and -down holes , which possess opposite transfer directions .",
    "the difference in the intervalley charge transfer rates here arises from the induced quasi hot - hole fermi distributions with different effective hot - hole temperatures between the spin - up and -down holes during the spin diffusion .",
    "in addition , it is found that by increasing the impurity density , the maximum valley polarization along the diffusion direction can be markedly enhanced .",
    "this is very different from the time domain , in which the maximum valley polarization is always suppressed with the increase of the intravalley scattering strength . with the physics of this unique enhancement further revealed , it is shown that larger valley polarization can be reached by increasing the hole density and/or injected spin polarization at large impurity density .",
    "particularly , at the experimental obtainable hole density and injected spin polarization , we report that the maximum valley polarization along the diffusion direction can exceed @xmath2 , providing the possibility for the experimental detection .",

    "<S> the out - of - plane components of the rashba spin - orbit coupling serve as the opposite zeeman - like fields in the two valleys . together with the identical hartree - fock effective magnetic fields , different total effective magnetic field strengths in the two valleys are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> it is further revealed that due to the valley - dependent total effective magnetic field strength , similar ( different ) spin - diffusion lengths in the two valleys are observed at small ( large ) spin injection . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it is shown that the intervalley hole - phonon scattering can suppress the difference in the spin - diffusion lengths at large spin injection due to the spin - conserving intervalley charge transfers with the opposite transfer directions between spin - up and -down holes . moreover , with a fixed large pure spin injection , we predict the build - up of a steady - state valley polarization during the spin diffusion with the maximum along the diffusion direction being capable of exceeding @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is revealed that the valley polarization arises from the induced quasi hot - hole fermi distributions with different effective hot - hole temperatures between spin - up and -down holes during the spin diffusion , leading to the different intervalley charge transfer rates in the opposite transfer directions . </S>",
