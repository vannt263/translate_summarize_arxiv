    "the dicke hamlitonian describes a system of @xmath0 two - level atoms interacting with a single monochromatic electromagnetic radiation mode within a cavity .",
    "it is described in the accompanying article @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this second part is to show that the benefits to employ the coherent basis are valid for a large region of the hamiltonian parameter space , not only to obtain converged values of the energy , but also for the wave function , for the ground state and for a significative part of the energy spectra .",
    "it can be particularly useful to study the presence of chaos @xcite and of excited states phase transitions @xcite in this model .",
    "the interaction between a system of @xmath0 two - level atoms and a single mode of a radiation field can be described by the dicke hamiltonian : @xmath1 the frequency of the radiation mode is @xmath2 , which has an associated number operator @xmath3 . for the atomic part @xmath4",
    "is the excitation energy , meanwhile @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , are collective atomic pseudo - spin operators which obey the su(2 ) algebra .",
    "it holds that if @xmath8 is the eigenvalue of @xmath9 , then @xmath10 defines the symmetric atomic subspace which includes the ground state .",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath11 depends principally on the atomic dipolar moment .",
    "we compare the minimal truncation needed to obtain convergence of the solution , using the two basis defined in ref .",
    "@xcite : the coherent basis @xmath12 and the fock basis @xmath13 .",
    "the wave functions , expanded in the truncated fock ( f ) and coherent ( c ) basis are , for a given @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 for @xmath17 , and @xmath18 for @xmath19 , and @xmath20 enumerates the eigenstates ordered by their energies @xmath21 with @xmath22 assigned to the ground state .",
    "the probability @xmath23 of having @xmath24 photons in the @xmath25-th state in the fock basis , or @xmath26 of having @xmath27 excitations in the coherent basis is : @xmath28 where @xmath29 for @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the ground state probability distribution @xmath31 is shown as a function of @xmath24 or @xmath27 up to @xmath32 or @xmath33 , for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and @xmath36 in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "both wave functions were calculated with the truncation necessary to have the energy converged with @xmath37 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] it is clear that many components which contributes very little to the wave function must be included in the calculations to obtain the desired precision in the ground state energy . it can also be observed in the figures that for @xmath34 , which is @xmath38 in this case , the largest probability is to have no photons in the fock basis , or no excitations in the coherent basis .",
    "the situation is different in the superradiant region , @xmath39 , where in the fock basis the distribution of photons resembles a gaussian curve , with its maximum at a photon number proportional to the number of atoms , while in the coherent basis the probability of having zero excitations remains dominant .",
    "this is the power of the coherent basis , which allows to obtain numerically exact ground state wave functions for numbers of atoms which are intractable in the fock basis .    to study the convergence in the wave function we define its precision @xmath40 @xcite as @xmath41 where @xmath29 for @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "this @xmath42 criteria demands less computing resources than the @xmath43 criteria @xcite , because it requires only the information about one truncation value ( @xmath44 ) instead of two .",
    "[ fig3 ] displays the plots of @xmath45 as a function of @xmath32 , and of @xmath46 as a function of @xmath33 .    a linear fit , for @xmath47",
    "give us the following relation between @xmath33 and @xmath48 : @xmath49",
    "in this section we extend the analysis to the excited states . to accurately evaluate a significative part of the energy spectrum",
    "is a necessary ingredient in the study of quantum chaos @xcite and of excited state quantum phase transitions ( esqpt ) @xcite .    in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we display plots of @xmath42 as a function of the state @xmath25 , for @xmath47 , @xmath34 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in the upper figures we show the @xmath53 and in the lower ones @xmath48 . on the left",
    "the vertical scale is linear and all states are listed in the horizontal axis , while on the right hand side the vertical scale is logarithmic and only the 150 states with lower energies are included .",
    "the horizontal green line depicts the tolerance @xmath54 .     of all states as a function of the state number .",
    "details are given in the text.,title=\"fig : \" ]   of all states as a function of the state number .",
    "details are given in the text.,title=\"fig : \" ]   of all states as a function of the state number .",
    "details are given in the text.,title=\"fig : \" ]   of all states as a function of the state number .",
    "details are given in the text.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it is indeed remarkable to observe in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that a few hundred states calculated in the coherent basis have their wave function converged , and @xmath55 , for these states , grows in a smooth and nearly monotonous way as a function of the @xmath25 index .",
    "this is not the case in the fock basis , where @xmath56 fluctuates by orders of magnitude between a given state and the following one .",
    "it is worth to compare the convergence criteria based in the wave function and described above , with the more standard convergence in energy , which was described in the previous article @xcite . in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we show @xmath48 versus @xmath57 for the first 250 excited states , @xmath25 , whose energies converged in the coherent basis with @xmath58 .",
    "vs @xmath57 for the first 250 states , which convergence is under @xmath59 . ]",
    "a linear fit of these data results in @xmath60=0.71077 -   1.10337\\,\\,log_{10}\\left[\\delta e_{c}(k)\\right ] \\\\ & \\rightarrow \\,\\,\\ , \\delta p_{c}=0.19464\\,\\ , \\left[\\delta e_{c}(k)\\right]^ {    1.10337 }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the number of states whose @xmath42 is smaller than a tolerance @xmath54 for @xmath61 and @xmath32 given for the fock basis and @xmath33 for the coherent basis is presented in table [ tab2 : ] .",
    "the two tolerances selected are @xmath62 and @xmath59 , with @xmath34 and @xmath63 .",
    "the advantages associated with the use of the coherent basis are even more clear in this case , because the number of states whose wave function has converged with the selected tolerance is larger than those whose energies have converged .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that the tolerances in @xmath42 are absolute , because its best case value of a fully converged state is zero , and the worst situation , for completely different wave functions , is one . on the contrary ,",
    "the energy scale is arbitrary , and can have positive and negative values , even some levels with energies very close to zero .",
    "it makes the use of the relative error employed in ref @xcite dangerous when the reference energy is very small .",
    "but for excited states a fixed value of @xmath54 implies the need of more precise digits in the calculated energy , making more difficult the convergence for higher energies .",
    "for this reason our @xmath43 criteria is more stringent than the @xmath42 one : every excited state with converged energy has guaranteed the convergence of its wave function . as the coherent basis provides many converged states with a single truncation value , it is promising to study the presence of excited states quantum phase transitions ( esqpt ) , predicted in dicke - like systems and spin systems for @xmath11 values deeply in the superradiant phase @xcite .",
    "to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dicke hamiltonian for a finite number of atoms it is necessary to perform a numerical diagonalization , employing a truncated boson number space .",
    "two basis , associated with the two integrable limits of the hamiltonian , are used along this work . in the present article",
    "we have shown that , in most of the hamiltonian s parameter regions including the qpt , the coherent basis requires a significative smaller truncation .",
    "we extended the analysis to the convergence in the wave function , exhibiting both convergence criteria as equivalent , and presented the numerical relationships between them .",
    "the study of the probability distributions of the number of bosons was helpful in understanding the differences between the two basis , and the advantages of the coherent basis .",
    "the convergence of the energies and the wave functions was also investigated for the excited states , showing that the coherent basis is very powerful also in this case , allowing to obtain hundreds of converged states with a single truncation value .",
    "this findings can be very useful in order to observe the presence of quantum chaos around the phase transition , as well as to study the excited states quantum phase transitions .",
