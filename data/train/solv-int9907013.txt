    "the integrable discrete geometry deals with lattice submanifolds described by integrable equations . among the integrable discrete ( difference ) equations an important role is played by the hirota equation  @xcite which is the discrete analog of the two - dimensional toda system  @xcite .",
    "both the toda system and the hirota equation are important in the theory of integrable equations and in their applications .",
    "it turns out that the two - dimensional toda system was studied in classical differential geometry and describes the so called laplace sequences of two - dimensional conjugate nets  @xcite .",
    "the lattice geometric interpretation of the discrete toda system was found in  @xcite and is based on the observation that the discrete analog of the conjugate net on a surface , which is given by the two - dimensional lattice made of planar quadrilaterals  @xcite , allows for definition of the corresponding laplace sequence of discrete conjugate nets . since then , the multidimensional quadrilateral lattice  @xcite ( multidimensional lattice made of planar quadrilaterals  the _ integrable _ discrete analog of a multidimensional conjugate net ) became one of the central notions of the integrable discrete geometry .",
    "in particular , many classical results of the theory of conjugate nets and of their reductions have been generalized recently to the discrete level @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present article is to reinterpret and expand results obtained in  @xcite using new notions provided by the general theory of quadrilateral lattices .",
    "different formulations of the hirota equations are reviewed and , for each of them , the geometric interpretation of the corresponding functions is given .    in sections  [ sec : a ] and  [ sec : k ]",
    "we reformulate , using more convenient notation , results found in  @xcite . in section  [ sec : q ] we present the discrete analog of the standard version of the toda system as an equation governing laplace transformations of the rotation coefficients .",
    "then in section  [ sec : tau ] , basing on the geometric interpretation of the @xmath0function of the quadrilateral lattice given in  @xcite , we show that the @xmath0functions of the laplace sequence of quadrilateral lattices solve the original hirota s form of the discrete toda system  this last result fills out the missing point of paper  @xcite .",
    "two dimensional quadrilateral lattice is a mapping of the two dimensional integer lattice into @xmath1 dimensional projective space such that elementary quadrilaterals of the lattice are planar : @xmath2    in the above definition @xmath3 , @xmath4 , denotes the shift operator along the @xmath5-th direction of the lattice .    in the non - homogenous coordinates of the projective space a two dimensional quadrilateral lattice",
    "is represented by the mapping @xmath6 satisfying the laplace equation  @xcite @xmath7 which is equivalent to the planarity condition ; here @xmath8 , @xmath4 , is the partial difference operator , and the functions @xmath9 , define the position of the point @xmath10 with respect to the points @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "planarity of elementary quadrilaterals implies that the `` tangent '' lines containing opposite sides of an elementary quadrilateral intersect .",
    "the laplace transformation @xmath14 , @xmath15 of the lattice @xmath16 is defined @xcite as intersection of the line @xmath17 with the line @xmath18 ( see figure  [ fig : lijx ] ) .",
    "using elementary calculations one can show the following results  @xcite .    in the non - homogenous representation the laplace transformation @xmath19 of the quadrilateral lattice @xmath11",
    "is given by @xmath20    the laplace transformations of quadrilateral lattices are again quadrilateral lattices and the corresponding transformations of the coefficients of the laplace equation   of the lattice @xmath19 read @xmath21    [ prop : lij - lji ] under the assumption that the transformed lattices are non - degenerate , i.e. their quadrilaterals do not degenerate to segments or points , we have @xmath22    in this way given two dimensional quadrilateral lattice @xmath11 one can define a sequence of quadrilateral lattices @xmath23 in analogy to the laplace sequence of conjugate nets , the above sequence can be called the laplace sequence of quadrilateral lattices .",
    "equations  - can be then rewritten in the form @xmath24 which is the discrete analog of the coupled volterra system .",
    "the planarity of elementary quadrilaterals of the quadrilateral lattice and the construction of the laplace sequence are essentially of the projective nature  @xcite",
    ". it would be therefore interesting to know the pure projective - geometric version of the equation describing the laplace sequence of quadrilateral lattices .",
    "the basic numeric invariant of projective transformations is the so called cross - ratio of four collinear points , which is given in the affine representation as @xmath25 notice the simple identity @xmath26 define the function @xmath27 as the cross - ratio of @xmath16 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "elementary calculations show that @xmath31 and , therefore , @xmath32 equations and allow to find the laplace transforms of the projective invariants  @xcite @xmath33 notice that equation   is a simple consequence of proposition  [ prop : lij - lji ] and property   of the cross - ratio .",
    "equations   and can be rewritten in terms of the function @xmath34 in the following form @xmath35 known as the gauge invariant form of the hirota equation .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite it is convenient to reformulate the laplace equation ( [ eq : laplace ] ) as a first order system .",
    "we introduce the suitably scaled tangent vectors @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath37 in such a way that the @xmath38-th variation of @xmath36 is proportional to @xmath39 only ( see figure  [ fig : forward ] ) @xmath40 the coefficients @xmath41 in equation are called the rotation coefficients .",
    "the scaling factors @xmath42 in equation , called the lam coefficients , satisfy the linear equations @xmath43 adjoint to ; moreover @xmath44 the laplace transformation of the lam coefficients and the scaled tangent vectors was found in @xcite and is presented in the following    the lam coefficients of the transformed lattice read @xmath45 the tangent vectors of the new lattice are given by @xmath46    from above formulas follow transformation rules for the rotation coefficients .",
    "the rotation coefficients transform according to @xmath47    equations and can be rewritten in terms of the function @xmath48 as @xmath49",
    "to give the geometric meaning to the @xmath0-function let us introduce  @xcite the vectors @xmath50 pointing in the negative directions @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the backward difference operator .",
    "the scaling factors @xmath53 ( the backward lam coefficients ) are chosen in such a way that the @xmath54 variation of @xmath55 is proportional to @xmath50 only ( see figure  [ fig : back ] ) .",
    "we define the backward rotation coefficients @xmath56 as the corresponding proportionality factors @xmath57    the backward lam coefficients @xmath53 satisfy then the following system of linear equations @xmath58 adjoint to system     since the forward and backward rotation coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath56 describe the same lattice @xmath11 but from different points of view , then one can not expect that they are independent . indeed , defining the functions @xmath59 , @xmath4 , as the proportionality factors between @xmath36 and @xmath60 ( both vectors are proportional to @xmath61 ) : @xmath62",
    "we have the following result  @xcite    [ prop : bf - data ] the forward and backward rotation coefficients of the lattice @xmath11 are related through the following formulas @xmath63 and the factors @xmath64 are first potentials satisfying equations @xmath65    the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : rho - constr ] ) is symmetric with respect to the interchange of @xmath5 and @xmath38 , which implies the existence of a potential @xmath66 , such that @xmath67 therefore equation  ( [ eq : rho - constr ] ) defines the second potential @xmath0 : @xmath68 the potential @xmath0 connecting the forward and backward data is the @xmath0-_function _ of the quadrilateral lattice  @xcite .",
    "let us find the laplace transformation of the @xmath0-function .",
    "formulas and imply that @xmath69 which , due to equation , allows for identification @xmath70 it should be mentioned here that the above formula was strongly suggested by the identification of the schlesinger transformation of the theory of the multicomponent kadomtsev ",
    "petviashvili hierarchy  @xcite with the laplace transformation of conjugate nets  @xcite .",
    "the geometric meaning of @xmath71 as the laplace transformation @xmath72 of the @xmath0-function applies for any dimension of the quadrilateral lattice .",
    "finally , equation rewritten in terms of the @xmath0-function and its laplace transformations take the following form @xmath73 which is the original hirota s bilinear form of the discrete toda system .",
    "the geometric interpretation of the hirota equation ( integrable discrete analog of the toda system ) is given by the laplace sequence of quadrilateral lattices , therefore various representations of the lattice give different versions of the equation .",
    "in the paper we presented four different forms of the hirota equation : ( i )  the discrete coupled volterra system  - for the coefficients of the laplace equations , ( ii )  the gauge invariant form of the hirota equation   for projective invariants of the laplace sequence , ( iii )  the discrete toda system for the rotation coefficients  , and ( iv )  the original form of the hirota equation   for the @xmath0-function of the quadrilateral lattice .",
