    "0.5 truecm the processes of heavy flavour production on nucleon and nucleus targets at high energies are very interesting from both the theoretical and practical points of view .",
    "these processes at high energies are usually considered in the framework of perturbative qcd in the leading and the next - to - leading order @xmath5 expansion . in the case of a nuclear target",
    "it is usually assumed that the cross section of heavy flavour production , @xmath6 , should be proportional to @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , that is , in agreement with the experimental result of [ 1 ] , where a value @xmath9 was obtained for the case of neutral d - meson production at @xmath10 = 39 gev .",
    "however it is experimentally well - known [ 2 - 8 ] that quark distributions in nucleus are slightly different from the same distributions in free nucleons .",
    "so the value of @xmath1 can differ from unity and it seems interesting to estimate it .",
    "we will present in the section 2 the results obtained using the nucleus to nucleon structure function ratios taken from ref . [ 9 ] .",
    "the standard qcd expression for heavy quark production cross section in a hadron 1 - hadron 2 collision has the form    @xmath11\\left[x_bg_{b/2}(x_b,\\mu^{2})\\right ] \\hat{\\sigma}^{ab\\rightarrow q\\overline{q}}(\\hat{s},m_q,\\mu^{2 } ) \\ ; , \\label{eq : totalpf}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 . here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the structure functions of partons @xmath16 and @xmath17 inside hadrons @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively , and @xmath20 is the cross section of the subprocess @xmath21 as given by standard qcd .",
    "the latter depends on the parton center - of - mass energy , the mass of the produced heavy quark @xmath22 and the qcd scale @xmath23 .",
    "( [ eq : totalpf ] ) should account for all possible subprocesses @xmath24 .",
    "the parton cross section @xmath20 can be written in the form @xcite @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27\\;.\\ ] ]    the functions @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be found in @xcite",
    ".    for the numerical calculations we wrote the nuclear structure function @xmath31 in the form @xmath32 similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite and we take the values of @xmath33 for gluons , valence and sea quarks from ref . [ 9 ] for light sea quarks but an enhancement of gluon distributions in the nuclei at small @xmath2 . ] .",
    "they are presented in fig .",
    "the values of @xmath33 in [ 9 ] are presented for @xmath34 that is not small enough at high energies .",
    "so at @xmath35 we used two variants of the @xmath33 behaviour for gluon distributions : the first is the extrapolation as @xmath36 with @xmath37 = 0.096 and 0.040 for the charm and beauty production , respectively ( solid lines in fig .",
    "such behaviour is in qualitative agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "the second is the constant frozen at @xmath38 ( dash - dotted lines ) .",
    "three different sets of parton distributions were used , namely mrs-1 @xcite , mt s - dis @xcite and grv ho @xcite that can be found in cern pdflib @xcite , but they give practically the same results for the @xmath1 behaviour ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we have used in the case of charm production the values @xmath39 = 1.5 gev and @xmath40 = 4 gev@xmath41 and in the case of beauty production @xmath42 = 5 gev and @xmath40 = @xmath43 .",
    "the obtained results for @xmath1 determined from the ratios of heavy quark production cross section on a gold target and on the proton are presented in the table 1 for three sets of structure functions and frozen gluon distribution ratios at @xmath38 and in fig . 2 for the grv ho set and two variants of gluon distribution ratios in the small @xmath2 region .",
    "here @xmath44 is the c.m .",
    "energy for the interaction of the incident proton with one target nucleon .",
    "one can see that at fixed target energies the values of @xmath1 are slightly higher than unity , which is not in contradiction with the result of ref . [ 1 ] .",
    "however @xmath1 decreases with increasing energy and this effect is larger in the case of charm production than in the case of beauty .",
    "one can see also that the difference between two variants for @xmath33 at @xmath35 becomes important only at the highest energies .",
    "we also calculate the values of @xmath1 for different feynman-@xmath2 ( @xmath45 ) regions using @xmath46 at energies @xmath44 = 39 gev and 1800 gev .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "3 . at negative and moderate @xmath45 ( in the nucleus fragmentation region )",
    "the values of @xmath1 are slightly higher than unity .",
    "however in the case of charm production in the beam fragmentation region ( positive @xmath45 ) the values of @xmath1 become essentially smaller than unity . for beauty production",
    "the last effect is expected only at very high energies .",
    "5 mm    we calculate the a - dependence of charm and beauty production using standard qcd formulas and accounting in the difference of parton distributions for free and bound nucleons . if one parametrize the heavy flavour production cross section as @xmath0 , the value of @xmath1 is slightly different from unity at the available energies . at comparatively low energies",
    "the obtained values of @xmath1 are a little larger than unity .",
    "this should be connected with some nucleon - nucleon correlations which change the large-@xmath2 parton distributions .    at higher energies the values of @xmath1 decrease and",
    "become smaller than unity . at @xmath44",
    "= 1800 gev we expect the value of @xmath47 0.95 .",
    "the decrease of the ratios @xmath33 that results in a decrease of @xmath1 can be connected with the effects of parton density saturation @xcite which occurs in heavy nuclei at @xmath2 values higher than in the proton .    if we consider two small and different values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , it is clear that the contribution to the inclusive cross section from the region @xmath50 should be larger than the mirrow contribution ( @xmath51 ) because the value of the ratio @xmath33 in the first case is larger .",
    "it means that heavy quark pairs will be produced preferably in the nucleus fragmentation hemisphere , i.e. , asymetrically , that is quite usual and confirmed experimentally in the case of light quark hadron production . from fig .",
    "3 it is clear that charm production on nucleus at lhc energies should give information on the nuclear shadowing of the structure functions at small @xmath2 .    let us note also that at hera - b energy ( @xmath44 = 39 gev ) with grv(ho ) parton distributions we obtain @xmath52 = 6.8 nb that is in agreement with the experimental value @xmath53 nb of ref . @xcite . however the experimental point should be decreased by 5% because it was obtained as an extrapolation from the gold target data assuming an @xmath54 dependence whereas our calculations give the value @xmath1 = 1.01 .",
