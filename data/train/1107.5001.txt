    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the raw frames were reduced following the nir reduction procedures presented by @xcite , and briefly described here . the two - dimensional frames were sky - subtracted for each pair of images taken at the two nod positions a and b , followed by division of the resultant image by a master flat .",
    "the multiple exposures were combined , followed by one - dimensional extraction of the spectra .",
    "thereafter , wavelength calibration was obtained using the identify / dispcor iraf tasks applied to a set of oh sky line spectra ( each with about 35 sky lines in the range 15500  -23000  ) . the typical error ( 1-@xmath3 ) for this calibration process",
    "is estimated as @xmath420 which corresponds to half of the mean fwhm of the oh lines in the mentioned spectral range .",
    "telluric atmospheric corrections were done using h- and k - band spectra of b type stars obtained before or after the target observation .",
    "the photospheric absorption lines present in the high signal - to - noise telluric spectra , were subtracted from a careful fitting ( through the use of voigt and lorentz profiles ) to the hydrogen and helium absorption lines ( he absorption lines are sometimes seen at 1.70@xmath0 m and 2.11@xmath0 m in the earliest b - type stars ) , and respective adjacent continuum .",
    "optical spectroscopic ccd observations were performed with the boller & chivens spectrograph attached to the 2.5 m du pont telescope at las campanas observatory ( chile ) in june 2010 .",
    "the spectrum was obtained in the framework of the galactic o - stars spectroscopic survey ( gosss , @xcite ) , and therefore using its instrumental setup .",
    "a spectrum of hd93129a was also obtained in june 2010 , and a spectrum of hd93162 ( wr25 ) in may 2008 , during the first gosss southern campaign .",
    "additionally , two optical spectra of wr20a were retrieved from the eso archive under the program 072.d-0082 ( pi rauw ) .",
    "these spectra were obtained with emmi instrument attached to the eso ntt at la silla ( chile ) in february 2004 , and they belong to the same dataset analyzed and published by @xcite .",
    "data were reduced and normalized using onedspec iraf routines .",
    "a journal of the optical spectroscopic observations is presented in table 2 .",
    "in figure 1 we present the telluric corrected ( continuum normalized ) h- and k - band spectra of the wr20aa and wr20c stars , together with those of wr20a , wr20b and wr21a .",
    "the strongest features are the blends of hi and heii emission lines at 1.736@xmath0 m and 2.167@xmath0 m , as well as the hei+niii and heii emission lines at 2.115@xmath0 m and 2.189@xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "a list with the main emission lines and corresponding equivalent line - widths is presented in table 3 .",
    "the similarity between the nir spectra of the known o2if*/wn6 stars with that of wr20aa and wr20c ( figure 1 ) is remarkable , indicating that the later may also belong to the o2if*/wn6 spectral type .",
    "this assumption is reinforced by the close morphological match of the wr20aa h- and k - band spectra with that for wr20a , one of the most massive binaries known to date ( o3if*/wn6+o3if*/wn6 ) for which masses of 83m@xmath5 and 82m@xmath5 were derived @xcite , and by the match of the wr20c h- and k - band spectra with that of wr21a , another extremely massive binary system ( o3if*/wn6 + early o ) , for which @xcite estimated minimum masses of 87m@xmath5 and 53m@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "@xcite showed that some o4if stars ( like hd16691 and hd190429 ) can be erroneously classified as wn stars if observed only in the k - band .",
    "in fact , their k - band emission features are albeit morphologically identical to those seen in the spectra presented in figure 1 . however , as can be seen in @xcite , at least in the case of hd190429 this is not true for the h - band .",
    "indeed , the h - band spectrum of hd190429 is completely different of those shown in figure 1 , being virtually featureless in the mentioned spectral range .",
    "also @xcite present the h - band spectrum of cyg ob2 # 7 ( o3if * ) which shows several h and he lines in _",
    "absorption_. on the other hand , as can be noticed from figure 1 the h - band spectra of wr20aa and wr20c are _ not _ featureless , with all h and he relevant lines clearly seen in _",
    "emission_. in this sense , h- and k - band spectra of heavily reddened massive star candidates may became useful tools to discriminate between the oif * and oif*/wn spectral types .",
    "the spectral morphology derived from nir spectrograms of one of the new sources ( wr20aa ) , is confirmed from new optical spectroscopic observations . in figure 2 , we present the optical spectrum of wr20aa , together with gosss spectra of hd 93129a ( o2 if * ) and wr25 ( o2.5if*/wn6 + o ) obtained with the same instrumentation and setup , along with the archival eso / emmi spectrum of wr20a ( o3if*/wn6 + o3if*/wn6 ) @xcite .",
    "table 4 lists the equivalent widths ( ew ) for the main diagnostic lines used for spectral classification of wr20aa , hd 93129a , wr20a , and wr25 .",
    "the blue spectrum of wr20aa is dominated by heii 4686  and niv 4058  emission lines , together with less pronounced emission lines of niii 4634 - 40 - 42  and siiv 4089  .",
    "numerous absorption lines of hi and heii , and also some diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) at @xmath6 4428 4726 4765 and 4865  are present .",
    "a special mention deserve the strong nv 4604 - 20  absorptions , which are characteristic of the earliest o - type ( o2 - 3 ) and wnha stars .",
    "these absorption lines show weak p - cyg profile structure .",
    "the strength of the niv 4058  emission line relative to the niii 4634 - 40 - 42  emission lines indicates that the spectral type of wr20aa is at least as early as o2 , according to the criteria described in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of a weak p - cyg profile in the h - beta line of wr20aa , compared to the same line in hd93129a , which shows no emission , and the p - cyg profile observed in wr25 , is indicative of an intermediate spectral type between oif * and wnha . in this way",
    ", @xcite suggest that genuine wn6 stars are those with ew of heii 4686  lower than -12  .",
    "the measurement of heii 4686  line in wr20aa ( -9.6 see table 4 ) also indicates an intermediate spectral type . on the other hand ,",
    "no detection of hei absorptions is also indicative of a spectral type earlier than the o3 .",
    "this picture is seen in the direct comparison with the spectra of hd93129a and wr20a , which shows that the blue spectrum of wr20aa resembles better to the later ( as it was already noticed from the nir regime ) .",
    "it is also noticeable from table 4 that the emission lines of wr20aa are closer in strength to those from wr20a , being the lines from the later slightly broader ( this difference is perhaps related to the binary nature of wr20a ) .",
    "consequently , we classify the spectrum of wr20aa as o2if*/wn6 @xcite .",
    "a spectral classification for wr20c using optical mk criteria is not possible in this moment due to the lack of a good signal - to - noise optical spectrum of this star . from inspection of our nir h- and k - band spectra , we find that wr20c is spectroscopically very similar to wr20aa , consequently we propose that wr20c should also be classified as o2if*/wn6 .          in figure 3 it is shown a mosaic made from the 3.6@xmath0 m spitzer irac images @xcite of the region towards the rcw49 complex .",
    "there we identify wr20a , wr20b and wr21a together with wr20aa and wr20c .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the three already known wr stars are well displaced from the core of the wd2 cluster , which harbors at least a dozen of early o - type stars @xcite .",
    "the closest of them ( wr20a ) , is located at about 0.6 arcmin from the cluster centre , with the others being placed at core distances of about 3.7 arcmin and 15.6 arcmin , respectively .",
    "the situation for wr20aa and wr20c is similar to that of wr21a , with the stars localized at angular distances ( from the cluster centre ) of 15.7 arcmin and 25 arcmin , well beyond the wd2 cluster core .",
    "the presence of such massive stars well isolated in the outskirt of the rcw49 complex , naturally leave us to ask : how did they arrive there ?",
    "the assumption of a possible physical connexion between wr20aa and wr20c with the wd2 cluster population , in principle can be tested by comparing the ( b - v ) colors of these new stars with those of the presently accepted cluster members ( wr20a and the 12 known early o - type members ) , which we do in table 5 . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we also included here the colors of wr20b and wr21a , the other two known wr stars in the vicinity of wd2 .",
    "the ( b - v ) colors of wr20aa and wr20c were computed from the b- and v - band photometry shown in table 1 , while the values for the other stars were taken from @xcite ( wr20a and the early - o stars ) , @xcite ( wr20b ) , and @xcite ( wr21a ) . in the case of the early o - stars ,",
    "we indicate the interval of ( b - v ) colors shown in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the corresponding visual extinctions were computed considering intrinsic colors ( b - v)@xmath7= -0.3 magnitudes , and the canonical value for the ratio of total to selective extinction r@xmath8=3.1 .",
    "finally , absolute visual magnitudes were estimated assuming a distance of about 8 kpc @xcite .    in case of",
    "wr20aa we notice that its derived ( b - v ) color and visual extinction are compatible with those for the other massive stars in wd2 , while a very red color index ( b - v)=2.6 was obtained for wr20c , which corresponds to about twice of the visual extinction inferred for the early - o stars of wd2 .",
    "the higher interstellar extinction derived for wr20c is probably due to the presence of a foreground molecular cloud as can be inferred from an inspection of the 2mass j - band source density map of the region towards wd2 .",
    "also , we remember that in the case of wr20c , the star is almost on the galactic plane which increases the probability that a dusty screen is on the line - of - sight of this star .",
    "in fact , it is not unusual that star forming regions present highly variable visual extinctions at scales of a few arcminutes . as examples , we can mention m17 @xcite and the cygnus ob2 association @xcite in which the massive stars present a wide range ( a@xmath8=5 - 12 and a@xmath8=5 - 20 magnitudes respectively ) of individual visual absorptions .",
    "on the other hand , the absolute visual magnitudes derived for wr20aa and wr20c are similar to that for wr20b , which is the only one in the area of rcw49 , not known to be a binary . indeed ,",
    "if we correct the absolute visual magnitudes of wr20a ( o3if*/wn6+o3if*/wn6 ) and wr21a ( o3if*/wn6 + early - o ) in order to take into account the binary companion contribution ( by 0.7 and 0.5 magnitudes , respectively ) , we can see that wr20aa is probably as luminous as the other oif*/wn or wn6 ha stars in wd2 , with wr20c being a bit less luminous than them .",
    "this is not surprising if one considers that stars of same specific spectral types may span a range in absolute magnitudes ( see table 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "it is an observational fact that very massive stars preferentially are found in the core of their parental clusters , normally forming binary or multiple systems .",
    "however , there are a certain number of very young and massive stars that are found well isolated in the field .",
    "two canonical scenarios try to explain the origin of these stars . the first known as the _ binary - supernova scenario _ , considers the disruption of a short - period binary system from the asymmetric supernova explosion of one of the binary components , while the second , named _ dynamical ejection scenario _",
    ", involves dynamical three- or multiple - body encounters in dense stellar systems .",
    "the time scale for the binary - supernova scenario involves values larger than the expected age ( 1 - 2 myrs ) for wn6 ha stars @xcite although lower mass counterparts could reasonably be rather older ( approx .",
    "2.5 myr ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the multiple ejection of massive stars from dense massive clusters is not a new idea ( see discussion in @xcite ) , and recent discoveries of very massive runaway stars ( e.g. 30 dor # 16 ) highlighted the importance of this scenario in the evolution of massive clusters @xcite . for more details on the two models see for example the discussion in @xcite and references there - in .",
    "we searched for some observational constrain that could give support to the scenario in which wr20aa and wr20c were ejected from the wd2 cluster centre following the dynamical ejection model .",
    "we found the surprising result that a line connecting wr20aa and wr20c ( see figure 3 ) intercepts the cluster core _ exactly",
    "_ where the star surface density hits a maximum .",
    "also interesting , a vector conecting wr21a and the wd2 core ( see figure 3 ) forms almost a right angle with the line connecting wr20aa and wr20c .",
    "this apparent configuration strongly resembles the dynamical scenario proposed by @xcite for the origin of ae aur , @xmath0 col and the very eccentric binary @xmath9 ori , as runaway stars . from n - body simulations",
    "the authors conclude that these stars were ejected from their parental cluster as result of binary - binary interactions occurred in the trapezium cluster . in this sense",
    ", it is remarkable to point out that the massive binary system wr21a is known to present a high eccentricity ( @xmath10 , @xcite ) .    the fine geometrical alignment between wr20aa , wr20c and the wd2 core , suggests that these stars possibly had a common origin somewhere in the central part of the cluster , being ejected from their birthplace ( in a timescale not greater than their own age of no more than 2myrs @xcite , with minimum recession velocities ( projected into the sky plane ) of 18kms@xmath11 and 28kms@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "it is also interesting that @xcite performed numerical simulations of a dynamical encounter between single massive stars and the very massive binary wr20a , founding that in a fly - by encounter the average recession velocity attained by a 70 - 80m@xmath5 star could be quite moderate ( less than 30kms@xmath11 ) , being not formally classified as runaway .",
    "taking into account that the o2if*/wn6 type stars are very rare and the perfect alignment of the wr20aa - cluster core - wr20c system , we postulate that both stars probably were formed somewhere in the core of the wd2 cluster , being ejected from their birthplace by dynamical interaction with some other very massive star , in some previous stage of the cluster evolution .",
    "of course , further observational ( radial velocities , proper motions ) , and theoretical dynamical studies are still necessary to properly confirm our assumption .",
    "however , it is our opinion that the impressive alignment seen between such rare stars and the wd2 cluster core , is in fact a strong clue favoring our hypothesis . in this sense",
    ", we speculate that wr20aa and wr20c _ may be _ two of the most interesting galactic runways known to date .",
    "in this work we report the detection of two new galactic o2if*/wn6 stars ( wr20aa and wr20c ) in the outskirt of the massive young cluster wd2 .",
    "the similarity between the nir spectra of wr20aa and wr20c with those of wr20a and wr21a ( two of the most massive binaries known to date ) , is remarkable , suggesting that they could be members of the o2if*/wn6 group .",
    "indeed , the optical spectral morphology indicates that wr20aa presents an intermediate o2 if*/wn6 spectral type , based in the intensities of the emission lines of heii 4686  , niv 4058  , niii 4634 - 40 - 42  , the nv absorptions at 4604 - 20  , and the p - cyg profile observed in h@xmath12 . as an optical spectrum of wr20c is not yet available , we propose for it a spectral type similar to that of wr20a , based on the similarity of their nir spectra .    from the analysis of the spatial distribution of the new o2if*/wn6 stars through the mosaic made from the 3.6@xmath0 m spitzer",
    "irac images of the region towards the rcw49 complex , we found the very interesting result that wr20aa and wr20c are placed at angular distances of 15.7 arcmin ( @xmath1 pc ) and 25 arcmin ( @xmath2 pc ) from the wd2 core , respectively .",
    "the stars are well isolated in the outskirt of the rcw49 complex with the radius vector connecting them intercepting the cluster core exactly where the star density is maximum .    considering the dynamical ejection model",
    ", we propose a scenario in which wr20aa and wr20c had a common origin somewhere in the central part of wd2 , being ejected from their birthplace in a timescale not greater than their own age , which is probably no more than 1 - 2 myrs .",
    "taking into account the _ rarity _ of such massive stars , and considering the perfect geometrical alignment observed between wr20aa , the cluster core , and wr20c , we believe that wr20aa and wr20c may represent one of the most interesting cases supporting the ejection of massive stars , produced by dynamical interaction with other massive companions .",
