    "planets form in circumstellar disks of gas and dust around young stars . hence ,",
    "understanding how protoplanetary disks evolve and disperse is essential to our understanding of the planet formation process .",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed to explain how disks evolve and disperse ( see e.g. hollenbach et al .",
    "2000 for a review ) : viscous accretion ( e.g. lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ) ; mhd winds arising over a narrow range of disk radii near the corotation radius ( x - winds , e.g. shu et al .",
    "2000 ) ; mhd winds originating over a large range of disk radii both inside and outside the corotation radius ( magnetocentrifugal disk winds , e.g. koenigl & pudritz 2000 ) ; photoevaporative winds driven by high - energy photons from the central star ( e.g. clarke et al . 2001 ) , and planet formation ( e.g. hillenbrand 2008 ) . determining which of these mechanisms dominates requires identifying diagnostics tracing these processes as disks evolve .",
    "high - resolution optical spectroscopy of t  tauri stars ( hereafter tts ) has been crucial in identifying accretion and wind diagnostics .",
    "for instance , it is now well established that broad ( several hundred km / s ) permitted hydrogen lines mostly trace disk gas falling onto the star in magnetospheric accretion columns ( e.g. calvet et al . 2000 for a review ) . forbidden emission lines ( such as the bright [ o  i ] line at 6300 ) typically exhibit two distinct components : a high - velocity component ( hvc ) blueshifted by 50200  km / s with respect to the stellar velocity , and a low - velocity component ( lvc ) , typically blueshifted by only @xmath25 - 20km / s ( hartigan et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter heg , panoglou et al .",
    "the hvc is unambiguously tracing collimated jets that in some cases have been spatially resolved at distances from 50 to several au from the star ( e.g. hirth et al .",
    "1997 , hartigan et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the origin of the lvc is uncertain .",
    "the fact that the line ratios in the lvc are very different from those in the hvc indicates that the two components arise from physically distinct regions ( edwards et al .",
    "1989 , hirth 1994 , hamann 1994 , heg ) .",
    "in addition , the finding that the lvc peak velocities are ordered inversely with their respective critical densities ( e.g. @xmath4v@xmath56731\\aa)}\\mid$ ]  @xmath6  @xmath4  v@xmath76300\\aa)}\\mid$ ] ) hints at a disk wind origin ( heg ) . in a disk wind ,",
    "lines with higher critical densities ( like [ o  i ] ) form closer to the disk than lines with lower critical densities ( like [ s  ii ] ) and the flow accelerates as it rises from the disk ( heg ) .",
    "however , mhd winds are generally launched at speeds greater than the local keplerian velocity ( e.g. , knigl and salmeron 2011 ) , and the typical radii at which the mhd winds originate are too small to be compatible with the observed small blueshifts in the lvc ( see ferreira et al .",
    "2006 for a review ) .",
    "more recently , a number of authors have explored the possibility that the lvc of forbidden lines , and in particular the bright [ o  i ] 6300  line , trace a thermal photoevaporative wind driven by high - energy photons from the central star ( e.g. font et al .",
    "2004 , ercolano & owen 2010 , gorti et al , 2011 ) .",
    "these authors have considered the different types of stellar radiation that could thermally drive a photoevaporative flow and explain the properties of the [ o  i ] lvc .",
    "stellar euv photons ( 13.6ev @xmath8100ev ) can be easily ruled out , since the euv - heated layer can not reproduce the large [ o  i ] lvc luminosities that are observed ( font et al .",
    "2004 , hollenbach & gorti 2009 , ercolano et al .",
    "2009 , owen et al .",
    "2010 , ercolano & owen 2010 ) .",
    "this is primarily because the euv - heated layer is mostly ionized and the fraction of neutral gas ( including atomic oxygen ) is very low .",
    "neutral gas , on the other hand , needs to be relatively hot ( @xmath28,000  k ) to thermally populate the upper levels of the [ o  i ] transitions .",
    "heating by hard x - rays ( @xmath91  kev ) is insufficient as typical gas temperatures achieved are relatively low with @xmath10k ( hollenbach & gorti 2009 , ercolano et al .",
    "2009 , owen et al .",
    "2010 , ercolano & owen 2010 ) .",
    "a significant flux of soft x - rays ( @xmath11kev ) capable of heating gas to @xmath12k is needed to produce typical [ o  i ] lvc luminosities .",
    "gas at these temperatures and beyond the gravitational radius ) is the radius where the thermal speed is equal to the escape speed from the disk . ]",
    "is likely to photoevaporate and the observed [ o  i ] lvc has been attributed to this mechanism ( ercolano & owen 2010 ) . a detailed study of the nearby disk of tw  hya has raised yet another possibility : that the [ o  i ] emission comes from cooler gas located below a surface layer , and thus the lines trace a bound disk layer where stellar fuv photons ( 6ev @xmath813.6ev ) dissociate oh molecules ( gorti et al .",
    "2011 ) . in this model",
    "most of the [ o  i ] emission comes from oh photodissociation ( a non - thermal process ) and there is only a small contribution from thermal emission .",
    "the model accounts for three observational properties of the [ o  i ] lines detected toward tw  hya : i ) a low [ o  i]6300/[o  i]5577  line ratio ; ii ) peak velocities centered at the stellar velocity ; and iii ) small fwhms of @xmath210km / s ( pascucci et al .",
    "photodissociation of oh and h@xmath13o molecules was also proposed by acke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to explain the origin of the observed [ o  i]6300  luminosity in a sample of herbig ae / be stars observed with high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "recently , other near- and mid - infrared lines have been proposed as wind tracers . using low - resolution spectra it has been possible to claim that the [ ne  ii ] line at @xmath1412.81@xmath0 m is an important diagnostic for gas in the disk surface ( e.g. gdel et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , ground - based higher resolution observations , gave us more information on the line kinematic .",
    "indeed , this line also shows two distinct components like the optical forbidden lines .",
    "similar to the [ o  i ] line , the hvc of the [ ne  ii ] is clearly associated with jets / outflows ( it has been also spatially resolved toward one source , see van boekel et al .",
    "2009 ) , while the profile and peak velocity of the lvc is consistent with a photoevaporative disk wind driven by stellar x - ray / euv photons ( pascucci & sterzik 2009 , sacco et al .",
    "2012 , baldovin - saavedra et al .",
    "thus , the [ ne  ii ] lvc traces either the euv - heated or the x - ray - heated disk layer we discussed above in the context of the [ o  i ] lvc ( meijerink et al .",
    "2008 , hollenbach & gorti 2009 , ercolano & owen 2010 ) .",
    "a less certain diagnostic of disk winds is the fundamental co @xmath15=10 emission at 4.7 .",
    "spectroastrometry in the co line ( pontoppidan et al .",
    "2011 ) shows non - keplerian motions in a few sources .",
    "those motions are consistent with wide - angle disk - winds .",
    "following up on this finding bast et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and brown et al .",
    "( 2013 ) interpret the small blueshift in the co peaks ( @xmath165km / s ) arising from slow disk wind .",
    "the next step in these studies is to compare different wind diagnostics to understand the structure and evolution of disk winds .",
    "if the [ o  i ] lines arise from thermal emission in a mostly neutral photoevaporative wind , similarities with observed [ ne  ii ] emission may be expected if x - rays partially ionize the neon in the mostly neutral gas .",
    "[ o  i ] produced as an oh photodissociation product will arise in mainly molecular gas and may be more correlated with co emission .",
    "alternately , all three diagnostics may trace different regions of the same wind that is molecular at the base , atomic in the middle , and ionized in its upper layers .    in this paper",
    ", we compare the emission from these three proposed wind diagnostics .",
    "so far such a comparison has been carried out only for four disks and has been restricted to the [ ne  ii ] line and optical forbidden lines .",
    "pascucci et al .",
    "( 2011 ) analyzed twhya , and they found that the [ ne  ii ] and the [ o  i ] lines come from two physically different regions .",
    "baldovin - saavedra et al .",
    "( 2012 ) extended the analysis to three objects .",
    "for cokutau1 they found that the two lines seem to have the same origin , but the comparison does not allow to conclusively determine the origin of the lines ( disk atmosphere or inner bipolar jet ) . in fs  taua both the lines appear to come from a euv / x - ray driven photoevaporative flow . for v853",
    "oph they found that the [ ne  ii ] line is tracing a jet , as only the hvc is detected , while the [ o  i ] lines are compatible with an origin in a photoevaporative wind . according to these previous studies , in three out of four objects",
    "analyzed , the [ ne  ii ] and the [ o  i ] lines seem to arise from physically different regions . in this paper",
    "we expand these studies in two ways : i ) by extending the comparison to the fundamental co ro - vibrational line ; and ii ) by almost tripling the number of objects where different wind diagnostics are analyzed . focusing on the [ ne  ii ] , [ o  i ] , and co",
    ", we aim at tracing the ionized , atomic , and molecular layer of such winds covering disk temperatures from @xmath210,000 to 1,000k .",
    "we also re - analyze already published optical spectra of 30 t tauri stars with disks ( heg sample ) to further constrain the origin of the [ o  i ] emission .",
    "in the following subsections we present our samples and briefly describe the data reduction and analysis ( sections  [ sect_samplei ] and [ sect_hegsample ] ) .",

    "<S> the formation time , masses , and location of planets are strongly impacted by the physical mechanisms that disperse protoplanetary disks and the timescale over which protoplanetary material is cleared out . </S>",
    "<S> accretion of matter onto the central star , protostellar winds / jets , magnetic disk winds , and photoevaporative winds operate concurrently . hence , disentangling their relative contribution to disk dispersal requires identifying diagnostics that trace different star - disk environments . here , we analyze the low velocity component ( lvc ) of the oxygen optical forbidden lines , which is found to be blueshifted by a few km / s with respect to the stellar velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the [ o  i ] lvc profiles are different from those of [ ne  ii ] at 12.81@xmath0 m and co at 4.7@xmath0 m lines pointing to different origins for these gas lines . </S>",
    "<S> we report a correlation between the luminosity of the [ o  i ] lvc and the accretion luminosity @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find any correlation with the x - ray luminosity , while we find that the higher is the stellar fuv luminosity , the higher is the luminosity of the [ o  i ] lvc . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that the [ o  i]6300/5577  ratio is low ( ranging between 1 and 8) . </S>",
    "<S> these findings favor an origin of the [ o  i ] lvc in a region where oh is photodissociated by stellar fuv photons and argue against thermal emission from an x - ray - heated layer . </S>",
    "<S> detailed modeling of two spectra with the highest s / n and resolution shows that there are two components within the lvc : a broad , centrally peaked component that can be attributed to gas arising in a warm disk surface in keplerian rotation ( with fwhm between @xmath240 and @xmath260  km / s ) , and a narrow component ( with fwhm@xmath210  km / s and small blueshifts of @xmath22  km / s ) that may arise in a cool ( @xmath31,000  k ) molecular wind . </S>"
