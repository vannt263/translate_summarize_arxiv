    "this paper is devoted to the study of a simple problem of quantum mechanics : the movement of a particle with position - dependent mass ( pdm ) in a finite square well .",
    "the physical situation modelled by such a potential can be an electron in the conduction band of a semiconductor moving in a heterostructure , let us say @xmath0 , i.e. a thin layer of a semiconductor @xmath1 sandwiched between two somewhat larger semiconductors of identical composition , b ( ref .",
    "@xcite , p.66 ) .",
    "so , simple as it is , this problem involves two important issues : the position - dependent mass ( pdm ) quantum physics and semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "let us shortly comment on these points .",
    "as the effective mass of a charge carrier in a semiconductor depends on the charge carrier - lattice interaction , it changes if the lattice composition or the symmetry changes .",
    "so , excepting the case of a charge moving in a perfect crystal , the effective mass of an electron or hole is , rigorously speaking , position - dependent .",
    "the roots of the position dependent effective mass concept are to be found in the pioneering works of wannier ( 1937 ) and slater ( 1949 ) ( see ref . 1 in ref.@xmath2@xcite ) .",
    "recent papers give explicit methods to obtain explicit solutions of the schrdinger equation with pdm , for various forms of this dependence and for several classes of potentials @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , in practical situations usually encountered in the physics of semiconductor junctions of two materials , @xmath1 and @xmath3 the simplest and more popular form of position dependence of the effective mass is a step function : the effective mass has a constant value in the material @xmath1 and another , constant value , in the material @xmath4 in such a case , the most convenient approach for obtaining the wave functions or the envelope functions in a heterostructure - for instance , a quantum well ( qw ) or quantum dot ( qd)- is to solve the schrdinger equation with bendaniel - duke boundary conditions for the wave function @xcite , @xcite .    the transition from the complex problem of a real semiconductor ( for instance kane theory ) , to the simple problem of a particle moving in a square well with bendaniel - duke boundary conditions is indicated , for instance , in chapter iii of bastard s book @xcite .",
    "this simple problem provides however a realistic description of states near the high - symmetry points in the brillouin zone of a large class of semiconductors .",
    "`` it [ i.e. ' ' the simple problem `` ] often leads to analytical results and leaves the user with the feeling that he can trace back , in a relatively transparent way , the physical origin of the numerical results . ''",
    "( ref.@xmath2@xcite , p. 63 ) .",
    "the boundary conditions for the wave functions or envelope functions at interfaces generate the eigenvalue equations for energy ; of course , different boundary conditions generate different eigenvalue equations .",
    "they are transcendental equations , involving algebraic , trigonometric , hyperbolic or even more complicated functions . with few exceptions ( for instance , the lambert equation ) , their solutions , which can not be expressed as a finite combinations of elementary functions , are not systematically studied .",
    "however , in some situations , quite accurate analytical approximate solutions can be obtained .",
    "this happens in the case of laser dressed potentials @xcite , @xcite , of some applications of the floquet theory @xcite or in the `` algebraization '' of some transcendental equations for eigenenergies of the bound state solutions of the schrdinger equation with a quite large class of potentials @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the `` algebraization '' consists in replacing the trigonometric functions with appropriate algebraic approximations of these functions ; in this way , the transcendental eigenvalue equations can be transformed in algebraic , tractable equations .",
    "the method was introduced by de alcantara - bonfim and griffiths @xcite and used in @xcite in the context of nanophysics ; it generated explicit and simple solutions for the ground state energy of a particle with position independent mass ( pim ) in a square well , _",
    "inter alia_.    we can present now the main contributions of our paper to the aforementioned problems . technically speaking , we shall solve the schrdinger equation for a particle moving in a square well , with bendaniel - duke boundary conditions .",
    "the interesting part of this calculation is to obtain the wave vectors ( and the energies ) of bound states ; obtaining the form of wave functions is a trivial exercise .",
    "the wave vectors are solutions of a couple of transcendental equations , somewhat more complicated than those obtained with usual boundary conditions ( corresponding to a position - independent mass ( pim ) ) .",
    "actually , in the pim case , they involve only the strength of the well , @xmath5 - a parameter which depends both on the potential ( on the depth and the length of the well ) and on the mass of the particle . in the pdm case ,",
    "the eigenvalue equations contain a new parameter , the ratio between the mass of the charge carrier inside and outside the well : @xmath6 .",
    "these exact transcendental equations are replaced with approximate algebraic equations , as just described in the previous paragraph .",
    "the algebraic equations obtained in this way are simpler for the ground state and the first excited states , and more complicated for higher energies . in the first case",
    ", we obtain simple and accurate expressions , for both the @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the relevance of these results for type i and type ii heterointerfaces are discussed .",
    "of course , similar issues of elementary quantum mechanical problems with bendaniel - duke boundary conditions have been already discussed in literature .",
    "in two recent papers , singh and co - workers ( @xcite , @xcite ) obtained approximate solutions for the ground state wave vector replacing the trigonometric functions in the eigenvalue equation with the first few terms in their series expansions .",
    "we consider that this paper is useful for teaching physics at tertiary level for several reasons : ( 1 ) the problem is mathematically very simple , essentially a schrdinger equation for a square potential ; ( 2 ) however , it involves a quite unfamiliar , but important concept , namely the position - dependent mass ; ( 3 ) it shows that not only wave functions , but also enveloping functions satisfy the schrdinger equation ; ( 4 ) it is discussed in the framework of semiconductor nanostructures , a field of great interest for applied and theoretical physics ; ( 5 ) it uses a simple mathematical approach to find approximate analytical solutions of transcendental equations ; ( 6 ) it illustrates the concept of type i and type ii semiconductors ; ( 7 ) it suggests themes of research accessible to undergraduate students ( for instance applying the same approach to quantum dots ) ; ( 8) it makes use of a simple way of finding the real roots of a cubic equation , a subject rarely discussed in undergraduate physics .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following .",
    "section ii will be devoted to the presentation of basic theory : we shall write the schrdinger equation for a position - dependent mass , namely in the simplest case , when the position dependence is given by a step function ; we shall write the normalized wave functions , inside and outside the well , for even and odd states , and the eigenvalue equations for energy - in fact , for the wave vector .",
    "section iii contains most of the original part of our paper .",
    "we use an algebraic approximation for @xmath9 proposed by de alcantara - bonfim - griffiths ( dabg ) @xcite , and another one , proposed by us , for @xmath10 in this way , the eigenvalue equations become tractable , algebraic equations - more precisely , cubic equations .",
    "we obtain simple formulas for the wave vector of the ground state and of the first excited state , if @xmath7 and if @xmath11 if the limit @xmath12 is taken , in each of these cases , the results from ref.@xmath2 @xcite are obtained .",
    "we obtain also simple formulas for shallow wells , irrespective of the parity of state and of the value of @xmath13 the case of excited states of higher order @xmath14 is shortly discussed : the eigenvalue equation can be approximated with a quartic algebraic equation .",
    "the results of this section are relevant for type i heterointerfaces . in section",
    "iv , they are adapted to the case of type ii heterointerfaces and to quantum dots ; also , the condition of validity of the envelope function approximation are discussed .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "as we systematically use formulas for the real roots of a cubic equation , where several authors propose slightly different approaches , we collect in an appendix the minimal theoretical tools to be used in the specific cases studied in this paper .",
    "we shall solve the schrdinger equation for an electron moving in a square well , described by the potential:@xmath15 considering that its mass is position - dependent .",
    "more exactly , the mass inside the well , @xmath16 and the mass outside the well , @xmath17 are different:@xmath18     and valence @xmath19 bands for type i ( a ) and type ii ( b ) semiconductors.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    so , the schrdinger equation for bound states is:@xmath20   \\psi_{n } & = e_{n}\\psi_{n } \\label{schrodinger_eq } \\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    its physically acceptable solutions , i.e. the wave functions , have to satisfy two conditions : the continuity of the wave functions and the continuity of the probability currents density at the interface . the first one is encountered in all quantum mechanical problems , but the second one is specific to the case of the position dependent mass @xcite , defined by eq . , and takes the form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the wave functions inside , respectively outside the well . the eq . is known as the bendaniel - duke boundary condition .",

    "it is easy to see that:@xmath50 @xmath51@xmath52    let us mention that , if the mass is constant , i.e. if @xmath53 , the eigenvalue equations are ( see for instance @xcite , p. 3 . eqs .",

    "so , @xmath57 and replacing @xmath58 with @xmath59 for even states and with @xmath60 for odd states , we can put the equations , in a more convenient form : @xmath61 @xmath62 or , equivalently:@xmath63 @xmath64    for @xmath65 they take the form of the well - known equations for the energy eigenvalues of the finite square well .",

    ", we shall obtain precise analytical approximations for the energy of the first two states , i.e. for the ground state and for the first excited state , considering the cases @xmath7 and @xmath8 separately . for moderate and deep wells ,",
    "the formulas are both simple and accurate . in the limit @xmath69",
    "we shall obtain the result of de alcantara bonfim and griffiths , eq .",

    "we shall replace the exact , transcendental equation eq . with an approximate , algebraic equation , using one of the formulas proposed in ref.@xmath2 @xcite for @xmath78 : @xmath79",
    "ref.@xmath2 @xcite gives two values for @xmath80 , namely@xmath81    the relative errors of the algebraic approximation of @xmath82 are plotted in fig .",
