    "<S> we present studies in bottomonium spectroscopy carried out with samples of @xmath0 million @xmath1 and @xmath2 million @xmath3 events recorded with the babar detector at the pep - ii asymmetric - energy @xmath4 collider at slac . </S>",
    "<S> precise measurements of the branching fractions for @xmath5 and @xmath6 transitions , and searches for radiative decay to the @xmath7 and @xmath8 states are performed using photons that have converted into an @xmath4 pair . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we summarize the results of a search for the spin - singlet partner of the @xmath9 triplet , the @xmath10 state of bottomonium , in the transitions @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>"
