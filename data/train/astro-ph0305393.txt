    "already more than two decades ago it became clear that large regions of the universe are not occupied by bright galaxies @xcite .",
    "large regions of size @xmath10 devoid of galaxies can be clearly seen in all present deep redshift surveys .",
    "the observational discovery was soon followed by the theoretical understanding that voids constitute a natural outcome of structure formation _ via _ gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "together with clusters , filaments , and superclusters , giant voids constitute the large - scale structure of the universe . in spite of the fact that the voids are important for understanding the observed structure of the galactic distribution , they attract much less attention as compared with other elements of the large scale structure such as clusters of galaxies .",
    "@xcite were the first to estimate sizes of voids in different samples of galaxies with measured redshifts .",
    "voids in the cfa redshift catalogs were studied by @xcite .",
    "@xcite made estimates of the void probability function ( vpf ) for the perseus - pisces region .",
    "vpf was estimated for the las campanas redshift survey by @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied voids in the optical redshift survey ( ors ) and in the iras 1.2-jy survey .",
    "they found that large voids with radius @xmath11 occupy about 50% of the volume of the universe .",
    "void distribution in the pscz catalog was studied by @xcite and by @xcite with approximately the same conclusions regarding the sizes of voids and the fraction of occupied volume . for more detailed review of observational efforts",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in spite of significant efforts , there remain some crucial unresolved issues regarding the properties of voids .",
    "voids are defined using bright high surface brightness galaxies .",
    "this is quite understandable : finding and measuring redshifts for dwarf or low surface brightness galaxies is difficult .",
    "for example , the absolute magnitude limit for the sample used by @xcite was @xmath12 ( assuming the hubble constant @xmath13 ) .",
    "the sample used by @xcite was limited by @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , most of the samples are probing voids using galaxies comparable with the milky way .",
    "there were several attempts to find dwarf galaxies in few individual voids @xcite .",
    "the overall conclusion is that faint galaxies do not show a strong tendency to fill up voids defined by bright galaxies .",
    "the limits on absolute magnitudes of observed galaxies are better than for the large samples , but not overwhelmingly so . for example , one of the voids studied by @xcite was at a distance of @xmath15 , but at that distance the observational sample was complete only up to @xmath16 . for other voids",
    "the limit was only @xmath17 .",
    "the strongest arguments that voids are not populated by dwarf galaxies were given by @xcite who points out that the dwarf galaxies in the ors catalog follow remarkably close the distribution of bright galaxies : there are no indications that they fill voids in the distribution of bright galaxies . in this case",
    "the ors catalog can `` see '' galaxies with absolute magnitudes @xmath18 up to 10  mpc distance and within this distance the voids are clearly empty .",
    "a potential problem with this statement is that we do not know whether the ors catalog is missing or not low luminosity and low surface brightness galaxies . at these magnitudes the galaxies are likely to have low surface brightnesses .    to summarize ,",
    "observations indicate that large voids found in the distribution of bright @xmath19 galaxies are empty of galaxies , which are two magnitudes below @xmath20 .",
    "the situation at lower limits is not clear .",
    "void phenomenon was a target of many theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "vpf was studied by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "our main interest is not the statistics or the shapes of the voids .",
    "we focus on the issue of emptiness of large voids .",
    "are voids empty or are they filled with dark matter haloes ? what is the structure of the dark matter distribution in voids ?",
    "does it present a problem for the standard cosmological model ?",
    "these are the questions we are trying to address in this paper .",
    "emptiness of voids is of additional interest in view of problems of the hierarchical models on small scales : the large abundance of dark matter satellites of milky way size haloes @xcite and problems with explaining rotation curves in central parts of dwarf and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both problems are on scales of @xmath21 , which can be probed by the abundance of dwarf galaxies in voids .    to some degree the interest for dwarfs in voids is inspired by @xcite , who claims that the cdm models have severe problems : they predict too many dwarfs .",
    "while peebles did not try to make any quantitative estimates of the number of galaxies or dark matter haloes inside voids of large size , the reasoning seems to be simple and straightforward . at large redshifts",
    "the density in a region , which later will become a void , is not much different from the average density of the universe at that redshift .",
    "thus , the fluctuations grow and haloes collapse . at later times",
    "the density in the region declines and the fluctuations effectively stop growing .",
    "the number of collapsed haloes is preserved in the comoving volume of the void .",
    "this leads to a large number of expected haloes and galaxies in the void .",
    "for example , a void with a density of 1/10 of the average density of the universe is expected to have the number density of galaxies roughly one tenth the average density of galaxies in the universe , which gives many galaxies because of the large void volume .",
    "@xcite argue that gravity removes haloes from voids .",
    "that would reduce the number of haloes and galaxies .",
    "our results show that this does not happen and thus can not solve the problem .",
    "the simple argument of stopping the growth of fluctuations and of subsequent dilution of the halo density by void expansion must work at some scales .",
    "in that respect @xcite is right .",
    "the only question is what is the scale and what happens on larger scales .",
    "significant progress in understanding the void structure was made recently by @xcite and @xcite , who used a combination of @xmath0-body simulations with semi - analytical methods to predict abundance of galaxies in voids in cosmological models .",
    "it was found that the voids are empty even of dwarf `` galaxies '' .",
    "unfortunately , the mass resolution in simulations used by @xcite and @xcite is low if one wants to address the issue of dwarfs .",
    "the best simulations used by @xcite had the particle mass @xmath22 , which leads to the minimum halo mass of few times @xmath4 , which is not much smaller than the mass of our milky way galaxy .",
    "@xcite had better mass resolution of @xmath23 giving the minimum halo mass @xmath24 .",
    "one of the goals of our paper is to extend the limit to much smaller masses to find what happens with real dwarfs in large voids .",
    "indeed , our mass resolution is almost a hundred times better : we are able to detect haloes with mass @xmath5 .",
    "we also develop analytical estimates of the mass function of haloes , which we test against simulations and then apply to much smaller masses .",
    "one significant advantage of the approach used by @xcite and @xcite is that they were able to estimate luminosities of galaxies hosted by dark matter haloes .",
    "we do not try to estimate luminosities .",
    "instead , our high resolution simulations provide the maximum circular velocities of haloes , which gives us a good idea of what kind of galaxies we are dealing with .",
    "we note that in any case the estimates of luminosities in semi - analytical models are still very uncertain for dwarf haloes : physics of these galaxies is still poorly understood .",
    "this problem is worsened by low mass resolution in the simulations of @xcite and @xcite , who used haloes with as few as 10 particles to track the history of smallest galaxies .",
    "the estimates of the maximum circular velocities are better because they do not depend on what is assumed about the star formation in dwarf galaxies .",
    "yet accurate estimates of circular velocities require high resolution @xmath0-body simulations : internal structure of haloes should be resolved .    in order to get a rough estimate of what luminosities",
    "may be expected for galaxies hosted by haloes in our simulations we present examples of dwarf galaxies in the local group , which have measured circular velocities and luminosities .",
    "if haloes in simulations host the same type of galaxies , we should expect the same luminosities .",
    "ngc 6822 and ngc 3109 are irregulars with circular velocities about @xmath25 and absolute magnitudes @xmath26 in the case of ngc 6822 @xcite and @xmath27 for ngc 3109 @xcite . for haloes with the maximum circular velocity of @xmath28 the virial mass is about @xmath29 if we assume halo concentrations in the range @xmath30 . for galaxies with this virial mass @xcite",
    "give slightly larger luminosity of @xmath31 .",
    "haloes with virial mass @xmath32 play important role for voids .",
    "we find that voids start to fill up with haloes with masses smaller than this mass .",
    "@xcite give absolute magnitudes @xmath33 between @xmath34 and @xmath35 for galaxies with these virial masses .",
    "the maximum circular velocities for haloes of this mass are about @xmath36 , which is comparable with the circular velocity of the spiral galaxy m33 ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we investigate the formation of voids in the standard cosmological model : a spatially flat @xmath39-dominated universe with scale - invariant adiabatic gaussian fluctuations .",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the age of the universe in this model is approximately @xmath43 gyrs .",
    "these parameters are favored by recent cosmological observations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the normalization @xmath42 of our simulations is a rather conservative value @xcite .",
    "some recent observational results suggest a substantially lower normalization or a lower density parameter @xmath44 @xcite . @xcite found @xmath45 , their table 1 contains a compilation of recent estimates of @xmath46 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : simu ]",
    "we present our numerical simulations .",
    "we discuss briefly the void finding algorithm which we used to find voids in the distribution of dark matter haloes of a low resolution simulation and the resimulation of the regions of selected voids with a higher mass resolution .",
    "section [ sec : analyt ] is devoted to the formalism of analytical predictions of the mass function in voids . in section [ sec",
    ": voids ] we discuss the mass and halo distribution in voids . in section",
    "[ sec : massfunc ] we compare the analytical predictions of the mass function with the mass function measured in the high resolution simulations of voids .",
    "we discuss how the mass function depends on the normalization and a changing slope of the power spectrum as recently proposed by the wmap collaboration @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results .",
    "the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) @xmath0-body code of @xcite was used to run all numerical simulations analyzed in this paper .",
    "this code uses adaptive mesh refinement technique to achieve high resolution in the regions of interest .",
    "the computational box is covered with a uniform grid which defines the lowest ( zeroth ) level of resolution .",
    "the code then reaches high force resolution by recursively refining all high density regions using an automated refinement algorithm .",
    "the shape of the refinement mesh can thus effectively match the geometry of the region of interest .",
    "this algorithm is well suited for simulations of a selected region in a large computational box , as in the simulations presented below . during the integration , spatial refinement",
    "is accompanied by temporal refinement .",
    "namely , each level of refinement , @xmath47 , is integrated with its own time step @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the global time step of the zeroth refinement level .",
    "in addition to spatial and temporal refinement , simulations described below also use a non - adaptive mass refinement algorithm to increase the mass ( and correspondingly the force ) resolution inside a specific region @xcite .",
    "we start with running a low resolution simulation with @xmath50 particles covering the whole computational box . for",
    "that we make a realization of the initial spectrum of perturbations with @xmath51 particles in the simulation box .",
    "initial coordinates and velocities of the particles are then calculated using all waves ranging from the fundamental mode @xmath52 to the nyquist frequency @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the box size and @xmath55 is the number of particles in the simulation .",
    "then we replace every @xmath56 particles with particles of larger mass . a large - mass ( merged ) particle is assigned a velocity and displacement equal to the average velocity and displacement of the small - mass particles .",
    "once a simulation with @xmath50 particles is completed , we select voids and identify all particles inside the voids",
    ".    then we restart the simulation keeping high mass resolution for particles in voids .",
    "particles outside the high resolution region are merged in several steps so that the high resolution region corresponding to @xmath51 particles is surrounded by shells with resolution corresponding to @xmath57 and @xmath58 particles .",
    "the remaining part of the simulation box is simulated in low mass resolution corresponding to @xmath50 particles .",
    "high force resolution is only achieved inside the region with high mass resolution .",
    "the details of this multi - mass technique are described by @xcite .      in order to study the formation of large voids",
    ", the simulation box should be sufficiently large ; we use a cube of 80  on a side .",
    "this is sufficient because we are not interested in a statistics of large voids , which would require a significantly larger volume .",
    "our main interest is in the structure of a typical @xmath59radius void .",
    "the 80  box is large enough for that .",
    "we focus on the formation of small structural elements ( haloes and filaments ) inside voids , for which we need the highest possible mass resolution .",
    "the limitation of @xmath51 particles gives the @xmath60 per particle .",
    "this leads to the minimum halo mass of @xmath61 .",
    "a halo with this mass has the maximum circular velocity @xmath62 .",
    "inside the high resolution region we reach the force resolution ( one cell ) of @xmath63 .",
    "we make 250000 time - steps on the highest resolution level .",
    "the identification of haloes is always a challenge .",
    "the widely used halo - finding algorithms , the friends - of - friends ( fof ) and the spherical overdensity , both discard `` haloes inside haloes '' , i.e. satellite haloes located within the virial radius of larger haloes . we have developed two algorithms that do not suffer from this drawback : the hierarchical friends - of - friends ( hfof ) and the bound density maxima algorithms ( bdm , see @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithms are complementary .",
    "they find essentially the same haloes .",
    "thus we believe that the algorithms are stable and capable of identifying all dark matter haloes in our simulations .",
    "the advantage of the hfof algorithm is that it can handle haloes of arbitrary shape , not just spherical haloes .",
    "the advantage of the bdm algorithm is that it describes the physical properties of the haloes better by identifying and removing unbound particles . in particular",
    "it estimates not only the mass of a halo , but also its maximum `` circular velocity '' , @xmath64 .",
    "this is the quantity which is more meaningful observationally .",
    "numerically , @xmath65 can be measured more easily and more accurately than the mass . in order to compare the velocity function of haloes measured in simulations with analytical predictions",
    "one has to convert the virial masses into circular velocities assuming an nfw density profile @xcite .      in order to identify voids , we start with construction of the minimal spanning tree for selected haloes .",
    "typically we select haloes with mass larger than @xmath66 , but different criteria were also used .",
    "then we search on a grid with mesh size @xmath67 for the point in the simulation box which has the largest distance @xmath68 to the set of haloes .",
    "this is the centre of the largest void the radius of which is @xmath68 .",
    "we exclude this void and search again for a point with the largest distance to the set .",
    "this gives the second largest void and so on .",
    "the algorithm is similar to that used by @xcite .",
    "@xcite use a somewhat more complicated search algorithm based on `` wall '' and `` field '' galaxies , where field galaxies are allowed to be also in voids .    in principle , our algorithm ( as the algorithm of @xcite ) allows for the construction of voids with arbitrary shape : the starting point is a spherical void which can be extended by spheres of lower radius which grow from the surface of the void into all possible directions .",
    "however , in the following analysis we have restricted ourselves to spherical voids to avoid ambiguities of the definition of allowed deviations from spherical shape .",
    "in this section we provide a formalism for predicting the mass function of dark matter haloes in voids .",
    "there are different ways of constructing the mass function in voids . using the barrier - crossing formalism of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "@xcite generalized the press - schechter approximation so that it can be applied to over- and under - dense regions .",
    "the validity of this approach has been verified against @xmath0-body simulations by @xcite .",
    "a better approximation is provided by ( * ? ? ? * st ) .",
    "we compare predictions based on this approximation with our @xmath0-body results and find that it does not provide an accurate fit to the results of simulations .",
    "this motivates us to develop our own approximation .    for completeness",

    "the parameter @xmath88 is essential for this approach .",
    "it provides truncation for objects with large mass : as the amplitude of perturbation @xmath92 approaches the amplitude of perturbation of the void , the number density of haloes goes to zero .",
    "the effect of truncation is `` felt '' even for much smaller objects .",
    "the formalism of the constrained mass function in the version proposed by @xcite is rather complicated and arbitrary in a sense that the series in equation ( [ v15 ] ) is not well motivated and the parameters of the model are adjusted by comparison with @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we introduce an alternative and in our opinion much more straightforward and natural method of predicting the mass function in voids .",
    "as we will show in section [ sec : massfunc ] , it also reproduces our simulated mass functions more accurately .",

    "we want to quantify this statement .",
    "we divided our sample of haloes in the five voids into two subsamples containing 164 haloes with circular velocities 55 km / s @xmath136  km / s and 207 haloes with circular velocities 20 km / s @xmath137  km / s .",
    "each void was divided into five shells of equal volume . in figure",
    "[ fig : halo_distrib ] we show the mean number density of haloes in the five shells the radius of which is normalized to the void radius .",
    "the thick line in the figure corresponds to the haloes with higher circular velocities , while the thin one to those with lower velocities .",
    "one can clearly see that there is a tendency for the haloes to concentrate more at the outer parts of the voids .",
    "this tendency is more pronounced for the more massive haloes ( thick line ) , their density in the outer shell is almost a factor of three higher than in the central sphere .",
    "km / s ( thick line ) and 20 km / s @xmath138 km / s ( thin line ) in shells of equal volume ( @xmath139 ) for five voids .",
    "the radius of the shell is normalized to the void radius . ]    down to the limit of @xmath5 we find thousands of haloes in the simulation .",
    "now we are interested in the mass function of haloes in different voids and its dependence on the mean density in the void .",
    "we select all haloes inside the assumed void radius @xmath140 or @xmath141 depending on the void and estimate the mass function of haloes in each of the voids .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass_func_simu ] shows the five mass functions measured in the five simulated voids . the mean dark matter density in the voids ( see figure [ fig : density ] ) is about @xmath142 for the larger voids with @xmath143 and @xmath144 for the smaller voids with @xmath145 .     and mean density @xmath146 , while the three thin solid lines denote voids with radius @xmath147 and mean density @xmath144 ( see figure [ fig : density ] ) . ]     but scaled by @xmath148 .",
    "the dashed line denotes the mass function of the field according to the sheth - tormen formalism , thin and thick solid lines correspond to voids with different radii as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_func_simu ] . ]",
    "the different mean ( under)densities of the simulated voids result in different mass functions .",
    "the higher the density in voids the higher is also the number density of haloes .",
    "the number density of haloes in voids is about an order of magnitude smaller than in the whole box as expected due to mean density in voids which is also about an order of magnitude smaller @xcite .",
    "this can be also seen in figure [ fig : mass_func_simu_n ] where we have shown the mass function of field haloes obtained by the sheth - tormen formalism .",
    "this mass function is in excellent agreement with the mass function measured in the whole 80  box @xcite .",
    "in figure [ fig : mass_func_simu_n ] we have scaled the mass functions in voids with the mean density contrast measured in the void with respect to the mean density of matter in the universe , @xmath149 . now",
    "the scatter between the mass functions of the different voids is smaller .",
    "note , that the shape of the mass function in voids is steeper than in the whole box .",
    "one can clearly see that after rescaling the overall mass function with the density in voids , the less massive halos are as abundant in voids as the general mass function predicts .",
    "the more massive halos , on the other hand , are deficient in the voids .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : mass_func_comp ] shows predictions obtained using constrained sheth - tormen mass function equations ( [ eq : cst])-([v17 ] ) with @xmath150 and assuming the size of the void @xmath151 mpc ( smaller sizes of voids result in steeper mass functions ) .",
    "the analytical results presented here differ from those of @xcite in that they assumed @xmath152 in equations ( [ v16])-([v17 ] ) to fit the simulated mass function better while here we keep the value @xmath78 advertised by sheth and tormen everywhere .",
    "the constrained mass functions do not provide good fits to the @xmath0-body results .",
    "they are too steep and are a factor of 210 below the simulations .",
    "they are especially bad for voids with very low densities .    in the bottom panel in figure  [ fig : mass_func_comp ]",
    "we compare the simulated mass functions with the predictions based on rescaled mass function given by equation  ( [ v11 ] ) . to make the analytical predictions we use the same values of the mean density as in the simulated voids :",
    "@xmath153 . for voids with these densities",
    "we get the corrected values for the normalization of the power spectrum @xmath154 respectively .",
    "it is clear that the rescaled mass functions provide much better fits to the simulations . yet , the fits are not very accurate .",
    "one may try to improve the fits by changing parameters @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 in equation  ( [ v11 ] ) .",
    "after all , values of these parameters to some extent were tuned to fit @xmath0-body simulations . however",
    ", this is not a good way to improve the approximation : predictions are quite stable .",
    "for example , the values of @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 suggested by @xcite do not change our results significantly and do not produce better agreement with simulations .    ) to the predictions ( dashed lines ) based on constrained st mass function ( top panel ) and rescaling the unconstrained st mass function ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the dashed curves from the highest to the lowest are for @xmath158 . ]    .",
    "the two thick solid lines correspond here to the radius @xmath159 , while the three thin solid lines correspond to the radius @xmath160 .",
    "dashed curves show predictions from the rescaled st mass functions for @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the analytical predictions and numerical results are now in a very good agreement . ]    the low accuracy of the approximation can be traced to the fact that we assume a constant density of the dark matter inside a void . at the same time",
    "simulated voids have density , which visibly increases close to the void boundaries .",
    "the number density of haloes ( especially massive ones ) is very sensitive to the average dark matter density as clearly illustrated by figure  [ fig : halo_distrib ] .",
    "this inconsistency in treatment of the voids is the main reason for poor quality of the fits .",
    "the tendency of more massive haloes to concentrate in the outer part of the voids is also in agreement with the slowly increasing cumulative volume fraction of voids defined by samples of haloes with different minimum circular velocities ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : voidvolumes ] ) .",
    "in fact , if those haloes were uniformly distributed one would more often expect that one of the big voids will be divided into two smaller ones if one decreases the threshold of the halo mass or circular velocity defining the voids .",
    "this is not the case as one can see from the small differences in the volumes of the largest voids defined in the set of haloes with different circular velocities ( see figure  [ fig : voidvolumes ] ) .    in order to reduce the effect of the varying density , we find the simulated halo mass function using void radii which are 20% smaller than their actual radii .",
    "figure [ fig : mass_func_volume ] shows the results .",
    "the full curves represent the mass functions measured in the five voids with the reduced radii .",
    "they are now steeper at the high mass end .",
    "the dashed curves show the predictions based on the rescaled sheth - tormen approximation ( the same as in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : mass_func_comp ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the analytical predictions and numerical results is now significantly improved .",
    "even now the normalization of the power spectrum of density perturbations has some uncertainties .",
    "observational constraints before recent wmap results give uncertainty of about 10% for the parameter @xmath46 ( see @xcite for sdss estimates and for a discussion of other measurements which have a tendency to predict low values of @xmath46 ) .",
    "however , the wmap results @xcite again favour @xmath163 if the perturbation spectrum is scale invariant with @xmath164 . the mass function in voids is affected by all these uncertainties : it becomes steeper with decreasing normalizations of the background power spectrum ( with other cosmological parameters unchanged ) .     and @xmath42 ( dashed line ) in comparison to the mass function obtained for @xmath165 and scale - dependent spectral index @xmath166 ( solid line ) as proposed by wmap @xcite .",
    "]    the combination of wmap results with other cmb measurements , 2df and lyman @xmath127 forest results indicate a lower normalization of @xmath165 together with a scale - dependent slope of the primordial power spectrum @xmath166 with @xmath167 mpc@xmath168 @xcite . using these parameters",
    "we apply the rescaled st approximation to estimate the halo mass function in voids .",
    "figure  [ fig : normal ] shows the estimates .",
    "as expected , the mass function is then less steep than the mass functions with the same normalization and a constant slope @xmath164 .",
    "on the other hand , decreased normalization makes it steeper so the net effect is that it is just shifted down with respect to the mass function found for @xmath42 and @xmath164 .",
    "note , that in figure  [ fig : normal ] the mass function is shown down to @xmath169 .",
    "this is far beyond the range which can be tested in a numerical experiment , but due to the good agreement between the numerical simulation and the analytical approach we expect that the rescaled st mass function can be extended to smaller masses . using this approximation we predict that in a typical void of diameter @xmath170 there should be about 100 000 objects of mass greater than @xmath169 .",
    "it is a challenge to observers to confirm this prediction .",
    "recently , the existence of a large population of hydrogen clouds in voids has been claimed @xcite .",
    "these clouds could be associated with a fraction of the numerous haloes which we found in the simulated voids .",
    "the expected number of dark matter haloes of different mass depends on the void ( under)density . in figure  [ fig : mass_func_omega1 ] we show predictions for the number of haloes inside a typical void of radius @xmath171 for haloes with mass larger than @xmath2 , @xmath123 and @xmath172 as functions of the average density of the void .",
    "there is a dramatic decline in the number of haloes when the average density of the void falls below a certain percentage of the mean density .",
    "the larger the mass of the haloes , the larger is the void density at which the sharp decline happens .",
    "this decline is related to the steepening of the void mass function at the high mass end as seen in figure  [ fig : mass_func_simu_n ] .",
    "note , that for typical voids with the average density ten times below the mean density , the number of @xmath172 haloes is not yet suppressed : the sharp decline is at lower average densities .",
    "( bottom curve ) , @xmath123 ( middle curve ) , and @xmath172 ( top curve ) inside a typical void of radius @xmath171 as a function of the average density of the void @xmath173 .",
    "these predictions come from the rescaled unconstrained mass function . a `` void '' with @xmath174 has the average matter density in the universe . ]",
    "we used @xmath0-body simulations to study the formation of voids in the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "we first identified dark matter haloes and then searched for voids in the distribution of the haloes .",
    "we found that the size of the voids depends weakly on the lower mass ( or circular velocity ) limit of the haloes chosen to define the void .",
    "voids in a set of more massive haloes tend to be slightly larger than voids in a set of smaller haloes .",
    "the interior of five largest voids was resimulated with very high mass resolution of @xmath175 .",
    "these voids have diameters of about @xmath176 and their density is about a factor of 10 smaller than the mean density in the universe . inside a void of this size",
    "we found typically about 50 haloes with circular velocities larger than 50 km / s and more than 800 with circular velocities larger than 20 km / s .",
    "a scale - dependent slope of the primordial power spectrum as recently suggested by @xcite would slightly reduce the number of low mass haloes in voids .",
    "@xcite find `` several void regions with diameter @xmath177 in the simulations where gravity seems to have swept away even the smallest haloes '' they `` were able to track '' .",
    "according to their table  1 they tracked haloes down to 10 particles corresponding to halo masses @xmath178 . in our simulations of voids of diameter @xmath179 we find typically up to 10 haloes of this mass ( represented by 1000 particles ) .",
    "more than half of the haloes are close to the outer void boundary with a distance to the void s centre larger than 80% of the void s radius .",
    "since our void volume is 8 times larger and more massive haloes tend to be situated in the outer part of the void it would be not extremely unprobable to find inside our voids regions of @xmath180 free of any halo more massive than @xmath181 . in this respect",
    "we agree with @xcite .",
    "following the evolution of voids numerically it seems that these haloes are not swept away by gravity but never form in regions with the lowest density .",
    "the fact that regions devoid of haloes with masses larger than @xmath182 are smaller than those devoid of haloes with masses bigger than @xmath183 emphasizes our argument that the size of the voids depends on the objects used to define the void .",
    "for example , the voids in the distribution of clusters are not empty : they contain many @xmath184 galaxies .",
    "likewise , the voids in a sample of @xmath184 galaxies should contain dwarfs .",
    "this argument suggests that voids in the dark matter distribution should be self - similar in the same sense as clusters of galaxies have hundreds of galaxies and galaxies have hundreds of satellites .",
    "it must be so as long as only the gravity is the dominant factor and the spectrum of fluctuations is approximately scale invariant .",
    "the question whether luminous galaxies form or do not form in all these dark matter haloes is then the most important question in the theory of galaxy formation in different environments .",
    "assuming with @xcite a luminosity @xmath185 for a galaxy hosted by a halo of @xmath178 we predict about five of these galaxies to be found in the inner part of a typical void of diameter @xmath179 . in principle",
    "they can be detected . in",
    "the giant ( radius 31.5 mpc ) botes void @xcite study void galaxies in about 1% of the void volume .",
    "all but one of them were substantially brighter than @xmath186 .",
    "the one reported with @xmath187 is the companion of a brighter one . to compare the model predictions with observations",
    "one would have to study a void in the distribution of galaxies with limiting magnitude @xmath33 between @xmath34 and @xmath35 which roughly corresponds to our threshold mass of @xmath188 .",
    "note , that so far we assumed that each dark matter halo hosts a galaxy .",
    "this may not be true .",
    "physical processes of galaxy formation are not well known and there could be processes that strongly suppress the formation of stars inside small haloes , which collapse relatively late in voids .",
    "one such process which has been widely discussed is the ionizing flux ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we determined the mass function of dark matter haloes in the simulated voids and compared it with the analytical predictions based on the sheth - tormen formalism .",
    "the formalism was applied in two versions : ( 1 ) we used the ansatz for the constrained mass function proposed by @xcite and ( 2 ) we proposed our own extension of the unconstrained mass function of @xcite by rescaling the power spectrum in the void .",
    "we found that our approach is not only much simpler in application , but also reproduces more accurately the mass functions obtained in the simulations of voids .",
