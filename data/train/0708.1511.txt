    "in recent years it has become evident that low mass stars and brown dwarfs ( spectral classes late - m and l ) are capable of producing unanticipated levels of magnetic activity , manifested primarily in their strong quiescent and flaring radio emission @xcite .",
    "other traditional activity indicators such as chromospheric balmer line emission and coronal x - ray emission , however , appear to steeply decline from peak levels in early and mid m dwarfs @xcite , leading to divergent trends of magnetic activity at the bottom of the main sequence . in both h@xmath1 and x - rays",
    "there is also a clear transition from persistent emission to a small number of flaring objects with duty cycles of a few percent @xcite , as well as a breakdown of the rotation - activity relation @xcite that is clearly seen in early m dwarfs @xcite .    the change and divergence in activity trends",
    "is most clearly evident in the breakdown of the radio / x - ray correlation that holds for a large number of early - type stars and solar flares @xcite , and is attributed to flare heating of coronal plasma to x - ray temperatures @xcite . while objects in the range m0m6 obey this correlation , several objects later than m7 exhibit radio emission that is several orders of magnitude brighter than expected @xcite .",
    "similarly , in early m dwarfs there is an overall energy balance between x - ray and chromospheric emission , which has led to the idea of chromospheric heating by coronal x - rays ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "studies of the @xmath10 dynamo in fully convective stars suggest that a stratified and rotating turbulent medium can lead to the build - up of a non - axisymmetric and multi - polar field ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but these models make several simplifications for computational purposes .",
    "it has also been argued that decreasing electrical conductivity will impede the dissipation of any magnetic fields in the cool and increasingly neutral atmospheres of ultracool dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the existing radio detections suggest that field dissipation may not be a problem , but the overall field configuration and the effect of neutral atmospheres in the presence of magnetic dissipation remain largely unexplored .    as a result of the various conflicting trends and the transition from persistent to flaring emission , progress in our understanding of magnetic activity and dynamos in ultracool dwarfs requires",

    "thus , the observed count rate of @xmath46 s@xmath19 translates to a flux of @xmath47 erg @xmath45 s@xmath19 ( @xmath40 kev ) , or a flux density of @xmath48 njy at @xmath49 kev . at the distance of  the corresponding luminosity",

    "this limit corresponds to a ratio of uv to bolometric luminosity of @xmath65 .",
    "we observed  across a wide wavelength range that traces activity in various layers of the outer atmosphere .",
    "the radio emission traces particle acceleration by magnetic processes , and corresponds to gyrosynchrotron radiation or coherent radiation ( electron cyclotron maser or plasma emission ) .",
    "the balmer emission lines are thought to be collisionally excited in the chromosphere , and the x - ray thermal emission arises in the corona .",
    "using the observed x - ray flux and temperature in the context of bremsstrahlung radiation we can estimate the coronal gas density and pressure .",
    "the emissivity is given by : @xmath66 where for , @xmath67 and @xmath68 hz .",

    "we note that a coronal structure with a low volume filling factor , @xmath73 , would have a correspondingly higher density , @xmath74 . given this overall uncertainty , the inferred density is similar to what has been found for the m4.5 flare star ad leo ( flares : @xmath75 @xmath72 , quiescent : @xmath76 @xmath72 ; @xcite ) and is somewhat lower than in the m3.5 flare star ev lac ( @xmath77 @xmath72 ; @xcite ) .    from the temperature and inferred density we find a coronal gas pressure of @xmath78 dyne @xmath45 .",
    "this does not take into account turbulent pressure , which at coronal temperatures may in fact be dominant ( e.g. , @xcite . if the corona is confined by magnetic fields , the required average field strength is thus @xmath79 g.    an alternative estimate of the coronal physical parameters can be provided in the context of the loop model calculated by @xcite . in this model the loop temperature , density , and pressure are related by @xmath80 k , where it is assumed that the loop apex temperature is similar to the mean coronal temperature .",
    "the loop length , @xmath81 , is determined by the observed x - ray luminosity , @xmath82 cm , where @xmath73 is the filling factor of the loops .",
    "the simple relation between @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath81 holds as long as @xmath85 along the loop .",
    "this requires the loop length to be less than the pressure scale height , @xmath86 cm ( for @xmath87 r@xmath17 and @xmath88 m@xmath17 ) . from the observed parameters we find @xmath89 cm and @xmath90 cm .",
    "the condition @xmath91 thus requires a very small filling factor , @xmath92 .",
    "the pressure inferred from using @xmath93 is @xmath94 dyne @xmath45 , and the magnetic field required for confinement is thus @xmath95 g , in good agreement with the value inferred above by assuming a uniform coronal structure .",
    "we now turn to the radio emission .",
    "the bremsstrahlung contribution in the radio band is @xmath96 @xmath24jy , orders of magnitude lower than even the baseline quiescent emission , which from several flare - free regions of the radio light curve is found to be @xmath97 @xmath24jy .",
    "the @xmath62 limit on the fraction of circular polarization of the quiescent component is @xmath98 .",
    "both the flux and degree of circular polarization are similar to those measured in previous observations (  [ sec : obs ] ) , indicating that the quiescent component is stable on a multi - year timescale .",
    "based on the brightness of the radio emission compared to the predicted thermal emission , and its long term stability , we conclude that it is most likely due to gyrosynchrotron radiation .",
    "we follow the typical assumption that the mildly relativistic electrons , which produce the radio emission , follow a power law distribution , @xmath99 for @xmath100 , with @xmath101 typical for m and l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the gyrosynchrotron emission spectrum is determined by the size of the emission region ( @xmath102 ) , the density of radiating electrons ( @xmath103 ) , and the magnetic field strength ( @xmath104 ) according to @xcite : @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight",
    ".    from previous observations of  it appears that the peak of the quiescent emission spectrum is @xmath109 ghz @xcite . using the limit @xmath98",
    ", we infer a magnetic field strength , @xmath110 g , for @xmath111 . with this range",
    "we find @xmath112 cm , and @xmath113 @xmath72 ; the latter range is for @xmath114 to @xmath115 .",
    "a comparison to the coronal density estimated from x - rays indicates @xmath116 , and hence @xmath117 cm and @xmath118 g. the inferred field strength is consistent with the value required for confinement of the x - ray emitting coronal plasma as derived above .",
    "finally , we turn to the observed h@xmath1 emission .",
    "the light curve exhibits clear sinusoidal behavior with a range of equivalent widths of @xmath119   ( figure  [ fig : all ] ) .",
    "the sinusoidal behavior indicates that the line is likely modulated by the rotation of rather than flares , and the emission is thus persistent in origin , at least on the timescale of our observation .",
    "@xcite determined a multiplicative factor , @xmath120 , to convert h@xmath1 ew to @xmath121 . for , the observed @xmath122 mag indicates @xmath123 , which matches the average value for spectral type m8.5 @xcite .",
    "thus , for the full range of ews we find @xmath124 to @xmath125 .",
    "this covers the typical range of h@xmath1 emission observed from m8.5 dwarfs @xcite , as well as the range of ews from past observations of this source (  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "we return to the implications of the sinusoidal variations in  [ sec : halpha ] .    since the x - ray and h@xmath1 emission",
    "appear to be persistent , we can gain insight into the physical processes in the outer atmosphere by examining the energy scale in each band . in early dme stars",
    "there is evidence that the quiescent chromosphere is heated by downward directed coronal x - ray emission @xcite",
    ". nearly half of the absorbed energy will be radiatively lost in the balmer lines , primarily h@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "here we find that the ratio @xmath126 is in rough agreement with this overall model , taking into account the overall uncertainties in the x - ray and h@xmath1 luminosities .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , any significant asymmetry in the coronal structure ( e.g. , extended loops ) will substantially reduce the x - ray flux directed at the chromosphere .",
    "since we find that the h@xmath1 line by itself already accounts for the maximal coronal heating rate , this model of chromospheric heating requires a uniform coronal structure .",
    "alternatively , the marginal excess chromospheric luminosity may indicate that the structure of the outer atmosphere in this late - m dwarf is markedly different than in early dme stars .",
    "potentially , the h@xmath1 emission is dominated by a non - chromospheric component . as we discuss below , in the context of the periodic emission , it is possible that the h@xmath1 emission region is a more extended `` bubble '' that co - rotates with the star .",
    "in addition to the persistent emission in the radio band we detect several distinct short duration ( @xmath127 min ) flares , and a single broad brightening with a duration of about 1 hr ( figures  [ fig : all ] and [ fig : flares ] ) .",
    "these flares range in peak flux density from @xmath128 to @xmath129 mjy .",
    "our observations allow the detection of flares to a @xmath130 sensitivity of about @xmath131 mjy in a single 5 s integration . in figure",
    "[ fig : flares ] we provide a zoom - in on the most distinct flares , including both the total intensity light curve and the circular polarization light curve .",
    "about half of the flares exhibit left circular polarization , while the other half exhibit right circular polarization , with overall fractions of @xmath132 .",
    "there is no apparent regularity in the duration , brightness , arrival time , or circular polarization of the flares .",
    "the apparently random sense of circular polarization ( right- vs.  left - handed ) and flare arrival times suggest that the flares are produced in unrelated regions .",
    "this is contrary to the model proposed by @xcite to explain their detection of periodic flares , with @xmath133 hr well - matched to the rotation of .",
    "these authors point to emission from a distinct region that is stable over at least several rotation periods .",
    "the absence of a similar behavior in our data suggests that this stability is limited to @xmath134 yr .",
    "the variation in the sense of circular polarization from one flare to the next is also different from the uniform sense of polarization observed in radio flares from uv cet ( m5.5 ) and yz cmi ( m4.5 ) .",
    "flares in these two stars show consistent right - handed and left - handed polarization , respectively , which has been interpreted as a signature particle acceleration in a toroidal dipole field @xcite .",
    "the behavior of radio flares from  in the current observation thus points to a multi - polar field configuration .    while the quiescent radio emission is due to gyrosynchrotron radiation , the short durations and large fraction of circular polarization of the flares point to emission by coherent processes .",
    "the electron cyclotron maser ( ecm ) process leads to emission at the fundamental cyclotron frequency , @xmath135 hz , while plasma radiation is dominated by the fundamental plasma frequency , @xmath136 hz . in the ecm case the magnetic field strength inferred from the detection of flares at 8.46 ghz is @xmath137 kg , while in the case of plasma radiation we infer an electron density of @xmath138 @xmath72 .",
    "the latter should be used as an upper limit in the ecm model .    in the standard picture of the electron cyclotron maser ( e.g. , @xcite ) , electrons with a large pitch angle",
    "are reflected at the legs of the magnetic loop , while those with smaller angles precipitate into and heat the chromosphere .",
    "this process repeats , with the rise time of the emitted flare presumably reflecting the particle acceleration timescale .",
    "the flare decay reflects the time to precipitate out of the magnetic trap , and is thus related to the loss rate , @xmath139^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath140 is the solid angle of the loss cones , @xmath141 is the electron velocity , and @xmath81 is the transit length @xcite . from our observations at 8.5 ghz we infer @xmath142 , and hence @xmath143 s leads to , @xmath144 cm .",
    "the actual size of the loop region is likely to be much smaller since the accelerated electrons traverse the field lines multiple times before the maser process ceases .",
    "thus , whereas in the case of the periodic outbursts a stable , dipolar field configuration was inferred @xcite , here it is likely that the emission is arising from a tangled , multi - polar field .",
    "finally , the ecm processes is supposed to provide coronal and chromospheric heating as electrons precipitate out of the trap , and thus lead to increased h@xmath1 and x - ray emission . from figure",
    "[ fig : all ] it is clear that this is not the case for .",
    "none of the flares radio are accompanied by an increase in either the h@xmath1 or x - ray emission .",
    "this may provide further support to the proposed tangled field configuration , since it will lead to chromospheric and coronal effects on a small scale that may go undetected when averaged over the stellar disk .",
    "as noted above the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 emission lines exhibit sinusoidal variations with a periodicity of about 2 hours ( figure  [ fig : all ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the likely origin of the balmer line modulation is the rotation of . indeed with @xmath145 cm , the 2-hour period requires a rotation velocity of @xmath146 km s@xmath19 , in perfect agreement with the observed @xmath18 km s@xmath19 .",
    "if the balmer lines are modulated by rotation , this indicates an inclination of the rotation axis relative to the line of sight of @xmath147 .",
    "the likely connection to stellar rotation points to a large scale ( @xmath148 ) hot spot located on one hemisphere of , or an emission `` bubble '' that may extend to several times the stellar radius , and is occulted by the star for about half a rotation period .",
    "as noted above , the latter scenario may be relevant since the observed h@xmath1 luminosity appears to exceed the x - ray luminosity by a factor of a few , raising the possibility of an h@xmath1 emission region distinct from the chromosphere .",
    "the fact that the balmer lines do not completely disappear during the light curve minima suggests that in both scenarios the solid angle subtended by the emission region is larger than the stellar disk , or alternatively , that the minima represent the baseline chromoshperic emission , while the rotation of an extended bubble or a hot spot into our line of sight produces the maxima .",
    "it also appears from the h@xmath1 light curve that the peak equivalent width decreases with time ( figure  [ fig : all ] ) .",
    "the first peak has @xmath149  followed by about 4.5 for the two subsequent peaks , and about 3.8   for the fourth peak . while our observations start during the decline of a preceding cycle , an extrapolation back to the time of the expected peak indicates an equivalent width of at least 6  .",
    "the equivalent widths at the minima , however , appear to be more stable , with perhaps a slight decrease from 2 to 1.5   during our observation .",
    "these trends suggest that the hot spot or extended bubble may be transitory , possibly excited by an energetic event prior to the beginning of our observations .",
    "extrapolating the observed trend , we find that the peak h@xmath1 equivalent width will match the baseline level of 1.5 about 7 hrs after the end of our observation .",
    "future observations of  are crucial for assessing whether this is in fact a transient feature .",
    "we further find no clear correspondence between the peaks of h@xmath1 emission and the radio flares .",
    "in fact , the opposite may be the case .",
    "the three h@xmath1 minima that have simultaneous radio coverage appear to roughly coincide with radio flares .",
    "if we extrapolate the h@xmath1 light curve back in time , we find that a previous minimum also appears to coincide with a radio flare ( at about 05:40 ut ) .",
    "however , other radio flares , including the brightest one detected , do not coincide with observed or extrapolated h@xmath1 minima , suggesting that this anti - correlation between h@xmath1 and radio emission may be a result of small number statistics .",
    "the detection of a 2 hour period in two different emission bands and at two different times with no clear correspondence indicates that the radio flares are not sufficiently energetic , or impact a large enough scale to influence the chromosphere .",
    "this behavior also suggests that the magnetic field configuration of  may be composed of a large - scale dipolar field , as well as a more compact and tangled component , which give rise to periodic signals at different times and wavebands .",
    "is only the third ultracool dwarf to be observed simultaneously in the radio and x - rays , allowing a continued investigation of the radio / x - ray correlation in these objects .",
    "coronally active stars up to spectral type m7 , including the sun , exhibit a tight correlation between their radio and x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the persistent emission follows a linear trend , @xmath150 hz@xmath19 , which extends over 6 orders of magnitude in @xmath151 @xcite , while for flares the relation is @xmath152 hz@xmath19 over 8 orders of magnitude in @xmath151 @xcite ; see figure  [ fig : gb ] .    from several previous ( non - simultaneous ) observations",
    "it has become clear that the above correlations break down in at least some ultracool dwarfs @xcite , with a clear transition occurring at spectral type m7 @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was supported by our simultaneous observations of the l3.5 dwarf 2mass j00361617 + 1821104 @xcite . here",
    "we find continued evidence for this trend .",
    "using the persistent radio and x - ray luminosities we find @xmath153 hz@xmath19 , a factor of about 7800 times larger than expected .",
    "this is similar to the level of excess radio emission observed in the previous late - m and l dwarfs .",
    "if we take into account the flaring emission , with a typical peak luminosity of @xmath154 erg @xmath45 s@xmath19 hz@xmath19 , and assume that the single x - ray photon pair with @xmath155 erg @xmath45 s@xmath19 is indeed a flare (  [ sec : xrays ] ) , we find that for flares @xmath156 hz@xmath19 , a factor of about @xmath157 larger than expected .",
    "the radio / x - ray correlation has been interpreted in the context of the neupert effect @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the radio emission is produced when coronal magnetic loops reconnect and create a current sheet along which ambient electrons are accelerated .",
    "the accelerated electrons in turn drive an outflow of hot plasma into the corona as they interact with and evaporate the underlying chromospheric material .",
    "the interaction of the outflowing plasma with the electrons produces x - ray emission via the bremsstrahlung process .",
    "this mechanism points to a causal connection between particle acceleration , which is the source of radio emission , and plasma heating , which results in x - ray emission .",
    "thus , the x - ray thermal energy should simply be related by a constant of proportionality to the integrated radio flux . the breakdown in the radio / x - ray correlation , and the clear lack of correspondence between the radio flares observed on  and its x - ray emission suggest that the heating of coronal material is generally inefficient in objects later than m7 .",
    "this may be due to the short lifetime and small size of the flare emitting regions ( i.e. , in the case that they arise from highly tangled and multi - polar fields ) , or to lower efficiency of coronal heating so that the bulk of the coronal emission is at temperatures lower than @xmath158 kev .",
    "we presented simultaneous radio , x - ray , uv , and optical spectroscopic observations of the m8.5 dwarf  that probe magnetic activity and its influence on the stellar chromosphere and corona .",
    "these observations are the first in a series of several objects that span the sparsely - studied spectral type range m7l3 , over which the magnetic activity appears to exhibit a change in behavior compared to early spectral types .",
    "we find that  exhibits a wide range of both quiescent and flaring activity that includes radio emission from large and small scale regions , coronal soft x - ray emission , and sinusoidal and periodic balmer line emission from a chromospheric hot spot or an extended structure with a covering fraction of about @xmath3 .",
    "quantitatively , we find that the quiescent radio emission is produced on the scale of the entire stellar disk , with a magnetic field of @xmath4 g. from portions of the light curve that are free of flares we see no evidence for variability of this persistent component .",
    "moreover , the similarity in flux level to observations carried over the past 6 years indicates that the magnetic field is stable on timescales significantly longer than the convective turnover time , @xmath159 d @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the situation we observed in 2mass j00361617 + 1821104 ( l3.5 ) , with a periodic radio signal that was stable over at least 3 years @xcite .",
    "we also find from a comparison of the radio and x - ray data that the magnetic field axis is likely highly inclined relative to the rotation axis of , which is inferred from the 2-hour period of the h@xmath1 emission to be about @xmath160 (  [ sec : halpha ] ) .",
    "this is an interesting result in the context of magnetic dynamo models of fully convective stars . @xcite and @xcite found that the @xmath10 dynamo , which relies on a stratified and rotating turbulent medium , leads to a non - axisymmetric field with an overall configuration that lies in the equatorial plane .",
    "this seems to be supported by our observations .",
    "the x - ray emission requires a corona with @xmath161 k and a density of @xmath162 @xmath72 , similar to those of early m dwarfs .",
    "the inferred coronal gas pressure requires a magnetic field strength of at least @xmath163 g for confinement , in good agreement with the radio - derived field strength .",
    "the energy input from the x - ray emitting corona is similar to , or somewhat smaller than , the radiative losses in the balmer emission lines , indicating that the chromosphere is at least partly heated by the overlying corona .",
    "it is possible , however , that the somewhat elevated chromospheric luminosity is the result of an energy input process that took place before the start of our observations .",
    "this latter possibility is supported by the apparently decreasing level of peak h@xmath1 flux during our observation , and the nearly constant baseline level traced by the light curve minima .",
    "indeed , the h@xmath1 luminosity during the minima is about half of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "in addition to the persistent emission , we detect a large number of radio flares with a range of peak fluxes , durations , and degrees of circular polarization .",
    "the overall short durations of the flares and large degree of circular polarization are indicative of coherent emission . in the context of the electron cyclotron maser mechanism ,",
    "the inferred magnetic field is about 3 kg , similar to fields on the most active early m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "similar flares have been detected in previous observations of , but with a 2 hour periodicity that is absent in our data .",
    "the 2 hour period was attributed to compact polar regions in a dipolar field rotating in and out of our line of sight @xcite .",
    "the durations of the flares detected here , and their random arrival times and sense of circular polarization , point instead to a tangled and multi - polar field .",
    "thus , the conditions required for coronal coherent radio flares exist on long timescales , but the change in behavior may signal a shift in the field configuration on @xmath134 yr timescales .",
    "the inferred multi - polar nature of the field is again in good agreement with models of the @xmath10 dynamo , which suggest that the bulk of the energy is in the quadrupolar and higher order components .    unlike in the radio flares",
    ", we do find clear h@xmath1 periodicity ( @xmath164 hr ) , with a sinusoidal light curve that reveals the presence of a chromospheric hot spot , or an extended bubble , with a covering fraction of about @xmath3 .",
    "it is unclear whether this emission region is stable over timescales longer than about 1 day , but the decrease in peak flux between subsequent rotations may point to a transient nature that may be similar to the one now inferred in the radio band .",
    "the observed 2-hour period is well matched to the measured rotation velocity of , and indicates a rotation axis inclination of about 90 deg .",
    "the existence of such an extended structure provides additional support for a large - scale field that dominates the quiescent radio and x - ray emission .",
    "the general wisdom in the study of magnetic activity and its impact on the outer atmosphere is that the input of magnetic energy results in a series of related events that heat the corona and chromosphere and result in correlated x - ray , radio , and optical line emission .",
    "this idea is supported by observations of the sun , as well as various samples of early m dwarfs .",
    "the observations presented here show no clear evidence for any correlation between the various activity bands .",
    "in particular , the quiescent radio emission is over - luminous by nearly 4 orders of magnitude compared to predictions from the radio / x - ray correlation .",
    "similarly , the radio flares do not appear to correlate with the h@xmath1 variability . finally , it is possible that the x - ray flux incident on the chromosphere is not sufficient to produce the observed h@xmath1 luminosity ( particularly if we include the contribution from higher order balmer lines ) .",
    "* ultracool dwarfs exhibit clear evidence for intense magnetic activity that is not diminished compared to early m dwarfs .",
    "this activity is manifested most clearly in the centimeter radio band , but also in x - rays and balmer line emission .",
    "* both a chromosphere and a corona appear to exist , with luminosities relative to the bolometric luminosity that are in line with other objects of similar spectral type , and are significantly lower ( by @xmath165 orders of magnitude ) compared to early m dwarfs .",
    "* the dissipation of magnetic energy leads to intense radio emission , but it does not have a clear effect on chromospheric and coronal emission , both temporally and in terms of overall luminosity .",
    "the radio / x - ray correlation is violated by about 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "* the decoupling of magnetic dissipation ( as evidenced by radio emission ) from chromospheric and coronal emission may be due to changes in the structure and scale of the magnetic field or the outer atmosphere .",
    "this is possibly supported by the higher chromospheric luminosity compared to the coronal luminosity . *",
    "the presence of a steady large - scale magnetic field , as well as a multi - polar component , support current models of @xmath10 dynamos in fully convective stars .",
    "simultaneous multi - wavelength observations of several additional ultracool dwarfs are in progress .",
    "we expect that with this larger sample , and with the longer time baselines of our observations compared to typical studies , we can begin to address in detail the range of quiescent and variable activity , and the absence or presence of the correlations that appear to exist in the early m dwarfs .",
    "ultimately , these observations should reveal the energy and size scale of the magnetic field , and thus provide a detailed view of the magnetic generation process in fully convective stars .",
