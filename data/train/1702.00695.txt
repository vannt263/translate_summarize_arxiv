    "therefore , employing detailed fine - scale models which take material heterogeneities into account is crucial in order to obtain accurate and informative numerical results .",
    "however , the numerical simulation of entire large structural systems such as dams , bridge piers , and nuclear power plants by fine - scale models lead to an enormous number of degrees of freedom and a prohibitive computational cost",
    ". this has motivated researchers to develop different categories of multiscale computational frameworks , by which one can benefit from utilizing an accurate mechanical model in the analysis of a large engineering problem with a reasonable computational cost .",
    "multiscale analysis frameworks fall into two primary groups @xcite .",
    "the first group includes hierarchical multiscale models , in which a fine - scale problem , simulated by a continuous or discrete mechanical model , is coupled to a macro - scale problem generally simulated by fem .",
    "hierarchy of the computational framework is established through solving the macro- and fine - scale problems independently , while information flows between the scales during the analysis .",
    "the second category includes concurrent multiscale models , in which the problem domain is decomposed into two subdomains .",
    "one subdomain is treated as homogeneous continuum modeled by fem over which deformations are considered to be in the elastic range , while the other subdomain is modeled by the detailed fine - scale model of interest .",
    "these two subdomains are connected through appropriate constraints , and the two scales are solved simultaneously .",
    "multiscale homogenization is a hierarchical method which has been intensively investigated over the past decades .",
    "analytical homogenization methods were first developed to derive mathematical equations for the effective material properties of heterogeneous solids based on the exact solution of the fine - scale boundary value problems @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches are limited to elastic materials with simple periodic internal structures studied under small deformation fields .",
    "computational homogenization methods were then developed to conquer these limitations . in these multiscale frameworks , a representative volume element ( rve ) of the fine - scale material is constructed and assigned to each macroscopic computational point .",
    "the rve homogenized response is considered as the effective material behavior , and no specific constitutive equations are defined at the macro - scale . during each computational step , the macroscopic strain tensor at a fe gauss point is applied to the related material rve as boundary condition .",
    "next , the rve solution is used to calculate the homogenized stress tensor , which is then transferred back to the macroscopic computational point to continue the analysis .",

    "has been more investigated and praised compared to the computational efficiency .",
    "one of the major shortcomings of the classical homogenization methods , in which material rves are assigned to all macro - scale fes from the beginning of the analysis , is the tremendous computational expenses necessary to solve the boundary value problems at each integration point at separate scales during the analysis . in engineering problems dealing with fracture and failure in concrete structures , cracking and",

    "( 3 ) delaunay tetrahedralization of the generated aggregate centers and the associated three - dimensional domain tessellation are then carried out to obtain a network of triangular facets inside each tetrahedral element as shown in figure [ ldpm]b .",
    "figure [ ldpm]c illustrates a portion of the tetrahedral element associated with one of its four nodes @xmath1 and the corresponding facets . combining such portions from all tetrahedral elements connected to the same node @xmath1 , one obtains the corresponding polyhedral particle which encloses the spherical aggregate .",
    "two adjacent polyhedral particles interacting through shared triangular facets are depicted in figure [ ldpm]d .",

    "in addition , the following parameters are used in the ldpm facet constitutive equations : @xmath216 gpa , @xmath217 mpa , @xmath218 mpa , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 mm , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 mpa , @xmath229 .",

    "variation of the effective young s modulus and poisson s ratio with respect to the rve size is presented in figure [ e - nu ] .",
    "it is shown that the homogenized values of @xmath210 and @xmath211 converge to a plateau as the size of the rve is increased .",
    "regarding these curves , one can see that a 25 mm ( @xmath236 ) rve is an appropriate representative of the underlying material , and there is no need to further increase the rve size .",
    "the error bars that are shown on these curves indicate the standard deviation of the results due to different rve mesh realizations .",
    "results show that the homogenized elastic properties become independent of the particle distribution inside the rve , as @xmath237 increases .",

    "each loading case is carried out on a single hexahedral fe with one integration point coupled with a material rve . typical particle representation and geometry of each rve size",
    "are depicted in figure [ rvegeom ] .",

    "stress - strain results obtained from analyzing rves with different mesh realizations are averaged for each rve size and presented in figure [ averagesigma ] .",
    "figure [ averagesigma]a shows the homogenized nonlinear rve behavior under tension , in which it is clearly seen that the post - peak response becomes more brittle as the rve size is increased .",
    "meso - scale crack opening contour of the damaged rves at the end of the analysis are shown in figure [ rve - damaged - tens ] for different rve sizes .",
    "one can see that damage is localized in a narrow planar region of the specimen , which is the source of the size effect observed in figure [ averagesigma]a .",
    "effective rve response under hydrostatic and confined compressions are presented in figure [ averagesigma]b .",
    "the observed strain - hardening trend is due to the confinement effect , which leads to diffused micro - cracks over rve volume . on the other hand ,",
    "rve softening response under unconfined compression loading condition , as shown in figure [ averagesigma]c , is associated with the vertical splitting cracks generated due to the rve lateral expansion .",
    "figure [ rve - damaged - ucc ] presents the crack opening contour of the damaged rves , in which one can see multiple splitting cracks developed over the rve volume at the end of the loading process .",
    "it must be noted that the rve effective response under hydrostatic , confined , and unconfined compression is not dependent on the rve size , as presented in figures [ averagesigma]b and c. this is due to the fact that , on the contrary to the tensile fracture , damage is distributed throughout the specimen and does not localize .",
    "concrete , rock , and other quasi - brittle materials are characterized by strain - softening behavior , which leads to strain localization and stress redistribution .",
    "this means that damage tends to localize in a certain region of the material domain , while the rest of the material domain unload and/or remains in elastic regime .",
    "thus , assigning material rve to all finite elements that are used to discretize the macroscopic material domain is unnecessary , and it increases the computational cost tremendously .",
    "therefore , defining a criterion to determine which finite elements enter the nolinear regime and must be assigned with a material rve can be highly beneficial .",
    "this can be obtained by starting the analysis by considering elastic isotropic constitutive behavior for all fes , and without assigning rves to any macroscopic fe in advance .",
    "when a finite element meets a criterion , an rve is assigned to that finite element .",
    "next , the inserted rve is loaded to the level of the finite element strain tensor and is used as the element constitutive equation for the rest of the analysis . in the next section , an appropriate criterion is developed , then some numerical examples are solved to investigate the efficiency of the proposed adaptive homogenization framework .      the ottosen criterion , which is a combination of rankine and drucker - prager criteria , is widely used to analyze concrete behavior , and it is considered in this section .",
    "the ottosen criterion in the haigh - westergard space is stated as @xcite @xmath238 where @xmath239 and @xmath240 are the haigh - westergard space variables defined as @xmath241 where @xmath242 , @xmath243 , and @xmath244 are constants .",
    "@xmath245 is the first invariant of the stress tensor in which @xmath246 is the volumetric stress , and @xmath247 , @xmath248 , and @xmath249 are the principal stresses . @xmath250 $ ] is the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor , and @xmath251 is the octahedral shear stress .",

    "are considered , and for each case haigh - westergard space variables @xmath239 , @xmath240 , and @xmath254 are calculated and presented in table [ ottosen - param ] .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     a generic rve response under uniaxial tension and compression is depicted in figures [ ottosen]a and b. one can see that the stress strain curves consist of a linear elastic , nonlinear hardening , and softening post - peak parts .",
    "since linear elastic constitutive equation is assigned to all finite elements at the beginning of the analysis , the rve insertion criteria must be calibrated for the linear elastic domain .",
    "therefore , when the inserted rve is loaded to the level of finite element strain tensor , the homogenized stress tensor calculated from the rve is approximately equal to the element stress tensor obtained from elastic constitutive equations . in such a way",
    ", sudden changes of the system energy level , which might be due to the mismatch of macroscopic and homogenized stress tensors at that gauss point , are prevented .",
    "therefore , parameters @xmath259 and @xmath260 employed in calibrating the ottosen criterion are set to the tensile and compressive linear elastic limit stresses , as shown in figures [ ottosen]c and d , and are calculated as 2.35 and 20 mpa , at @xmath2626.7@xmath263 and @xmath2645.7@xmath265 , respectively . in addition",

    "it must be noted that @xmath261 and @xmath260 are calculated such that the stress values obtained from the rve response at @xmath270 and @xmath271 is less than 5@xmath272 different from the stress values computed by elastic constitutive equation at the same strain levels .",
    "the curves presented in figures [ ottosen]c and d are generated through nonlinear analysis of a 50 mm rve with ldpm parameters equal to the ones presented in section [ rve - elastic ] . since changing the rve size only affects the post peak behavior and has minor effect on the elastic response , as long as @xmath237 is large enough , the calibrated @xmath242 , @xmath243 , and @xmath244 do not change when a different rve size with the same ldpm parameters is employed .",
    "it should be noted that the elastic material properties assigned to the fes at the beginning of the analysis is computed by elastic analysis of the specific rve , which will be assigned to each fe meeting the criterion during the analysis , as explained in section [ rve - elastic ] .",
    "* adaptive multiscale homogenization procedure*. to clarify the computational strategy in the proposed adaptive homogenization framework , a simple concrete prism is modeled with 3 finite elements and is loaded under axial tension , as shown in figure [ 3elem ] .",
    "the numerical procedure can be described as follows :    1 .",
    "the effective young modulus @xmath210 and poisson s ratio @xmath211 of the chosen rve are calculated by elastic analysis of the rve as explained in section [ rve - elastic ] .",
    "the elasticity tensor @xmath273 is built by using the calculated effective elastic properties of the rve , and linear elastic constitutive equations @xmath274 are employed for all fes , as shown in figure [ 3elem]a .",
    "@xmath275 and @xmath276 are the rates of stress and strain tensors .",
    "the elastic constitutive equation is used for each fe until the calibrated criterion in equation [ ottosen ] is satisfied .",
    "once the stress tensor at the gauss point of a finite element calculated from the elastic constitutive equation meets the criterion , the element constitutive equation is switched from elastic constitutive equation to a meso - scale material rve , see figure [ 3elem]b .",
    "the fe strain tensor is applied on the assigned rve in order to load the rve to the current level of the fe stress tensor , and the analysis proceeds using the inserted rves as the finite element constitutive equation , see figures [ 3elem]c and d. it is important to point out that the rve size is such that its volume matches the one of the fe .",
    "this ensures correct energy dissipation and size effect under strain softening .    in figure",
    "[ 3elem]c , one can see that finite elements 2 and 3 unloads , while the finite element 1 enters the softening branch .",
    "considering figure [ 3elem]d , it is observed that damage localization occurs in the rve assigned to finite element 1 , while the cracks developed over the rves of the finite elements 2 and 3 close , as these finite elements unload .",
    "in this section , the four point bending problem is solved by the proposed adaptive multiscale homogenization , and the results are compared to the full fine - scale analysis of the same problem .",
    "a beam of 1250 mm length , 250 mm height , and 50 mm width is selected and modeled by both fem and ldpm , as shown figure [ 4pbt - geom]a .",
    "the same ldpm parameters listed in section [ rve - elastic ] are used in these simulations . for the homogenization problem ,",
    "solid finite elements of 25 mm size are used to discretize the macroscopic problem .",
    "in addition , a material rve of 25 mm size is constructed to be inserted into the adaptive homogenization framework during the analysis . the finite element size and the rve size",
    "are chosen to be equal in order to cover the same damaged area in both homogenization and full fine - scale analyses , which makes the dissipated energy to be equal in both simulations @xcite preserving correct energy dissipation and size effect @xcite .",
    "rve effective elastic properties are calculated as @xmath277 gpa and @xmath278 0.17 and are employed as macro - scale material properties in the adaptive framework . the beam is simply supported and is equally loaded by two loading platens located at 50 mm from midspan .",
    "the calculated force - displacement curves of the homogenization and full fine - scale analyses are plotted in figure [ 4pbt - geom]b .",
    "one can see that homogenization result agrees well with the fine - scale analysis in terms of both the slope of the linear part and the peak value .",
    "it is should be pointed out that the oscillations observed in the force - displacement response of the beams is due to fact that the simulations are performed with an explicit dynamic algorithm .",
    "figure [ 4pbt - damage]a shows the fes @xmath279 contour obtained from the homogenization framework at 0.1 mm displacement of the loading platens , corresponding to a pre - peak load level , see figure [ 4pbt - geom]b .",
    "these contour plots are comparable with the crack opening contours plotted at the same instant of the full fine - scale analysis , as shown in figure [ 4pbt - damage]c .",
    "one can see that the micro cracks generated in the full fine - scale analysis are diffused over the volume where positive @xmath279 is distributed in the multiscale homogenization analysis .",
    "the @xmath279 contour at failure obtained from the multiscale homogenization analysis is depicted in figure [ 4pbt - damage]b .",
    "the localized damage pattern is consistent with the crack opening contour of the full fine - scale analysis at failure plotted in figure [ 4pbt - damage]d .",
    "the homogenization framework successfully replicated the full fine - scale analysis results with respect to both the force - displacement response and the specimen damage distribution .    during the adaptive multiscale homogenization analysis ,",
    "the macro - scale finite elements that satisfy the rve insertion criterion are plotted in figure [ 4pbt - rveinsert ] sequentially .",
    "each subfigure corresponds to a point on the force - displacement curve shown in figure [ 4pbt - rveinsert ] .",
    "one can see that up to point ( a ) , all of the finite element are inside the linear elastic behavior envelope , and elastic constitutive equation is used for all of them . at point",
    "( b ) , sixteen finite elements have met the criterion , and a fine - scale material rve is assigned to each of those elements . as the analysis continues , more finite elements meet the criterion , which can be seen from figure [ 4pbt - rveinsert]c to [ 4pbt - rveinsert]f .",
    "it is interesting to note that up to the point ( f ) , the shape of the finite elements stack that met the rve insertion criterion corresponds to the distribution of the positive @xmath279 generated due to the beam bending as shown in figure [ 4pbt - damage]a .",
    "in addition , considering figures [ 4pbt - rveinsert]g and [ 4pbt - rveinsert]h , the selected finite elements at points g and h , that are placed on the post - peak branch , follow the beam localized damage pattern at failure as shown in figure [ 4pbt - damage]b .      an l - shape specimen subjected to a horizontal force",
    "is analyzed by both the full fine - scale particle model and the adaptive multiscale homogenization method .",
    "the generated specimens by fem and ldpm are presented in figures [ l - geom]a and b. the specimen is fixed at the left side in all directions , and is subject to a horizontal force by means of a loading plate at the top side .",
    "the same ldpm parameters listed in section [ rve - elastic ] are employed in these simulations .",
    "25 mm side hexahedral solid finite elements are used to discretize the macroscopic problem domain .",
    "similarly to the four point bending problem , the macroscopic fes and the constructed rve sizes are considered to be equal , and @xmath277 gpa and @xmath278 0.17 are the rve homogenized elastic properties that are assigned to the macro - scale finite elements .",
    "figure [ l - geom]c shows the force displacement curve of the loading plate obtained from the multiscale homogenization and the full fine - scale analyses .",
    "one can see that the homogenization result is in relatively good agreement with the full fine - scale analysis result with respect to both the slope of the linear part and the trend of the softening branch .",
    "there is approximately a 10@xmath272 difference in the force peak value , which is due to the coarse finite element discretization of the macroscopic domain in the multiscale homogenization analysis .",
    "the damage localization in the finite element analysis is constrained to follow the possible paths provided by the finite element discretization . in the current problem , due to the coarse and roughly structured finite element mesh",
    ", possible paths that are available for the strain localization band to develop are limited , which definitely influences the results . in the classical fe simulation of such problems ,",
    "the fe mesh can be refined to capture the correct localization path .",
    "however , in the homogenization analysis , the size of finite element mesh is constrained by the rve size as its lower limit , which , as discussed in section [ rve - elastic ] , must be larger than @xmath280 to properly represent the behavior of underlying material .",
    "therefore , numerical problems including sharp corners and inclined localization paths can be mentioned as a limitation of the homogenization framework .    the developed damage pattern in the multiscale homogenization and the full fine - scale analyses are presented in figure [ l - damage ] .",
    "one can see that the strain localization band obtained from the homogenization analysis approximately matches the crack opening contour captured by the full fine - scale simulation .",
    "the rve insertion sequence is plotted in figure [ l - rveinsert ] .",
    "one can see that up to point ( a ) shown on the force - displacement curve , no rve is assigned to any finite element , and the tensorial elastic constitutive equation is used for all elements . at point ( b ) , six finite elements meet the criteria , and their constitutive equations are switched from the elastic tensorial one to an rve assigned to their gauss points .",
    "the rve insertion sequence begins from the sharp corner of the specimen where stress concentration occurs .",
    "strain localization band initiates from this corner and propagates through the specimen . as the loading process continues ,",
    "more finite elements are equipped with a rve , and this can be observed as the red area in figure [ l - rveinsert ] spreads . in figure",
    "[ l - rveinsert]h , one can see that the developed red area at the end of the simulation encompasses the band of finite elements where damage localization takes place as shown in figure [ l - damage]a .",
    "the most significant feature of the proposed adaptive multiscale homogenization scheme is the fact that the fine - scale material rves are not assigned to all macroscopic finite elements from the beginning of the analysis , as opposed to the classical homogenization method .",
    "in addition , users are not required to specify the finite elements that must be assigned with a material rve in advance .",
    "the computational framework methodically detects the critical finite elements that must be inserted into the multiscale analysis . in the four point bending test problem ,",
    "206 finite elements out of the total 1,000 finite elements were enriched with the rves ( @xmath281 ) .",
    "out of the total 680 finite elements in the l - shape specimen problem , only 132 elements met the linear elastic limit criterion ( @xmath282 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the proposed adaptive scheme led to a significant computational cost saving . in figure",
    "[ comptime - compare ] , the total computational time of the full fine - scale simulations of the beam four point bending test and the l - shape specimen are reported as 180 hours and 23 hours on a single processor , respectively .",
    "with the same computational resources , it takes 64 hours ( 35@xmath272 of the full fine - scale computational time ) for the multiscale analysis of the four point bending test , and 12 hours ( 35@xmath272 of the full fine - scale computational time ) for the l - shape specimen test .",
    "another source of computational time saving is the initialization time .",
    "the full fine - scale beam generated by ldpm consists of 48,550 nodes and 240,740 tetrahedral elements , while the rve used in the multiscale analysis includes 163 nodes and 529 ldpm tetrahedral elements .",
    "similarly , the l - shape specimen consists of 31,165 nodes and 150,767 tetrahedral elements , while the fine - scale material rve is characterized by 154 nodes and 498 tetrahedral elements .",
    "therefore , the amount of time necessary to generate the rve mesh is negligible compared to the initialization time needed to generate the geometry of the full fine - scale specimens .",
    "in this paper a recently published multiscale homogenization method , which couples a fine - scale discrete model to a macro - scale continuum model , is implemented in an adaptive framework .",
    "an rve insertion criterion is defined based on the ottosen failure criteria widely used for the simulation of concrete behavior . on the contrary to the classical homogenization method",
    ", there is no need to assign any rve to any specific part of the macro - scale problem domain ahead of the analysis .",
    "the adaptive strategy automatically detects the finite elements that should be inserted into the homogenization framework .",
    "therefore , computational cost is considerably decreased with respect to the classical homogenization method due to less number of rves that are assigned to macroscopic finite elements .",
