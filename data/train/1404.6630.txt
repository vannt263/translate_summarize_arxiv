    "fluctuations of steps of monoatomic height on crystal surfaces have been studied quite extensively in the past nearly two decades , both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",

    "the theoretical approaches include langevin theory , scaling arguments , and monte carlo simulations . on the experimental side ,",
    "especially , scanning tunneling microscopy turned out to be a very effective tool in measuring the temporal evolution of step fluctuations .    for",
    "_ confined _ steps , fluctuations are affected by the presence of neighboring steps . fairly recently ,",
    "ferrari et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the dynamics of the border ledge of a crystal facet .",
    "motivated by this analysis , new characteristic fluctuation laws have been suggested , in particular , @xmath8 for periphery diffusion , and @xmath9 for evaporation  condensation @xcite . in subsequent theoretical and experimental studies",
    "@xcite periphery diffusion has been investigated .",
    "for instance , in monte carlo simulations for pd , the fluctuating step has been mimiced , in a toy model , by the one  dimensional solid  on  solid ( sos ) model , with the neighboring step having been assumed to be straight .",
    "the two steps interact through an effective , long ",
    "range interaction , the entropic repulsion @xcite . quite good",
    "agreement between results of the theoretical and experimental approaches has been reported @xcite .",
    "the aims of this article , presenting results of extensive monte carlo simulations on one  dimensional sos models , are as follows : ( 1 ) in case of isolated steps with pd , effects of slope and curvature of the steps as well as temperature on the characteristic exponent @xmath5 and on the prefactor of the corresponding power law for @xmath10 are investigated .",
    "finite - size and finite - time dependences are closely monitored , which had not been studied systematically in previous simulations .",
    "in addition , ec dynamics is simulated .",
    "( 2 ) in case of confined steps , the toy model will be reanalyzed for step fluctuations driven by pd .",
    "the previous monte carlo findings will be scrutinized .",
    "we also shall discuss briefly ec kinetics for the toy model and a modification , which have not been treated before in simulations .",
    "the outline of the article reflects these aims : following the introduction , we shall describe the sos models and monte carlo methods .",
    "thereafter , the main results will be presented , first for isolated and , then , for confined steps .",
    "the summary will conclude the article .",
    "a step of monatomic height on a crystal surface with the kink excitation energy @xmath11 may be described by a one  dimensional solid  on  solid ( or terrace",
    "kink ) model , with the hamiltonian    @xmath12    where the sum runs over all step sites @xmath2 , with the positions of the step atoms , @xmath13 , taking integer values . in the simulations , steps of finite length , @xmath14 , are considered . unless stated otherwise , we employed pinned boundary conditions , keeping @xmath15 and @xmath16 constant for all times @xmath3 , measured in monte carlo steps per site , mcs / s @xcite .",
    "for _ isolated _ steps , three different initial step configurations , @xmath17 , have been studied : ( a ) flat steps , with    @xmath18    \\(b ) tilted steps , with    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the slope of the step , pinning the steps at @xmath21 and @xmath22 for all times @xmath3 .",
    "( c ) ( circular ) curved steps , with    @xmath23    for steps pinned at @xmath24 , see fig . 1 .    for _ confined _ steps , fluctuations of the initially flat step , see case ( a ) , are restricted by the bordering second , non - fluctuating step at distance @xmath25 .",
    "thence , there is the constraint @xmath26 for all sites and times .",
    "the step fluctuations may be measured by the equilibrium correlation function    @xmath27    with @xmath28 being the number of active sites , i.e. @xmath29 for pinned boundary conditions ( and @xmath30 for periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "the brackets denote the thermal average .",
    "@xmath31 is a time , at which equilibrium has been reached .    in the monte carlo simulations , we study periphery diffusion and evaporation  condensation . for pd ,",
    "step atoms are allowed to move to neighboring sites , for instance , @xmath32 , while @xmath33 .",
    "in contrast to the kawaski dynamics , corresponding to pd , ec is realized by glauber kinetics , where at randomly chosen site @xmath2 one tries , randomly , to change the position of the step , @xmath13 , by @xmath34 ( detachment or evaporation ) or by @xmath35 ( attachment or condensation ) . as usual , the acceptance rate of the various moves is given by the appropriate boltzmann factor @xcite . to study finite  size effects , steps with between about 20 and about 400 sites",
    "were simulated . to equilibrate the steps ,",
    "at least the first @xmath36 monte carlo steps per site were discarded .",
    "typically , to obtain thermal averages , a few thousand independent equilibrium configurations were evaluated , with , for each configuration , a similar number of realizations , to compute the time evolution . in this way , one gets simulation data of high accuracy .",
    "indeed , errors bars are smaller than symbol sizes in the figures , and we refrained from displaying them .",
    "we first present results of monte carlo simulations on the time evolution of the equilibrium step fluctuations , @xmath10 , for _ isolated _ ( a ) flat , ( b ) tilted , and ( c ) curved steps , applying periphery diffusion for all types , and evaporation  condensation for flat and tilted steps .",
    "the steps are pinned at the ends , i.e. @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are fixed , to avoid , for ec , effects due the motion of the entire step @xcite .",
    "note that for curved steps , the equilibrium shape is not circular , as depicted in fig.1 .",
    "we are interested in the value of the characteristic exponent @xmath5 in the expected power ",
    "law for the growth of @xmath39 .",
    "using langevin theory and simulations , @xmath5 has been found to be 1/4 for fluctuations driven by pd and 1/2 in case of ec @xcite .",
    "the latter result follows from exact arguments as well @xcite .    to determine @xmath5 from simulation data , one may monitor the effective exponent @xmath40 , in its discretized form",
    "@xcite    @xmath41    with @xmath42 , where @xmath43 refers to the discrete time scale , measured in mcs / s .    indeed , after a diffusive",
    " like behavior , @xmath44 , at very short times @xcite , the effective exponent is observed to decrease monotonically rather rapidly to about 1/4 for pd , and to about 1/2 for ec , for flat , tilted , and curved steps , as illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . note that @xmath40 continues to decrease monotonically , approaching eventually zero , due to the fact that @xmath10 saturates for pinned steps of finite length .",
    "let us denote the time needed to pass through the characteristic value , @xmath45 1/4 or 1/2 , by @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 . that time depends on temperature , slope , curvature , and , perhaps , most interestingly , the length of the step .",
    "actually , we find strong evidence that @xmath48 , for sufficiently long steps , increases with @xmath49 in form of a power ",
    "law , @xmath50 , with @xmath51 being roughly 1.5 for ec and being roughly 0.5 for ec .",
    "steps with up to about 400 sites have been studied .",
    "the observed finite ",
    "size behavior suggests that @xmath10 satisfies the simple power ",
    "law , @xmath39 , asymptotically in time in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath52 .",
    "the prefactor , @xmath53 , in front of the asymptotic power ",
    "law for @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 , turns out to depend significantly on temperature and the type of the step,(a)-(c ) . to our knowledge , @xmath53 had not been analyzed in previous simulations of step fluctuations . to take into account finite  size effects",
    ", we consider the effective prefactor @xmath56    @xmath57    with @xmath5= 1/4 for pd and 1/2 for ec .",
    "@xmath28 is the number of active sites .",
    "the effective prefactor is found to have its , in general plateau  like , maximum , @xmath58 , at the time @xmath48 , at which the corresponding effective exponent @xmath40 passes through @xmath59= 1/4 , for pd , or 1/2 , for ec .",
    "the prefactor @xmath53 = @xmath60 is then reached for @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath58 displays an interesting and simple finite  size behavior , as illustrated , for pd , in fig .",
    "3 . for sufficiently long steps , @xmath58 is found to grow , for all types of steps , ( a)-(c ) , like @xmath62 , @xmath25 depending on temperature and on the type of step .",
    "thence , one may easily estimate the prefactor @xmath63 from the simulation data .    results of such extrapolations for initially flat steps at various temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "we compare our monte carlo findings to predictions of the langevin theory @xcite ,    @xmath64    with the step stiffness @xmath65 being    @xmath66    the step mobility @xmath67 follows , apart from a proportionality factor , from the fraction of successful monte carlo attempts . in fig .",
    "4 , we fixed this factor by equating the langevin predictions and the monte carlo findings at @xmath68 .",
    "obviously , we observe a very good agrement for the non  trivial temperature dependence of the simulated prefactor @xmath53 with the prediction based on langevin theory .",
    "it seems worthwhile to note that the prefactor @xmath53 increases monotonically not only with the temperature but also with the slope of the steps , @xmath69 , see fig .",
    "5 . consequently",
    ", it is significantly larger for curved than for flat steps .",
    "actually , @xmath53 is observed to depend essentially on the energy of the step .",
    "for instance , for tilted steps , we obtained    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the thermal equilibrium energy of steps with the slope @xmath20 .",
    "because of their pinning at the ends , the steps tend to fluctuate more strongly in the center , as we observed when monitoring the local fluctuations .",
    "of course , this boundary effect is expected to play no role in the limit of indefinitely long steps .",
    "we now consider fluctuating , initially flat steps with periphery diffusion , described by the one  dimensional sos model , eq.(1 ) , confined by a second step .",
    "the confining step is located at distance @xmath25 from the initial step position @xmath72 , i.e. for all times one has @xmath73 .",
    "a typical monte carlo equilibrium configuration for @xmath74 and periphery diffusion is depicted in fig .",
    "6 .    in previous monte carlo studies of this toy model @xcite ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions have been employed , considering pd at fixed temperature , @xmath75 , and step length @xmath76 . depending on the separation distance @xmath25 , three different regimes have been identified . for small @xmath25 , @xmath77 , the step fluctuations , @xmath10 , have been suggested to grow logarithmically with time . for sufficiently large distances ,",
    "@xmath78 , @xmath10 is found to behave as for isolated steps , where its power  law like increase is characterised by the exponent @xmath79 . in the intermediate range of @xmath25 , power  law dependences",
    "are observed , with the exponent @xmath5 being close to 2/11 , as may follow from theoretical descriptions for the dynamics of the border ledge of a crystal facet @xcite .",
    "however , deviations from the simple power  law have been found to occur , possibly , due to , for instance , crossover effects related to the separation distance @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "no simulations had been done for ec , where scaling arguments and langevin theory @xcite may suggest @xmath5= 2/5 , instead of 1/2 as for isolated steps .",
    "the aim of the present monte carlo study is to study the toy model in more detail , investigating , among others , finite  size effects , the deviations from simple - power laws and the long  time behavior of @xmath10 .",
    "mostly , we employed pinned boundary conditions .",
    "let us first deal with pd .",
    "in particular , we monitored the dependence of the effective exponent @xmath80 on step length , temperature , and separation distance . at first sight",
    ", one may distinguish three regimes , ( i)-(iii ) , see below , following and generalizing the previous analysis @xcite .",
    "examples are depicted in fig .",
    "7 .    in all cases , at very early times , @xmath10 exhibits , as for isolated steps , a diffusive  like behavior due to independent moves at randomly chosen sites , with @xmath40 near one .",
    "a much finer time resolution than the one shown in fig . 7 , would be needed to demonstrate that behavior .",
    "because of the step stiffness , the growth of the fluctuations then slows down @xcite , with @xmath40 decreasing more gradually and , always , monotonically .",
    "now , ( i ) the effective exponent may approach rather quickly zero , without any striking anomalies .",
    "this may happen when the steps are rather short , independent of @xmath25 , because @xmath10 saturates quite soon .",
    "this rather trivial effect is not displayed in fig .",
    "7 . it may also also happen for longer steps and fairly small @xmath25 , as depicted in fig .",
    "7 , possibly , due to the suggested logarithmic rise of @xmath10 @xcite . on the other hand , ( ii ) for sufficiently large values of @xmath25",
    ", @xmath10 seems to grow as for isolated steps , with @xmath40 being , in quite extended time intervals , close to 1/4 .",
    "the most interesting case is encountered for the intermediate regime ( iii ) , where , again for quite extended time intervals , one observes a power  law like behavior , with @xmath40 being close to 2/11 .",
    "certainly , for a more quantitative description , temperature will play an important role as well , as will be discussed below .",
    "clearly , in general , @xmath10 is expected to be , asymptotically , finite , in all three regimes of the toy model , with the corresponding fluctuation length @xmath81 being bounded by the distance @xmath25 . in any event ,",
    "it is of much interest to clarify the conditions , under which one may observe typical features of the three regimes ( i)-(iii ) .",
    "we checked , in regime ( i ) , whether there is evidence of the logarithmic growth of @xmath10 , which had been suggested to occur , as in a step train , for small @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we assumed the form @xmath82 and monitored the effective prefactor @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , for instance , for @xmath84 at @xmath85= 1.0 and @xmath86 , see fig .",
    "7 , the prefactor is found to be nearly constant in a quite large time range , measured in mcs / s , @xmath87 .",
    "eventually , it starts to decrease , due to finite  size saturation of the fluctuations .",
    "the time window increases with the length of the steps .",
    "we tend to conclude that the fluctuations satisfy , over a fairly large time interval , the logarithmic growth law .",
    "we note in passing that there is no indication of logarithmic behavior for small steps , where @xmath40 goes quickly to zero caused by the fast saturation of @xmath10 . at higher temperatures , regime(i )",
    "extends to a larger range of separation distances @xmath25 , as will be explained below .    obviously , in regime ( ii ) , where @xmath88 , the fluctuation length of isolated steps has to be small compared to the separation distance @xmath25 .",
    "for sufficiently long steps , it may happen in large time windows , see fig .",
    "7 , but asymptotically , @xmath89 , the growth of @xmath10 will be ultimately limited by @xmath25 .    in the , perhaps , most interesting regime of moderate distances @xmath25 , regime ( iii ) , we observe , again in intermediate time intervals , a power  law like behavior of @xmath10 , with exponent close to 2/11 for pd , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the value has been argued to reflect the long  range interactions of the fluctuating step with another step or an ensemble of other steps @xcite . indeed , in the toy model , the entropic repulsion with the straight step may cause such an interaction , tending to hinder the growth of the fluctuations and tending to reduce the value of the characteristic exponent , from 1/4 to 2/11 .",
    "before discussing the range of validity of this regime , it seems useful to monitor and analyze the fluctuation length @xmath90 in more detail . actually , @xmath91 is found to be related to the standard deviation of the histograms @xmath92 , describing the probability that the step position differs , after time @xmath93 , from its equilibrium value , at @xmath31 , by @xmath94 . more concretely ,    @xmath95    averaging over all active step sites @xmath2 .",
    "typical results are depicted in fig .",
    "8 at @xmath96 and @xmath86 , for different values of @xmath25 as well as for isolated steps .",
    "the simulation data are compared to the gaussian probability distribution with the standard deviation @xmath97 set equal to the fluctuation length @xmath90 . as seen from the figure",
    ", there is a very good agreement , with a very slight asymmetry in the simulation histogram for small @xmath25 , as expected due to the presence of the confining step .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that similar observations hold in general , including periodic boundary conditions as well .",
    "the criterion for encountering the unconventional effective exponent , @xmath98 , may be argued to be that , for sufficiently long steps , the fluctuation length @xmath99 of the corresponding isolated step is just somewhat smaller than @xmath25 , so that the entropic repulsion is strong enough to change the unconstrained fluctuations of isolated steps to those reflecting the presence of the second step .",
    "if the fluctuation length is too small , or if @xmath25 is too large , then one is in the regime of the fluctuations of isolated steps , ( ii ) . in the opposite case , regime ( i ) , remainders of the logarithmic growth are seen . following this consideration , the extent of regime ( iii ) depends , especially , on temperature .",
    "a few typical examples are : at @xmath100 and @xmath14 being about 100 to 200 , @xmath99 is , for @xmath3 ranging from 5000 to 20000 mcs / s , in between 2.5 and 2.7 , increasing with @xmath3 . at @xmath101 ,",
    "@xmath99 rises , in the same time window , from about 6.3 to about 7.5 .",
    "accordingly , the regime ( iii ) , where @xmath40 is , in a rather long time interval , near 2/11 , is expected to shift to larger distances @xmath25 at the higher temperature .",
    "we checked the suggestion by varying @xmath102 from 5 to 15 , at @xmath101 .",
    "now , the unconventional exponent , 2/11 , is , indeed , found to be quite pronounced at @xmath25 around 10 .",
    "thence , analysis of the correlation length for isolated steps will lead to reasonable choices of separation distances to encounter the unconventional growth in the fluctuations of confined steps .    as has been argued above , the power  law behavior of @xmath10 with the exponent 2/11 is not expected to occur asymptotically , @xmath103 , in the toy model for finite distance @xmath25 , because @xmath10 will be limited by @xmath25 , in contrast to the situation for isolated steps .",
    "the effective exponent , after having displayed a plateau  like behavior near 2/11 , continues to decrease monotonically , until it finally reaches zero . actually , we monitored , at fixed @xmath25 , the time needed to reach the , supposedly , characteristic value of @xmath104 , i.e. , @xmath105 , as a function of step length @xmath14",
    ". as had been mentioned above , the corresponding time @xmath106 for isolated steps is found to diverge as @xmath14 is going to infinity , showing that @xmath10 obeys , in the thermodynamic limit , a simple power  law asymptotically in time .",
    "now , for confined steps , the simple power ",
    "law describes only a _",
    "transient _ behavior . as shown in fig .",
    "9 , for @xmath74 and 5 , we obtain , to a good degree of accuracy , for sufficiently long steps @xmath107 , with a finite @xmath108 , reflecting the saturation of @xmath10 at finite time due to the presence of the second step in the toy model .    to observe , possibly , the characteristic value of 2/11 in the asymptotic limit , the second step may be placed at indefinite distance from the fluctuating step , with true , physical long  range interactions between the two steps .",
    "limits had to be taken in the appropriate order .",
    "note that at larger distances , @xmath25 , longer and longer runs would be needed to determine the limiting size  dependence , and we refrained from attempting to do it .    for ec , the positions of the fluctuating step tend to be repelled due the entropic repulsion exerted by the straight step .",
    "thence , in thermal equilibrium , for pinned boundary conditions , @xmath109 takes a curved form , somewhat similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "1 . the maximal height of the equilibrium shape , at given temperature and step length , increases with decreasing @xmath25 .",
    "for instance , for steps of length @xmath28= 199 at @xmath101 , as depicted in fig .",
    "7 , the maximal height increases from about 17 to about 33 , when lowering @xmath25 from 20 to 3 .",
    "then , already for small distances",
    "@xmath25 , as depicted in fig . 7 for @xmath110 ,",
    "the effective exponent @xmath40 does not fall off quickly , unlike in regime ( i ) for pd , with @xmath10 growing faster than logarithmically in the time span we studied . as shown in fig .",
    "7 as well , for moderate @xmath25 , @xmath111 , there seems to exist a time range in which @xmath10 displays a power  law like behavior with the effective exponent being close to 2/5 , as had been predicted for the border ledge of a crystal facet @xcite .    to avoid complications resulting from the curved equilibrium shape of the step positions , for ec ,",
    "one may modify the toy model by introducing another straight step , placed , symmetrically , at distance @xmath112 from the fluctuating step . for this variant ,",
    "@xmath40 exhibits similar features as those shown in fig .",
    "7 , adjusting the separation distance between the fluctuating and straight steps . in any event",
    ", the ec case with confinement may deserve further attention .",
    "perhaps , analytical calculations on the toy models would be feasible .",
    "they would be most welcome .",
    "we studied thermal fluctuations , @xmath10 , of isolated and confined steps of monatomic height on low  index crystal surfaces in the framework of one  dimensional sos models .",
    "periphery diffusion , pd , and evaporation  condensation , ec , have been analyzed , using monte carlo techniques .    for isolated steps",
    ", we found that @xmath10 grows asymptotically , i.e. for @xmath113 , in the limit of indefinitely many step sites , as @xmath55 . in the case of pd , the characteristic exponent @xmath5 is observed to be 1/4 , independent of slope and curvature as well as temperature of the steps .",
    "the prefactor @xmath53 , on the other hand , varies with the geometry and temperature , being determined by the energy of the step .",
    "the temperature dependence for initially flat steps agrees well with the one predicted by langevin theory . in the case of ec , the exponent @xmath5",
    "is found to be 1/2 , independent of slope and temperature .    for confined steps , we considered , following previous simulations , a toy model with an initially flat , fluctuating step in the presence of a second fixed , straight step , at initial distance @xmath25 .",
    "we mainly studied pd . for rather large steps ,",
    "we find , depending on @xmath25 , three different regimes , where @xmath10 shows , for quite extended time intervals , either a power  law like behavior or logarithmic growth .    the power  law like behavior may be due to unconstrained fluctuations as for isolated steps , with @xmath40 close to 1/4 or due to fluctuations hindered by the entropic repulsion of the confining step , with @xmath40 being near 2/11 . in all cases , fluctuations are found to satisfy a gaussian distribution .",
    "comparison of the standard deviation ( or fluctuation length ) of the isolated steps to the separation distance provides the clue to determine the range of validity of the various regimes with logarithmic or power  law like growth of @xmath10 .",
    "eventually , @xmath10 will be limited by @xmath25 , so that asymptotically , @xmath103 , the effective exponent @xmath40 will approach zero , for all finite values of @xmath25 .",
    "in case of ec , the effective exponent , due to entropic repulsion , may be expected to be 2/5 , as predicted by related scaling arguments and langevin theory . indeed ,",
    "a related power  law like growth of the step fluctuations seems to occur for suitable choices of distance @xmath25 , temperature , and step length .",
    "however , the simulations of the toy model are strongly affected by the fact that the average step position is not conserved for ec .",
    "further studies are desired for clarification .",

    "<S> the temporal evolution of equilibrium fluctuations for surface steps of monoatomic height is analyzed studying one - dimensional solid  on  solid models . using monte carlo simulations , fluctuations due to periphery  diffusion ( pd ) as well as due to evaporation  condensation ( ec ) are considered , both for isolated steps and steps confined by the presence of straight steps . for isolated steps , the dependence of the characteristic power  laws , their exponents and prefactors , on temperature , slope , and curvature is elucidated , with the main emphasis on pd , taking into account finite  size effects . </S>",
    "<S> the entropic repulsion due to a second straight step may lead , among others , to an interesting transient power  law like growth of the fluctuations , for pd . </S>",
    "<S> findings are compared to results of previous monte carlo simulations and predictions based , mostly , on scaling arguments and langevin theory . </S>"
