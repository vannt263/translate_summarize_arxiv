    "in linear optimization one wants to compute the maximum value of a linear objective function under linear inequality constraints .",
    "there exist many algorithms that solve lo problems by iteration .",
    "the classical algorithm is the simplex method , which produces an exact solution .",
    "it runs through the extremal points of the convex set that satisfies the constraints ( the feasible set ) , improving the value of objective function in each step , halting at an extremal point that produces the maximum value .",
    "the simplex method runs from one boundary point of the feasible set to the next .",
    "interior point methods run through the interior of the feasible set .",
    "historically , the first such method is the _ affine scaling algorithm _ ( afs ) method of dikin , which remained unnoticed until 1985 .",
    "the work of karmarkar  @xcite sparked a large amount of research in polynomial ",
    "time methods for lo , and gave rise to many new and efficient interior point methods ( ipms ) for lo . for a survey of this development",
    "we refer to the books of wright  @xcite , ye  @xcite , vanderbei  @xcite and roos _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "an ipm starts from an arbitrary initial point @xmath0 in the interior and constructs a sequence @xmath1 that converges to a maximum @xmath2 .",
    "an ipm is a dynamical system which solves the lo problem , provided that the @xmath3-limit of  @xmath0 consists of maxima of the objective function  @xmath4 .",
    "if there is only one such maximum , then the lo problem is called _ non - degenerate_. in this case , the ipm solves the lo problem provided that it converges to the maximum .",
    "any lo problem can be converted to a dual problem in which one needs to find the minimum value of a dual linear objective function under dual constraints . if @xmath4 is the objective function of the primal problem and if @xmath5 is the objective function of the dual problem , then @xmath6 for all feasible @xmath7 and all @xmath8 . to solve an lo problem it therefore suffices to close the duality gap and find @xmath9 such that @xmath10 . according to the minimax theorem , such @xmath9 exist and apart from a primal sequence @xmath1 most ipm s also produces a dual sequence @xmath11 , halting as soon as the duality gap @xmath12 reaches a value which is below the desired accuracy threshold .",
    "a primal problem that is non - degenerate may have a degenerate dual problem , in which case the orbit @xmath11 may have a non - trivial @xmath3-limit set .",
    "we will study such an lo problem at the end of this paper and find that the dual dynamical system contains a hyperbolic attractor .",
    "the simplex method runs from one extremal point to the next , but an ipm uses a variable step size  @xmath13 . for each feasible @xmath7",
    "the algorithm produces a vector @xmath14 such that @xmath15 is contained in the feasible set for @xmath16 and such that @xmath17 is in the boundary of the feasible set .",
    "the step size @xmath13 is fixed during iteration and is chosen @xmath18 so that the orbit @xmath1 is contained in the interior of the feasible set .",
    "an ipm therefore is a one - parameter family of dynamical systems .",
    "it is well known that an ipm may not converge if @xmath13 is too large .",
    "one of the best studied algorithms is the affine scaling method ( afs ) which was proposed by dikin and which has been further developed by vanderbei _",
    "@xcite it is known  @xcite that afs converges if @xmath19 and that it need not converge if @xmath20 , see  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that afs behaves chaotically in the dual variables for @xmath20 , as has been found by castillo and barnes  @xcite and mascarenhas @xcite .",
    "the previous studies of chaotic behavior in interior point methods were carried out for specific problems : one considers an lo problem , applies the algorithm and analyzes the resulting dynamical system . in this paper , we take a different approach .",
    "we consider the primal - dual afs that was proposed by jansen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . it has the nice property that it be presented in a such a form that its low order terms do not depend on the original lo problem . by ignoring the higher order terms",
    ", we obtain a one - parameter family of dynamical systems , which we call the _ dikin process _ , that is the same for all lo problems .",
    "of course , the dikin process is not an ipm anymore .",
    "however , the bifurcations that we establish for the dikin process are the same as the bifurcations that have previously been found by castillo and barnes for their specific lo problem .",
    "this indicates , experimentally and non - rigorously , that the chaotic behaviour of the dikin process represents that of general interior point methods .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first recall the primal - dual afs method for solving lo problems .",
    "we then derive the one - parameter family of dynamical systems , and analyze it for increasing values of a parameter @xmath21 .",
    "we show that the system behaves chaotically as @xmath21 increases beyond @xmath22 .",
    "we supplement this analysis experimentally by feigenbaum diagrams . in the final section ,",
    "we compare our results to an ipm that arises from a specific lo problem .",
    "we reserve the symbol @xmath23 for the vector of all ones . for a vector @xmath7 ,",
    "the capital @xmath24 denotes the diagonal matrix with the entries of @xmath7 on the diagonal .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath25 is a function and @xmath26 , then we denote by @xmath27 the vector @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 is another vector , then @xmath30 will denote the coordinatewise product of @xmath7 and @xmath29 and @xmath31 will denote the coordinatewise quotient of @xmath7 and @xmath29 . in other words , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "finally , @xmath34 denotes the @xmath35norm .",
    "in linear optimization , the notion of affine scaling has been introduced by dikin  @xcite as a tool for solving the ( primal ) problem in standard format @xmath36 the underlying idea is to replace the nonnegativity constraints @xmath37 by the ellipsoidal constraint [ ellips ] 1,where @xmath38 denotes some given interior feasible point , and @xmath39 the diagonal matrix corresponding to @xmath38 .",
    "the resulting subproblem is easily solved and renders a new interior feasible point with a better objective value .",
    "dikin showed , under the assumption of primal nondegeneracy , that this process converges to an optimal solution of @xmath40 .    every known method for solving @xmath40",
    "essentially also solves the dual problem @xmath41 by closing the duality gap between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which equals @xmath44 .",
    "our basic assumption is that a primal - dual pair @xmath45 of feasible solutions exists and that @xmath46 is an @xmath47 matrix of rank @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "a pair of feasible vectors @xmath50 solves @xmath40 and @xmath51 if and only if they are orthogonal . since @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    ", this means that the coordinatewise product @xmath54 is equal to the all - zero vector .",
    "the primal - dual afs method that we consider in this paper has been proposed by jansen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in primal - dual afs ,",
    "dikin s ellipsoidal constraint ( [ ellips ] ) is replaced by a constraint that includes both the primal and the dual variable :    [ ellips2 ] 1,where @xmath55 denotes the diagonal matrix corresponding to the slack vector @xmath56 . in this notation , @xmath57 is the original pair of primal vector and slack vector and @xmath45 is an updated pair .",
    "the differences @xmath58 and @xmath59 are called the primal - dual afs directions .    for non - negative @xmath60 let @xmath61 be the coordinatewise square root of the coordinatewise product and let @xmath62 be the coordinatewise power of @xmath14 . jansen _ et al .",
    "_  have shown that the directions @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be derived from the vector @xmath65 by first projecting @xmath66 onto the null space ( for @xmath63 ) and the row space ( for @xmath64 ) of @xmath67 , with @xmath68 , and then rescaling the result by a coordinatewise product . more specifically , if @xmath69 then @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the orthogonal projections onto the null space of @xmath67 and the row space of @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "these projections recombine in the dikin ellipsoid to [ sum ] x^-1x + s^-1s=- .",
    "this gives the primal - dual afs directions but not the size of the step , which is controlled by an additional parameter @xmath13 .",
    "it is known that the iterative process @xmath73 converges to a solution if @xmath74.@xcite this is of course a significant restriction on the step size , and primal - dual afs is not often used in practice .",
    "starting with a primal - dual feasible pair @xmath45 , the next iterated pair is given by @xmath75 and hence we have @xmath76 the vectors @xmath77 and @xmath78 are orthogonal .",
    "if the afs iterations are close to a solution , then @xmath77 and @xmath78 will be relatively small , and the product @xmath79 will be negligible . if we ignore the quadratic term , i.e. , if we assume that the coordinatewise product @xmath79 is equal to zero , then the reduction of  @xmath30 is proportional to  @xmath80 , which can be rewritten to @xmath81 observe that @xmath82 is equal to the left - hand side in @xmath83 .",
    "so if we ignore the quadratic term , and if we use equation  @xmath83 , then we find that @xmath84 recall that @xmath85 denotes the all - one vector , so we may also write this as @xmath86 now we have arrived at an iterative process for the product vector @xmath30 .",
    "since we require @xmath37 and @xmath87 , we need to require @xmath88 in the iterative process , and the maximal step size is equal to @xmath89 defining @xmath90 and writing @xmath91 we get @xmath92.\\ ] ] this iterative process depends on a parameter @xmath21 which is related to the original step size by @xmath93 . if @xmath94 has coordinates that are approximately equal ( in optimization one says that @xmath94 is ` close to the central line ' ) , then @xmath95 . in general ,",
    "@xmath96 .",
    "we make one further reduction . if @xmath97 for a scalar @xmath98 then @xmath99 , so the iterative process preserves projective equivalence .",
    "we may therefore reduce our system up to projective equivalence by scaling vectors so that their maximum coordinate is equal to one .",
    "if we consider vectors up to projective equivalence , then we obtain our _ dikin process _ : [ eq : scaled process ] ^k = w^ke -w^kw^k+1 = k=0 , 1 ,  the dikin process involves two steps : multiplication and scaling . to describe the process more succinctly we use the map @xmath100 .",
    "the dikin process is then given by : @xmath101 note that @xmath102 is a higher - dimensional analog of the logistic map on the unit interval .",
    "for each coordinate we apply the same quadratic map , and the only interaction between the coordinates is induced by the scaling .",
    "the dikin process does not solve the original lo problem .",
    "its significance derives from the fact that it does not depend on the lo problem and that its bifurcations can be analyzed in a standard way .",
    "we analyze the dikin process @xmath103 , for increasing values of @xmath21 .",
    "we suppress the subscript @xmath104 in @xmath103 and simply write the dikin process as @xmath105 note that @xmath4 has a global maximum @xmath106 and that we scale @xmath4 such that all coordinates take values @xmath107 .      if @xmath109 then the global maximum of @xmath4 is @xmath110 , which is outside the domain of our coordinates .",
    "the value of each coordinate increases during iteration . by monotonicity the limit of @xmath111 exists and it is a fixed point under iteration .",
    "the only fixed point is @xmath85 and therefore @xmath111 converges to the all - one vector  @xmath85 if @xmath109 .",
    "we now argue that @xmath85 remains the global attractor if @xmath108 . if @xmath112 then @xmath4 is unimodal and point symmetric with respect to its maximum @xmath113 : [ pointsym ] f(12+z)=f(12-z).under iteration of @xmath4 all orbits eventually end up in the interval @xmath114 $ ] . in particular , for every initial @xmath115 it eventually holds that @xmath116 .",
    "we need to show that @xmath117 in fact converges to @xmath118 if @xmath119 . by the point symmetry in ,",
    "if we replace the coordinates @xmath120 in @xmath111 by their reflections @xmath121 , then this does not affect @xmath122 .",
    "we may therefore assume that @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath124 .",
    "since @xmath4 is decreasing for @xmath125 we have that @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "therefore the minimum coordinate of @xmath122 is given by @xmath128 to prove that the process converges to @xmath85 , it now suffices to prove that @xmath129 , because this implies that the limit of @xmath130 exists and is equal to the unique fixed point of @xmath131 .",
    "now @xmath129 can be rewritten as [ cbc ] x^3-x^2 + 1 - 0 .",
    "the derivative @xmath132 of the cubic @xmath133 is negative on the unit interval , by our assumption that @xmath108 .",
    "so the cubic has its maximum at @xmath134 and its minimum at @xmath135 , which is a zero of the cubic .",
    "hence the inequality @xmath129 holds and we conclude that @xmath111 also converges to @xmath85 if @xmath136",
    ".      we will see that if @xmath137 , then the minimum coordinate and the maximum coordinate interchange under iteration , while all other coordinates either converge to the minimum of the maximum .",
    "we can thus ignore these other coordinates , and observe that the dikin process on the minim and maximum coordinate is given by @xmath138 , with @xmath131 as in  ( [ h ] ) .",
    "observe that a fixed point of @xmath131 produces a point of period two for this process .",
    "if @xmath139 then @xmath131 has a unique fixed point @xmath140 , which can be found by solving the cubic equation @xmath141 that we already encountered in equation  .",

    "we note that this particular limit behavior has also been observed by hall and vanderbei @xcite for the ( primal ) afs method .",
    "since all coordinates eventually increase above @xmath155 we may as well assume that @xmath156 .",
    "the minimum coordinate of @xmath157 then has value @xmath158 and the maximum coordinate has value @xmath159 .",
    "therefore , @xmath160 .",
    "if in fact @xmath161 , then we can restrict out attention to the mimimum and the maximum coordinate .",
    "this would be the case if @xmath162 , which leads us to the cubic equation @xmath163 the two roots of the quadratic are @xmath164 , and so we conclude that we may indeed restrict our attention to the minimum and the maximum coordinate if @xmath165 .",

    "this completes our computation and we conclude that if @xmath202 , then the @xmath3-limit is lebesgue a.e .",
    "equal to an orbit of period two .",
    "the coordinates of these periodic points are either equal to @xmath143 or @xmath118 .      for generic period doubling bifurcations in smooth dynamical systems , the parameter curve of the periodic points of period @xmath203 is parabolic and intersects the curve of the periodic point of period @xmath204 transversally . at the point of intersection ,",
    "the period @xmath204 point changes from stable to unstable , or vice versa .",
    "curiously , this scenario fails in at least the first two periodic doublings in our feigenbaum diagrams , in particular see figure  [ bifudiag ] .",
    "our numerical experiments show that the period two limit cycle persists beyond @xmath205 .",
    "it is indeed possible to prove that the period two point persist , but the analysis gets involved .",
    "we limit ourselves to the case that @xmath94 has three coordinates . assuming that the coordinates are ordered @xmath206 we can write    @xmath207    so we can describe the second iterate by the function @xmath208    this function preserves the diagonal , on which we have the two - dimensional process , which as we have seen already has a period two global attractor for @xmath209 .",

    "we expect @xmath217 to become unstable , splitting off a stable period @xmath218 point in a period doubling bifurcation , which is confirmed by the feigenbaum diagrams below . in our computational results for real lo problems , we find that the limit two cycle persists slightly beyond the threshold of @xmath214 .",
    "it is hard to extend the bifurcation analysis for @xmath220 , since the degree of the algebraic equations increases and periodic points can not be found in closed form .",
    "however , using the similarity between the dikin process and the logistic map@xcite @xmath221 , we can prove that stable periodic points of higher order appear if @xmath21 increases beyond  @xmath222 .",
    "in particular , we shall now show that if the critical point @xmath223 is @xmath48-periodic under @xmath224 then the dikin process has a locally stable @xmath48-periodic orbit , provided the number of coordinates @xmath225 .",
