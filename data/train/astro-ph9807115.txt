    "the time delay between multiple gravitationally lensed images can be used to measure the distance of high redshift objects , and thus is a useful estimator of the hubble parameter , @xmath4 .",
    "after many years of monitoring the lens 0957 + 561 , the time delay estimates for this system are finally converging on an accepted value .",
    "groups monitoring 0957 + 561 at optical wavelengths have detected a sharp variation in each image , and have found the optical delay to be @xmath5days ( @xcite , 1997 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . given the long controversy over the value of the delay ( for a history , see table 1 of haarsma  _ et  al . _",
    "1997 , hereafter paper  1 ) , it is important that the optical measurement be confirmed at radio wavelengths . the mit radio astronomy group has monitored the source at radio wavelengths from 1979 to 1997 and the final light curve data and time delay results are reported here .",
    "observations have occurred monthly at the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) very large array radio telescope ( vla ) since 1979 at 6  cm and since 1990 at 4  cm .",
    "the monitoring ended in december  1997 .",
    "all of the data were reduced in the manner described in paper  1 and lehr  _ et  al . _  ( 1992 ) . to determine the flux densities of the point images , it was necessary to subtract the extended structure in the field . at both 6 and 4  cm , this subtraction was difficult in the most compact vla array , d , thus there are gaps in the light curves for 4 months of every 16 month cycle . in addition , some observations in other vla arrays were excluded due to bad weather or poor subtraction of the extended structure .",
    "when the observations were made in a combination or non - standard array configuration , the data were analyzed according to the next largest standard configuration ( a , b , or c ) .",
    "the 6  cm data through december  1994 were presented in paper  1 .",
    "the remaining 6  cm data and all of the 4  cm data are given in tables  1 and 2 , and plotted in figure  1 .",
    "the light curve data are also available electronically through http://space.mit.edu/radio/papers.html .",
    "there are a total of 147 points in the 6  cm light curve , and 58 points in the 4  cm light curve . at 6  cm ,",
    "the flux density of the b image increased in 1995 , following the a image increase in 1994 .",
    "the current 6  cm feature has lasted longer than the similar feature around 1989 - 1991 , but the a image is now declining . at 4  cm ,",
    "the quasar is twice as variable as at 6  cm ( as a percentage of average flux density ) .",
    "also , the variations in the 4  cm light curves occur earlier than the corresponding features at 6  cm . both of these characteristics are consistent with multi - wavelength models and other observations of agn variability ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the well - sampled increase and decrease at 4  cm in 1994 - 97 has helped significantly in determining the radio time delay .",
    "when fitting for the time delay between the images , the difference in magnification between them must be properly taken into account . in past analyses of lensed light curves (",
    "including paper  1 ) , only two parameters were used in the fit : the time delay and a single flux ratio .",
    "conner , lehr , &  burke  ( 1992 ) , however , have pointed out that the magnification varies rapidly along the b image , causing the vlbi core and jet components to have different flux ratios , with the core ratio being larger . at the resolution of the vla , the beam includes both the core and the jet , and",
    "thus the flux ratio of the vla light curves @xmath6 is a composite of the core and jet values .",
    "the vla light curve is the sum of the jet ( which is constant in time ) , and the core ( which has both variable and constant components ) .",
    "there are then four physical parameters : the time delay @xmath7 , the flux ratio of the core @xmath8 , the flux ratio of the jet @xmath9 , and the amount of flux density due to the jet vs. the core , _",
    "@xmath10 for the b image .",
    "note that the core can contain both constant ( dc ) and variable ( ac ) components , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath11 . also , the dc part of the light curve is due to both the core and the jet , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath12 .",
    "press  &  rybicki ( 1998 ) discuss these issues in the context of the optical light curves of 0957 + 561 .",
    "they point out that the amount of constant flux due to the core ( @xmath13 ) is impossible to determine , since we may have not yet seen the variable part of the core ( @xmath14 ) go to zero .",
    "they show that on a fundamental level there are only three measureable parameters in a pair of lensed light curves , which may be cast as : the time delay @xmath7 , the core flux ratio @xmath15 , and the extra constant flux in the b image that does not occur in the a image , @xmath16 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath17 is the flux ratio of the variable component .",
    "it is useful to write @xmath18 in terms of the core and jet components of the radio images as @xmath19 and therefore @xmath20 where the dc core components cancel out .",
    "the value of @xmath18 can thus be estimated from the values of @xmath21 , @xmath15 , and @xmath22 . since in the case of 0957 + 561",
    "we have @xmath23 ( @xcite ) , the value of @xmath18 must be negative ; _ i.e. _ the a curve has a larger amount of constant flux than the core - ratio corrected b curve .",
    "the values of several of the above parameters can be estimated from observations without doing time delay fitting .",
    "garrett  _ et  al .",
    "_  ( 1994 ) compiled the information on the core flux ratio from vlbi and optical observations , and found the weighted average of these estimates to be @xmath24 . also , the faintest portions of the vla light curves set upper limits on the jet flux density , i.e. @xmath25  mjy at 6  cm , and @xmath26  mjy at 4  cm . a better estimate of @xmath21 can be obtained by comparing coincident vlbi and vla observations .",
    "the vlbi observations give the core flux density at a particular epoch , which can be subtracted from the vla flux density to obtain the vla jet flux density .",
    "campbell  _ et  al .",
    "_  ( 1995 ) report vlbi observations at 6  cm on 1987  sep  28 and 1989  sep  26 , and by comparing these to vla observations occurring on the same days we find @xmath27  mjy and @xmath28 .",
    "the values for @xmath15 , @xmath22 , and @xmath29 can be combined using equation  [ eq.c0 ] to find @xmath30  mjy .",
    "the above estimates are all for the 6  cm light curves . at 4  cm",
    "there are no coincident vlbi / vla observations , so we can not make similar estimates .",
    "the value of @xmath18 is different at 6  cm and 4  cm due to the difference in @xmath21 ; note that the ratios @xmath22 and @xmath15 are the same for the two bands . for a synchrotron spectrum",
    ", @xmath21 will be smaller at 6  cm than 4  cm , and thus we expect @xmath31 to be smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "to fit for the three parameters @xmath7 , @xmath15 , and @xmath18 ( described in  [ parameters ] ) , we used the prh@xmath0 statistic ( press , rybicki , &  hewitt 1992a , 1992b ; @xcite ; incorporating the modifications of @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the dispersion statistic ( @xcite , 1996 ) , which were described in paper  1 .",
    "we used linear units ( mjy ) rather than the logarithmic units defined in paper  1 . the discrete correlation function ( @xcite )",
    "did not find a strong correlation in the 4  cm light curves , so that statistic was not used here .",
    "gaussian monte carlo data were made as described in paper  1 , but now with the four physical parameters @xmath7 , @xmath15 , @xmath22 , and @xmath21 .",
    "five hundred gaussian monte carlo data sets were used to estimate the 68% confidence intervals on the results for the real light curves , where the fitted @xmath18 values were compared to the input parameters using equation  [ eq.c0 ] .",
    "the pseudo - jackknife test from paper  1 was used to test the stability of the result to the removal of individual points .    to determine whether neglecting the difference between the core and jet flux ratio caused an error in our previous analysis , we applied the two dimensional fit ( for @xmath7 and @xmath6 , as in paper  1 ) to the gaussian monte carlo data made with four parameters .",
    "the resulting fitted - minus - true values did not show a significant bias ( to long or short delays , for example ) , but did show an increase in scatter about the true delay .",
    "we found that the error in the delay increased monotonically with @xmath21 , from roughly 20  days for @xmath33  mjy to roughly 100  days for @xmath34  mjy ( the value for the real light curves ) when using the prh@xmath0 statistic and the 6  cm monte carlo data .",
    "the same test with the 4  cm monte carlo data , and with the dispersion statistic at both 4  cm and 6  cm , revealed a similar but somewhat milder effect , with the delay error at least doubling between small and large values of @xmath21 .",
    "this dependence on the amount of flux density in the jet component may be one cause of the inconsistency in delay estimates over the years , and we caution that fitting for only two parameters may introduce significant errors .",
    "in addition to analyzing the two wavelengths individually , we also fitted for the parameters using both wavelengths at once .",
    "the dispersion and prh@xmath0 statistics are both easily modified for this by minimizing the sum of the statistics from each wavelength ( see press  _ et  al . _",
    "1992b ) , and fitting for the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath15 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "monte carlo analysis was also done for the joint data , where the 6  cm and 4  cm monte carlo sets were constructed with the same set of [ @xmath7 , @xmath15 , @xmath22 , @xmath21 ] .    the covariance model ( paper 1 ; press  _ et  al . _",
    "1992a ) used for the prh@xmath0 statistic was found by an iterative procedure on the individual light curves .",
    "first , measurement errors of 2% were assumed and used to make point estimates for the structure function , and then fitted to an exponential in the lag range of 100 to 700 days .",
    "this structure function was then used to determine the prh@xmath38  value for the light curve , and the measurement errors were adjusted until prh@xmath38  equaled the degrees of freedom",
    ". then the process was repeated for the new measurement error value .",
    "iterations stopped when the square root of ( prh@xmath38/degrees of freedom ) changed by less than 1% when prh@xmath38was calculated with the measurement error of the previous iteration . at 6  cm , the covariance model found was @xmath39 with measurement errors @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the time lag between two points on the curve . at 4  cm ,",
    "the fitted covariance model was @xmath43 with measurement errors @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the sharp feature in the b image at 6  cm in spring  1990 is statistically inconsistent with the rest of the light curve ( see paper 1 ) , and , given the short delay found from the optical and 4  cm light curves , the a image shows that the feature is not intrinsic to the source .",
    "thus we expect that the results with the points removed will be more accurate than the results for the full 6  cm curves .",
    "the 6  cm analysis was done both with and without the four points ( 1990  march  15 , april  10 , may  7 , and may  23 ) ; the light curve without the points will be denoted @xmath46 cm .",
    "the main results of the time delay analysis are shown in tables  3 and 4 .",
    "these and other aspects of the results are worth discussion in this section .",
    "first , the monte carlo analysis showed that the use of the three parameter fit ( @xmath7 , @xmath15 , @xmath18 ) made the time delay confidence interval independent of @xmath21 ( rather than increase with @xmath21 as happened in the two parameter fit described in  [ methods ] ) .",
    "next , the pseudo - jackknife test ( see paper  1 ) , using either the prh@xmath0 or dispersion statistic , showed that removal of an individual point from the light curve general caused a change in the delay that was much smaller than the confidence interval , with a few important points in the curve ( typically during rises or falls ) causing a change at about the amount of the confidence interval .",
    "thus , the delay estimate in all cases is stable under the removal of individual points .",
    "note also that the removal of the four spring  1990 points ( @xmath46 cm vs. 6  cm in tables  3 and 4 ) never caused a change in the fitted parameters of more than the confidence interval .",
    "the relationship between the values of @xmath18 and @xmath15 for a given delay is worth pointing out .",
    "figure  2 shows the prh@xmath38  statistic as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath15 for the @xmath46 cm light curves , with the delay fixed at the best fit value . the surface is a diagonal trough , with the location of the minimum poorly constrained along the bottom of the trough .",
    "the trend is such that a larger value of @xmath15 requires a more negative value of @xmath18 , as expected from equation  [ eq.c0 ] .",
    "the 4  cm light curve has a similar prh@xmath38  surface , and the dispersion surface shows a similar but even more pronounced effect .",
    "thus , if either @xmath15 or @xmath18 is poorly constrained by the light curves , the other parameter will also be poorly determined .",
    "there is a significant bias in @xmath18 and @xmath15 for the dispersion statistic , which is related to the interdependence of these parameters .",
    "the fitted - minus - true values from the dispersion analysis of the gaussian monte carlo data showed a pronounced asymmetry and bias in both @xmath18 and @xmath15 ( but was nearly symmetric and un - biased in delay ) .",
    "tests showed that the bias in @xmath18 and @xmath15 was somewhat reduced for @xmath47  days ( where @xmath48 is a weighting parameter in the dispersion statistic , see paper  1 ) .",
    "we continued to use @xmath49  days ( as done by @xcite ) , since that value had the narrowest distribution for the fitted - minus - true delays .",
    "thus , only the time delay results are given in table  4 .",
    "the prh@xmath0 statistic produced a symmetric distribution in @xmath18 and @xmath15 , and the results are listed in table  3 .",
    "note that the fitted value of @xmath18 is more negative when @xmath15 is larger , as mentioned above .",
    "the analysis of the individual wavelengths found somewhat different values of @xmath15 , and that @xmath36 is more negative than @xmath35 contrary to the predictions of  [ parameters ] .",
    "the joint analysis of the two wavelengths , however , used all of the available information to constrain the fit , and the resulting @xmath15 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are in good agreement with the predictions of  [ parameters ] .",
    "turning now to the results for the delay , it is of interest that all of the delay estimates in tables  3 and 4 are much smaller than the value of 540  days found by press  _ et  al . _  ( 1992b ) using the first 80 points in the 6  cm light curve .",
    "as explained in paper  1 , this change in the delay estimate is due entirely to the addition of new features to the light curve .",
    "if the first 80 points in the curve ( with or without the four spring  1990 points ) are fitted for the three parameters , the dispersion statistic finds a delay of roughly @xmath50  days , and the prh@xmath0 statistic ( using the above covariance model , eq .",
    "[ eq.cstruct ] ) finds a delay of roughly @xmath51  days ( the confidence intervals were estimated from monte carlo analysis of 100 light curves ) .",
    "therefore the change in the delay estimate between the first 80 points and the current 147 points occurs for both statistical methods , for fits with two or three parameters , and for a variety of covariance models .",
    "it does not , however , occur in our gaussian monte carlo data . comparing delay estimates from the first 80 points and the full curves in the monte carlo data , we find that 99% of the sets have a difference in delay less than the 75 day difference seen in the real light curves .",
    "thus the monte carlo light curves must still be missing some characteristic of the real data .",
    "a related issue is the difference in the delay estimates for the two wavelengths ( for prh@xmath0 , @xmath52  days vs. @xmath53  days , a difference of about three confidence intervals ) .",
    "the time delay between lensed images should be completely independent of wavelength , and indeed the optical and radio estimates come remarkably close .",
    "this effect also does not occur in the gaussian monte carlo data , which were constructed such that the 6 and 4@xmath54  data have the same set of [ @xmath7 , @xmath15 , @xmath22 , @xmath21 ] .",
    "when applying the prh@xmath0 statistic , we found that 99% of the monte carlo curves had a difference of ( @xmath55 ) that was smaller than the 55  day difference in the real data ; similarly , the dispersion statistic found that about 80% of the data sets had a smaller delay difference .",
    "since both of these effects ( the significant change in the delay estimate as features are added to the curves , and the significant difference between the two radio wavelengths ) are not seen in the monte carlo data , there must still be some systematic effect that has not been taken into account in the creation of the monte carlo data or in our analysis .",
    "one source of the systematic error may be interstellar scintillation , which can cause variability at a level not much larger than our observational error of 2% , perhaps creating small features such as the discrepancy between the 6  cm a and b images in early 1985 ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "although individual features of a few percent are difficult to identify , they may cause a significant bias in the delay estimate if they occur at crucial times in the light curves .",
    "we note that microlensing could cause similar low level systematic effects in the optical light curves ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since it is beyond the scope of this paper to model these systematic effects , we make a rough estimate from the difference between the 6 and 4@xmath54  delay estimates , giving a systematic uncertainty of roughly @xmath56  days for prh@xmath0 and @xmath57  days for the dispersion .",
    "note that this uncertainty is still less than 10% , and is only one factor contributing to the error in @xmath4  ( see  6 ) .",
    "note also that the optical time delay estimate has a smaller error ( only 1%,@xcite ) primarily because the source varies much more rapidly at optical wavelengths than radio wavelengths .",
    "we caution others monitoring gravitational lenses that in order to determine an accurate time delay it is preferable to have light curves with multiple features at multiple wavelengths , since the estimate of the time delay based on a single feature at a single wavelength could easily be corrupted by these low level systematic effects ( as the 0957 + 561 6  cm curves were after the first 80 observations ) .",
    "the 0957 radio light curves will continue to be a useful data set for studying systematic effects and time delay analysis techniques .",
    "figure  3 shows the prh@xmath0 and dispersion statistics as a function of delay for the joint analysis of the 4  cm and @xmath46 cm curves , with the values of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath15 fixed at the best fit values .",
    "figure  4 shows the aligned light curves at the two wavelengths with the prh optimal reconstruction ( see press  _ et  al . _  1992a and paper  1 ) .",
    "since our last report ( paper  1 ) , the b image has increased at 6  cm , and the a image has entered a slow decline .",
    "the 4  cm curves , given here for the first time , are highly variable and give additional features to aid in determining the time delay . to take into account the difference in magnification of the core and jet components of each image , we have fit for the delay , core flux ratio , and the excess flux density in the b image ( as defined by @xcite ) .",
    "the delay estimates found from the wavelengths individually disagree by a few confidence intervals , indicating that there are systematic effects not modeled in our analysis .",
    "the delay estimates found from the joint analyses of both wavelengths were @xmath1  days for prh@xmath0 and @xmath58  days for the dispersion , where the uncertainty is based on a rough estimate of the systematic error .",
    "both results are consistent with the delay estimated from optical monitoring ( @xmath3  days , @xcite ) , and thus we now have good agreement for the value of the delay from both statistics in both the radio and optical light curves .",
    "consensus has finally been reached on the value of the delay for gravitational lens 0957 + 561 .",
    "this measurement of the delay can now be used to answer cosmological questions .",
    "the hubble parameter , however , depends not only on the delay but also on the lens model and the galaxy velocity dispersion . using the spls model of grogin &  narayan ( 1996a , 1996b ) , the recent keck velocity dispersion measurement of 279kms^-1@xmath59 ( @xcite ) , and a time delay of 409  days",
    ", we obtain @xmath4=67kms^-1mpc^-1@xmath60 . in fitting this model , grogin &",
    "narayan used the ground - based optical position of the lensing galaxy as a constraint , rather than the more precise vlbi position .",
    "since then , the hst optical position of the lensing galaxy has been found to agree with the vlbi position ( @xcite ) .",
    "the modelers point out ( @xcite ) that if the vlbi position is used as the model constraint , their model fit is very similar to that of falco , gorenstein , &  shapiro ( 1991 ) ; for the same delay and velocity dispersion , the falco  _ et  al .",
    "_  model gives @xmath4=41kms^-1mpc^-1@xmath60 .",
    "thus , the change in the position of the lensing galaxy causes a change in the estimate of @xmath4  well beyond the statistical error , apparently in contradiction to the conclusions of kundi  _ et  al . _  ( 1997 ) regarding the robustness of the @xmath4  determination .",
    "new modeling work must be done which incorporates the improved galaxy position , the recent observations of the cluster mass distribution ( @xcite ) , a careful treatment of the systematic errors in the velocity dispersion ( @xcite ) , and the recently reported structure at x - ray ( @xcite ) , optical ( @xcite ) , and radio ( @xcite ; @xcite ) wavelengths .",
    "these new observations will allow an improved fit of the model to the data and provide a more accurate measure of the hubble parameter .",

    "<S> the gravitational lens 0957 + 561 was monitored with the very large array from 1979 to 1997 . </S>",
    "<S> the 6  cm light curve data from 1995 - 1997 and the 4  cm data from 1990 - 1997 are reported here . at 4  cm , </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic source variations occur earlier and are twice as large as the corresponding variations at 6  cm . </S>",
    "<S> the vlbi core and jet components have different magnification factors , leading to different flux ratios for the varying and non - varying portions of the vla light curves . using both the prh@xmath0 and dispersion statistical techniques , we determined the time delay , core flux ratio , and excess non - varying b  image flux density . </S>",
    "<S> the fits were performed for the 4  cm and 6  cm light curves , both individually and jointly , and we used gaussian monte carlo data to estimate 68% statistical confidence levels . </S>",
    "<S> the delay estimates from each individual wavelength were inconsistent given the formal uncertainties , suggesting that there are unmodeled systematic errors in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we roughly estimate the systematic uncertainty in the joint result from the difference between the 6  cm and 4  cm results , giving @xmath1  days for the prh@xmath0 statistic and @xmath2  days for the dispersion statistic . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with the current optical time delay of @xmath3  days , reconciling the long - standing difference between the optical and radio light curves and between different statistical analyses . </S>",
    "<S> the unmodeled systematic effects may also corrupt light curves for other lenses , and we caution that multiple events at multiple wavelengths may be necessary to determine an accurate delay in any lens system . now that consensus has been reached regarding the time delay in the 0957 + 561 system , the most pressing issue remaining for determining @xmath4is a full understanding of the mass distribution in the lens . </S>"
