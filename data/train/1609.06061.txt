    "quantum chemistry has for the last fifty years placed tremendous emphasis on solving the molecular electronic structure problem but the nuclei in molecules also move .",
    "observing these moving nuclei is at the heart of high resolution spectroscopy and their energy levels also provide the means of quantifying a wealth of thermodynamic properties via the partition function.@xcite traditionally nuclear motion was treated using perturbation theory based on harmonic vibrational motion and rigid rotational motions .",
    "this model provides much of the language of spectroscopy and approaches based on it are continuing to be developed , for example through use of quartic force fields @xcite and vibrational second - order perturbation theory ( vpt2 ) @xcite .",
    "however , the harmonic - oscillator rigid - rotor model is firmly rooted in the notion of small amplitude motion about an equilibrium geometry so must be limited in its region of applicability : it must break for all systems as they are excited towards dissociation .",
    "nuclear motion methods based on direct solution of the time - independent schrdinger equation are increasingly being used to compute rotation - vibration energy levels for a range of states up to and even above dissociation for important small molecules .",
    "while such computations used to require a national supercomputer,@xcite they can now be performed on a good workstation.@xcite increasingly nuclear motion calculations are becoming the primary source of information on small molecules as the results of these calculations are competitive with or , in some cases , more reliable than measurements . in this context",
    "i note that the value for `` spectroscopic accuracy '' of 1 @xmath0oft - quoted by theoreticians appears to have been chosen more for quantum chemical convenience than because it is true , or indeed useful , value .",
    "rotation - vibration spectra can only be considered to be high resolution at accuracies approaching 0.01 @xmath0 , a value i would suggest should be used for `` spectroscopic accuracy '' . this perspective will discuss situations where theory is competitive with or replacing observation as the primary source of data .",
    "in other words will address situations where first principles calculations are replacing experiment for key data because either they can be computed more accurately or are too difficult to measure reliably . in this context i note that if one is providing computed data for use in models or other applications then it should also be incumbent on the provider to also supply some estimated associated uncertainty of these data @xcite .",
    "the perspective will also mention some key areas in small molecule spectroscopy where high accuracy remains a distant goal .",
    "the nuclear motion methods used to solve spectroscopic problems are generically known as variational methods .",
    "this is because , at least in their early implementations , they involved obtaining direct solutions of the nuclear motion schrdinger equation using suitable basis functions to represent the wavefunction . within the limitations of the born - oppenheimer ( bo )",
    "approximation , these solutions are variationally exact for a given potential energy surface ( pes).@xcite the name variational has stuck even though many codes now adopt the grid - based discrete variable representations ( dvrs ) to represent the vibrational wavefunctions.@xcite dvr methods are not strictly variational and can show convergence from below,@xcite but have proved robust and reliable in practical calculations .",
    "development and improvement of these methods continues apace@xcite and the whole area of high accuracy treatment of nuclear motion calculations has been dubbed the fourth age of quantum chemistry.@xcite    for the purposes of this perspective i will take small molecules to mean ones containing up to five atoms . for these systems ,",
    "use of variational nuclear motion methods almost always means that the errors arising from these nuclear motion calculation reflect the underlying inaccuracy of the pes employed and , possibly , issues with the bo approximation .",
    "i will consider in turn the small but growing number of cases were full _",
    "ab initio _ treatments are providing benchmark accuracy ; the more standard case which makes use of experimental data to help provide accurate results ; finally i consider future prospects and , in particular , states around the dissociation limit and the link with chemical reactions . before doing this i will outline the various motivations for performing such calculations .",
    "like others , i originally started performing nuclear motion calculation to test potential energy surfaces .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy can obtain transition frequencies with exquisite precision@xcite and therefore provides a stringent test of potentials .",
    "for some time now , this process has routinely been treated as an inverse problems with nuclear motion calculations used to determine spectroscopically - accurate pess using observed data.@xcite this procedure is now the main source of high - accuracy pes and has got to the point that the most accurately determined geometry for the water molecules comes from a refined pes;@xcite other structural determinations are also increasingly relying on high accuracy theoretical calculations.@xcite    even without the need for refining the pes , variational nuclear motion calculations have been used to predict@xcite and assign@xcite spectra .",
    "they have also been used to probe the fundamental behaviour of molecules revealing the clustering of energy levels at high rotational angular momentum@xcite , the rearrangement of the levels around the monodromy point which occurs when a bent molecule becomes linear,@xcite and the quantal behavior of classically chaotic systems.@xcite more recently such calculations are playing a role in guiding observations of processes important for fundamental physics such as a possible change in the proton - to - electron mass ratio.@xcite    explicit summation of energy levels can be used to give temperature - dependent partition functions and other thermodynamic properties such as the specific heat.@xcite these data can be combined to give equilibrium constants as a function of temperature.@xcite for high temperatures , typically @xmath1  k , experience shows that it is necessary to include , at least approximately , all states in the summation and that this can give results that differ significantly than those based on summing levels from simpler models.@xcite methods are available which help to avoid the need to actually explicitly compute all the levels.@xcite in a similar fashion , the wavefunctions can be used to provide thermal averages of various properties.@xcite        in the area of astrophysics , cold interstellar clouds are well - known to be a reservoir of cold molecules and unusual chemistry .",
    "high - level theoretical methods are now being used to aid the prediction and detection of of exotic interstellar species.@xcite such calculations also yield accurate dipole moments which are necesary for abundance determination and often not known empirically .",
    "molecules , however , are also important in hotter bodies such as the atmospheres of planets , exoplanets , brown dwafs ( `` failed stars '' ) and stars cooler than our sun . in these bodies radiative transport through these atmsopheres , which may be much hotter than the earth s , plays a crucial role in determining its properties .",
    "a ground - breaking study was made by jrgensen _",
    "@xcite in 1985 ; they computed an extensive , if not accurate by modern standards , list of spectral lines for hot ( 2000 k ) hcn .",
    "they showed that use of this line list in a model atmosphere of a cool carbon star made a huge difference : extending the model of the atmosphere by a factor of 5 , and lowering the gas pressure in the surface layers by one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "subsequent calculations on water showed it has a similar line blanketing effect in oxygen - rich cool stars.@xcite this has led to the computation of extensive line list of transitions for hot molecules by a number of groups.@xcite recent work has particularly focussed on providing line lists for hot methane,@xcite the use of which have also been shown to have a dramatic effect on models of astronomical objects , @xcite see fig .",
    "[ tdwarf ] although the driver for computing hot line lists has largely been astronomical applications , there are actually many terrestrial applications in areas such as combustion , enviromental monitoring and plasma discharge studies for which they are also routinely being used .",
    "these line list can also be used to give other properties such as cooling functions @xcite and radiative life times of individual states.@xcite they also can form the input to models of electric - field interactions with polar molecules such as strong - field induced ro - vibrational dynamics and optoelectrical sisyphus cooling.@xcite    while much attention is focused on the calculation of energy levels and hence transtition frequencies , most practical applications also require transition intensities .",
    "as discussed below , the provision of transition intensities is becoming an increasingly important reason for performing nuclear motion calculations .",
    "since the pioneering work of kolos and wolniewicz @xcite , h@xmath2 has always provided the _ ab initio _",
    "benchmark for high - accuracy spectroscopic studies .",
    "recent theoretical calculations on the frequency of the fundamental vibration of h@xmath2 agrees with observation within their mutual uncertainty of @xmath3 @xmath0.@xcite this work demonstrates what is needed for the precise _ ab initio _ determination of ro - vibrational energy levels .",
    "it transpires that the non - relativistic problem can be solved equally accurately using a direct fully - nonadiabatic approach @xcite or using the more traditional bo separation approach of solving the frozen geometry electronic structure problem@xcite augmented by diagonal ( adiabatic)@xcite and off - diagonal ( non - adiabatic)@xcite corrections to the bo approximation . rather remarkably , the current largest source of uncertainty is the treatment of quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) effects;@xcite in this it echoes high precision calculations on the isoelectronic helium atom.@xcite the spectrum of h@xmath2 provides another probe of possible electron - to - proton mass variation@xcite , a phenomenon whose strength is sensitive to terms which arise from bo breakdown .    for diatomic systems high - accuracy studies are increasingly becoming based on the use explicitly - correlated gaussians to treat",
    "both the electronic and nuclear motion simultaneously.@xcite however , this methodology has yet to make significant impact in polyatomic systems , even ones with containing few electrons such as h@xmath4 . here a more pragmatic model based on high - accuracy electronic structure calculations using explicitly - correlated gaussians@xcite and a simplified treatment of non - adiabatic effects using effective vibrational and rotational masses@xcite has been found to provide excellent predictions of ro - vibrational transition frequencies@xcite and intensities@xcite .",
    "this work demonstrated the importance for high accuracy of both using an extensive grid of points in the electronic structure calculation and being careful in how they are fitted to the functional form used to represent the pes.@xcite the subsequent focus in these studies has been on including the effects of quantum electrodynamics@xcite and improving the treatment of non - adiabatic effects.@xcite the recent high - precision spectra recorded for h@xmath4 and its isotopologues@xcite will in due course serve as benchmarks against which improved _ ab initio _ procedures can be tested .    ; as reported by kemp _",

    "while improving the accuracy with which _ ab initio _ calculations can predict measured high resolution spectra of h@xmath4 and its isotopologues has made steady progress , the problem of treating the spectrum of these species near dissociation remains unsolved .",
    "the dense and complicated near - dissociation spectrum of h@xmath4 and its isotopologues was systematically recorded by carrington and co - workers for a decade starting in 1983.@xcite figure  [ h3+diss ] shows a small ( 0.12 @xmath0 ) region of the near - dissociation spectrum of h@xmath4 illustrating the density of lines and their variable widths , which reflects the different decay lifetimes of the various states .",
    "this spectrum was recorded by monitoring by the dissociation of the molecular ion into h@xmath2 + h@xmath5 and thus records transitions to temporarily bound states sitting above dissociation .",
    "attempts to model these spectra quantum - mechanically have so far given little insight into the underlying physical processes involved and certainly provide nothing approaching any line assignments.@xcite    before moving to larger systems it is worth mentioning the intriguing h@xmath6 system . this four - electron ion does not provide a benchmark for accuracy but instead provides a fundamental fluxional system in which the atoms freely interchange even at energies easily probed by spectroscopy .",
    "the stable ch@xmath6 ion provides a similar system.@xcite .",
    "accurate representation of the rotation - vibration states of h@xmath6 and its multiple isotopically - substituted forms has proved very challenging . in particular , new methods of treating the ro - vibrational symmetry of these fluxional systems",
    "have had to be developed.@xcite .",
    "obtaining reliable analytic fits to a pes which shows ten@xcite energetically - accessible stationary points have proved difficult.@xcite these systems display unusual spectroscopic properties @xcite and new methods for treating the nuclear motion problem have been developed.@xcite work on these fluxional system is far from complete .",
    "the stand form for storing spectroscopic data is usually referred to as a line list . a line list comprises two components : ( a ) a list of energy levels which can be used to give transition frequencies and ( b ) a list of transition probabilities . for very large lists",
    "it is recommended that these are stored separately to minimize disk usage.@xcite for both energies and intensities , calculations start from electronic structure calculations giving an initial _ ab initio _ pes and dipole moment surfaces ( dms ) .",
    "there is increasing evidence that best results require the consideration of effects , such as qed,@xcite which are usually considered to be too small to be important for chemically important molecules .",
    "furthermore , even if the pes only provides a starting point for a fit to spectroscopic data , these fit improve fairly systematically as the _ ab initio _ model used as the starting point is improved .    the basic procedure for systematically improving _ ab initio",
    "_ is the use of the focal - point analysis ( fpa ) @xcite or closely - related variants . in this procedure a base ( focal point ) calculation",
    "is performed at some high but affordable level of theory .",
    "the magnitude of the effects neglected or approximated in focal point calculation are corrected for individually by performing additional calculations .",
    "these calculations consider effects such extrapolation to the complete basis set limit , core correlation , high - order correlation , scalar relativistic effects , qed correction , spin - orbit effects and corrections to the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "the top - up calculations are performed using a mixture of larger ( variational ) calculations and perturbation theory as is appropriate for each effect .",
    "examples are given in the papers cited elsewhere in this perspective.@xcite of course , for simpler systems with fewer electrons , more of these effects can be included in the base calculation ; for example starting from an all - electron calculation eliminates the need to consider separately correlation of the core electrons .",
    "nuclear motion calculations on _ ab initio _",
    "pes s for systems containing more than h atoms rarely reproduce observed transition frequencies to much better than 1 @xmath0.@xcite however there are well - worked procedures for improving the pes by fitting to spectroscopic data.@xcite features of these procedures include the use of the hellmann - feynman theorem to avoid having to compute derives of the energy with respect to parameters of the pes by numerical finite differences , the inclusion of rotationally excited states as fits to vibrational energy levels alone are prone to give false minima in the fit,@xcite and the use of the initial _ ab initio _ points to constrain the fit @xcite which helps to stop the pes from becoming unphysical in regions where it is not determined by the available experimental data .",
    "spectroscopically determined pes s are capable of reproducing the observed data with accuracies approaching 0.01 @xmath0 .",
    "there are residual issues with how to deal with issues arising from failure of the bo approximations with some fits simply using a single pes to represent all isotopologues@xcite and others explicitly considering non - bo terms as part of the fit.@xcite    finally , for larger molecules , where it can be difficult to employ large enough basis sets to fully converge the nuclear motion calculation , some of this convergence error is either knowingly or unknowingly absorbed into the spectroscopically determined pes .",
    "such effective pes s have been found to be very useful,@xcite but , of course , can not straightforwardly be used with other basis set parameters or indeed other nuclear motion programs .    for the dms",
    "the strategy is somewhat different and it is usual to simply use a high - quality _ ab initio _ surface . indeed",
    "the evidence is that this produces better results than empirical fits,@xcite although care must be taken to base the surface on a sufficiently high quality electronic structure calculation.@xcite and an appropriate , dense grid of points.@xcite dipole moments can usually be computed as expectation values of a given wavefunction but can also be calculated using finite differences between energies perturbed by a small electric field .",
    "the hellmann - feynman theorem shows that these two methods are equivalent for exact wavefunctions .",
    "high accuracy tends to favor use of finite differences despite the extra computational cost : the finite difference method is more accurate but , perhaps more importantly , as an energy - based method it allows small corrections to the dms to be introduced along the lines of the fpa procedure used for pes.@xcite",
    "as mentioned above there is a major demand from astrophysics and elsewhere of comprehensive lists of transitions for hot species important in the atmospheres of cool stars and extrasolar planets .",
    "many of these species are closed shell polyatomic molecules composed of elements such h , c , o , n and s. my own exomol project @xcite has already produced more than 20 such line lists , see tennyson _",
    "@xcite for a review of the current status .",
    "other groups notably from reims@xcite and nasa ames,@xcite are also computing line lists for hot species , with more experimentally driven line list being provided by bernath and co - workers @xcite amongst the theoreticians is a certain consensus on how best to perform such calculations .",
    "there are reviews available detailing how to compute accurate rotation - vibration line lists,@xcite so here i will just give brief examples which illustrate strategic issues .",
    "figure  [ hooh ] illustrates the results achievable by comparing the computed spectrum of h@xmath2o@xmath2 with measured spectra currently available in the hitran database;@xcite the main source of spectroscopic data for atmospheric models .",
    "the apty h@xmath2o@xmath2 variational line list @xcite is based an empirically adjusted version of a high quality _ ab initio _",
    "pes @xcite and a completely _ ab initio _ dms @xcite .",
    "it contains around 20 billion transitions and is designed to be complete for wavenumbers up to 6000 @xmath0  and temperatures up to 1250 k.    o@xmath2 at wavenumbers higher than 1500 @xmath0 . ]",
    "thie perspective gives little about the nuclear motion programs employed in the calculations .",
    "this is because these programs generally give very precise solutions to the nuclear motion problem and , when inter - comparisons have been performed , the codes have been shown to give the same results for a given pes @xcite or dms.@xcite however , hot molecules probe many vibrationally and rotationally excited levels and the resulting lists of transitions between these levels can be huge .",
    "programs have therefore had to be adapted to cope with both the numerical and computational demands of these calculations.@xcite in particular my group has developed methods of using graphical processing units ( gpus ) to accelerate the computation of the many billions of transitions needed.@xcite the speed - ups from this approach are large and should aid studies on larger molecules , such as hydrocarbons beyond methane , which are thought to be important in the atmospheres of hot jupiter exoplanets .",
    "s generated using the aty2 line list @xcite .",
    "note how the depth of the minima ( windows ) decreases monotonically with temperature . ]",
    "the line lists generated to model the spectroscopic behavior of small molecules are so large because as the temperature rises the number of states involved in transitions grows rapidly .",
    "tests on methane @xcite showed that good results illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tdwarf ] could only be obtained by retaining 3.2 billion out just under 10 billion transitions provided by the full 10to10 line list .",
    "this meant the explicit consideration of transitions four orders - of - magnitude weaker than the standard intensity cut - off used by the hitran database .",
    "figure  [ h2s - t ] shows the temperature dependence of the absorption spectrum of h@xmath2s as modelled by the ayt2 line list @xcite which contains 114 million vibration - rotation transitions computed using an empirically - adjusted pes @xcite and an _ ab initio _",
    "dms.@xcite the shape of the spectrum changes significantly with temperature as the transitions involving highly excited rotational states and vibrational hot bands act to smooth out the sharp peaks and troughs observed at low temperatures .    to avoid leaving the impression that accurate results can be obtained in all cases , it should be noted that inclusion of a transition metal atom , even in a diatomic molecule , makes solution of the electronic structure problem very much harder . as discussed at length elsewhere,@xcite limitations on the accuracy of the _ ab initio _ potential functions in this case",
    "makes it difficult to use such calculations in a truly predictive fashion .",
    "extensive line lists , which contain tens of billions of transitions may be useful for astrophysics where observations are rarely made at very high resolving power . however , remote sensing studies of our own atmosphere are often made at resolutions approaching that obtainable in the laboratory .",
    "frequencies from variational nuclear motion calculations are rarely able to match these accuracy requirements but the same is not true for computed transition intensities .",
    "it is much more challenging experimentally to measure precise , absolute transition intensities ; the success of remote sensing missions such oco2@xcite demands more precise transition intensities than are available in standard data compilations such as hitran 2012.@xcite    theory has long provided transition intensities for species , such h@xmath4 , for which measurements were not available.@xcite recently , however , it has become apparent that it is possible to predict transition intensities to within 1  %  or better based on the use of high accuracy _ ab initio _",
    "dms @xcite and the judicious use of wavefunctions from variation nuclear motion calculations.@xcite one major advantage of this approach is that transition intensities for isotopically substituted species can be computed with some confidence at a similar level of accuracy .",
    "thus , for example , recent calculations have provided transition intensives for the important , radio - active trace species o@xmath7co with what can be assumed to be same accuracy as those computed for the main , o@xmath8co , isotopologue.@xcite    the _ ab initio _ computation of precise transition intensities requires some adaption to standard procedures used for both electronic stucture and nuclear motion calculations .",
    "in particular it is becoming apparant that the calculation of accurate dipole moments requires more extending the treatement of correlation by , for example , using larger reference spaces in multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) treatments.@xcite .",
    "for reliable results it is important dipole moment surfaces are smooth @xcite and that reliable surfaces can only be obtained by using very extensive grids of points.@xcite .",
    "an uncertainty quantification procedures@xcite has been developed for transition intensity calculations based on calculations with multiple pes and dms.@xcite i would expect use of this procedure to become more widespread .",
    "finally , i note that the use of computed transition dipoles for modeling electric - field effects requires retention of the phase information in the dipoles.@xcite this information is lost when the dipoles are used to compute einstein a coefficients or transition intensities , which are the standard quantities stored in data compilations .",
    "changes to compilations of theoretical transition information are therefore needed to accommodate for this use .",
    "the discussions above have essentially concentrated on spectra at infrared ( or possibly visible ) wavelengths for molecules with thermally occupied levels . however , there are circumstances where it is desirable to move beyond this region , not least because not all observed spectra are thermal in origin.@xcite laboratory rotation - vibration spectra of water have been observed in the near ultra - violet@xcite and there is increased interest in the atmospheric consequences of absorption by ro - vibrational excitation of water at even shorter wavelengths than this.@xcite there are variational line lists which cover these wavelengths@xcite but tests show that while it is possible to obtain reasonable predictions for transition frequencies with a good pes , it is hard to get reliable predictions for the transition intensity.@xcite it would appear that this problem is associated with difficulties in obtaining a suitable dms function . in particular other studies have already shown that computed transition intensities are sensitive the fit of the dms to the _ ab initio _ data even at visible wavelengths @xcite , and that calculations of these high overtone transitions require care with the numerics.@xcite so far , despite use of extended grids of _ ab initio _",
    "dipoles , a satisfactory fit has not been found the water dipole moment which allows the stable computation of transition intensities for the nine or ten quanta overtone transitions that occur at ultraviolet wavelengths .    moving further up the energy levels , boyarkin , rizzo and co - workers",
    "performed a series of multi - photon experiments which probed rotation - vibration levels of water below @xcite , above @xcite and , indeed , at dissociation @xcite .",
    "these experiments have the major advantage over the near - dissociation experiments on h@xmath4 that their multiphoton nature both greatly simplifies the resulting spectrum and makes the assignment of the rotational quantum numbers to the final state relatively straightforward .",
    "variational calculations on the bound levels gives good general agreement @xcite with the observations although the differences increase markedly just below dissociation suggesting that the pes in this region is less accurate than at lower energies .",
    "thus far global water potentials have not included the effect of spin - orbit coupling @xcite , which is known to be unimportant at low energies @xcite but almost certainly becomes significant near dissociation .",
    "theoretical studies of the spectra above dissociation remain more preliminary.@xcite    the ability to compute levels above dissociation raises a direct link not only with photodissociation but also with reactive scattering at low energies .",
    "the idea of using variational rotation - vibration calculations extending above the dissociation limit as a basis for theoretical studies of cold and ultra - cold reactions is currently being explored within my group.@xcite",
