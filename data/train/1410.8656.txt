    "several existing and upcoming experiments with highly charged ions confined in penning traps @xcite rely on effective mechanisms for cooling of the ions motions @xcite . past theoretical studies",
    "@xcite have investigated resistive and sympathetic cooling @xcite of highly charged ions under these conditions , but the interpretation of the sparse existing data is still subject of lively discussion .",
    "more data is required to validate simulations and assist in designing future experiments .",
    "we have performed systematic measurements of resistive and sympathetic cooling with highly charged carbon and oxygen ions confined in a penning trap .",
    "these were preceding steps to the measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the bound electron performed at the university of mainz , germany in collaboration with gsi , darmstadt , germany @xcite , but have not been evaluated and explained so far .",
    "we discuss the results and explain them in the framework of a dedicated energy - transfer model which relates the ion - ion interactions and ion - trap interactions to the energy reservoirs and the rates of energy transfers between them .",
    "the experimental setup and the procedures have been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "briefly , an arrangement of cylindrical penning traps is located in the homogeneous field of a superconducting magnet and is cooled to liquid helium temperature .        for the present discussion",
    ", it is sufficient to realize that ensembles of highly charged ions are produced in the cryogenic trap arrangement by electron impact ionization of atoms sputtered from a target by the same electron beam , in close similarity to the charge breeding process in electron beam ion traps @xcite .",
    "the ions are then confined for the experiments to be performed . in the absence of ion - ion interactions",
    ", each individual ion would perform an oscillatory motion consisting of three eigenmotions , two in the radial plane which is perpendicular to the magnetic field used for confinement , and one axial oscillation about the trap center and parallel to the experimental axis ( trap axis ) . in a cloud of interacting ions ,",
    "these eigenmotions are perturbed and the overall behaviour of the cloud is much more complicated . yet , the axial and radial oscillatory motions can be detected non - destructively which is used to perform charge - to - mass spectrometry of the trap content .",
    "pure ion clouds can be produced by resonant ejection of unwanted ions from the trap .",
    "the number of confined ions is determined from the spectral width of a bolometric detection signal @xcite and is presently of the order of a few hundreds of ions and below .",
    "ion loss due to collision or charge exchange with neutral species has not been observed thanks to residual gas pressures below @xmath0hpa @xcite .",
    "the detection of the ion motion , its cooling and non - destructive mass spectrometry of the trap content are performed by resonant pickup of image currents induced in trap electrodes , as will be discussed below .      in an ideal cylindrical penning trap",
    ", a single confined ion obeys the axial equation of motion @xmath1 where the axial oscillation frequency @xmath2 follows from the axial trapping potential @xmath3 according to @xmath4 such that for the present geometry the frequency of axial oscillation @xmath2 is given by @xmath5 here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the electric charge and mass of the ion , respectively , @xmath8 is the trap voltage constituting the potential well for axial confinement , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the axial and radial extensions of the trap , and @xmath11 is a geometry factor which is explained in detail in @xcite . in the present case we have @xmath12 and for ions such as hydrogen - like carbon @xmath13c@xmath14 ,",
    "the axial oscillation frequency @xmath2 is of the order of @xmath15mhz .",
    "the radial oscillation frequencies @xmath16 ( magnetron frequency ) and @xmath17 ( perturbed cyclotron frequency ) are not of interest in the following , since only the axial motion is directly excited , cooled and detected in the experiment .",
    "when the axial trapping potential is harmonic , like the one given by equation ( [ harm ] ) , the axial oscillation frequency of a single ion is independent of the energy ( amplitude ) of this motion .",
    "if terms of orders other than @xmath18 are present , the oscillation frequency becomes energy - dependent , as has been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "in real traps , this is always the case and usually efforts are undertaken to minimize these effects by appropriate choice of the trap geometry and the applied voltages @xcite . in the present case , excitation of the axial ion motion to an energy of 10ev per charge leads to an ion oscillation amplitude of a few mm , an average ion number density of order 10@xmath19/cm@xmath19 and a 10@xmath21 relative shift of the axial oscillation frequency , as will be discussed in detail below .",
    "the mechanisms of resistive cooling have been explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "briefly , an ion induces image charges in all surrounding trap electrodes @xcite .",
    "when electrodes are connected by a resistance , the axial ion oscillation produces an oscillatory current through the resistance which dissipates energy from the oscillation , hence reducing the axial oscillation energy @xmath22 of the ion .",
    "commonly , a tuned resonance circuit with an impedance @xmath23 is used to provide a resistance for cooling of the axial motion at @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ( presently @xmath26 ) is the quality factor and @xmath27 the inductance of the circuit . the quality factor",
    "@xmath28 provides large @xmath29 and hence efficient cooling , but limits the range of oscillation frequencies which can be cooled to a characteristic value of @xmath30 around @xmath31 . figure [ x ] depicts the relevant quantities , where the spectral distributions of an ion cloud and of a resonance circuit are shown .",
    "experimentally , we choose @xmath24 by setting the trapping voltage @xmath8 to an appropriate value .     of a resonant circuit .",
    "in our experiment we choose @xmath24 . ]    note , that in general the shape of @xmath32 is a complicated function which includes the interaction with the confined ions @xcite , but for the present experimental parameters we may ignore this",
    ".    the resistive cooling may be modelled by a friction force which depends on the axial ion velocity d@xmath33/d@xmath34 , the equation of motion then reads @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the cooling rate . in principle",
    ", the presence of a finite cooling rate ( friction ) changes the oscillation frequency according to @xmath37 , but in the present situation with @xmath38 this may be neglected ( see also further discussion below ) . here ,",
    "as already in equations ( [ harm ] ) and ( [ pott ] ) we also neglect the influence of the induced image charge on the confining potential , as for a single ion the effect becomes significant only under extreme conditions @xcite .",
    "for such a weakly damped oscillator , the solution of equation ( [ vier ] ) within an oscillation period @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where e is the ion kinetic energy at the center of oscillation .",
    "in general , the induced current from a single ion is at any time given by @xmath41 where the effective trap size @xmath42 contains all the information about the location and the geometry of the electrodes connected by the circuit with respect to the center of the ion oscillation .",
    "it is defined as @xmath43 , i.e. the endcap distance @xmath44 divided by a geometry factor @xmath45 , which has been explained in detail in @xcite . at present , with the lower correction electrode connected against a common ground ( see figure [ set ] ) , we have @xmath46 mm .    following equations ( [ motio ] ) and ( [ i ] ) ,",
    "the current induced by an oscillating ion reads @xmath47 this induced current @xmath48 is an oscillatory quantity of frequency @xmath2 and hence unqualified for an effective description over time periods as long as cooling time constants @xmath49 .",
    "we therefore retreat to a current value time - averaged over a period of oscillation @xmath50 and regard its evolution with advancing cooling time .",
    "we define this effective current @xmath51 by @xmath52 which by use of equation ( [ ii ] ) reads @xmath53 the use of the kinetic energy at the center of oscillation @xmath54 as an energy measure requires the ion energy to remain nearly constant over a period of oscillation ( weakly damped oscillator ) , hence the cooling rate @xmath36 needs to be much smaller than the oscillation frequency , @xmath55 . presently ( as common for such experiments ) , this is well fulfilled as @xmath56ms ) , where 780khz is the measured axial oscillation frequency and 105ms is the cooling time constant @xmath57 of a single ion under the present conditions .    in this picture",
    "we may say that the power dissipated from the axial ion motion into the cooling circuit is given by @xmath58 , hence the axial energy of the ion obeys the differential equation @xmath59 and follows an exponential decay of the kind @xmath60 where @xmath36 is the single - ion cooling rate , the inverse of which is the single - ion cooling time constant @xmath61 which , for the present example of @xmath13c@xmath14 , amounts to @xmath62ms at @xmath63m@xmath64 .",
    "note , that equation ( [ i ] ) assumes that the induced charge difference between the electrodes connected by the resonant circuit depends linearly on the axial coordinate of the ion .",
    "this , however , is not necessarily always the case , and higher - order ( odd ) terms may arise , leading to a current also at odd harmonics of the axial oscillation frequency .",
    "this has been discussed in detail in @xcite , but may be ignored for the present geometry .",
    "we also note that strictly , the axial energy @xmath22 even of a single ion undergoes fluctuations on the time scale of the cooling time constant due to the coupling to the thermal heat bath of the resistor and its electronic noise temperature .",
    "this , however may be ignored when looking at ion excitation energies of several ev as compared to the heat bath at a temperature of few kelvin .",
    "when ensembles of ions are considered , the situation is more complicated due to the larger total number of degrees of freedom , charge effects and the presence of ion - ion interaction , hence , for larger numbers of ions , sophisticated simulation methods have to be implemented @xcite .",
    "we first take a look at the extension of the above equations for @xmath65 ions . in full similarity to equation ( [ aver ] ) , for the effective current induced by @xmath65 ions we write @xmath66 where the first term on the right hand side is in analogy to equation ( [ nine ] ) given by @xmath67 the quantity @xmath68 ( two times the mean kinetic energy ) represents the total ( kinetic plus potential ) energy of @xmath65 ions .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of equation ( [ strom ] ) is zero for reasons of symmetry when @xmath65 is sufficiently large and the phases are distributed randomly . in this case , in analogy to equation ( [ str ] ) we write the differential equation @xmath69 and find the @xmath65-particle cooling rate @xmath70 identical to the single - particle cooling rate @xmath36 in equation ( [ cool ] ) .",
    "hence , the effective energy of an uncorrelated ensemble of @xmath65 independent ions is cooled at the same rate as a single ion .",
    "the same result has been obtained from similar arguments in @xcite and @xcite . a detailed derivation and discussion",
    "can also be found in @xcite .    if , however , we assume @xmath65 identical ions which oscillate with the same amplitude and phase , in equation ( [ strom ] ) we have @xmath71 and hence we find @xmath72 such that the effective current is given by @xmath73 this effective current is larger than in the uncorrelated case in equation ( [ vt ] ) by a factor of @xmath65 , such that this correlated motion of @xmath65 ions is cooled faster than in the uncorrelated case by a factor of @xmath65 .",
    "in summary , we find @xmath74 as the cooling rate of the mean @xmath65-ion energy in case of an uncorrelated motion of @xmath65 independent ions .",
    "if , however , the ions are correlated by moving with the same phase and amplitude , we find the corresponding cooling rate by @xmath75 .    in a perfect trap , we can separate the center - of - charge motion from motions relative to it at any given time and find the center of charge oscillating with frequency @xmath2 .",
    "this requires the absence of trapping field imperfections including image charge effects on the confining potential . for simplicity assuming only one ion species , the center of charge and the center of mass are identical and may be represented by a single particle with mass and charge of @xmath65 particles . under these idealized conditions",
    ", we may use equation ( [ vier ] ) for the center - of - charge axial coordinate of @xmath65 ions with the substitutions @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath70 instead of @xmath36 is the cooling rate of the @xmath65-particle center of charge axial motion . as discussed above ,",
    "when all ions move in phase , the cooling rate @xmath70 of the axial center - of - charge motion is given by @xmath80 .",
    "if the ions are completely uncorrelated , the cooling rate is @xmath36 .      in reality",
    ", the potential @xmath81 has to include the effect of all induced image charges on the motions of all ions . in a first - order approximation the effect of image charges on the axial center - of - charge motion can be expressed as a shift of the axial oscillation frequency @xcite , but here we will neglect this effect as for the present low ion number densities and experimental resolutions it is not visible .    from newton s",
    "third law it follows that the motion of the center of charge of an ion cloud in a perfect trap remains unaffected when ion - ion interaction is taken into account @xcite .",
    "hence , the presence of a finite space charge density will not change the motion of the center of charge of the ion cloud .",
    "imperfections of the confining fields , however , will create a distribution of axial oscillation frequencies which is not intrinsic to the ion cloud .",
    "while the center of charge is well - defined at any time , its oscillation frequency spectrum does not always contain a single value under these conditions .",
    "the validity of the center - of - charge picture then depends on the experimental details , such as the actual deviation from a single axial oscillation frequency value due to trapping field imperfections .",
    "the finite width of the axial oscillation frequency distribution in a real trap also requires to take the complex nature of the impedance @xmath32 of the resonance circuit seriously . particularly for high charge densities ,",
    "axial frequencies may differ significantly from the resonance frequency @xmath31 of the circuit for which it does not act as an ohmic resistance , but creates retardation effects . at present",
    ", we may ignore this , since the trap imperfections are small and even for very high excitation energies such as 10ev the width of the axial frequency distribution is small when compared to the width of the resonant circuit used for cooling , as will be discussed below .",
    "the presence of a finite axial oscillation frequency distribution , however , provides a mechanism for the transfer of energy between axial motions and the axial center - of - charge motion .",
    "the inverse of the axial frequency width is the average rate at which axial motions transfer energy from relative motions into the axial center - of - charge motion , as has been illustrated in @xcite .",
    "the actual observed time constant for the cooling of axial motions ( which we denote by @xmath82 ) is hence given by the details of the interaction amongst all ions and the imperfections of the confining fields .",
    "these effects will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "the transfer mechanism between radial and axial motions will be discussed in [ rad ] . in section",
    "[ mod ] we will then use the results to form an energy transfer model which tries to explain the observable cooling behaviour in section [ cur ] .      generally , imperfections of the confining fields will make the axial oscillation frequency of any ion dependent on its kinetic energy .",
    "hence , for a distribution of ion energies we expect a distribution of axial oscillation frequencies .",
    "as this is an effect of the interaction between ions and the confining fields , newton s third law does not cancel the effect on the axial center of charge .",
    "this is potentially an issue as the spectral width of a resonant rlc - circuit is limited by the characteristic width @xmath30 .",
    "the most relevant imperfections of the confining fields are deviations of the magnetic field from the homogeneous case and deviations of the electric field from the quadrupolar case .",
    "these effects have been carefully discussed in @xcite . in traps like the present one ,",
    "the dominant contributions to an energy - dependent shift of the axial frequency come from higher - order dependences of the axial trapping potential on the axial and radial coordinates ( including mixed terms ) , measured by the coefficients @xmath83 and @xmath84 as defined in @xcite . following the discussions in @xcite",
    ", there is a relative shift @xmath85 of the axial oscillation frequency of any ion as a function of its energies @xmath86 , @xmath22 and @xmath87 in the perturbed cyclotron , axial , and magnetron motion , respectively .",
    "this shift can be written as @xmath88 where @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 , respectively ) is given by @xmath91 the first term in equation ( [ kap ] ) may be neglected in the following , as @xmath92 .    in the present experiment ,",
    "the leading contribution to magnetic imperfection is the presence of a quadratic component @xmath93 of the magnetic field . in similarity to equation ( [ kap ] )",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath94 such that for the present parameters this effect is negligible when compared to the effect of electric imperfections .",
    "looking at these energy - dependent frequency shifts , we realize that a distribution of axial or radial kinetic energies in an ion cloud will lead to a corresponding distribution of axial oscillation frequencies within that cloud . for a thermalized ion cloud at temperature @xmath39 ,",
    "the distribution of axial and radial energies is boltzmann - like in all motional degrees of freedom and given by @xmath95 all with the expectation value @xmath96 and a typical width of the distribution of roughly @xmath97 .",
    "hence , we expect the width of the axial oscillation frequency distribution over the cloud to be given by @xmath98 here , the first term is due to the axial motion and the and second term is due to the magnetron motion , and @xmath89 is again given by equation ( [ kap2 ] ) , such that we find @xmath99 in the present experiment , we have @xmath100v , @xmath101 t , @xmath102t / mm@xmath103 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 have been tuned out to approximately 10@xmath104 and 10@xmath105 , respectively @xcite . for initial ion temperatures corresponding to 10ev",
    "we expect a relative width of the axial frequency distribution of around 10@xmath21 ( still about two orders of magnitude smaller than the width of the resonant circuit ) which will decrease during cooling as the ion oscillation amplitudes become smaller and less subjected to field imperfections .",
    "note , that the end point of the cooling is around 4k , which corresponds to about @xmath106ev .",
    "assuming an ion cloud of arbitrary initial energy distribution and in the absence of external forces , ion - ion interactions ( coulomb collisions ) thermalize the ions , eventually leading to the same boltzmann distribution of energies within each degree of freedom .",
    "to quantify the time scale for this , we use the thermalization time constant ( spitzer self - collision time ) , estimated by @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the so - called coulomb logarithm which represents the ratio of the maximum to the minimum collision parameter possible under the given conditions , i.e. it represents the cumulative effects of all coulomb collisions . in case of collisions amongst identical ions it is given by @xcite @xmath109 where @xmath110 is given in units of cm@xmath105 and @xmath39 is given in units of ev . for the present parameters ,",
    "@xmath108 is about 20 , and the time constant @xmath112 is of the order of seconds when assuming @xmath13c@xmath14 ions excited to about 10ev and densities of order @xmath113/cm@xmath19 as discussed above . during cooling , as the density increases ,",
    "the thermalization becomes more efficient .",
    "in particular for the present small ion numbers , however , one needs to keep in mind that ion - ion interaction at kinetic energies far from zero leads to ion number densities which fluctuate to the extent to which the collision processes are random , i.e. the density depends on both position and time , and effects which arise from charge densities will show corresponding time - dependences .",
    "hence , all the discussion below will hold only approximately and for time - averages over an oscillation period or longer .",
    "[ [ axial - motions ] ] axial motions + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as discussed above , the inverse of the axial frequency width resulting from equation ( [ axsh ] ) is the average rate at which axial motions transfer energy from relative motions into the center - of - charge motion , see also the discussion in @xcite .",
    "hence , looking at equation ( [ wid ] ) , for the parameters discussed above we estimate the actual cooling time constant of axial motions to be given by @xmath114 and obtain a value of several 100ms for @xmath115 . as this value depends on the ion temperature , it will increase during the cooling process , hence slowing down the cooling as a function of time .",
    "therefore , the expected cooling is not purely exponential , but an exponential @xmath116 with an increasing time constant @xmath117 .",
    "since the spectral width of the axial oscillations determines the energy transfer to the center of charge and hence the cooling , it may be advantageous to artificially introduce field imperfections , e.g. by detuning the trap , during the time of cooling and well within the spectral width of the resonant circuit .",
    "the width @xmath118 of axial oscillation frequencies determines the quality factor of the ion cloud @xmath119 . in nearly harmonic traps ,",
    "this quality factor is typically much higher than the quality factor @xmath25 of the resonant circuit , such that in resonance @xmath24 we may assume the impedance @xmath32 to represent a purely ohmic resistance @xmath29 . at present",
    ", this is the case as @xmath120 and @xmath26 .",
    "when the trap is made anharmonic such that no longer @xmath121 , the ion - circuit interaction becomes more complicated and equation ( [ str2 ] ) is no longer valid .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath32 will then limit the meaningful values of the detuning .",
    "[ [ radial - motions ] ] radial motions + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    transfer of energy into the axial center - of - charge and relative axial motions can take place also from radial motions , as the radial degrees of freedom contribute to the reservoir of kinetic energies present .",
    "the radial motions are cooled with a time constant @xmath122 given by the extent they transfer energy into axial motions which are directly or indirectly cooled , as in the present experiment there is no radial resistive cooling . in section [ rad ]",
    "we have seen that we may estimate @xmath123 by the spitzer self - collision time @xmath112 which at present is of the order of several seconds and decreases during cooling .",
    "the transfer of radial energy into axial degrees of freedom may be increased by active coupling of the motions .",
    "this is possible for example by irradiation of an inhomogeneous electric field at the sum or difference frequency of the motions to be coupled ( mode coupling ) .",
    "this technique has been applied in several experiments @xcite and is explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "mode coupling mediates a net energy transfer from the higher - energy motion to the lower - energy motion at a rate depending on parameters such as the irradiated power .",
    "it may prove helpful particularly for ion clouds of very low density .",
    "[ [ energy - reservoirs - and - transfer - rates ] ] energy reservoirs and transfer rates + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    generally , we may expect to observe three different processes : the center - of - charge cooling with its time constant @xmath124 , a cooling of axial motions with a time - dependent ( increasing ) @xmath82 and a cooling of radial motions with a time - dependent ( decreasing ) @xmath122 .",
    "this is a valid picture so long as the oscillation of the center of charge is well within the frequency spectrum of the resonant circuit , i.e. as long as the trapping field imperfections are small .",
    "it is important to realize that the observability of the different components in an experiment depends crucially on the amounts of energy present in the respective motions at @xmath125 .",
    "if the ion cloud is assumed to be completely thermalized , and as long as ion - ion collision rates are small enough to allow a separation of modes of oscillation , we expect @xmath126 in the axial center - of - charge motion , the relative axial motions , and in the radial motions , respectively , when @xmath54 is the total energy present .",
    "thus , we have a hierarchy @xmath127 with negligible relative center - of - charge energy for @xmath128 .",
    "as discussed above , in such a thermalized situation , we expect cooling of the axial center - of - charge motion to occur with the single - ion cooling time constant @xmath49 , see the discussion in section [ disc ] .",
    "also , as the energy transfers occur simultaneously , we expect to observe only the combined action on the ion cloud , which may not be well - separated ( in the time domain ) if the time constants are of similar order .",
    "moreover , as the axial time constant @xmath115 is expected to increase with time , while the radial time constant @xmath123 is expected to decrease with time , the expected ion signal may not allow a distinction of individual contributions .",
    "we have used the above model to calculate the expected ion signal ( @xmath129 through the circuit ) as a function of time for the present experimental parameters .",
    "we have assumed the initial energies @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 to be thermally distributed according to equations ( [ thi ] ) , and the time constants @xmath133 , @xmath115 and @xmath134 in the model depicted in figure [ box ] to be given by equations ( [ str2 ] ) , ( [ coola ] ) and ( [ dav ] ) ,     as a function of time",

    "for the resulting ion signal @xmath139 we use equation ( [ str2 ] ) with an energy @xmath140 given by @xmath141 note , that as @xmath115 and @xmath123 depend on the ion energy and density , they are implicitly time - dependent and hence form coupled differential equations with ( [ eee ] ) which we have evaluated numerically .    figure [ simul ] shows the resulting curves .",
    "the small energy content in the center - of - charge motion does not lead to a visible signal decaying with @xmath133 on this scale .",
    "note , that in a thermalized ion cloud @xmath133 is given by @xmath49 .",
    "instead , for high initial ion excitation the curve features a fast cooling with @xmath115 and a slow cooling with @xmath123 separated by a plateau .",
    "the plateau is pronounced as for high initial ion excitation the density @xmath110 is low and @xmath123 is initially very large , see the time evolution of @xmath123 in the lower inset of figure [ simul ] .",
    "the upper inset in figure [ simul ] shows the time evolution of @xmath115 . to compare to the case of small initial ion excitation",
    ", the dotted curve shows the calculated cooling behaviour for an initial excitation smaller by one order of magnitude .",
    "it lacks the plateau , as for small excitation , the ion number density @xmath110 is sufficiently high from the beginning to produce a value of @xmath123 which is much smaller and comparable to the value of @xmath115 , hence there is no clear distinction .",
    "we have performed two sets of experiments , one with a pure cloud of @xmath13c@xmath14 ions , we will refer to these as resistive cooling measurements , and one with a mixture of different ion species ( one of which is @xmath13c@xmath14 ) , to which we will refer as sympathetic cooling measurements .      upon ion creation and confinement , a single species is selected by resonant ejection of all unwanted ions from the trap .",
    "the number of remaining ions is determined from a bolometric measurement . in the present case ,",
    "30 @xmath13c@xmath14 ions have been confined and investigated upon .",
    "the ions are excited by white noise excitation of the axial motion with a specific voltage amplitude @xmath142 through one endcap for 5 seconds . upon excitation ,",

    "then , c@xmath14 is brought into resonance with the rlc circuit by choosing @xmath144v for a variable time @xmath34 between 0 and 140 seconds .",
    "this is direct resistive cooling of the c@xmath14 ions to an axial energy which depends on the cooling time . during that time",

    "hence the detected signal is a measure of the ion energy @xmath22 .",

    "]    they tend to decrease with increasing excitation voltage @xmath142 , which is in agreement with equation ( [ coola ] ) : for larger initial amplitudes the expected axial frequency width increases , making axial energy transfer more efficient . for large motional amplitudes ,",
    "the situation approaches the case of independent ions without a fixed phase relation , for which cooling is expected to occur with the single - ion cooling time constant @xmath49 , see the discussion in section [ disc ] .",
    "when looking at figure [ h ] , the data support this interpretation , as the measured single - ion cooling time constant @xmath150ms approximately agrees with the independent - ion limit for @xmath151 of @xmath152ms when an exponential function is fitted to the cooling time constants @xmath82 as a function of @xmath142 .",
    "the choice of an exponential is not motivated by theory and thus arbitrary , but describes the data well for all practical purposes present .",
    "the slow component of the decay after the plateau ( attributed to radial energy transfer into axial motions with a time constant @xmath122 ) tends to increase with increasing initial excitation : an exponential fit for @xmath153s yields 4.43(13)s for 5v , 5.14(21)s for 7v , 7.11(19)s for 9v and 8.25(30)s for 12v .",

    "a simple exponential decay has been fitted to the data . ]    for each ion species in the spectrum , the resulting time evolution @xmath147 can be fitted by a simple exponential decay of the kind ( [ dec ] ) with different time constants for each ion species .",
    "figure [ b ] shows the example of c@xmath157 .",
    "we can extend the thermalization as described by equation ( [ dav ] ) to two different ion species to obtain an expected time constant for sympathetic cooling .",
    "we then have to write the coulomb logarithm in the form @xcite @xmath158 \\nonumber\\ ] ] where again the densities @xmath110 are given in units of cm@xmath105 and the temperatures @xmath39 are given in units of ev . assuming full spatial overlap of the ions ,",
    "the sympathetic cooling time constant for a species 1 by a reservoir of species 2 is given by @xcite @xmath159 the temperature evolution of the cooled species is then given by @xmath160 . in case of several different coolants , this is generalized to @xmath161 .",
    "for the present parameters , the sympathetic cooling time constant @xmath162 is of the order of seconds , when @xmath13c@xmath14 ions are used to cool similar ions of roughly the same or slightly smaller density .    with regard to equation ( [ elf ] ) ,",
    "we have plotted the resulting cooling time constants as a function of the ions squared charge divided by their mass ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ c ] .",
    "the cooling time constants are of order seconds , hence they agree with sympathetic cooling time constants as predicted by equation ( [ elf ] ) .    .",
    "a linear fit has been applied to the data . ]    obviously , a linear dependence of the cooling time constant @xmath162 on @xmath163 is supported by the data , at least for the present low ion number densities , which is also in agreement with equation ( [ elf ] ) : for a given coolant , the expected cooling time depends linearly on the @xmath163 of the ions to be cooled . further application of equation ( [ elf ] ) to this situation is , however , not straight - forward , as some details of the interactions amongst the ions are unclear , for example whether there is centrifugal separation between species which reduces the spatial overlap etc .",
    "also , we are not concerned with two , but with several different species which all interact simultaneously . in principle , one would need to write down coupled cooling rate equations like ( [ elf ] ) for all present species and compare to the observations , however , the present data do not allow such a detailed analysis .",
    "still , the expected slope of the sympathetic cooling time constant with @xmath164 of the cooled c@xmath14 ions @xmath165 according to equation ( [ elf ] ) of about -2.8s/(e@xmath103/u ) is in fair agreement with the measured slope in figure [ c ] of -2.4(2)s/(e@xmath103/u ) , given the unaccounted average over different ion species .",
    "we have performed measurements of resistive and sympathetic cooling of dilute clouds of highly charged ions confined in a penning trap .",
    "resistive cooling of a single ion species leads to non - exponential energy loss with a fast and a slow component , which , depending on the initial level of ion excitation , may be well - separated in time and produce visible features such as a pronounced plateau between the components .",
    "the faster of the observed cooling time constants @xmath82 is in fair agreement with the value expected from the present trapping field imperfections and ion - ion interactions .",
    "this observed cooling rate is given by the transfer of axial energy into the axial center - of - charge motion and is generally time - dependent , as the rate of energy transfer depends on the ion kinetic energy itself .",
    "the time constant @xmath115 is hence not a true constant , but increases as a function of cooling time .",
    "the slower of the observed components has a time constant @xmath122 of the order of seconds and is attributed to energy transfer from radial motions into axial motions by coulomb collisions .",
    "@xmath123 is also not a true constant , as the energy transfer rate through collisions is density- and energy - dependent .",
    "hence , as a function of cooling time , its rate increases with the increasing ion number density and the decreasing ion energy .",
    "the cooling time constant @xmath133 of the axial center - of - charge motion has not been resolved , as for a non - thermal ion cloud the cooling is expected outside of the time scale of observation , while for a thermalized ion cloud the expected energy content of this motion is too small to be observed directly in the present experiment .",
    "sympathetic cooling of a distribution of species by resistively cooled ions which are simultaneously trapped leads to motional energy loss of all confined species which can be described by exponential decays , with time constants depending roughly linearly on the squared - charge to mass ratio @xmath163 of the respective species .",
    "the observed sympathetic cooling time constants of the ion clouds are of the order of seconds and are in fair agreement with expectations from physics of non - neutral plasmas .",
    "this is also true for their scaling with the charge - to - mass ratios of the ions .",
    "more exact quantitative statements about this suffer from the fact that cooling of clouds strongly depends on details of the electronic cooling and detection scheme , and on initial conditions prior to cooling , such as the ion distributions in position and momentum space , which commonly are largely unknown in experiments .",
    "this is also a problem when simulations and experimental findings are to be compared .    to fully understand the behaviour of ion clouds under resistive and sympathetic cooling",
    ", it appears necessary to perform further systematic measurements , particularly of ion - number dependent quantities , and to make direct comparisons with simulations , which above all demands well - defined initial conditions prior to cooling .",
