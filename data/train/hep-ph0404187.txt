    "thanks to the accumulating data from experiments on the atmospheric and solar neutrinos experiments @xcite , we are now convinced that neutrinos oscillate among three active neutrinos . interpreting each experiment in terms of two - flavor mixing , the mixing angle for the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos",
    "is understood to be maximal or nearly maximal : @xmath1 , whereas the one for the oscillation of solar neutrinos is not maximal but large : @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , was obtained from the non - observation of the disappearance of @xmath5 in the chooz experiment@xcite with @xmath6 .",
    "the unitary mixing matrix is defined via @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a flavor eigenstate and @xmath9 is a mass eigenstate . including data from sno@xcite and kamland@xcite , the range of the magnitude of the mns mixing matrix is given by @xcite , |u|",

    "it can be readily recognized that the central values of elements in the mixing matrix in eq.([mixnum ] ) are pointing an elegant form , which is called tri / bi - maximal mixing@xcite , u_tb = (    ccc & & 0 + - & & - + - & &    ) , [ tribi ] which consists of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "there are some literatures@xcite which proposed textures of the mass matrix based on the particular mixing type @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , the baryon density of our universe @xmath15 implied by wmap(wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) data indicates the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe@xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are number density of baryon , anti - baryon and photon , respectively .",
    "the leptogenesis @xcite has become a compelling theory to explain the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe , due to increasing reliance on the seesaw mechanism from experiments .",
    "theory for lepton asymmetry requires two heavy right - handed neutrinos or more .",
    "for that reason , a class of models with two heavy right - handed neutrinos and @xmath19 neutrino dirac mass matrix is called the minimal neutrino seesaw models(mnsms ) which were intensively studied by several authors recently @xcite , especially for simple dirac mass textures that make prediction compatible with solar and atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "the main framework of our work is seesaw mechanism in bottom - up approach .",
    "we launch our analysis by taking @xmath14 for mixing of light neutrinos and then investigate the structure of @xmath20 dirac matrix .",
    "that is , our concern remains on the combination of tri / bi - maximal mixing and mnsms , in order to study the phenomenological implication of the high energy theory based on the low energy theory .",
    "one advantage of our framework is that physical observables can be explained in minimal terms of physical parameters . in section",
    "ii , we present the light neutrino mass matrix in terms of the mixing given in eq.([tribi ] ) and mass squared differences measured in experiment . the mass matrix reconstructed in that way will constrain dirac mass matrix . in subsections , depending on the type of mass hierarchy , possible",
    "@xmath20 dirac matrices will be examined carefully . in section iii",
    ", leptogenesis will be discussed in details based on the dirac matrices investigated before . in section iv , we will present numerical results on leptogenesis in our scheme and a relationship between leptogenesis and neutrinoless double beta decay as well as the lower bound of @xmath21 will be discussed focusing on the contribution from a single majorana phase .",
    "in general , a unitary mixing matrix for 3 generations of neutrinos is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 s are rotations with three angles and a dirac phase @xmath24 and the @xmath25 with majorana phases @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a diagonal phase transformation .",
    "the mass matrix of light neutrinos is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are real positive masses of light neutrinos . or the majorana phases can be embedded in the diagonal mass matrix such that @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    if the @xmath14 in eq.([tribi ] ) is adopted for the @xmath34 in eq.([umu ] ) , the light neutrino mass is m _ = m_1 (    ccc 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1    ) + (    ccc 1 & 1 & 1 + 1 & 1 & 1 + 1 & 1 & 1    ) + (    ccc 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 1 & -1 + 0 & -1 & 1    ) , [ mass1 ] which orients toward a minimal model of neutrino sector by removing an angle and the dirac phase . with sno and kamland , data have narrowed down the possible mass spectrum of neutrinos into two types , normal hierarchy ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 , and inverse hierarchy ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 for msw lma .",
    "those two types include the possibility of zero mass for a neutrino , which is necessarily followed by relegating one of the majorana phases to the unphysical .",
    "in other words , the minimal model with the physical observables which the present experimental data guarantee can be obtained by @xmath14 and dictating zero mass to one generation of neutrinos , where the non - zero physical parameters in the model consist of 2 masses , 2 angles , one majorana phase .    when only two of three neutrinos are massive , by accommodating the experimental results @xmath39 and @xmath40 to the two types of mass hierarchies , one can obtain the following expressions for mass eigenvalues , @xmath41 phase transformation @xmath42 now can replace the phase transformation in eq.([fulltrans ] ) without loss of generality , whether @xmath35 or @xmath37 , so that one can single @xmath43 out in order to investigate the cp violating contribution of the majorana phase .",
    "effective neutrino mass models with one zero mass eigenvalue involved in three active neutrinos can be generated naturally from mnsms . in the basis the mass matrix @xmath44 of right - handed neutrinos @xmath45",
    "is diagonal , the model is given @xmath46 from which the light masses are derived through the seesaw mechanism , @xmath47 in top - down approach .",
    "on the other hand , the matrix @xmath48 is found as the solution to the seesaw mechanism in bottom - up approach once one launches the analysis with the light neutrino masses @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath50 be the masses of right - handed neutrinos and @xmath51 the elements of the matrix @xmath49 .",
    "the dirac matrix , @xmath52 is resulted in with @xmath53 ,          \\nonumber \\\\              & & b_i = \\frac{1}{m_{11 } } \\left [ b_1 m_{1i } +              \\sigma_i a_1 \\sqrt{m_{11}m_{ii}-m_{1i}^2}\\right ] ,              \\label{key } \\\\              & & m_{11}m_{23 } =   \\left[m_{12}m_{13 } + \\sigma_2\\sigma_3              \\sqrt{\\left(m_{11}m_{22}-m_{12}^2\\right )              \\left(m_{11}m_{33}-m_{13}^2\\right ) } \\right].\\nonumber              \\label{bargerhe }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath54 is 2 or 3 , the @xmath55 is a sign @xmath56 , and the sign of @xmath57 is fixed as positive .",
    "the solution in eq .",
    "( [ bargerhe ] ) was first derived and formulated in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is clear that only 5 parameters out of 6 ; @xmath58 can be specified in terms of the elements of @xmath49 .",
    "there are various ways to decrease the number of parameters in dirac matrix , posing one or more zeros or posing equalities between elements for the matrix texture .",
    "it is known that texture zeros or equalities among matrix entries can be generated by imposing additional symmetries to the theory .    in this paper , we focus on posing one or more zeros in dirac matrix , and show that only one - zero textures are allowed for @xmath35 and only one - zero and two - zero textures are allowed for @xmath37 , accompanied with the low energy mixing @xmath14 . on the other hand , from eq.([key ] ) , one can recognize that , if there exists a kind of symmetry between entries in @xmath49 , the dirac matrix also has a symmetry in certain entries inherited from the symmetry of the @xmath49 .",
    "so , there are a number of patterns with equalities among the entries in dirac matrices obtained with one or two zeros , as a consequence of maximal mixing .      with @xmath59 , the neutrino mass @xmath49 in eq.([mass1 ] ) reduces to @xmath60 where @xmath61 , which , using eq.([key ] ) , gives rise to dirac matrix with the following entries : @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",

    "@xmath76 or @xmath77 cases will not be presented as an independent case , since it can be made by exchanging @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath74 with @xmath73 from @xmath35 2-a and 2-b .",
    "with @xmath80 , @xmath81 where @xmath82 , which , using eq.([key ] ) , gives rise to dirac matrix with the following entries : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the equality @xmath86 in eq.([ihmass ] ) , which is again a consequence of the maximal mixing of atmospheric neutrinos , constrains the elements of the dirac matrix such that @xmath87 .",

    "the baryon asymmetry eq.([baryon ] ) can be rephrased @xmath96 the @xmath97 is the photon number density and the @xmath98 is entropy density so that the number density with respect to a co - moving volume element is taken into account .",
    "the baryon asymmetry produced through sphaleron process is related to the lepton asymmetry @xcite by y_b = a y_b - l = y_l , where @xmath99 , for example , @xmath100 for the standard model(sm ) with three generations of fermions and a single higgs doublet , @xmath101 .",
    "the purpose of this work is to estimate whether the yukawa interaction which produces the light neutrinos with the mixing eq.([tribi ] ) through the seesaw mechanism can also generate a sufficient lepton asymmetry for the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "the generation of a lepton asymmetry requires the cp - asymmetry and out - of - equilibrium condition .",

    "the washout effect of asymmetry is most suppressed with the dirac matrix of type @xmath146 , where , depending on @xmath26 , the dilution factor ranges from 0.010 to 0.013 , the amount of asymmetry survived from washout is at most about 1@xmath147 . when @xmath148 , the boltzmann equations still depict the finite value of @xmath104 as @xmath149 increases for the universe evolution @xcite@xcite@xcite",
    "based on the formulation of the leptogenesis derived in the previous section , we numerically analyze baryon asymmetry for each case classified as @xmath35 or @xmath37 . for the numerical calculation",

    "it is clear that the cp asymmetry in high energy is almost proportional to the imaginary part of majorana cp contribution in low energy from eqs.([delta1])-([delta6 ] ) .",

    "the lower bound of @xmath21 with @xmath165 is pulled down to @xmath166 gev for @xmath153 , whereas that for @xmath162 is @xmath167gev . suppressing a certain yukawa coupling by putting a texture",
    "zero can vary the amount of the asymmetry by order of magnitude .    in fig.2 , we plot @xmath152 as a function of the majorana phase @xmath26 for @xmath168 .",

    "the prediction of @xmath152 for @xmath37 with the same value of @xmath21 is smaller than that for @xmath35 because @xmath118 for @xmath37 is proportional to @xmath172 which corresponds to the solar mass squared difference , while @xmath118 for @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath173 which corresponds to the atmospheric mass squared difference .",
    "we expect from eqs.(25 - 28 ) that the predictions of @xmath152 s for other cases of @xmath37 are almost the same as that for @xmath37 1-a because @xmath174 .",
    "although the majorana phase is not detectable through neutrino oscillations , it may affect the amplitude of neutrinoless double beta decay .",
