    "degeneracy loci of general bundle morphisms of the form @xmath9 have been studied by several authors , for example m.c .",
    "chang ( @xcite ) and g. ottaviani ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have performed here a study of these loci in the general case , computing in particular a locally free resolution of their ideals , the cohomology groups of their ideal sheaf and their degree .",
    "they result to be all arithmetically buchsbaum varieties , with interesting geometrical properties .",
    "this can be seen by the classical geometrical interpretation of the sections of @xmath10 as linear line complexes in @xmath2 .",
    "for example , if @xmath11 is odd , they are scrolls , while , if @xmath11 is even , they are unirational varieties .",
    "we have considered then the particular case of @xmath3 with @xmath12 . if @xmath13 , the degeneracy locus @xmath14 is the union of three lines .",
    "we have analyzed the possible configurations of these lines , obtaining the result that @xmath14 has the expected dimension @xmath15 if and only if @xmath14 is exactly the union of three skew lines generating @xmath3 , i.e. without any common secant line .    this has been applied to the case @xmath6 . here , if the degeneracy locus @xmath14 has the expected dimension @xmath16 , @xmath14 is an elliptic normal scroll of degree six .",
    "it is known that the hilbert scheme @xmath7 of elliptic normal scrolls in @xmath3 has dimension @xmath17 ( see @xcite ) , which is equal to the dimension of @xmath18 , the grassmannian parametrizing maps @xmath19 .",
    "moreover there is an open subset in @xmath7 corresponding to elliptic scrolls with only two distinct unisecant cubics .",
    "there is a natural rational map @xmath20 : we have studied this map , in particular to understand if it is dominant and what are its fibres .",
    "this problem had been tackled classically by g. fano in @xcite .",
    "our result , which was already known to fano , is theorem [ fano ] , saying that if @xmath14 is an elliptic normal scroll in @xmath3 with only two distinct unisecant cubics , then there are exactly four general nets of linear line complexes having @xmath14 as singular surface .",
    "so the map @xmath21 is dominant with general fibre of degree four .",
    "if @xmath14 is an elliptic normal scroll with only one unisecant cubic or with a @xmath15-dimensional family of unisecant cubics , this result remains still valid , but _",
    "one _ of the four nets having @xmath14 as singular surface is not general , i.e. it contains some special complexes of second type .",
    "in this situation , the singular locus of such a net does not have the expected codimension @xmath22 , but @xmath16 : indeed it is the union of @xmath14 with the singular @xmath22-space of the special complexes of second type contained in the net .",
    "we will denote by @xmath2 the projective space of dimension @xmath11 over an algebraically closed field @xmath23 of characteristic @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath25 is a sheaf on @xmath26 , the direct sum of @xmath27 copies of @xmath25 will be denoted by @xmath28 or else by @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the sheaf of regular functions on @xmath2 and @xmath32 be the cotangent sheaf .",
    "@xmath32 is locally free of rank @xmath11 .",
    "we recall that the cohomology groups @xmath33 are zero if @xmath34 , while @xmath10 is generated by its global sections and @xmath35 .",
    "a morphism @xmath36 is assigned by giving @xmath27 global sections of @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath37 , then @xmath27 general sections of @xmath10 are linearly independent , so a _ general _ morphism @xmath38 is generically injective .",
    "we want to study such a morphism @xmath38 for @xmath37 and , in particular , its degeneracy locus @xmath14 . from bertini type theorems we have that , if non - empty , @xmath14 has the expected codimension @xmath39 , that is @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore the singular locus of @xmath14 , @xmath41 , has dimension at most @xmath42 .",
    "in particular @xmath14 is smooth if @xmath43 .",
    "eagon - northcott s theorem ( see for instance @xcite ) gives a locally free resolution of @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , @xmath38 is general , therefore the eagon - northcott s complexes associated to the dual morphism @xmath45 are exact and have length equal to the codimension of @xmath14 .",
    "the first of such complexes can be written as follows :    @xmath46    with natural maps induced by @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore the class of @xmath14 in the chow ring of @xmath2 is the top chern class @xmath47 ; in particular we can compute the degree of @xmath14 , which is :    @xmath48    we recall the following isomorphisms :    @xmath49    @xmath50    substituting in ( [ en ] ) and twisting by @xmath51 , we obtain at last :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the ideal sheaf of @xmath14 . from this resolution , we can compute the dimensions of the cohomology groups of @xmath53 .",
    "the cohomology groups @xmath54 for @xmath55 are all zero , except the following ones :    @xmath56 if @xmath57 is odd , @xmath58 if @xmath57 is even .    in particular , x is arithmetically buchsbaum .",
    "_ proof_. the dimensions of the groups @xmath54 can be computed from ( [ en2 ] ) . in particular , the multiplication maps @xmath59 are all zero for @xmath55 and the following condition of stckrad - vogel ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , which ensures that @xmath14 is arithmetically buchsbaum , is fulfilled : if @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 , then @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64    we recall now a very nice geometrical interpretation of a morphism @xmath38 as above ( see @xcite ) .    from the euler sequence for @xmath65 twisted by two : @xmath66    taking global sections and noting that @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    ", we obtain @xmath69 .",
    "this allows to interpret a global section of @xmath10 as a bilinear alternating form on @xmath70 , or as a skew - symmetric matrix of type @xmath71 with entries in the base field .",
    "so a general morphism @xmath38 is assigned by giving @xmath27 general skew - symmetric matrices @xmath72 and",
    "the corresponding degeneracy locus @xmath14 in @xmath2 is the set of the points @xmath73 such that :    3 ( _ 1a_1++_ma_m)[p]=0    for some @xmath74 , where @xmath75 $ ] denotes the column matrix of the coordinates of @xmath73 .",
    "since a skew - symmetric matrix always is of even rank , to study equation ( 3 ) we have to distinguish two cases :    1 .",
    "if @xmath11 is even , for every @xmath27-tuple @xmath76 equation ( 3 ) has at least one solution @xmath77 ; in this case @xmath14 is an unirational variety parametrized by @xmath78 ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath11 is odd , then the vanishing of the pfaffian of the matrix @xmath79 defines a hypersurface @xmath80 of degree @xmath81 in @xmath78 , where @xmath76 are homogeneus coordinates .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath38 is _ general _ , for a fixed point @xmath82\\in z$ ] , we find a line of solutions of ( 3 ) in @xmath14 , so that @xmath14 is a scroll over @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , from these observations we can conclude that @xmath14 is always non - empty .    to see another interpretation of global sections of @xmath10 ,",
    "let us consider @xmath83 , the grassmannian of lines in @xmath2 , embedded in @xmath84 via the plcker map .",
    "the dual space @xmath85 parametrizes hyperplane sections of @xmath86 or , in the old terminology , the _ linear line complexes _ in @xmath2 . such a linear complex @xmath87 is represented by a linear equation in the plcker coordinates @xmath88 : @xmath89 .",
    "we can associate to it a skew - symmetric matrix @xmath90 of order @xmath91 .",
    "a point @xmath92 is called a _ centre _ of @xmath87 if all lines through @xmath73 belong to @xmath87 .",
    "the space @xmath93 results to be the set of centres of @xmath87 : it is called the _ singular space _ of @xmath87 .",
    "once again we have to distinguish the following two cases :    1 .   if @xmath11 is even , then every linear complex @xmath87 possesses at least one centre .",
    "@xmath87 is said to be _ special _ if its singular space is at least a plane .",
    "a special @xmath87 corresponds to a hyperplane section of @xmath86 with a tangent hyperplane or , equivalently , to a point of @xmath94 , the dual variety of @xmath86 .",
    "it is known that , @xmath11 being even , the dual grassmannian @xmath94 has codimension three in @xmath95 .",
    "if @xmath11 is odd , then a general linear complex @xmath87 does not have any centre , whereas it is said to be _ special _ if its singular space is at least a line .",
    "as above , if @xmath87 is special , it corresponds to a tangent hyperplane section of @xmath86 or , which is the same , to a point of @xmath94 which in this case is a hypersurface in @xmath95 of degree @xmath81 .    from this discussion",
    ", it follows that it is possible to interpret the degeneracy locus @xmath14 of a general morphism @xmath96 as the set of centres of complexes belonging to a general linear system @xmath97 of dimension @xmath98 of complexes in @xmath2 .",
    "such a @xmath97 is generated by @xmath27 independent complexes and corresponds to a linear subspace @xmath78 in @xmath85 .",
    "the special complexes in @xmath97 are parametrized by the intersection @xmath99 .",
    "we conclude this section by giving some examples .    *",
    "@xmath100 : @xmath14 is the union of two skew lines ; * @xmath101 : @xmath14 is a smooth quadric , it can be seen as a scroll of degree two over a conic ; * @xmath102 : @xmath14 is an irreducible conic ; * @xmath103 : @xmath14 is a smooth projected veronese surface ; * @xmath104 : @xmath14 is a so - called segre cubic @xmath22-fold , which has been extensively studied .",
    "it is singular with singular locus formed by ten distinct points ; * @xmath105 : @xmath14 is the union of three lines in @xmath3 ; we shall study the possible configurations of @xmath14 in  3 ; * @xmath106 : @xmath14 is a scroll over a plane cubic , of degree six in @xmath3 , i.e. an elliptic normal scroll in @xmath3 ; we shall study this situation in  4 ; * @xmath107 : @xmath14 is a @xmath22-fold of degree seven , which is scroll over a cubic surface in @xmath108 .",
    "it is also known as palatini scroll ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we will study in detail the pencils of linear complexes in @xmath3 , or , in other words , maps @xmath109 and their degeneracy loci .",
    "we will denote by the same symbol a line both as a subset of @xmath3 and as a point of @xmath110 .",
    "let us recall that the grassmannian @xmath110 is an @xmath111-dimensional variety in @xmath112 .",
    "a general linear complex of lines in @xmath3 does not have any centre , whereas the special complexes can be of _ first or second type _",
    ", if they have a line or a @xmath108 as singular space , respectively .",
    "the dual space @xmath113 parametrizes linear line complexes : special complexes correspond to points of the cubic hypersurface @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore special complexes of second type can be interpreted as points of the grassmannian @xmath115 ( which is also embedded in @xmath113 ) , because a special complex of second type is determined uniquely by its singular space @xmath108 : it is formed by the lines intersecting that @xmath108 .    we introduce a rational surjective map : @xmath116    which maps a special complex ( of first type ) to its singular line .",
    "so @xmath117 is regular on @xmath118 .    the closure of the fibre @xmath119 over a line _",
    "l _ is formed by all special complexes having _ l _ as singular line .",
    "these fibres are linear spaces of dimension five ; in fact we may interpret @xmath120 as the linear system of hyperplanes in @xmath112 containing the tangent space to @xmath110 at the point _",
    "l _ : @xmath121 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath122 for @xmath120 .",
    "[ oss1 ] let @xmath123 be lines of @xmath3 .",
    "then the intersection of @xmath124 with @xmath115 is a smooth quadric of dimension _",
    "4_. in fact , it is formed by the @xmath108 s containing @xmath125 : this is a schubert subvariety of the grassmannian and precisely a quadric .    also the intersection of the fibres @xmath126 is contained in @xmath115 and is just one point , if @xmath125 and @xmath27 do not intersect , or a plane , if they intersect .",
    "indeed note that @xmath126 is the set of the special complexes of second type , whose singular space contains both @xmath125 and @xmath27 . if @xmath127 , then the linear span @xmath128 is a @xmath108 ,",
    "so @xmath126 is the point corresponding to the special complex of second type whose singular space is @xmath128 .",
    "whereas , if @xmath129 , then @xmath128 is a plane @xmath130 and @xmath131 is the plane corresponding to the linear system of @xmath108 s containing @xmath130 .",
    "let @xmath132 be a line in @xmath113 : @xmath132 represents a pencil of linear complexes .",
    "in the general case , @xmath132 meets @xmath133 at three points , which do not belong to @xmath115 .",
    "therefore the most general pencil of linear complexes in @xmath3 contains three special complexes of first type .",
    "let @xmath134 be the singular lines of these three complexes .",
    "we distinguish four possibilities for the reciprocal positions of the three lines .",
    "* case 1 . * the lines @xmath135 are two by two skew and generate the whole @xmath3 .",
    "this is the most general situation . in this case",
    "the three lines do not have any trisecant line .",
    "* case 2 . * the lines @xmath135 are two by two skew and generate a @xmath136 .",
    "equivalently , the three lines have one and only one trisecant line .",

    "* case 4 . * the lines @xmath135 are not two by two skew .",
    "let us analyze separately the four cases .",
    "we will see that only in the first case the pencil of linear complexes is general .",
    "* let @xmath137 be the space that parametrizes special complexes having @xmath135 as singular line and let @xmath138 be the linear span in @xmath3 of @xmath135 and @xmath139 for @xmath140 .",
    "note that , by the assumption on the reciprocal position of the lines , @xmath141 .",
    "we will use the same notation for @xmath138 as a @xmath22-space in @xmath3 and for @xmath138 as a point of @xmath115 .",

    "proof_. we observe first that our assumption on @xmath132 is equivalent to the fact that @xmath132 intersects all the three spaces @xmath148 .",
    "moreover @xmath149 is the line @xmath150 through @xmath138 and @xmath151 ( see figure 1 . ) .",
    "so every line in @xmath147 meets @xmath152 and @xmath153 and therefore represents a pencil having @xmath134 as singular lines .",

    "now , note that @xmath132 is contained both in @xmath165 and in @xmath166 and therefore in their intersection , which is the plane @xmath147 ( again by grassmann relation ) .",
    "so we have a contradiction that makes us conclude that @xmath167 .    from remark [ oss1 ]",
    ", it follows that each line @xmath150 meets @xmath115 only at the two points @xmath138 and @xmath151 , otherwise it would be contained in @xmath115 , which is excluded by our assumptions .",

    "but @xmath147 is now contained in @xmath115 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath138 s intersect two by two along a plane in @xmath169 , precisely @xmath174 , for all @xmath175 .",
    "this means that the lines @xmath176 , joining the corresponding points in the plcker embedding , are completely contained in @xmath115 , which is a smooth quadric , and this implies that also @xmath177 .",
    "the pencils of line complexes having @xmath168 as singular lines can be obtained exactly as in case 1 . , but _ all of them contain at least one special complex of second type_. in particular , those corresponding to the lines in @xmath147 are pencils of complexes all special of second type .",
    "* if @xmath168 are two by two skew but generate a @xmath108 , then @xmath178 and @xmath147 `` collapses '' to a point .",

    "* when at least two among @xmath168 intersect each other , several configurations are possible .",
    "it is clear from the previous discussion that , in all cases , we get pencils containing special complexes of the second type",
