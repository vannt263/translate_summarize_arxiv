    "electric field effect in superconductors continues to attract considerable attention in science and technology @xcite .",
    "the external field can modulate the charge density and resistance , and control a reversible superconductor - insulator switching behavior which plays a key role in the development of superconducting field - effect transistors ( sufets ) @xcite . especially in the high - t@xmath0 superconducting cuprates , the field effect is expected to be strong , since their low carrier density leads to larger electric field penetration depths @xmath1  nm . recently , complex ferroelectric oxide materials with high dielectric constant like ba@xmath2sr@xmath3tio@xmath4 ( bst ) and pb(zr@xmath2ti@xmath3)o@xmath4 ( pzt)@xcite have been used to achieve substantial carrier modulation and shift of @xmath5 of several k.    due to the small width of the accumulation layers at the contacts , the effect of the polarization - induced field is most significant in ultrathin superconducting films of a few nanometers thickness@xcite . with the difficulties related to the fabrication of ultrathin films and interfaces of good quality , theoretical modelling can be an additional effective tool to study these systems . in the bilayer structures ,",
    "the ferroelectric polarization at the interface attracts or repels the charge carriers in the superconducting film , in close analogy to the effect of doping @xcite .",
    "however , the field effect in fe - s _ multilayers _ where the polarization acts on both superconducting surfaces and may strongly modify the internal charge distribution in the entire ultrathin s - film , is a nontrivial and challenging problem .",
    "motivated by recent experiments@xcite , in this work we show that the use of multilayers can drastically amplify the field effect , hence leading to much stronger increase of the superconducting transition temperature in comparison to s - fe bilayers typically exploited in sufets .",
    "in the approach considered here , we directly describe the internal charge redistribution in a ultrathin s - film caused by the ferroelectric polarization . assuming the existence of an effectice attractive interaction , we focus on the question of how the superconducting state in the film can be influenced by this polarization .",
    "specifically , we consider a hybrid system composed of periodically alternating fe- and s - layers with the ferroelectric polarization @xmath6 directed perpendicular to the interface , as shown in fig .",
    "the thickness of the fe subsystem is given by the number @xmath7 of monolayers @xmath8 in each ferroelectric layer .",
    "in the s - film , @xmath9 denotes the number of    = 6.5 cm    superconducting planes .",
    "we propose to describe the structure by the following model : + ( i ) the two possible orientations of ferroelectric dipoles ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) caused by the ion displacements on each lattice site ( unit cell ) @xmath10 of the @xmath11-th monolayer in the fe - layer can be described by two values @xmath12 of a pseudospin operator @xmath13",
    ". the spontaneous polarization below the ferroelectric curie temperature @xmath14 can then be modelled by an ising - type hamiltonian on the cubic lattice @xcite : @xmath15 , where the summation ranges over all nearest neighboring sites ; @xmath16 denotes the internal dipolar interaction potential .",
    "the local polarization is given by the thermal average of @xmath17 and is assumed to depend only on the monolayer index @xmath11 : @xmath18 .",
    "+ ( ii ) in the superconducting film , we consider a bcs - like pairing in the planes @xmath19 : @xmath20 the planes are coupled via the interplanar tunneling of the bosonlike pairs , @xmath21 where the pair operators are @xmath22 , the operator @xmath23 creates an electron with spin @xmath24 and impulse @xmath25 in the @xmath26-th plane , and @xmath27 . in ( [ h_s ] )",
    ", @xmath28 refers to the electron band energy with lattice constant @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the chemical potential . assuming that some amount of charge @xmath31 is either injected into the s - film from the electrodes or already exists due to chemical doping , we concentrate here _ on the effect of the carrier redistribution between the s - planes _ due to the contact polarization . for @xmath32-wave pairing ,",
    "the superconducting pairing amplitude in each plane is : @xmath33 , with the effective pairing potential @xmath34 .",
    "+ ( iii ) at the interface we describe the screening of the surface charge due to the fe - polarization on the surfaces @xmath35 and @xmath36 by the electrons of the s - film .",
    "we consider here only the electrostatic interaction with the electron density of the boundary s - planes @xmath37 and @xmath38 given by the electron number operators @xmath39 @xcite , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the charge - ferroelectric dipole interaction energy .",
    "note that , as the screening length in the cuprate superconductors is about 1  nm , the s - planes close to the boundary s - planes should also be taken into account in ( [ h_int ] ) in the multilayered cuprates containing more than one cuo@xmath42 plane in the unit cell@xcite with a distance @xmath43  @xmath44 between the planes .",
    "furthermore , we focus here on the case where the fe - layers are far below the curie temperature @xmath14 . for this case",
    ", we neglect the polarization fluctuations and rewrite the energy @xmath45 in the mean - field approximation , whereas the quasiparticle energies for each given configuration @xmath46 are found by exact numerical diagonalization of the effective s - film energy @xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding set of the order parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 is calculated selfconsistently by minimization of the system free energy . as a result",
    ", the proposed procedure describes the inner charge redistribution between the planes of an s - film in effective polarized medium on the boundaries .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the electron - dipole interaction @xmath50 ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the electronic and the net fe - unit cell charges ) depends on the distance @xmath53 between the nearest fe - monolayers and s - planes .",
    "it depends also on the ionic displacement amplitude @xmath54 in the fe - unit cell .",
    "for instance , at @xmath55   , for a bst - layer with polarization @xmath56  @xmath30c@xmath57 and @xmath58   , we obtain @xmath59  ev , whereas for @xmath60  (like in linbo@xmath4 ) we get @xmath61  ev . a comparison with the case of a fe - s bilayer is easily provided by fixing the coupling @xmath41 at one of the contacts to zero . in our calculations , we take the pairing potential @xmath62 independent of @xmath26 . considering the ideal surfaces",
    ", we should note that in sufets the surface roughness leads to the interface steps with a height @xmath63 unit cell of srtio@xmath4 as reported in ref .  .",
    "in the ultrathin s - films , such a step can act as a weak link and strongly affect the in - plane transport @xcite .",
    "as long as @xmath64 does not exceed the interplanar distance in the s - film , we can expect our results to not be significantly affected by the rough interfaces , but the problem of transport in this case needs more careful analysis .",
    "the selfconsistent solutions show stabilization of two different ferroelectric phases ( + ) and ( @xmath65 ) ( discussed in details in ref .  ) with decreasing temperature @xmath66 , depending on the electron concentration @xmath67 and @xmath41 . in phase ( + )",
    "( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , the electric dipoles have the same orientation in each fe - layer ( as shown in the inset of fig .  [ fig3](a ) ) , and the substantial deviations of the two possible solutions for @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) due to the electron screening ( [ h_int ] ) appear close to the interfaces and decay exponentially beyond the distance of about the ferroelectric correlation length@xcite . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the polarization is also suppressed for smaller fe - layer thickness due to the depolarization field @xmath70 acting on each dipole @xmath13 , however the suppression obtained here is not as crucial as in ref .",
    "and we still find a nonzero @xmath68 for a layer with @xmath71 monolayers .",
    "to get stronger suppression for a concrete fe - compound , one should consider more realistic long - range dipole - dipole interactions @xcite as well as strain effects .",
    "nevertheless , we expect our main results related to the superconducting properties robust , since we consider the coupling @xmath41 in the range @xmath72 ( @xmath73  ev for superconducting cuprates ) which corresponds to the polarization @xmath74",
    "@xmath30c@xmath57 obtained in ref .",
    "for fe - films of about 10  nm thickness . also , taking into account the @xmath68-fluctuations , would suppress the mean - field values of @xmath68 considered in this work as an upper boundary for polarization profiles . with increasing coupling @xmath41 ( @xmath75 ) and for higher electron densities @xmath76 ,",
    "a transition into the ferroelectric phase ( @xmath65 ) occurs .",
    "the fluctuating polarization domains@xcite appearing in the phase ( @xmath65 ) , are a property of the ising model in thin films . however , in a specific ferroelectric material these domains could be suppressed due to stronger depolarization fields @xcite . as the modulation of charge density in this state is much weaker than in phase ( + ) ,",
    "we focus here only on the polarization in the phase ( + ) which is of crucial importance for the superconducting properties .",
    "in the phase ( + ) , the polarization @xmath77 attracts the charge in the plane @xmath37 ( @xmath78 ) while @xmath79 decreases ( @xmath80 ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) . at low temperatures , the charge density redistribution due to @xmath81 , can be described by the difference @xmath82 .",
    "consequently , the solution @xmath83 leads to @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the bilayer system , the same direction of @xmath68 in the second fe - layer , say , @xmath85 , repels the charge near the right contact and pushes it towards the accumulation region at the left contact , acting as _ an additional driving force _ for the charge supply into the accumulation plane @xmath37 .",
    "this results in @xmath86 and @xmath87 which is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    to understand the effect of the inter - planar charge redistribution on the superconducting transition temperature @xmath5 , we consider the case @xmath88 . with the interplanar tunneling @xmath89",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ h_s])-([h_int ] ) leads to two gap equations in the planes @xmath26 . for @xmath32-wave symmetry , different local @xmath5",
    "are found : @xmath90 due to the factor @xmath91 caused by the contact polarization .",
    "hence , for low band filling ( @xmath92 ) and for @xmath85 , one finds that @xmath93 and @xmath94 , since the gaps @xmath95 are comparable in energy to @xmath96 . for @xmath97 ,",
    "this leads to a normal state in the plane @xmath98 , whereas the plane @xmath37 is still superconducting .",
    "however , due to the interplanar coupling , even slightly above @xmath99 , the superconducting plane @xmath37 still induces a nonzero @xmath100 for @xmath101 stabilizing the superconductivity in the entire s - film .",
    "this effect can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) from the numerical solution of the gap equations for @xmath102 . for @xmath103 , both gaps @xmath104 and",
    "@xmath105 vanish at a common @xmath106 which is higher than the local @xmath99 calculated for @xmath107 .",
    "the enhancement of the pairing on the planes without the pairing interaction solely due to the interplanar coupling is a well known property discussed in the literature@xcite . in our case , however , the interplanar tunneling plays not only the role of an enhancement factor , but also provides a way for the accumulation of charge and stronger pairing in the accumulation s - plane caused by the polarization . in the multilayers , due to the stronger redistribution of the charge described by @xmath108",
    ", the last property leads to @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) . for stronger coupling ,",
    "the increase of @xmath5 in the multilayer is also substantially stronger than that in the bilayer .",
    "the strongest increase of @xmath5 caused by @xmath68 can be achieved for low @xmath111 ; compared to the case @xmath112 ( isolated the s - layer ) , we find a @xmath113 increase of @xmath5 with @xmath114 for @xmath115 , see fig .",
    "to estimate the effect of @xmath68 for @xmath116 , we rewrite the interplanar coupling in ( [ h_t ] ) in the mean - field approximation and for @xmath88 introduce the order parameters as @xmath117 where the susceptibilities @xmath118 , @xmath119 are the eigenvalues of the mean - field superconducting hamiltonian , and @xmath120 .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the inter - layer tunneling @xmath121 is introduced in a more generalized form so that the coherent tunneling ( [ h_t ] ) corresponds to @xmath122 . as the field effect is expected to be stronger in high - t@xmath0 superconductors , we consider further the two cases of @xmath32- and @xmath123-wave pairing with the ansatz @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 in ( [ delta_t ] ) . here",
    "@xmath127 for the @xmath32-wave and @xmath128 for the @xmath123-wave pairing symmetry . as for @xmath85",
    "we have @xmath94 in the case of isolated s - planes , we assume that the second term in the r.h.s . of the second equation ( [ delta_t ] )",
    "determining @xmath105 is dominant and substitute it into the first equation for @xmath104 .",
    "the resulting quadratic equation has the following solution for small @xmath129 : @xmath130 which corresponds in fact to the upper local transition temperature given in ( [ tc_local ] ) in the limit @xmath89 .",
    "however , in contrast to the expressions ( [ tc_local ] ) , here due to the inter - planar coupling we note three important features : ( i ) as analyzed in the literature , the pairing interaction is increased : @xmath131 ; ( ii ) the factor @xmath132 always leads to an increase of @xmath5 and does not depend on the direction of @xmath68 , demonstrating that the enhancement of @xmath5 is essentially due to the s - planes with the dominant pairing ( those with the higher local @xmath96 in ( [ tc_local ] ) ) ; ( iii ) interestingly , the stronger inter - planar coupling makes the field - effect slightly weaker , since the contribution of @xmath133 in ( [ tc_global ] ) decreases with the @xmath134 increase .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the same effect , i.e. the slightly weaker increase of @xmath5 for larger @xmath134 is also seen in the numerical solution of ( [ delta_t ] ) .",
    "the most striking fact , however , is that the coupling with the polarization leads to a much stronger increase of @xmath5 in the case of @xmath123-wave pairing when compared to @xmath32-wave , shown in fig .",
    "this result suggests that _ not only the larger screening length , but also the pairing symmetry should be responsible for the much stronger electric field effect in the high - temperature superconductors _ in comparison with the conventional compounds .",
    "also , the difference between the @xmath5 in the bilayers and sandwiches for the @xmath123-wave symmetry is much more pronounced which allows us to expect further progress in the field - effect experiments performed with fe - s - fe sandwiches .",
    "having demonstrated the advantages of sandwiches , we propose a design of a field - effect transistor based on the confined fe - s - fe geometry .",
    "the power supply moves the opposite charge to the fe - gate electrodes .",
    "the operational principle of such an sufet consists of two stages : ( i ) the superconducting state with the enhanced @xmath5 can be reached in the regime where the system has the same direction of @xmath68 in each fe - layer , as illustrated in fig .",
    "note that for the fixed @xmath111 , the antiparallel polarization in the fe - gates leads to lower charge densities in the accumulation region and consequently to the lower @xmath135 which is discussed in ref .  .",
    "( ii ) to switch the sufet into the insulating state , it is sufficient to destroy the accumulation layer at the first fe - s contact .",
    "this can be realized by switching the voltage @xmath136 and tuning the polarization in the fe - layers to zero .",
    "= 7.5 cm    due to the simple geometry , even at the current stage of fabrication techniques , the proposed sufets can be designed and experimentally probed with oxide films as the most promising candidates for high - temperature superconducting electronics . from the above results we expect that in the proposed sufets also the effect of charge tunneling between the cuo@xmath42-planes could be tested in single- and especially in multilayered cuprates with inhomogeneous carrier distribution@xcite .    in conclusions",
    ", we have shown that the fe - polarization in fe - s multilayers leads to much stronger modulation of inner carrier density and superconducting properties as compared to the bilayers .",
