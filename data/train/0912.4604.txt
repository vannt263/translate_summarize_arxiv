    "as is widely recognized , the ads / cft correspondence @xcite is an efficient tool for the nonperturbative analysis of various problems , providing a new insight in the underlying physical mechanisms and relating classical and quantum domains in relevant weak and strong coupling regimes .",
    "it is natural , therefore , to look for new applications where the hypothesis of this ( or a similar ) correspondence can work and bring new nonperturbative results .",
    "this becomes even more interesting in the context of a recently suggested relation between the cutoff in classical black hole physics and the properties of a particle model @xcite , establishing the dependence of this cutoff on the number of quantum species @xmath0 in the theory .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence relates dual models in the domains of couplings separated by this cutoff and , thus , directly involves this concept .",
    "together with the hierarchy problem of the electroweak vs planckian scales @xcite , one of the most intriguing implications of these ideas concerns problems in early and late cosmology ranging from the origin of inflationary universe to the dark energy . in this sense ,",
    "a recently suggested cosmological model driven by a conformal field theory ( cft ) with a large number of conformal fields @xcite is a perfect tool for such a duality analysis .",
    "this model is of a particular interest , because it incorporates a microcanonical initial conditions in cosmology , capable of resolving the string landscape problem , and possibly contains a mechanism for the cosmological acceleration @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that this essentially quantum four - dimensional ( 4d ) model has a dual description in terms of a classical 5d theory incorporating a dynamically evolving 4d brane with brane induced gravity in a schwarzschild-_de sitter",
    "_ 5d bulk ( what we will call here the generalized dgp model ) .",
    "the parameters of this model  its cosmological constant @xmath1 and the black hole mass belong to the classical domain much below the cutoff , whereas the 4d cosmology of @xcite on the cft side of the duality relation lies close to the upper boundary of the admissible range of values for the 4d cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "this range was derived in @xcite and suggested to be of interest for dealing with the string landscape and the cosmological constant problem .",
    "distinctive peculiarities of this _ dgp / cft correspondence _ is that it is realized not on the ads background , but on the schwarzschild-_de sitter _ one , and does not resort to group - theoretical and , in particular , supersymmetry arguments .",
    "moreover , the parameters of the system ( that is its cosmological constant @xmath3 , temperature and the radiation energy or the black hole mass on the 5d side ) are not freely specifiable , but are entirely determined in terms of the planck mass by the particle content of the model .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sect.2",
    "we recapitulate the construction of the cft driven cosmology of @xcite , its initial conditions prescribed by the microcanonical density matrix and late time evolution incorporating the cosmological acceleration in the form of the big boost scenario @xcite . in sect.3 we discuss the single branch generalized dgp model with a positive @xmath1 in the bulk , which for the vacuum case was observed in @xcite to be equivalent to the cft cosmology .",
    "sect.4 presents the derivation of this equivalence in the euclidean signature spacetime which underlies the 4d cosmological instantons dominating the statistical sum path integral . on the 5d side",
    "these instantons represent a dynamically evolving brane embedded into the schwarzschild - de sitter bulk with @xmath3 , its black hole mass being related to the thermal radiation on the brane .",
    "complete duality of 4d and 5d descriptions implies the specification of the cosmological constant and the radiation energy , which on the 4d side follows from the quantum einstein equations and on the 5d side is enforced by the requirement of the absence of conical singularity in the bulk geometry .",
    "together these conditions select from the finite range of @xmath2 , admissible from the 4d viewpoint , a value close to the upper limit of this range , where the gravitating cft belongs to a strong coupling regime treated within @xmath4-expansion .",
    "this property is derived in sect.5 for a special set of static einstein instantons of the cft cosmology and for the non - static solutions called _ garlands _ in @xcite  the instantons giving rise to expanding inflationary models .",
    "sect.6 contains an attempt to generalize this dgp / cft correspondence to the case of the _ background independent _ formulation , when the field configuration is not limited by symmetry or weak field linearization restrictions  an idea suggested in @xcite on the basis of quantum information and gravity cutoff bounds .",
    "in particular , it is shown that a full nonlinear trace part of effective einstein equations can be exactly the same on both sides of the duality relation .",
    "this turns out to be true under the assumption of a particle phenomenology motivated by the superconformal @xmath5 yang - mills theory which underlies the @xmath6 correspondence of @xcite . in sect.7",
    "we discuss an interesting mechanism based on the conformal anomaly to reverse the sign of the primordial negative cosmological constant .",
    "this could reconcile supersymmetry with inflation .",
    "sect.8 contains conclusions and a brief discussion of the results .",
    "the initial conditions for the cft driven cosmology of @xcite were prescribed in terms of * a * microcanonical density matrix . they are based on the corresponding statistical sum for a spatially closed cosmology ( @xmath7-topology of spatial sections ) .",
    "it is represented by the path integral over the periodic scale factor @xmath8 and lapse function @xmath9 of the minisuperspace metric @xmath10 on the toroidal spacetime of @xmath11 topology @xmath12\\ ;      e^{-\\vargamma_e[\\,a,\\,n\\,]}.    \\label{1 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 $ ] is the euclidean effective action of all inhomogeneous",

    "this action incorporates the integration over all degrees of freedom of the system not contained in its minisuperspace sector .    under the assumption that the system is dominated by free matter fields conformally coupled to gravity",
    "this action is exactly calculable by the conformal transformation converting ( [ frw ] ) into the static einstein metric with @xmath16 @xcite . in units of the planck mass",

    "it reads @xcite @xmath36    the status of other coefficients of ( [ anomaly ] ) is as follows .",
    "the coefficient @xmath37 does not contribute to ( [ effaction ] ) because the weyl tensor vanishes for any frw metric .",
    "a nonvanishing @xmath38 induces higher derivative terms @xmath39 in the action and , therefore , adds one extra degree of freedom to the minisuperspace sector of @xmath40 and @xmath0 which generically leads to instabilities in the einstein lagrangian .",
    "addition of higher derivative term for @xmath40 does not necessarily lead to a ghost  the additional degree of freedom can have a good sign of the kinetic term as it happens in @xmath41-theories , but still leads to the instabilities discovered in @xcite . ] . but @xmath38 can be renormalized to zero by adding a finite _ local _ counterterm @xmath42 admissible by the renormalization theory .",
    "such a _ number of degrees of freedom preserving _ renormalization was assumed in @xcite to keep the theory consistent both at the classical and quantum levels .",
    "it is important that this finite renormalization changes the value of the casimir energy of conformal fields in closed einstein cosmology in such a way that for all spins this energy is universally expressed in terms of the same conformal anomaly coefficient @xmath22 ( corresponding to the @xmath43 term in ( [ effaction ] ) ) @xcite  the casimir energy is entirely determined by the conformal anomaly coefficients @xcite .",
    "we thank p.mazur and e.mottola for the discussion of this point . ] .    the path integral ( [ 1 ] )",
    "is dominated by saddle points  solutions of the equation @xmath44 which reads as @xmath45 with @xmath46 given by @xmath47 this euclidean friedmann equation is modified by the anomalous @xmath22-term and the radiation term @xmath48 .",
    "the constant @xmath49 sets the amount of radiation and determines the energy of the gas of thermally excited particles with the inverse temperature @xmath26  the instanton period in units of the conformal time .",
    "the latter is given in ( [ bootstrap ] ) by the integral over the full period of @xmath50 or the @xmath51-fold integral between the two neighboring turning points of the scale factor history @xmath8 , @xmath52 .",
    "this @xmath53-fold nature implies that in the periodic solution the scale factor oscillates @xmath53 times between its maximum and minimum values @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 thus , the period of the solutions is determined as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath15 from the second of eqs.([bootstrap ] ) and is not freely specifiable .",
    "this is the artifact of a microcanonical ensemble ( see @xcite ) with only two freely specifiable dimensional parameters  the renormalized gravitational and renormalized cosmological constants .",
    "as shown in @xcite , such solutions represent @xmath57 garland - type instantons which exist only in the limited range of the cosmological constant @xmath58 @xmath59 in this range they form an infinite @xmath60 sequence of one - parameter families depicted in fig.[fig.1 ] in the two - dimensional plane of the hubble constant @xmath61 and the amount of radiation constant @xmath62 ( including together with the energy of the radiation gas @xmath46 , see ( [ bootstrap ] ) , also the casimir energy constant @xmath63 . )",
    "these families interpolate between the two boundaries of a curvilinear triangle of the instanton domain in the @xmath64-plane  the lower straight line boundary @xmath65 and the upper hyperbolic boundary @xmath66 .",
    "their sequence at @xmath67 accumulates at the corner of this triangle  the upper bound of the range ( [ landscape ] ) @xmath68 .",
    "8.5 cm    this bound represents a new quantum gravity scale which tends to infinity when one switches the quantum effects off , @xmath69 .",
    "the lower bound @xmath70  the lowest point of @xmath71 family  can be obtained numerically for any field content of the model . for a large number of conformal fields @xmath0 , and therefore a large @xmath72 , the lower bound is of the order @xmath73 .",
    "thus the restriction ( [ landscape ] ) suggests a kind of @xmath4 solution of the cosmological constant problem , because specifying a sufficiently high number of conformal fields one can achieve a primordial value of @xmath15 well below the planck scale where the effective theory applies , but high enough to generate a sufficiently long inflationary stage .",
    "also this restriction can be potentially considered as a selection criterion for the landscape of string vacua @xcite .",
    "the solutions of the system ( [ efeq])-([bootstrap ] ) include the vacuum hartle - hawking instantons of @xcite ( see their dual braneworld description in @xcite ) with no radiation @xmath74 .",
    "they represent the euclidean de sitter spacetime with the effective hubble factor @xmath75 corresponding to the degenerate case when a torus @xmath57 gets ripped at the vanishing value of the scale factor @xmath76 and topologically becomes a 4-sphere @xmath77  a purely vacuum contribution to the statistical sum .",
    "the vacuum nature of these instantons follows from the fact that their conformal time period in ( [ bootstrap ] ) is divergent at @xmath78 in view of @xmath76 and generates zero effective temperature @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "such solutions exist for all @xmath81 ( the horizontal segment at @xmath82 in fig.[fig.1 ] ) , but they are ruled out in the statistical sum by their infinite _ positive _ effective action .",
    "this property is due to the contribution of the conformal anomaly ( cf .",
    "@xmath83-dependence in the kinetic @xmath22-terms of the effective action ( [ effaction ] ) ) ) @xmath84 , and the integrand of ( [ effaction ] ) tends to @xmath85 at @xmath78 with @xmath86 . in its turn , the absence of a conical singularity at the cap of the @xmath77 instanton follows from a special uv renormalization which eradicates higher - order derivatives from the effective friedmann equation and simultaneously renders a particular value of the casimir energy @xmath63 @xcite . ] .",
    "hence the tree - level predictions of the theory with a negative euclidean action are drastically changed by the effect of the conformal anomaly .",
    "the solutions of ( [ efeq])-([bootstrap ] ) also include the exactly static instantons with @xmath87 which occupy the full upper hyperbolic boundary of the instanton domain in fig.[fig.1 ] .",
    "they exist for all @xmath61 from the range ( [ landscape ] ) , but they are not interesting from the viewpoint of the early universe , because they stay static and do not give rise to expanding cosmological models . as they serve as a simple working tool for the dgp / cft selection rules , they will be considered in much detail in sect.5 below",

    "also it shows that the casimir energy that was initially present in the effective action ( [ effaction ] ) , the term @xmath95 , does not weigh . in a static einstein universe",
    "this energy component has the same equation of state as radiation @xcite , but in contrast to the real radiation with the planck ( or bose - fermi ) spectrum ( [ bootstrap ] ) it does not enter the right hand side of ( [ friedmanne ] ) .",
    "this degravitation is a result of the number of degrees of freedom preserving renormalization mentioned above .",
    "the gravitational instantons of the above type serve as a source of initial conditions for the cosmological evolution in the physical spacetime .",

    "a particle production of a conformally non - invariant matter takes over the polarization effects of conformal fields . after the thermalization this matter gives rise to an energy density @xmath101 which replaces in ( [ friedmannl ] ) the energy density of the primordial cosmological constant and radiation , @xmath102 .",

    "the fact that the cft driven cosmology of the above type has a dual braneworld description was first observed in @xcite .",
    "the dual picture is given by a generalized dgp model @xcite including together with 4d and 5d einstein - hilbert terms also a 5d cosmological constant , @xmath1 , in the special case of a _ vacuum _ state with a vanishing matter density on the brane .",
    "interestingly , this vacuum dgp cosmology _ exactly _ corresponds to the model of @xcite with the 4d cosmological constant @xmath15 simulated by the 5d cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , in this model ( provided one neglects the bulk curvature ) , gravity interpolates between a 4d behaviour at small distances and a 5d behaviour at large distances , with the crossover scale between the two regimes being given by @xmath107 , @xmath108 and in the absence of stress - energy exchange between the brane and the bulk , the modified friedmann equation takes the form @xcite @xmath109 here @xmath110 is the integration of the bulk einstein s equation , which corresponds to a nonvanishing weyl tensor in the bulk ( or a mass of the 5d schwarzschild black hole ) @xcite and @xmath111 is the energy density on the brane .",
    "this equation with @xmath112 exactly coincides with the lorentzian version of the effective friedmann equation in the cft cosmology ( [ efeq ] ) under the identifications @xmath113 these identifications imply that in the dgp limit @xmath114 , the anomaly coefficient @xmath28 is much larger than 1 , and this looks very much like the generation of the vacuum dgp model for any value of the dark radiation @xmath48 from the cft cosmology with a very large @xmath115 .",
    "however , there are several differences .",
    "first , the cft driven dgp model does not incorporate the self - accelerating branch @xcite of the conventional dgp cosmology .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that only one sign of the square root is admissible in eq.([friedmannl ] )  a property dictated by the instanton initial conditions at the nucleation of the lorentzian spacetime from the euclidean one .",
    "so , one does not have to worry about possible instabilities associated with the self - accelerating branch @xcite .",
    "another difference concerns the way the matter energy density manifests itself in the friedmann equation for the non - vacuum case . in the cft model",
    "it enters the right hand side of the equation as a result of the decay of the effective 4d cosmological constant @xmath15 resulting in ( [ modfriedmann ] ) . in the conventional dgp model it appears inside the parenthesis of the left hand side of equation ( [ friedmanndgp ] ) , so that the dgp hubble factor reads as @xmath116 ( note the negative sign of @xmath111 under the square root and the extra first term on the right hand side ) .    due to the presence of the cosmological constant in the bulk",
    "this generalized dgp model also admits the big boost acceleration scenario @xcite .",
    "indeed , for positive @xmath1 satisfying a very weak bound @xmath117 eq.([modfriedmanndgp ] ) has a solution for which , during the cosmological expansion with @xmath118 , @xmath119 , the argument of the square root vanishes and the acceleration tends to infinity . for that to happen , one does not actually need a growing @xmath107 or @xmath28 , like in the cft driven model above ( see the end of the previous section ) .",
    "the dgp crossover scale @xmath107 can be constant , and the big boost singularity will still occur provided the lower bound ( [ bound ] ) is satisfied . for a positive @xmath1 below this bound ,",
    "the acceleration stage is eternal with an asymptotic value of the hubble factor given by @xmath120 whereas for @xmath121 the model bounces from some maximal value of a scale factor and starts recollapsing .",

    "the latter involves the jump of the trace of the extrinsic curvature across the brane @xmath128=2k$ ] .",

    "this killing coordinate of the 5d metric plays the role of the angular coordinate which should be identified with the period prescribed by the periodicity of the embedded brane @xmath158 where @xmath53 in the second equality arises for the k - fold garland case with @xmath53 oscillations of @xmath8 between its minimal and maximal values .",
    "on the other hand , the period of @xmath157 dictated by the absence of a conical singularity at @xmath154 equals ( @xmath159 ) @xmath160 as is known @xcite these two periods for the schwarzschild - de sitter solution can be identified only for the degenerate case of coinciding sizes of schwarzschild and de sitter horizons @xmath161 , which is interpreted as the equilibrium of hawking radiation flows emitted by these two horizon surfaces . in view of ( [ r_-<r_+ ] ) this is impossible in our case , so that both conical singularities can not be simultaneously eliminated .",
    "however , in the presence of the brane ( with the @xmath124-identification across it ) only the region of sds spacetime @xmath162 remains ( see fig.[fig.3 ] ) .",
    "10 cm    therefore , a natural selection criterion for the regularity at the desitter horizon @xmath163 becomes just one equation relating @xmath164 and @xmath165 @xmath166 this is an equation on @xmath167 in terms of @xmath61 and @xmath22 analogous to the bootstrap equation ( [ bootstrap ] ) on the 4d cft side of this problem .",
    "it does not however coincide with ( [ bootstrap ] ) , so that the suggested dgp / cft duality does not incorporate a complete equivalence of 4d and 5d pictures for the full admissible range of @xmath58 on the cft side .",

    "note that the period for the coneless case has a very limited range @xmath189 in which the evaluation of @xmath24 , ( [ freeenergy ] ) , with a big accuracy is given by the contribution of several lowest oscillator levels @xmath25 .",
    "the numerical solution of this equation does not present any difficulty , and it gives , for a pure scalar field with @xmath190 @xmath191 ( the corresponding thermal sum of ( [ bootstrap ] ) runs over the eigenfrequencies on a unit 3-sphere @xmath192 with weights @xmath193 ) .    for a pure 2-component weyl spinor field with @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196",
    "we have @xmath197 and for a pure vector field with @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 @xmath201 interestingly , for spinors and vectors the cone free instantons are very close to the upper bound of the range ( [ landscape ] )  the new quantum gravity scale @xmath68 .",
    "when the cft is composed of many fields of one spin , these values do not depend on their number @xmath0 ( because @xmath0 cancels out in the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) . in the case of the mixture of spins , they depend on the partial weights of these spins in the full system",
    ". then the resulting value of @xmath188 lies somewhere between ( [ coneless0 ] ) and ( [ coneless1 ] ) .",
    "thus , only one member of the static einstein family with @xmath202 remains in a dual dgp / cft description , which again eliminates the infrared catastrophe of @xmath203 ( even though this catastrophe for this family is irrelevant from the viewpoint of early cosmology ) .",
    "application of the same criterion of dual description to garland families by the combination of eqs.([cone ] ) and ( [ bootstrap ] ) also restricts them to a finite set ( intersection of the one - parameter set of solutions of ( [ cone ] ) with one - parameter sets of garlands ) . in view of the irreducible integral nature of these equations",
    "this can hardly be done analytically .",
    "numerical calculations show that for the scalar field there is a single member of the @xmath204 garland family with the following value of the hubble constant and the amount of radiation constant @xmath205 in fact this instanton is rather close to the static instanton of ( [ coneless0 ] ) .    for other spins and their mixtures we do not have concrete results , but it is expected that a dual description also exists for a finite set of garlands with isolated values of the cosmological constant . this problem will be analyzed elsewhere .",
    "in particular , it is anticipated that , when vector and spinor contributions dominate in the particle phenomenology , the dgp / cft duality will enforce the values of the cosmological and amount of radiation constants close to ( [ coneless1/2])-([coneless1 ] ) , that is very close to the upper boundary of the range ( [ landscape ] ) .",
    "this duality is very much equivalent to the ads / cft correspondence picture not only from the viewpoint of classical - to - quantum correspondence , but also from the viewpoint of energy scales of the problems . indeed , on the cft cosmology side the limit @xmath206 corresponds to the uppermost possible value of @xmath15 .",
    "with the number of conformal fields @xmath207 the corresponding @xmath208 is small , but it still turns out to be in a strong coupling limit  at the cutoff generated in gravitational physics by a large number of quantum species @xcite . on the 5d side , however , we have for large @xmath0 large semiclassical black holes .",
    "this follows from the fact that for large @xmath209 the black hole horizon in the vicinity of the family of solutions ( [ static ] ) can be estimated as @xmath210 because the radiation to vacuum energy ratio ( [ ratio ] ) is a quantity essentially independent of the total @xmath0 .",
    "thus , this is a nearly classical black hole provided the number of species is larger than @xmath211 .",
    "moreover the dynamics of the brane cosmology takes place at @xmath212 far away from the bh horizon , where quantum effects of the bulk background are even weaker .",
    "the duality between the 4d cft setting and 5d braneworld setup holds in a cosmological sector , with degrees of freedom which are spatially homogeneous collective variables .",
    "the duality between both models is far from being obvious when those degrees of freedom are not restricted to be homogeneous , as is the case for the background cosmology , but are also free to contain spatially inhomogeneous modes .",
    "this can be checked only by comparing relevant sets of correlation functions considered within perturbation theory on this background .",
    "however , the duality construction of the above type can be considered as a step towards _ background independent _ classical - to - quantum correspondence between the theories in neighboring spacetime dimensions @xcite .",
    "our case goes beyond a conventional ads / cft correspondence , where the bulk schwarzschild - ads background and its asymptotically remote boundary are in fact non - dynamical ( being a trivial static solution of 10d sugra equations parameterized by fixed coupling constants ) . here the 4d thermal brane is located at a finite variable distance from the bh and undergoes a nontrivial evolution in the bulk background .",
    "the latter is static but involves the bh mass ( and the relevant amount of radiation on the brane ) which is not a free input but rather a quantity fixed by nontrivial consistency conditions .",
    "moreover , this model contains the indication that this duality can be extended further , beyond any assumptions on spacetime symmetries of the underlying background .",
    "as we will see , a part of the full nonlinear equations in both settings of this model coincide irrespective of the particular symmetry ansatz for the physical configurations . to show this ,",
    "consider the einstein equations with israel boundary ( junction ) conditions ( [ bulkeinstein])-([surfacestress ] ) . with the dgp scale parameter ( [ dgpscale ] )",
    "the junction conditions can be rewritten as @xmath213 and the gravitational constraint in the bulk  the normal - normal projection of ( [ bulkeinstein ] ) , @xmath214 takes the form of the following equation entirely in terms of 4d brane quantities @xmath215 because the quadratic form in the extrinsic curvature reads as @xmath216  a structure related by a total derivative term to the square of the weyl tensor .",
    "thus , unexpected conformal properties start popping out in this seemingly unrelated to conformal invariance braneworld setup .",
    "the _ tree - level _ equation ( [ 5dside ] ) is exact and totally independent of any background ansatz restrictions .",
    "let us now consider the _ quantum effective _",
    "equations on the 4d cft side . without any symmetry assumptions and selection of collective variables the full effective action in the theory ( in the @xmath4-approximation ) can be represented as a sum of einstein term , the conformal anomaly action @xmath31 and conformally invariant part including the action for thermal radiation and vacuum ( casimir ) energy @xmath217 @xmath218    now consider the conformal variation of this action or the trace part of effective einstein equations .",
    "we will assume that , as before , the number of degrees of freedom preserving renormalization has been done , so that the conformal variation of the anomalous action has the form ( [ anomaly ] ) with the coefficient of the @xmath219 term @xmath220 . with a known equation for the gauss - bonnet invariant @xmath221 in terms of the weyl tensor @xmath222 this anomalous variation reads @xmath223 .",
    "\\label{anomaly1 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , in view of the local conformal invariance of @xmath217 the full trace effective equation @xmath224 takes the form @xmath225    under the known indentifications of the 4d and 5d parameters ( [ 1000])-([1001 ] ) , the first three terms here exactly reproduce the equation ( [ 5dside ] ) on a 5d braneworld side  the tree - level generalized dgp model . for a cosmological setting with a conformally flat frw metric the last term is vanishing , but for a generic field configurations",
    "it is nonzero , and these 5d and 4d pictures are generally not dual .",
    "however , salvation might come from the supersymmetry requirement .",
    "it is a well - known fact that in the superconformal field theory  the @xmath226 @xmath227 sym with an extended @xmath5 supersymmetry @xcite , which is a typical object of ads / cft correspondence with the particle contents @xmath228 , cf .",
    "eq.([100 ] ) ,  the coefficients of the conformal anomaly satisfy the relation @xmath229 this renders equations ( [ 5dside ] ) and ( [ 4dside ] ) completely equivalent for a generic metric configuration .",
    "in particular , the particle model with the same phenomenology when applied in our cft cosmology will provide a hierarchy of classical - to - quantum coupling scale limits ( [ classicalbh ] ) with @xmath230 .",
    "one can find for this particle content the static instanton ( on the hyperbolic curve of fig.[fig.1 ] ) satisfying the selection criteria on both 4d and 5d sides . according to the previous section",
    ", it represents a numerical solution of eq.([hviar ] ) with the conformal time ( [ conelesseta ] ) for the above set of spins with the relevant value of the total @xmath231 and the relevant thermal scalar , spinor and vector sums weighted in @xmath232 by the numbers of particles @xmath233 , cf .",
    "eq.([bootstrap ] ) .",
    "it turns out that this static instanton has the parameters @xmath234 which again nearly saturate the cutoff bound @xmath68 .",
    "apparently , the garland instanton satisfying the same criteria of a complete duality is also very close to this point , which supports the conclusions of sect.5 on the weak coupling to strong coupling correspondence of relevant 5d and 4d pictures .",
    "the previous section gives a strong motivation for the introduction of supersymmetry in the particle phenomenology of the model , which however requires negative values of the bulk and brane cosmological constants in ( [ 1001 ] ) .",
    "for this reason let us consider the case of @xmath235 we will see that this results in the flip of the sign of the _ effective _ cosmological constant , which makes this choice useful also for the use in inflation theory .    with this choice",
    "the formal turning points ( [ apm ] ) go over into @xmath236 and in view of @xmath237 the euclidean evolution of the scale factor can only be in the range @xmath238 , which corresponds to the formation of the hartle - hawking vacuum instanton with the @xmath77 topology  degenerate case of a torus ripped at the vanishing value of the scale factor .",
    "the euclidean evolution domain @xmath239 is of no interest , because it is not periodic and of no relevance to the statistical sum of the model .",
    "with @xmath240 at the boundary of the evolution domain the conformal time diverges to infinity , @xmath241 , so that @xmath242 , and @xmath243 from ( [ bootstrap ] )",
    ". then the effective friedmann equation ( [ efeq ] ) reduces to @xmath244 where the plus sign of the square root in the expression for @xmath245 is chosen to have a necessary turning point at @xmath246  the equatorial section of the spherical hartle - hawking instanton mentioned above .",
    "the solution of ( [ 50 ] ) is an obvious euclidean de sitter metric with * a * _ positive _ effective cosmological constant @xmath247 ( cf .",
    "eq.([hhheff ] ) for the hartle - hawking instanton in the case of a positive primordial @xmath58 ) .",
    "when rewritten in terms of the original negative cosmological constant ( [ negative ] ) this effective one explicitly features the sign flip @xmath248 this nonlinear transition from the negative primordial cosmological constant to the positive effective one is a genuine quantum effect of the conformal anomaly .",
    "this effect , for example , makes unnecessary the kklt uplifting @xcite of the negative vacuum energy  here the primordial cosmological constant can be negative and consistent with supersymmetry and still can generate a positive effective @xmath249 needed for inflation .",
    "unfortunately , there is an obstacle to the realization of this elegant mechanism .",
    "if we believe in the microcanonical initial conditions of the above type , then the contribution of the hartle - hawking instanton should be weighted by the exponentiated negative of the euclidean effective action .",
    "but , as mentioned above , the latter diverges to @xmath85 @xcite by virtue of the conformal anomaly part and suppresses to zero this contribution of a primordial @xmath250 .",
    "there is a hope to overcome this difficulty by using the tunneling prescription @xcite alternative to the no - boundary construction of the above type .",
    "as suggested in @xcite the tunneling state can be incorporated into the microcanonical path integral formulation in the form of another saddle point of ( [ 1 ] ) with the _ negative _ value of the lapse function @xmath251 . in the main it leads to the reversal of the sign of the semiclassical exponential in the distribution function of the quantum ensemble .",
    "but such a tunneling state was calculated in @xcite only for a system with non - conformal quantum fields with heavy masses , admitting a local gradient expansion of the effective action .",
    "the inclusion of massless conformal fields into this construction encounters certain difficulties and is currently under study .",
    "thus we have constructed a 5d braneworld setup dual to the microcanonical state of a 4d spatially closed cosmology driven by the conformal field theory with a large number of quantum fields .",
    "the importance of this model lies in the fact that it provides initial conditions for inflationary cosmology in a limited range of the effective cosmological hubble factor , which at late stages of expansion can also have a stage of the cosmological acceleration by the big boost scenario of ref .",
    "the dual 5d picture is represented by the generalized dgp model with no matter on the brane , but with a positive primordial cosmological constant in the bulk and a black hole imitating the radiation of conformal fields on the cosmological 4d cft side . for a large number of quantum cft species",
    "@xmath0 the dgp / cft duality holds for distinguished values of the cosmological constant , which correspond to the classical weak coupling regime of the 5d schwarzschild - de sitter bulk and a strong coupling regime of the 4d cft at the natural cutoff induced by large @xmath0 .",
    "this duality is fully proven for global cosmological degrees of freedom of the system , and its extension to the sector of spatially inhomogeneous modes and their perturbative correlators still has to be done .",
    "however , there is an indication that this can be done even at the level of the full nonlinear equations , because a trace part of effective einstein equations exactly coincides on both sides of the duality relation for a generic metric configuration unrestricted by any killing symmetry considerations .",
    "this only imposes constraints on particle phenomenology provided , in particular , by superconformal symmetry of the theory .",
    "this suggests a new type of background independent classical - to - quantum correspondence .",
    "finally , we proposed a mechanism for flipping the sign of the effective cosmological constant in the cft driven cosmology , which can reconcile the negative , compatible with supersymmetry , value of the primordial cosmological constant with inflationary cosmology .",
