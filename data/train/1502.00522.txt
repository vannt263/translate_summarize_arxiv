    "one widely favored mechanism for heii ionization in hii galaxies involves hot wrs ( e.g. schaerer 1996 ) . nevertheless , it has been demonstrated that nebular heii@xmath04686 does not appear to be always associated with wrs , as it is the case of the heii nebulae lmc - n44c , lmc - n159f and m33-bclmp651 , among others ( kehrig et al . 2011 and references therein ) .",
    "this indicates that wrs can not explain heii ionization in all cases , particularly at low - z ( e.g. guseva et al . 2000 ; kehrig et al .",

    ", a very large wr population is required to explain the heii - ionization budget measured ; for instance , taking the q(heii)= 10@xmath33 photon s@xmath21 for one izw18-like wce ( ch06 ) , the number of these wces needed to explain our derived q(heii)@xmath25 = ( 1.33@xmath140.08)@xmath510@xmath26 photon s@xmath21 would be @xmath28 400 . in principle , the presence of hundreds of wrs in izw18 should not be discarded on the basis of empirical arguments for reduced wr line luminosity at low - z ( ch06 ) . however , assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ; salpeter 1955 ; m@xmath34=150m@xmath35 ) and the initial mass needed for a star to certainly become a wc ( maeder & maynet 2005 ) , a cluster with @xmath28 8 times the total stellar mass of the nw region ( m@xmath36 = 2.9@xmath510@xmath37 m@xmath29 from stasiska & schaerer ( 1999 ) scaled to 18.2 mpc distance ) is required to provide @xmath28 400 wc in izw18 . also , such a high number of wrs is not supported by state - of - the - art stellar evolutionary models for single ( rotating and non - rotating ) massive stars in metal - poor environments ( leitherer et al .",
    "furthermore , given the decrease in the ratio of wr / o stars with decreasing metallicity , shown by observations and theoretical models ( maeder & meynet 2012 and references therein ) , such a large number of wrs appears clearly unreasonable considering the extremely low - z and the o star content of izw18 ( ch06 ) .",
    "all this suggests that wrs are not the sole responsible of the heii@xmath04686 emission in izw18 .",
    "the binary channel in massive star evolution is suggested to increase the wr population ( e.g. eldridge et al . 2008 ) , but the wr population in local group galaxies does not show an increased binary rate at lower - z ( e.g. foellmi et al . 2003 ; neugent & massey 2014 ) ; thus the binary channel does not seem to favour the formation of wrs at lower - z , in contrast to what we need .",
    "nevertheless , we should bear in mind the possible uncertainties yet unsolved in the models ( maeder & meynet 2012 ) .",
    "further investigation awaits the calculation of evolutionary models for binary stars at very low - z .    as mentioned before",
    ", nebular heii@xmath04686 emission observed in the spectra of hii galaxies and extragalactic hii regions has often been attributed also to shocks and x - ray sources ( e.g. pakull & mirioni 2002 ; garnett et al .",
    "1991 ; thuan & izotov 2005 ) . in",
    "the following we discuss on these two candidate sources for heii ionization in izw18 .",
    "the x - ray emission from izw18 is dominated by a single x - ray binary apparently located in the field of the nw knot ( thuan et al .",
    "we have computed a cloudy photoionization model ( ferland et al .",
    "2013 ) using as input a power - law spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with the same x - ray luminosity , column density and slope that have been reported for izw18 ( thuan et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this cloudy model gives as an output a heii@xmath04686 luminosity l@xmath23 = 10@xmath38 erg s@xmath21 which is @xmath4 100 times lower than the l@xmath23 measured .",
    "this result rules out the x - ray binary as the main source of heii ionizing photons in izw18 .",
    "we note here that the emission from x - ray ionized nebulae has been successfully reproduced by cloudy models before ( e.g. pakull & mirioni 2002 ) .",
    "guided by the existence of heii@xmath04686 emission associated with supernova remnants ( e.g. kehrig et al .",
    "2011 ) we explored the conjecture that the heii@xmath04686 region represents such a shock - ionized nebula .",
    "the [ oi]@xmath06300 line , often strong in remnants , has been frequently used as a sensitive shock - emission test ( e.g. skillman 1985 ) .",
    "we checked that , in fact , most of the [ oi]@xmath06300 emission in izw18 is concentrated on the se knot ( see the [ oi]@xmath06300 map in figure  [ maps ] ) , with only 12@xmath3 of the heii@xmath04686-emitting spectra showing [ oi]@xmath06300 flux above the 3@xmath39 detection limit .",
    "additionally , we find no evidence for [ sii ] enhancement ( a usual sign of shock excitation ; e.g. dopita & sutherland 1996 ) associated to the location of the heii@xmath04686 region ( see the [ sii ] map in figure  [ maps ] ) . therefore , the heii@xmath04686-emitting zone in izw18 is unlikely to be produced by shocks .",
    "our new observations have allowed us to empirically demonstrate why conventional heii - ionizing sources ( e.g. wrs , shocks , x - ray binaries ) can not account for the total heii - ionization budget in izw18 .",
    "what could the nebular heii@xmath04686 emission in izw18 originate from ?",
    "we have also explored the possibilty of very massive , metal - poor o stars to account for our observations of izw18 . using current wind models of very massive o stars at low - z we can derive their heii - ionizing fluxes ( kudritzki 2002 , k02 ) . according to the hottest models ( @xmath15=60,000 k ) , between 10 - 20 super - massive stars with 300m@xmath29 [ with q(heii ) @xmath13 ( 0.70 - 1.4)@xmath510@xmath40 photon",

    "we should bear in mind that an extrapolation of the imf predicting 300m@xmath29 stars remains unchecked up to now . if we consider instead the 150m@xmath29 star hottest models [ with q(heii )",

    "650 stars with 145 @xmath18 m@xmath41/m@xmath29 @xmath18 155 would require a cluster mass @xmath4 200 @xmath5 m@xmath36 .",
    "besides the q(heii)@xmath25 budget , in the heii@xmath04686 region we have measured heii@xmath04686/h@xmath1 ratios as high as 0.08 .",
    "these values appear too big to be explained even by the models for the hottest , most metal - poor super - massive 300m@xmath29 stars ( k02 ) under ionization - bounded conditions .",
    "further constraints to the observations should await the calculation of new evolutionary tracks and seds for single o stars at the metallicity of izw18 including rotation .",
    "searches for very metal - poor starbursts and popiii - hosting galaxies have been carried out in the distant universe using the heii lines ( e.g. schaerer 2008 ; cassata et al .",
    "this search is based on the high effective temperature for popiii - stars which will emit a large number of photons with energy above 54ev , and also on the expected increase of the heii recombination lines with decreasing z ( e.g. guseva et al .",
    "2000 ; schaerer 2003,2008 ) .",
    "predictions for burst models of different metallicities show how their corresponding q(heii ) can increase by up to @xmath4 10@xmath43 when going from z=10@xmath44 to 0 ( schaerer 2003 ) .",
    "these models can not explain the q(heii)@xmath25 when z @xmath2 10@xmath44 [ for a salpeter imf , m@xmath34 = 100m@xmath29 ; see table 3 in schaerer 2003 ] even assuming that the total m@xmath36 would come from heii - ionizing stars .",
    "so another more speculative possibility , to explain the derived q(heii)@xmath25 could be based on nearly metal - free ionizing stars .",
    "these stars should ionize heii via their strong uv radiation expected at nearly zero metallicity ( e.g. tumlinson & shull 2000 ; schaerer 2003 ) .    as an approximation of nearly metal - free single stars ,",
    "we have compared our observations with the heii - ionizing radiation expected from state - of - the - art models for rotating z=0 stars ( yoon , dierks & langer 2012 ) . according to these models",
    ", we found that a handful of such stars could explain our derived q(heii)@xmath25 [ e.g. @xmath4 8 - 10 stars with mass m@xmath45=150m@xmath29 or @xmath4 13 - 15 stars with m@xmath45=100m@xmath29 ; with q(heii ) @xmath13 1.4@xmath510@xmath40 ( 0.9@xmath510@xmath40 ) photon s@xmath21 for each star with m@xmath45 = 150m@xmath29(100m@xmath29 ) ] .",
    "additionally , we note that the ionizing spectra produced by these star models are harder than the ones expected from the hottest models of super - massive 300m@xmath29 stars ( k02 ) , so they would also explain the highest heii@xmath04686/h@xmath1 values observed , providing that ionization - bounded conditions are met . while gas in izw18 is very metal - deficient but not primordial , lebouteiller et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have pointed out that the hi envelope of izw18 near the nw knot contains essentially metal - free gas pockets .",
    "these gas pockets could provide the raw material for making such nearly metal - free stars .",
    "clearly , in this hypothetical scenario , these extremely metal - poor stars can not belong to the nw cluster , which hosts more chemically evolved stars .",
    "this letter reports on new optical ifs observations of the nearby dwarf galaxy izw18 .",
    "this is an extremely metal - poor system , which is our best local laboratory for probing the conditions dominating in distant low - z starbursts .",
    "our ifs data reveal for the first time the total spatial extent ( @xmath13 440 pc diameter ) of the heii@xmath04686-emitting region and corresponding total heii - ionizing photon flux in izw18 .",
    "the metal - poor sensitivity of the heii line is a primary motivation to develop diagnostics for unevolved starbursts , and strong nebular heii emission is expected to be one of the best signatures of massive popiii - stars ( e.g. schaerer 2003,2008 ) .",
    "heii emission has been observed to be more frequent at higher - z than locally ( kehrig et al .",
    "2011 ; cassata et al .",
    "thus the analysis of the origin of the heii@xmath04686 nebular line in relatively close ionized regions , which can be studied in more detail , can yield insight into the ionizing sources in the distant universe .",
    "our observations combined with stellar models predictions point out that conventional excitation sources ( e.g. wrs , shocks , x - ray binaries ) can not convincingly explain the heii - ionizing energy budget derived for izw18 .",
    "other mechanisms are probably also at work",
    ". if the heii - ionization in izw18 is due to stellar sources , these might be peculiar very hot stars ( perhaps uncommon in local starbursts but somewhat more frequent in distant galaxies ) : according to theoretical stellar models , either super - massive o stars or nearly metal - free ionizing stars could in principle account for the total q(heii)@xmath25 of izw18 .",
    "however the super - massive o stars scenario would imply a cluster mass much higher than the mass of the nw knot derived from observations . on the other hand , though metal - free gas pockets were previously reported in izw18 ( lebouteiller et al .",
    "2013 ) , we highlight that the existence of nearly metal - free ionizing stars is not yet confirmed observationally",

    "<S> we find that the heii - ionizing radiation expected from models for either low - metallicity super - massive o stars or rotating metal - free stars could account for the heii - ionization budget measured , while only the latter models could explain the highest values of heii@xmath04686/h@xmath1 observed . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such peculiar stars in izw18 is suggestive and further investigation in this regard is needed . </S>",
    "<S> this letter highlights that some of the clues of the early universe can be found here in our cosmic backyard . </S>"
