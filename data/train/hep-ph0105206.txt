    "thanks to the experimental programmes pursued at fermilab and cern , important data on weak radiative hyperon decays ( wrhds ) should be available within the next year or two .",
    "these data will provide crucial input , which will direct further attempts to understand wrhds .",
    "theoretical approaches to wrhds may be divided into two classes according to whether they ( 1 ) satisfy or ( 2 ) violate the theorem due to hara @xcite , which states that the parity - violating ( p.v . )",
    "amplitude of the @xmath1 decay should vanish in the su(3 ) limit .",
    "since the assumptions of hara s theorem are fundamental ( ie .",
    "cp conservation , gauge - invariant local field theory at hadron level , and the absence of exactly massless hadrons ) , one may be tempted to discard class ( 2 ) , and claim that any obtained violation of the theorem must result from an unjustified assumption or an erroneous calculation . yet , despite the fundamental nature of the assumptions of hara s theorem , the data seem to favour its violation @xcite .",
    "clearly , it may happen that some of these data turn out erroneous , and that the combined set of wrhd data finally agrees with the theorem .",
    "however , irrespectively of whether one rejects or admits of the possibility that hara s theorem may be violated in nature , it is important to identify the origins of the violation in any given calculation",
    ". only mathematically precise analyses may provide us with a deeper understanding of the problem , and its resolution when crucial experimental data become available .    in the quark model of kamal and riazuddin ( kr )",
    "@xcite , hara s theorem is violated in the su(3 ) limit .",
    "it has been claimed that this result is due to kr calculation being not gauge - invariant ( see @xcite and references therein ) . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , such claims are based on logically incorrect inferences .",
    "technically speaking , violation of hara s theorem in kr originates from a contribution in which the intermediate quark enters its mass shell , thus satisfying the condition for a regular free particle @xcite . since quarks are not such particles , the kr calculation must be considered unphysical , _ if taken literally_. on the other side , however , it indicates what would be needed for the violation of hara s theorem to occur in nature . since entering mass shell is a feature of asymptotic states , the kr calculation hints that the violation of hara s theorem requires some kind of nonlocality .",
    "connection with nonlocality can also be anticipated from the example of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which it is proved at hadron level that the violation of hara s theorem may occur only if the ( conserved ) electromagnetic axial baryon current exhibits some degree of nonlocality ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it may be argued that one should replace the kr approach with a model in which quarks are confined to a small region of space .",
    "hadrons should be then well described by an effective local field theory , and hara s theorem _ must _ be satisfied as its violation then requires the presence of unobserved exactly massless hadron @xcite .",
    "the problem is , however , that quark unobservability may be taken care of only using models based on what is _ expected _ of confinement , not on its calculable properties : one can not trace if and how quark unobservability modifies kr results .",
    "this means that the correctness of these expectations can not be proved or disproved .",
    "thus , we are stuck in a stalemate : in order to resolve the puzzle , we have to take quark unobservability into account . yet",
    ", we do not know how to do that properly .",
    "a possible way out consists in finding a description in which use of free or confined intermediate quarks is altogether avoided .",
    "such reasoning led to the idea of the @xmath4 approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , in which photons couple to hadrons always through intermediate vector mesons ( vector - meson dominance ( vmd ) is known to work extremely well ) .",
    "then , all unknowns related to quark - level problems are hidden in the p.v . meson - baryon couplings .",
    "the merit of this approach is that the latter couplings are experimentally accessible in nuclear p.v . processes . on the other hand",
    ", the use of vmd may be considered questionable : ref .",
    "@xcite attributes violation of hara s theorem in @xcite to the lack of gauge invariance .",
    "the question of gauge invariance arises when vmd is understood in a dynamical sense with vector mesons mediating the coupling .",
    "still , even if one rejects the klz scheme @xcite ensuring gauge invariance of vmd , the explanation of the violation of hara s theorem in refs .",
    "@xcite by gauge noninvariance of the underlying calculations is incorrect .",
    "proving this is one of the goals of the present paper .    in this paper ( sections 2,3 )",
    "it is shown that the basic results of refs .",
    "@xcite are _ independent _ of the above dynamical understanding of vmd and hold also for manifestly gauge - invariant direct photon - quark coupling .",
    "consequently , the violation of hara s theorem obtained in @xcite has nothing to do with gauge noninvariance .    in section 4 the whole scheme and , in particular ,",
    "the pattern of wrhd asymmetries are cross - checked against the pcac approach to nlhds .",
    "it is shown that if the current algebra ( ca ) commutator in nlhds is nonzero , the approach leads to the violation of hara s theorem , while predicting large positive asymmetry of the @xmath2 decay .",
    "it is stressed that negative @xmath2 asymmetry ( automatically consistent with hara s theorem ) would present a serious problem for the quark model .",
    "the decisive role of the sign of the @xmath2 asymmetry as far as the issue of the violation of hara s theorem is concerned can also be seen from table [ tab1 ] where present experimental branching ratios and asymmetries of wrhds are gathered together with the predictions of two typical approaches to wrhds .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .asymmetries and branching ratios of four most important wrhds : hs -hara s theorem satisfied , ref.@xcite ; hv -hara s theorem violated , ref.@xcite [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     from the comparison of the prediction of the static quark model with the results of the pcac calculation ( also given in table [ tabnlhd ] ) , we see that the relative sign of contributions from diagrams ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) has to be positive .",
    "indeed , on account of @xmath5 symmetry of weak hamiltonian we have @xmath6 and a negative sign between contributions ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) would lead to contradiction with the pcac description of p.v . nlhd amplitudes .",
    "this is also seen when @xmath7 is a _",
    "u_-spin singlet @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "please note that the formulas obtained by pcac reduction do _ not _ depend on any intermediate states .",
    "thus , for nlhds the relative positive sign between the two contributions has been confirmed for @xmath9 in a way that _ completely avoids using any intermediate states_. since within the calculational scheme employed , the difference between nlhds and wrhds consists solely in the replacement of the quark pseudoscalar current by the vector one , the relative contributions from diagrams ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) in the p.v .",
    "wrhd amplitudes ( table 2 ) must be added . in other words ,",
    "consistency with formulas obtained by pcac reduction of nlhd amplitudes in the @xmath10 limit requires that in this limit the contributions from diagrams ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) have to be added for the @xmath1 p.v .",
    "amplitude as well ( as in eq.([sigma ] ) ) : the @xmath11 limit is relevant for both current - algebra ( ca ) soft - pion estimates and for hara s theorem .",
    "it follows that consistency with the pcac - based description of nlhds requires in particular that the @xmath2 asymmetry be positive , in disagreement with ref .",
    "@xcite and chiral approaches @xcite .    at this point",
    "it is appropriate to discuss the connection between the framework considered in this paper so far and the standard ca prescription supplemented with su(3)-breaking resonance - induced corrections .",
    "namely , the p.v .",
    "nlhd amplitudes @xmath12 are usually described in terms of the contribution from the ca commutator plus terms proportional to pion momentum @xmath13 : @xmath14|b_i\\rangle+ k_{\\mu}m^{\\mu } \\ ] ] the second term on the right vanishes in the su(3 ) limit @xmath9 .",
    "this term is thought to be dominated by the su(3)-breaking corrections from the intermediate @xmath15 resonances @xcite .",
    "using the properties of the cabibbo hamiltonian to replace @xmath16 $ ] with @xmath17 $ ] , and evaluating the contribution from resonances , one obtains : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denote baryon states , of which one is obtained from @xmath20 by the action of isospin generator @xmath21 and the other is left unchanged .",
    "the leading term ( in su(3 ) breaking ) in eq.([reduced ] ) is @xmath22 .",
    "it contains the @xmath23-exchange - induced term @xmath24 .",
    "it must correspond to the @xmath25 term obtained in the scheme of this paper at @xmath26 : one might have assumed that the states @xmath27 in between which the ca commutator is to be evaluated are the states of the static quark model .",
    "alternatively , one might _ saturate _ the ca commutator with this part of contribution from resonances which does _ not _ vanish in the su(3 ) limit .",
    "that is , one may replace the r.h.s of eq.([caplussu3break ] ) with the pole model prescription .",
    "this amounts to considering energy denominators for the intermediate states in the amplitudes of diagrams ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) . when one restricts to the @xmath15 ( @xmath28 ) resonances in intermediate states , for @xmath29 transitions these energy denominators are @xmath30 for diagram ( b1 ) , and @xmath31 for diagram ( b2 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath32 we see that @xmath33 enters with opposite signs into the two denominators .",
    "thus su(3 ) corrections to diagrams ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) are of opposite signs : @xmath34 as a result , the symmetry structure of the su(3)-breaking correction in eq .",
    "( [ reduced ] ) is different from the su(3)-preserving ca term ( @xmath35 versus @xmath25 ) .",
    "please compare the form of the right - hand sides of eqs.([reduced ] ) and ( [ b1minusb2 ] ) .    in the approach to wrhds discussed in @xcite and in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) ,",
    "only the wrhd counterpart of the @xmath35 term above is considered . in that approach",
    "there is no counterpart to the ca commutator term of nlhds : the @xmath25 term in wrhds is set to zero by hand because it is thought to violate gauge invariance .",
    "on the other hand , the gauge - invariant scheme of this paper indicates that such a term ( generated by the replacement of current @xmath36 for nlhds with current @xmath37 for wrhds ) exists and has symmetry properties corresponding to the sums of @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( table 2).therein lies the difference between the genuine quark model approach and the standard approach of ref .",
    "@xcite or more recent chpt attempts .    with nonzero @xmath40",
    "it follows that hara s theorem must be violated , unless a good reason for rejecting the wrhd counterpart to the ca commutator is given .",
    "one can not claim that this counterpart to the ca commutator violates gauge invariance : the input into the calculation is gauge - invariant direct photon - quark coupling and all the steps in the calculation are correct .",
    "the ( nonzero ) @xmath25 term must be present in nlhds because it corresponds to nonzero value of @xmath41 in the quark model in the su(3 ) limit .",
    "this is in agreement with the present descriptions of nlhds , in which the contribution from the commutator is nonzero and large .",
    "subtracting the @xmath25 term in wrhds while keeping it in nlhds is completely arbitrary .",
    "thus , the @xmath25 term should be present in both nlhds ( the ca commutator ) and wrhds ( the counterpart to the ca commutator ) .    as the p.v .",
    "@xmath2 amplitude is due to amplitude @xmath39 only ( table 2 ) , a negative sign of the @xmath2 experimental asymmetry would mean that amplitudes @xmath39 must enter with an additional negative sign , thus signalling the @xmath35 structure , and the cancellation of @xmath38 and @xmath39 terms for @xmath1 .",
    "however , what is more important , a large negative @xmath2 asymmetry would also mean that either something is badly wrong with the quark - model machinery which connects the calculations for quark pseudoscalar and vector currents ( i reject this possibility because it concerns _ spin _ properties of the quark model ) , or a completely new contribution reveals itself in wrhds _ only _ , not only cancelling the counterpart to the ca commutator , but effectively reversing its sign .",
    "there is no hint of what such a contribution could be .    as mentioned in section 2 , calculations of the p.v .",
    "amplitudes proceed in two steps : ( 1 ) evaluation of the admixture of @xmath42 pairs in @xmath43 baryons , and ( 2 ) calculation of the matrix elements of currents @xmath36 and @xmath44 in between states with these admixtures . as the latter",
    "do not depend on the current , there is no reason why the scheme should fail for the vector current while being correct for the pseudoscalar one .",
    "thus , if the ca commutator is dominant in nlhds ( the @xmath9 term dominates ) , positive @xmath2 asymmetry is a _",
    "must_. consequently , negative @xmath2 experimental asymmetry would signal deep trouble for the quark model .",
    "note also that the violation of hara s theorem must be related to step ( 1 ) above , ie . to the properties of states in the quark model (",
    "the interaction @xmath45 of step ( 2 ) is gauge invariant ) .",
    "as discussed , the static gauge - invariant quark - model calculation unavoidably violates hara s theorem .",
    "this is in direct conflict with what is easily proved in hadron - level approach .",
    "before we jump to the conclusion that there is something wrong with the static quark model , let us discuss the origin of our result from a different perspective .",
    "we start with the standard hadron - level picture . in this picture",
    "hadrons are assumed to be well described by an effective local field theory .",
    "we are interested in what happens at point @xmath46 .",
    "this point ( as any other point in momentum space ) corresponds to particles ( baryons , photons ) described by plane waves .",
    "the positions of corresponding particles are not well defined : the particles may be found anywhere . it might help to think of particles as `` potentially being everywhere '' .",
    "the static - limit calculations in the quark model involve juggling spin , flavour and parity ( quark - antiquark ) indices only ( see eqs.([creationa],[hpv],[perturb],[5qto3q ] ) , fig.1 ) : the quarks themselves are in states of vanishing but definite momenta .",
    "this prescription , when _ interpreted _ in position space , corresponds to the situation in which positions of quarks `` are '' arbitrary , ie .",
    "now it is _ individual _ quarks that `` are potentially everywhere '' .",
    "in particular , this includes configurations with baryon quarks `` potentially being '' arbitrarily far away from each other .",
    "such nonlocal quark configurations are forbidden in an effective hadron - level local field theory , when quarks are assumed to be close to one another .",
    "thus , the static quark model includes configurations which are not and can not be taken into account in the language of effective hadron - level local field theory .",
    "hadron- and quark- level prescriptions are generically _ different_. quark - model violation of hara s theorem must come from these nonlocal configurations .",
    "the nonlocal configurations of baryon quarks may be considered unacceptable : their presence is in conflict with the expectations based on the idea of confinement .",
    "we know , however , that in general composite quantum states may exhibit nonlocal features .",
    "since baryons are quantum states made out of quarks , the real question is whether we can exclude such ( admittedly weird ) configurations on the grounds of either experiment or of general ideas of quantum physics ( as opposed to those based on certain theoretical expectations ) ?",
    "consider therefore the situation from the point of view of what is measurable .",
    "the closer we approach the @xmath47 limit ( assuming we can manipulate @xmath48 ) , the worse spatial resolution we have .",
    "consequently , we can not experimentally exclude that in the @xmath49 limit , quarks may be thought of as `` being '' arbitrarily far away from each other , ie .",
    "that the photon - baryon coupling is intrinsically nonlocal . note that if experiment is set up to measure momenta it is not meaningful to talk about hadron position in any other way than with the help of a theory",
    "the same applies to the positions of quarks . in order to see small distances and check what quark positions `` really are ''",
    ", one has to look `` deep into hadrons '' .",
    "this requires high , not low momenta and amounts to asking a completely different experimental question .",
    "consequently , it is hard to see how one can reject the violation of hara s theorem on the grounds of general principles .",
    "this interpretation of quark - model results is clearly more general than the model considered : the composite quark state may couple to zero - energy photon in a genuinely nonlocal way .",
    "note that the interpretation in terms of quarks `` being '' arbitrarily far away naturally follows also when baryon magnetic moments are calculated in the original quark model ( cf eq.([mm ] ) ) .",
    "a possible resolution to this problem of free quarks , corresponding to the _ expected _ effective local theory at hadron level , was proposed a long time ago in the form of the confinement idea . when confinement is imposed in a way consistent with the standard expectations ,",
    "no clear - cut conflict between naive quark model calculations and hadron - level expectations emerges for baryon magnetic moments . for wrhds , however , the predictions of the static quark model , and those of the hadron - level effective local theory , are different .",
    "thus , it appears that wrhds probe in a subtle way the original question of apparent quark freedom and unobservability at low energies . for this reason",
    ", i think that the issue of the violation of hara s theorem is extremely interesting and very important .",
    "there is another way to see that the violation of hara s theorem requires some kind of nonlocality .",
    "namely , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that when the violation of hara s theorem with built - in current conservation is _ forced _ into the `` corset '' of effective hadron - level local description , the electromagnetic axial baryonic current can not be strongly suppressed at infinity : the fall - off must be as slow as @xmath50 .",
    "this should be contrasted with models in which the assumed exponential suppression of the current leads to hara s theorem . since there is no massless hadron ,",
    "the nonlocality discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite should be thought of as simulating some other kind of nonlocality .",
    "one may argue that the static calculation is inadequate and that small components of dirac spinors should be taken into account .",
    "indeed , small components necessarily emerge when quarks are confined to a restricted volume of space .",
    "one may hope that contributions from these components could cancel the static limit term , thus restoring hara s theorem",
    ". this may be so ( see , however , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the real problem is that one should include such terms in other calculations as well .",
    "in particular , they should be taken into account in the calculations of p.v .",
    "meson - baryon couplings .",
    "the relevant calculations ( equivalent to those of section 2 ) were performed by ddh @xcite in the nonrelativistic ( actually static ) limit .",
    "thus , the celebrated ddh results stem from an approach that violates standard ideas about confinement .    as the photon and vector - meson p.v .",
    "couplings to baryons are calculated using the same quark - level current , the dirac structures of photon and vector - meson couplings at hadron level should be identical .",
    "the only gauge - invariant coupling acceptable in local hadron - level framework is that involving @xmath51 ( with @xmath20 being baryon bispinors ) . if hara s theorem is satisfied ,",
    "also for vector mesons this structure only should appear .",
    "however , the interaction @xmath52 is inconsistent with the data on p.v .",
    "effects in @xmath53 interactions ( see section 6 ) .",
    "the above arguments suggest that the language of effective local theories at hadron level might sometimes constitute an insufficient approximation to reality . in other words , the assumption that spin-1/2 baryon may _ always _ be well approximated by a dirac spinor field depending on a well - defined single point @xmath54 might be too strong .",
    "although one could speculate about possible deeper origins and implications of the suspected limitations of the standard language , such speculations will be warranted only if large positive value of the @xmath2 experimental asymmetry is established .",
    "of course , any limitation of the standard hadron - level language does not mean that the quark - level theory can not be local or that individual quarks have to exhibit intrinsic nonlocality .",
    "the calculation of this paper constitutes an explicit counterexample . point - like interactions of the standard model underly the whole picture herein considered",
    "it is the question of proper description of baryons as composite states that is being discussed here .",
    "clearly , an effective local field theory at hadron level should constitute a sufficient approximation for most of the present practical purposes .",
    "so far , the ( mutually proportional ) amplitudes @xmath40 and @xmath55 have been nonzero constants . as the calculation was performed in the su(3 ) limit , these constants were independent of the su(3 ) breaking parameter @xmath48 .",
    "this was also the case in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath56 p.v .",
    "amplitudes extracted from nlhds ( and in particular , their scale ) were used to the description of @xmath57 nuclear p.v .",
    "processes and their scale .",
    "let us assume that experiment confirms the pattern corresponding to the sum of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , thus indicating spin symmetry between nlhds and wrhds at @xmath58 .",
    "this does not mean yet that the preceding sections describe the physical situation in a qualitatively correct way .",
    "the static quark model gives predictions at @xmath59 , while in the real world @xmath60 .",
    "still , one suspects that spin symmetry would survive should the masses of @xmath61 and @xmath62 quarks be different .",
    "thus , in a theoretical description in which quark masses are free parameters , let @xmath63 be a function of @xmath64 ( ie .",
    "@xmath65 ) , which can be expanded into a series in the vicinity of @xmath66 ( thus , the form @xmath67 is not allowed ) .",
    "hara s theorem is satisfied if @xmath68 . from symmetry properties under @xmath69 interchange ( table [ tabnlhd ] ) we see that only nonzero even powers of @xmath48 may appear in the expansion of @xmath70 and @xmath71 . with @xmath72 , the lowest order term is proportional to @xmath73 . if @xmath74 , the relevant hadron - level structure of photon - hadron p.v .",
    "interaction may be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes amplitude for diagram ( b1)(diagram ( b2 ) ) with the @xmath73 factor removed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a pole model leading to the above solution was discussed .",
    "clearly , this way of making positive @xmath2 asymmetry consistent with hara s theorem is in conflict with the nonzero value of the ca commutator and with the quark model results for @xmath77 , according to which the contribution of @xmath23-exchange between quarks does _ not _ vanish for @xmath78 .",
    "internal consistency requires that for @xmath78 both @xmath79 and @xmath23-exchange contributions to @xmath80 ( eq.([sigma ] ) ) behave in the same way in the static limit : they are either both zero or both nonzero .    note that if hara s theorem is to be satisfied in the su(3 ) limit for positive @xmath2 asymmetry , _ all _ p.v .",
    "amplitudes must vanish in this limit ( eq.([harab1plusb2 ] ) ) .",
    "this is not the resolution proposed in @xcite and chiral approaches @xcite , where only the @xmath81 p.v .",
    "amplitude vanishes , while the p.v .",
    "amplitudes of the remaining three wrhds stay nonzero .",
    "the symmetry structure of the latter approach yields the pattern @xmath82 for the asymmetries of @xmath83 , and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "such symmetry structure might be obtained in the static limit with direct photon - quark coupling if the photon were to couple to quarks through the nonminimal coupling of eqs.([nonminimal1],[nonminimal2 ] ) .",
    "this is not acceptable .",
    "extracting information on @xmath85 for small @xmath86 from the analysis of nlhds and wrhds is impossible : with @xmath87 fixed , there is no way to check whether the transition amplitudes are proportional to @xmath73 or not . despite that",
    ", it is still possible to get some experimental indication as to which of the two theoretical solutions : @xmath88 or @xmath89 , is favored . in order to see what these indications are , we recall that the coupling of photon to baryon results from @xmath90 coupling to quark vector current . as discussed in section 2 , the coupling of _ u_-spin - singlet vector meson to baryons results from its coupling to the _ same _ current . since the whole quark model machinery does not depend on the nature of the field this current is coupled to , we conclude that one should be able to get some hints about the possible dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath48 by looking at the @xmath57 p.v",
    ". couplings of vector mesons to nucleons .",
    "if the factor of @xmath91 is present in @xmath55 and @xmath40 , it follows that _ all _ @xmath57 p.v .",
    "weak couplings of mesons to baryons should be very small .",
    "thus , we should observe nearly vanishing p.v .",
    "effects in the interactions of nucleons . with respect to nlhd - based su(3 )",
    "estimates , they should be down by a factor of the order of at least @xmath92 or less depending on the process and the precise mass values used .",
    "this is not what is experimentally observed . the present data on p.v .",
    "nuclear forces indicate that the p.v .",
    "couplings of mesons to nucleons are roughly of the order expected from nlhds by an su(3)-symmetric extrapolation , ie . as if there was no @xmath91 suppression .",
    "this is in particular supported by p.v .",
    "effects observed in @xmath93 scattering , which constitute the best experimentally established effect @xcite .",
    "these data require the presence of a @xmath94 term , and in particular , nonvanishing contributions from @xmath55 diagrams . if these @xmath55 ( and the so - called @xmath95 , cf .",
    "@xcite ) diagrams were negligible and only the factorisation @xmath96 terms ( see @xcite ) were allowed , one could not describe the p.v . effect observed in @xmath93 scattering @xcite .",
    "a @xmath97 term can not describe the data @xcite either .",
    "this suggests that the coupling of photons need not vanish , unless some additional cancellation takes place .",
    "this reasoning is correct , provided p.v .",
    "couplings of vector mesons to baryons can be correctly described by their evaluation in the static limit of the quark model .",
    "this is how they were estimated in @xcite , where they were also linked through symmetry to the soft - pion contribution to p.v .",
    "nlhd amplitudes .",
    "it may be that the effects observed in nuclear parity violation mean that the @xmath98 p.v .",
    "couplings of vector mesons to baryons can not be reliably estimated in this way .",
    "for example it may be argued that in the p.v .",

    "nuclear forces may be considered as a hint only . in the meantime , in order to learn more about wrhds we have to wait for the results of the ktev and na48 experiments on @xmath2 decays @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have analysed the assumptions needed to generate the formulas of the vmd approach to wrhds @xcite .",
    "we have shown that all their characteristic features are obtained also in an explicitly gauge - invariant quark - level scheme in the limit of static quarks with direct photon - quark coupling . consequently , the claim of ref .",
    "@xcite that the results of the vmd @xmath101 @xmath102 scheme of refs .",
    "@xcite ( and the violation of hara s theorem ) follow from a lack of gauge invariance , is incorrect .",
    "our analysis shows that the standard pole - model approach of @xcite and chpt miss a quark - level contribution , which we call the wrhd counterpart to the ca commutator in nlhds ( the lowest - order term in chpt ) .",
    "this contribution is obtained by replacing the interaction of pseudoscalar meson with the quark pseudoscalar current by the interaction of photon with the quark vector current , ie . through the use of _ spin properties of the quark model_.",
    "the obtained term is gauge invariant and proportional to matrix elements of the ca commutator in nlhds .",
    "consequently , the vanishing of the latter matrix elements in between two states of strangeness differing by @xmath103 should hold in the @xmath104 limit if hara s theorem is to be satisfied . because these matrix elements are proportional to the elements of the p.c .",
    "weak hamiltonian in between similar two baryonic states , the latter matrix elements should also vanish in this limit .",

    "large positive @xmath2 asymmetry is necessarily predicted .",
    "any other experimental value for this asymmetry constitutes _ a serious problem for the quark model_.    negative @xmath2 asymmetry of the ( consistent with hara s theorem ) standard pole model @xcite and chpt , can not be obtained in calculations performed with static quarks .",
    "such calculations , when applied to nlhds , agree with the expectations based on the dominance of ca commutator . if experiments find negative @xmath2 asymmetry , the discrepancy with this paper can not be blamed on the violation of gauge invariance , and would constitute a serious problem _ for the quark model_. a close - to - zero experimental value for this asymmetry would constitute another problem .",
    "positive @xmath2 asymmetry does not mean yet that hara s theorem must be violated , but that this is likely .",
    "if hara s theorem is satisfied , _ all _ wrhd amplitudes must vanish in the su(3 ) limit .",
    "although we can not vary @xmath48 , getting experimental information on the @xmath48 dependence of theoretical amplitudes is to some extent possible .",
    "the experiments in question deal with the sector of weak p.v . @xmath57 nuclear transitions and indicate a lack of the su(3 ) suppression for p.v .",
    "weak couplings of vector mesons to baryons .",
    "this hints that there is no such suppression for photons either , unless some additional cancellations occur .",
    "we have argued that although the violation of hara s theorem is in conflict with standard theoretical anstze at hadron level , it does not have to be unphysical .",
    "an interpretation of the quark - model result in terms of an intrinsic baryon nonlocality was presented .",
    "it was stressed that the issue of hara s theorem probes the original quark - model question of apparent quark freedom and additivity at low energy .",
    "it may be that the quark model is an abstraction that went too far in assigning particle - like properties to quarks , thus leading us into conflict with the hadron - level description .",
    "however , it may also be that quark model results should be treated seriously .",
    "measurement of the @xmath2 asymmetry will provide crucial information , pointing out either to _ a serious problem for the quark model _ or to _ intrinsic nonlocality of baryons _ when these are probed by low energy photons .",
    "whatever the resolution , wrhds should teach us a lot about the quark model in the low - energy domain , ie . about the way quarks combine to form hadrons .",

    "<S> it is proved that symmetry structure of the parity - violating amplitudes of weak radiative hyperon decays in the vector - meson dominance ( vmd ) approach , and the violation of hara s theorem in particular , are also obtained when direct coupling @xmath0 of photon to quarks is used in place of vmd ( with calculations performed in the limit of static quarks ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , violation of hara s theorem in vmd - based models does not result from the lack of gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> it is further shown that , in the static limit of the quark model , the current - algebra commutator term in the parity - violating amplitudes of nonleptonic hyperon decays and the parity - violating @xmath1 decay amplitude are proportional to each other . as a result , hara s theorem may be satisfied in this limit if and only if the contribution from the current - algebra commutator in nonleptonic hyperon decays is zero . violation of hara s theorem is traced back to the nonlocality of quark model states in the static limit . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that the ensuing intrinsic baryon nonlocality does not have to be unphysical . </S>",
    "<S> it is stressed that the measurement of the @xmath2 asymmetry will provide very important information concerning the presence or absence of nonlocal features in parity - violating photon coupling to baryons at vanishing photon momentum . if the @xmath2 asymmetry is found negative </S>",
    "<S> , hara s theorem is satisfied but the gauge - invariant quark model machinery predicting its violation must miss some contribution , or be modified . </S>",
    "<S> if experiment confirms positive @xmath2 asymmetry , then , most likely , hara s theorem is violated . </S>",
    "<S> although positive @xmath2 asymmetry admits of the possibility that hara s theorem is satisfied , this alternative is in disagreement with hints suggested by the similarity of photon and vector - meson couplings and the observed size of parity - violating nuclear forces .    </S>",
