    "low- and medium - energy antiproton experiments have fruitfully addressed a variety of topics over many years , starting at lear and continuing with the fermilab antiproton source and cern ad .",
    "techniques and energies used in these experiments have ranged from antiproton annihilation at rest up to 8gev , as well as experiments using trapped antiprotons .",
    "physics issues have included the search for glueballs and hybrid mesons , precision studies of hyperon decay and charmonium spectroscopy , and tests of _ cp _ and _ cpt _ symmetry .",
    "starting in about 2015 , the fair project  @xcite at gsi - darmstadt will add to this list studies of strange matter , charm , and nuclei far from stability  @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab - sens - comp ] compares available antiproton intensities at cern , fermilab , and fair .",
    "because the fermilab antiproton source uses 120gev protons on target and accumulates at 8gev , it has a significant rate advantage with respect to fair .",
    "it also can potentially operate full - time , while at fair , the panda antiproton experiment  @xcite will have to share time with other modes of operation at fair .",
    "this intensity advantage could be maximized by building a new , small storage ring at fermilab , in which fixed - target collisions would then take place , to allow the accumulator to stack antiprotons full - time ; in this way a @xmath1 luminosity of @xmath2@xmath3s@xmath4 could be supported .",
    "but even without an accelerator upgrade , operation at @xmath5@xmath3s@xmath4 would be possible with 50% duty factor , and @xmath6@xmath3s@xmath4 could be achieved with 85% duty factor , and an upgrade of the fermilab e835 detector .    .antiproton",
    "intensities at existing and future facilities [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "by adding a small magnet , tracking and vertex detectors , and tof counters to the e835 calorimeter , plus modern , high - bandwidth triggering and data - acquisition systems , several important topics can be studied .      after a more than 20-year search ,",
    "@xmath0@xmath8 mixing is now established at 9.2 standard deviations  @xcite , thanks mainly to the @xmath9 factories .",
    "the level of mixing is consistent with the wide range of standard model predictions  @xcite ; however , this does not preclude a significant and potentially detectable contribution from new physics . since some new - physics models predict different effects in the charge-2/3 (  up - type \" )",
    "quark sector than in the down - type , it is important to carry out such studies of charm mesons  the only up - type system for which meson mixing can occur .    the @xmath1 annihilation cross section to open charm is expected to be substantial ; for example , a recent estimate gives @xmath10b at @xmath11gev  @xcite . at @xmath12@xmath3s@xmath4 ,",
    "this represents some @xmath13 events per year , substantially exceeding each year the integrated sample ( @xmath14 events ) available at the @xmath9 factories . since there will also be @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 events",
    ", the total charm sample will be even larger ; with the use of a target nucleus heavier than hydrogen , the charm - production @xmath18-dependence  @xcite could further enhance statistics .",
    "such a target could also localize primary interactions to an @xmath19m)-sized region , allowing the @xmath20-meson decay distance to be cleanly determined .",
    "medium - energy ( @xmath21gev/@xmath22 ) @xmath23 annihilation may thus be the optimal way to study charm mixing and search for possible new - physics contributions via the clean signature  @xcite of charm _",
    "cp _ violation ( cpv ) .",
    "the fermilab hypercp experiment  @xcite amassed the world s largest samples of hyperon decays , including @xmath24 reconstructed @xmath25 decays and @xmath26 produced @xmath27 .",
    "hypercp observed unexpected signals at the @xmath282@xmath29 level for possible new physics in the rare hyperon decay @xmath30  @xcite and the @xmath31 _ cp _ asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath32 threshold lies in the same region as the open - charm threshold , the proposed experiment can further test these observations using @xmath33 decay and potential @xmath34 cpv  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dedicated @xmath35 storage ring of table  [ tab - sens - comp ] could decelerate antiprotons to the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 thresholds , where an experiment at @xmath39 luminosity could amass the clean , @xmath40-event samples needed to confront the hypercp signals directly .      using the fermilab antiproton source ,",
    "experiments e760 and e835 made the world s most precise measurements of charmonium masses and widths  @xcite .",
    "this precision ( @xmath41100kev ) was enabled by the small energy spread of the stochastically cooled antiproton beam and the absence of fermi motion and negligible energy loss in the h@xmath42 cluster - jet target .",
    "the other key advantage of @xmath43 annihilation is its ability to produce charmonium states of all quantum numbers , in contrast to @xmath44 machines , which produce primarily @xmath45 states ( and , to a lesser degree , states accessible in @xmath9 decay or in @xmath46 production ) .",
    "although charmonium has by now been extensively studied , a number of questions remain , including the nature of the mysterious @xmath47 state and improved measurement of @xmath48 and @xmath49 parameters .",
    "the study of antihydrogen atoms in flight may be a way around some of the difficulties encountered in the cern trapping experiments .",
    "first steps in this direction were taken by fermilab e862 , which observed formation of antihydrogen in flight during 19967  @xcite .",
    "methods to measure the antihydrogen lamb shift and fine structure ( the @xmath50@xmath51 and @xmath51@xmath52 energy differences ) were subsequently worked out  @xcite .",
    "progress toward this goal may be compatible with normal tevatron collider operations  a possibility currently under investigation .",
    "if the feasibility of the approach is borne out by further work , the program could continue into the post - tevatron era .      while general relativity predicts that the gravitational forces on matter and antimatter should be identical",
    ", no direct experimental test of this prediction has yet been made  @xcite .",
    "attempts at a quantized theory of gravity generally introduce non - tensor forces , which could cancel for matter - matter and antimatter - antimatter interactions but add for matter - antimatter ones .",
    "in addition , possible  fifth forces \" or non-@xmath53 dependence have been discussed .",
    "such effects can be sensitively sought by measuring the gravitational acceleration of antimatter in the field of the earth . while various such experiments have been discussed for many years , one  measurement of the gravitational acceleration of antihydrogen ",
    "has only recently become feasible and is now proposed both at cern and at fermilab  @xcite .",
    "the principle of the antimatter gravity experiment ( age ) is to form a beam of slow ( @xmath54km / s ) antihydrogen in a penning trap and pass the beam through a @xmath55-m - long mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "the phase of the interference pattern can be measured to a small fraction of the ( @xmath56 m ) grating period , and measurement of the phase vs.  the speed of the atom determines @xmath57 .",
    "simulation shows that @xmath57 can be measured to 1% of @xmath58 with one - million antihydrogen ( @xmath59 ) atoms incident on the interferometer ; this can be done parasitically during the tevatron run .",
    "the proposed age goal is a @xmath60 measurement , requiring @xmath26 @xmath59 atoms .",
    "given the expected @xmath61 antiproton - trapping and @xmath59-formation efficiency , this can be accomplished at the antiproton source in a few - month dedicated run .",
    "with the end of the tevatron collider program in sight , new and unique measurements are possible at the fermilab antiproton source  @xcite .",
    "such a program can substantially broaden the clientele and appeal of us particle physics ."
