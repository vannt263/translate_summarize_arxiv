    "phase space quasidistribution functions are a convenient way of characterizing the quantum state of optical radiation [ [ cahiglaupr69 ] ] . over past several years",
    ", they have gained experimental significance due to the reconstruction of the wigner function of a single light mode performed using tomographic algorithms [ [ smitbeckprl93 ] ] .",
    "recently , an alternative method for measuring quasidistribution functions of a light mode has been proposed [ [ wallvogepra96],[banawodkprl96 ] ] .",
    "the method is based on photon counting of the signal field superposed on a probe field in a coherent state .",
    "the advantage of this method is that there is no complicated numerical processing of the experimental data .",
    "a simple arithmetic operation performed on the photocount statistics yields directly the value of a quasidistribution function at a point defined by the amplitude and the phase of the coherent field .",
    "the purpose of this communication is to study the application of squeezed states in the proposed photon counting scheme .",
    "the most important feature of squeezed states is that quantum fluctuations in some observables are reduced below the coherent state level [ [ loudknigjmo87 ] ] . in the context of optical homodyne tomography ,",
    "the squeezing transformation has been shown to be capable of compensating for the deleterious effect of low detection efficiency [ [ leonpaulprl94 ] ] .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to discuss the information on the quantum state of light which can be retrieved in a photon counting experiment using squeezed states .",
    "we start with a brief description of the proposed setup , depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "the field incident on a photodetector is a combination , performed using a beam splitter with a power transmission @xmath0 , of a transmitted signal mode and a reflected probe mode .",
    "the statistics of the detector counts @xmath1 is used to calculate an alternating series @xmath2 . in terms of the outgoing mode ,",
    "this series is given by the expectation value of the parity operator : @xmath3 where the annihilation operator of the outgoing mode @xmath4 is a linear combination of the signal and the probe field operators : @xmath5    the expectation value of the measured observable involves statistical properties of both the signal and the probe modes .",
    "the operator @xmath6 can be written in the following normally ordered form : @xmath7:,\\ ] ] which has a clear and intuitive interpretation within the wigner function formalism : the measured quantity is proportional to the phase space integral of the product of the signal and the probe wigner functions with relatively rescaled parameterizations [ [ banawodkprl96 ] ] .",
    "hence the proposed scheme is a realization of direct sampling of the quantum phase space .",
    "an important class of probe fields are coherent states @xmath8 ) .",
    "thus the measured observable is given by the following operator acting in the hilbert space of the signal mode : @xmath9:.\\ ] ] this observable is closely related to a certain quasidistribution function .",
    "the most straightforward way to identify this link is to recall that an @xmath10-ordered quasidistribution function at a complex phase space point @xmath11 is given by the expectation value of the normally ordered operator : @xmath12:.\\ ] ] after a simple rearrangement of parameters we finally arrive at the formula : @xmath13 thus , the alternating series computed from the photocount statistics yields the value of a quasidistribution function at a point @xmath14 defined by the amplitude and the phase of the probe coherent field .",
    "the complete quasidistribution function can be scanned point  by ",
    "point by changing the probe field parameters .",
    "the ordering of the measured quasidistribution function depends on the beam splitter transmission .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that a fraction of the signal field escapes through the second unused output port of the beam splitter .",
    "these losses of the field lower the ordering of the detected observable .",
    "this effect is analogous to the one appearing in balanced homodyne detection with imperfect detectors [ [ leonpaulpra93],[banawodkpra97 ] ] . in the limit @xmath15 ,",
    "when the complete signal field is detected , we measure directly the wigner function , corresponding to the symmetric ordering .    fig .  1 . the setup for direct probing of the quantum phase space .",
    "the detector measures the photocount statistics @xmath1 of a signal @xmath16 combined with a probe field @xmath17 using a beam splitter with a power transmission  @xmath0 .",
    "we will now consider the case when a squeezed coherent state @xmath18th mode : @xmath19.\\ ] ] the detected quantity is now given by the expectation value of the following operator acting in the hilbert space of the signal mode : @xmath20    in order to find an interpretation for this observable , we will derive a formula for the squeezing transformations of the parity operator @xmath6 .",
    "we start from a simple unitary transformation : @xmath21 this equation implies the commutator : @xmath22 = 0,\\ ] ] which states that generation or annihilation of pairs of photons conserves parity .",
    "therefore , the parity operator is invariant under the squeezing transformation : @xmath23 this identity has nontrivial consequences when written in terms of the signal and the probe modes .",
    "it is equivalent to the equation : @xmath24 which , after moving the signal squeezing operators to the right hand side , yields the following result : @xmath25 this formula shows that squeezing of the probe mode is equivalent to squeezing of the signal mode with the opposite sign of the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "this change of the sign swaps the field quadratures that get squeezed or antisqueezed under the squeezing transformation .",
    "finally we obtain the following explicit expression for the detected signal field observable : @xmath27 thus , the setup delivers again an @xmath28-ordered quasidistribution function at a phase space point @xmath29 , but corresponding to a _ squeezed _ signal field .",
    "let us note that it was possible to carry the squeezing transformation from the probe to the signal degree of freedom only due to a specific form of the measured observable .",
    "we have explicitly used the conservation of the parity operator during generation or annihilation of pairs of photons . for a general observable defined for the outgoing mode @xmath4",
    ", there is no formula analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : przeniesienie ] ) .",
    "as an illustration , we will consider a photon counting experiment for a schrdinger cat state , which is a quantum superposition of two coherent states [ [ schlpernpra91 ] ] : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a real parameter .",
    "the wigner function of such a state contains , in addition to two positive peaks corresponding to the coherent states , an oscillating term originating from quantum interference between the classical  like components .",
    "this nonclassical feature is extremely fragile , and disappears very quickly in the presence of dissipation [ [ buzeknigpio95 ] ] .    as we have found in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exppisq ] ) , the outcome of the photon counting experiment with a squeezed probe field is related to an @xmath10-ordered quasidistribution of the squeezed schrdinger cat state @xmath32 . for simplicity",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the case @xmath33 . a simple but lengthy calculation yields the explicit formula for the phase space quasidistribution at a complex point @xmath34 : @xmath35\\sqrt{1 - 2s\\cosh 2r + s^2 } } \\left\\ {   \\exp\\left[-\\frac{2(p - e^{-r}\\kappa)^2}{e^{-2r}-s}\\right ] \\right .",

    "for comparison , we show two cases : when the schrdigner cat state is probed with coherent states @xmath38 and squeezed coherent states @xmath39 .",
    "the beam splitter transmission is @xmath40 .",
    "when coherent states are used , only a faint trace of the oscillatory pattern can be noticed due to losses of the signal field .",
    "in contrast , probing of the schrdinger cat state with suitably chosen squeezed states yields a clear picture of quantum coherence between distinct phase space components .",
    "this effect is particularly surprising if we realize that @xmath41 of the signal field power is lost through the unused output port of the beam splitter .",
    "the visibility of the oscillatory pattern depends substantially on the sign of the squeezing parameter @xmath26 .",
    "this can be most easily understood using the wigner phase space description of the discussed scheme [ [ banawodkprl96 ] ] . in order to detect the interference , fluctuations in the probe squeezed states have to be reduced in the direction corresponding to the rapid oscillations of the wigner function corresponding to the schrdinger cat state .",
    "the width of the rescaled probe wigner function along the squeezed direction must be smaller than the spacing between the interference fringes .",
    "we have studied the quantum optical scheme for direct sampling of the quantum phase space using squeezed coherent states .",
