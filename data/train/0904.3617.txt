    "can be written as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the excitation probability of one collective spin in sw @xmath100 , @xmath101 denotes the the stokes field s@xmath25 with photon number @xmath63 and @xmath102 denotes the @xmath63-fold collective spin excitation in sw @xmath22 .",

    "the trapping magnetic field and repumping beams are then quickly switched off .",
    "after 0.5 ms , the bias magnetic field of about 3 g is switched on , whereas the cooler beams is switched off and two pumping beams are switched on for 0.5 ms to optically pump the atoms to the desired state @xmath71 . as the two pumping beams , one couples all the magnetic transitions of latexmath:[$|5s_{1/2},f=2\\rangle \\rightarrow    cooler light ; the other pump ( @xmath2-pump ) couples the @xmath2 transition @xmath128 , shining in from the side .",
    "then , within another 4 ms , experimental trials ( each consisting of pumping , write and read pulses ) are repeated with a controllable period depending on the desired retrieval time . in order to re - prepare the atoms to the desired state @xmath71 , we switch on the two pumping beams in each experimental trial before write and read process , @xmath129 pump for 1.2 @xmath130 and @xmath2-pump for 0.9 @xmath59s .",
    "to deterministically generate the second order noon state , in each experimental run , we keep shining the write pulses . following each write , the two pumping beams ( clean pulses ) are switched on to re - prepare the atoms to the initial state @xmath71 .",
    "a click of coincidence between detectors d@xmath117 and d@xmath118 in fig . 1 will stop the remaining write pulses and clean pulses and the noon state is induced in the sw interferometer . after the sw state is converted back to anti - stokes photons , another experimental run restarts .",

    "are measured , which can be described as @xmath148where the first term is the two photon coincidence from the second order excitation , the second term is noise coming from the coincidence between the excitation and the background , and the third term is the coincidence between background noise .",
    "the normalized data are the coincidence counts divided by the sweeps , and are fitted by using @xmath149where we neglect the coincidence from background noise for simplicity , @xmath138 is the lifetime of the spin wave obtained from the decay from correlation , @xmath36 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 are fitting parameters .",
    "note that , from the first order data , we know that the background noise is much smaller than the signal retrieved from the atom ensemble . thereby for the second order noon state , the background coincidence count can be safely neglected since it is the second order small term .",
    "this does not affect the conclusion of our paper , since the lack of super - sensitivity in our experiment is mainly caused by short coherence time of the sw ."
