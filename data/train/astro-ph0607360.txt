    "as an important intermediate stage of many astrophysical processes , the dynamics of magnetized disc systems are frequently invoked to model different phenomena on various spatial and temporal scales , such as spiral or barred - spiral galaxies , magnetized accretion discs surrounding supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) anchored at galactic centres , accreting environs involving binary stars and protoplanetary systems etc .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to study magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) processes in discs for both theoretical and applied purposes .",
    "the pioneer development of the classic density wave theory for large - scale perturbation structures in differentially rotating discs ( lin & shu 1964 , 1966 ) has opened up a physical scenario to understand the basic dynamics of spiral galaxies ( lin 1987 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ; bertin & lin 1996 ) . linear perturbation or nonlinear theories are widely used as powerful tools of analysis to explore the structure and stability of disc systems . in many processes ,",
    "initially small perturbations may lead to more violent consequences ( e.g. , gravitational collapse of a central core ) which are crucial for the dynamical evolution of astrophysical systems .",
    "in various contexts , mhd perturbation configurations are valuable indicators of transitions to instabilities and of further dynamical structure and evolution .    for simplicity and clarity , the scale - free disc system as",
    "an idealized model is a frequent target of theoretical investigation .",
    "the concept of a ` scale - free ' or a ` self - similar ' disc means all relevant physical quantities in the disc system vary as powers of cylindrical radius @xmath3 such that the disc system carries no characteristic length scale ( e.g. , the linear speed of disc rotation @xmath1 and the equilibrium disc surface mass density @xmath5 etc . with @xmath0 being a constant exponent ) . given possible situations",
    ", one may introduce ` boundary conditions ' to describe a modified scale - free disc by cutting a central hole in a disc ( e.g. , zang 1976 ; evans & read 1998a , b ) or by limiting the radial extent of a disc .",
    "observationally , many disc galaxies show more or less flat rotation curves , indicating the presence of massive dark matter halos according to the newtonian gravity theory .",
    "theoretically , discs with flat rotation curves ( i.e. , the azimuthal velocity @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) belong to a specific subclass of scale - free discs , referred to as singular isothermal discs ( sids ) . since the seminal analysis of mestel ( 1963 ) , the sid model has attracted considerable attention in various astrophysical contexts ( e.g. , zang 1976 ; toomre 1977 ; lemos , kalnajs & lynden - bell 1991 ; shu et al .",

    "disc rotation curves tend to be flat over extended radii , giving a strong evidence for the existence of massive dark matter halos ( e.g. , rubin et al .",
    "1982 ; kent 1986 , 1987 , 1988 ) .",
    "given the inferred dominant masses , we recognize that a dark matter halo plays extremely important roles in the dynamical evolution of a disc galaxy ( miller et al . 1970 ; ostriker & peebles 1973 ; hohl 1971 ; miller 1978 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) .    besides the normal mode perturbation analysis in scale - free discs ( e.g. , zang 1976 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ; fan & lou 1997 ; evans & read 1998a , b ; goodman & evans 1999 ; shu et al .",
    "2000 ) , the zero - frequency neutral perturbation modes or stationary perturbation configurations are emphasized as the marginal instability in scale - free discs ( e.g. , lemos et al .",
    "1991 ; syer & tremaine 1996 ; shu et al .",
    "2000 ; lou & shen 2003 ; shen & lou 2003 ; shen & lou 2004a ; shen et al .",
    "2005 ; lou & zou 2004 , 2006 ; lou & wu , 2005 ; lou & bai 2006 ) .",
    "axisymmetric instabilities are thought to set in through transitions across such neutral modes ( safronov 1960 ; toomre 1964 ; lynden - bell & ostriker 1967 ; lemos et al . 1991 ; shu et al .",
    "parallel to zero - frequency modes for axisymmetric disturbances , shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) tentatively proposed that logarithmic spiral modes of stationary perturbation configurations also signal onsets of non - axisymmetric instabilities ; the resulting criterion appears to be compatible with the criterion of goodman & evans ( 1999 ) for instabilities in their normal mode approach .",
    "recently , shen & lou ( 2004a ) extended the analysis of shu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in a gravitationally coupled composite scale - free disc system of gaseous and stellar discs using a two - fluid formalism . in solving nonlinear mhd equations , it is a challenge to achieve analytical results unless some simplified assumptions are introduced , such as the stationarity ( @xmath8 ) condition etc .",
    "most results are analytic in this paper and it is highly desirable that numerical simulations should be developed as touchstones for the analytical results and further venture into new regimes where analytical methods can not reach ( syer & tremaine 1996 ) .",

    "this simplification is powerful in analytical analysis in comparison with the usual awesome mhd equations describing the roles of magnetic field .",
    "lou & wu ( 2005 ) discussed the global mhd perturbation configurations in a composite sid system of coupled gas and stellar components with an isopedic ( vertical ) magnetic field .",
    "lou & zou ( 2004 , 2006 ) investigated the similar kind of composite mhd sid problems except that their magnetic field is coplanar rather than isopedic .",
    "lou & bai ( 2006 ) analyzed mhd perturbation structures in a composite system of two coupled scale - free discs with a coplanar magnetic field .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to couple an isopedic magnetic field with a single scale - free gas disc embedded in an axisymmetric dark matter halo potential and to construct physically allowed global stationary mhd perturbation configurations in such a disc as well as to investigate the instability of such a disc system .",
    "parallel to the hydrodynamic treatment of syer & tremaine ( 1996 ) , our analysis leads to further mhd extensions and generalizations . to be specific ,",
    "six components of forces are involved in the disc equilibrium of our analysis , namely , the radial centrifugal force , the thermal gas pressure force in the disc , the self - gravity of the disc , the holding - back gravity force of an axisymmetric dark matter halo and the tension and pressure forces resulting from an isopedic magnetic field within the disc plane . while highly idealized , the unique combination of these essential elements of a disc galaxy does provide a new perspective and has already shown some novel characteristics .",
    "for example , the introduction of an isopedic magnetic field geometry in a scale - free disc does bring several new and interesting features in reference to prior related disc model analyses ( syer & tremaine 1996 ; shu et al .",

    "the scale - free disc model is often picked up by theorists for its relative simplicity and is explored as a powerful vehicle for a global analytical analysis .",

    ". the proof can be found in lynden - bell & lemos ( 1999 ) .",
    "fluid equations provide a valid dynamical description for a gas disc component , while distribution function equations are more appropriate for a collisionless stellar disc component ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) . after an introduction of the velocity dispersion of the stellar disc component regarded as an effective ` sound speed ' ,",
    "fluid equations can be approximately applied to stellar disc component as well ( lin & shu 1964 , 1966 ; lin 1987 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ; bertin & lin 1996 ; lou & shen 2003 ; shen & lou 2004a ; lou & zou 2004 , 2006 ; lou & wu 2005 ; lou & bai 2006 ) .    in treating a razor - thin scale - free disc system , we adopt two - dimensional fluid equations .",

    "such a constraint is unnecessary .",

    "in other words , an enhanced background dark matter halo potential or a stronger isopedic magnetic field tend to squash instabilities both in small ( mhd ring fragmentation ) and large ( mhd jeans collapse ) spatial scales .",

    "in contrast , the mhd ring fragmentation region always exists . for example , a cold disc ( @xmath382 or @xmath383 ) will always subject to the ring fragmentation instability .",

    "we come to the conclusion that a massive background dark matter halo ( i.e. , a high @xmath153 ratio ) and a strong isopedic magnetic field ( i.e. , a small @xmath110 ) tend to make the magnetized gas disc more stable against axisymmetric mhd disturbances .",
    "using the standard linearization procedure for mhd perturbations in a rotating disc , we have in a more general manner constructed global stationary mhd perturbation configurations ( i.e. , small deviations from the axisymmetric background ) for both aligned and unaligned logarithmic spiral patterns in a razor - thin scale - free disc system embedded in an axisymmetric dark matter halo potential and with an isopedic magnetic field almost vertically threaded through the gas disc plane .",
    "the stability analysis of axisymmetric mhd perturbations is performed in a disc of flat rotation curve with @xmath7 ( i.e. , sid ) as an example of illustration .",
    "the most important and interesting contribution of our paper is that we integrate several essential aspects , such as isopedic magnetic field and dark matter halo , into the disc dynamics and adopt an analytic approach for the stability analysis .",
    "a generalized relationship is achieved and some interesting properties directly derived from the relationship have been revealed .    as global stationary mhd perturbation configurations may represent transitions between stabilities to instabilities and vice versa ( shu et al . 2000 ) , we can use the obtained global mhd perturbation configurations to explore initial conditions for possible instabilities and the dynamical evolution of a razor - thin scale - free disc system .",
    "thus , a more realistic magnetized disc system to model actual spiral galaxies may provide sensible physical information . since the systematic galactic observations by rubin et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and kent ( 1986 , 1987 , 1988 ) , the massive dark matter halo becomes an indispensable component for models of disc galaxies , which are referred to as a partial disc system ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ; syer & tremaine 1996 ; shu et al .",

    ". meanwhile , the ubiquitous presence of galactic magnetic fields requires a serious and systematic consideration of the magnetized gas disc in a typical disc spiral galaxy in order to trace the dynamic evolution in a more realistic manner . in our idealized mhd model , the more massive dark matter halo",
    "is presumed to be axisymmetric and compatible with the scale - free conditions , while the magnetic field is taken to be of an isopedic geometry .",
    "our mhd disc model does include several essential elements of disc galaxies and have already shown some interesting and intricate phenomena . in short , self - gravity and thermal pressure of a rotating scale - free disc , the axisymmetric gravitational potential of a dark matter halo and the isopedic magnetic field across the disc",

    ", we can no longer regard the isopedic magnetic field as a modification but must face an entirely new physical situation involving several interesting features in a strongly magnetized disc system .",
    "an interesting example is to derive the mhd wkbj relation in equation ( [ wkbj ] ) for the instability of axisymmetric disturbances ( @xmath84 ) . when @xmath126 , we always have @xmath374 , indicating the disc system being stable for axisymmetric mhd disturbances of all wavelengths .",
    "starting from the case of @xmath126 , we may extend the same idea to more generalized situations .",
    "as a system has a strong magnetic field attached to plasma or gas , the magnetic field would have torn the system apart in the absence of an external massive dark matter halo potential .",
    "two possible physical examples come into mind : the hot magnetized gas trapped in the centre of a galaxy cluster ( e.g. , makino 1997 ; dolag et al . 2001 ; hu & lou 2004 ) and the accretion disc around a smbh ( e.g. , kudoh et al . 1996 ; kaburaki 2000 ) where strong magnetic field may exist .",
    "the former can be perceived in reference to a quasi - spherical system in which a hot gas is mainly confined by the dark matter potential and the hot gas itself is strongly magnetized .",
    "our current model offers another possibility in that a more or less flat gas disc system in rotation can be primarily confined by a dark matter potential and the gas disc itself is isopedically magnetized with a considerable strength . by observing the existence of unusually strong magnetic field in a localized region , we may predict some ` unseen ' dark matter components of the system .",
    "for instance , if a source region has strong cyclotron or synchrotron emissions with much reduced optical emissions , the scenario outlined above may provide a possible explanation .",
    "fujita & kato ( 2005 ) proposed that weibel instability may be responsible for generating strong magnetic fields in galaxies and clusters of galaxies at redshift as high as @xmath396 ; in such a scenario , the magnetic field can play a crucial role in forming galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "our model results , especially those for a strong magnetic field ( i.e. , @xmath126 ) , offer several interesting clues for the dynamics of galaxy or galaxy cluster formation . with extensive observations for magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies",
    "( taylor et al . 2006 ) , a more sensible mhd model may be constructed and tested .",
    "the final point of interest involves the radial flux of angular momentum .",
    "if the radial flux of angular momentum is constant , only the central part will collapse and the outer portion of a disc is stable . if the radial flux of angular momentum increases with increasing @xmath3 , the disc mass at all radii will lose their angular momentum by interacting with stationary mhd density waves , and hence gradually spiral inward and drift towards the centre .",
    "in this situation , not only the central part , but also the entire disc drifts inward . for a single rotating disc embedded in an axisymmetric dark matter halo , the angular momentum of the disc system",
    "is conserved . in the presence of an external nonaxisymmetric potential , such as a companion or satellite galaxy , this conservation no longer holds .",
