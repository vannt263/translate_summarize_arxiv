    "the majority of low - mass stars emerge from their parental clouds surrounded by disks of 0.0010.3  m@xmath2 @xcite . at ages of a few myr",
    ", these disks appear to evolve rapidly from optically thick at near- and mid - infrared and detectable at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths , to undetectable at all wavelengths @xcite . the physics behind this transition and its timescale holds clues about the planet formation process @xcite .",
    "the previous references focus on inner disk material traced by infrared excess .",
    "much less is known about colder material further from the star , even though this encompasses the bulk of the mass .",
    "this letter investigates the presence of cold material around several members of the mbm  12 young association .    judging from the relative occurrences of k- ( @xmath6% ) and l- and n - band ( @xmath7% ) infrared excess , the mbm  12 ( l1457 ) young association is suspected to be at the very stage where disks start to disappear @xcite .",
    "after several unsuccessful attempts ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite recently reported detection at 1 and 2  mm of continuum emission around two or possibly three classical t  tauri stars in this 15  myr old association @xcite , indicating the presence of @xmath8  m@xmath2 of cold material around each object .",
    "this letter increases the number of detections of cold dust to four objects (  [ s : results ] ) , including the recently identified edge - on disk source lkh@xmath3  263  c @xcite . by extending the wavelength coverage into the submillimeter we can fit the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , and gain more robust disk - mass estimates and insight into grain growth (  [ s : models ] ) .",
    "the letter concludes with a discussion of the inferred mass range in terms of multiplicity @xcite and disk - dispersal models (  [ s : naturenurture ] ) .",
    "the observations were obtained with the _ submillimeter common user bolometer array _ ( scuba ) @xcite on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on 2002 december 12 under excellent weather conditions .",
    "typical opacities at 225  ghz were 0.040.06 .",
    "we obtained photometry of four systems : lkh@xmath3  262 , the triple lkh@xmath3  263 ( abc ) , lkh@xmath3  264 ( a ) , and the triple s18 ( abab ) ; table  [ t : obs ] lists coordinates and observing details . the employed two - bolometer photometry technique allowed for increased observing efficiency , with a chop throw of @xmath9 in naysmith coordinates .",
    "individual integrations of 30  s were repeated for the totals listed in the table . to confirm the unresolved nature of the emission we obtained a 64-point jiggle map centered on lkh@xmath3  262 also containing lkh@xmath3  263 ( abc ) . while providing spatial information , the jiggle map is less sensitive than the single - point photometry data .",
    "the standards hl  tau , crl  618 , and uranus provided focus checks and flux calibrations ; the nearby quasar 0235 + 164 served as pointing source every @xmath10 hours .",
    "pointing accuracy was good with excursions of less than a few arcsec",
    ". however , uncorrected pointing errors can still affect the photometry in the @xmath11 beam at 450  @xmath1 m . in spite of a @xmath12 dither included in the photometry , 450  @xmath1 m fluxes of lkh@xmath3  262 from photometry are lower by 60% than those from the jiggle map (  [ s : results ] ) .",
    "we conclude that uncorrected pointing offsets and calibration uncertainties at short wavelengths due to the imperfect beam shape of the jcmt resulted in 450  @xmath1 m photometry results that are strict lower limits to the actual source flux .",
    "we include a + 60% error in the uncertainty of the reported 450  @xmath1 m results . the 850  @xmath1 m photometry and the jiggle maps are unaffected .",
    "all four objects , containing a total of eight ( known ) stars , show emission at 850 and 450  @xmath1 m ( table  [ t : flux ] ) . the jiggle map ( fig .",
    "[ f : map ] ) indicates that the emission is unresolved and confined to the source position , and is not structure in the cloud . because of the higher noise level , only lkh@xmath3  262",
    "is detected in fig .",
    "[ f : map ] while lkh@xmath3  263 ( abc ) remain undetected .",
    "the separation of @xmath13 between lkh@xmath3  262 and 263 ( abc ) is large enough that @xmath142  mjy spill over at both wavelengths is expected , based on archival beam profiles .",
    "high signal - to - noise photometry and jiggle - map data of lkh@xmath3  262 are consistent at 850  @xmath1 m but discrepant at 450  @xmath1 m with respective fluxes of 166.2  mjy and 263.1  mjy .",
    "uncorrected pointing and calibration errors at 450  @xmath1 m are likely to blame (  [ s : obs ] ) ; the jiggle - map flux is extracted after gaussian profile fitting and does not suffer from pointing offsets .",
    "the reconcile the measurements , we include a + 60% error bar in table  [ t : flux ] and stress that the 450  @xmath1 m photometry values are strict lower limits .",
    "the 850450  @xmath1 m spectral indices @xmath3 consequently contain a large uncertainty ( table [ t : flux ] ) . at their high end ,",
    "corresponding to the high end of allowed 450  @xmath1 m fluxes , the indices ( @xmath151.52.5 ) are consistent with emission from cool ( @xmath16  k ) and coagulated dust grains . the spectral index @xmath17 , where the index of the dust emissivity @xmath18 decreases when grains coagulate ( e.g. , @xcite ) and where the slope of the planck function @xmath19 falls below the value of 2.0 outside the rayleigh - jeans limit when @xmath20  k at 450  @xmath1 m .",
    "[ f : seds ] plots our data and values from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; the + 60% error bars to the 450  @xmath1 m photometry are explicitly included . from these seds we can infer the mass of cold material .",
    "the 850  @xmath1 m fluxes trace the absolute amount of material , while the seds help to constrain important model parameters .",
    "we choose the flared - disk model of @xcite to describe the disks .",
    "we use the disk mass as our only free parameter .",
    "the disk temperature distribution is fixed by scaling to the stellar luminosity @xmath21 , where @xmath22  l@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "source luminosities @xmath23 are from @xcite .",
    "we neglect any changes in disk structure due to changes in mass and temperature .",
    "following recent reassessments of the distance to mbm  12 @xcite we adopt @xmath24  pc .",
    "we assume an average inclination of @xmath25 . because most of the flux comes from optically thin regions , only near",
    "edge - on orientations would change our results significantly .",
    "the final model parameter is the dust emissivity @xmath26 : its absolute value and its variation with wavelength .",
    "often , @xmath26 is parameterized as @xmath27 with @xmath28  @xmath29  g@xmath30 ( dust ) and @xmath31  hz @xcite . from disk",
    "sed fitting , low values of @xmath18 are commonly found , 01 @xcite and interpreted as evidence for grain growth ; @xcite point out that grain mineralogy can affect @xmath18 and explain the low values .",
    "more accurate descriptions of @xmath32 follow from calculations of grain growth in astrophysical environments employing realistic mineralogies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these models circumvent having to choose a value for @xmath33 , but still show show significant variation .",
    "we adopt a dual approach : we fit the seds with a parameterized @xmath26 to constrain @xmath18 and learn about possible grain growth , and then fit the seds with several physical grain - growth models to derive accurate disk masses with realistic uncertainties .",
    "with @xmath34 , @xmath35 minimization of the sed fit yields @xmath36 for lkh@xmath3  262 and @xmath37 for lkh@xmath3  264 ; the error bars for lkh@xmath3  263 and s18 are too large to constrain @xmath18 . for this fit",
    "we have used all detections and upper limits at wavelengths @xmath38  @xmath1 m . at the wavelengths of the infrared n - band and shorter ,",
    "the flux is dominated by very small amounts of hot material and may contain contributions from silicate emission ; both depend strongly on the model parameters .",
    "this does not affect our results : @xmath14% of the 450  @xmath1 m flux originates from the @xmath39  au region that contributes @xmath40% of the 10  @xmath1 m emission .",
    "the inferred values @xmath36 and @xmath41 are similar to those commonly found in t  tauri disks , and we interpret them as indications for grain growth in the mbm  12 disks .",
    "few of the grain - growth models of @xcite and @xcite have @xmath42 .",
    "of the models by @xcite , only strongly coagulated grains without ice mantles show such low @xmath18 .",
    "the authors note that such grains are unlikely in disk environments and we follow their advice and avoid this particular class . of the models by @xcite , @xmath42 is only found for average grain sizes @xmath43  cm .",
    "table  [ t : flux ] lists the range of disk masses found by @xmath35 minimization .",
    "these vary from 0.0014 - 0.012  m@xmath2 for lkh@xmath3  263 to 0.0230.23  m@xmath2 for lkh@xmath3  262 . the allowed range for each source reflects the uncertainty in the dust opacity models .",
    "these these ranges overlap , but differences in disk mass between sources are robust if we assume similar dust properties in all objects .",
    "our modeling makes no assumptions about the opacity .",
    "we find that @xmath44% of the 450  @xmath1 m flux and @xmath45% at 1.3  mm originates from opaque regions ( @xmath46 . only much smaller disks ( @xmath47  au ) have @xmath48% of the 450  @xmath1 m flux coming from optically thick regions ( 45% at 1.3  mm ) .",
    "for such disks the sed slope can be explained by opacity instead of grain growth , and submillimeter fluxes no longer trace mass . only spatially",
    "resolved data can settle this issue .",
    "@xcite infer 0.0018  m@xmath2 for lkh@xmath3  263  c from modeling the scattered light , depending on the assumed dust properties .",
    "our values of 0.00140.012  m@xmath2 are consistent with their findings .",
    "an unknown fraction of our inferred mass may reside in disks around the companions a and b. spatially resolved data and detailed modeling are required to further characterize the disk of lkh@xmath3  263  c.    @xmath4co 21 measurements @xcite indicate that co is depleted with respect to the dark cloud value of co / h@xmath49=@xmath50 by factors up to 300 . large depletion levels are found in disks around t  tauri stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) and expected theoretically ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although our sample is small , with only eight stars in four unresolved systems , interesting conclusions can be reached about the disk evolution .",
    "our detections show that at least the classical t  tauri stars in mbm  12 ( 15  myr ) have disks in the same mass range as the younger ( @xmath51  myr ) taurus and @xmath52  ophiuchus regions ( 0.0010.3  m@xmath2 ; @xcite ) . while @xcite shows that 0/95 stars in ic  348 ( @xmath10  myr ) have disk masses @xmath53  m@xmath2 , two out of four of our mbm  12 systems do ( or @xmath54% of all twelve mbm  12 systems ) ; in taurus , a comparable fraction of 14% of stars have disks @xmath53  m@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite argues that the k- and l - band excess suggest significant disk dispersal in mbm  12 .",
    "our sample does not directly address this issue because 3/4 objects have k - band excess ( s18 does not ) .",
    "@xcite showed that binaries with separations @xmath55100  au have reduced disk mass or no disks , compared to wider binaries and single stars .",
    "our data follow that trend , taking into account that the relative disk masses are robust (  [ s : models ] ) : lkh@xmath3  262 : @xmath56  au and 0.0230.23  m@xmath2 ; lkh@xmath3  264  a : @xmath57  au and 0.030.18  m@xmath2 ; s18  abab : @xmath58  au ( a  b ) , @xmath59  au ( ba  bb ) and 0.0050.025  m@xmath2 ; and lkh@xmath3  263  abc : @xmath60  au ( ab  c ) , @xmath61  au ( a  b ) and 0.00140.012  m@xmath2 ( binary separations from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the presence of a close binary ( environment ) determines the total amount of disk material .",
    "if environment determines ( initial ) disk mass , can we still infer anything about disk dispersal from the amount of material ? in a viscouly evolving disk , disk mass and the accretion rate onto the central star are linked @xcite .",
    "[ f : evol ] plots ` evolutionary tracks ' of disks with initial masses of 0.001 , 0.01 , and 0.1  m@xmath2 around a 0.5  m@xmath2 star , following @xcite .",
    "this model assumes a standard @xmath3-disk description with @xmath62 , a central star with @xmath63  m@xmath2 and @xmath64  r@xmath2 , and a constant ionizing flux from the star with time - dependent contribution from accretion .",

    "( in prep . )",
    "report estimates of mass accretion rates onto three of our objects from br@xmath19 line measurements , using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "they find upper limits of ( 45)@xmath65  m@xmath2  yr@xmath30 for lkh@xmath3  263 and 264 , and a rate of @xmath66  m@xmath2  yr@xmath30 for s18 .",
    "these rates are comparable to those inferred for ic  348 @xcite and at the low end of the range found in taurus , which has a median of @xmath67  m@xmath2  yr@xmath30 .",
    "the errors include uncertainties in the observations and the stellar mass , assumed to be 0.5  m@xmath2 , but not the distance .",
    "because both accretion rate and disk mass depend on the distance squared , its uncertainty does not enter into the values of fig .",
    "[ f : evol ] ; @xmath68 also depends on @xmath69 , which we assume constant .",
    "the disk mass and accretion rate of s18 are consistent with the dispersal model for the age range of mbm  12 ( 15  myr ; shaded in fig .",

    "the upper limit on the accretion rate of lkh@xmath3  264 also agrees with the model at 15  myr .",
    "the agreement improves if the disk mass is decreased somewhat , which is expected when dust grains have indeed grown to a few hundred @xmath1 m as suggested by the sed .",
