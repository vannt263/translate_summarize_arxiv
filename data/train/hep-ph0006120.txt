    "the recent measurement of a non - zero value of @xmath3  @xcite establishes the existence of cp violation in direct decay and thus provides an important first check of the mechanism of cp violation in the standard model ( sm ) .",

    "this compels us to scrutinize the sm prediction in further detail : we study isospin - violating effects arising from the @xmath0-@xmath1 quark mass difference .",

    "the differing charges of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks engender @xmath2 electroweak penguin contributions , whereas mixing , driven by the @xmath0-@xmath1 quark mass difference , modifies the relative contribution of the @xmath7 and @xmath2 amplitudes in a significant way .    here",
    "we describe isospin - breaking effects in the matrix elements of the gluonic penguin operators  @xcite , such as @xmath9 .",
    "these operators have always been thought to induce exclusively @xmath10 transitions , but this is true only in the limit of isospin symmetry .",
    "the difference in the up and down quark masses effectively distinguishes the interaction of gluons with up and down quarks , so that the @xmath11 matrix element possesses a @xmath2 component as well  @xcite .",
