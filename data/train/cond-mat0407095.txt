    ", the quantum kinetic pressure counterbalances an attractive interatomic interaction , allowing a stable bright soliton to be formed .",
    "however , in 2d or higher dimensions , bright solitons are always unstable against collapse or expansion as long as the attractive interaction is constant in time  @xcite .",

    "@xcite and by us  @xcite that by rapid oscillations of interaction between attractive and repulsive through , e.g. , the feshbach resonance  @xcite , a bec can be stabilized in a quasi 2d space without a radial trapping potential .",
    "the mechanism of the stabilization is similar to that of an inverted pendulum , in which a bob is stabilized above the vertically oscillating pivot  @xcite .",
    "however , the stabilization of a bec in 3d free space has been elusive due to complex dynamical instabilities inherent in nonlinear nonequilibrium systems .    in the present paper , we show that a droplet  @xcite of a bec can be stabilized in 3d free space by using oscillating interactions . in order to simulate experimental situations at finite temperature",
    ", we take into account the effect of dissipation caused by the interaction between a bec and a thermal cloud .",
    "this can be incorporated in mean field theory by a non - unitary term added to the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "this model has successfully been used to describe damping of collective modes  @xcite and vortex nucleation  @xcite .",
    "we find that the dissipation plays a crucial role in the stabilization of a bec droplet by suppressing the dynamical instabilities , and show that the droplet can indeed be stabilized for a realistic amount of dissipation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s : gp ] introduces the gp equation with oscillating interactions , and shows that the dependence of the dynamics on the oscillation frequency can be eliminated by the scaling property when a trapping potential vanishes .",
    "section  [ s : num ] presents the main results of this paper , in which a bec droplet is shown to be stabilized in 3d free space by use of oscillating interactions .",
    "the stability diagrams with respect to the interaction and dissipative parameters are also obtained .",

    "[ s : conc ] concludes this paper .",
    "we consider the gp equation in the presence of dissipation given by  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a phenomenological dissipation constant which is to be determined experimentally , and the trapping potential @xmath2 and the s - wave scattering length @xmath3 are controlled to vary in time .",

    "the s - wave scattering length is made to oscillate as @xmath10 where @xmath11 ramps up from 0 to 1 .",
    "the ramp functions @xmath8 and @xmath11 are introduced to avoid initial nonadiabatic disturbances that cause dynamic instabilities .",
    "these functions must be chosen so that neither collapse nor expansion occurs in the course of the ramping .",
    "normalizing the length , time , energy , and wave function by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively , we obtain the normalized form of the gp equation : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and the wave function is normalized as @xmath18 .",
    "it should be noted that once the trapping potential is switched off [ @xmath19 , eq .  ( [ gpn ] ) no longer depends on @xmath20 explicitly .",
    "this implies that the @xmath20 dependence can be eliminated by appropriate scaling of the time , length , and interaction .",
    "the dynamics at driving frequency @xmath21 can be reduced to those at @xmath20 by rescaling @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "for example , if large @xmath20 is unavailable experimentally , we have only to increase the strength of interaction and enlarge the size of the bec droplet .",
    "we numerically solve the gp equation ( [ gpn ] ) using the crank - nicholson scheme  @xcite , where the following simple forms of the ramp functions are used : @xmath25 we use a quadratic function for @xmath11 because it makes initial nonadiabatic disturbances smaller than linear ramps .",

    "the instability regions enlarge as compared with those of fig  [ f : contour ] ( a ) , and the stability region disappears . from this result , we conclude that the stability region exists only for @xmath59 . however , we can not exclude the possibility that other stable states exist , since we do not investigate the entire functional space .    in numerical calculations of the time evolution , we must pay special attention to the boundary effect .",
    "since the trapping potential is absent , the atoms that escape from the droplet spread out , reflect at the boundary , and return to the droplet region , producing spurious boundary effects .",
    "for example , when the dirichlet boundary condition is imposed at @xmath60 , the lifetime of the droplet ( whose definition is the same as in fig .",
    "[ f : contour ] ) for @xmath28 and @xmath61 becomes @xmath62 , while the correct value is @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the spatial cutoff in the numerical analysis must be much larger than the size of the droplet .",
    "the numerical simulations that we have presented so far have been carried out under the assumption of the spherical symmetry of the system . however , this geometry can not generate multipole dynamical instabilities which destroy a bec droplet . in order to check the absence of such multipole instabilities , we have performed full 3d calculations by discretizing the space of @xmath64 size in our dimensionless unit into a @xmath65 mesh . a limited spatial size due to",

    "we note that the gaussian function in fig  [ f : diff ] ( a ) is almost the same as that in fig  [ f : diff ] ( b ) .",
