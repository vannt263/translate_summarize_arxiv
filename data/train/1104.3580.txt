    "does the formation of a massive star differ significantly from that of a low mass star ?",
    "this is the question at the core of all studies of high mass star formation to date .",
    "the fact that massive stars can have kelvin - helmholtz time - scales shorter than their accretion time - scales @xcite , leads to the consequence that their main - sequence radiation can affect their own formation . hence ,",
    "several processes such as radiation pressure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ionization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may halt , decrease or alter accretion on to the star .    with the hypothesis that these differences do not radically change the formation of massive stars ,",
    "our main aim is to find observational evidence to suggest the contrary . in this paper",
    ", we aim to determine whether the standard envelope plus disc model used to reproduce the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of low mass stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* henceforth kz10 ) have recently modelled the line profiles of several millimetre - wavelength transitions of nh@xmath1 , c@xmath2s and ch@xmath1cn toward iras20126 + 4104 , fitting these data with two models , the first consisting of an azimuthally symmetric rotationally flattened envelope , and the second also including a flared keplerian disc .",
    "they found that the addition of a disc was required to reproduce the velocity structure of the accreting gas within 0.128pc of the star , providing a better fit than the without - disc model .",
    "additionally , as the model with a disc was able to adequately reproduce the data , their results showed no evidence that ionization or radiation pressure are profoundly altering the dynamics of the surrounding accretion flow . in this work ,",
    "we carry out the same experiment , but instead model the sed and observed infrared images of iras20126 + 4104 .    in comparison to the molecular line data , the sed and infrared images of iras20126 + 4104 probe different aspects of the circumstellar material .",
    "the molecular line observations are able to measure the velocity of the gas at different temperatures , however their density determinations depend on abundances that are highly uncertain .",
    "in contrast , the sed and infrared images probe the dust out to the edge of the envelope , which can be used to infer the structure of the gas .",
    "hence , comparing the results from both these datasets will allow us to obtain a more complete picture of the star formation processes occurring in iras20126 + 4104 .",

    "further evidence of a disc is also provided by near and mid - infrared images of iras20126 + 4104 @xcite , which show a dark lane with a similar size and orientation to the disc seen in radio observations . a large ( radius@xmath01000au ) rotating structure traced by",

    "however , recently @xcite have presented a high - resolution ( 0.6 \" ) 24.5@xmath7 m image of iras20126 + 4104 , at a slightly longer wavelength than those presented in @xcite ( @xcite , 12.5 and 18.3@xmath7 m ) , which does not contain a dark lane .",
    "the infrared to sub - millimetre sed of iras20126 + 4104 has been previously modelled on several occasions .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite modelled the far - ir to millimetre sed using a simple greybody to determine the dust temperature and the dust emissivity index .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have also modelled the sed of iras20126 + 4104 using spherically symmetric models , to determine the properties of the envelope .",
    "more recently , @xcite modelled iras20126 + 4104 using the radiation transfer code previously employed in @xcite . their model consisted of a spherical halo with a power - law density between radii of 850au and 0.54pc , plus a constant density cylindrical edge - on disc with radii between 34 - 850au and a height of 640au .",
    "the model provided a good fit to the data down to @xmath08@xmath7 m , however , they suggested that adding further components to the model , such as bipolar cavities and a more complex disc geometry , would improve the fit , especially in the near- to mid - ir section of the sed . in this paper , we improve upon previous infrared modelling and derive complimentary information about the properties of iras20126 + 4104 not previously obtainable from molecular line observations .",
    "we present the observed sed , infrared images and measured brightness profiles of iras20126 + 4104 in section [ data ] ; section [ dustcode ] describes the radiation transfer dust code used to model them ; section [ modelling ] details the modelling , including model input assumptions , fitting and the genetic search algorithm used to search for the best - fitting set of model parameters ; and section [ results ] presents our results , including a comparison to the results of kz10 .",
    "we give our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",

    "are discussed further in section  [ results ] .",
    "the sed data points were collected from the literature ; table [ obstable ] lists the wavelength , flux and reference for the data displayed in figure  [ seddata ] .",
    "if the fluxes were derived from apparent magnitudes , these are also given in table [ obstable ] .",
    "we attempted to make sure all fluxes contained all of the flux from the source .",

    "< , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tablecompare ]      here we discuss the properties of the disc around iras20126 + 4104 suggested by our results .",
    "the disc radius @xmath8 for the envelope plus disc model was found by the genetic code to be 9200@xmath9au . for a keplerian velocity of 1.11kms@xmath10 at @xmath8 ,",
    "the outer radius of the disc would therefore take @xmath03@xmath11yr to complete one orbit . as this is on the order of the time massive stars",
    "spend in their accretion phase , it appears unlikely that the outer regions of the disc will have had the time to reach centrifugal or hydrostatic equilibrium , which occur on approximately the same time - scales .",
    "however , our results show that , in addition to the rotationally flattened envelope , extra mass arranged in some form of flattened structure is required , for radii up to 9200au , to reproduce the observed sed and profiles .",
    "as the dust code calculates the temperature of the envelope and disc geometry , we were able to calculate the toomre q parameter @xcite - a measure of stability towards fragmentation - in the midplane of the disc as a function of radius , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the speed of sound in the gas , @xmath14 is the angular velocity of the disc , @xmath15 is the gravitational constant and @xmath16 is the surface density of the disc .",
    "we found the surface density as a function of radius by integrating equation [ discdensity ] over the disc height @xmath17 . to find the sound speed",
    ", we assumed an ideal gas composed of molecular hydrogen , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath20 is the temperature calculated by the dust code and @xmath21 is the average molecular mass of the gas .",
    "the toomre parameter in the disc midplane as a function of disc radius for the best - fitting envelope with disc model is shown as a black line in figure [ toomre ] . from this",
    ", we see that the disc is stable ( @xmath22 ) , and only reaches a value less than unity at radii greater than the disc radius . thus the high temperatures and low densities within the disc stabilise it against local fragmentation .",
    "we also show as grey lines the toomre parameter for the models with reduced @xmath23 , which , apart from one model , lie close to or above 1 at the disc radius .",
    "therefore we conclude that across the range of uncertainty in the disc properties , the disc around iras20126 + 4104 is still stable to fragmentation .    ) for the best - fitting envelope with disc model , shown as a black line , and for the models with reduced @xmath2420 , shown as grey lines.,width=336 ]",
    "in order to determine whether the standard model of low - mass star formation can also apply to massive stars , we have modelled the near - ir to sub - millimetre sed and several mid - ir images of the accreting embedded massive star iras20126 + 4104 , using model geometries which are commonly used to describe forming low - mass stars .",
    "we have used a monte carlo radiative transfer dust code to model the continuum absorption , emission and scattering through two scaled - up azimuthally symmetric dust geometries , the first consisting of a rotationally flattened envelope with outflow cavities , and the second which also includes a flared disc .    to find the best - fitting set of model parameters , we used a genetic algorithm to search parameter space , within parameter ranges which bracketed previous results or were physically plausible .",
    "this also allowed us to produce minimum @xmath25 surfaces for each parameter , from which we could infer how well the sed and image profiles constrained them .",
    "we found that the two parameters most constrained by the data were the stellar mass and envelope accretion rate , which were determined to be @xmath013@xmath26 and @xmath27yr@xmath10 respectively for the envelope plus disc model , and @xmath012@xmath26 and @xmath28yr@xmath10 for the envelope without disc model .",
    "these two parameters are actually proxies for other more directly determined properties of the source - the stellar mass in the models is a proxy for the stellar luminosity , and the envelope accretion rate is a proxy for the total mass in the envelope , which is constrained by the millimetre fluxes . the stellar luminosities for both the envelope plus and without disc models respectively are @xmath29 and @xmath30l@xmath31 , and the total masses within @xmath32 are 649 and 375m@xmath31 . the best - fitting values of the remaining parameters are given in table  [ bestfit ] .",
    "our results show that the envelope plus disc model reproduces the observed sed and images better than the envelope without disc model , although the model without a disc appears to better - reproduce the morphology of the mid - ir emission within a radius of @xmath01800au .",
    "we have outlined several possible causes of this discontinuity , such as inner disc truncation or outflow precession .",
    "it may be that the observed mid - ir images , which can not be fully explained by the envelope plus disc model , are showing the effect of the radiation of a massive star on its accreting material .",
    "however , future observations and modelling are needed to determine whether precession and/or a young protostellar companion are more likely explanations .",
    "comparing our results to those of kz10 , we note that both studies find that a model with a disc reproduces the observations more successfully than one without .",
    "although both studies modelled completely different observations using different techniques , we find that our best - fitting model parameters are similar to those found by kz10 . while we find a higher envelope accretion rate than kz10 , and therefore a higher envelope density and total envelope mass , this difference may be due to the fact that the masses determined from the molecular line modelling depend on the assumed molecular abundances .",
    "for example , increasing the assumed molecular abundances by a factor of 3 - 5 would bring these values into agreement .",
    "in addition , as the observed sed is more sensitive to emission from the entire envelope , not only the material within a radius of 26,400au modelled by kz10 , we were able to probe the mass in the envelope more accurately .",
    "our best fitting envelope plus disc model has a disc radius of 9200au . as at this radius",
    "the disc requires @xmath03@xmath11yr to complete one orbit , we find it is unlikely that the outer regions of the disc have had time to reach centrifugal or hydrostatic equilibrium . however , by using the temperature along the disc midplane found by the dust code , we calculate that this disc would be stable to local fragmentation .",
    "the authors would like to thank t.k .",
    "sridharan , j. de buizer , and w. de wit for providing electronic versions of their infrared images to include in this work , and also the anonymous referee , who provided many insightful comments which significantly improved the paper ."
