    "a fundamental conundrum of astrophysical jet models is how energy is extracted from the accretion flow close to the black hole event horizon .",
    "the total energy carried by the jets of active galaxies is estimated to be a non - negligible fraction of the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) formation energy , @xmath3 ( kronberg et al .",
    "the jets are initially highly relativistic and low - density and for this reason are thought to be _ magnetically dominated _ or force - free with a negligible fraction of the power in particle kinetic energy . that is , the energy outflow from the accretion disk is in the form of a collimated ` poynting - flux jet ' as proposed by lovelace ( 1976 ) and blandford ( 1976 ) and subsequently studied in many papers ( benford 1978 ; lovelace , wang , & sulkanen 1987 ; lynden - bell 1996 ; li , et al .",
    "2001 ; lovelace , et al . 2002 ; 2003 ; nakamura et al .",
    "the model has a current outflow ( or inflow ) @xmath4 along the spine of the jet of cylindrical radius @xmath5 initially of the order of the schwarzschild radius of the black hole .",
    "the associated toroidal magnetic field is responsible for collimating the jet .",
    "an equal but opposite `` return current '' flows inward ( or outward ) at much larger distances from the jet axis so that the net current outflow from the source is zero . because the jet current and its return have opposite signs they repel , as a result of their magnetic interaction mediated by the toroidal magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "this repulsion between the jet and its ( more spatially distributed ) return current has been demonstrated in mhd simulations ( ustyugova et al .",
    "2000 , 2006 ,    nakamura et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "rotation measure gradients observed on parsec scales close to the nuclear central black hole have provided evidence consistent with an electric current flow ( asada _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ; gabuzda , murray , & cronin 2004 ; zavala & taylor 2005 ) . here , on a scale @xmath7 times larger in a `` mature '' jet , we present a measured estimate of the jet s net axial current , and its sign .",
    "3c303 was observed in the vla s most extended `` a '' configuration in stokes parameters i , q , u in the 1.4 , 4.9 and 15ghz radio bands with maximal @xmath8 coverage over an 11.5 hour observing period in april 1981 .",
    "calibrated images have been discussed and analyzed in kronberg ( 1986 ) and lapenta and kronberg ( 2005 - hereafter lk05 ) . in 2010 and 2011 ,",
    "the 1.4 and 4.9 ghz images were re - edited ( flagged ) , re - calibrated and re - imaged using more updated aips imaging procedures , partly as a check of the earlier 1980 s imaging procedures .",
    "excellent correspondence was found , though the more recent procedures permitted better imaging of the faintest structures . due to the higher noise levels and sparser aperture plane ( @xmath8 ) coverage of the 15 ghz data",
    "they are not presented here , though they are useful for confirming the main image features at a resolution of @xmath9 , and the lack of any detectable faraday rotation between 15 and 4.9 ghz .",
    "the 3c303 radio source at @xmath10 ( figures 1,2 ) has a one - sided prominent jet with regular repeating knot structures in both vla radio ( kronberg , 1976 , 1986 ; lapenta & kronberg 2005 ( lk05 ) , and chandra x - ray bands ( kataoka et al .",
    "it resides in a relatively sparsely populated intergalactic environment , and at a high galactic latitude [ ( @xmath11,@xmath12 ) = + 90@xmath13.5 , + 57@xmath13.5 ] .",
    "being away from a galaxy cluster , it is well - suited to an analysis of faraday rotation measures ( rm ) within the jet and lobes , since competing faraday rm from an immediate cluster environment and the galactic foreground are small .",
    "given this situation , we applied improved , new determinations of the rm s of neighboring background radio sources ( kronberg & newton - mcgee 2011 ) .",
    "this allows the most accurate available estimate of the `` rm zero - level '' , so that our observed rm gradients and rm=0 crossings are minimally affected by foreground plasma ( section 5 ) .    the above combination of radio and x - ray images plus background source rm s permits the jet s physical parameters , including now its current , to be analysed in isolation .",
    "3c303 s radiating knots are large , a few _ thousand _ times larger in volume than those in , for example , the well - studied nearby m87 radio galaxy .",
    "the laterally unresolved `` spine '' of its jet is surrounded by a `` cocoon '' of relativistic , radio and x - ray - visible , gas mixed with thermal plasma which has both a low plasma - @xmath14 ( ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure ) and a highly ordered magnetic field structure ( fig.1 ) .     the plasma @xmath14 along with the other plasma parameter , and minimum energy estimates are derived and presented in lk05 , which can be consulted for further details .",
    "we distinguish the jet spine , of cylindrical radius @xmath5 normal to the propagation direction ( @xmath15 ) and which is laterally unresolved and appears to carry the jet power , from the `` knots '' , which are partially resolved `` cocoons '' around the unresolved `` spine '' .",
    "the cocoons contain a mix of magnetized thermal and relativistic plasma .",
    "we find no detectable growth in the knot widths away from the agn , which puts an _ upper limit _ of 0.7@xmath16 on the opening angle of the jet .    the jet s regular structure , combined with the appearance of a transverse , magnetically coherent",
    ", western lobe complex also suggests it as a clear laboratory of jet disruption .",
    "the disruption point is indicated in figure 1 .",
    "model simulations by lk05 applied mhd soliton - like solutions of the grad - shafranov equation to the radio and x - ray radio images of the regular knot structure of the 3c303 jet .",
    "their models successfully computed jet stability times and constrained its plasma parameters .",
    "the above analysis forms a basis for this paper , independent of the mhd model details in lk05 .",
    "it is the visible , synchrotron radiating cocoon surrounding the jet that enables us to probe the current , most of which is probably confined to the unresolved `` spine '' .",
    "it is also apparent that the jet continues beyond the disruption point in figure 1 , and terminates in a bow shock - like extremity to the west . to the east ,",
    "a large polarized loop is also seen , as well as a possibly related `` counter hotspot '' that aligns with the western jet .",
    "we do not attempt interepretion of these latter two features in this _ letter _ , and defer them to a following paper .",
    "below , we describe a rare opportunity to measure the faraday rotation ( rm ) variation transverse to , and along , a segment of the jet in knot e3 ( figure 1 ) . combined with the full plasma diagnostics , and a determination of the rm zero - level from surrounding sources this provides , for the first time , a direct estimate of both the magnitude and sign of a jet s _ electric current _ on kiloparsec scales in a low density intergalactic environment .    the partial resolution of the knots in the vla images at 1.4 and 4.9 ghz permits estimates of the relativistic gas density and approximate magnetic field energy within each kpc@xmath2 scale synchrotron radiating knot ( cocoon ) .    the first stage in measuring the jet current is to calculate the approximate magnetic field strengths in the knots using the analysis described in lk05",
    "note that the knots equipartition magnetic field strength estimates depend only weakly on the volume filling @xmath17 , as @xmath18 , and on the upper cutoff frequency of the photon spectrum of the jet s emission .",
    "the latter extends to 10@xmath19 hz ( kataoka _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) , and its reduction by , say @xmath20 , would reduce the ( redshift - corrected ) total energy content in the knots by only @xmath21 . at lower particle energies the uncertain extrapolation of the knots relativistic particle energy spectrum , corresponding to ( unobserved ) very low radio frequencies , could in principle raise our estimate of @xmath22 by a modest factor less than unity , however no anomalously steep spectrum between 1.4 and 4.9 ghz is seen in the region of the 3c303 jet .",
    "we estimate a field strength in 3c303 s jet knots , where @xmath23 milligauss ( lk05 ) , measured with a @xmath24 beam and allowing for some out - of - plane component due to the expected helical form of the jet s magnetic field .    at the 0.35@xmath25 resolution of the 4.9ghz vla image ( figure 2 ) the projected line - of - sight magnetic field orientation within each knot is parallel to the jet axis .",
    "the 4.9ghz percentage polarizations of knots e@xmath26 , e@xmath27 , and e@xmath28 are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively , and the knots are elongated in the projected jet direction by @xmath32 .",
    "figure 3 shows the 2-d rm variation within the brighter parts of the entire 3c303 system derived from the @xmath33 and @xmath34 ghz images at a common @xmath35 resolution .",
    "values range between @xmath36 and @xmath37 rad m@xmath38 over a maximum extent of @xmath39 , including 3c303 s extended western lobe .",
    "no higher rm s are seen anywhere within the source boundaries .",
    "one test for a 180@xmath40 ambiguity in @xmath41 is to separately produce q and u images at the higher frequency of 5ghz , where we can test for `` exchanges '' between q and u along the jet .",
    "none were found , meaning that no substantially higher rm s occured in or around the jet .",
    "the ambiguity - free rm of 3c303 s integrated emission ( from polarization data at 6 frequencies ) is + 18 @xmath42 2 rad m@xmath38 ( simard - normandin et al .",
    "this is nicely concordant with the rm range in figure 3 , after the -18 rad m@xmath43 correction above for the independent foreground rm estimate in @xmath44 below .",
    "the jet knot e3 is resolved just enough both across and along the jet , to show an rm gradient which is independently transverse to the jet axis .",
    "the varying rm in knot e3 also independently confirms the presence of some thermal plasma in the cocoon .",
    "the rm gradient , @xmath45 around knot e3 is @xmath46 radians m@xmath47 . because the rm in fig .",
    "3 is resolved in 2d over 10 - 12 independent sampling points in a projected @xmath48 plane around knot e3 , we are able to specify both the magnitude and direction of @xmath45 within the knot e3 cocoon .    having measured a differential rm over the knot , its dimension , and the approximate magnetic field strength , we can estimate the non - relativistic plasma density within the knot via the following equation . @xmath49",
    "@xmath50 where @xmath51 is the line - of - sight distance through the knot . inserting @xmath52 and @xmath51",
    "gives @xmath53@xmath54 , similar to the value obtained in lk05 .",
    "an independent estimate of @xmath55 can be made from the observed polarization _",
    "degree _ in the knots . on the reasonable assumption that the very regular field geometry in knot @xmath56 results from a helical geometry , knot - internal faraday dispersion is limited by the high observed degree of polarization @xmath57 at @xmath58 ghz .",
    "this test implies a back - to - front , knot - internal differential faraday rotation at 5ghz of @xmath59 , consistent with the knot s rm observed above ( lk05 ) .",
    "it is consistent with the above @xmath55 estimate and gives us confidence in the local @xmath60 scaling that is required to estimate the jet current - which we discuss next .    this low value of @xmath60 outside the jet spine points to a magnetically confined ( or dominated ) jet ( lk05 ) : confinement of the jet by hot gas at x - ray temperatures is not possible because @xmath61 .",
    "a common feature of the magnetic jets is that the internal pressure of the magnetic field @xmath62 ( and relativistic particles ) is confined by the pinch force of the external toroidal magnetic field @xmath63 .",
    "the models give @xmath64 ( lk05 ) .",
    "an important final step in relating ( @xmath65rm ) to an axial current is to calibrate the rm zero level .",
    "this was done by averaging discrete source rm s along neighboring lines of sight to 3c303 from a recent accurate rm dataset ( simard - normandin et al .",
    "1981 , kronberg & newton - mcgee 2011 ) .",
    "the resulting rm zero - level correction , @xmath66rad m@xmath38 , has been applied to the rm scale of figure 3 . with this zero - level correction",
    ", we find that the rm in knot e3 changes sign _ on _ the jet axis , within the limit of our uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , its gradient ( @xmath65rm = @xmath67 ) is found to be perpendicular to the ( independently measured ) axis of knot e3 and the jet axis .",
    "this corresponds to the expected rm behavior around an electric current flowing along a jet axis ,    the reversal of the rm sign on the jet axis matches the signature of a current - carrying cylinder , where we are measuring the azimuthal component of a helical magnetic field at distances @xmath68 on opposite sides of the synchrotron radiating cocoon surrounding the unresolved spine of the jet . in terms",
    "the measurables , the inferred current , @xmath69 is the total current within the cocoon s radius @xmath70 . over this distance",
    "we measure @xmath71rm of @xmath72 + 10 rad m@xmath38/kpc .",
    "thus , within knot e3 @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the toroidal component of magnetic field at a distance @xmath70 in the sky plane from the jet ( @xmath15 ) axis .",
    "the positive sign of the gradient @xmath71(rm ) indicates that a current of @xmath723.85 @xmath75 10@xmath76 a , for @xmath77=0.5 mg , is directed _ away _ from the galaxy nucleus .",
    "that is , within @xmath78 kpc of the jet axis there is a net flow of negative charge toward the agn core within knot e3 .",
    "our result for the jet current is subject to different corrections and adjustments : for example , ( 1 ) if the jet axis is significantly out of the plane of the sky then the observed rm gradient can arise from a purely toroidal field , but a helical field would in this case shift the rm@xmath79 line away from the jet s axis , contrary to the present observations .",
    "( 2 ) in another example if the magnetic field of the jet is not symmetric about its axis the field estimates will be modified .",
    "such possibilities , especially ( 1 ) , underline the importance of establishing from observations , an optimally foreground - free rm ( @xmath70,@xmath15 ) over the source image , as we have done here . considering these uncertainties and the limited angular resolution ,",
    "our best estimate of the axial jet current at knot e3 is 10@xmath80 ampres .",
    "this is the first direct estimate of a current in a kpc - scale extragalactic jet .",
    "a magnetically dominated jet can be modeled as a transmission line running in the @xmath81direction with the electric potential drop across it @xmath82 .",
    "this is equal to the potential drop across the bh accretion disk from its inner- to outer radius ( lovelace 1976 ; lovelace and ruchti 1983 ) .",
    "a typical value is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the poloidal magnetic field strength near the black hole and @xmath85 is its mass ( lovelace 1976 ) . the current flow in this `` transmission line '' is @xmath86 , where the impedance of a _ relativistic _",
    "jet is @xmath87 ( lovelace 1976 ) . more generally , for a jet with bulk axial velocity @xmath88 , @xmath89 , ( lovelace & romanova 2003 ) .",
    "the electromagnetic power transported by the jet is @xmath90 .",
    "we can now apply these ideas to the 3c303 system .",
    "the total photon luminosity @xmath91 integrated from @xmath92hz to @xmath93hz is about @xmath94 erg s@xmath95 or 3.7@xmath75 10@xmath96w ( lk05 ) .",
    "the radiated power is expected to be significantly less than the jet power , because the jet power goes into a combination of @xmath97 work on the ambient medium , and to energizing electrons and ions around the jet and in the outer radiating lobes .",
    "thus , we let @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is an efficiency factor . substituting the observed values of @xmath91 and @xmath4 we find @xmath100 @xmath101 where we have normalized the jet bulk velocity to @xmath102 .",
    "note that @xmath103 is safely less than unity , and the model of poynting flux transport of jet energy in 3c 303 s black hole / accretion disk system appears to be self - consistent .",
    "the system evidently needs to incorporate a `` transducer '' that converts the poynting energy flux into high energy particles which then produce synchrotron radiation .",
    "these issues , and the complex lobe structure will be discussed in a subsequent paper .",
    "we thank rick perley , robert reid , justin linford and greg taylor for help and advice with the re - calibrated images , hui li for discussion of current flow in jets , and an anonymous referee for a valuable correction to our estimate of the jet current .",
