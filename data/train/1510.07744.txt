    "recently , there has been much interest in the complexity of colouring , homomorphism , and matrix partition problems for restricted graph classes .",
    "these typically include the class of perfect graphs or its subclasses ( chordal , interval , split graphs ) , or graphs without certain forbidden induced subgraphs @xcite . here",
    "we study similar questions for a restricted class of _ digraphs _ , namely , for transitive digraphs . as far as we know , this is the first paper concerned with the complexity of homomorphisms , or matrix partition problems of any restricted digraph class .",
    "transitive digraphs are known to have a very nice structure @xcite , and many hard problems are known to become easy when restricted to transitive digraphs @xcite .",
    "yet we find that even for this relatively simple class there are difficult complexity problems for colourings , homomorphisms , and matrix partitions .",
    "we make an initial study of these problems and identify interesting open questions .    given a fixed digraph @xmath1 , an @xmath1-colouring of a digraph @xmath2 is a homomorphism of @xmath2 to @xmath1 , i.e. , a mapping @xmath3 such that @xmath4 is an arc of @xmath1 whenever @xmath5 is an arc of @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath1-_colouring problem _ asks whether an input digraph @xmath2 admits an @xmath1-colouring . in the _ list",
    "_ @xmath1-_colouring problem _ the input @xmath2 comes equipped with lists @xmath6 , and the homomorphism @xmath7 must also satisfy @xmath8 for all vertices @xmath9 . finally , the @xmath1-_retraction problem _ is a special case of the list @xmath1-colouring problem , in which each list is either @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "we also mention the more general _ constraint satisfaction problem for @xmath1 _ , which is defined the same way as the @xmath1-colouring problem , except the structure @xmath1 is not necessarily just a digraph ( i.e. , a structure with one binary relation ) , but a structure with any finite number of relations of finite arities .",
    "the input @xmath2 is also a structure with corresponding relations , and the homomorphism must preserve all relations , see @xcite for details .    instead of the digraph @xmath1",
    "we may consider a _",
    "@xmath1 @xcite ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ; in a trigraph , arcs ( including loops ) can be _",
    "strong _ or _",
    "weak_. an @xmath1-colouring of a digraph @xmath2 in this case is a mapping @xmath3 such that @xmath4 is a weak arc or a strong arc of @xmath1 whenever @xmath5 is an arc of @xmath2 , and @xmath4 is a weak arc or a non - arc of @xmath1 whenever @xmath5 is a non - arc of @xmath2 .",
    "each trigraph @xmath1 can also be encoded as an @xmath12 by @xmath12 matrix @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) , in which @xmath15 if @xmath16 is a non - arc ( non - loop if @xmath17 ) of @xmath1 , @xmath18 if @xmath16 is a weak arc ( weak loop if @xmath17 ) of @xmath1 , and @xmath19 if @xmath16 is a strong arc ( strong loop if @xmath17 ) of @xmath1 .",
    "we say that @xmath13 is the matrix _ corresponding to _ @xmath1 .",
    "then an @xmath1-colouring of a digraph @xmath2 is a partition of @xmath20 to parts @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 is a strong clique of @xmath2 if @xmath23 and is an independent set of @xmath2 if @xmath24 ; and similarly there are all arcs from @xmath22 to @xmath25 in @xmath2 if @xmath19 and no arcs from @xmath22 to @xmath25 in @xmath2 if @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "such a partition is called an @xmath13-_partition _ , or simply a _ matrix partition_. ( we note that a matrix partition problem is not directly a constraint satisfaction problem , since the strong arc constraints are of different nature . )    if @xmath1 is a digraph or a trigraph , a _",
    "minimal @xmath1-obstruction _ is a digraph @xmath2 which is not @xmath1-colourable , but for which all vertex removed subgraphs @xmath26 are @xmath1-colourable .",
    "if @xmath1 is a trigraph described by a matrix @xmath13 , we also call it a _ minimal @xmath13-obstruction_. in certain cases , the number of minimal @xmath1-obstructions is finite : for instance when @xmath1 is the trigraph with one strong loop at @xmath27 and one weak undirected edge @xmath28 , the class of graphs that are @xmath1-colourable is the class of split graphs , characterized by the absence of three induced subgraphs ( @xmath29 ) @xcite , and hence for this @xmath1 there are three minimal @xmath1-obstructions .",
    "in such a case , obviously the @xmath1-colouring problem is polynomial time solvable .",
    "in other cases , the number of minimal @xmath1-obstructions is infinite , but the problem is still solvable in polynomial time : for instance when @xmath30 , the class of @xmath1-colourable graphs is the class of bipartite graphs , recognizable in polynomial time , while the minimal obstructions are all odd cycles . finally , in other cases , the problem is np - complete , such as , say , when @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth noting that the input digraphs @xmath2 never have loops , whether for @xmath1-colouring or @xmath13-partition problems .",
    "it is traditional in graph theory to define transitive digraphs in which there are no loops but symmetric edges are allowed .",
    "specifically a digraph @xmath1 is defined to be _ transitive _ if for any three _",
    "vertices @xmath32 , the existence of the arcs @xmath33 implies the existence of the arc @xmath34 .",
    "note that an acyclic digraph is transitive if and only if the arcs define a transitive relation in the usual sense .",
    "however , a digraph with a directed cycle is transitive if and only if its reflexive closure ( i.e. , adding all loops ) defines a transitive relation .",
    "this peculiarity means that , for instance , when taking a transitive closure of a digraph we omit any loops that would exist in a transitive closure as a binary relation .    acyclic transitive digraphs have particularly simple structure , namely , they are exactly those digraphs whose reflexive closure is a partial order .",
    "it is well known @xcite , that each transitive digraph @xmath2 is obtained from an acyclic transitive digraph @xmath35 by _ replication _ , whereby each @xmath36 is replaced by @xmath37 vertices forming a strong clique , so that if @xmath16 is an arc in @xmath35 , then all @xmath38 vertices replacing @xmath39 dominate ( i.e. , have arcs to ) in @xmath2 all @xmath40 vertices replacing @xmath41 . note that all @xmath40 vertices replacing @xmath41 have exactly the same in- and out - neighbours in @xmath2 ( except that each of them does not dominate itself ) .",
    "note that the strong components of a transitive digraph @xmath2 are strong cliques .",
    "a strong component of @xmath2 is called _ initial _ if the corresponding vertex @xmath41 of @xmath35 is a source ( indegree zero vertex ) .",
    "also note that if @xmath2 is a semi - complete transitive digraph , then @xmath35 is a transitive tournament .    a _ digon _ is a pair of arcs @xmath42 .",
    "many homomorphism problems are easy when restricted to transitive input digraphs ; we often get only finitely many transitive minimal @xmath1-obstructions .",
    "suppose , for instance , that @xmath1 is a _",
    "symmetric digraph _",
    ", i.e. , each arc is in a digon . in other words , @xmath1 is obtained from a graph @xmath43 by replacing each edge of @xmath43 by a digon .",
    "let @xmath1 be a symmetric digraph , and let @xmath12 be the size of a largest strong clique in @xmath1 .",
    "then all transitive minimal @xmath1-obstructions have @xmath44 vertices .",
    "since @xmath1 is symmetric , @xmath2 is @xmath1-colourable if and only if the underlying graph @xmath45 of @xmath2 is @xmath43-colourable . since @xmath45 is a comparability graph , and hence is perfect , it admits a @xmath46-colouring , where @xmath46 is size of the largest clique in @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath45 admits a homomorphism to @xmath47 , and contains a copy of @xmath47",
    ". therefore @xmath45 is @xmath43-colourable if and only if @xmath48 , and hence all minimal transitive @xmath1-obstructions are semi - complete digraphs with @xmath44 vertices",
    ".    on the other hand , consider the case when @xmath1 is an asymmetric digraph ( i.e. , has no digons ) .",
    "in this case we also have only finitely many transitive minimal @xmath1-obstructions .",
    "let @xmath1 be an asymmetric digraph , and let @xmath12 be the size of a largest transitive tournament in @xmath1 .",
    "then the only transitive minimal @xmath1-obstructions are the digon and the transitive tournament on @xmath44 vertices .",
    "obviously the digon and the transitive tournament on @xmath44 vertices are transitive minimal @xmath1-obstructions .",
    "if @xmath2 does not contain a digon , it is an asymmetric transitive digraph . as noted earlier , the reflexive closure of @xmath2 is a partial order . by dilworth s theorem ,",
    "the vertices of @xmath2 can be covered by @xmath46 independent sets where @xmath46 is the maximum length of a chain in this order .",
    "therefore , the only other minimal obstruction is the transitive tournament on @xmath44 vertices , where @xmath12 is the size of the largest transitive tournament in @xmath1 .",
    "it follows from the previous two propositions that when @xmath1 is a symmetric , or an asymmetric , digraph , the @xmath1-colouring problem restricted to transitive digraphs is polynomial time solvable . as we will see later ( corollary [ there ] ) , the same is not expected for the case when @xmath1 is transitive .",
    "however , when @xmath1 is transitive and also semi - complete , we do get a polynomial time algorithm and a finite set of minimal @xmath1-obstructions .",
    "[ semic ] suppose @xmath1 is a semi - complete transitive digraph .",
    "a transitive digraph @xmath2 is homomorphic to @xmath1 if and only if every semi - complete subgraph of @xmath2 is homomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "as noted above , @xmath1 is obtained by replication from a transitive tournament @xmath49 , and @xmath2 by replication from a transitive acyclic digraph @xmath35 . each maximal chain in @xmath35",
    "yields a semi - complete subgraph @xmath50 of @xmath2 .",
    "we prove the theorem by induction on the number of vertices of @xmath1 .",
    "assume we have a semi - complete transitive digraph @xmath1 and a transitive digraph @xmath2 such that each semi - complete subgraph of @xmath2 admits a homomorphism to @xmath1 .",
    "note that @xmath1 has a unique initial strong component , say @xmath51 , with @xmath27 vertices .",
    "let @xmath45 be obtained from @xmath2 by removing one vertex from each initial strong component @xmath52 which has @xmath53 vertices .",
    "let @xmath43 be obtained from @xmath1 by removing one vertex @xmath54 from the unique initial strong component @xmath51 .",
    "clearly , @xmath43 is a semi - complete transitive digraph , and @xmath45 a transitive digraph ; we claim that each semi - complete subgraph of @xmath45 is homomorphic to @xmath43 . indeed , suppose @xmath50 is a semi - complete subgraph of @xmath45 . since @xmath50 admits a homomorphism @xmath7 to @xmath1 , @xmath7 is also a homomorphism to @xmath43 unless it takes some @xmath55 to @xmath54 .",
    "it is easy to see that this implies that @xmath50 intersects one of the initial strong components of size @xmath56 . since",
    "a vertex was removed from this component , we have @xmath50 homomorphic to @xmath43 . by induction",
    "@xmath45 admits a homomorphism to @xmath43 and so @xmath2 admits a homomorphism to @xmath1 .",
    "( note that @xmath54 dominates all vertices of @xmath1 . )",
    "if @xmath1 is a semi - complete transitive digraph with @xmath12 vertices , then all the minimal transitive obstructions are semi - complete digraphs with at most @xmath44 vertices .",
    "we show below that we need @xmath1 to be both transitive and semi - complete to have finite number of minimal transitive obstructions .    up to this point",
    ", we have always seen polynomial algorithms and finite sets of minimal obstructions go hand in hand , for transitive inputs .",
    "there are nevertheless digraphs @xmath1 that have infinitely many transitive minimal obstructions , but can be solved in polynomial time for transitive inputs .    ]",
    "the digraph @xmath1 in figure [ digh ] has infinitely many minimal @xmath1-obstructions .    however , the @xmath1-colouring problem is polynomial - time solvable .",
    "-obstructions ]    all the digraphs in figure [ inffam ] are easily checked to be transitive minimal @xmath1-obstructions .",
    "we show that the @xmath1-colouring problem can be solved in polynomial time , by reduction to 2-sat .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 has no strong clique of size three or semi - complete digraph of size four , otherwise @xmath2 is definitely not @xmath1-colourable .",
    "moreover , we may assume that @xmath2 has no isolated vertices .",
    "now each strong component has at most two vertices .",
    "we remove one vertex from each digon , obtaining an acyclic transitive digraph @xmath45 , in which each vertex is either a source ( in - degree zero ) , or a sink ( out - degree zero ) , or an `` intermediate '' vertex , i.e. , a vertex with at least one in - neighhbour and at least one out - neighbour ( where all the in - neighbours are sources and all out - neighbours are sinks ) .",
    "note that the absence of semi - complete digraphs of size four implies that no `` intermediate '' vertex is the result of a digon contraction , and there are no arcs between two `` intermediate '' vertices .",
    "we associate a variable @xmath57 with each source and sink @xmath58 in @xmath45 . the intended meaning for @xmath59 will be that @xmath58 maps to @xmath27 or @xmath60 , and @xmath61 will mean @xmath58 maps to @xmath62 if @xmath58 is a sink , and maps to @xmath63 if @xmath58 is a source . with this in mind",
    ", we set up a constraint for each arc @xmath5 in @xmath45 where @xmath9 is a source and @xmath54 is a sink as follows .    *",
    "if @xmath58 is a contracted digon , then we add the constraint @xmath59 . *",
    "if neither @xmath9 nor @xmath54 is a contracted digon then we add the constraint @xmath64 . *",
    "if there is an `` intermediate '' vertex @xmath58 that dominates @xmath54 and is dominated by @xmath9 , in the original digraph @xmath2 , then we add the constraint @xmath65 .",
    "note that the third condition implies that if one of @xmath66 is a contracted digon , then the variable of the other vertex obtains the value @xmath67 .    if @xmath2 is homomorphic to @xmath1 , then so is @xmath45 , and setting the variable values as suggested by their intended meaning will clearly satisfy all constraints . on the other hand",
    ", if we have a satisfying assignment , we may define a homomorphism of @xmath2 to @xmath1 as follows .",
    "any vertex @xmath58 with @xmath61 will map to @xmath62 if it is a sink and to @xmath63 if it is a source .",
    "it is easy to see that the set of vertices @xmath58 that are either `` intermediate '' vertices or have @xmath59 induces a bipartite subgraph of @xmath2 ( because of the third set of constraints ) .",
    "therefore all the remaining vertices can be mapped to the digon @xmath28 .",
    "the minimal obstructions to 2-sat are well understood @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to conclude from these that all the minimal obstructions for this digraph @xmath1 are , in addition to the strong clique with three vertices and all transitive semi - complete digraphs on four vertices ( not containing a strong clique on three vertices ) , only digraphs containing as spanning subgraphs the digraphs in figure [ inffam ] .",
    "we note that the same infinite family in figure [ inffam ] is also a family of minimal @xmath68-obstructions for the semi - complete digraph @xmath68 obtained from @xmath1 by adding the arc @xmath69 .",
    "this shows that we can not weaken proposition [ semic ] by removing the assumption that @xmath1 is transitive .",
    "( corollary [ there ] below shows that we can not remove the other assumption , that @xmath1 be semi - complete . )",
    "next we note that there are many digraphs @xmath1 that yield np - complete @xmath1-colouring problem even when restricted to transitive digraphs .",
    "we consider the following construction .",
    "let @xmath1 be a bipartite graph with at most @xmath70 black and at most @xmath70 white vertices .",
    "we form the digraph @xmath43 as follows .",

    "let @xmath74 also be a directed path with @xmath72 vertices , in which the the last , and the @xmath75-st , vertex have been duplicated .",
    "we identify the last vertex of each @xmath71 with the @xmath39-th white vertex ( if any ) of @xmath1 and the first vertex of each @xmath74 with the @xmath39-th black vertex ( if any ) of @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath43 is obtained from the resulting digraph by taking the transitive closure .",
    "it is easy to see that the added paths ensure that the only homomorphism of @xmath43 to itself is the identity .",

    "suppose @xmath2 is an instance of the @xmath1-retraction problem , i.e. , a bipartite graph containing @xmath1 as a subgraph with lists @xmath80 for each ( black and white ) vertex @xmath62 of @xmath1 , and lists @xmath81 for all other ( black and white ) vertices of @xmath2 .",
    "we construct an instance @xmath45 of the @xmath43-colouring problem by orienting all edges of @xmath2 from the white vertices to the black vertices , attaching paths @xmath71 and @xmath82 to the vertices of @xmath1 as in the construction of @xmath43 , and then ( for the vertices not in @xmath1 ) we identify the last vertex of a ( separate ) copy of @xmath76 to each white vertex of @xmath2 not in @xmath1 , and identify the first vertex of a ( separate ) copy of @xmath77 to each black vertex of @xmath2 not in @xmath1 , and finally we take a transitive closure . now it is easy to see that each homomorphism of @xmath45 to @xmath43 preserves the level of vertices , and that @xmath45 admits an @xmath43-colouring if and only if @xmath2 admits a retraction to @xmath1 .",
    "we now observe that the construction of @xmath43 ensures that it is itself transitive .",

    "( if we view all arcs of a digraph to be weak arcs of a trigraph , we obtain the same problem . ) in the next section , we shall see that more general matrix partition problems exhibit behaviour as complex as any constraint satisfaction problem .",
    "one of the foremost open problems in this area is the conjecture of feder and vardi , which asserts that for each relational structure @xmath1 ( as defined above ) the constraint satisfaction problem to @xmath1 is polynomial time solvable or np - complete @xcite .",
