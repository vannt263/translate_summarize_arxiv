    "the number of exactly solvable problems in non - relativistic quantum mechanics is small , and most of them can be dealt with the factorization method .",
    "this technique , introduced long ago by schrdinger @xcite , was analyzed in depth by infeld and hull @xcite , who made an exhaustive classification of factorizable potentials .",
    "later on , witten noticed the possibility of arranging the schrdinger s hamiltonians into isospectral pairs ( supersymmetric partners ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting _ supersymmetric quantum mechanics _ ( susy qm ) revived the study of exactly solvable hamiltonians ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an additional step was mielnik s factorization through which the general susy partner for the oscillator for a certain factorization energy was found @xcite ; this technique was immediately applied to the hydrogen potential @xcite .",
    "meanwhile nieto @xcite , andrianov _ et al _ @xcite and sukumar @xcite put the method on its natural background discovering the links between susy , factorization and darboux algorithm , causing then a renaissance of the related algebraic methods @xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these procedures can be recovered from a general setting in which a first - order differential operator intertwines two hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "this so - called first - order intertwining technique suggests further generalizations : the most obvious one involves a @xmath0-th order differential intertwining operator and gives place to the higher - order supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( h - susy qm ) @xcite .",
    "it can be achieved by iterations of first order susy transformations @xcite .",
    "an alternative to deal with the problem consists in looking for the @xmath0-th order operator directly , expressing the intertwiner as a sum of the @xmath1 terms @xmath2 , and solving the system of equations resulting from the intertwining relationship for the @xmath3 s . by assuming that the initial hamiltonian is solvable",
    ", new solvable ones and their eigenstates can be generated through the two previous formulations .",
    "concerning applications , the procedure works successfully to generate @xmath0-parametric families of potentials almost isospectral to the harmonic oscillator @xcite , the radial hydrogen - like potentials @xcite , and in the free particle case @xcite ( for a collection of recent papers on susy qm see @xcite ) .",
    "specially interesting are the susy partners of the oscillator because through them some connections with other important subjects of mathematical physics can be established .    in the first place let us notice the existence of differential annihilation and creation operators of order greater than one for the susy partners of the oscillator .",
    "these operators provide natural realizations of the so called polynomial heisenberg algebras @xcite . it is interesting as well that these non - linear algebras admit partial linearizations @xcite , i.e.",
    ", through appropriate modifications on the ladder operators the standard heisenberg algebra is recovered on the subspace spanned by the eigenfunctions intertwined with the physical eigenstates of the oscillator .    in the second place",
    "let us mention the construction of coherent states ( cs ) for potentials generated through the intertwining technique @xcite",
    ". in this direction fukui and aizawa have derived some cs for the ` shape invariant ' potentials @xcite , a particular class of solvable potentials generated long ago by infeld and hull through the factorization method @xcite .",
    "the first work involving cs for the simplest non - trivial family of potentials isospectral to the oscillator ( abraham - moses @xcite ) was done in 1994 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . later on various developments have appeared , e.g. , some authors have constructed the cs for a class of anharmonic oscillators which spectra consist of a part isospectral to the oscillator plus one lower energy at a multiple of the spacing between the oscillator levels @xcite .",
    "furthermore , cs have been derived @xcite for families of susy partner potentials having an arbitrary eigenvalue below the ground state energy of the oscillator @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been implemented as well the cs construction for the general h - susy partners of the oscillator @xcite .    in these lecture notes",
    "we are going to address the subjects mentioned above .",
    "we will start with the iterative h - susy qm to generate families of potentials ( almost ) isospectral to the initial one .",
    "then , we will formulate the same problem directly , by assuming that the intertwining operator is of @xmath0-th order . due to the difficulty involved in this problem , we just will illustrate the technique through the second - order supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "then we will apply these generation procedures to the harmonic oscillator .",
    "it will be shown that the intrinsic symmetry of the h - susy partners of the oscillator is generated by a pair of differential annihilation and creation operators of order greater than one , giving place to explicit representations of the polynomial heisenberg algebras .",
    "we will show as well an interesting linearization procedure for the nonlinear algebras characteristic of the h - susy partners of the oscillator .",
    "we will perform then the coherent states construction in the non - linear as well as in the linear cases .",
    "we will conclude these notes with some discussion on the future of susy qm .",
    "let us start with two schrdinger hamiltonians @xmath4 and suppose the existence of a first order differential operator @xmath5 intertwining them @xmath6 where @xmath7 the superpotential @xmath8 being a real function to be determined .",
    "in order to ` pass ' the differential operator @xmath9 and its powers to the right in the terms arising from ( [ intertwining1 ] ) , we use the following operator relationships @xmath10 & & \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f = f\\frac{d^2}{dx^2 } + 2 f'\\frac{d}{dx } + f ''   \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , it is straightforward to show that @xmath11 due to ( [ intertwining1 ] ) we make equal the coefficient of the same powers of @xmath9 of the two previous equations to obtain @xmath12 substituting the expression for @xmath13 of ( [ nv ] ) in ( [ riccatiprime ] ) and integrating the result we get : @xmath14 from now on we are going to express explicitly the dependence of the superpotential in terms of the _ factorization energy _",

    "we shall suppose as well that , for fixed @xmath37 , the arbitrary parameter of a general riccati solution ( [ riccati1 ] ) has been adjusted in order to avoid the singularities in the @xmath41 s .",

    "indeed , with this ordering of @xmath37 and @xmath44 the right choice is to take @xmath177 nodeless and @xmath178 having one zero at @xmath179 , i.e. , @xmath180 .",
    "since @xmath181 , it turns out that @xmath155 has one critical point at @xmath179 .",

    "the spectrum of the new hamiltonian is @xmath183 ( see a potential @xmath42 with this kind of spectrum in figure 1 ) .",
    "notice that this case coincides with the one typically discussed when the second - order transformation is achieved through the iteration of two first - order transformations .",
    "* if we choose @xmath184 , our heuristic criterion suggests that perhaps we can find @xmath177 and @xmath178 such that @xmath155 is nodeless and @xmath158 , @xmath159 are normalizable @xcite .",
    "we would get then that @xmath185 ( see figure 2 ) .",

    "this means that the confluent second - order susy transformations allow the embedding of _ single _ energy levels above the ground state energy of @xmath21 ( see figure 3 ) . in addition",
    ", the physical solutions associated to the excited state levels of @xmath21 can be used as well as transformation functions , no matter the number of zeros they have in the domain of @xmath25 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "these two features can not be achieved by iterating the first - order susy transformations without paying the price of introducing singularities at the intermediate potentials .",
    "as expected , these atypical spectral possibilities are consistent with our heuristic criterion previously formulated .      if @xmath143 we have that @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "notice that our heuristic criterion allows this possibility without violating the positive nature of the operator @xmath244 .",

    "following analogous steps as for the real case , one arrives to the solution @xmath124 of ( [ 2.33 ] ) in terms of the ( complex ) solution @xmath146 of the riccati equation ( [ 2.40 ] ) associated to @xmath37 @xcite ( for the case when @xmath42 is allowed to be complex see @xcite ) : @xmath246}\\ ] ] using the corresponding complex schrdinger solution @xmath29 we can write @xmath247    in order to avoid the creation of singularities in @xmath248 , @xmath230 must be nodeless . since @xmath249 , it turns out that @xmath230 is a non - decreasing monotonic function .",

    "we have seen that the standard iterative method , in which the first - order susy transformations are used to construct higher - order ones , could induce the wrong conclusion that the new hamiltonians will have always the new levels below the ground state energy of the initial one . here , it has been shown that the direct procedure frees us of that belief , allowing to create under certain restrictions some new levels above the initial ground state energy .",
    "it is important to underline also the complex susy transformations which can be employed to generate non - hermitian hamiltonians with either purely real spectra or with some finite number of complex levels @xcite .",
    "we think that this interesting line of research is worth to be continued .",
    "when the susy techniques are applied to the harmonic oscillator , some interrelations immediately arise with several subjects of mathematical physics as non - linear deformations of lie algebras and coherent states @xcite . it can be established also connections between susy techniques and non - linear ordinary differential equations as riccati @xcite , painlev @xcite and kdv @xcite .",
    "in particular , when looking for the general systems ruled by second - order polynomial heisenberg algebras , it turns out that the corresponding potentials become determined by a certain function which obeys the painlev iv equation @xcite .",
    "it has been recently shown that subsets of h - susy partner hamiltonians of the oscillator for which the @xmath0 levels @xmath510 are forced to be connected by appropriate annihilation and creation operators to form a finite ladder of equally spaced levels , supply us with explicit solutions of the painlev iv equations @xcite .",
    "notice that a similar treatment relates subsets of susy partner potentials of the radial oscillator and solutions of the painlev v equation @xcite .",
    "we conclude by mentioning that links of this kind between susy techniques and non - linear aspects of mathematical - physics , as the ones previously pointed out , represent the future of a field which has proved very fruitful along the years ( see e.g. @xcite ) ."
