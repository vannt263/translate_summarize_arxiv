    "many experiments were performed to find clues regarding mechanism of high-@xmath11 superconductivity and the nature of the superconducting pair wave function . notwithstanding this effort",
    "the nature of the orbital symmetry of the order parameter is not yet known completely after a decayed of its discovery although strong evidence of a major @xmath2 symmetry exists @xcite .",
    "phase and node sensitive experiments also reported a sign reversal of the order parameter supporting @xmath5 wave symmetry @xcite .",
    "the most current scenario as appears from various experiments and theory that the pairing symmetry of these family could be a mixed one like @xmath12 where @xmath13 could be something in the @xmath7 wave family or @xmath14 .",
    "the electron doped @xmath15 superconductors are however pure @xmath7 wave like @xcite .",
    "tunneling experiments had questioned the pure d - wave symmetry@xcite as the data were interpreted as an admixture of d and s - wave components due to orthorhombicity in ybco@xcite .",
    "possibility of a minor but finite @xmath16 symmetry alongwith the predominant @xmath8 has also been suggested@xcite in connection with magnetic defects or small fractions of a flux quantum @xmath17 in ybco powders .",
    "similar proposals came from various other authors in the context of magnetic field , magnetic impurity , interface effect etc .",
    "@xcite these proposals got the correct momentum when experimental data on longitudinal thermal conductivity by krishana _",
    "@xcite of @xmath18 compounds and that by movshovich _ et al , _",
    "@xcite showed supportive indication to such proposals .",
    "there are experimental results related to interface effects as well as in the bulk that indicates mixed pairing symmetry ( with dominant @xmath5-wave ) @xcite , thus providing a strong threat to the pure @xmath5 wave models .    in this paper",
    "our main aim is to study the possibility of a mixed pairing symmetry state with @xmath19 where @xmath20 for @xmath21 with both @xmath5 and @xmath7 on an equal footing .",
    "we show that @xmath8 can mix with @xmath22 in the tetragonal group for @xmath6 but not for @xmath23 .",
    "the phase of the second condensate state is thus extremely important .",
    "we then show that eventhough the _ lowest order _",
    "@xmath8 can not mix with @xmath24 , the corresponding _ higher order _ symmetries can mix freely with each other . by _",
    "lowest order _ we mean the usual @xmath5-wave ( _ i.e _ , simple @xmath25 form ) , extended @xmath7 wave ( _ i.e _ , simple @xmath26 form ) and so on . by",
    "_ higher order _ we mean such symmetries with higher harmonics present in it , like @xmath27 form where @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) or even more complicated like @xmath30 and so on",
    ". this will be clearer as we proceed .",
    "now , in order to obtain such pairing symmetry in the respective channels one needs effective attractive pairing potential @xmath31 .",
    "we derive , in the spirit of tight binding longer range attraction than the usual nearest ( or next nearest ) neighbour one such interaction potential .",
    "the potential @xmath31 therefore , changes the position of its minimum from that of the usual @xmath5 or @xmath7 wave cases for @xmath32 .",
    "we show , depending on the position of the pair potential or in other words , longer ranged attractions @xmath33 etc .",
    "the dominant symmetry changes from @xmath8 for @xmath34 to @xmath7 like otherwise .",
    "this study can particularly be justified based on the following grounds .",
    "( _ i _ ) on general grounds , long range interaction arise from a decrease in screening as one approaches the insulator .",
    "in specific models of superconductivity like the spin - fluctuation mediated models , an increase in the antiferromagnetic correlation length occurs with underdoping .",
    "( _ ii _ ) one of the potential theories of high temperature superconductivity that favors @xmath5 wave symmetry is the spin fluctuation theory @xcite .",
    "the gap symmetry of the spin fluctuation theory is however not the _ simplest _ @xmath5-wave but _ higher order _ @xmath5-wave , approximately of the form @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "explicit @xmath36-anisotrpy of the gap in spin fluctuation mediated superconductivity was obtained by lenck and carbotte @xcite in bcs theory with the phenomenological spin susceptibility as pairing interaction using fast - fourier - transform technique , without any prior assumption about the symmetry of the gap .",
    "they concluded , the gap although have nodal lines along @xmath37 , _ does not _ have the simplest @xmath5-wave symmetry but rather _ higher order _ @xmath5 wave symmetry with higher harmonics present in it .",
    "therfore , this work provide a real space derivation of a pair potential that produces higher order @xmath5-wave symmetry similar to that present in the spin fluctuation theory . ( _ iii _ ) in the magnetic scenario of the cuprates @xcite , one can set @xmath9 equal to the magnetic coherence length which is larger than the lattice spacing @xcite .",
    "the coherence length in the superconducting state which is different for different materials may be because a short range interaction requires larger densities than a long range one in order to produce coherent motion that leads to superconductivity .",
    "( the @xmath38 relationship is not unique in all high @xmath11 systems , some starts to superconduct with very small doping , @xmath39 whereas some systems require larger @xmath39 ) .",
    "( _ iv _ ) the high @xmath11 systems are in very complicated circuit and the electronic correlation effects may not be adequately accounted unless one considers next nearest or further neighbour repulsion .",
    "therefore , in the spirit of tight binding lattice the effective attraction may only arise with more distant attractive interation .",
    "( _ v _ ) in a most recent angel resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiment by a well known group @xcite , such requirement of long range interaction was realized .",
    "one of their essential findings is , as the doping decreases , the maximum gap increases , but the slope of the gap near the nodes decreases .",
    "this particular feature although consistent with @xmath5 wave but can not be fit by simple @xmath40 but requires a finite mixing of @xmath41 as well , where @xmath42 is angle between @xmath43 given as , @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath41 contains higher harmonics than simple @xmath45 .",
    "rest of the lay out of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we derive the pair potential required for higher anisotropic @xmath5 and extended @xmath7 wave symmetries .",
    "we also provide a brief prescription of finding coupled gap equations for the amplitudes of such higher anisotropic symmetries .",
    "in section iii , we present and discuss in details all the numerical results providing strong signature of change in dominant pairing symmetry with range of interation .",
    "finally , we conlude in section iv .",
    "let us consider that the overlap of orbitals in different unit cells is small compared to the diagonal overlap .",
    "then in the spirit of tight binding lattice description , the matrix element of the pair potential may be obtained as , @xmath46 where in the first result of the equation  ( [ ppot ] ) @xmath47 locates nearest neighbour and further neighbours , @xmath48 labels and @xmath49 , @xmath50 represents strength of attraction between the respective neighbour interaction . the first term in the above equation @xmath51 refers to the on - site interaction which is considered as repulsive but can be attractive as well giving rise isotropic @xmath7 wave . in this paper , we shall not consider the isotropic @xmath7 wave for a mixed symmetry with @xmath5 wave ( cf .",
    "the form factors of the potential are obtained as , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 leads to usual @xmath8 , @xmath24 pairing symmetry for @xmath55 and unusual or higher order @xmath8 , @xmath24 pairing symmetry respectively which results from interations along the @xmath39 and @xmath56 axes ( _ i.e _ , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 neighbour interaction ) . while the usual and higher order @xmath14 , @xmath22 pairing symmetry results from @xmath60 , @xmath61 , the @xmath62 neighbour interaction gives rise to unconventional @xmath5 and extended @xmath7-wave pairing symmetry through @xmath63 and @xmath64 given in equation ( 2 ) . in deriving eqs .",
    "( [ ppot],2 ) terms responsible for triplet pairing which are not important for high @xmath11 systems are neglected .",
    "we shall discuss now the mixed phase symmetry of @xmath8 with other symmetries taking two of the potential terms at a time , namely , a combination of potential terms in  ( [ ppot ] ) ( @xmath65 ) , ( @xmath66 ) , ( @xmath67 ) gives rise to pairing symmetry @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the lattice constant and will be taken as unity .",

    "( [ gapcomp ] ) between the strengths of pairing interaction channels through out . in figures 1 and 2 we present results for @xmath93 symmetries for @xmath94 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "such symmetries would arise from a combination of two component pair potentials ( @xmath95 ) , ( @xmath96 ) , ( @xmath97 ) and so on .",
    "we shall discuss only the results of @xmath6 and @xmath23 .",
    "these two phases of @xmath98 can cause important differences ( cf . figures 3 , 4 ) .",
    "it is known that for any @xmath99 , time reversal symmetry is locally broken @xcite which correspond to a phase transition to an _ almost _ fully gapped phase ( except at the points @xmath100 due to common nodal points from both the channels ) from a partially ungapped phase of @xmath8 symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath101 phase still remains nodeful , although the nodal lines shifts a lot from the usual @xmath102 lines of the @xmath8 .",
    "= 4.5truein = 4.5truein    the solid lines represent the amplitude of @xmath8 channel whereas the dashed lines indicate that of @xmath24 . these figures (",

    "in fact , as the interaction becomes longer ranged ( _ i.e _ , @xmath104 as is demonstrated in figures 1 , 2 * ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) * respectively ) the dominant symmetry changes drastically ; as the typical length @xmath9 is odd multiple of the lattice constant , the dominant symmetry at lower doping is @xmath8 like whereas when the @xmath9 is even multiple of the lattice constant , the dominant symmetry at lower doping is something in the @xmath7-wave family ( see also figures 3 , 4 ) .",

    "these phase diagrams ( figures 1,2,3,4 ) drawn at t = 1 mk does not change the scenario even for @xmath6 , in the mixed phase of @xmath5-wave with @xmath24 symmetry but causes significant change for that with @xmath22 symmetry ( cf .",
    "fig.4 ) . more significantly",
    ", the case of @xmath106 is universal ( _ i.e _ , independent of @xmath98 and @xmath24 or @xmath22 mixing with @xmath5 -wave ) , the dominant symmetry at zero temperature is @xmath7-wave type .",
    "this work therefore , has revealed in a significant way the change in predominant pairing symmetry as the interaction range is changed at t=0 .",
    "it is to be noted that in contrast to hole doped material , the electron doped materials ( like @xmath15 ) have no signature of dominant @xmath5-wave symmetry .",
    "furthermore , the antiferromagnetic phase in the electron doped systems is more extended or exists till larger doping in comparison to the hole doped material .",
    "therefore , considering models related to spin fluctuation mediated superconductivity , the longer range attraction should be more important . in the present picture",
    ", we showed that such longer range interaction cause change in the pairing symmetry which might make this study to have imporatant bearings for the high-@xmath11 compunds .",
    "= 4.5truein = 4.5truein    some interesting features of the data presented is that optimal doping remains unchanged irrespective of @xmath9 that causes a significant _ crossover _ in the dominant symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "the position of the @xmath5-wave does not change appreciably except the case of @xmath110 while the extended @xmath7 wave region moves drastically with @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath111 , the extended @xmath7 wave family has finite amplitude only at densities close to zero ( @xmath112 ) ( cf .",

    "the @xmath5-wave regains its poisition although both the amplitude and width decreases to about @xmath116 to that of the @xmath114 case and the @xmath7-wave shifts towards larger doping having its amplitude minimum at the maximum of @xmath5-wave . for @xmath110",
    "the extended @xmath7-wave dominates and the @xmath5-wave either becomes a minor component or does not appear at all .",
    "furthermore , in the optimal doping whichever symmetry dominates causes the amplitude of the other minimum _ i.e _ , the dominant symmetry always expels the other one at the optimum doping .",

    "fig.4 represents phase diagram of superconductors having mixed phase symmetry like @xmath117 with @xmath6 ( the case of @xmath94 is discussed in fig.3 and should be contrasted with fig.4 ) .",
    "the phase diagram comprises the amplitudes of the respective symmetry channels as a function band filling @xmath118 . in striking contrast to all the figures fig.1 , fig.2 and fig.3 , there is strong mixing of @xmath8 with @xmath22 for @xmath119 .",
    "= 4.5truein = 4.5truein    in fact mixing between the two symmetries is so strong that it is difficult to find out the predominant symmetry for the cases @xmath120 . in this mixed symmetry , for @xmath23 and @xmath110 ( cf .",
    "3(d ) ) , the @xmath5-wave amplitude is practically zero whereas for @xmath121 ( cf .",

    "this is the only mixed phase where both of the symmetries at optimal doping has large values ( see figs 4(a ) , ( c ) ) unlike those in figures 1 to figures 3 .",
    "the results of this figure thus convincingly points out the role of the phase between the two mixing symmetries .",
    "all the experimentally observed properties of cuprates will be consistent with the scenario of fig .",
    "4 , including the sign change of the order parameter as well as gap nodes .",
    "the strong interplay between the two order parameters of mixed @xmath122 symmetry has also been reflected in their thermal behaviors ( cf .",
    "fig . 5 ) . in figures 5 and 6",
    "we display the temperature dependencies of the amplitudes ( in ev ) of different symmetry order parameters for @xmath115 as maximum mixing is found in    = 4.5truein = 4.5truein    this case .",

    "5(a ) ) the amplitude of the @xmath22 component is suppressed with the onset of the @xmath5-wave component .",
    "however , when the bulk @xmath11 is determined by the @xmath5-wave , the amplitude of the @xmath5-wave is not affected by the onset of the @xmath22 component .",
    "this behavior is indeed new . in a study of mixed phase with usual @xmath124 phase with @xmath7 as isotropic @xmath7-wave",
    ", it was shown earlier @xcite that the @xmath5-wave component gets suppressed with the onset of @xmath7-wave but not the reverse .",
    "in contrast to fig . 5 , the temperature dependencies of the amplitudes of the @xmath5 and @xmath24 symmetries remain unaffected by each other as displayed in figure 6 . in general",
    ", however , the growth of the amplitudes of different symmetries with lowering in temperature is faster in case of @xmath6 than that for @xmath94 .",
    "this once again emphasize the role of the phase @xmath98 .",
    "temperature dependencies for other values of @xmath125 is qualitatively same as those shown in figures 5 and 6 .",
    "= 3.5truein = 3.5truein    so far we have discussed the interplay of order parameters in mixed phases like @xmath126 , @xmath127 or @xmath128 .",

    "simultaneously no mixing between these unconventional @xmath5 and @xmath7 wave symmetries was found . within the same parameter as in earlier figures ( _ i.e _ , @xmath139 )",
    ", @xmath5-wave remains very strong at lower dopings ( within the range @xmath140 ) whereas the @xmath7-wave amplitude appears very close to zero band filling .",
    "therefore , in fig .",
    "7 we present the momentum anisotropy of the unconventional @xmath5-wave gap originated from @xmath62 neighbour attraction .",
    "it is clear that gap anisotropy is undoubtedly very different form the _ usual _ nearest - neighbour @xmath5-wave symmetry , although basic features of change in sign , nodes etc . remains same as that of the ordinary @xmath5-wave .",
    "this gap symmetry at @xmath141 gives rise to a bcs gap ratio @xmath142 against 4.29 in case of _ usual _ @xmath5-wave .",
    "such higher anisotropic @xmath5 wave symmetries will have advantage of avoiding electronic repulsion in strongly correlated system like the cuprates .",
    "we have studied the superconducting phase with two component order parameter scenario , such as , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 .",
    "we showed , that in absence of orthorhombocity , the usual @xmath2 does not mix with usual @xmath3 symmetry gap in an anisotropic band structure .",

    "<S> the required pair potential to obtain _ higher anisotropic _ @xmath8 and extended @xmath7-wave symmetries , is derived by considering longer ranged two - body attractive potential in the spirit of tight binding lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the dominant pairing symmetry changes drastically from @xmath5 to @xmath7 like as the attractive pair potential is obtained from longer ranged interaction . more specifically , a typical length scale of interaction @xmath9 , which could be even / odd multiples of lattice spacing leads to predominant @xmath10 wave symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the role of long range interaction on pairing symmetry has further been emphasized by studying the typical interplay in the temperature dependencies of these higher order @xmath5 and @xmath7 wave pairing symmetries .    </S>",
