    "these results nicely fit in a view where star formation in bursts triggered by interaction / merging consumes and enriches the gas content of galaxies as time goes on .",
    "indeed , such a scenario is qualitatively predicted within the paradigm of hierarchical growth of structures in which galaxy formation is a continuous process .",
    "however , we have only a partial view on galaxy evolution since most of the observational data come from optical surveys which probe the rest  frame uv and visible emission of high@xmath1 galaxies .",
    "a still unknown fraction of star / galaxy formation is hidden by dust which absorbs uv / visible starlight and re  radiates at larger wavelengths . at low @xmath1",
    ", the iras satellite has discovered a sequence of ir properties , from `` normal spirals '' to the `` luminous ir galaxies '' ( hereafter lirgs ) , mostly interacting systems , and the spectacular `` ultraluminous ir galaxies '' ( hereafter ulirgs ) , which are mergers ( sanders and mirabel 1996 ) and emit more than 95 % of their energy in the ir .",
    "in contrast , we know very little about galaxy evolution at high @xmath1 in this wavelength range .",
    "faint galaxy counts with iras seem to show a strong luminosity and/or density evolution at @xmath7 , but it is difficult to extrapolate this trend to higher redshifts on a firm ground . the cosmic infrared background ( hereafter cirb ) detected by puget _",
    "( 1996 ) in firas residuals sets strong constraints on the presence of a population of ir / submm sources .",
    "we hereafter briefly review the observational case ( in sec .",
    "2 ) and use a semi - analytic modelling of galaxy formation and evolution to predict number counts ( in sec . 3 ) .",
    "the epoch of galaxy formation can be observed in the background radiation which is produced by the accumulation of the light of extragalactic sources along the line of sight .",
    "the search for the `` cosmic optical background '' currently gives only upper limits .",
    "the shallowing of the hdf faint counts suggests that we are now close to convergence and that an estimate of the cob can be obtained by summing up the contributions of faint galaxies ( williams _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) .    -1truecm    the re  analysis of cobe / firas residuals between 200 @xmath0 m and 2 mm has led puget _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) to discover the presence of an isotropic component which is likely to be the long  sought cirb .",
    "several steps are necessary in order to remove the foregound galactic components and extract the isotropic residual identified as the cirb . whereas , at the wavelengths probed by firas , the interplanetary emission is small and easily removed , the emission from interstellar dust mixed with the different gas phases of the interstellar medium is the dominant component . in order to address this problem , the original method of puget _",
    "_ was applied again by guiderdoni _",
    "( 1997a ) , but only in the cleanest regions with very low hi column densities ( @xmath8 atoms @xmath9 instead of @xmath10 atoms @xmath9 ) .",
    "in that case , the residual component totally dominates the emission , as shown in fig .",
    "2 shows that the cirb intensity per frequency decade @xmath11 w m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 near 300 @xmath0 m is a factor of 5 higher than the no  evolution prediction obtained by a simple extrapolation of the ir luminosities of local galaxies .",
    "such a detection yields the first `` post  iras '' constraint on the high@xmath1 evolution of galaxies in the ir / submm range , before the era of iso results .",
    "its level is comparable to the optical background estimated by summing up faint galaxy counts down to the deepest limit so far available which is given by the hubble deep field ( williams _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , and suggests that a significant fraction of the energy of young stars is absorbed by dust and released in the ir / submm .",
    "the dirbe instrument on cobe has given so far upper limits on the ir background at wavelengths between 2 and 300 @xmath0 m ( hauser 1995 ) .",
    "however schlegel _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) extract a uniform background radiation from dirbe observations at the levels @xmath14 w m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 at 240 @xmath0 m and @xmath15 w m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 at 140 @xmath0 m .",
    "at least the value at 240 @xmath0 m , where the foregrounds are less important , seems to be consistent with the estimate from firas . a more thorough analysis of the dirbe data is currently undertaken by the dirbe team .",
    "in order to analyse the current data and make predictions for forthcoming observations , we have chosen to model galaxy evolution by using the so  called `` semi ",
    "analytic '' approach which has been rather successful in reproducing the overall properties of galaxies in the optical range .",
    "we have elaborated an extension of this type of method to the ir / submm range .",

    "the strong episode of star formation at @xmath21 corresponds to the decrease of the gas density in the universe .",
    "the local luminosity densities in the uv , visible and ir are accommodated by all our evolutionary scenarios , though they predict high@xmath1 ir luminosity densities which are strongly different .",

    "_ 1997 ; open squares ) .",
    "the agreement of the predictions with the data seems good enough to suggest that these counts do probe the evolving population contributing to the cirb .",
    "the model shows that 15 % and 60 % of the cirb respectively at 175 @xmath0 m and 850 @xmath0 m are built up by objects brighter than the current limits of isophot and scuba deep fields .",
    "it is also possible to get predicted redshift distributions for these counts .",
    "the predicted median redshift of the iso  hdf is @xmath22 .",
    "it increases to @xmath3 for the deep isophot surveys , and to @xmath23 for scuba , even if the latter value seems to be very sensitive to the details of evolution .",
    "with iso and scuba , a new window is now open to deep extragalactic surveys .",
    "a large number of objects are expected from current models of galaxy evolution in the ir / submm .",
    "these models accommodate local ir data and follow the high  redshift evolution of the `` cosmic constraints '' ( that is , the comoving sfr , gas and uv / optical / nir luminosity densities ) , as well as the high level of the isotropic component in cobe residuals which is probably the cirb .",
    "the data seem to be consistent with a strong evolution .",
    "significant progress in resolution and/or sensitivity expected from forthcoming satellites such as wire , sirtf , and first will show the high  redshift counterparts of local ulirgs .",
