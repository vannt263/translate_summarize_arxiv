    "an su(2)@xmath4 -doublet higgs boson of mass of the order of hundred gev is an inevitable ingredient in the standard electroweak gauge model . in the grand unified theories ( gut s )",
    "@xcite one must require an extremely precise fine - tuning among various parameters in order to obtain the light doublet higgs boson .",
    "the situation is not improved much even if one assumes supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the necessity of the fine - tuning of parameters is regarded as a crucial drawback in the gut scenario , although the recent high - precision measurements on the gauge coupling constants have strongly supported the susy extension of the gut s @xcite .    in recent papers @xcite",
    "we have proposed a susy gauge theory based on su(3)@xmath0 @xmath3 u(1)@xmath0 with six flavors of quarks which interact strongly at the gut scale and shown that the dynamics of this theory produces a pair of massless higgs doublets .",
    "thus , we have a natural explanation for the presence of light higgs doublets at the electroweak scale in the susy - gut s .",
    "however , we have also found that the hyperquark condensation breaks the gut gauge group su(5)@xmath1 down to su(3)@xmath2 @xmath3 su(2)@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we need to introduce an extra u(1)@xmath0 to have the standard - model gauge group unbroken at the low energies @xcite .",
    "the presence of u(1)@xmath0 above the gut scale is nothing wrong phenomenologically , but it would be more interesting if we did not need to introduce the extra u(1)@xmath0 .    in this paper we show that introduction of a singlet field @xmath6 into the previous model solves the problem .",
    "namely , in this new model , the broken u(1)@xmath5 ( a subgroup of su(5)@xmath1 ) is restored by quantum mechanical effects and hence we do not need to introduce the extra u(1)@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we find a stable quantum vacuum corresponding to the desired symmetry breaking su(5)@xmath1 @xmath7 su(3)@xmath2 @xmath3 su(2)@xmath4 @xmath3 u(1)@xmath5 .",
    "we also show that there remains a pair of higgs doublets massless in this quantum vacuum .",
    "in addition to these higgs doublets , however , we have a pair of massless singlets which contributes to the renormalization - group flows of low - energy gauge coupling constants and affects the unification of gauge couplings at the gut scale .",
    "we also propose a simple solution to this problem , giving a sufficiently large mass to the singlet pair .",
    "let us consider a supersymmetric hypercolor su(3)@xmath0 gauge theory @xcite with 6 flavors of hyperquark chiral superfields @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath10 in the fundamental representations * 3 * and @xmath11 of su(3)@xmath0 , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath12 denotes flavor index and it runs from 1 to 6 .",
    "the first five @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 transform as @xmath16 and * 5 * , respectively , under the gut gauge group su(5)@xmath1 , while the last @xmath17 and @xmath18 are singlets of su(5)@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we introduce three kinds of su(3)@xmath0 -singlet chiral superfields , a pair of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath6 @xmath22 , which are * 5 * , @xmath16 , * 24 * @xmath23 * 1 * and * 1 * of su(5)@xmath1 .",
    "besides the gauge symmetry , su(3)@xmath0 @xmath3 su(5)@xmath1 , we impose a global u(1)@xmath24 symmetry @xcite",
    "@xmath25    with the above gauge and global symmetries , we have a superpotential @xmath26 here , we have omitted trilinear self - coupling terms , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , for simplicity , and the mass term , @xmath30 , has been absorbed into the @xmath31 field by shift of the trace part of @xmath31 . , instead of introducing the trace part of @xmath31 . for this case",
    ", one may also derive the same conclusion in the present paper . ] the terms , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , for example , are forbidden by the global u(1)@xmath24 .",
    "notice that the singlet @xmath6 is not assumed in the previous models @xcite . as we will see later",
    ", @xmath6 plays a crucial role on quantum mechanical restoration of the u(1)@xmath5 gauge symmetry in the present model .",
    "we first consider the following classical vacuum discussed in the previous analyses @xcite : @xmath35 with @xmath36 ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 here , the vacuum - expectation value of @xmath6 is undetermined since its potential is flat for @xmath39 . in this classical vacuum",
    "the gauge group is broken down as @xmath40 there is no unbroken u(1)@xmath5 , which is the main motivation to introduce an extra u(1)@xmath0 gauge symmetry in ref.@xcite .",
    "we now show that u(1)@xmath5 broken in the classical vacuum is restored in a quantum vacuum .",
    "let us investigate the quantum vacua which satisfy the following conditions : ( i ) the vacuum - expectation values of @xmath31 have a diagonal form with those of @xmath41 and @xmath42 vanishing , and ( ii ) at least two hyperquarks among @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath43 are massive in the vacua so that we can integrate out them to get a susy qcd - like theory with the effective @xmath44 flavors .",
    "we identify the two massive hyperquarks with @xmath45 and @xmath14 @xmath46 .",
    "these quantum vacua include the vacuum defined in eq.([classicalvacuum ] ) in the classical limit .",
    "we analyze the vacua in a similar way taken in ref.@xcite .",
    "the integration of massive hyperquarks , @xmath45 and @xmath14 @xmath46 , leads to a low - energy effective theory with a superpotential @xmath47 where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the masses for the first and second hyperquarks , respectively . , which is confirmed in view of the following analysis . ] here , @xmath21 @xmath51 are decoupled from this low - energy superpotential and we have omitted @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xmath54 since they are irrelevant for our analysis .",
    "the effective superpotential which incorporates the strong su(3)@xmath0 dynamics is described by meson @xmath55 and baryon @xmath56 , @xmath57 chiral superfields @xcite @xmath58 as follows : @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes a dynamical scale of the low - energy su(3)@xmath0 interactions , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "has , of course , su(3)@xmath0 gauge anomalies and it is broken by the nonperturbative effects . however , the effective superpotential @xmath63 in eq.([weff ] ) except the dynamical part @xmath64 respects the u(1)@xmath24 symmetry as noted in ref.@xcite . ]    for @xmath65 , we can see that @xmath66 and @xmath67 necessarily have non - vanishing vacuum - expectation values leading to the breaking of u(1)@xmath5 as in the classical vacuum in eq.([classicalvacuum ] ) . however , there is a desired supersymmetric vacuum where @xmath68 ^ 3 \\ , , \\\\",
    "\\noalign{\\vskip 0.5ex }    ( i = 3 , \\cdots , 6 \\ ; { \\rm and } \\ ; a , b = 3 , \\cdots , 5 ) \\ , . \\end{array}\\ ] ] notice that in this vacuum the sixth hyperquark has an effective mass @xmath69 while other three hyperquarks are massless .",
    "therefore , our model becomes a susy qcd - like theory with @xmath70 massless quarks .",
    "the quantum vacuum in eq.([quantumvacuum ] ) is not the same as the classical one , which is consistent with the result obtained by seiberg @xcite for the case of @xmath71 , with @xmath72 being the number of colors .    with @xmath73",
    "we find that the higgs doublets @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath46 remain massless in this quantum vacuum @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , their color partners @xmath74 and @xmath75 have gut - scale masses .",
    "when @xmath76 as in eq.([quantumvacuum ] ) , the sixth hyperquark becomes massive .",
    "therefore , the above vacuum in eq.([quantumvacuum ] ) may be also studied by means of the effective superpotential obtained through integrating out the sixth hyperquark instead of the second one : @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "the dynamical scale @xmath79 is different from the previous @xmath60 by a simple - threshold relation @xcite @xmath80 . from this superpotential",
    "we obtain @xmath81 similarly we obtain @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which lead us to conclude that in the quantum vacuum in eq.([quantumvacuum ] ) we have the desired breaking of the gut gauge group down to the standard - model one @xmath84 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we have a pair of massless bound states @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "since they have u(1)@xmath5 -charges , they contribute to the renormalization - group equations of three gauge coupling constants in the standard model .",
    "we now show that a natural extension of our original superpotential given in eq.([superpotential ] ) induces a sufficiently large mass to this dangerous singlet pair .",
    "it seems quite reasonable that there are nonrenormalizable operators in the superpotential suppressed by some scale @xmath85 higher than the gut scale ( originating from gravitational interaction , for example ) .",
    "we , thus , consider the lowest - dimensional nonrenormalizable operator consistent with our gauge and global symmetries that is to contain baryon superfields .",
    "that is @xmath86 this interaction generates a mass term for @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the effective superpotential as @xmath87 which corresponds to the physical mass for @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xmath88 taking @xmath89 , @xmath90 gev and @xmath91 gev , we obtain @xmath92 gev . in fig.1",
    "we show two - loop renormalization - group flows of three gauge coupling constants , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , with @xmath95 gev and @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "we see that our model is marginally consistent with the gut unification and the small value of @xmath94 is favored .",
    "it may be interesting that the recently reported @xmath97 anomaly implies rather small @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the higher - dimensional operator in eq.([highdimop ] ) stabilizes the present vacuum given in eq.([quantumvacuum ] ) and there is no flat direction around the vacuum besides the directions of @xmath99 @xmath46 . ) we have another flat direction given by @xmath100 . ]",
    "in this paper we have proposed a model for the dynamical generation of light higgs doublets in susy - gut s based on a semisimple gauge group su(3)@xmath0 @xmath101 su(5)@xmath1 .",
    "the su(3)@xmath0 interactions become strong at the gut scale and cause a dynamical breaking of the su(5)@xmath1 .",
    "we have found that there is indeed a desired quantum vacuum corresponding to the breaking @xmath102 .",
    "we have also noted that an introduction of a higher - dimensional operator in eq.([highdimop ] ) to the superpotential stabilizes the desired quantum vacuum .",
    "moreover , the same operator gives rise to a mass for the composite baryon states @xmath66 and @xmath67 of the order of @xmath103 gev , which makes our model consistent with the gut unification of three gauge coupling constants of @xmath84 .",
    "finally , we comment on the proton decay via the dimension - five operators @xcite . in the present vacuum ,",
    "the mass matrix for color - triplet states @xmath104 and @xmath105 is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "the dimension - five operators are proportional to @xmath109 , which is at the order of the gut scale , @xmath110 .",
    "thus , we have unsuppressed proton decays . gev . ]",
    "this is a crucial point to distinguish the present model from the previous one @xcite .",
    "the reason for having non - vanishing dimension - five operators is that @xmath76 induces the effective mass for @xmath111 and @xmath18 and hence there remains no u(1)@xmath24 symmetry never generates the mass term for @xmath19 and @xmath112 as seen in eq.([weff ] ) . ] , which forbids the dimension - five operators for the proton decays .",
