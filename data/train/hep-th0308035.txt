    "in 1996 we proposed @xcite that a new class of quantum field theories might exist , in which the lagrangian need not be hermitian , yet the theory still might possess a positive spectrum . in these theories both parity @xmath1 and time - reversal @xmath2 invariance were violated , but the product @xmath0 symmetry was unbroken .",
    "apparently , it is the presence of @xmath0 symmetry that replaces hermiticity in guaranteeing positivity of the spectrum .    in early papers we examined parity violation in scalar field theories with interaction",
    "@xcite@xmath3 proved that the supersymmetry of theories possessing the superpotential @xcite @xmath4 was not broken by ( nonperturbative ) quantum corrections , suggested that a stable eigenvalue condition held in massless electrodynamics defined by an axial vector current @xcite @xmath5 and showed that the schwinger - dyson equations for the theory @xcite @xmath6 possessed both perturbative and nonperturbative solutions .",
    "in this talk we will reconsider the @xmath0-symmetric version of massless electrodynamics @xcite , which is described by the lagrangian @xmath7 our conventions are the following : @xmath8 is antisymmetric and pure imaginary , @xmath9 is symmetric and real , @xmath10 is antisymmetric and real , and @xmath11 .",
    "the fermion field @xmath12 is expected to be complex .",
    "@xmath13 possesses gauge invariance : @xmath14 the gauge transformation on the fermion field is not a phase transformation , but a scale transformation ; nevertheless it leaves invariant the fermion bilinears in the lagrangian , and in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "note that a mass term @xmath15 breaks this gauge symmetry .",
    "we had expected ( erroneously as we shall see ) the weak - coupling feynman rules , for graphs with even numbers of @xmath16s to be the same as those in ordinary qed , except that @xmath17 .",
    "this is very intriguing , for it suggests that the program of johnson , baker and willey @xcite might succeed , for now their eigenvalue condition for the fine structure constant reads , in terms of the `` quenched '' beta function , @xmath18 which displays all the coefficients calculated to date ( remarkably integers ) .",
    "keeping two , three , and four terms in this series gives a sequence of quite stable positive roots : @xmath19      this is an appropriate point to acknowledge an error in ref .",
    "there it was stated that the eigenfunction condition in conventional qed , obtained by replacing @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ jbw ] ) , possesses only the following successive positive roots of @xmath20 : @xmath21 these were nearly completely misstated .",
    "the correct positive roots are @xmath22 the conclusion , however , that the conventional qed shows no sign of stability of the eigenvalue , is of course unaltered .      however , there is no furry s theorem for this @xmath0-symmetric electrodynamics , because the antisymmetrical charge matrix @xmath23 of ordinary qed is replaced by the antisymmetrical @xmath24 matrix : ( @xmath12 is a grassmann element ) @xmath25 thus there is a three - photon triangle graph as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "this would seem to completely change the weak coupling expansion from that in normal qed .",
    "in particular , @xmath20 is not simply obtained from that in ordinary qed !",
    "it is well - known that the aaa triangle graph possesses an axial - vector anomaly .",
    "this is usually seen as a consequence of enforcing bose symmetry , which thereby resolves the ambiguity associated with a superficially linearly divergent loop integration @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the more familiar avv graph , where the axial anomaly arises from enforcement of vector current conservation @xcite",
    ".      it should be instructive to see how this comes about in a method in which all quantities are explicitly finite .",
    "this is the `` causal '' or `` dispersive '' approach , advocated by schwinger s source - theory group in 1970s .",
    "as it happens , i have an unpublished manuscript @xcite which presents the calculation of precisely the above graph in spectral form , for the general situation in which all particles have masses : @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the mass of the fermion , the outgoing `` photon '' momenta are on the mass shell , @xmath28 , and we have set @xmath29 and @xmath30 appropriate for real , outgoing vector particles .",
    "this is a consequence of the property of the three polarization vectors for a massive , spin-1 particle : @xmath31    the spectral functions are determined by taking a cut across the @xmath23-@xmath32 lines in the graph : ( @xmath33 ) @xmath34\\gamma_5\\gamma_\\nu ( m-\\gamma q')\\gamma_5\\gamma_\\alpha(m+\\gamma q)\\bigg]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & q_\\alpha\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\sigma}p^\\lambda p^{\\prime\\sigma } a_2(m^2 ) + \\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\alpha}(p - p')^\\lambda a_1(m^2 ) .",
    "\\label{cut}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the invariant phase - space measure is @xmath35 explicit formula may be straightforwardly worked out for the spectral functions for this general mass case : @xmath36\\frac1{4v\\zeta}\\ln\\phi\\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath37\\frac1{4v\\zeta}\\ln\\phi,\\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath38 and @xmath39    the anomaly is obtained by taking the divergence with respect to the unrestricted vertex @xmath40 , that is , by multiplying by @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 where the spectral function in the integral is just the @xmath41 contraction with the cut amplitude ( [ cut ] ) .",
    "it has a rather simple form : @xmath43 the integral vanishes as @xmath44 .",
    "the anomaly arises because now @xmath45 : @xmath46 the evaluation , independent of @xmath47 , may be straightforwardly verified .",
    "of course , the case of direct interest is much simpler , because @xmath48 for a photon : @xmath49 it might appear that the correct limit here is to first set @xmath50 , then take @xmath51 .",
    "however this is an anomalous threshold situation , best handled by analytic continuation from the @xmath52 case .    so the @xmath0-symmetric electrodynamics proposed by us in ref .",
    "@xcite seems to possess a serious difficulty : because @xmath1-violating green s functions occur , containing an odd number of @xmath53 vertices  that is , there is no furry s theorem  an axial vector anomaly can occur in the theory .",
    "we have explicitly calculated such an anomaly .",
    "therefore , it appears that the theory is rendered nonrenormalizable .",
    "the nonrenormalizable divergent graphs appear when , for example , the two photons of the triangle graph are attached to a fermion line , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "there are a number of caveats that must be noted concerning this conclusion :    * the feynman rules , and the unitarity arguments that lead to the dispersion relations , may have to be modified in the @xmath0 theory because the contours that define the theory do not lie along the real axis in general .",
    "* there may be a subtlety associated with massless fermions .",
    "* although this particular version of @xmath0qed may be flawed , it may be possible to find other variants .",
    "( we shall suggest such a possibility in the next section . ) * of course , it must always be acknowledged that the criterion of renormalizability is not the final arbiter ; nonrenormalizable theories can still be useful , effective ones .",
    "the axial - vector current theory seems to be fatally flawed .",
    "fortunately , there is an alternative @xmath0-symmetric theory which seems to be , in fact , closer to the spirit of the general development .",
    "instead , i propose using the usual current , j^=12 ^",
    "0^eq , but couple it to an _ axial - vector _ photon field @xmath54 : _ int = ij^a_. note that the factor of @xmath55 is inserted to ensure @xmath0 invariance . under either @xmath1 or @xmath2 separately ,",
    "the time component of @xmath56 does not change , while the space component reverses sign , hence @xmath57 this is consistent with the modified maxwell equations , @xmath58 provided under @xmath0 : is an axial vector and @xmath59 is a polar vector , if the scalar potential but not the vector potential , changes sign under parity ( this smells a bit like magnetic charge ) , or @xmath59 is an axial vector and @xmath60 is a polar vector if the vector potential not the scalar potential changes sign under parity .",
    "the latter is more a theory of electric charge . ] : , , a^- a^. @xmath0 invariance of the theory is thus assured : _ int_int .",
    "this theory seems to be a @xmath0qed with        this new theory would seem to be asymptotically free , since the sign of the beta function reverses from that in ordinary qed .",
    "an antiscreening effect may occur here because of the attraction of like charges .",
    "quantum - mechanically , the sign of the vacuum polarization reverses . whether this implies confinement is under investigation .",
    "we are also examining questions of the stability of the vacuum , in the presence of a strong electric field @xmath63 .",
