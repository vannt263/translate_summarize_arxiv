    "<S> similarly , quantum state storage @xcite is a central ingredient for quantum networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the past two decades , the experimental progress in teleporting and storing quantum states realized on different physical systems has been impressive @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particularly groundbreaking are the demonstrations involving continuous variable ( cv ) systems @xcite , where states having an infinite - dimensional support , such as coherent and squeezed states , have been unconditionally teleported and stored between light modes and atomic ensembles in virtually all possible combinations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments might be reckoned as stepping stones for the _ quantum internet _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    ideally , teleportation and storage aim at the realization of a perfect identity channel between an unknown input state @xmath1 , issued to the sender alice , and the output state received by bob . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , this is possible if alice and bob share a maximally entangled state , supplemented by classical communication @xcite . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> limitations on the available entanglement and technical imperfections lead to an output state @xmath2 which is not , in general , a perfect replica of the input . </S>",
    "<S> it is then customary to quantify the success of the protocol in terms of the input - output fidelity @xcite @xmath3 , averaged over an ensemble @xmath4 of possible input states , sampled according to a prior distribution known to alice and bob . to assess whether the execution of transmission protocols takes advantage of genuine quantum resources , it is mandatory to establish benchmarks for the average fidelity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a benchmark is given in terms of a threshold @xmath5 , corresponding to the maximum average fidelity that can be reached without sharing any entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in a classical procedure alice might just attempt to estimate @xmath1 through an appropriate measurement , and communicate the outcome to bob , who could then prepare an output state based on such an outcome : this defines a `` measure - and - prepare '' strategy . for a given ensemble @xmath6 , the _ classical fidelity threshold _ ( cft ) @xmath5 amounts then to the highest average fidelity achievable by means of measure - and - prepare strategies . </S>",

    "<S> , the cft goes to zero , as it becomes impossible for alice to guess a particular input state with a single measurement . however , for a quantum implementation it is meaningless to assume that the laboratory source can produce arbitrary input states from an infinite - dimensional hilbert space with nearly uniform probability distribution . to benchmark cv implementations </S>",

    "<S> gaussian states _ have been employed as the preferred information carriers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> gaussian states enjoy a privileged role as , on one hand , their mathematical description only requires a finite number of variables ( first and second moments of the canonical mode operators ) @xcite , and on the other , they represent the set of states which can be reliably engineered and manipulated in a multitude of laboratory setups @xcite . high - fidelity teleportation and storage architectures involving gaussian states @xcite can be scaled up to realize networks @xcite and hybrid teamworks @xcite , and cascaded to build nonlinear gates for universal quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of benchmarking the transmission of gaussian states is thus of pressing relevance for quantum technology .    </S>",
