    "this is a new type of isotopic doping , different from the usual random doping process . in the cid ,",
    "the doping atoms are constrained within an area with radius @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath69 is small , cid is actually a big doping molecule . if the radius @xmath69 is very large , it acts like an interface .",
    "the cid can affect the phonon thermal conductance , yet has no effect on the electron transport properties .",
    "[ fig_t_p_rc ] is the phonon thermal properties at different cluster size @xmath69 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows that cid has limited effect on the low frequency phonon , as the cid plays like one molecule for small @xmath69 .",
    "so the low frequency phonon still has large transmission probability .",
    "if the radius @xmath69 is large , now the icd looks like an interface , which is easier for the low frequency phonon to pass through.@xcite actually , isotopes would scatter phonons of wavelength of the same order as their radius . however , the size of the isotope is in the order of [ 0 , 9 ] angstrom .",
    "this is much lesser than wavelength of the long wavelength phonons , so the low frequency phonon is easier to pass through .",
    "the most important effect of the cid is in the frequency range around 800 @xmath83 , and the highest frequency region around 1600 @xmath83 .",
    "these two frequency regions are mainly for the optical phonon modes in the three directions . for @xmath105   ,",
    "the high frequency phonons are filtered out completely . with the increase of the cid size , the phonon thermal conductance decreases gradually .",
    "this is different from what have been observed in the random isotopic doping , where the thermal conductivity decrease rapidly in low concentrate region and saturate in high concentrate , because the localized modes plays an important role in the random isotopic doping case , while the cid is more or less like an interface with large @xmath69 .",
    "[ fig_zt_rc ] shows the @xmath2 at different cid size . with the increase of @xmath69",
    ", the value of @xmath2 will increase .",
    "the cid can only enhance the value of @xmath2 slightly , as the only effect from cid is the reduction of thermal conductance which is actually small .",
    "the position of the peak in the @xmath2 figure does not affected by the cid , as the main feature of the @xmath2 is determined by the electronic contribution instead of the phonon thermal conductance .",
    "[ fig_t_strain ] demonstrates the effect of the strain on the phonon and electron transmission functions .",
    "both elongation and compress strains are studied .",
    "panel ( a ) shows that the strain favors to filter out the low frequency phonons .",
    "the situation has become quite difficult for low frequency phonons to get through the center region even under a very small strain .",
    "this is quite comprehensible , because the strain can be regarded as a kind of long wavelength acoustic phonon mode .",
    "it prefers to resonate with the low frequency acoustic phonons in the swcnt , and filter them out efficiently .",
    "the figure shows that in case of @xmath106 , phonons around 1200 @xmath83 are almost filtered out completely , and the @xmath3 mode shows a red shift .",
    "the @xmath3 mode is the in - plane optical phonon modes in swcnt , and this red shift has been observed in the experiment.@xcite the @xmath3 mode will also be filtered out under larger elongation strain , eg .",
    "@xmath107 in the figure .",
    "if @xmath108 , phonons around 1400 @xmath83 will be filtered out and the @xmath3 mode shows blue shift .",
    "the suppress of phonon modes at 1200 @xmath83 or 1400 @xmath83 is related to the vibrational properties of these phonons which are determined by the interactions in the swcnt .",
    "the interaction is described by the brenner potential , where the interaction range is upto second - nearest neighboring atoms .",
    "the phonon modes at 1200 ( 1400 ) @xmath83 corresponds to the optical phonons at high - symmetric k ( m ) point at the edge of the brillouin zone of graphene.@xcite they are not raman active modes in pure graphene .",
    "however , they can lead to the so - called raman d peak if graphene has some defects.@xcite it means that these two modes are more sensitive to the defect of the structure . as a result , they show more obvious response to the strain , i.e suppressed by strain .",
    "our results indicate that the elongation strain can cause obvious modification to the k point , while the compress strain has significant influence on the m point .",
    "panel ( b ) displays the effect of the strain on the electron transmission function .",
    "the strain smooths the steps in the electron transmission function .",
    "this is because we have treated the strain as a kind of phonon vibration , thus the strain effect can be considered from the electron - phonon interaction hamiltonian . in this hamiltonian ,",
    "the effect of the strain is to modify the hopping parameter of the tight - binding model , which will shift and deform the electron bands .",
    "however , because of the simplicity of the electron bands from tight - binding model , the shift and deformation do not change the number of the bands in most energy region , except those at the band edge . in the ballistic transport regime , the transmission function is determined by the number of electron bands .",
    "so the transmission function and other electronic properties are only affected by strain through smoothing out the band edges .",
    "the shift and deformation of the electron bands will be accumulated from low energy region to higher energy region . as a result",
    ", the strain effect will be more obvious for higher energy sub - bands , which leads to more asymmetry between positive and negative strain for higher sub - bands .",
    "[ fig_k_p_strain ] shows strain can significantly reduce the phonon thermal conductance .",
    "the reduction is still obvious even in low temperature region , because the strain can filter out both low frequency phonons and the high frequency phonons .",
    "this figure also shows that the elongation strain can affect the phonon thermal conductance more distinctly than the compress strain .",
    "for example , the @xmath109 is reduced by about 70@xmath110 at high temperature under @xmath111 , while this value is about 50@xmath110 under @xmath112 .",
    "this is because the @xmath3 mode in the swcnt shows red shift under small elongation strain , and will be filtered out completely under larger elongation strain .",
    "this effect sheds some light on the nonequivalent of the elongation and compress strain in the swcnt .",
    "[ fig_zt_strain ] shows strain effect on the electron transport properties and the @xmath2 .",
    "the electronic conductance will have a smoother step around these subband edges , because the transmission function has been smoothed at the subband edge .",
    "correspondingly , the electron thermal conductance has similar changes in its curve as shown in panel ( b ) .",
    "panel ( c ) shows that the seebeck coefficient is almost unaffected by the strain , because the strain only affect the subband edge structure , which actually has limited effect on the seebeck coefficient .",
    "panel ( d ) displays the effect of strain on the value of @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 decreases under strain , as the peak of the @xmath2 is due to the sudden jump in the electron transport channels and this jump has now been smoothed out by the strain .",
    "we have checked that the phonon and electron properties do not depend on the length of the swcnt if the same strain is applied , because the phonon and electron are both described by short - range interaction and the applied strain is uniform .",
    "to conclude , the thermoelectric properties of swcnt are systematically studied in the negf scheme in the ballistic transport regime . for the pure and perfect swcnt",
    ", we study the size and chiral symmetry effect .",
    "it was found that in the semi - conductor swcnt the thermal conductance is mainly determined by the phonon , while the electron has very limited contribution .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath2 is about 0.2 in the semi - conductor swcnt . for metallic swcnt ,",
    "the value of the @xmath2 is much smaller , because of the small value of the seebeck coefficient due to zero band gap in the electron band structure .",
    "besides the pure and perfect swcnt , we also study the thermoelectric properties in the swcnt after cid or under strain .",
    "the cid acts like a big doping molecule in case of small cluster size , and like an interface in case of large cluster size .",
    "this type of isotopic doping can reduce the phonon thermal conductance , thus enhancing the @xmath2 .",
    "we comparatively study the effect of elongation and compress strain , and find that the elongation strain can reduce the thermal conductance more efficiently than the compress strain .",
    "the strain also considerably modifies the curve of electronic conductance at band edges . finally , the @xmath2 becomes smaller under strain , because the reduction in the electronic conductance overcomes the reduction in the thermal conductance .",
    "we further remark that we have applied methods of ballistic transport to compute transport parameters , and ultimately using them to find @xmath2 . at temperatures exceeding 1000",
    "k , the phonon transport should take into consideration anharmonic phonon interactions , which would lead to a decrease in thermal conductivity at such high temperatures , rather than the saturation effect seen in these figures for the phonon thermal conductance . as a result , this would only reduce thermal conductivity and work to boost @xmath2 .",
