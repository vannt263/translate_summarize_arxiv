    "the distribution of sdb masses is one of the most important constraints to identify the formation channel among several possibilities .",
    "hw vir type binaries are a group of detached binary systems that consist of sdbs and late m star companions with periods of about @xmath5 . because of the short possible periods and the similar size of both components such systems have high probability to be eclipsing . until now",

    "+ soker ( 1998 ) proposed the idea that planetary or brown dwarf companions could cause the mass loss necessary to form an sdb .",
    "substellar objects with masses higher than @xmath6 were predicted to survive the common - envelope phase and end up in a close orbit around the stellar remnant , while planets with lower masses would entirely evaporate .",
    "+ following this nelemans and tauris ( 1998 ) suggested a scenario to form low mass white dwarfs accompanied by a substellar object .",

    "however the sdb progenitor could have been more massive ( @xmath67 ) and therefore younger . in this case",

    "it gives an sdb mass of @xmath71 and a companion mass of @xmath72 .",
    "the low sdb mass implies that the star does not burn helium in the core but evolves into a helium white dwarf ( driebe et al .",

    "we regard it more likely that it is an ehb star rather than a post - rgb star since the latter seem to be rare .",
