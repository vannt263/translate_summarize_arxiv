    "in compact qed ( cqed ) there are two distinct phases .",
    "the weak coupling regime corresponds to the coulomb phase with massless photons and has been investigated in very detail in the extremely successful program of perturbation theory .",
    "however , there is also a second regime realized in the strong coupling region , which has become an important research topic since the 1980s . here , magnetic monopoles cause the creation of electric flux tubes leading to a linear potential and therefore to confinement . although the confinement mechanism in qed seems to be rather different from the one in qcd , the investigation of the former gives some inference to the confinement in qcd , which is far more complex to investigate due to its non - abelian structure .    in the weak coupling phase",
    "the monopoles are supposed to disappear but they can survive in meta - stable states .",
    "there has been intensive discussion whether the phase transition between these two phases is of first or second order . for a long time it seemed that this transition is of first order@xcite .",
    "some later investigations suggested a second order phase transition@xcite .",
    "recent studies@xcite strongly suggest a first order transition again .",
    "the investigation of the order of the phase transition is of vital importance since the continuum limit can only be obtained in the case of a second order transition .",
    "here we give a short summary of compact qed on the lattice .",
    "the wilson action@xcite of qed is given by @xmath4 a common choice for the definition of the field - strength is @xmath5 where the physical angle @xmath6 $ ] is obtained by splitting off @xmath7 the number of dirac strings penetrating a plaquette @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 are gauge - dependent contrary to @xmath11 . in our simulations we use the definition due to lang",
    "et al.@xcite @xmath12 where the field strength is a continuous function of @xmath13 and takes into account @xmath14-periodicity .",
    "this definition is achieved by a variation of the wilson action@xcite and is therefore in agreement with the gau law on the lattice . as will be described further below , definition ( [ ft ] )",
    "allows to investigate continuous shifts of monopoles by arbitrary non - integer distances , a property which we need for our investigations .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction an interesting feature of @xmath15 gauge theory is the appearance of magnetic monopoles .",
    "so we will shortly recall the fundamental relations for dirac monopoles .",
    "dirac considered a 3-dimensional ball surrounding a magnetic point charge yielding the following relation @xmath16 the boundary of a boundary like @xmath17 is zero , which implies that the vector potential diverges at a single point on the sphere for non - vanishing @xmath18 .",
    "one is lead to the picture of monopoles connected by arbitrary lines with a diverging vector potential along them .",
    "these lines are the famous dirac strings .",
    "their position is gauge dependent .",
    "so , there are two kinds of divergences . first the `` true '' physical divergences of monopoles and the unphysical `` gauge '' divergences of dirac strings .",
    "furthermore , dirac showed that the electric charge @xmath19 is quantized by the existence of a single magnetic charge @xmath18 since the wave function of an electric charge transported along @xmath20 is modified by @xmath21 transporting @xmath19 around the boundary @xmath17 of eq .",
    "( [ dirac ] ) , the non - ambiguity of @xmath22 demands @xmath23 setting @xmath24 yields for the smallest ( @xmath25 ) charge quantum @xmath26",
    "dirac monopoles in compact u(1 ) theory can be identified according to degrand and toussaint@xcite as follows .",
    "the plaquette angle @xmath27\\ ] ] has no direct physical meaning since the action has a periodicity of @xmath14 only .",
    "furthermore , the sum of six plaquette angles enclosing a cube vanishes since each link of the cube is counted twice but in opposite direction . in the language of forms",
    "the cube is the exterior differential of the six plaquettes ( respectively angles ) , which are the exterior differentials of their links . due to",
    "the bianchi identity ( `` the boundary of a boundary is zero '' ) the sum of the six plaquette angles of a cube vanishes .",
    "dirac strings can be closed or start and end at magnetic monopoles .",
    "thus , the magnetic charge in a cube , respectively the number of monopoles in it is given by the sum of in - going minus out - going strings .",
    "it is an integer multiple of @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding four - current is given by @xmath29 where we used the ( forward ) lattice derivative @xmath30 .",
    "obviously , this current is source - free ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "identifying monopoles this way allows to count the number of monopoles in each cube only . for the identification of monopole positions inside cubes we have to choose another method .",
    "this second method , which is due to ref .",
    "@xcite detects monopoles by measuring the magnetic fluxes leaving cubes .",
    "the distribution of the flux over six plaquettes surrounding a cube reflects the position of the monopole inside .",
    "then , the monopole current is given by the dual maxwell equations , which read in covariant notation @xmath32 with the dual field strength - tensor @xmath33 .",
    "using the definition of the dual field strength - tensor and eqs .",
    "( [ ft ] ) and ( [ me ] ) yields for the magnetic four - current on the lattice @xmath34 evidently , this current is also conserved ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the magnetic charge in the cube at position @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 in this definition the monopole charge in each cube is not an integer multiple of @xmath18 . only for infinitely separated monopoles investigated in the classical limit",
    ", the charge inside a large surface enclosing a monopole is an integer multiple of @xmath18 since @xmath38 .",
    "this leads to the picture of a single cube yielding the main contribution to the magnetic charge of the monopole , while the neighboring cubes contribute with a few percent .",
    "since this charge distribution is independent of the lattice constant monopoles are still `` point - like '' .",
    "this definition of monopole currents was investigated in detail in ref .",
    "it was shown that the definition ( [ q ] ) is necessary to get agreement with the dual superconductor picture of confinement and the dual london equation@xcite .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) we introduce a monopole s center of mass @xmath39 depending on the flux distribution around the monopole where @xmath40 corresponds to space - like cubes with a positive contribution to the magnetic charge and correspondingly for @xmath41 . with definition ( [ com ] )",
    "it is possible to obtain positions of monopoles which are not restricted to integer values .",
    "for the realization of a classical monopole - configuration on the lattice we discuss two possibilities :    * since a plaquette is part of the surface of four cubes , a non - vanishing plaquette value corresponds to non - zero magnetic currents in these cubes . on the dual lattice the corresponding links",
    "assemble a plaquette . following this line of thought , fixing the value of an @xmath42-plaquette leads to a rotating current in the @xmath43-plane .",
    "further fixing of all @xmath42-plaquettes with given coordinates @xmath44 and arbitrary @xmath45 and closing them periodically at the boundary of the lattice yields two currents in @xmath45-direction but with opposite sign . for",
    "sufficiently large plaquette angles the two currents in @xmath45-direction represent a static monopole - antimonopole pair .",
    "thus , arbitrary monopole configurations can be realized by fixing corresponding plaquettes appropriately . + after specifying the constraints for a static monopole pair we minimize the action by local cooling . in fig .",
    "[ jthe ] the sum of the absolute values of the magnetic charges in one time slice @xmath46 in dependence on the angle of the plaquette separating the monopole pair is shown .",
    "+ . besides the measured data and the result due to the definition of degrand - toussaint an analytical approximation formula",
    "is plotted which is given by @xmath47 . ] + using definition ( [ dgt ] ) yields zero charge for plaquette angles in the interval @xmath48 $ ] followed by a discrete jump at @xmath49 to @xmath50 when a dirac string penetrates the plaquette . using definition ( [ zach ] ) this jump",
    "is spread out ( see fig .  [ jthe ] ) .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the charge of the monopole in definition ( [ zach ] ) is distributed over several cubes , allowing for charge annihilation for a monopole pair at close distance .",
    "furthermore , values for the approximation formula @xmath51 are plotted in fig .",
    "this expression is obtained by considering two large closed surfaces each surrounding one monopole and assuming that all plaquettes @xmath52 , except the tuned one @xmath53 , have small values @xmath54 .",
    "+ * constraints with local chemical potentials @xmath55 introduced at single cubes can be used to create monopoles at given positions .",
    "the potentials are introduced in the action as follows @xmath56 with the plaquette angle @xmath54 , the chemical potential @xmath57 , the magnetic current @xmath58 and the sum @xmath59 extending over all cubes . fixing a chemical potential @xmath60 for a static monopole pair at a distance of one lattice spacing followed by local cooling preserves such a monopole - antimonopole pair for values @xmath61 only , see fig .",
    "+   introduced at neighboring cubes . ]",
    "+ one can observe that the charge for the monopole pair created at @xmath62 is approximately @xmath63 and increases continuously to a value near @xmath50 .",
    "for smaller values of @xmath64 the chemical potential is not strong enough to keep apart a monopole pair at a distance of one against their magnetic attraction .",
    "the monopoles approach each other with decreasing @xmath64 , therefore the magnetic charge densities of monopoles and antimonopoles overlap leading to gradual annihilation . for increasing @xmath64",
    "the monopoles are closer at the centers of the cubes and their overlap decreases .",
    "since the charge of the monopole is distributed over more than a single cube a value of @xmath50 can not be attained for a monopole pair at distance one . in a strict sense ,",
    "only infinitely separated monopoles obtain the value @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , as soon as a monopole pair is created one would expect local minima of the action @xmath65 .",
    "indeed this is true for @xmath61 as can be seen in fig .",

    "[ sethe ] the action @xmath65 in dependence on the value @xmath67 of the plaquette , which separates the monopole pair is shown for various values of @xmath64 .",
    "one can clearly recognize local minima of @xmath65 for @xmath61 .",
    "the potential @xmath68 of a static monopole pair in the classical limit corresponds to the action @xmath69 , since the kinetic energy @xmath70 vanishes . using the monopole definition ( [ dgt ] ) due to degrand - toussaint@xcite",
    "the monopole charge is contained entirely in single cubes and the potential can be determined for integer distances only . due to the electro - magnetic duality",
    "a monopole pair feels a @xmath0-potential at large separations .",
    "we investigate the monopole - antimonopole potential not only for integer distances but for arbitrary real ones . for this purpose",
    "monopoles must be movable inside cubes .",
    "this can be achieved by tuning of appropriate plaquettes .",
    "[ moving ] shows the result of such tuning .     and the positions of monopoles .",
    "the vertical straight line at @xmath71 indicates the position of the tuned plaquette @xmath67 . introducing a chemical potential @xmath72 at @xmath73 and tuning of @xmath67 followed by cooling leads to an antimonopole in the cube at @xmath73 and a monopole in the vicinity of the tuned plaquette . ]    the chemical potential is set to @xmath72 at the cube centered at @xmath74 , while the angle @xmath67 of the plaquette with its center at @xmath75 is tuned . after choosing appropriate values of @xmath67 cooling",
    "generates an antimonopole near @xmath74 the center of the cube with non - vanishing @xmath55 .",
    "the position of the monopole depends strongly on the value of @xmath67 . for @xmath76",
    "the plaquette is pierced by a dirac - string and the position of the monopole is larger than two . with decreasing @xmath67 the monopole is continuously shifted towards the antimonopole .",
    "one can observe that for @xmath77 the monopole is shifted slightly to an @xmath36-value below @xmath78 , which is due to magnetic attraction .",
    "calculations for large separations with and without chemical potentials show that the wilson part of the action @xmath65 does not differ .    using the above procedure it is possible to generate monopole pair configurations at arbitrary real distances . the potential of a static monopole pair in dependence on their distance yields fig .  [ action ] .     of the tuned plaquette which allows to vary the monopole position .",
    "]    the coordinate @xmath79 of the tuned plaquette @xmath67 varies from @xmath80 to @xmath81 in integer steps .",
    "the values of @xmath79 used to determine the potential are indicated in the figure .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the well - known @xmath0-potential is superimposed by oscillations with a wave length of lattice spacing @xmath82 .",
    "these oscillations are obviously due to the granularity of the lattice .",
    "local minima are located at integer distances , while the maxima can be found at half - integer separations .",
    "this behavior of the potential at non - integer distances may lead to the well - known observation that some monopole loops survive the transition from the confined to the coulomb phase .",
    "@xcite and @xcite report strong indications that this phase transition is of first order .",
    "a vanishing of the two - state signal was detected in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite on a lattice with a topology homo - topic to an s@xmath83-sphere .",
    "this was explained by the fact that for such a topology monopole loops may contract and disappear without restriction .",
    "a discretization of an s@xmath83 where the curvature is distributed almost homogeneously over the lattice favors a contraction of arbitrary monopole loops and decreases the influence of meta - stabilities like those appearing in fig .",

    "magnetic monopoles feel a coulomb potential in analogy to electric point - like charges , if they are located in the centers of the lattice cubes .",
    "the above results demonstrate deviations from the @xmath0-behavior when the monopoles are shifted away from the centers . we find it interesting to investigate whether the meta - stabilities appearing in the potential due to the resulting hysteresis are strong enough to influence the order of the phase transition .",
