    "it was also mentioned that such an estimate as ( [ bure ] ) does not depend on the choice of filtration @xmath37 .",

    "a perturbation of the martingale transform was investigated .",
    "namely , under the same assumptions as ( [ convavo ] ) it was proved that for @xmath40 , @xmath41 we have the sharp estimate @xmath42 it was also claimed to be proven that the same sharp estimate holds for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and the case @xmath45 was left open .",
    "the inequality ( [ bor ] ) stems from important questions concerning the @xmath46 bounds for the perturbation of beurling  ahlfors operator and hence it is of interest .",
    "we refer the reader to recent works regarding martingale inequalities and estimates of beurling  ahlfors operator @xcite and references therein .",
    "we should mention that burkholder s method  @xcite and the bellman function approach  @xcite ,  @xcite have similar traces in the sense that both of them reduce the required estimate to finding a certain minimal diagonally concave function with prescribed boundary conditions .",
    "however , the methods of construction of such a function are different . unlike burkholder",
    "s method  @xcite , in  @xcite and  @xcite the construction of the function is based on the monge  ampre equation .",
    "firstly , we should mention that the proof of ( [ bor ] ) presented in  @xcite has a gap in the case @xmath43 , @xmath47 ( the constructed function does not satisfy necessary concavity condition ) .    in the present paper",

    "the condition @xmath54 holds when @xmath64 .",

    "it is worth mentioning that although the proof of the estimate ( [ bor ] ) has a gap in @xcite , the claimed result in the case @xmath43 , @xmath66 remains true as a result of theorem [ fm1 ] .",
    "one of the important results of the current paper is that we find the function ( [ bellmanf ] ) , and the above estimates are corollaries of this result .",
    "we would like to mention that unlike  @xcite and  @xcite the argument exploited in the current paper is different . instead of writing a lot of technical computations and checking",
    "which case is valid , we present some pure geometrical facts regarding minimal concave functions with prescribed boundary conditions , and by this way we avoid computations . moreover , we explain to the reader how we construct our bellman function ( [ bellmanf ] ) based on these geometrical facts derived in section  [ geom ] .      in section  [ sec2 ]",

    "we investigate some special foliation called the _ cup _ and another useful object , called _",
    "force functions_.    we should note that the theory of minimal concave functions in two variables does not include the minimal diagonally concave functions in three variables .",
    "nevertheless , this knowledge allows us to construct the candidate for @xmath70 in section [ construction ] , but with some additional technical work not mentioned in section [ geom ] .",
    "in section [ sharp ] we find the good estimates for the perturbed martingale transform . in section [ fol ]",
    "we prove that the candidate for @xmath70 constructed in section  [ construction ] coincides with @xmath70 , and as a corollary we show the sharpness of the estimates found for the perturbed martingale transform in section  [ sharp ] .    in conclusion",

    "we split the new pair @xmath902 at point @xmath1030 so we get the pairs @xmath1031 and @xmath1032 .",

    "let @xmath483 be such that @xmath1045 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath1046 is an admissible pair for the point @xmath1047 then the pairs @xmath1048 can be determined uniquely , and , moreover , @xmath1049 is an admissible pair for the point @xmath1050 for all @xmath1051 .",

    "now we try to find @xmath483 in terms of @xmath4 , and we try to find the value of @xmath1057 .    condition ( [ approx ] ) implies that @xmath1058 .",
    "we denote @xmath1059 therefore , after the @xmath483-th iteration we obtain @xmath1060 the requirement @xmath1061 implies that    @xmath1062    this implies that @xmath1063 .",
    "therefore , we get @xmath1064    also note that @xmath1065\\\\ & = 2{\\varepsilon}f(s_{0 } ) + ( 1+{\\varepsilon}\\delta_{0 } ) \\psi(f^{(1)},g^{(1 ) } ) + o({\\varepsilon}^{2}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , after the @xmath483-th iteration ( and using the fact that @xmath1066 ) we obtain @xmath1067 the last equality follows from the fact that @xmath1068 .",
    "therefore ( [ znachenie ] ) and ( [ znachenie1 ] ) imply that @xmath1069    now we recall ( [ value ] ) .",
    "so if we show that @xmath1070 then ( [ bolo ] ) will imply that @xmath1071 .",
    "so choosing @xmath4 sufficiently small we can obtain the extremizer @xmath1041 for the point @xmath926 .",
    "therefore , we need only to prove equality ( [ bolo ] ) . it will be convenient to make the following notations : set @xmath1072 , @xmath1073 , @xmath1074 , @xmath1075 , @xmath1076 , @xmath1077 , @xmath1078 and @xmath1079 .",
