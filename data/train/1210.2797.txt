    "in surface topology , it has long been of general interest to pose and study problems related to the existence and enumeration of collections of curves on a surface satisfying specified intersection properties .",
    "specifically , the following question , popularized by benson farb and which goes back to work of juvan , malnic and mohar @xcite , is an example of such a problem . in all that follows ,",
    "let @xmath2 denote the closed orientable surface of genus @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a collection of pairwise non - isotopic simple closed curves on @xmath2 indexed by an index set @xmath9 such that @xmath10 intersects @xmath11 no more than once for any @xmath12 .",
    "what is the maximum cardinality of @xmath9 ?",
    "this turns out to be a very difficult question ; at the time of the writing this paper , all that is so far known is that @xmath9 must be finite , and that there exists a quadratic lower bound and an exponential upper bound for the maximum size of @xmath9 , the best of which are due to the work of malestein , rivin and theran @xcite .",
    "following the same terminology of their paper , we define a @xmath13-@xmath14 to be a collection of simple closed curves on @xmath2 such that no two intersect more than @xmath13 times . in the same article",
    ", these authors address the following simpler variant of question 1 :    let @xmath0 be a collection of pairwise non - isotopic simple closed curves indexed by an index set @xmath9 such that @xmath10 intersects @xmath11 @xmath15 once for any @xmath12 . what is the maximum cardinality of @xmath9 ?",
    "given any @xmath16-system , we can construct its @xmath17 , which has a vertex for each curve in the collection , and an edge between any two curves that intersect .",
    "the @xmath16-systems which are the objects of study in question 2 are precisely those @xmath16-systems whose intersection graphs are complete ; therefore , we call such collections @xmath18 . malestein , rivin and theran answer question 2 by showing that any complete @xmath16-system can have no more than @xmath6 members , and that this bound is sharp for all @xmath19 .",
    "( genus @xmath16 ) recall that two simple closed curves are isotopic on the torus ( denoted by @xmath20 ) if and only if they are homologous ; therefore the distinct isotopy classes of simple closed curves are parameterized by ordered pairs of coprime integers . given two such classes",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 recall further that the @xmath23 @xmath24 , defined as the minimum number of times that any curve in @xmath25 intersects a curve in @xmath26 , is given by @xmath27 therefore by basic linear algebra , if we are given two curves @xmath28 on @xmath20 which intersect once , there is exactly one curve up to isotopy intersecting both @xmath25 and @xmath26 exactly once .",
    "hence any complete @xmath16-system on @xmath20 has no more than @xmath29 members .    by a @xmath30 , we mean a complete @xmath16-system on @xmath2 containing @xmath6 members .",
    "recall that the @xmath31 of a surface @xmath32 , denoted @xmath33 , is the group of isotopy classes of orientation preserving homeomorphisms from @xmath32 to itself ( for more details , see @xcite ) , and that @xmath34 is isomorphic to @xmath35 .",
    "example 1.1 also demonstrates that on the torus , a maximal complete @xmath16-system is unique up to the action of @xmath34 . that this is also the case for maximal complete @xmath16-systems on @xmath36",
    "is addressed in @xcite .",
    "this motivates malestein , rivin , and theran to pose the following question :    for @xmath37 , are maximal complete @xmath16-systems unique up to the action of the mapping class group @xmath38 ?    the main result of this paper answers this question in the negative ; specifically , we prove :    for @xmath39 , there exists at least @xmath40 distinct mapping class group orbits of maximal complete @xmath16-systems .",
    "the proof of theorem 1.2 is completed by explicitly constructing two distinct orbits on @xmath41 , and then attaching handles in a prescribed way to extend both orbits to higher genus surfaces .",
    "the construction for @xmath41 makes use of a particular gluing pattern on a @xmath42-gon ; when the edges are glued together via the prescribed pattern , a genus @xmath29 surface is obtained and the edges of the @xmath42-gon project down to a pair of simple closed curves intersecting @xmath43 times .",
    "in general , a collection of curves @xmath44 on @xmath2 is said to @xmath45 @xmath2 if @xmath46 is a disjoint union of topological disks .",
    "it is well known that for any @xmath1 there exists a pair of simple closed curves which fill .",
    "such filling pairs have been studied extensively ; for instance , one of the first examples of pseudo - anosov mapping classes came from considering compositions of dehn twists around filling pairs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one is then led to ask the following simple question :    what is the minimum number of times a pair of simple closed curves on @xmath2 must intersect in order to fill @xmath2 ?    in a forthcoming paper , ( joint with shinnyih huang ) , we prove @xcite    let @xmath47 be a pair of simple closed curves which fills @xmath2 . then @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , this bound is sharp for @xmath49 . if @xmath50 , then @xmath51 .",
    "the sharpness of this bound involves a combinatorial construction which is not directly relevant to this paper .",
    "however , we include a proof of the lower bound because it is elementary and it establishes an important correspondence between @xmath52 and the number of disks in the complement @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 : if @xmath47 fill , then we can take @xmath55 to be a @xmath16-skeleton of a cell decomposition of @xmath2 , where the vertices are the intersections and the edges are the arcs of @xmath56 and @xmath57 which run between intersection points .",
    "we remark that there are twice as many edges as there are vertices . letting @xmath58 denote the number of disks in @xmath59 , @xmath60 @xmath61 since @xmath62 , it follows that @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath63    therefore , a simple closed filling pair having a minimal number of intersections is equivalent to its complement being connected .",
    "thus cutting along such a pair of curves produces a single polygon with @xmath64 sides .",
    "one expects that a minimally intersecting filling pair should ` barely ' fill the surface , in that there are many simple closed curves intersecting the pair only once ; this was the motivation for considering the gluing patterns associated to minimally intersecting filling pairs to study large complete @xmath16-systems .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section @xmath40",
    ", we demonstrate the existence of a complete maximal @xmath16-system on @xmath2 and we provide a necessary condition for any other maximal complete @xmath16-system to be equivalent to this one . in section @xmath29",
    ", we complete the construction for @xmath41 , and in section @xmath65 , we extend this construction to all higher genera .    the author would like to thank yair minsky , w. patrick hooper , and ian biringer for numerous helpful conversations .",
    "in this section we briefly demonstrate that there exists a complete @xmath16-system with @xmath6 members on @xmath2 for all @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , @xmath2 can be obtained by identifying the opposite sides of a @xmath66-gon @xmath67 .",
    "then the arcs connecting opposite sides of @xmath67 project down to simple closed curves , any two of which intersect exactly once .",
    "-system on a genus @xmath40 surface , width=384 ]    denote this complete maximal @xmath16-system by @xmath68 ( so that @xmath69 is pictured above ) . by construction ,",
    "it is clear that all intersections in @xmath68 can be taken to occur at the same point .",
    "this property characterizes a class of maximal complete @xmath16-systems , as the following proposition makes precise .",
    "let @xmath70 be a complete maximal @xmath16-system on @xmath2 having the property that up to isotopy , all intersections occur at the same point",
    ". then @xmath70 and @xmath68 are equivalent modulo the action of @xmath38 .    up to ambient isotopy",
    ", thinking of @xmath71 as a graph on @xmath2 , @xmath70 has one vertex and @xmath6 edges . denoting by @xmath72 a small regular neighborhood of @xmath70",
    ", one can trace around @xmath73 to discover that @xmath74 has exactly two connected components , which we denote by @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( see figure @xmath40 below ) .    .",
    "the complement of @xmath77 in @xmath2 has two connected components , and each curve in @xmath77 is on the boundary of both @xmath75 and @xmath76.,width=384 ]    we claim that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are both disks ; indeed , @xmath78 @xmath79 pick points @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; then for each @xmath82 there exists an arc @xmath11 such that @xmath83 , and @xmath11 has endpoints @xmath84 and @xmath85 . letting @xmath86 denote the intersection point of @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath87 is a cellular decomposition of @xmath2 , and @xmath88 can be extended to a dual decomposition with one @xmath40-cell containing @xmath86 . thus cutting along @xmath89 yields a polygon with @xmath66 edges , and",
    "@xmath90 necessarily lift to line segments connecting opposite sides .",
    "pictured below is a gluing pattern on a @xmath42-gon which yields the closed orientable genus @xmath29 surface @xmath41 .",
    "-gon which produces a genus @xmath29 surface .",
    "the edges alternate between projecting down to one of two simple closed curves.,width=384 ]    the significance of the lettering is that edges a , b , c , d , e project down to arcs of one simple closed curve @xmath56 in that order , and edges f , g , h , i , j project down to arcs of another simple closed curve @xmath57 in that order ; @xmath56 and @xmath57 intersect @xmath43 times . note that there are @xmath43 distinct equivalence classes of vertices , each containing @xmath65 vertices of the above polygon .",
    "these @xmath43 classes of vertices correspond to the @xmath43 intersections between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we will use this gluing pattern to construct a maximal complete @xmath16-system @xmath91 which is distinct from @xmath92 , modulo the action of @xmath93 .",
    "we begin the construction by considering the three curves pictured below- one in red , one blue , and the third black .",
    "the three curves pairwise intersect exactly once and thus form a complete @xmath16-system .",
    "note that attempting to isotope the curves so that all three intersections occur at the same place may not , a priori , keep all three curves simple .",
    "indeed , we claim that these three curves can not be isotoped to make all three intersections coincide .",
    "the three curves pictured below can not be isotoped so as to make all three pairwise intersections coincide .",
    "-system . attempting to isotope the curves",
    "so that all intersections occur at the same point may result in one of the curves having self intersection .",
    ", width=4 ]    let @xmath94 be the subsurface consisting of a regular neighborhood of the union of the three curves .",
    "consider the four curves pictured below in figure @xmath43 ; the red and blue curves are the curves of the same colors in figure @xmath65 ; let @xmath95 be the subgroup of the fundamental group of @xmath96 generated by these four curves .",
    "then we will show that @xmath97 is a rank @xmath65 subgroup of @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the homomorphism induced by the inclusion @xmath100 .",
    "this will imply the conclusion of lemma @xmath101 , for if the three curves in figure @xmath65 could be isotoped so that all three intersections occur at the same place , it would imply that there is an isotopy of @xmath41 sending @xmath96 to a regular neighborhood of a bouquet of three circles .",
    "the rank of @xmath102 is unaffected by this isotopy , and therefore if such an isotopy exists , @xmath103 .     colored red , blue , yellow and green .",
    "the boundary of @xmath96 is drawn in dashed lines .",
    ", width=336 ]    the path consisting of the concatenated edges b , c , d , e comprise a spanning tree for @xmath104 ; thus we can contract them to obtain the following presentation for @xmath98 :    @xmath105    we abelianize @xmath98 to obtain @xmath106 by identifying the @xmath107 generator in the above presentation with the @xmath107 row vector of the @xmath108 identity matrix ; note that this is a valid abelianization because each generator and its inverse appear exactly once in the relator for the above presentation . then we can read off the images of the four curves pictured under the abelianization map ; in the order of red , blue , yellow , green , the images are    @xmath109    these four vectors are linearly independent over @xmath110 and therefore also over @xmath111 .",
    "hence @xmath112 has rank @xmath65 .",
    "alternatively , as was pointed out by ian biringer , this conclusion can be reached by observing that @xmath113 , @xmath114 has three connected components , and @xmath115 is connected .",
    "thus @xmath96 is a thrice punctured torus , and by examining the long exact sequence for homology of the pair @xmath116 one finds that @xmath117 injects into @xmath118 .    to complete the construction of @xmath91 , it suffices to extend the three curves pictured in figure @xmath65 to a maximal complete @xmath16-system by adding @xmath65 more curves .",
    "such a maximal complete @xmath16-system would have the property that it can not be isotoped so as to make all of the @xmath119 intersections coincide , and therefore can not be equivalent to @xmath92 modulo the action of @xmath93 .",
    "indeed , such a complete @xmath16-system exists and it is pictured below in figure @xmath120 ; the three curves of figure @xmath65 are colored according to their colors in figure @xmath65 .",
    "-system containing the three curves depicted in figure @xmath65 as a sub - complete @xmath16-system.,width=336 ]    note that no two of the above curves are isotopic because each intersects the other exactly once transversely ; for the same reason no curve pictured above can be nulhomotopic ( or even nulhomologous ) .",
    "this completes the construction of @xmath91 , and proves theorem 1.2 in the case @xmath121 .",
    "to construct @xmath122 we make the following observation : there exists a simple arc @xmath123 which intersects each member of @xmath91 exactly once transversely ( see figure @xmath124 ) .",
    "then we can cut out two open disks @xmath125 with disjoint closures , such that the boundary of each contains one endpoint of @xmath123 and such that the closure of each is disjoint from @xmath91 .",
    "take two parallel copies @xmath126 of @xmath123 , and glue an annulus @xmath75 to @xmath127 along its two boundary components .",
    "by ` parallel ' , we mean an arc isotopic to @xmath123 via an isotopy which keeps the endpoints on @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "let @xmath130 be a proper simple arc on @xmath75 ( proper meaning that it has one endpoint on each boundary component of @xmath75 ) intersecting the core curve of @xmath75 exactly once , and let @xmath131 be the image of @xmath130 under a dehn twist around the core curve of @xmath75 .",
    "then the gluing of @xmath75 to @xmath132 can be done in such a way so that the endpoints of @xmath133 are identified with the endpoints of @xmath11 , @xmath134 .",
    "denote by @xmath135 the simple closed curve comprised of the concatenation of @xmath133 with @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath135 intersects each member of @xmath91 exactly once , and by construction @xmath136 and @xmath137 intersect exactly once .",
    "therefore @xmath138 is a maximal complete @xmath16-system on @xmath139 .",
    "no curves on @xmath41 become isotopic as a result of removing @xmath140 and @xmath141 and gluing on @xmath75 ; therefore the three curves of figure @xmath65 still generate a rank @xmath65 subgroup of @xmath142 , so the intersections of @xmath122 can not be taken to all coincide .",
    "thus @xmath122 is in a distinct mapping class group orbit from @xmath143 .",
    "this process can be repeated to construct @xmath144 which will be distinct from @xmath145 , because again we can find an arc @xmath146 which transversely intersects every member of @xmath122 exactly once . to see this , simply consider a simple arc @xmath147 on @xmath75 with one endpoint on one of the boundary components of @xmath75 , and the other endpoint being the intersection point of @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "we concatenate this arc with a parallel copy of @xmath123 to obtain @xmath146 , and then we proceed as before- gluing on another annulus to obtain @xmath148 and @xmath144 .",
    "we proceed inductively ; assuming that there exists @xmath149 , a simple arc transversely intersecting each member of @xmath150 exactly once , by simply concatenating @xmath149 with @xmath151 we obtain @xmath152 , a simple arc transversely intersecting each member of @xmath153 .",
    "this then allows us to construct @xmath154 , which is in a distinct mapping class group orbit from that of @xmath155 .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem 1.2 ."
