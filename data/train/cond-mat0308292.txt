    "magnetism and superconductivity are manifestations of two different ordered states into which metals can condense at low temperatures . in general these two states are mutually exclusive ; they do not coexist at the same site in the system .",
    "the study of the interplay between these properties has recently been revitalized by the discovery of a family of high-@xmath0 boride carbides rni@xmath9b@xmath9c ( where r is a rare - earth element ) @xcite . the r - c layers separated by ni@xmath9b@xmath9 sheets are antiferromagnetically ordered below a nel temperature @xmath10 , while ni@xmath9b@xmath9 sheets are superconducting below @xmath0 . like rni@xmath9b@xmath9c , pd - metal graphite ( mg )",
    "has a layered structure @xcite . ideally , pd monolayer is sandwiched between adjacent graphite sheets , forming a periodic @xmath11-axis stacking like graphite intercalation compounds ( gic s ) .",
    "each pd layer consists of small islands formed of pd nanoparticles with finite sizes .",
    "pd nanoparticles would generate internal stress inside the graphite lattice , leading to the break up of adjacent graphene sheets into nanographites .",
    "it is expected that the superconductivity occurs in pd sheets and that the antiferromagnetic ( af ) short - range order occurs in nanographites in graphene sheets , leading to a spin glass - like behavior .    in the present work ,",
    "we have undertaken an extensive study on the magnetic properties of pd - mg from various kinds of measurement using squid magnetometer : the dc magnetization in the zero - field cooled ( zfc ) , field - cooled ( fc ) , thermoremnant ( tr ) , and isothermal remnant ( ir ) states , and the ac magnetic susceptibility ( the dispersion and absorption ) .",
    "we show that this compound undergoes a superconducting transition at a critical temperature @xmath0 ( @xmath1 k ) .",
    "the superconductivity occurs in pd sheets . the relaxation of zfc magnetization @xmath12 is also observed below @xmath0 .",
    "it depends on a wait time @xmath5 , a time spent at constant temperature before the magnetic field is applied .",
    "this phenomenon is called aging and has been observed in spin glass ( sg ) systems .",
    "as far as we know , the aging effect has not been observed in usual superconductors .",
    "there is only one exception for a certain bi@xmath9sr@xmath9cacu@xmath9o@xmath13 sample displaying a paramagnetic meissner effect @xcite . in this sense , the aging behavior in pd - mg",
    "is considered to be magnetic but not superconducting in origin .",
    "the fc susceptibility well above @xmath0 obeys a curie - weiss behavior with a negative curie - weiss temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the deviation of the zfc susceptibility from the fc susceptibility starts to occur even at 298 k. these results suggest that an af short - range order appears well above @xmath0 .",
    "based on these results , we propose a model that the superconductivity occurs in pd sheets and that the af short - range order occurs in graphene sheets .",
    "although no long - range magnetic order below @xmath0 has been clearly confirmed from the present work , it is assumed that the possible interplay between the superconductivity and the sg - like behavior becomes significant below @xmath0 .    here",
    "we present experimental and theoretical backgrounds for the origin of the superconductivity in pd sheets and the antiferromagnetism in nanographites .",
    "the absence of superconductivity in pristine pd above 2 mk is mainly due to strong spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "theoretically it is suggested that pd without spin fluctuations should be a superconductor @xcite .",
    "experimentally , stritzker @xcite has reported that pure pd films , evaporated between 4.2 and 300 k , can be transformed into superconductors by means of irradiation at low temperatures with he@xmath15 ions .",
    "the maximum transition temperature obtained is 3.2 k. a special kind of disorder produced by low temperature irradiation may lead to a smearing of the fermi energy @xmath16 , and thus to a reduction of the density of states ( dos ) at @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "this reduction of @xmath17 leads to a decrease in the stoner enhancement factor . as a result",
    ", the strong spin fluctuations would be reduced and superconductivity might be possible .",
    "in fact , meyer and stritzker @xcite have shown that the ac magnetic susceptibility of low - temperature irradiated pd is strongly reduced in comparison to the annealed pd metal .",
    "nanographites are nanometer - sized graphite fragments , forming a new class of mesoscopic system .",
    "fujita et al .",
    "@xcite and wakabayashi et al .",
    "@xcite have theoretically suggested that the electronic structures of finite - size graphene sheets depend crucially on the shape of their edges .",
    "finite graphite systems having zigzag edges exhibit a special edge state .",
    "the corresponding energy bands are almost flat at @xmath16 , giving a sharp peak in @xmath17 .",
    "the conduction electrons localized near the zigzag edge have magnetic moments (= @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "harigaya @xcite has theoretically predicted that the magnetism in nanographites with zigzag edge sites depends on the stacking sequence of nanographites .",
    "the structure of pristine graphite consists of hexagonal net planes of carbon stacked along the @xmath11 axis in a staggered array usually denoted as @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "there is a lateral shift on going from layer @xmath22 to layer @xmath23 .",
    "there are two kinds of spin configurations depending on the stacking of nanographites . for the @xmath22-@xmath23 stacking ,",
    "there is no interlayer interaction at the edge site , giving rise to the af spin alignment .",
    "the growth of af spin order is greatly limited by the disordered nature of nanographites , forming af short - range order .",
    "for the @xmath22-@xmath22 type stacking , on the other hand , the magnetic moment per layer does not appear due to the interlayer interaction .",
    "in a previous work @xcite we have shown that there are two types of pd - mg depending on the reduction condition in the sample preparation : the long - reaction time and the short - reaction time .",
    "the physical properties of these two systems are rather different : the ferromagnetic nature for the long - reaction time and the af nature for the short - reaction time .",
    "the sample used in the present work ( the short - reaction time ) is the same as that used in the previous work @xcite .",
    "pd - mg samples based on natural graphite were prepared by heating pdcl@xmath9 gic with mixed stages ( 2 , 3 , and 4 ) at 350 @xmath24c under hydrogen gas ( flow rate 300 ml per minute ) for 2 hours .",
    "the detail of sample characterization for pd - mg was presented in the previous papers @xcite .",
    "the average size of pd nanoparticles was estimated as ( @xmath25 )  from the bright field transmission electron microscope photograph @xcite .",

    "the raman spectrum shows a large peak at 1580 @xmath26 assigned as the @xmath27 mode in pristine graphite ( 1582 @xmath26 ) , and a small peak at 1360 @xmath26 assigned as the d - band ( disordered induced modes ) of graphite @xcite .",
    "the size of nanographites can be estimated from an empirical law @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the intensities of the corresponding peaks .",
    "in fact , the size of nanographites is on the same order as that of pd nanoparticles .",
    "there is no appreciable charge transfer between nanographites and pd nanoparticles .",
    "the pd - mg sample consists of many small flakes .",
    "each flake has a well - defined @xmath11 axis .",
    "if these flakes are carefully piled inside the sample capsule for the measurement , the @xmath11 axis of the whole sample could correspond to the @xmath11 axis of each flake .",
    "this is not the case for the present experiment .",
    "the present sample may be regarded as a powdered sample with the @xmath11 axis randomly distributed over all directions . because of the small samples , the resistivity measurement could not be carried out .",
    "the mass of the sample used in the present work was 23.8 mg .    the dc magnetization and ac magnetic susceptibility of pd - mg were measured using a squid magnetometer ( quantum design , mpms xl-5 ) . before setting up a sample at 298 k , a remnant magnetic field was reduced to less than 3 moe using an ultra - low - field capability option . for convenience , hereafter this remnant field is denoted as the state @xmath31 = 0 .",
