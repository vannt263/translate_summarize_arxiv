    "aerial robots of very limited cost present robust flight behavior  @xcite , and can be equipped with a multi  modal sensing suite that may contain visible light cameras  @xcite , thermal imaging  @xcite or even light detection and ranging ( lidar ) devices  @xcite and more . at the same time , progress in robotic perception has enabled the online , real  time , @xmath0 reconstruction of the environment  @xcite , tracking of areas and targets of interest  @xcite or even semantic scene understanding  @xcite .",
    "finally , the sucessful combination of modern path planning strategies with the real  time localization and mapping capabilities of the robot has allowed aerial robots to navigate or even explore autonomously in possibly cluttered , challenging and previously unknown environments  @xcite .",
    "aiming to further leverage these outstanding achievements , this work deals with the challenge of using aerial robots to monitor dynamic social phenomena such as parades taking place in our cities .",
    "in particular , we aim to address the problem of optimally coordinating and positioning a team of aerial robots each of them equipped with a camera sensor such that they can provide optimal surveillance of a dynamically evolving parade route taking place within an urban environment .",
    "the parade route is able to change its spatial distribution and form dynamically , the aerial robots are subject ot the limitations of their sensing modules and the goal is to optimize the totally achieved coverage along the parade route . as the parade route is only as well covered as its least  covered point , the optimization objective is to place the aerial robots of the team such that they maximize the minimum coverage over the points in the route at every time instant of it .",

    ", we contribute an algorithm that provides approximate solutions via convexification very fast . to demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm we present a set of simulation studies , while the computational properties of the algorithm are also analyzed .",
    "the rest of this document is organized as follows : section  [ sec : problem ] overviews and details the specific problem considered , while section  [ sec : algorithm ] describes the proposed optimal multi  aerial robot dynamic parade route surveillance algorithm .",
    "subsequently , section  [ sec : sim ] presents detailed simulation results and computational analysis of the algorithm .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawin section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "a dynamic parade following the route trajectory @xmath1 is considered to take place in an urban @xmath2 map , subsets of which are occupied by buildings  obstacles of rectangle shape .",
    "given a set of @xmath3 aerial robots capable of flying holonomic trajectories and a sensor model constrained by a field  of  view @xmath4 , the problem is to find the set of aerial robot trajectories @xmath5 $ ] that _ maximize the minimum coverage _ for every point of @xmath1 . due to its nature as a problem of finding dynamic guard positions to ensure coverage of a desired subset of the environment , this problem is expected to be np  hard .",
    "the inclusion of visibility constraints and obstacles in the environment is then further complicating the effort to derive optimal solutions .",
    "the specifics of the algorithmic approach to solve the problem of optimal dynamic parade route surveillance using a team of aerial robots are provided below .",
    "the dynamic parade is considered to follow the route @xmath1 and its dynamic evolution is sampled every @xmath6 . the time ",
    "trajectory @xmath1 is considered to be constructed via the sequential , piecewise connection of linear segments , an approach that allows to easily model a parade that takes place within an urban environment . for every @xmath7th sample of the route @xmath8 , it is discretized into a set of @xmath9 points @xmath10 .      for the parade route @xmath1 ,",
    "its discretized version @xmath8 per @xmath7th iteration of the algorithm , and considering a team of @xmath3 aerial robots , an equal amount of `` guard positions '' is desired to be computed to optimize the parade coverage .",
    "these guard positions may be selected from an arbitrary large set of possible guard locations @xmath11 ( fixed or varying per iteration ) . for these guard positions ,",
    "the decision variable @xmath12 is defined and becomes @xmath13 if and only if a robot is placed at the @xmath14th location .",
    "associated with each robot location @xmath14 is a coverage vector @xmath15 , which describes how well an aerial robot placed at location @xmath14 would cover each point in the current of the current instance @xmath8 of the parade route . assuming additive coverage , the vector that describes the total coverage of every edge will be defined by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 has @xmath18 as its @xmath14th column .",
    "subsequently , as the parade route is only as secure as its least well  covered point , the optimization problem that deals with how to optimally position the aerial robots for the @xmath7th sample of the route @xmath8 takes the form :    @xmath19    this problem is nonconvex and , in general , np ",
    "hard due to the necessary boolean decision variable in its definition .",
    "this fact necessitates the derivation of methods and approaches that can approximate the optimal solutions efficiently , while presenting superior performance characteristics .",
    "this can be achieved via appropriate relaxations leading to the convexification of the problem  @xcite .      in order to perform an efficient yet accurate convexification of the problem",
    ", we form the following convex _ relaxation _ :    @xmath20    by constraining @xmath21^n$ ] . in general , the solution to this relaxed problem , @xmath22 will have fractional variables  @xcite . as a boolean allocation",
    "is considered in order to specifically assign a guard location to every robot , the _ iterated weighted _ @xmath23 _ heuristic _ will be used to achieve the recovery of a boolean solution  @xcite .      in order to recover a boolean solution ,",
    "an approach is to solve a sequence of convex problems where the linear term @xmath24 is added to the objective , and then picking the weight vector @xmath25 at each iteration to try and induce a sparse solution vector @xmath26 . enhancing sparsity via reweighted @xmath23 optimization is an extensively employed approach in convex optimization .",
    "broadly , given a set @xmath27 and denoting its _ cardinality _ as @xmath28 , the iterated weighted @xmath23 heuristic is the process of minimizing @xmath28 over @xmath29 through the following process :    [ alg : loneheur ]    @xmath30    naturally , this process is extended for the case of matrices , while the matrix rank operator @xmath31 is then acting with the role of the cardinality operator . for the problem of finding solution to the relaxed , convex , problem of section  [ sec : relaxation ] , the iterated @xmath23 heuristic consists of initializing @xmath32 and repeating the two steps :    _ step 1 : _ @xmath33    _ step 2 : _ @xmath34    until a boolean solution is reached . within these expressions , @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "are adjusted to promote a sparse solution .",
    "typical choices would be @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "intuitively , the weight vector @xmath39 is incentivizing elements of @xmath40 which were close to zero in the last iteration towards zero in the next iteration .",
    "it is highlighted that the @xmath23 heuristic is characterized by increased performance as it typically converges within @xmath41 or fewer iterations .",
    "the aforementioned steps provide the solution of placing a team of aerial robots at the optimal guard positions to ensure the best coverage of a fixed instane of the parade route .",
    "as the parade is in fact dynamic , these steps are executed iteratively .",
    "at every step @xmath7 sampled at a possibly varying sampling period @xmath6 the current instance of the route @xmath8 is used and the relevant optimal robot positions are computed .",
    "the reference commands to the robots are then provided to the team on a nearest neighbor fashion .",
    "to verify and evaluate the functionality of the algorithm , a set of simulation studies are considered . within those ,",
    "a @xmath2 city is considered and parades are designed to follow complex trajectories within the city building blocks . at the same time , we varied the number of robots as well as the number of potential guard positions sampled in the environment .",
    "below , a subset of these results will be presented and the computational analysis will be summarized .",

    "sufficient _ number of guard positions is sampled , then further enlargement of this sampling space will not tend to lead to significantly better solutions . on the other hand , computational time increases a lot as shown in figure  [ fig : res_time ] , a fact that further highlights the need for a good prior tuning of the amount of guard positions to be sampled . as the sampling of possible guard positions is uniform however , tuning this value is in general only about having one good reference value for a given environment and then scaling with the surface of free space .",
