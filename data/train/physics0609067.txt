    "the unusual properties of the electromagnetic waves in a medium with simultaneously permittivity @xmath0 and the permeability @xmath1 were firstly introduced by veselago about forty years ago  @xcite .",
    "the waves propagation in such media are quite counterintuitive . for example , the direction of energy flow for a plane wave is opposite to the direction of propagation .",
    "after the first experimental observation using a metamaterial composed of split ring resonators ( srr )  @xcite , the study of such materials has received increasing attention over the last few years . as noted earlier , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are necessarily frequency dispersive in lhm .",
    "since the frequency dispersion is important , the superluminal  @xcite and the subluminal propagation  @xcite in the lhm takes place .",
    "it should be noted that we neglect bianisotropic effects despite the fact that they might be important for the characterization of some rings . while negative refraction is most easily visualized in an isotropic metamaterial , negative refraction",
    "can also be realized in anisotropic metamaterial , which does not necessarily require that all tensor elements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 have negative values  @xcite .",
    "if we just consider the spatial dispersion , the superluminal group velocity can be expected in the amm with hyperboloid dispersion relation  @xcite .",
    "while the real amm constructed by srr is highly dispersive , both in spatial and frequency sense  @xcite , hence it is very necessary to extend the previous work and take the frequency dispersion into account .    in the present letter",
    ", we will investigate the simultaneous slow phase and group velocities of wave packet in an anisotropic metamaterial .",
    "the subluminal phase propagation is induced by the hyperbolic dispersion relations associated with the amm .",
    "we describe a modulated gaussian wave packet incident on the anisotropic metamaterial , which demonstrates in a straightforward manner that the peak of the localized wave packet displays interesting smultaneous slow phase and group velocities .",
    "it is currently well accepted that a better model is to consider anisotropic constitutive parameters , which can be diagonalized in the coordinate system collinear with the principal axes of the metamaterial .",
    "if we take the principal axis as the @xmath4 axis , the permittivity and permeability tensors have the following forms : @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath6,\\label{matrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the relative permittivity and permeability constants in the principal coordinate system ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the real amm constructed by srr is highly dispersive , both in spatial sense and frequency sense  @xcite .",
