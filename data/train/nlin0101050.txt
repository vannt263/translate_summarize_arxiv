    "a traditional approach to the description of fully developed turbulence is based on the stochastic navier - stokes equation @xcite .",
    "the complexity of this equation leads to great difficulties which do not allow one to solve it even in the simplest case when one assumes the isotropy of the system under consideration . on the other hand ,",
    "the isotropic turbulence is almost delusion and if exists is still rather rare .",
    "therefore , if one wants to model more or less realistic developed turbulence , one is pushed to consider anisotropically forced turbulence rather than isotropic one .",
    "this , of course , rapidly increases complexity of the corresponding differential equation which itself has to involve the part responsible for description of the anisotropy .",
    "an exact solution of the stochastic navier - stokes equation does not exist and one is forced to find out some convenient methods to touch the problem at least step by step .",
    "a suitable and also powerful tool in the theory of developed turbulence is the so - called renormalization group ( rg ) method . over the last two decades",
    "the rg technique has widely been used in this field of science and gives answers to some principal questions ( e.g. the fundamental description of the infra - red ( ir ) scale invariance ) and is also useful for calculations of many universal parameters ( e.g. critical dimensions of the fields and their gradiens etc . ) .",
    "a detailed survey of this questions can be found in refs . @xcite and refs . therein .    in early papers ,",
    "the rg approach has been applied only to the isotropic models of developed turbulence .",
    "however , the method can also be used ( with some modifications ) in the theory of anisotropic developed turbulence .",
    "a crucial question immediately arises here , whether the principal properties of the isotropic case and anisotropic one are the same at least at the qualitative level . if they are , then it is possible to consider the isotropic case as a first step in the investigation of real systems . on this way of transition from the isotropic",
    "developed turbulence into the anisotropic one we have to learn whether the scaling regime does remain stable under this transition .",
    "that means , whether the stable fixed points of the rg equations remain stable under the influence of anisotropy .    over the last decade",
    "a few papers have appeared in which the above question has been considered . in some cases",
    "it has been found out that stability really takes place ( see , e.g.@xcite ) . on the other hand , existence of systems without such a stability has been proved too . as has been shown in ref.@xcite , in the anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic developed turbulence a stable regime generally does not exist . in @xcite ,",
    "d - dimensional models with @xmath4 were investigated for two cases : weak anisotropy @xcite and strong one @xcite , and it has been shown that the stability of the isotropic fixed point is lost for dimensions @xmath5 .",
    "it has also been shown that stability of the fixed point even for dimension @xmath6 takes place only for sufficiently weak anisotropy .",
    "the only problem in these investigations is that it is impossible to use them in the case @xmath1 because new ultra - violet ( uv ) divergences appear in the green functions when one considers @xmath1 , and they were not taken into account in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "a correct treatment of the two - dimensional isotropic turbulence has been given .",
    "the correctness in the renormalization procedure has been reached by introduction into the model a new local term ( with a new coupling constant ) which allows one to remove additional uv - divergences . from this point of view",
    ", the results obtained earlier for anisotropical developed turbulence presented in @xcite and based on the paper @xcite ( the results of the last paper are in conflict with @xcite ) can not be considered as correct because they are inconsistent with the basic requirement of the uv - renormalization , namely with the requirement of the localness of the counterterms @xcite .",
    "the authors of the recent paper @xcite have used the double - expansion procedure introduced in @xcite ( this procedure is a combination of the well - known wilson dimensional regularization procedure and the analytical one ) and the minimal substraction ( ms ) scheme @xcite for investigation of developed turbulence with weak anisotropy for @xmath1 . in such a perturbative approach",
    "the deviation of the spatial dimension from @xmath1 , @xmath7 , and the deviation of the exponent of the powerlike correlation function of random forcing from their critical values , @xmath8 , play the role of the expansion parameters .",
    "the main result of the paper was the conclusion that the two - dimensional fixed point is not stable under weak anisotropy .",
    "it means that 2d turbulence is very sensitive to the anisotropy and no stable scaling regimes exist in this case . in the case",
    "@xmath6 , for both the isotropic turbulence and anisotropic one , as it has been mentioned above , existence of the stable fixed point , which governs the kolmogorov asymptotic regime , has been established by means of the rg approach by using the analytical regularization procedure @xcite .",
    "one can make analytical continuation from @xmath1 to the three - dimensional turbulence ( in the same sense as in the theory of critical phenomena ) and verify whether the stability of the fixed point ( or , equivalently , stability of the kolmogorov scaling regime ) is restored . from the analysis made in ref.@xcite it follows that it is impossible to restore the stable regime by transition from dimension @xmath1 to @xmath6 .",
    "we suppose that the main reason for the above described discrepancy is related to the straightforward application of the standard ms scheme . in the standard ms scheme one",
    "works with the purely divergent part of the green functions only , and in concrete calculations its dependence on the space dimension @xmath9 resulting from the tensor nature of these green functions is neglected ( see sect.3 ) . in the case of isotropic models ,",
    "the stability of the fixed points is independent of dimension @xmath10 however , in anisotropic models the stability of fixed points depends on the dimension @xmath9 , and consideration of the tensor structure of feynman graphs in the analysis of their divergences becomes important .    in present paper",
    "we suggest applying modified ms scheme in which we keep the @xmath11dependence of uv - divergences of graphs .",
    "we affirm that after such a modification the @xmath9-dependence is correctly taken into account and can be used in investigation of whether it is possible to restore the stability of the anisotropic developed turbulence for some dimension @xmath12 when going from a two - dimensional system to a three - dimensional one . in the limit of infinitesimally weak anisotropy for the physically most reasonable value of @xmath13 ,",
    "the value of the borderline dimension is @xmath14 below the borderline dimension , the stable regime of the fixed point of the isotropic developed turbulence is lost by influence of weak anisotropy .",
    "it has to be mentioned that a similar idea of `` geometric factor '' was used in ref.@xcite in rg analysis of the burgers - kardar - parisi - zhang equation but the reason to keep the @xmath11dependence of divergent parts of the graphs was to take correctly into account the finite part of one - loop feynman diagrams in the two - loop approximation . in the present paper",
    ", we shall not discuss it in detail because the critical analysis of the results obtained in @xcite was given in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give the quantum field functional formulation of the problem of the fully developed turbulence with weak anisotropy .",
    "the rg analysis is given in section 3 when we discuss the stability of the fixed point obtained under weak anisotropy . in section 4",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "appendix i contains expressions for the divergent parts of the important graphs . at the end ,",
    "appendix ii contains analytical expressions for the fixed point and the equation which describes its stability in the limit of the weak anisotropy .",
    "in this section we give the description of the model .",
    "as has already been discussed in the previous section , we work with fully developed turbulence and assume weak anisotropy of the system .",
    "it means that the parameters that describe deviations from the fully isotropic case are sufficiently small and allow one to forget about corrections of higher degrees ( than linear ) which are made by them .    in the statistical theory of anisotropically developed turbulence",
    "the turbulent flow can be described by a random velocity field @xmath15 and its evolution is given by the randomly forced navier - stokes equation @xmath16 where we assume incompressibility of the fluid , which is mathematically given by the well - known conditions @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in eq.([ns ] ) the parameter @xmath19 is the kinematic viscosity ( hereafter all parameters with subscript @xmath20 denote bare parameters of unrenormalized theory , see below ) , the term @xmath21 is related to anisotropy and will be specified later .",

    "if the dimension of the system is taken @xmath4 , then the physical value of this parameter is @xmath29 ( the so - called energy pumping regime ) .",
    "the situation is more complicated when @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the new integrals of motion arise , namely the enstrophy , and all its powers ( for details see ref.@xcite ) which leads to ambiguity in determination of the inertial range and this freedom is given in the rg method by the value of the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the value @xmath30 corresponds to the so - called enstrophy pumping regime .",
    "this problem of uncertainty can not be solved in the framework of the rg technique . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath8 is not important for stability of the fixed point when @xmath1 .",
    "thus , it is not important , from our point of view , what is the value of @xmath8 in the case @xmath1 .",
    "its value @xmath31 corresponds to a logarithmic perturbation theory for calculation of green functions when @xmath32 , which plays the role of a bare coupling constant of the model , becomes dimensionless .",

    "the tensor @xmath41 given by eq.([d ] ) is the most general form with respect to the condition of incompressibility of the system under consideration and contains two dimensionless free parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 . from the positiveness of the correlator tensor @xmath44 one immediately gets restrictions on the above parameters , namely @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in what follows",
