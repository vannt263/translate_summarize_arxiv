    "the early results from the experiments performed at slac in the kinematic region of high energy transfer(@xmath10 ) and high momentum transfer(@xmath8 ) corresponding to deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) exhibited remarkable phenomenon of bjorken scaling  @xcite . in bjorken scaling , the nucleon structure functions in the asymptotic region of very high @xmath8 are found to be independent of @xmath8 and depend only upon single dimensionless variable @xmath11 instead of otherwise independent variables @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "this @xmath8 independence of nucleon structure functions led to the first evidence that nucleons consist of structureless constituents identified as quarks and gluons .",
    "furthermore , the lepton - nucleon cross sections were found to be incoherent sum of elastic lepton scattering cross section from these structureless constituents confirming the asymptotic freedom predicted by qcd . at lower values of @xmath8 and x , the nucleon structure functions exhibit @xmath8 dependence which is attributed to the violation of bjorken scaling due to higher twist correction in qcd  @xcite .",
    "these higher twist corrections arise due to quark - quark and quark - gluon interactions in the nucleon which play an important role when we move to lower @xmath8 from the asymptotic region in @xmath8 .",
    "the nucleon structure functions in the scaling region of high @xmath8 , and their @xmath8 evolution to lower @xmath8 region are described rather well using the methods of perturbative qcd and evolution equation of dglap  @xcite .    in the case of deep inelastic lepton scattering from nuclear targets ,",
    "the nuclear structure functions per nucleon are found to be quite different from the nucleon structure functions as discovered by the emc effect first observed at cern  @xcite and confirmed by many experiments thereafter  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these modifications in the nucleon structure function are due to the nuclear medium effects like fermi motion , binding energy , nucleon correlations , mesonic contributions , etc .",
    "these are in addition to higher twist effects in qcd for nucleons and mesons in nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear medium effects in the dis region are divided into four parts which are broadly identified in terms of bjorken scaling variable @xmath12 .",

    "r _ which has been found to be independent of the nucleon number @xmath15 . shadowing and anti - shadowing effects are attributed respectively due to the constructive and destructive interference of amplitudes arising from the multiple scattering of quarks inside the nucleus , ( iii ) the emc effect which is a large suppression in a wide range of @xmath12(@xmath17 ) , and is broadly understood as due to the modification of nucleon structure functions in nuclei , and ( iv ) the binding energy and the fermi motion effect which is effective for @xmath18 and this arises due to the fact that the nucleons in a nucleus are moving with an average momentum @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the fermi momentum .    in the dis region ,",

    "for the numerical calculations we have used eq.([conv_wa1 ] ) for @xmath31 and eq.([had_ten151 ] ) for @xmath32 . the contributions of @xmath188 and @xmath189 mesons have been taken into account using eq.([abcf1 ] ) for @xmath232 , eq.([pion_f21 ] ) for @xmath233 , eq.([f2rho ] ) for @xmath234 and eq.([f2rho1 ] ) for @xmath235 .",
    "we have added the mesonic contributions to the nucleonic contribution to get the full result .",
    "it should be mentioned that all the parameters entering in the above mentioned equations have been fixed by our earlier  @xcite works and have not been taken as free parameters .",
    "we have used cteq parameterization  @xcite for the quark / antiquark pdfs for nucleon and the quark / antiquark parameterization for pion from the works of gluck et al .",
    "@xcite . for the rho meson",
    "we have taken the same pdfs as for the pion . moreover , while determining nucleon structure functions in terms of parton distribution functions , it is important to include target mass correction(tmc ) to take into account the effects associated with the non - zero mass of the target .",
    "tmc effects are more pronounced at large x and moderate @xmath8 .",
    "we have taken into account the target mass correction following the works of schienbein et al .",
    "the shadowing effect has been incorporated following ref .",
    "@xcite and is pronounced at low x(x@xmath1860.1 ) .",
    "therefore , in the present studied region of x(@xmath236 ) the effect of shadowing is almost negligible and the results for this are not explicitly shown in all the figures .",
    "the results are presented for different cases .",
    "the first case is when we take the contribution of nucleon spectral function only i.e. eq.([conv_wa1 ] ) for @xmath31 and eq.([had_ten151 ] ) for @xmath32 , which includes the effect of fermi motion , nuclear binding and nucleon correlations , and perform the calculation at the leading order(lo ) .",
    "the numerical results are referred as lo(sf ) .",
    "we then include the contribution from meson clouds as well as shadowing effect and this we call as the results of our full model .",
    "this we refer as lo(total ) .",
    "these results have also been obtained at nlo for both the cases .",
    "the results in these cases are referred as nlo(sf ) and nlo(total ) , respectively .    in fig.[figf2_all ] , we have presented the results for @xmath237 in various nuclear targets like @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath182 at different @xmath8 . we find that in @xmath3 at @xmath238 , the results obtained using full model at lo , is about 18@xmath207 higher at x=0.2 in comparison to the results obtained using spectral function only .",
    "this difference decreases with the increase in x , for example at x=0.4 , it is 12@xmath207 and becomes almost negligible at x=0.6 .",
    "we observe that this difference increases with the increase in mass number i.e. for @xmath4 , it is @xmath239 20@xmath207 higher at x=0.2 and 14@xmath207 at x=0.4 , while in @xmath5 it is @xmath239 23@xmath207 higher at x=0.2 and 17@xmath207 at x=0.4 . in @xmath240(not",
    "shown in the figure ) this difference becomes about 25@xmath207 at x=0.2 and 18@xmath207 at x=0.4 , whereas in @xmath29 ( not shown in the figure ) this difference increases to 26@xmath207 at x=0.2 and 20@xmath207 at x=0.4 .",
    "the difference is mainly due to mesonic effects and is negligible for @xmath241 for the nuclei considered here . when the results obtained by using the full model at nlo are compared with the results evaluated at lo , we find that the results decrease from the lo values .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath3 , it is lower by 10@xmath207 at x=0.2 and 5@xmath207 at x=0.4 . then there is a cross over around x=0.5 and beyond that it increases with increase in x. for example , it is around 35 - 38@xmath207 larger at x=0.8 for the nuclei considered here .",
    "the effect of shadowing has been found to be almost negligible in the presently studied region of x. for example , the effect of shadowing is around 1 - 2@xmath207 at x@xmath2390.2 in @xmath3 which increases to 2 - 3@xmath207 for heavier nuclei like @xmath240 and @xmath29 .",
    "we have also shown in this figure , jlab experimental data  @xcite and find that our results obtained with full model at nlo agree reasonably well with the jlab data .    in fig.[figq2var_all ] , we present the results for @xmath242 obtained using eqs.([conv_wa1 ] ) , ( [ abcf1 ] ) and ( [ f2rho ] ) . the results are presented with full model at lo and nlo in several nuclei like @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath182 at various values of @xmath8 .",
    "we find that in general these results are qualitatively similar in nature to that found in the case of @xmath243 , however , quantitatively there is some variation , specially in the region of low x where mesonic effects play a role .",
    "the results are also compared with the jlab data  @xcite and we find a reasonable agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we separately show the effect of mesonic contribution and shadowing effect in @xmath244 and @xmath237 , by presenting the results for @xmath245,(i=1,2 ) in fig.[fignew1 ] .",
    "these results are shown in @xmath5 , where @xmath246 stands for the results obtained for the nuclear structure functions using the spectral function only while @xmath247 is the result obtained when we include ( i ) mesonic(@xmath248 ) contributions and ( ii ) mesonic(@xmath248 ) contributions and shadowing effects . at low @xmath8",
    ", we find that the mesonic contributions are larger which become smaller with the increase in @xmath8 .",
    "for example , at @xmath238 , the mesonic contribution is 24 - 28@xmath207 at x=0.2 , which becomes 2 - 4@xmath207 at x=0.6 .",
    "similarly at @xmath249(not shown in the figure ) , the mesonic contribution is found to be 20 - 24@xmath207 at x=0.2 , which becomes 1 - 2@xmath207 at x=0.6 .",
    "we also find that the mesonic contributions to @xmath237 at a given x and @xmath8 is larger than the mesonic contribution in @xmath244 over the whole range of x and @xmath8 .",
    "the results presented in figs.[figf2_all ] and [ figq2var_all ] for @xmath237 and @xmath242 give useful predictions for @xmath250 at low x , which may be tested in future experiments .",
    "it may be observed that the mesonic contributions are really different for @xmath244 and @xmath237 structure functions and when shadowing contributions are included both curves get reduced because the shadowing goes in the opposite direction to the enhancement due to meson cloud contribution and this can be viewed as a kind of compensating effect .    in fig.[figflq2var_all ] , we present the results for the longitudinal structure function @xmath251 using the full model at lo as well as at nlo .",
    "here we have also shown the results with the spectral function only , obtained at nlo .",
    "these results are presented for various nuclear targets like @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath182 at different @xmath8 .",
    "we find that mesonic contributions to @xmath251 are quite large at low x and @xmath8 and becomes negligible for @xmath252 for almost all values of @xmath8 studied here .",
    "for example , in @xmath3 at @xmath253 , the mesonic contributions is @xmath254 ( of total @xmath251 ) at x=0.2 which reduces to @xmath255 at x=0.5 .",
    "the mesonic contributions increases for all x(x @xmath186 0.6 ) with the increase in mass number as we go from @xmath3 to @xmath182 as shown in fig.[figflq2var_all ] .",
    "thus the results presented in this figure are also an equivalent proof of the fact that the mesonic contributions to @xmath244 and @xmath237 are really different .",
    "this is because , in principle , @xmath256 should be zero if callan - gross relationship were exactly fulfilled .",
    "while the nucleonic contributions(sf only ) of @xmath257 and @xmath258 show a more prominent trend to cancel while computing @xmath259 , whereas the mesonic contributions when added to it leads to a significant behaviorial change which results in a broken callan - gross relation(compare the curve shown by the dotted lines to the curve shown by the solid line in fig.[figflq2var_all ] ) .",
    "the results at nlo are larger than lo for @xmath260 and are in better agreement with the experimental results for @xmath251 for jlab  @xcite .",
    "however , there are some exceptions specially at low @xmath8 ( @xmath261 ) as seen in the case of @xmath262al and @xmath263fe . at smaller @xmath8 in the region of @xmath264",
    ", the non - perturbative qcd effects and their possible enhancement in nuclear medium may play an important role which are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however the present work makes important prediction for @xmath251 in lower x region which may be tested in future experiments .",
    "we present the results for @xmath265 and @xmath266 in fig.[fig118sn ] , using the spectral function and the full model at nlo and compared the results with nmc data  @xcite .",
    "we find that the results are in better agreement with the experimental observations when mesonic contributions are included in addition to the nuclear medium effects .",
    "we find a strong nuclear dependence as the absolute values of the slope increases with the increase in the mass number .",
    "this may be noted that although mesonic cloud contributions seem to be very different for @xmath244 and @xmath237 separately , they also seem to cancel when computing the ratios between structure functions for different nuclei .",
    ";  i=1,2 .",
    "experimental points are the nmc result  @xcite.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    to conclude , we have studied nuclear medium effects in electromagnetic nuclear structure functions @xmath244 and @xmath237 , and the longitudinal structure function @xmath251 . for the nuclear medium effects , we took into account fermi motion , nuclear binding , nucleon correlations , effect of meson degrees of freedom , etc .",
    "the calculations are performed both at lo and nlo .",
    "the theoretical expressions for @xmath267 and @xmath243 have been obtained without assuming callan - gross relation at nuclear level but it has been assumed at nucleonic(and mesonic ) level while computing @xmath268 and @xmath269 for free nucleons and mesons .",
    "the theoretical results are then compared with the experimental data for @xmath244 , @xmath237 , @xmath256 from jlab data  @xcite and found in good agreement with them ( for x @xmath270 0.4 ) except for @xmath271 at very low @xmath272 .",

    "<S> recent experiments performed on inclusive electron scattering from nuclear targets have measured the nucleon electromagnetic structure functions @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements have been done in the energy region of @xmath7 and @xmath8 region of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated nuclear medium effects in these structure functions arising due to the fermi motion , binding energy , nucleon correlations , mesonic contributions from pion and rho mesons and shadowing effects . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are performed in a local density approximation using a relativistic nucleon spectral function which includes nucleon correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are compared with the recent experimental data from jlab and also with some earlier experiments . </S>"
