    "the trapping of two different species of ultracold gases has been an active topic of research for about ten years ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and has led to the simultaneous production of quantum degenerate bose - einstein and fermi - dirac gases @xcite and recently to the observation of heteronuclear feshbach resonances involving bose - einstein and fermi - dirac species @xcite .",
    "two recent experiments @xcite provide a glimpse of the possibilities of mapping out the phase diagram of a bose - einstein / fermi - dirac mixture , potentially a rich system that remains to be explored .",
    "our present work provides accurate estimates of the trapping frequencies of disparate species confined in the same optical trap .",
    "we have been attentive to finding cases in which all species , bose - einstein and fermi - dirac atoms , and the molecules formed from them , have the same trapping frequencies .",
    "this case is of particular interest because it has been shown to be optimal for a recently proposed scheme of cooling mediated by feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "in addition , we note that while the dc polarizabilities of alkali atoms have been subject to careful experimental investigation , there is relatively little accurate experimental data on frequency - dependent polarizabilities .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that current experiments offer the possibility of measurements of unprecedented accuracy regarding the ratio of frequency - dependent polarizabilities of different species .",
    "such measurements could provide more decisive comparison of _ ab initio _ atomic theory with experiments , than has been made to date .",
    "we begin with a summary of the calculation of frequency - dependent polarizabilities , the details of which have been presented in previous publications @xcite .",
    "the computational method we use here has delivered agreement with experiments on static polarizabilities at the 1% level .",
    "there are few direct measurements of frequency - dependent polarizabilities - the experiments are much more demanding , and have larger uncertainties associated with modeling the intensity profile of a focused laser beam . however , the alkali metal atoms are a special case , at least in the infrared spectral region . there , the polarizability is dominated by the contribution from the longest - wavelength resonance transitions , and it is possible to perform consistency checks between static values and long - wavelength values of the frequency - dependent atomic polarizabilities .",
    "we present tabulated values of calculated frequency - dependent polarizabilities over a range of wavelengths from the ultraviolet through the infrared spectrum , with particular attention to those wavelengths ( primarily in the infrared ) which have been or might be employed in the present generation of optical traps . for the infrared region ,",
    "we display simple formulae that allow accurate computation of frequency - dependent polarizabilities for wavelengths not explicitly reported upon here .    finally , we enumerate selected wavelengths , at which two species of optically - trapped alkali atoms would have the same frequencies of oscillation in a common optical trap .",
    "such wavelengths offer opportunities for mapping out phase diagrams of bose - einstein and fermi - dirac mixtures in a space of reduced dimensionality .",
    "moreover , to the extent that molecular resonances consist of weakly bound states at large internuclear separation , the oscillation frequencies of trapped molecular species should be very close to the frequencies of their atomic components .",
    "this may present an ideal system for investigation .",
