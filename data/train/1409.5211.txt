    "an adiabatic cycle , where an external parameter of a system is varied infinitely slowly along a closed path , may induce a nontrivial change , which is sometimes referred to as an anholonomy .",
    "a famous example is the geometric phase in stationary states  @xcite .",
    "this is also called as a phase holonomy , which is derived from the interpretation in terms of the differential geometry  @xcite .",
    "besides the phase of state vector , it turned out that ( quasi-)eigenenergies and eigenspaces of stationary states of a closed quantum system may exhibit anholonomies  @xcite .",
    "we call such a change an exotic quantum holonomy",
    ".    a more precise description of the exotic quantum holonomy is the following .",
    "suppose that a system is initially in a stationary state , and undergo a unitary time evolution induced by an adiabatic cycle .",
    "the final state of the system is orthogonal to the initial state . in accordance to the correspondence between eigenstates and eigenenergies , the trajectory of the eigenenergy",
    "connects two different eigenenergies of the initial system . in other words , the adiabatic cycle interchanges the eigenspaces and eigenenergies  @xcite .",
    "note that the exotic quantum holonomy is different from wilczek - zee s holonomy  @xcite , since the former occurs even when there is no spectral degeneracy .",
    "also note that the exotic quantum holonomy is different from the interchange , or the flip , of eigenvectors induced by a cycle around a non - hermitian degeneracy point  @xcite , which is known as kato s exceptional point ( ep )  @xcite , in spite of their resemblance explained below .",
    "this is because the decay due to the non - hermiticity makes the stringent limitation to observe the flip in the adiabatic limit  @xcite .",
    "namely , the flip due to eps is observable only in the non - unitary time evolution whose timescale is shorter than the relevant lifetimes in the unstable system , and , in the parametric evolution  @xcite .",
    "the earliest example of the exotic quantum holonomy is the one - dimensional particle under a generalized point potential  @xcite .",
    "since then , examples are found in quantum maps  @xcite , quantum circuits  @xcite , and quantum graphs  @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that the lieb - liniger model  @xcite , which describes one - dimensional bose systems , exhibits the exotic quantum holonomy along a cycle made of the confinement induced resonance  @xcite , whose experimental realization should be feasible within the current state of the art  @xcite . as an application , an acceleration of the adiabatic quantum computation",
    "was examined  @xcite .",
    "there are several theoretical works on the exotic quantum holonomy .",
    "firstly , fujikawa s gauge theoretical formulation for the phase holonomy  @xcite is extended so as to incorporate the eigenspace anholonomy , which is understood as a holonomy of basis vectors  @xcite .",
    "secondly , viennot proposed another gauge theoretical formulation based on the adiabatic floquet theory , where the nontrivial floquet block change is discussed in terms of gerbes  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the exotic quantum holonomy is associated to the state flip induced by eps through the generalized fujikawa formalism  @xcite . here",
    "the analytic continuation of a hermitian ( or unitary ) adiabatic cycle provides non - hermitian cycles , which relate the riemann surface structure of eigenenergies  @xcite to the exotic quantum holonomy .    in spite of these efforts ,",
    "there still remain puzzling points on the nature of the exotic quantum holonomy .",
    "firstly , the eigenspace anholonomy and the phase holonomy are mixed in the generalized fujikawa formalism , and there is only an ad hoc procedure to disentangle them  @xcite . also , it is not straightforward to extract the geometrical picture from the generalized fujikawa formalism .",
    "although a solution to this problem is given by simon s formulation as for the phase holonomy  @xcite , there has been no known counterpart of the simon s formulation for the exotic quantum holonomy .",
    "secondly , viennot s theory is for periodically driven systems and , is not applicable to the examples of the exotic quantum holonomy in autonomous ( hamiltonian ) systems  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the association of the exotic quantum holonomy to the non - hermitian degeneracy requires the analyticity of the adiabatic parameter .",
    "however , it is easy to construct the examples that lack the analyticity  @xcite .",
    "hence the ep interpretation of the exotic quantum holonomy is applicable only to a limited class of examples .    in this manuscript",
    ", we introduce a topological formulation of the exotic quantum holonomy , in particular the eigenspace anholonomy , to clarify these problems .",
    "this enables us to identify the quantity that predicts whether a given cycle exhibits the eigenspace anholonomy .",
    "the first key concept in our approach is _ the ordered set of eigenprojectors_. we regard the eigenspace anholonomy as a permutation , which is induced by an adiabatic cycle , among the elements of the ordered set of eigenprojectors .",
    "this may be considered as a counterpart to simon s vector bundle formulation of the phase holonomy  @xcite . in a two - level system",
    ", we show that a permutation occurs only when the adiabatic cycle encloses a singular point odd times .",
    "the second key concept in our topological formulation is _ the cycles in a quantum dynamical variable _ that takes the place of conventional cycles in adiabatic parameters .",
    "it is shown that the topological nature of the eigenspace anholonomy has a direct link with the homotopy classification of cycles  @xcite .",
    "for example , the singular point mentioned above may be called a disclination , or line defect  @xcite . furthermore ,",
