    "charm and beauty production in proton - proton collisions at the lhc is an important tool to test pqcd calculations in a new energy domain .",
    "their spectra in heavy - ion interactions are influenced by the formation of hot and dense qcd matter . due to their relative large mass and the difference between quark and gluon color charge ,",
    "the medium effects for heavy flavor hadrons differ from those of light hadrons .",
    "rhic results show that they effectively lose energy in the medium through ( elastic and/or inelastic ) interactions , but a possible quark - mass hierarchy has not yet been elucidated .",
    "lhc measurements at higher energies , with larger cross sections and better capabilities to separate charm and beauty production , can help to answer these questions .",
    "open heavy flavor production can be measured with the alice experiment at the lhc in different colliding systems .",

    "in heavy - ion collisions , the influence of the hot and dense qcd matter on the produced particles is commonly evaluated by comparing particle production in proton  proton ( pp ) and nucleus  nucleus ( aa ) collisions .",
    "it is usually presented in the form of the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath4 ) : @xmath8 the ratio between the invariant yield in aa collisions ( @xmath9 ) , and the pp cross section ( @xmath10 ) normalized by the average nuclear overlap function , is defined as the convolution of the colliding ions nuclear density profiles , and it is evaluated in the glauber model .",

    "the selection of @xmath0 @xmath23 and @xmath1 @xmath24 candidates was based on the reconstruction of their secondary vertex topologies .",
    "typical selection variables were : the candidate decay length , the distance and angles of the decay products , and the minimum @xmath25 of the decay products . in the @xmath2 meson case , the decay @xmath0 secondary vertex topology was reconstructed .",
    "the selection cut values vary for each meson and @xmath25 bin , and were defined in order to have a large statistical significance of the signal and keep the selection efficiency as high as possible . the decay pions and kaons",

    "no particle identification was required to the pions associated with @xmath0 candidates .",
    "acceptance and reconstruction efficiencies were evaluated with monte carlo simulations of minimum - bias  collisions produced with the hijing v1.36 event generator .",

    "a detailed description of the apparatus geometry and response , the experimental conditions , and their evolution with time was included .",
    "prompt d meson yields were obtained by subtracting the contribution of d mesons from b decays .",
    "it was evaluated using the beauty cross sections from fonll  @xcite calculations , the b@xmath28d decay kinematics from the evtgen package  @xcite and the monte carlo efficiencies for feed - down d mesons .",
    "this contribution was renormalized by the average nuclear overlap function in each centrality class , and the nuclear modification factor of feed - down d mesons ( @xmath29 ) . to perform the correction ,",
