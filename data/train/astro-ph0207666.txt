    "it is generally now accepted that the afterglow emission resulting from ( long - duration , soft - spectrum ) gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) can be explained by an ultra - relativistic shock - wave expanding into a surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "the precise nature of the progenitor systems is not a settled issue .",
    "the two most popular theories both involve stellar remnants : the collapsar / hypernova model , in which a single massive progenitor star undergoes core collapse @xcite ; and the binary merger theory , in which two massive stellar remnants , such as neutron stars , merge @xcite . both of these scenarios may be able to explain the energetics of the explosion that produces the grbs , particularly if they are beamed , since the energies of grbs are comparable to those involved in the formation of typical stellar - progenitor black holes .",
    "recently , the collapsar / hypernova model has gained support from three sets of observations : firstly , it was confirmed that the positions of some grbs accurately localized by the observation of optical and/or radio afterglows , were found to be within star - forming regions of their host galaxies @xcite , which themselves are frequently starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is supported by x - ray determinations of the hi column density along the line of sight to grbs , which is consistent with their residing in grbs @xcite . during their creation",
    ", it is likely that the massive stellar remnants required in the binary merger scenario would receive a substantial ` kick ' velocity , so that the merger event causing the grb would take place outside of the star - forming region of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "also , the delay required between formation of the remnants and their merger may well be long enough for star formation to have ceased in the host , suggesting that the host galaxy would no longer be luminous .",
    "hence the position measurements of @xcite support the single massive progenitor theory .",
    "note though , that one should be wary of a potential selection effect : the detection of a grb afterglow requires a certain minimum density in the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , and so grbs may only be identifiable when they occur inside galaxies @xcite .    secondly , in a few cases , optical afterglows of grbs have been seen to contain a secondary brightening in flux after a few weeks @xcite .",
    "this flux increase , though often not very significant , has been attributed to a supernova occurring simultaneously with the grb , although alternative ideas have been postulated , such as dust echoes @xcite or interactions of the grb shock wave with wind - driven density structures in the surrounding ism @xcite .",
    "supernovae associated with grbs are compatible with the single progenitor collapsar / hypernova model rather than the merger hypothesis .",
    "finally , the detection of iron features in the x - ray afterglows suggest the presence of an iron - enriched ism surrounding the grb progenitor @xcite . this high iron mass is consistent with ejecta from a massive stellar progenitor",
    ".    if the hypernova theory is the correct explanation for long - duration grbs , then there should be a direct link between grbs and high - mass star formation activity .",
    "since the gamma - ray emission from the initial explosion is not attenuated by dust , and can be detected from high redshifts , grbs should be unbiased tracers pointing to star formation activity wherever massive stars are living and dying @xcite .      since the commissioning of the scuba instrument @xcite in 1997 on the jcmt on mauna kea , a new era of submillimetre ( submm ) cosmology has been possible ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the discovery of a substantial population of dust - enshrouded ` scuba galaxies ' has launched a debate regarding observational estimates of the global star formation rate in the universe .",
    "scuba traces the interstellar dust in galaxies ( with a temperature of the order of tens of degrees kelvin ) , which may be heated by the uv light emitted by ob stars and/or a hosted agn .",
    "the relative contributions of starlight and agn to dust - heating in a particular galaxy are hard to determine precisely , but studies using _ chandra _ to observe hard x - rays from submm - selected galaxies suggest that about 20 per cent of the sample contain a detectable agn @xcite .    therefore , it is likely that the luminous dust emission from scuba galaxies is powered predominantly by star formation . in this case , because of the large bolometric luminosities of the scuba galaxies ( at least @xmath1 ) , they make a substantial contribution to overall star formation activity in the high - redshift universe , comparable to or greater than that of optically - selected galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , they are good candidates to be hosts of many grbs , if grbs are indeed associated with the death of high - mass stars . the optical properties of scuba galaxies , where they are well - located , indicate that most are very faint , with @xmath2 @xcite , not dissimilar to the grb host galaxy population as a whole @xcite .",
    "it is likely that about 1020 per cent of the star - formation activity in the high - redshift universe takes place in submm galaxies brighter than 2mjy . as a result",
    ", perhaps 1 in 5 grbs should reside in such objects .",
    "this point is examined further in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "this paper describes our submm scuba observations of the host galaxies of four grbs . to increase the chances of finding dusty scuba galaxies in this pilot program , we selected grbs which were ` dark ' in the sense that their afterglows were undetected in the optical despite deep , rapid searches .",
    "estimates vary , but optical afterglows have been searched for and not found in roughly 30 - 50 per cent of grbs with x - ray afterglows . in many cases",
    "the non - detection may simply be because the searches were not deep or rapid enough ( galama & wijers 2001 ) , but in some instances it is clear that the optical afterglows are genuinely underluminous ( groot et al .",
    "1998 , van paradijs et al .",
    "2000 , lazzati et al .",
    "2001a , ramirez - ruiz et al . 2002 ) .",
    "an obvious possibility is that these bursts are heavily obscured by dust .",
    "since grbs are expected to destroy any dust in their vicinity @xcite , the obscuration would have to be due to dust elsewhere along the line of sight , as might well be expected in very dusty submm - bright galaxies .",
    "note that we did not attempt to observe grb afterglows in the submm .",
    "target of opportunity programs to observe grb afterglows are underway at the jcmt and iram 30-m telescopes @xcite .",
    "our observations took place long enough after the initial explosion for only the host galaxy emission to be detectable .",
    "there have been two previous scuba detections of a grb host galaxy .",
    "the first was found serendipitously during a submm afterglow search @xcite for a grb that had an optical afterglow ( grb 010222 ) .",
    "this suggests that the grb was located in a luminous dusty galaxy , but either in a relatively dust - free region or near the edge of the galaxy , so that the explosion could clear out any dust along the line of sight . also , @xcite reported the results of a successful targeted search for submm emission from grb 000418 .",
    "this too had an optical transient identification .",
    "another relevant detection was that of a grb host in the radio ( grb 980703 ; @xcite ) , whose flux was claimed to be caused by a large star - formation rate rather than agn activity , based on optical spectroscopy and the absence of radio variability .",
    "however , a deeply embedded agn within a dust- and gas - rich galaxy could plausibly contribute the emission from this galaxy , especially as the radio source is located very near to the nucleus of the host galaxy .",
    "observations were made using the 850-@xmath0 photometry pixel on the scuba array @xcite .",
    "they are summarized in table [ obstable ] .",
    "simultaneous observations were made with the 450-@xmath3 photometry pixel , but weather conditions and/or array noise were never good enough to yield useful data .",
    "observations were made in the standard photometry mode , using a 7 hz , 60  ` chop ' in azimuth to provide a blank - sky reference and a further telescope ` nod ' to produce a measure of any sky gradient .",
    "each set of photometry observations takes 18 seconds .",
    "column 3 of table 1 shows the integration time on - source for each grb . pointing",
    "was checked regularly and was always better than 2.5 , much smaller than the primary beam of the array of 14at 850 @xmath0 .",
    "seeing was monitored , especially around dawn and dusk , and data was only taken when the seeing was less than 1 .",
    "sky transparency was calculated by interpolating between regular skydip values , though the situation was monitored more frequently with data from the jcmt s water vapour monitor .",
    "the average sky opacity at 850 @xmath0 during each source s observations , @xmath4 , is given in column 4 of table 1 .",
    "for flux calibration , identical observations were made of the planets mars and uranus , and where necessary the secondary flux calibrator crl 618 .",
    "we found no significant deviations between the observed and expected fluxes of these standard objects .",
    "unfortunately , since the observations were made , two of the grbs in our sample have been found to have been wrongly located : grbs 001109 and 001025 . in the case of grb 001109 ,",
    "the radio - located position which we observed is now thought to correspond to a faint constant radio source @xcite , and thus to be a mis - identification of the grb afterglow .",
    "we detected a net positive flux of @xmath5 mjy from this source , consistent with its likely identification as a high - redshift star - forming galaxy @xcite .",
    "for grb 001025 , _ xmm _ error box s1 was observed , since it contained a candidate host galaxy ( hjorth priv .",
    "comm . ) , but subsequently hurley ( priv . comm . )",
    "has calculated that this error box lies outside a revised _ ipn _ annulus .",
    "hence the results of the observations of both these objects are not included in the rest of this paper .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ restable ]    models for the evolution of the star formation rate in dusty galaxies can be used to predict the likely 850-@xmath3 fluxes of grb hosts @xcite , as shown in fig.[figpred ] .",
    "we assume that : dust in scuba galaxies is predominantly heated by high - mass stars ; grb rates are tied to the rate of formation of high - mass stars ; and most high - redshift star formation activity is enshrouded by dust .",
    "results for two models based on infrared and submm data are presented , a simple parametric model of the evolution of low - redshift galaxies ( bsik : @xcite ) and a model based on luminous hierarchical merging of galaxies ( bjslki : @xcite ) .",
    "these models both provide a good representation of the evolution of dusty galaxies , measured in other observations .",
    "about 20 per cent of _ all _ grb host galaxies are expected to have fluxes above the scuba confusion limit for detection of 2mjy ; about 10 per cent are expected to have fluxes greater than 5mjy . in general",
    ", we predict an average across _ all _ sources of 0.9mjy .",
    "the solid histogram shows the result of our observations , and the dotted histograms define the @xmath6 errors in flux .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ figpred ] that the errors on our results are consistent with the predictions of the galaxy evolution models , and that the overall mean flux is within @xmath7 of the expected value .",
    "grb 000210 is clearly our best candidate for a detection , but only at a significance of about @xmath8 .",
    "however , observations of grb 000210 suffered from the raised array noise discussed in section [ sec : data ] , and from its low elevation from mauna kea . hence , the atmospheric noise for grb 000210 was greater than for our other sources .",
    "note that we purposefully chose a selection bias that should have increased our chances of finding dusty grb hosts , by observing ` dark bursts ' .",
    "since we did not see any increase in our detection rate , alternative explanations are necessary for the lack of optical afterglow detections .",
    "we now look briefly at the four reliable grbs in our sample in more depth .",
    "three early candidates for the optical afterglow of grb 981226 @xcite were rejected upon the location of a radio afterglow @xcite .",
    "the limit on the optical afterglow is therefore r @xmath9 23.5 at 10 hours after the alert @xcite .",
    "later hst / stis and vla imaging has located the probable host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the multi - wavelength afterglow emission from grb 981226 provides some clues .",
    "the x - ray afterglow was found to have a double - peaked structure followed by a rapid decay @xcite . also , @xcite noted a rapid decline in the radio afterglow .",
    "taken together , the x - ray , optical and radio afterglow behaviour may all be explained by a complicated density structure in the ism around the grb . in particular , a cavity in the ism density would explain the rapid x - ray and radio decays , and would predict a similarly fast optical decay , meaning that the optical afterglow searches were too slow / shallow to detect the emission .",
    "such a structure could be produced by the mass loss phases that massive stars ( which are of course plausible grb progenitors ) are known to go through in their post main sequence lives @xcite .",
    "hence , there may be no need to infer the presence of dust around this grb .",
    "other suggestions for rapid decays have been proposed which also do not rely on the presence of dust , such as the effects of jet structure @xcite .",
    "our non - detection is consistent with the brief weather - affected scuba afterglow search for this grb by @xcite .",
    "grb 990506 appears to have some similarities with grb 981226 .",
    "again it had a very rapidly decaying radio transient @xcite .",
    "the optical transient was not detected at r = 19 after 1 hour @xcite , nor to r = 23.5 after 11 hours @xcite .",
    "the rapid decay of the radio afterglow again suggests that a non - dusty effect , local to the burst , may explain the absence of an optical afterglow .",
    "optical searches for the host have identified it as a very faint and compact galaxy @xcite .",
    "grb 970828 was dark to a depth of r = 23.8 @xcite in observations taken from 4hrs after the burst .",
    "a radio flash was observed by the vla @xcite and has been interpreted as reverse shock emission .",
    "no conventional radio afterglow was detected .",
    "subsequent keck and _ hst _ observations of the location of the radio flare revealed an interacting three - component host @xcite , with a possible identification of the grb location in a dust lane between the two brightest components . in calculations considering both jet and spherical models for the grb shock geometry ,",
    "djorgovski et al . (",
    "2001 ) conclude , based on the x - ray afterglow flux , that a single typical giant molecular cloud could provide all the extinction necessary to fit the upper limits to the optical afterglow flux density .",
    "they also note that the keck and _ hst _",
    "images indicate that the two host galaxy components on either side of the grb location are both slightly but not highly reddened , suggesting a low total dust mass in the system .",
    "our positive but not significant measurement supports the hypothesis that in this case at least , it was not galaxy - wide dust that caused the obscuration of the optical afterglow , but rather a localized cloud or clouds of dust along the line - of - sight , consistent with the x - ray results .",
    "of course , scuba s resolution is such that our observations are sensitive only to the total ( illuminated ) dust in the entire system .",
    "grb 000210 represents our most likely host galaxy detection .",
    "both x - ray and radio transients were found for this source , but no optical transient ( r @xmath9 23.5 at 12.4 hours after the burst , @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray transient did not display the rapid decays found for grbs 981226 and 990506 , leading piro et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to reject the no - dust hypotheses discussed above .",
    "instead they conclude that the most likely scenarios are either obscuration of the optical transient by a clumpy local environment , or line - of - sight obscuration by the whole host galaxy , either of which is allowed by our findings .",
    "from our small sample of four reliably - identified dark grbs , we find that the ` dark bursts ' do not preferentially select dusty host galaxies with very significant amounts of star formation . looking at some members of our sample , we can explain the lack of optical transients for other reasons .",
    "it seems likely that to characterise the optically dark bursts as a physically distinct population of grbs would be misleading . in each case",
    "different circumstances due to a combination of the observing conditions and the physical conditions at the location of the grb could give rise to the lack of an optical afterglow . if , instead , we view the grbs included here as four examples of the overall population , we find that the results agree with the distribution predicted assuming that grbs tracew high - mass star formation .",
    "our lack of a single strong detection implies that no more than 20 per cent of grb hosts are submm galaxies detectable at a flux density brighter than 5mjy using scuba . in interpreting the results",
    ", however , the small sample size inevitably makes it hard to draw any solid conclusions .    combining our three most significant results with the observations of @xcite",
    ", we find that 11 grb locations have been observed with scuba to noise levels @xmath10 2mjy , and in all but two ( grb 980329 , @xcite and grb 000210 , this paper ) detection of submm emission from a host galaxy was ruled out .",
    "the two grb hosts detected by scuba @xcite had afterglows with optical transients .",
    "therefore , while some grbs definitely are located in dusty galaxies , the route to selecting these grbs on the basis of their afterglow data is not yet clear .",
    "since grbs can only clear dust out to less than 100 pc distance @xcite , it would be surprising if optically - selected samples of grbs are not generally biased against dusty hosts .    however , as noted above , there may be alternative explanations for the optical faintness of some afterglows beyond location in a dusty host galaxy .",
    "our results indicate that radio - located optically - dark bursts seem not to be reliable indicators of luminous , dusty host galaxies .",
    "it may be that the physical conditions of the ism in the densest star forming regions are incompatible with the generation of intense radio emission from grb shocks . in that regard",
    ", it would ultimately be interesting , and certainly possible in the swift era , to study a sample of hosts of purely x - ray selected grbs , with the hope that the prompter x - ray emission would be less affected by the wider environment of the progenitor .    from the scuba observations alone",
    ", we can not separate the possibility that there is little dust in these systems from the possibility that there is a lot of dust but insufficient uv photons to make it glow brightly .",
    "alternatively , the dust may be heated to high temperatures and so can not be detected by scuba at all",
    ". the predicted flux of a @xmath11 galaxy at @xmath12 decreases from 20mjy to 0.08mjy as the dust temperature increases from 20k to 80k ( see fig.5 in @xcite ) .",
    "typical dust temperatures for submm - selected objects are thought to be 40k @xcite , but a temperature @xmath13k would be hot enough to prevent such a galaxy being detected above the 2mjy confusion limit of scuba .",
    "however , optical colours of the host galaxies of grbs 970828 , 981226 and 000210 @xcite show only modest reddening , to the optical depths that can be probed , and thus perhaps imply little dust overall in the hosts .",
    "ideally , high - resolution observations to locate dust - enshrouded star - formation activity with respect to the location of grbs need to be made .",
    "the results presented here suggest that a more extensive deep submm survey of grb hosts is necessary to investigate their far - infrared and submm properties in detail , and this is now underway at the jcmt ( barnard et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "veb is supported by a pparc studentship .",
