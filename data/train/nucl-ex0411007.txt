    "r10 cm        at transverse momenta above @xmath14  gev / c however , the measured @xmath15 values seem to saturate and therefore are not describe by the hydro - dynamic calculations anymore .",
    "more interesting than this deviation between data and calculation is an apparent splitting between mesons and baryons , independent of their masses . while mass ordering is an essential feature of hydro - dynamics and has been shown to lead to lower @xmath15 values for heavier particles in the low transverse momentum region @xcite , a mass independent splitting between mesons and baryons has also been observed in the nuclear modification factor @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "voloshin first suggested a scaling of @xmath15 and @xmath17 with the number of constituent quarks for all particle species @xcite , which has been interpreted as a signal for a partonic phase in the early stages of the collision .",
    "this interpretation is supported by quark coalescence and quark recombination models , which are able to reproduce the measured @xmath15 and @xmath17 values at intermediate transverse momenta ( @xmath18@xmath19  gev / c ) when assuming a system of thermalized quarks @xcite .",
    "please note , at even higher transverse momenta ( @xmath20  gev / c ) , hadron production is expected to be dominated by parton fragmentation , hence quark coalesence models should break down in the high-@xmath21 region @xcite .    in the regime where quark coalescence is valid ,",
    "the elliptic flow for all particle species can be expressed as @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the number of constituent quarks and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the hadron ( quark ) elliptic flow amplitude .",
    "figure [ fig : scaledv2 ] @xcite shows the scaled flow amplitudes @xmath26 as a function of @xmath27 for three meson and three baryon species , again for the 80% most central events from @xmath12 collisions at @xmath13  gev . ignoring the low momentum pions , which suffer from strong resonance feed - down , the number - of - constituent - quark - scaling seems to nicely hold for hadrons built up from @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks .",
    "note , there is no evident ordering between hadrons of different strangeness content , suggesting that the @xmath10 quark s flow is similar to that of the @xmath9 quarks @xcite .     as a function of @xmath27 for mesons and baryons.,width=377 ]    with the arrival of the first charm measurements from the rhic detectors , it is now of great interest to study the elliptic flow of charmed hadrons . within quark coalescence models , and @xmath15 of @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "quarks being determined from figures [ fig : strangev2 ] and [ fig : scaledv2 ] , elliptic flow measurements from d - mesons present a direct measure of the @xmath28 quark elliptic flow ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks which are predominantly produced in soft collisions , @xmath28 quarks are expected to be produced via hard processes . at the time of their creation",
    ", @xmath28 quarks should therefore be unaware of the collision geometry , i.e. carry no azimuthal anisotropies . due to",
    "the large mass of the @xmath28 quark , dong @xcite argue , that large @xmath29 values can only be achieved if re - scattering in a partonic phase is strong enough to also thermalized the light quarks .",
    "the measurement of d - meson elliptic flow might therefore not only challenge our current understanding of charmed hadron production , but also strengthen the case of a system with partonic degrees of freedom and is a sensitive probe of thermalization therein .",
    "although we have reported on measurements of open charm directly via invariant mass reconstruction of d - mesons from hadronic decays , i.e. @xmath30 , in d+au collisions @xcite , low signal statistic and the large combinatoric background beneath the signal do not allow to study azimuthal anisotropies .",
    "however , at higher transverse momenta semileptonic decays ( @xmath31 ) are expected to dominate the single electron spectrum and for momenta higher than @xmath32  gev / c , the decay electron s azimuthal angle reflects the d - meson s azimuth angle very accurately as shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : greco_v2_charm ] .",

    "for the analysis reported on here , we studied data from au+au collisions at @xmath13  gev recorded by star@xcite during brookhaven s rhic beam - time in the year 2001 . selecting the 80% most central events from a minimum bias triggered data set and after applying quality cuts ( e.g. requiring the primary vertex to be located within @xmath36  cm from the center of the star * t*ime * p*rotection * c*hamber ( tpc ) @xcite along the beam - axis ) , we used about 2 m events .",

    "the shaded areas indicate the @xmath42 region accepted , leading to a non - electron contamination of about 10% , while rejecting about 80% of the total electron yield .",
    "before these electron candidates are correlated with the reaction - plane , we perform an invariant mass calculation for each candidate with all other tracks within the same event .",
    "the so obtained invariant mass distribution ( see figure [ fig : gammamass ] ) features three distinct regions : a ) a sharp peak from @xmath50 conversion in the detector material , b ) a smeared out peak from the @xmath51 dalitz decay where the @xmath52 is not reconstructed , and c ) the combinatoric background of random @xmath53 pairs .",
    "all electrons which form a pair with an invariant mass of less that @xmath54  mev / c@xmath55 are removed from the candidate sample .",
    "r9 cm        with detailed simulations of the star detector and using the @xmath56 distribution from @xcite , we find that this method eliminates about 50% of all electrons originating from @xmath56 decays and @xmath52-conversions . in the momentum interval @xmath57",
    ", we estimate our electron sample to constitute to 63% from d - meson decays and to 37% from electrons from the remaining photonic sources ( @xmath52 conversion and @xmath56 dalitz decays ) .",

    "other sources of systematic uncertainties ( e.g. a slight systematic bias against central events when removing @xmath52conversion electrons ) are still under investigation .",
    "figure [ fig : results ] shows our preliminary single electron elliptic flow results as a function of transverse momentum ( open bullets ) .",
    "again , the vertical bars represent only the statistical uncertainties and our preliminary systematic uncertainty estimate is about @xmath69 .",
