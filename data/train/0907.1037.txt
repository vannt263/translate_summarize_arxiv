    "in carbon - rich evolved objects , there are two prominent , mysterious emission features known as the `` 21@xmath1 '' and `` 30@xmath1 '' features ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "the 21@xmath1 feature is seen almost exclusively in 16 protoplanetary nebulae ( ppne ) and its identification is notoriously difficult ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the 30@xmath1 feature , first discovered by @xcite in the _ kuiper airborne observatory _ spectrometry of c stars and planetary nebulae ( pne ) , is very broad and strong , extending from @xmath024@xmath1 to @xmath045@xmath1 and accounting for up to @xmath030% of the total infrared ( ir ) luminosity of the object @xcite .",
    "feature consists of two subfeatures : a narrow feature at 26@xmath1 and a broad one at 33@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "but this was not confirmed by _",
    "more ubiquitously seen in c - rich objects than the 21@xmath1 feature , the 30@xmath1 feature has been detected in 63 galactic and 25 magellanic objects ( see @xcite and references therein ) , including asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , post - agb stars and pne .",
    "sources all exhibit the 30@xmath1 feature .",
    "but these two features do not appear to correlate in their strengths ( see @xcite ) . unlike the 21@xmath1 feature which displays little shape variation , the 30@xmath1 feature varies in its peak wavelength and width among different sources ( e.g. see ) . ]",
    "compared to the 21@xmath1 feature for which over a dozen carrier candidates have been proposed , the identification of the 30@xmath1 feature has not received the attention it deserves . magnesium sulfide ( mgs ) solids were first proposed by @xcite as a carrier of the 30@xmath1 feature , based on ( 1 ) the similarity of the observed emission spectral profiles and the laboratory spectra of mgs @xcite , and ( 2 ) the considerations of c - rich equilibrium condensation chemistry which predicts the condensation of mgs in c - rich stars @xcite .",
    "the mgs proposition gains further support from detailed modeling of the 30@xmath1 feature of a large number of c - rich sources obtained by the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) .",
    "a valid carrier candidate should not only reproduce the observed emission spectra but also satisfy the abundance constraints ( i.e. , the amounts of elements required to lock up in the carrier should not exceed what are available in the 30@xmath1 sources ) .",
    "the absorption profile @xmath2 of mgs dust with a distribution of ellipsoidal shapes exhibits a broad band around 30@xmath1 . to fit the observed 30@xmath1 emission spectra",
    ", one often compares the observed spectra with @xmath3 , the product of the absorption efficiency and a blackbody with an assumed temperature @xmath4 ( e.g. see ) .",
    "the mgs temperature is an essential parameter : it not only affects the shape and peak wavelength of the model emission spectrum but also determines the total amount of mgs dust @xmath5 required to account for the flux @xmath6 emitted from the 30@xmath1 band : @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "previous models based on mgs do not seem to have a sulfur ( s ) budget problem .",
    "however , the mgs temperatures adopted in these models were often treated as a free parameter and were derived from matching the spectral profiles of the observed 30@xmath1 feature with @xmath8 by varying @xmath4 ( e.g. see ) . due to the lack of the dielectric functions in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , visible and near - ir wavelength ranges for mgs dust , it is not possible to calculate the precise thermal equilibrium temperatures of mgs dust in the 30@xmath1 sources .",
    "therefore , the previously derived s budget may be questionable .    in this work",
    "we make a rather generous estimation of the uv / visible absorptivity of mgs and calculate its temperatures in the circumstellar shell of hd56126 , a prototypical source of the 21@xmath1 and 30@xmath1 features .",
    "it is shown that the required mgs dust mass exceeds what would be available by a substantial amount .",
    "we therefore argue that mgs is unlikely the carrier of the 30@xmath1 feature .",
    "in order to calculate the temperature of a dust species , the knowledge of its optical properties over a wide wavelength range is required .",
    "unfortunately , the dielectric functions of mgs have only been experimentally determined in the ir ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "the uv / visible absorptivities of mgs dust are essential since they determine how much energy will be absorbed by a given mgs grain ( when exposed to starlight ) which in turn determines how much energy will be emitted in the ir .",
    "it is this balance of energy between absorption and emission that determines the grain temperature .",
    "we take the following procedure to approach the uv / visible absorption efficiency @xmath9 of mgs dust : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a constant and the cut - off wavelength @xmath12 depends on grain size ( and material )",
    ". what would be the reasonable @xmath11 and @xmath12 values for mgs ? to shed light on this",
    ", we use mie theory to calculate the uv to near - ir absorption efficiencies for spherical grains of various compositions and sizes .",
    "we consider both dielectric ( amorphous silicate , amorphous carbon , organic refractory ) and metallic materials ( graphite , iron fe , magnetite fe@xmath13o@xmath14 ) .",
    "we then approximate the calculated absorption profiles @xmath2 with eq.[eq : qabs_uv ] . for submicron - sized dust , as shown in figure[fig:1 ] , while @xmath15 is a reasonable estimation for both dielectric and metallic dust , the cut - off wavelength for a given size @xmath16 is generally shorter for dielectric dust ( @xmath17)0.07@xmath1 in size , @xmath12 is much smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "this is due to the sudden rise in absorption caused by the electronic transition at @xmath19@xmath00.10.2@xmath1 @xcite . ]",
    "than that for metallic dust ( @xmath20 ) . for mgs dust of size @xmath16",
    ", we thus adopt @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we note that , as can be seen in figure[fig:1 ] , eq.[eq : qabs_uv ] with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) almost always overestimates the actual uv / visible absorptivities of all six dust species , particularly at @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests that the mgs temperatures derived using the uv / visible absorptivity of eq.[eq : qabs_uv ] would be overestimated and thus one would underestimate @xmath5 ( since it is most likely that eq.[eq : qabs_uv ] also overestimates the actual uv / visible absorptivity of mgs ) .    in the ir",
    ", we will use the dielectric functions of mg@xmath25fe@xmath26s measured by @xcite in the 10200@xmath1 wavelength range to calculate the absorption efficiencies @xmath27 of mgs . at longer wavelengths we will extrapolate assuming @xmath28 .",
    "we will consider both spherical dust and dust with a cde ( continuous distribution of ellipsoids ) shape distribution @xcite .",
    "finally , we smoothly join @xmath29 and @xmath27 through @xmath30 @xmath31 ~.\\ ] ] the absorption efficiency synthesized from eq.[eq : uv+ir ] is dominated by @xmath29 at @xmath32 and by @xmath27 at @xmath33 ( see figure[fig : synthetic qabs ] ) .",
    "a successful candidate carrier should be able to explain the observed 30@xmath1 feature in all sources .",
    "a failure in a single source would be sufficient to rule out the candidate . to examine whether the carriers can account for the observed feature strength , we choose hd56126 , a prototypical source of the 21@xmath1 and 30@xmath1 features and one of",
    "the best studied post - agb stars , as the tester .",
    "performed a homogeneous photospheric abundance analysis for hd56126 , and derived the abundances of sulfur and carbon to be @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "hd56126 has a radius of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the solar radius ) , and a luminosity of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the solar luminosity ) .",
    "we approximate the stellar radiation by the kurucz model atmospheric spectrum with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we adopt a distance of @xmath42 from earth to hd56126 .",
    "the size and mass of the circumstellar envelope of hd56126 , which are important for determining the quantity of mgs dust available in the envelope , are still controversial . suggested that the dust is confined to the envelope with radius between 1.2@xmath432.6@xmath43 based on their mid - ir imaging at 11.9@xmath1 .",
    "their detailed radiative transfer model derived a circumstellar envelope mass of @xmath44@xmath450.160.44@xmath46 , depending on the assumed gas - to - dust ratio ( @xmath0220600 ) .",
    "@xcite found a more extended envelope ( with radius between 1.2@xmath437@xmath43 ) based on their co j=10 line emission images .",
    "they derived a much smaller mass for the envelope ( @xmath470.059@xmath46 ) .",
    "by assuming the envelope is optically thin , feature strength . ]",

    "this is because for @xmath56 where there is significant stellar radiation , @xmath57 , while in the ir the dust is in the rayleigh regime and therefore @xmath58 .",
    "] we see that for @xmath59 @xmath4 decreases from @xmath0110k at the inner most shell to @xmath050k at the outer boundary , significantly lower than that adopted by , @xmath60 .",
    "larger dust has a lower @xmath4 ( e.g. for dust of @xmath61 , @xmath4 is lower than that of @xmath62 by about @xmath010k ) .",

    "we will consider two spatial distribution functions : ( 1 ) @xmath68 , which means the mass loss of the central star is constant during the whole process;. ] and ( 2 ) @xmath69 , which was shown by to closely fit the observed sed and mid - ir images ( with the dust confined to a narrow zone of 1.2@xmath432.6@xmath43 from the star ) .",
    "the power output per unit mass in the 30@xmath1 band is calculated by integrating @xmath70 over the entire band ( with the continuum subtracted ) @xmath71 the mgs mass @xmath72 required to account for the observed 30@xmath1 emission in hd56126 is @xmath73 where @xmath742@xmath7510@xmath76ergs@xmath77 is the total power emitted from the 30@xmath1 feature of hd56126 .",
    "we calculate @xmath72 and tabulate the results in table[tab : mgsmass_1 ] .",

    "the required mgs mass is also affected by the adopted dust spatial density distribution : the @xmath80 distribution requires more mgs ( since it places more mgs grains in the cool , outer envelope region ) .",

    "exceeding what would be available in hd56126 roughly by one order of magnitude ( see  [ sec : ava ] ) .",
    "the 30@xmath1 feature arising from spherical mgs dust is too sharp to be comparable with the 30@xmath1 feature seen in c - rich objects .",
    "this is why a cde shape distribution is often invoked ( e.g. see ) .",
    "unfortunately , the simple formula of @xcite for calculating the absorption cross sections of cde dust is only valid in the rayleigh regime ( i.e. @xmath83 ) .",
    "there is no precise way to derive the uv / visual absorption efficiencies of cde dust ( which are crucial to determine its heating rate and equilibrium temperature ) .",
    "we therefore simply adopt the equilibrium temperatures calculated for its spherical counterpart .",
    "the mgs mass required to account for the observed 30@xmath1 emission power is derived from eqs.[eq : fmgs ] , [ eq : etot ] and [ eq : mmgs ] with @xmath84 calculated from the cde shape distribution ( @xcite ) . as shown in table[tab : mgsmass_1 ] , the cde model requires @xmath030% less mgs mass than the spherical model , but still needs much more than what could be available in hd56126 .",

    "even with @xmath90=600 , @xmath72 appreciably exceeds what is available in hd56126 !",

    "the mgs budget problem would be more severe for objects with a stronger 30@xmath1 band and cooler mgs dust ( e.g. iras19454 , a post - agb star , requires @xmath123 ; see ) .",
    "recently performed a detailed study of the condensation of mgs in the outflows from c - rich stars on the tip of the agb .",
