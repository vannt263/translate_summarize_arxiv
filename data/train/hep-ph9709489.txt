    "exclusive reactions at large momentum transfer @xmath2 can be calculated in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) owing to a factorization theorem @xcite that separates the short - distance physics of the partonic subreactions at the scale @xmath2 from the longer - distance physics associated with the binding of the partons inside the hadrons .",
    "the full amplitude is given as a sum of terms , where each term factors into two parts , a hard - scattering amplitude @xmath3 , calculable in pqcd , and wave functions @xmath4 for each hadron @xmath5 : @xmath6 the separate dependence on the factorization scale @xmath7 cancels , to the order considered , in the full amplitude @xmath8 .",
    "the importance of the various terms in ( [ hsafact ] ) depends on their scaling with @xmath9 . for the contribution that has the weakest fall - off with @xmath2 ( leading - twist contribution ) , the amplitude @xmath3 describes the scattering of clusters of _ collinear _ partons from the hadron and is given by _ valence - parton _ scatterings only .",
    "hence the only non - perturbative input required are the distribution amplitudes ( das ) @xmath10 for finding valence quarks in the hadron , each carrying some fraction @xmath11 of the hadron s momentum .",
    "the das represent wave functions integrated over transverse momentum @xmath12 up to a factorization scale @xmath7 , of order @xmath2 , and obey the bl evolution equations @xcite .",
    "indeed , most calculations so far have been performed in this standard hard - scattering approach ( shsa ) summarized by : + @xmath13 leading ( i.e.  valence ) fock states only ; + @xmath13 collinear approximation ; + @xmath13 ( mostly ) lowest - order in @xmath14 ; + @xmath13 tailored for @xmath15-wave hadrons ( orbital angular momentum @xmath16 ) . up to now results of the shsa remained at a qualitative level , lacking a rigorous discussion of ( in particular the power - like @xmath17 ) corrections .",
    "power corrections can be classified as follows : ( i ) corrections arising from the overlap of the soft wave functions ; ( ii ) corrections associated with the transverse momentum of the partons inside the hadrons ; ( iii ) corrections from higher fock states .",
    "recently , exclusive processes at large scales have attracted new interest : + @xmath13 new , precise data on the pion ",
    "photon transition form factor allow a quantitative extraction of the ( non - perturbative ) pion da @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath13 a modified hard - scattering approach ( mhsa ) has been developed , which allows for the incorporation of transverse degrees of freedom and gluonic radiative corrections in the form of a sudakov factor @xcite .",
    "this does not only allow for a dynamical setting of the renormalization , @xmath18 , and factorization , da@xmath19 , scales .",
    "now also the perturbative contribution to exclusive observables can be calculated self - consistently , i.e.  without major contributions from phase - space regions , where the virtualities of the internal partons become soft and perturbation theory is not applicable .",

    "the non - relativistic quark - potential model is very successful in describing the static properties of heavy quarkonia .",
    "a quarkonium @xmath62 is considered to be pure , obviously colour - singlet , @xmath63 state where the @xmath64-pair is bound by an instantaneous potential .",
    "the non - relativistic nature of the bound system implies the existence of three important scales ( besides the heavy - quark mass @xmath65 ) : ( the modulus of ) the heavy - quark three momentum @xmath66 , the quark s kinetic energy @xmath67 , and the qcd scale @xmath45 .",
    "inclusive quarkonium decays into light hadrons are accessible to perturbative qcd : for sufficiently large @xmath65 , the annihilation time @xmath68 is much smaller than the time scales relevant to @xmath64 binding .",
    "hence the short - distance annihilation of the @xmath64 pair into gluons and light quarks can be separated from the long - distance effects of @xmath64 binding .",
    "the basis of this separation is provided by an effective field theory , nrqcd , supplemented by perturbative factorization @xcite .",
    "the inclusive decay rate is given as a double expansion in @xmath69 and @xmath70 , to leading order in @xmath71 .",
    "the factorization makes use of the fact that there are , in any feynman diagram , some propagators that are off shell by an amount @xmath72 much larger than the scales governing @xmath64 binding .",
    "hence , in the effective low - energy theory these may be contracted to a point .",
    "the remainder of the diagram involves only distances much larger than @xmath73 . for the case of inclusive decays , these are related to expectation values of universal long - distance matrix elements ( mes ) @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath74 are well - defined 4-fermion operators of nrqcd of the form @xmath75 .",
    "the inclusive decay widths thus take on the form @xmath76 where the short - distance coefficients @xmath77 are calculable as perturbation series in @xmath69 .",
    "the importance of the various long - distance mes in ( [ gamincl ] ) is given by their scaling with the heavy - quark velocity @xmath78 .",
    "the velocity - scaling ( power - counting ) rules were first established based on consistency requirements of the nrqcd field equations @xcite .",
    "more rigorously , these follow from a multipole expansion in the wavelength of the emitted ( multiple ) gluon field @xmath79 . in nrqcd , @xmath80 .",
    "this formulation has the advantage that it can be generalized to the situation where @xmath45 is not much smaller than @xmath81 ( as assumed in nrqcd ) giving rise to different scaling rules @xcite .",
    "the @xmath82 is dominantly an @xmath15-wave state .",
    "its fock - state expansion starts as @xmath83 where the subscripts @xmath84 and @xmath85 denote colour - singlet and colour - octet states , respectively .",
    "annihilation into light hadrons via the valence fock state involves the me @xmath86 , which we take to scale as @xmath87 ( dividing out an overall @xmath88 scaling ) . in the potential model this corresponds to @xmath89 .",
    "the first corrections for @xmath15-wave quarkonia arise from higher - dimensional operators ( suppressed by @xmath70 ) still involving the leading fock component .",
    "these lead , for example , to differences between the @xmath82 and @xmath90 wave functions .",
    "the colour - octet component of ( [ sfockexp ] ) enters first at relative order @xmath91 .",
    "nonetheless , its contribution can be important , namely when the short - distance coefficients of the singlet states are suppressed by powers of @xmath69 and/or kinematical factors .",
    "an example is @xmath82 production at high transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "the situation is different for @xmath21 , as becomes evident from their fock - state expansion @xmath92 the @xmath70 factor of the @xmath93 multipole suppression of the @xmath94 state is compensated by the fact that a @xmath95-wave operator scales as @xmath70 relative to an @xmath15-wave operator .",
    "hence , contrary to the case of @xmath15-wave decays , _ two _ @xmath46-fermion operators contribute to the decay rate of @xmath95-wave states into light hadrons at leading order in @xmath78 @xmath96 & = &     \\frac{c_1}{{m_{{{{\\mathrm{c}}}}}}^4}\\ ,        \\langle \\chi_{{{{\\mathrm{c}}}}j } | { \\cal o}_1(^3p_j ) | \\chi_{{{{\\mathrm{c}}}}j } \\rangle   \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\hspace*{-50pt } + ~ \\frac{c_8}{{m_{{{{\\mathrm{c}}}}}}^2}\\ ,        \\langle \\chi_{{{{\\mathrm{c}}}}j } | { \\cal o}_8(^3s_1 ) | \\chi_{{{{\\mathrm{c}}}}j } \\rangle     + o(v^2 \\gamma ) \\ .",

    "the decays of @xmath95-wave ( and higher orbital - angular - momentum states ) probe components of the quarkonium wave function that involve dynamical gluons",
    ". however , the contribution to the inclusive annihilation rate from the higher fock state @xmath98 is parametrized through a single number , namely the expectation value of the octet operator between the @xmath21 state , i.e.   the colour - octet matrix element in ( [ eq : inclfact ] ) .",
    "[ fig : exclfact ]    in contrast to inclusive decays , there are now two possibilities to absorb long - distance contributions , into either quarkonium - specific or light - hadron - specific objects . in order to set up a factorization scheme for exclusive",
    "quarkonium decays one has to consider the virtualities occurring in an arbitrary feynman diagram .",
    "three regions have to be distinguished .",
    "propagators can be off shell by order @xmath99 , @xmath100 , or @xmath101 .",
    "correspondingly , such contributions have to be associated with the hard amplitude , the quarkonium , or the light hadrons , respectively .",
    "this then leads to a triple expansion in @xmath69 , @xmath78 , and  @xmath102 .",
    "another difference with inclusive hadronic decays is the fact that the factorization into short - distance and long - distance contributions holds at the amplitude level rather than at the level of decay rates ( i.e.  squared amplitudes ) . in this sense factorization of exclusive",
    "decays resembles more the case of inclusive electromagnetic decays , where the final - state particles are also colour singlets .",
    "higher fock components in light hadrons certainly exist .",
    "consider the decay @xmath20 , fig .",
    "[ fig : col8graphs ] .",
    "the ( multipole - based ) fock - state expansion of the pion starts as follows @xmath103 since both octet terms give corrections to the leading one of the same order @xmath104 , two new ( non - perturbative ) light - cone das had to be specified in a calculation using higher fock components of the pion .",
    "clearly , not much predictive power can be expected .",
    "in fact , higher fock contributions to the pion mesons . ]",
    "are power - suppressed ( @xmath105 ) and hence become negligible for sufficiently large quark masses .",
    "in contrast , higher fock components of heavy quarkonia are suppressed by powers of @xmath78 only , or even scale as the leading fock contribution . moreover , owing to the non - relativistic expansion one does not need new das but only new ` decay constants ' ( expectation values of nrqcd operators ) . of course , there remains the problem of colour conservation .",
    "a perturbative factorization can be set up for the case @xmath106 for @xmath107 since this allows one to treat the constituent gluon(s ) as the constituent ( valence ) quarks .",
    "colour conservation is then achieved by coupling the constituent gluon ( in all possible ways ) to the hard process , see fig .",
    "[ fig : col8graphs ] .",
    "the calculation of @xmath20 in the collinear approximation leads , however , to singular results .",
    "this is not surprising as the feynman diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : col8graphs ] must contain contributions , which , to leading order in @xmath108 , constitute the two higher fock states @xmath109 of the pion .",
    "the regularization of the propagators associated with the ` would - be ' constituent gluon of the pion depends on the hierarchy of @xmath102 and @xmath70 : the singularities are protected by either relativistic correction @xmath110 to the heavy - quark momentum or the finite transverse momentum @xmath111 of the ( light ) valence quarks of the pion .",
    ".results for the @xmath21 decay widths ( in kev ) into pions ( @xmath112 ; @xmath113 ) in comparison with experimental data . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it is now possible to obtain accurate predictions for exclusive reactions involving pseudoscalar mesons . on the one hand",
    ", the non - perturbative input , their das , can well be determined from recent precise measurements of the meson ",
    "photon transition form factors . on the other hand , with mhsa an improved framework exists for calculations of the contributions of the leading fock state . hence , the leading colour - singlet contributions are well under control .    in the case of",
    "the charmonium @xmath21 decays into a pair of pseudoscalars , one finds that the colour - singlet contribution alone is not sufficient to accommodate the data .",
    "indeed , it turns out that the colour - octet contribution from the @xmath98 fock state contributes at the same level as the colour - singlet one .",
    "its inclusion yields good agreement with experimental data .    in general",
    ", one can expect colour - octet contributions to be important if the contribution from the leading fock state is suppressed .",
    "this happens for quarkonia with orbital - angular momentum @xmath114 .",
    "it occurs also if decays of the leading fock state into massless quarks ( @xmath115 ) are forbidden by a symmetry ( such as @xmath116-parity or helicity ) so that these seemingly leading decays are actually power - suppressed @xmath117 .",
    "the study @xcite is a first attempt to derive a factorization approach for exclusive decays of heavy quarkonia . more work is needed to generalize the factorization to higher orders in @xmath118 , @xmath78 , and @xmath71 .",
    "in particular it has to be shown that the various contributions in an arbitrary feynman diagram can be disentangled in a systematic way .",
