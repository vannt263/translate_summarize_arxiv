    "inelastic x - ray scattering is called compton scattering when the energy and the momentum transferred are large compared to the characteristic energy and reciprocal interelectronic distance of the scattering system .",
    "compton scattering probes the electronic structure of materials through the electronic momentum distribution and , if the scattering system is metallic , gives direct information on various characteristics of the fermi surface , such as position and size of the fermi breaks and their renormalization due to electron - electron correlation .",
    "fermi momenta are of the order of 1 a.u . so that high - resolution in momentum are necessary in order to resolve features related to the fermi surface .",
    "in the last few years , the advent of high intensity , high energy and well - polarized synchrotron sources has made possible to obtain resolutions of the order of 0.1 a.u .",

    "the range of energy and momentum transferred where the recoil electron can be considered free , _ i.e. _ within the impulse approximation  @xcite , the experimental double - differential compton cross section is related to the momentum distribution @xmath0 of the electronic system as ( in atomic units @xmath1 ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the energy and momentum transferred , @xmath5 is the energy of the scattered photon and @xmath6 is the thomson differential cross section .",
    "the outcome of a compton scattering experiment is therefore given by what is called a compton profile in a given direction @xmath4 and defined as @xmath7 the compton profile at @xmath8 is the integral of the momentum distribution on a plane perpendicular to the unit vector @xmath9 at a distance @xmath8 from the origin .",
    "the momentum distribution is expressed in terms of the wave function of the electronic system as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of electrons and @xmath12 the volume of the system .",
    "since compton experiments can only access the momentum distribution in an indirect way and there are difficulties in handling background or subtracting the core contribution ( the impulse approximation may not hold for the core electrons  @xcite ) , it is important to establish the performance of the technique for a system where high resolution experimental data are available and correlated calculations can be performed .",

    "the jastrow component is periodic over the cell and does not affect the phase of the wave function .",
    "the determinant satisfies the above equation if the single - particle orbitals , @xmath32 , obey similar equations , @xmath33 , that is if the orbitals correspond to a single @xmath29-point sampling of the simulation cell given by @xmath34 .",

    "the allowed momenta coincide with the wave vectors compatible with the condition of periodicity on the simulation cell , so we can obtain a higher resolution in momentum space by performing calculations with different boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "we only consider @xmath29-samplings that yield a grid of @xmath29-points with inversion symmetry so that we can construct a real wave function by occupying linear combinations of pairs of orbitals : @xmath39 by restricting ourselves to real wave functions , we can perform both vmc and dmc calculations and avoid the complications of dealing with complex wave functions in dmc  @xcite . for a cubic simulation cell ,",
    "there are only four vectors @xmath34 that preserve inversion symmetry corresponding to @xmath38 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 sampling of the cubic simulation cell .",
    "the @xmath38-point calculation yields a cubic grid of @xmath29-vectors centered on the origin with spacing @xmath36 and the additional calculations provide three grids shifted by @xmath43 in the [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] directions respectively .    to construct the determinantal part of the wave function , we compute the orbitals on the grid of @xmath29-vectors compatible with the boundary conditions and occupy the orbitals , @xmath44 or @xmath45 , within the first brillouin zone with the lowest free - electron ( @xmath44 ) or lda ( @xmath45 ) energy .",
    "in general , the highest occupied level is degenerate and only partially occupied , so we should employ a linear combination of determinants in order to construct a wave function with the proper symmetry .",
    "we instead always use a single determinant and symmetrize the momentum distribution on the grid of allowed wave vectors by averaging it over symmetry related @xmath29-vectors on the grid .",
    "this procedure is done separately for the four @xmath29-point samplings . finally , by combining the results of the four calculations and applying the symmetry rotations of the cubic group , we obtain a momentum distribution defined on a mesh with spacing @xmath43 .",

    "we only carry out a @xmath38-point calculation .",
    "the wave function is constructed from the orbitals corresponding to the lowest four complete shells of @xmath29-vectors , so it is real , has the full symmetry of the lattice and is a spin - singlet .",

    "the momentum distribution of the correlated wave function is computed as the expectation value over the distribution given either by @xmath48 ( vmc ) or by the product of the trial wave function and the fixed - node solution ( dmc ) : @xmath49 at a given monte carlo step , we uniformly sample @xmath41 random positions , @xmath50 , within the simulation cell and , for each position and particle , compute in turn the above ratio  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath41 depends on the size of the system and is determined to optimize the efficiency in sampling the momentum distribution .",
    "the allowed values of momentum coincide with the sets of vectors compatible with the condition of periodicity imposed on the simulation cell ( eq .  [ bc ] ) .    to obtain the compton profiles",
    ", we have to integrate the momentum distribution over planes perpendicular to a given direction .",
    "it is possible to directly compute the compton profiles within qmc .",
    "for instance , to evaluate the profile in the [ 100 ] direction , we could estimate the following expectation value : @xmath51 this procedure is equivalent to evaluating the integral of the momentum distribution as the histogram over the momenta compatible with the boundary conditions : @xmath52 and it is clearly a poor representation of the integral of a function with several discontinuities , especially if the grid of @xmath29-vectors is coarse .",
    "the compton profiles computed in this way show indeed a strong dependence on the size of the simulation cell .    to obtain compton profiles with",
    "reduced finite size errors , we want to integrate a smoother function than the qmc momentum distribution , @xmath53 .",
    "we have to select a reference distribution , @xmath54 , whose compton profiles , @xmath55 , can be computed with high accuracy and such that the difference , @xmath56 , is a smoother function than the original @xmath53 .",
    "the compton profiles are then obtained as @xmath57 where the corrections , @xmath58 , is computed by integrating @xmath59 on the grid defined by the four @xmath29-point samplings using the linear tetrahedron method .",
    "the only difference in computing @xmath58 from the method described in appendix  [ a1 ] is that there is no kohn - sham energy defined on the grid and no fermi energy but all grid points are considered for integration . in section  [ s4 ] , we will show our choice for the reference momentum distribution .",
    "we present calculations of the momentum distribution and compton profiles within lda kohn - sham density functional theory .",
    "we perform both pseudopotential and full - core calculations .",
    "we then compute the momentum distribution within pseudopotential qmc and determine the correlation contribution to the directional compton profiles .      in fig .",
    "[ lda ] , we show the lda momentum distribution along the [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] directions for a local ( @xmath37-component ) and a non - local ( @xmath37- and @xmath60-components ) pseudopotential . the effect of the lattice on the momentum distribution is more pronounced when using a non - local pseudopotential , yielding a bigger reduction below the fermi break and a more significant contribution from the secondary fermi surfaces ( unklapp processes ) . for both the local and non - local pseudopotentials ,",
    "the momentum distribution is strongly anisotropic and goes to zero after the first fermi break since the fermi surface of lithium is completely contained within the first brillouin zone .",
    "= 9 cm    we find that the momentum distribution obtained with the non - local pseudopotential is in better qualitative agreement with our full - core calculations .",
    "therefore , for a more realistic description of bcc lithium , we have to use a non - local pseudopotential even though this is computationally more demanding in qmc and introduces the additional locality approximation in dmc  @xcite .",
    "the agreement of the valence momentum distributions from a non - local pseudopotential and a full - core calculation is only qualitative because of the pseudopotential approximation ( lack of correct orthogonalization between core and valence ) . when computing the momentum distribution within a pseudopotential scheme , we are underestimating the momentum distribution at high momenta and , consequently , overestimating it at low momenta .",
    "this effect is also evident in the compton profiles .    in fig  [ fc_pp ] ,",
    "the pseudopotential compton profiles are compared with the valence profiles obtained with the full - core potential in the [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] directions .",
    "we normalize the compton profiles to the number of valence electrons per unit cell , in this case one electron .",
    "as expected , the compton profiles constructed from valence orbitals correctly orthogonalized to the core orbitals show a higher tail at high momenta than the pseudopotential profiles and , since they must integrate to the same value , a significantly lower value at low momenta .",
    "the compton profile of a free particle system at the same density of lithium ( @xmath61 a.u . ) is an up - side - down parabola terminating at @xmath62 a.u . due to electron - ion correlation ,",
    "the kohn - sham profiles develop a tail beyond @xmath63 but the sharp features of the presence of a fermi surface is clearly visible in any direction at about @xmath64 a.u .",
    "its location varies however for the different directions as a result of the already observed anisotropy ( see fig .",
    "[ lda ] ) .",

    "the effect is more pronounced in the [ 110 ] direction at about @xmath65 a.u . and",
    "all profiles show an additional bump in the far tail ( above 1.6 a.u . ) .",
    "= 9 cm    within pseudopotential quantum monte carlo , we will compute a correction to the compton profiles due to electronic correlations .",
    "this correction will be summed to the valence compton profile from a full - core calculation to account properly for core - valence orthogonality .      in order to calculate the correlation corrections to the kohn - sham compton profiles of fig .",
    "[ fc_pp ] , we first determine potential and wave function needed to correctly describe the momentum distribution of solid lithium within qmc .",
    "we start modeling bcc lithium with the simplest potential and wave function and improve upon it with a more sophisticated wave function and hamiltonian .",
    "the tests are conducted on a small simulation cell of 54 electrons and 54 lithium ions on a bcc lattice and with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we carry out qmc calculations using the troullier - martins pseudopotential and test the use of a local ( @xmath37-component ) and a non - local ( @xmath37- and @xmath60-components ) pseudopotential as we have done within lda density functional theory . for either potential ,",

    "the vmc and dmc spherical momentum distribution for bcc lithium are compared with the vmc momentum distribution of the homogeneous electron gas at the same density ( @xmath61 a.u . ) .",
    "the wave function for the electron gas is given by the product of a determinant of simple plane waves , @xmath44 , and a jastrow factor only containing the electron - electron term described in section  [ s3 ] .",

    ", we have a further reduction of the size of the fermi break due to electron - ion correlation . in all cases ,",
    "the vmc and dmc momentum distribution are almost indistinguishable indicating that for this system the variational wave function is quite close to the fixed - node solution in describing this property .    for both local and non - local pseudopotentials , we test the use of free - electron orbitals , @xmath44 , versus lda orbitals .",
    "the use of orbitals given by a single plane - wave is justified if the dependence of the periodic component of the bloch states is not strongly varying with @xmath68 .",
    "this dependence can then be simply included in the jastrow part as an electron - ion term , @xmath21 ( eq .  [ wf0 ] ) . as shown in fig .",

    "et al . _ and the qmc profiles ,",
    "the lam - platzman correction offer a satisfactory description of electronic correlation in qmc even though they are isotropic and can not resolve the directional differences observed within qmc .    in disagreement with the gw calculations  @xcite ,",
    "the qmc results indicate that electronic correlation in lithium only accounts for about 30% of the discrepancy between experimental data and conventional band theoretical results .",
    "a similar conclusion has been recently obtained in a comparison of qmc and experimental compton profiles for bulk silicon  @xcite .",
    "other effects such as temperature  @xcite or the interpretation of experimental results ( in particular , the validity of the impulse approximation  @xcite ) may explain the difference between experiments and qmc calculations .",
    "our calculations also show that qmc can not only offer a qualitative description of correlation effects in compton profiles but , if finite size errors are properly taken care of , also resolve directional differences in the correlation corrections to the lda results and provide useful comparisons for new compton scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "this work is supported by nsf ( grant dmr 9422496 ) .",
    "we are grateful to dr .",
    "y.  sakurai for sending us the experimental results and to prof .",
    "jose luis martins for giving us his plane - wave code .",
    "we thank bernardo barbiellini and p. platzman for suggesting this project and for many useful discussions . c.  f.  also benefited from several discussions with erik koch , keijo hmlinen , aleksi soininen and laurent bellaiche .",
    "the calculations were performed at the national center for supercomputing applications of the university of illinois at urbana - champaign .",
    "to determine the momentum distribution within kohn - sham density functional theory , the kohn - sham valence wave functions and eigenvalues are evaluated on a very fine grid of @xmath29-points within the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone .",
    "the fourier coefficients of the orbitals with the corresponding eigenvalues are unfolded from the irreducible zone to full space and the momentum distribution is obtained by simply squaring the fourier components .",
    "this procedure yields a square mesh with the momentum distribution and single - particle energy defined at each point .    to obtain the compton profiles in a given direction",
    ", we integrate the momentum distribution using the linear tetrahedron method as described by lehmann and taut  @xcite .",
    "the expression for the compton profile ( eq .",
    "[ cp ] ) is rewritten as @xmath90 where @xmath0 and @xmath91 are the kohn - sham single - particle momentum distribution and energy and @xmath92 the fermi energy .",
    "the @xmath93-function is introduced to ensure that only states below the fermi energy are included .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath91 have been computed on a square grid in momentum space , the mesh naturally divides space in cubes whose corners are defined by the grid points .",
    "each cube is then divided in six tetrahedra and each tetrahedron is considered in turn . within each tetrahedron , @xmath0 and @xmath91",
    "are linearly interpolated .",
    "the step function @xmath94 may restrict the integration to only part of the tetrahedron : the primary tetrahedron is divided in secondary ones delimited by the boundaries @xmath95 . for a given value of @xmath8 , the surface of constant projection , @xmath96 ,",
    "is determined within each of the secondary tetrahedra and the contribution to @xmath97 is computed as the integral over this surface of the linear interpolation of the momentum distribution .    before computing the compton profiles ,",
    "the fermi energy @xmath92 must be estimated .",
    "for a given value of the fermi energy , we apply the linear tetrahedron construction to determine the volume delimited by the fermi surface and iteratively change @xmath92 so that @xmath98 where @xmath63 is the fermi momentum .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ s4 ] , due to the lack of correct orthogonalization between core and valence , the pseudopotential momentum distribution is too low at high momenta and , consequently , too high at low momenta . to account for the correct oscillatory behavior of the valence wave functions ,",
    "the valence orbitals are usually computed within traditional all - electron schemes ( lapw or lmto ) or , alternatively , the true valence wave functions are reconstructed from the pseudized orbitals  @xcite . on the other hand , several calculations in the literature",
    "have shown the feasibility of plane - wave calculations using the unscreened coulomb potential for first - row elements  @xcite .",
    "we therefore decided to follow this more straightforward route and adopt a plane - wave basis also with the @xmath99 potential of lithium .    in table",
    "[ t1 ] , we show the convergence in the total energy and the @xmath100 and @xmath101 eigenvalues at the @xmath38 point for full - core solid lithium as a function of plane - wave cutoff . for zone sampling to selfconsistency",
    ", we used 14 special @xmath29-points . to obtain an accuracy of a few mry on either the total energy or the 1_s _ eigenvalue , plane - wave cutoffs higher than 1800 ry",
    "are required . on the other hand ,",
    "the convergence in valence properties such as the 2_s _ level is achieved at significantly lower cutoffs .",
    "bellaiche and kunc  @xcite obtained convergence in the structural properties of solid lih with a plane - wave cutoff of the order of 200 ry and the valence compton profiles were in good agreement with the ones reconstructed by simply orthogonalizing the valence wave functions to a core atomic orbital .",
    "similarly , we find that the valence orbitals of lithium are well converged at about 300 ry and increasing the plane - wave cutoff to 400 ry has a negligible effect on the valence compton profiles .",
    ".total energy of full - core bcc lithium versus the energy cutoff employed in the plane - wave calculation .",
    "the energy of full - core atomic lithium is @xmath102 ry . all energies are in rydberg . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the variance minimization method  @xcite consists of the minimization of the variance of the local energy over a set of @xmath103 configurations @xmath104 sampled from the square of the best wave function available before we start the optimization , @xmath105 : @xmath106=\\sum_i^{n_c}\\left [ \\frac{{\\cal h}\\psi(r_i)}{\\psi(r_i)}-{\\rm e}_{\\rm guess}\\right]^2 w(r_i)/ \\sum_i^{n_c } w(r_i).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] e@xmath107 is a guess for the energy of the state we are interested in and @xmath108 .",
    "we do not allow the ratio of the weights to the average weight to exceed a maximum value .",
    "we compute the expectation value of various operators both in variational and diffusion monte carlo . in vmc ,",
    "configurations are sampled from @xmath48 using metropolis monte carlo method and the expectation value of a given operator @xmath109 is obtained from @xmath110 the transition matrix consists of a drift - diffusion step with a time - step optimized to minimize the auto - correlation time . in dmc , the imaginary - time evolution operator @xmath111 is used to project out the ground state from the trial wave function within the fixed - node and the short - time approximations  @xcite .",
    "the time - step error coming from the short - time approximation is negligible but the fixed - node error limits the accuracy of the results we obtain .",
