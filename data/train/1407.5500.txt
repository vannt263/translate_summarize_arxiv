    "<S> this splitting acts as an effective in - plane magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , relaxation of the spin polarization is accompanied by its rotation around this effective field with an angular frequency @xmath35 , provided that the precession is fast enough with respect to the exciton spin relaxation @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , kerr rotation at zero and small bias is well described by the damped cosine function ( solid line ) , assuming the gaussian distribution of precession frequencies centered at @xmath37  ghz ( corresponding to @xmath38  @xmath16ev ) , with the standard deviation @xmath39  ghz , and the exciton spin relaxation time @xmath40  ps . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is longer than dx spin relaxation expected in a single qw of the same width @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dx coupling to the energetically close ix state is probably responsible for this effect . </S>",
    "<S> coherent rotation of the exciton , rather than an electron spin in the presence of the applied in - plane magnetic field have been observed in time - resolved pl experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown to be governed by the stability of the hole spin within the exciton . </S>",
    "<S> the hole spin relaxation time @xmath41 should satisfy the condition @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the electron - hole exchange energy @xcite . assuming @xmath44  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16ev in the unbiased structure @xcite yields @xmath45 ps , which should be fulfilled in the studied structure under a low power excitation fokina2010 . </S>",
    "<S> application of the electrical bias reduces the exchange energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , at @xmath46  v the kerr rotation decay becomes monotonous . at high voltages , the shortest decay time of order of @xmath47  ps can be attributed to the polarization relaxation of dxs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two other components have characteristic decay times of the order of @xmath10  ps and several nanoseconds , respectively , the latter increasing with the gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> they can be attributed to the spin relaxation of the 2deg , which forms in biased cqws @xcite , and ixs .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the main results of this work is the distinction between the spin polarized ixs and the spin polarized 2deg traditionally studied by pump - probe kerr rotation technique . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage dependence of the spin dynamics suggests , that fastest and slowest components are due to dx and ix , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we reproduce the voltage dependence of these two components within the model of the two coupled oscillators ( solid lines in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figk ]  ( b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the electron spin relaxation is not expected to be voltage dependent , the rashba contribution to the spin - orbit field being small with respect to the dresselhaus field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> within ixs we deal with the spin relaxation of an electron bound to the hole , but their exchange coupling is negligible at high @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the key parameter which controls the spin relaxation of electrons is the degree of their localization in the disorder potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the electron spin relaxation time due to spin - orbit coupling can be written as @xmath49 @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath50 is the characteristic time during which an electron remains localized and is not affected by the spin - orbit field , @xmath51 is the correlation time of the spin - orbit field , and @xmath52 is the spin - orbit frequency . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the relative values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , elections ( ixs ) are either localized @xmath55 , or mobile @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> one can easily see that faster spin relaxation is expected for mobile , than for localized electrons @xcite . because an exciton is heavier than an electron , at low density it can be efficiently localized by the disorder potential , while at high density the mobility threshold can be reached @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to check this idea , we studied the power dependence of the kerr rotation . increasing the pump power allows to increase the ix density up to the mobility threshold , while keeping the electron density fixed . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the slow component disappears above a critical power @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this corroborates the interpretation of the slow component in terms of the spin polarization of the localized ix , which disappears above the mobility threshold . on the other hand , increasing excitation power results to a relatively weak gradual variation of the fast component that supports its assignment to the residual electron spin . </S>",
    "<S> electron spin relaxation is accelerated due to the heating of the electron gas by the photogenerated carriers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ultimate test of this interpretation is the application of a longitudinal magnetic field , which suppresses spin relaxation of residual electrons much more efficiently , than that of the electrons bound to holes within ixs @xcite . for electrons within ix </S>",
    "<S> the suppression factor is given by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the larmor frequency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the electrons which are not bound into the excitons and thus are subject to the cyclotron motion , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the cyclotron frequency . </S>",
    "<S> because the cyclotron frequency is usually higher than the larmor frequency , spin relaxation of the free electrons is expected to be much strongly affected by the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the same @xmath53 is involved in the spin relaxation and it s quenching in the presence of the magnetic field , measuring both times further tightens the conditions on the localization degree of both excitons and electrons . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figk ]  ( c ) shows kerr rotation at @xmath29  v as a function of the pump - probe delay at @xmath61 and @xmath62  t. among the three decay components , only one with @xmath63  ps is affected by the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic study of the magnetic field effect shows that it increases by a factor of three for all @xmath64  v , as expected for the electrons , while slow component remains unchanged , as expected for ixs . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of these results in the framework of the spin orbit relaxation model is reported in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> it allows for the identification of the fast decay as being due to the spin relaxation of resident electrons , and the slow decay as being due to the localized ixs . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath65 reaches about @xmath5  ns ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figk ] ( c ) ) , consistent with the polarization lifetime of localized ixs measured in pl imaging experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> spectral analysis of the @xmath19 and @xmath31 provide important information on the excitonic nonlinearities . </S>",
    "<S> we focus here on the behavior at high voltages and long pump - probe delays , where the signal is dominated by ixs . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spectra ] shows the spectra measured at @xmath29  v and @xmath66  ns . to identify the dominant nonlinearity we follow the roadmap proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first of all we measure linear reflectivity in the vicinity of the dx resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of ixs can modify the linear reflectivity via one of the three mechanisms : energy shift @xmath67 , saturation @xmath68 and narrowing / broadening of the resonance @xmath69 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin independent mechanisms contribute to the photoinduced reflectivity only , while spin - dependent ones are responsible for the kerr rotation . </S>",
    "<S> fitting to the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ spectra ]  ( a ) shows that the photoinduced reflectivity signal is dominated by the dx resonance narrowing . this can be understood as a reduction of the dx inhomogeneous broadening due to the screening of the qw disorder potential by localized ixs . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at least at low ix densities , the impact of the dx blue shift due to the ix - dx interaction on the pump - probe spectra is weaker than that of the narrowing of the dx line . </S>",
    "<S> however , the blue shift of the dx resonance provides the main contribution to the kerr rotation , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ spectra ]  ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with a strong spin dependence of the dx blue shift @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that despite their vanishing oscillator strength , ixs in biased cqws can be efficiently addressed by pump - probe spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of both photoinduced reflectivity and kerr rotation provides a powerful tool for unraveling the spin dynamics of ixs and the 2deg , exploring ix - dx interaction and probing both bright and dark ix populations . in the appropriately chosen cqw devices </S>",
    "<S> , this method may help solving the challenging problems of the exciton physics , which are not easily accessible by other experimental means , such as determination of relative density and spin polarization of the bright and dark ix states .    </S>",
