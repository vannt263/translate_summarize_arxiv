    "remarkable progress has been made in recent years in understanding and improving electronic transport in organic semiconductors ( osc ) and devices .",
    "mobilities exceeding @xmath0 are now measured in an increasing number of organic field - effect transistors ( ofets ) based on single crystals @xcite .",
    "such values are orders of magnitude lower than those attainable in inorganic semiconductors , and are indicative of extremely short electronic mean - free paths  on the order of the inter - molecular distances @xcite  causing a breakdown of the basic assumptions underlying band transport .",
    "this occurs despite the relatively modest coupling of the carriers with intra - molecular vibrations , which rules out the presence of polarons in such materials.@xcite it is currently believed that the mobility in crystalline organic semiconductors is intrinsically limited by the presence of large thermal molecular motions , which are a direct consequence of the weak van der waals inter - molecular bonds .",
    "@xcite deviations from the perfect crystalline arrangement act as a dynamical source of disorder on the already narrow electronic bands arising from the @xmath1-intermolecular overlaps , inducing a localization of the electronic wavefunctions on the timescale of the inter - molecular vibrations themselves@xcite  a phenomenon that is not described by the semiclassical boltzmann theory of electron - phonon scattering , nor by the classical marcus electron transfer theory .",
    "theories based on such `` transient electron localization '' @xcite are able to explain the power - law decrease of the mobility with temperature observed in ultrapure organic semiconductors @xcite as well as the optical conductivity data available in ofets @xcite .    experimentally , the intrinsic mobility of organic semiconductors is still difficult to observe in practical ofet devices .",
    "even when polaronic self - trapping @xcite and dipolar disorder@xcite induced by the interface polarizability are avoided by using non - polar gate dielectrics or suspended samples , the carrier mobility in ofets is still affected by extrinsic sources of disorder , related to the presence of structural defects or to the interface roughness .",
    "extrinsic disorder favors the formation of trapped states in the band tails , at energies located below those of the intrinsic carriers @xcite . as a result ,",
    "depending on the device quality , a crossover from an intrinsic transport regime to a thermally activated ( trapped ) regime is observed upon lowering the temperature @xcite , or the intrinsic regime can be completely washed out if the disorder is sufficiently strong as occurs in polycrystalline films .",
    "@xcite    as is clear from the above discussion , a proper description of the transport mechanism in both pure and disordered osc requires a method that ( i ) goes beyond both boltzmann and marcus approaches and ( ii ) is able to describe the interplay between highly conducting states in the band range and weakly mobile states induced by disorder .",
    "this is achieved here by applying a recently developed theory of charge transport based on the kubo formula for the electrical conductivity combined with a suitable relaxation time approximation ( rta ) on the current - current correlation function , which takes quantum localization effects into account .",
    "@xcite the present method has already been successfully applied to analyze the quantum transport properties of quasicrystals@xcite and to address the role of defects in graphene@xcite .",
    "it has also been shown to provide an efficient description of the transient localization phenomenon in pure osc@xcite , as it gives access to the _ time - resolved _ diffusivity and localization length of electronic states . by addressing the same quantities _ resolved in energy _ , we show here that this theoretical framework also establishes a direct relationship between the existence of competing electronic states at different energy scales and the resulting transport properties . accordingly , both the intrinsic transport mechanism of clean organic semiconductors and the crossover to a thermally activated motion in the presence of extrinsic disorder are rationalized in terms of the relative weight played by strongly localized tail states and more mobile electronic states in the band range .",
    "the increase of the mobility observed in ofets upon injecting a sufficiently large density of carriers is also naturally explained within this scenario .",

    "the idea here is to find an alternative reference system to start with , so that quantum localization effects are built - in from the beginning .",
    "we now show that this can be achieved by starting from the exact description of a `` parent '' localized system where the disorder is assumed to be static .",
