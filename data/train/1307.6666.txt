    "@xmath2 is characterized by the dynamics on this fiber , the _ limit dynamics_. in all the cases , we will assume that the limit dynamics is very simple , that is : either ( a ) the fiber @xmath2 contains a global attractor , see proposition [ propoprob1attractor ] ; ( b ) the fiber is filled by fixed points , theorem [ propoprob1identitatv2](a ) ; or ( c ) it is filled by @xmath4-periodic orbits , theorem [ propoprob1identitatv2](b ) .",
    "observe that there is no need to consider the case in which there is a global repellor on the fiber @xmath2 , since in this situation it is clear that any orbit with initial conditions in the basin of attraction of this fiber is unbounded ( otherwise there should be accumulation points in the fiber ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ main ] we present the main results ( proposition [ propoprob1attractor ] , theorem [ propoprob1identitatv2 ] and corollary [ corolaridiff ] ) together with some motivating examples .",
    "the proofs are given in section [ proofs ] .",
    "section [ aplications1 ] is devoted to show some applications of the main results .",
    "for instance , in section [ quasi1 ] we study the limit dynamics of some linear quasi - homogeneous maps .",
    "the example considered there shows that , for this class of maps , the shape of the basins of attraction of the origin can have a certain level of complexity .    in section [ secondordermultiplicative ]",
    "we apply our results to study the global dynamics of difference equations of multiplicative type @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being a @xmath17 function . in particular , we reobtain the results in @xcite concerning the difference equations @xmath18 the more general recurrences @xmath19 are studied in section [ higher ] .",
    "we also apply the results to study the additive difference equations @xmath20 in section  [ aplications3 ] .    finally , we also present several different type of recurrences for which the theory developed in this work applies in order to obtain a full characterization of their dynamics .",
    "we started motivated by the following clarifying example , inspired in the ones developed for continuous systems in @xcite ( a particular case is also considered in @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite ) , which shows that there are systems of type @xmath21 with @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 is a global limit fiber , having a global attractor for the restricted dynamics on @xmath23 , but having unbounded orbits @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , in their the global dynamics .",

    "the dynamics is the following : the origin is attractive if @xmath30 ; the fiber is a continuum of fixed points if @xmath31 ; and the fiber is a continuum of @xmath4periodic orbits if @xmath32 .",
    "however , as shown in proposition [ propocascurios ] , if @xmath33 then there are initial conditions giving rise to unbounded solutions , and therefore the global dynamics is not characterized by the dynamics on the global limit fiber .    [ propocascurios ] the curve @xmath34 is invariant for system ( [ cascuriosgeneral ] ) .",
    "moreover , for any initial condition @xmath35 the associated orbit is given by @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath33 , then any initial condition @xmath35 gives rise to unbounded solutions , with @xmath25 .",

    "example a shows that , in general , for systems of type ( [ triang ] ) with terms of degree greater or equal than @xmath4 in @xmath44 , we can not expect that the global dynamics in the basin of attraction of the limit fiber @xmath23 is characterized by the dynamics on the fiber .",

    "for these systems , the possible limit dynamics that we consider are the cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) mentioned in the introduction .",
