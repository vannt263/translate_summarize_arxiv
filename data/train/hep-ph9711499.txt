    "the impressive agreement of the standard model ( sm ) predictions for the fermion  vector boson couplings with the experimental results has been a striking confirmation of the @xmath5 gauge structure of the model in that sector @xcite .",
    "however , we still lack the same accuracy tests for the structure of the bosonic sector .",
    "if the gauge and symmetry breaking sectors are invariant under the @xmath6 gauge group , the structure of the triple and quartic vector - boson is completely determined .",
    "thus a detailed study of these interactions can either confirm the local gauge invariance of the theory or indicate the existence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "presently , we have only started to probe directly the triple gauge ",
    "boson couplings at the tevatron @xcite and lep @xcite through the production of pairs of vector bosons .",
    "notwithstanding , the constraints on these couplings are still very loose .",
    "future hadron @xcite and @xmath0 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 @xcite colliders will provide further information on these couplings and improve significantly our knowledge of possible anomalous gauge - boson interactions .",
    "if the @xmath3 symmetry of the model is to be linearly realized , these studies of the triple gauge  boson couplings will be able to furnish information on the gauge  boson four  point functions provided that dimension 8 and higher anomalous operators are suppressed .",
    "this is the case when the breaking of the @xmath9 symmetry takes place via the higgs mechanism with a relatively light elementary higgs boson . if , on the other hand , no fundamental light higgs particle is present in the theory , one is led to consider the most general effective lagrangian which employs a nonlinear representation of the broken @xmath3 gauge symmetry . in this case",
    "the relation between the structure of the three and four  point functions of the gauge bosons does not hold already at @xmath4 order , leaving open the question of the structure of the quartic vector  boson interactions .    at present the only information on quartic gauge  boson interactions",
    "is obtained _ indirectly _ as they modify the gauge  boson two  point functions at one loop @xcite .",
    "the precise electroweak measurements both at low energy and at the @xmath10 pole , constrains the quartic anomalous couplings to be smaller than @xmath11@xmath12 depending on the coupling .    direct studies of quartic vector  boson interactions can not be performed at the present colliders since the available centre - of - mass energy is not high enough for multiple vector  boson production .",
    "this crucial test of the gauge structure of the sm will only be possible at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) through the reaction @xmath13 @xcite or at the next linear collider ( nlc ) through the processes @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , and @xmath19 @xcite , where @xmath20 @xmath10 , @xmath21 or @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 or @xmath25 .    in this work",
    "we analyze in detail the processes @xmath26 and @xmath2 in order to assess the potential of the nlc , with and without polarized beams , to study anomalous quartic couplings of vector bosons .",
    "these reactions will be the most important processes to study the quartic gauge couplings at the nlc up to energies of the order of 1 tev , where the processes @xmath27 start to become important @xcite .",
    "we work in the framework of chiral lagrangians , and we study all @xmath4 operators that lead genuine quartic gauge interactions , _ i.e. _ these operators do not give rise to triple gauge  boson vertices , and consequently are not bounded by the study of the production of gauge  boson pairs .",

    "moreover , we also study the non - conserving @xmath28 interactions .",
    "if the electroweak symmetry breaking is due to a heavy ( strongly interacting ) higgs boson , which can be effectively removed from the physical low  energy spectrum , or to no fundamental higgs scalar at all , one is led to consider the most general effective lagrangian which employs a nonlinear representation of the broken @xmath29 gauge symmetry @xcite .",

    "one must first fix the symmetry breaking pattern .",

    "[ sig : wwz ] , we present our results after the cuts on @xmath94 and @xmath95 , but before @xmath68 and @xmath10 identification . therefore , these results should be multiplied by the efficiencies given in table [ t : wwz ] .",

    "we can witness that the sm contributions are a slowly varying functions of the center  of  mass energy , while the anomalous contributions grow rapidly , as one could naively expect .",
    "moreover , the sm background can be efficiently reduced using right  handed electrons as this polarization eliminates almost completely the contribution where the @xmath101 couples directly to the @xmath88 fermion line .    in order to quantify the effect of the new couplings",
    ", we defined the statistical significance @xmath102 of the anomalous signal @xmath103 which can be easily evaluated using the parametrization ( [ base ] ) with the coefficients given in table [ sig : wwz ] . in the above expression @xmath104 stands for the detection efficiencies presented in table [ t : wwz ] .",
    "table [ l : wwz ] contains the values of the quartic anomalous couplings that lead to an increase in the total number of events smaller than @xmath105 , assuming an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath78 and that only one anomalous coupling is non - vanishing .",

    "this result is in agreement with ref .",
    "moreover , the bounds improve as the center  of  mass energy increases since the anomalous contributions grow with energy . in general , more than one anomalous coupling might be non - vanishing . in this case the correlation among the anomalous couplings can be easily taken into account using the full expression of eq .",
    "( [ base ] ) and table [ sig : wwz ] .    in order to discriminate between the different couplings we studied the kinematical distributions of the final gauge bosons .",
    "figure [ f : wwz ] displays the @xmath106 invariant mass spectrum and the @xmath107 distribution of the @xmath10 in the @xmath80 production with unpolarized beams at @xmath108 gev .",
    "we plotted in this figure the standard model prediction ( dotted line ) as well as the predictions for @xmath109 ( dashed line ) and @xmath110 ( solid line ) , which are the values that lead to a @xmath105 signal in the total number of events for unpolarized beams .",
    "as we can see , the @xmath106 invariant mass distribution for @xmath98 presents a larger contribution at small values of the @xmath106 invariant mass , while @xmath96 gives rise to more events with larger invariant masses . in principle",
    "we can use this distribution not only to distinguish the anomalous couplings , but also to increase the sensitivity to the signal .",
    "however , this can only be accomplished with higher integrated luminosity . on the other hand the @xmath107 distributions of the @xmath10 are very similar in the sm and in presence of the anomalous couplings , being the only difference the larger number of events in the latter case .",
    "the production cross section for @xmath2 final states is much smaller than the one for @xmath80 , and consequently just a few fermionic topologies can be used to identify these events .",
    "we considered only the final states @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , and required three difermion systems with invariant masses compatible with the @xmath10 one according to the prescription given in eq .",
    "( [ cond : wz ] ) .",
    "we present in table [ t : zzz ] the efficiency for the reconstruction of the @xmath2 final state for the above topologies and center  of  mass energies of 0.5 and 1.0 tev .",
    "analogously to the @xmath80 case , these efficiencies are independent of the polarization of the @xmath88 .",
    "table [ sig : zzz ] contains the values of @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath112 for @xmath2 production , taking into account the @xmath94 and @xmath95 cuts , but not the reconstruction efficiencies . at @xmath4 order in chiral perturbation theory ,",
    "all the anomalous interactions are proportional to each other since there is only one possible lorentz structure for the vertex which is multiplied by @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , we only present the results for @xmath98 , being straightforward the generalization to the other cases . from this table",
    "we can see that most of the reconstructed @xmath2 events will be observed in the @xmath81 and @xmath83 topologies .",
    "furthermore , the largest anomalous contribution comes from @xmath112 , being the interference with the sm of the same order of the sm contribution but with the opposite sign .",
    "analogously , in @xmath80 production , the anomalous contributions grow substantially with the increase of the center  of  mass energy , while the sm cross section decreases slightly .",
    "we present in table [ l : zzz ] the @xmath105 allowed for genuinely quartic couplings that can be obtained from the non observation of deviations from the sm in @xmath2 production . in our analysis of the @xmath81 topology , we included as background the @xmath81 events coming from @xmath80 that are identified as @xmath2 . despite the reduced number of events in the @xmath2 channel , the bounds on the quartic couplings are at least a factor of 2 better than the ones drawn from the @xmath80 channel due to the smaller size of the background .",
    "on the other hand , contrary to the @xmath80 channel beam polarization does not lead to a substantial improvement on the attainable limits .",

    "[ f : zzz ] the pseudorapidity and transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath10 s in unpolarized @xmath2 production at @xmath114 gev .",
    "as we can see , the anomalous quartic interactions leads to more centrally produced @xmath10 s ( smaller @xmath115 ) which have a slightly harder @xmath107 spectrum .",

    "the most @xmath116 becomes important process @xcite .",
    "we showed in this work that the nlc will be able to uncover the existence of anomalous quartic couplings of the order @xmath117 for center  of  mass energies up to 1 tev and an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath78 ; see tables [ l : wwz ] and [ l : zzz ] . despite these limits being weaker or of the order of the present indirect bounds @xcite",
    ", the above processes will provide a _",
    "direct _ test of the quartic interactions among the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "we have also shown that the use of a right  handed polarized electron beam leads to better limits on the anomalous interactions from the @xmath80 production due to the substantial reduction of the sm backgrounds .",
    "it is also important to devise a strategy to disentangle the anomalous couplings in case a departure from the sm prediction is observed . in @xmath80 production ,",
    "the analysis of the @xmath106 invariant mass distribution , see fig .",
    "[ f : wwz ] , can be used to distinguish between the two possible structures for the @xmath67 vertex , one associated to @xmath118 and the other related to @xmath119 .",
    "however , we are still left some two possibilities in both cases . at this point",
    "it is important to use the information from the @xmath2 reaction , because the @xmath28 violating interactions leads to a much larger excess of events for the same value of the anomalous coupling , due to the coupling structure @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , the combination of the @xmath106 distribution and the total number of events in both reactions are a powerful tool to separate the effects of the different anomalous couplings provided there is enough statistics .",
    "moreover , the comparison between the @xmath80 event rates for different polarizations can also be used to further distinguish between the couplings @xmath118 and @xmath119 , since the latter are less sensitive to the electron polarization .",
