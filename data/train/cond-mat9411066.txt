    "a number of recent works  @xcite have proposed a description of the low temperature spin dynamics of strongly correlated electronic systems using their proximity to an actual or hypothetical zero temperature , magnetic , quantum phase transition .",
    "such an approach has the advantage of allowing development of a systematic expansion about a point with non - trivial spin correlations and with strongly interacting excitations .",
    "some of these proposals have arisen in the context of two - dimensional interacting electron models of the doped cuprate superconductors , while others considered the heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "the ideas of this paper will be presented in the former context , although our approach may be of a more general utility .",
    "we begin our discussion by reviewing two recent complementary approaches to magnetic quantum transitions in the cuprate compounds .",
    "a unified picture of spin fluctuations in the lightly - doped cuprates obtained from these past approaches , and our present work , is provided towards the end of this paper in sec .",
    "we wish to emphasize at the outset that all of the discussion in this paper refers to spin fluctuations associated with _ commensurate _",
    "antiferromagnetic ordering ; for the cuprates this corresponds to an ordering wavevector @xmath6 .",
    "we have little to say here about the case of incommensurate ordering .",
    "the first approach begins from the insulating parent compound , like @xmath7 , whose spin fluctuations can be modeled by a spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice  @xcite .",
    "the low energy excitations of the antiferromagnet are believed to be well - described by a continuum @xmath8 non - linear sigma model field theory .",
    "the non - linear sigma model is parameterized by a single coupling constant , @xmath9 , which measures the strength of quantum fluctuations in the system ; for @xmath10 , the system has nel order , while for @xmath11 , it is in the quantum disordered phase .",
    "the transition at @xmath12 has been studied in some detail  @xcite  it has dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 and leads to a quantum disordered phase in which at @xmath4 the low energy magnon excitations have a gap and an infinite lifetime .",
    "the current experimental and theoretical consensus is that the @xmath13 heisenberg antiferromagnet has macroscopic neel order in the ground state , and therefore should map onto a sigma model with @xmath14 .",
    "now consider doping this antiferromagnet with a small number of holes . at very small",
    "doping , the holes form small elliptical pockets at @xmath15 and symmetry related points in the magnetic brillouin zone  @xcite .",
    "quantum fluctuations associated with these holes decrease the spin stiffness of the antiferromagnet  @xcite and should therefore drive the effective value of @xmath9 closer to the quantum transition point at @xmath16 .",
    "( we are assuming here that conditions are such that there is a direct transition from a commensurate long - range ordered state to a commensurate quantum - disordered state with increasing doping  @xcite ; we are neglecting the possibility of an intermediate incommensurate long - range ordered state  @xcite ) .",
    "suppose that quantum fluctuations are strong enough that the disordering transition occurs while the holes still occupy small pockets .",
    "the critical properties of such a transition were studied by one of us  @xcite in the framework of the shraiman - siggia model  @xcite : it was found that the dynamic critical exponent remained at @xmath0 , and the mobile charge carriers only introduced a small , but negligible damping of the magnon excitations at the critical point .",
    "the full structure of the quantum disordered phase in this model , and in particular , the topology of its fermi surface is not well understood : we will discuss these issues further in sec  [ secss ] .",
    "the second approach begins with the opposite limit of large doping , where the dilute system of electrons is presumably well described as a fermi liquid . using mean - field spin - density - wave ideas , a scenario for the onset of antiferromagnetic order in such a fermi liquid",
    "was proposed many years ago by hertz  @xcite , and extended recently by millis  @xcite .",
    "it turns out to be important to distinguish two cases  @xcite depending upon the value the ordering wavevector @xmath17 ( for our case @xmath18 ) , and the shape of the fermi surface in the quantum - disordered phase . + _ ( a ) damping of spin excitations with momenta near @xmath17 , due to conversion into particle - hole pairs ,",
    "is forbidden : _ this is the case when @xmath17 can not connect two points on the fermi surface . for a circular fermi surface",
    "this corresponds to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fermi wavevector .",
    "the transition then has the mean - field exponent @xmath0 and is rather similar to the discussion above on the first approach .",
    "the scaling results of ref .",
    "@xcite apply mostly unchanged : some simple modifications are necessary for the uniform susceptibility , and are discussed in sec .",
    "[ secunisus ] + _ ( b ) damping of spin excitations with momenta near @xmath17 , due to conversion into particle - hole pairs , is allowed : _ this is the case when @xmath17 can connect two points on the fermi surface , which for a circular fermi surface corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "this transition has @xmath2 in mean - field theory . accordingly , the magnon excitations in the quantum disordered phase are overdamped and relaxational",
    ".    we will not discuss the special case @xmath22 in this paper .",
    "a phenomenological form for the magnetic susceptibility near a type @xmath3 transition was introduced in context of cuprate superconductors by millis , monien and pines  @xcite to explain nmr data in @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath0 to @xmath2 crossover with doping was later proposed by pines and one of us  @xcite and by barzykin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to describe evolution of the experimental nmr and neutron scattering data with oxygen concentration for @xmath24 .",
    "very recently , liu and su  @xcite considered a two - component `` kondo - lattice''-type model of the cuprates , with separate localized spin and itinerant electron degrees of freedom .",
    "they assumed conditions that were appropriate to have a type @xmath3 phase transition with @xmath2 , and found behavior characteristic of this value of @xmath25 at the lowest energies or temperatures . at higher temperatures however , they found a crossover to behavior characteristic of @xmath0 .",
    "earlier , the temperature - induced crossover to the @xmath0 regime was discussed in ref @xcite in relation to @xmath26 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this crossover is in fact a rather general phenomenon for type b systems  there will always be reactive terms @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is a measuring frequency ) in spin response functions which will overwhelm dissipative terms at large enough @xmath28 .",
    "the crossover should be especially pronounced in systems where the damping constant , @xmath29 , is small .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to discuss the scaling properties of the quantum disordered phase of systems near transitions of type @xmath3 .",
    "we will also make a few comments about type @xmath1 systems to which the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite will mostly apply .",
    "we will assume that conditions in the type @xmath3 system are such that the higher energy crossover to type @xmath1 behavior occurs at energies which are significantly smaller than other high energy cutoffs like the fermi energy or the exchange constant .",
    "( for type @xmath3 systems which violate this condition , our results reproduce the correct asymptotic critical singularities , but make a particular choice for numerical scale - factors which are in fact non - universal in this case ; these statements will be made more precise later ) .",
    "we also assume , of course , that no other unrelated low energy scale appears .",
    "we will propose a scaling hypothesis , in which the wavevector ( @xmath30 ) , frequency ( @xmath28 ) , and temperature ( @xmath31 ) dependence of the staggered spin susceptibility can be expressed in terms of a scaling function which involves only four experimentally determinable , @xmath4 input parameters . only these four parameters are dependent on the details of the microscopic interactions in the ground state ; everything else is universal and can , in principle , be computed in a long distance field theory .",
    "the general scaling arguments will be presented in the sec  [ secscalinganalysis ] .",
    "the crossover behavior of the uniform susceptibility and the specific heat is somewhat more complicated and requires additional microscopic parameters  this is discussed in secs  [ secunisus ] and  [ secspecificheat ] .",
    "we will then illustrate these scaling ideas in two model calculations .    in section  [ sdw ]",
    "we consider magnetic phase transitions in a standard spin - density - wave ( sdw ) formalism .",
    "we will examine a simple model  a hubbard model with first ( @xmath32 ) and second neighbor hopping ( @xmath33 ) for the fermions , which displays a transition of either type @xmath1 or type @xmath3 , depending on the ratio @xmath34 .",
    "note that in both cases , the fermi surface in the quantum - disordered phase is large ( _ i.e. _ encloses a volume given by the total number of electrons ) .",
    "the sdw results for the magnetic susceptibility will illustrate the important differences in the nature of the spin excitations between type @xmath1 and @xmath3 transitions .",
    "the sdw theory will also be used to obtain new mean - field results for critical properties on the magnetically ordered side of the transition .",
    "finally , we will briefly discuss the relation between the sdw results and those for the fluctuation - driven magnetic transition within the shraiman - siggia model .    in section  [ largen",
    "] , we first use the results of section  [ sdw ] to motivate a model field theory , @xmath35 , to describe the quantum - disordered phase in case @xmath3 and its crossover to type @xmath1 behavior . the model",
    "@xmath35 , which relies on a mean - field approximation for the fermions , will turn out to be precisely the one proposed by liu and su  @xcite ; we caution however that the validity of @xmath35 as a description of the underlying fermionic excitations has not been conclusively established asymptotically close to the critical point .",
    "we will use a large @xmath5 expansion to compute explicit results for the crossover scaling functions of @xmath35 .",
    "finally in section  [ conc ] we will discuss the experimental relevance of our results and state our main conclusions .",
    "we now present some general scaling ideas to describe the crossover between type @xmath1 and type @xmath3 transitions . in the terminology of the well - developed theory of crossover phenomena between two critical points in classical phase transitions  @xcite",
    ", we need to distinguish between the primary and secondary fixed points : the primary fixed point has 2 relevant directions , while the secondary point has only a single , relevant direction associated with the `` thermal '' operator which drives one across the transition . in our case , it is clear that the primary fixed point is the type @xmath1 fixed point with @xmath0 .",
    "the mean - field value of @xmath0 for type @xmath1 is expected to be robust and not suffer any corrections from fluctuations , as the coupling between the spin - fluctuations and fermionic quasiparticles is quite weak in this case .",
    "adding any damping to the magnon excitations should be a relevant perturbation at this fixed point as it introduces additional low energy excitations ( it could be dangerously irrelevant , a possibility which we shall briefly refer to later , but not explore in any detail ) . the coupling , analogous to @xmath9 , which tunes the system across the transition is the other relevant perturbation .",
    "the type @xmath3 fixed point must therefore be secondary .",
    "( we are also assuming here that the effect of the damping is associated with only a _",
    "single _ relevant operator ; there could be more than one .",
    "it should be easy to extend the following scaling analysis to this case , but we shall not do it in the interests of simplicity ) .",
    "an important feature of the standard crossover theory  @xcite is that the crossover scaling functions between the two fixed points are expressed in terms of eigenoperators and exponents of the primary fixed point , while the critical singularities of the secondary fixed point appear as nonanalytic behavior in the crossover functions themselves .",
    "this result forms the basis of our analysis below .",
    "we will restrict our scaling results below to the to the quantum disordered side of the transition .",
    "we begin our discussion by introducing the four parameters which will characterize the quantum - disordered ground state ; the finite temperature properties of the staggered spin susceptibility , @xmath36 , will then be described by universal scaling functions of these four parameters only .",
    "imagine we have available , either through experiments or computer simulations , the @xmath4 value of the imaginary part of the local , on - site , dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath37 of the system of interest ; the local susceptibility is obtained by integrating the dynamic susceptibility over momenta in the vicinity of @xmath17 ( where it equals @xmath38 ) . in an insulating antiferromagnet , whose transition is described completely by the primary , @xmath0 fixed point , @xmath39 would have the form shown in fig  [ fig1]a  @xcite : there is gap below which the spectral density is strictly zero , a discontinuity at the gap , and for large @xmath28 we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 is an anomalous dimension of the @xmath0 fixed point  @xcite . here , by large @xmath28 , we mean frequencies which are large compared to the spin fluctuation energy scale , but small compared to upper cutoffs like the an exchange constant or the fermi energy ; this and similar restrictions will be implicitly assumed in the remainder of the paper .",
    "let us now examine the change in the spectrum due to a relevant perturbation which moves the system towards the secondary , type @xmath3 , fixed point . under appropriate conditions",
    ", mobile fermionic carriers can act as such a perturbation , and the damping due to the particle - hole continuum will introduce some sub - gap absorption : @xmath39 will then look like fig  [ fig1]b .",
    "the gap has turned into a pseudo - gap , and @xmath42 for small @xmath28 .",
    "however , we will still have @xmath43 for large @xmath28 as the primary fixed point behavior is expected to continue to hold at large @xmath28 .",
    "we now extract three parameters from this form for @xmath39 : + ( _ i _ ) an overall amplitude @xmath44 : this is defined by @xmath45 the factor of 4 is for convenience in a later model calculation .",
    "+ ( _ ii _ ) and ( _ iii _ ) two energy scales , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which measure the pseudogap and the strength of the damping respectively . these are obtained by solving the constraints @xmath48 the factor of 8 in the first equation is chosen to be exactly twice the factor 4 in ( [ defz ] ) ; the factor of @xmath49 in the second equation is arbitrary and is for future convenience .",
    "the parameter @xmath50 is the energy below which the anomalous scaling of the primary fixed point @xmath51 stops , and a convenient choice is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is of order , but larger than , unity . the factors of @xmath54 above also ensure that @xmath46 and @xmath47 have units of energy . because of the tiny value of @xmath55 , the @xmath54 can be dropped while determining @xmath47 and @xmath46 from data ; this is however not true in any analytical computation of scaling functions , as they are essential in canceling cut - off dependencies and obtaining a universal result .",
    "the pseudo - gap @xmath46 has therefore been defined as the frequency at which @xmath56 falls to half its large frequency value ( modulo factors of @xmath54 ) , while @xmath47 is determined from the sub - gap absorption . for @xmath57 , @xmath46 is roughly the location of the knee in @xmath58 , while @xmath47 is its width ( see fig  [ fig1]b ) ; however , the definitions above hold for all @xmath59 . for very small @xmath47 , when the system is very close to the primary fixed point , @xmath47 and @xmath46 measure the strength of the two relevant perturbations away from it ; this is no longer true for large @xmath60 , but our scaling results below will continue to be valid . + ( _ iv _ ) the final parameter sets the normalization of length scales .",
    "a convenient choice is to use the @xmath4 spin wave velocity , @xmath61 , defined by the @xmath30 dependence of the peak in the imaginary part of the staggered spin susceptibility @xmath62 at large @xmath30 ( in all expressions for @xmath36 _ only _ , it is implicitly assumed that wavevectors , @xmath30 , are deviations from the ordering wavevector @xmath17 ) .    scaling functions of the primary @xmath0 fixed point",
    "were studied in some detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we can easily extend that analysis to write down the crossover scaling functions for the present case .",
    "the main difference is that we have a new relevant parameter , @xmath47 , which must be included in the scaling functions .",
    "we consider only case of the scaling function of the staggered susceptibility , @xmath36 , here , leaving for later other observables which have a somewhat more complicated crossover behavior .",
    "using the fact that @xmath47 was defined above to have the dimensions of energy , we can write @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a fully universal , dimensionless crossover function , and the dimensionless arguments measure values of the parameters in units of @xmath65 : thus @xmath66 all letter exponents @xmath41 , @xmath67 ( to be used later ) refer to the primary fixed point .",
    "the main condition for the validity of ( [ cross ] ) is that the five energy scales , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath65 are all significantly smaller than upper cutoffs like the fermi energy or an exchange constant .",
    "the ratios of the five energy scales can however be arbitrary .    at @xmath70",
    ", @xmath71 reduces to the result of ref  @xcite ( there are some minor differences in conventions ) , and we obtain the scaling function for case @xmath1 .",
    "the criticality of the secondary fixed point appears in the @xmath72 limit",
    ". then @xmath64 should collapse into a secondary scaling function @xmath73  @xcite with the @xmath74 argument removed .",
    "the other arguments , and the overall scale , of @xmath64 will be multiplied by powers of @xmath74 , so that @xmath73 and its arguments have scaling dimensions appropriate to the secondary fixed point .",
    "to illustrate this point more clearly , let us assume that the structure of the type @xmath3 fixed point is identical to the gaussian @xmath2 fixed point obtained in spin - density - wave mean - field theory ; then we will have @xmath75 the logarithmic corrections arise because the @xmath2 critical point has marginal perturbations in @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "it is however important to note that these logarithmic corrections , and indeed the entire leading critical behavior of the secondary fixed point , are contained completely within the primary universal scaling function @xmath64 .",
    "everything about the logarithmic terms is universal and , in particular , there is no non - universal cutoff - dependent argument to the logarithms .",
    "this universality is a key point , and is a consequence of our earlier choice to define the scaling functions with respect to the primary fixed point . in systems with @xmath47 so large that it is greater than a high energy cutoff like the fermi energy , this strong universality will not hold ; however , the large @xmath47 limit of @xmath64 can still be used to describe the critical behavior , with the understanding that the various numerical scale factors are not correct as they are now non - universal .",
    "the remainder of the paper will make the rather abstract arguments of section  [ intro ] concrete by presenting explicit calculations in some simple models .",
    "we start with the mean - field sdw theory of the disordering transition in doped antiferromagnets . the simplest model which displays",
    "such transition is a one - band hubbard model given by @xmath77 here @xmath78 and @xmath79 label the nearest and the next - nearest neighbors , respectively , and @xmath80 is the particle density . depending on the density of carriers and the ratio @xmath81 , the fermi surface of free electrons can either be closed , in which case it is centered at @xmath82 and located entirely inside the magnetic brillouin zone , or it can be an open fermi surface which crosses the magnetic brillouin zone boundary ( fig .",
    "[ fermi - surface ] ) .",
    "we will not specify the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 for which the fermi surface is open or closed for a particular doping concentration , but rather consider the critical behavior of the dynamic spin susceptibility in both cases .",
    "let us assume that the model has commensurate antiferromagnetic long - range order down to a transition point ( this assumption may not hold for a particular choice of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , but it should always hold for related models with additional momentum dependence in @xmath83  @xcite ; this momentum dependence however does not lead to new physics near the transition , and we will not consider this complication here ) .",
    "the @xmath84 ordering implies that , e.g. , the @xmath25 component of the spin - density operator , @xmath85 , has a nonzero expectation value at @xmath86 . in the sdw approach  @xcite , the relation @xmath87 , is used to decouple the quartic term in ( [ hub ] ) . after decoupling and diagonalization of the quadratic form ,",
    "one obtains  @xcite @xmath88 where primes on the summation signs indicate that it is over the reduced magnetic brillouin zone , and we introduced @xmath89 where @xmath90 , and @xmath91",
    ". we will refer to the quasiparticles described by @xmath61 and @xmath92 operators as conduction and valence fermions , respectively .",
    "finally , the self - consistency condition on @xmath93 is @xmath94 below we will assume that @xmath33 is negative .",
    "this is consistent with numerical calculations  @xcite and fits to the measured  @xcite shape of fermi surface for @xmath95 .",
    "we now describe the evolution of the fermi surface with doping .",
    "the shape of the fermi surface is determined from @xmath96 . at half - filling ,",
    "the system is an insulator ( @xmath97 ) , all valence band states are occupied and all conduction band states are empty . at finite doping , the chemical potential moves into the valence band .",
    "as the maximum of @xmath98 is located at @xmath15 and symmetry related points , the fermi surface first opens in the form of hole pockets located around these points ( fig  [ evol_fs]a ) .",
    "the subsequent evolution of of the fermi surface with doping in the sdw phase depends on the ratio @xmath81 . for sufficiently large @xmath99 , the bottom of the conduction band also becomes smaller than @xmath100 above some particular doping concentration , and electron pockets appear in the conduction band ( fig  [ evol_fs]b ) .",
    "the energy gap between the hole and electron pockets shrinks gradually as @xmath101 decreases , and , at the transition point , the electron and hole pockets merge at @xmath102 and symmetry related points , where @xmath103 , and the value of @xmath104 is determined from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ self_consist ] ) with @xmath105 ( fig  [ evol_fs]c ) .",
    "it can be verified that this transition is of type @xmath3 , and @xmath17 can span two points on the fermi surface in the paramagnetic phase . for small enough @xmath99",
    ", the situation is different : the size of hole pockets continues to increase with doping , and at some concentration @xmath106 , the hole pockets extend to @xmath107 and related points while magnetic order is still present ( fig  [ evol_fs]d ) . at concentrations smaller than @xmath106 , electron pockets",
    "either do not appear at all , or they first appear , their size passes through a maximum , and then they disappear at some doping concentration @xmath108 . at some concentration @xmath109 ,",
    "the long - range order finally disappears , but the fermi surface at the transition is located inside magnetic brillouin zone boundary ( fig  [ evol_fs]e ) .",
    "the disordering transition is therefore of type @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we now present results from a mean - field sdw calculation of the uniform and staggered susceptibilities ; details can be found in the appendix .",
    "we shall mainly be interested in the small @xmath30 and @xmath28 behavior of these responses when @xmath101 is small .",
    "we shall find that an important feature of type @xmath3 systems is that the limits @xmath110 and @xmath105 do not commute .",
    "we consider the two cases separately .",
    "the transverse , staggered , susceptibility is found to behave as @xmath111 where @xmath112 are constants ( _ i.e. _ finite as @xmath105 ) and @xmath113 is a spin stiffness .",
    "it is clear that the damping is negligible as @xmath105 , and that the limits @xmath110 and @xmath105 do commute .",
    "the susceptibility is also that expected for a @xmath0 system .    in the quantum disordered phase we then have @xmath114 , where the gap @xmath46 vanishes at the transition point .",
    "the pole in @xmath36 corresponds to a positive energy , spin-1 particle - hole bound state which has center of mass momentum near @xmath17 , and which lies below the bottom of the particle - hole continuum at these momenta .",
    "the transverse , uniform susceptibility at @xmath105 can be represented as a sum of the interband and intraband contributions @xmath115 where we found that @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "so @xmath118 is finite at the transition , as it should be when reaching a fermi liquid .",
    "however , the assertion by millis  @xcite that the spin - wave velocity should be given by a hydrodynamic expression  @xcite @xmath119 is seen to be incorrect : @xmath120 is in fact finite at the transition .",
    "the correct relationship actually turns out to be @xmath121 .",
    "the non - commutativity of the limits @xmath110 and @xmath122 now leads to much more complex behavior than for type @xmath1 .",
    "consider first , the transverse , staggered susceptibility at @xmath123 ; in this case a relatively complete evaluation is possible , and we find @xmath124^{-1 } \\label{freq}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 .",
    "the first , singular term arises from interband processes and is due to the integration over the region of momentum space where the fermi surface crosses the magnetic brillouin zone boundary ; there is no such point for type @xmath1 systems .",
    "the second term is the regular contribution from the reminder of the momentum space , it is similar to that found in type @xmath1 systems .",
    "it is clear that the behavior of @xmath125 is dramatically different for @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the @xmath30 dependence of @xmath125 only has a relatively simple form in the limiting regions .",

    "we see that the the lowest - energy excitations are overdamped even in the magnetically ordered phase , although we indeed have a goldstone mode at @xmath123 .",
    "also , the renormalized spin - wave velocity ( defined in the limit of small @xmath131 ) decreases as @xmath135 . in the opposite limit , @xmath136 ( and for all @xmath137 at the transition point ) both terms in the last bracket in ( [ chisperpb1 ] ) become imaginary , and we find @xmath138 the magnon excitations are now clearly overdamped . in the sdw approximation we found that @xmath29 _ does not _",
    "depend on the ratio @xmath139 . in the quantum disordered phase",
    "we then have @xmath140 where @xmath46 is now a pseudo - gap and vanishes at the transition point .",

    "the same form of susceptibility was proposed earlier by barzykin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite on phenomenological grounds .",
    "we will use eqn .",
    "( [ chisperpb3 ] ) below to motivate the field - theory for the critical point and the paramagnetic phase .    as for type @xmath1 , the transverse",
    ", uniform susceptibility is found to have two contributions from interband and intraband processes which now take the form @xmath141 where now @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "again , @xmath118 is finite at the transition , and the relationship  @xcite @xmath144 does not work as it would predict @xmath145 .",
    "the correct relationship is @xmath146 . in practice , however , it is difficult to find conditions when one can neglect the @xmath131 term in ( [ chisperpb1 ] ) .",
    "magnon excitations are then overdamped , and the issue of the behavior of the spin - wave velocity near the transition is not that relevant .",
    "notice also that as shown in the appendix , the @xmath147 contributions in @xmath148 and @xmath149 cancel each other , so that @xmath150 .",
    "the main weakness of the above mean - field sdw computations is that they underestimate the contribution of magnetic fluctuations , which may destroy long - range order at a smaller doping .",
    "such fluctuations may be more completely accounted for by studying the phase transition in the shraiman - siggia ( ss ) model  @xcite , which however has other weaknesses to be described below . in this subsection",
    "we will review the results of such a study  @xcite , compare them with the above sdw results , and make some speculations on how they may be reconciled .",
    "readers not interested in this issue can skip this subsection without any loss of continuity .",
    "the ss model is a continuum theory of interactions between mobile holes and spin fluctuations in a @xmath32-@xmath151 model _",
    "i.e. _ a model in which strong local repulsion between electrons allows one to project out states with more than a single - electron on a site . in the language of the hubbard model",
    ", there is a significant band - gap between the lower and upper hubbard bands , and the ss model focuses exclusively on physics within the lower band .",
    "the lower and upper hubbard bands can be identified with the valence and conduction bands , respectively , of the sdw theory discussed above .",
    "furthermore , in the sdw mean - field theory , the minimum , direct band - gap between the conduction and valence bands is proportional to the nel order parameter @xmath101 , and therefore vanishes when long - range order disappears .",
    "this is , however , not the case in the ss model , in which @xmath101 and the band - gap are independent parameters , and the band - gap is assumed to remain finite at the point where @xmath101 vanishes .",
    "this is a key difference between the two approaches .",
    "let us now approach the magnetic transition from the ordered side in the ss model .",
    "a simple computation , similar to those in ref  @xcite , shows that the transverse , staggered susceptibility has precisely the form ( [ chisperpa1 ] ) obtained above in the sdw theory of a type a transition ; in particular the result @xmath152 is also obtained in the ss model ( thus the proper interpretation of the factor of @xmath153 in ( [ chisperpa1 ] ) in the sdw theory is that of the square of the magnetization order parameter , rather than the valence / conduction band gap ) . at the point where @xmath101 vanishes",
    ", computations in the ss model show that  @xcite @xmath154 . in the mean - field sdw theory above we have @xmath155 with no damping term ; however it is quite reasonable to expect that including higher - order paramagnon fluctuation corrections in the sdw theory will lead to a damping term rather similar to that obtained in the ss model .",
    "so far , therefore , the spin - fluctuation properties of the magnetic transition in the ss model are essentially identical to those obtained in the sdw theory of the @xmath0 transition in type a systems .",
    "however , differences do appear when we consider the fermionic excitations .",
    "the type a transition in the sdw theory has a large electron fermi surface wholly within the magnetic brillouin zone , which changes little between the two phases on either side of the critical point . on the contrary ,",
    "the fermi surface of the ss model , on the ordered side of the critical point , consists of elliptical hole pockets at the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "the fate of the elliptical hole pockets in the quantum disordered phase of the ss model is not at all clear  @xcite .",
    "below we present a reasonable , but speculative , scenario : we propose that in this phase , the fermi surface is large ( _ i.e. _ encloses a volume equal to the total number of electrons ) , as it was in both types of sdw transitions .",
    "however the quasiparticle residue is very anisotropic so that at the transition to nel state , the residue vanishes everywhere except for the regions which surround the hole pockets in the ordered phase  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the critical theory of the @xmath0 transition in the ss model in ref  @xcite remains essentially correct .",
    "there may also be states in the hubbard gap with their residue also vanishing at the transition to nel order .",
    "if this large fermi surface intersects the magnetic brillouin zone boundary in the disordered phase , then there will be a _",
    "@xmath4 damping , @xmath29 , at @xmath123 in the quantum - disordered phase ; however @xmath29 will vanish faster than the gap , @xmath46 , as one approaches the critical point , thus behaving as a dangerously irrelevant perturbation ( i.e. , perturbation which is irrelevant very near transition but leads to a new physics at some distance away from the transition ) .",
    "alternatively , the large fermi surface with anisotropic quasiparticle residue may be entirely within the magnetic brillouin zone ; in this case the properties of the quantum disordered phase will be very similar to those of a type @xmath1 transition in sdw theory .",

    "this restriction is however not crucial and identical scaling results would be obtained in a model with a more conventional @xmath161 interaction .",

    "the first two terms in @xmath35 are those found in the usual @xmath162 non - linear sigma model .",

    "the action @xmath35 was first explicitly written down by liu and su  @xcite ",
    "they used a two - component microscopic model in which the spins and fermions are locally independent degrees of freedom , and then integrated the fermions out .",
    "we expect @xmath35 to provide a reasonable description of the temperature dependent crossovers in the quantum disordered phase .",
    "however , close enough to the critical point in the quantum disordered phase , the validity of @xmath35 appears to us to not have been established convincingly .",
    "it is likely that it will be necessary to account for fluctuations involving incipient formation of the spin - density - wave gap over portions of the fermi surface ",
    "note that these gaps form at precisely the same points on the fermi surface which are responsible for the low frequency damping on the disordered side ; these issues will be examined in more detail in subsequent work .",
    "it is also easy to see explicitly that @xmath35 certainly breaks down on the magnetically ordered side of the transition . on this side ,",
    "the spin fluctuation propagator changes substantially when @xmath30 and @xmath28 become smaller than the order parameter @xmath101 ( see e.g. , eq .",

    "[ largen ] we will focus exclusively on the model @xmath35 .",
    "we will describe its asymptotic critical behavior , and compute its scaling functions in a large @xmath5 expansion .",
    "it is also interesting to note in passing that the @xmath163 dissipation in @xmath35 is similar to that used in the macroscopic quantum tunneling literature  @xcite . there",
    "the emphasis is on the consequence of this dissipation on the quantum mechanics of a single , heavy particle , whereas we are studying its effects on a field theory describing a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "let us first discuss some general scaling properties of @xmath35 from the vantage point of the primary , @xmath0 fixed point .",
    "this fixed point clearly lies on the submanifold of the parameter space with @xmath164 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath29 is clearly a relevant perturbation at the primary fixed point .",
    "moreover , @xmath165 is non - analytic in frequency and leads to a long - range @xmath166 interaction in spacetime .",
    "theories with long - range interactions of this type are familiar in the context of finite temperature classical phase transitions  @xcite and many results can be transferred over . in particular , the @xmath167 term gets no singular loop renormalizations , and the scaling dimension of @xmath29 is exactly @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath4 , the response functions will therefore be scaling functions of the ratio @xmath169 .",
    "the fully renormalized parameters introduced earlier will have a different dependence on the bare coupling constants depending on the value of this ratio ; this dependence can be deduced by standard scaling arguments . for @xmath170 we will have dependencies characteristic of the primary fixed point for which @xmath171 in the opposite limit @xmath172 we are much closer to the critical point and dominated by the secondary behavior ; in this case we have @xmath173    explicit results for scaling functions of @xmath35 can be obtained in a @xmath174 expansion .",
    "the methods are very similar to those discussed at length in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath164 ; one only has to add a @xmath175 to each propagator .",
    "we will therefore merely present the final results . at @xmath176",

    "this is exactly what we find from ( [ meq ] ) which reduces to @xmath195 for large @xmath74 .",
    "the only violation of the @xmath194 scaling in the above comes from the logarithms , which was also expected ; the arguments of the logarithms however remain universal .",

    "the agreement of the large @xmath47 , @xmath176 results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite is also encouraging .",
    "a number of experimentally measurable quantities can be deduced from the above results .",
    "for example , the antiferromagnetic correlation length is @xmath200 and the nmr relaxation rates ( for a review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , upto known prefactors associated with hyperfine coupling constants , are  @xcite @xmath201 we plot in fig  [ xifig ] the universal crossover function for @xmath202 as a function of @xmath203 for various values of @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath199 we have two main regimes of temperature : @xmath204 regime @xmath205 is the @xmath0 quantum - critical behavior  @xcite , and @xmath206 is the @xmath0 quantum - disordered . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the damping gives rise to a power - law rather than exponential behavior of the correlation length ; these power - laws are the same as for quantum disordered , @xmath2 behavior , discussed below . however , unlike for `` pure '' @xmath2 relaxational behavior , @xmath207 has a knee at @xmath208 .",
    "based on the presence of such knee ( shown in fig.[fig1]b ) , we identify this regime as quantum disordered , @xmath0 .    for @xmath209",

    "most of the above asymptotic results are not terribly useful at any realistic value of @xmath59 , and the exact values plotted in fig  [ xifig ] should be used for experimental comparisons .",
    "the above regimes are sketched in fig  [ sketch ] , which will be discussed in sec  [ conc ] .",
    "consider now the response of the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid to a uniform magnetic field .",
    "unlike the staggered susceptibility which diverges at the transition , the uniform susceptibility , @xmath218 , is expected to remain finite . as a result ,",
    "the crossover behavior of @xmath218 is more complicated and corrections to the leading scaling result now play a significant role .",
    "the following results are for type @xmath3 systems ; however they can also be applied to type @xmath1 systems after imposing @xmath219 .",
    "we need the modifications to the action @xmath35 , in the presence of an external field @xmath220 .",
    "these corrections are equivalent to evaluating the effective 3-point and 4-point couplings between the antiferromagnetic order parameter and the uniform magnetization after integrating out the fermions ; however , as we are mainly interested in the case of a uniform field , we will just carry the exact field dependence through in all the fermion propagators ( see sec  [ stagfield ] ) .    in insulating antiferromagnets ,",
    "the coupling to the field was given exactly by a symmetry - related argument  @xcite with no additional coupling constants appearing .",
    "these symmetry arguments must now be applied with more caution because of the presence of gapless fermionic excitations in the quantum - disordered phase .",
    "in particular , we need to account for the continuous change in the fermi liquid ground state in the presence of @xmath220 associated with the expanding ( shrinking ) of the up-(down-)spin fermi surface .",
    "consider , first , the effect of @xmath220 on the @xmath167 term in @xmath35 . at small @xmath157 , this term arises from the absorption due to particle - hole pairs with momentum @xmath17 , made up of electrons and holes just above and below the fermi surface .",
    "a field , @xmath220 , will shift the bottom of the band of the up and down spins in opposite directions . in a model with a flat density of states ,",
    "such a shift should have _ no _ effect on the particle - hole spectrum .",
    "so for small @xmath220 , there is no change in the @xmath167 term . at larger @xmath220",
    "there will be a change , because there is always some structure in the density of states : this will show up as a field dependence in the value of the coupling @xmath29 : @xmath221 where @xmath222 is a small coupling .",
    "this is verified in an explicit computation of the field dependence of @xmath35 discussed in the appendix .",
    "the computation in the appendix also finds a precession term : @xmath223 where we have absorbed in the definition of @xmath220 a factor @xmath224 ( @xmath225 is the gyromagnetic factor ) .",
    "the prefactor of ( [ field ] ) has been written such that the coupling @xmath226 in the insulating limit ; in this limit the precession rate of the spins is known exactly and hence ( [ field ] ) has no new coupling constants .",
    "in the doped system , there is a correction to the precession rate from internal fields generated by the polarization of the fermions , and this is represented by the new coupling @xmath53 .",
    "if the system is not too strongly doped , we can expect that @xmath53 is not too large .    finally , there is a term ( also derived in the appendix ) , @xmath227 , which imposes an energetic preference for the relative orientation of the antiferromagnetic order parameter and the magnetic field .",
    "all three terms discussed above induce non - universal corrections in the @xmath4 value of @xmath218 .",
    "these may be interpreted as corrections to the fermionic pauli susceptibility from higher - order interactions between the paramagnon modes .",
    "things do simplify , however , when we consider the @xmath31 dependent part of @xmath218 . then the precession coupling in ( [ field ] ) turns out to be the most important in many cases .",
    "the @xmath31-dependent corrections from the @xmath228 dependence of @xmath29 can be shown by standard scaling arguments to be subdominant near the primary fixed point ; near the secondary fixed point this term turns out to have the same @xmath31 dependence as that due to ( [ field ] ) , but with a prefactor of @xmath229 .",
    "finally , the last @xmath230 term yields no temperature dependence in a model with a fixed - length constraint . in a soft - spin theory ,",
    "scaling arguments show that this term is also subdominant near the primary fixed point ; near the secondary fixed point , and going beyond @xmath176 limit for soft - length spins , one obtains a @xmath31 dependence similar to that due to the @xmath228 dependence of @xmath29 .",
    "we see therefore , that if @xmath29 is sufficiently large , all three terms contribute roughly equally to the uniform susceptibility .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath218 is then non - universal , and reliable predictions for experiments are difficult . to keep our discussion simple , and also because we think that this is most realistic experimentally",
    ", we will only present explicit results for @xmath218 for the case when @xmath29 is not too large .",
    "we will therefore only consider the @xmath31 dependence of @xmath218 induced by the term ( [ field ] ) which dominates near the primary fixed point .",
    "we now consider the consequence of ( [ field ] ) on the @xmath31 dependence of @xmath218 .",
    "application of our earlier scaling arguments and the results of ref  @xcite allow us to deduce the following crossover scaling function for @xmath218 : @xmath231 where @xmath232 is a non - universal constant , which vanishes when @xmath233 .",
    "the function @xmath234 is a completely universal scaling function which we will compute below at @xmath176 .",
    "the only non - universalities of the above result are therefore related to the coupling @xmath232 , and the value of @xmath235 which is dominated by the pauli susceptibility of the fermions .",
    "the @xmath176 computation of @xmath234 for @xmath35 can be performed as in ref  @xcite ; we find : @xmath236 \\label{chieq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath180 has to determined from ( [ meq ] ) as a function of @xmath181 and @xmath74 , and the function @xmath237 was defined in ( [ defphi ] ) .",

    "it is possible , as was the case with @xmath244 , to have a negligibly small sub - regime where @xmath245 while @xmath246 ; here we find @xmath247 .",
    "the leading contribution to the free energy density of @xmath35 is strongly divergent in the ultraviolet @xmath248 , where @xmath249 is an upper cutoff in momentum space . in the model with @xmath164",

    "@xcite that a single subtraction of the @xmath4 value of the free energy density was sufficient to make the @xmath31 dependent remainder finite .",

    ", we find here that this simple property does not hold : a single subtraction still leaves a term that is only logarithmically dependent on the upper cutoff .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising as the secondary fixed point violates hyperscaling .",

    "a discussion of the relationship of our ideas to experimental systems will follow .",
    "finally we will discuss some open theoretical issues .",
    "it is very useful to think in terms of the physics at different length and energy scales . on the whole",
    ", we may assume that the relevant energy scales decrease uniformly with increasing length scales , so the two can be used interchangeably to move between the different regimes .",
    "in what follows , we describe the sequence of crossovers as one moves from larger to smaller energy scales , or equivalently from smaller to larger length scales .    at the very largest energy scales ,",
    "the behavior is dominated by lattice scale physics , which is inherently non - universal . at slightly smaller energies , provided the doping is not too large , one can neglect the effect of mobile carriers .",
    "it was argued in ref  @xcite that spin fluctuations at these scales are _ `` quantum - critical '' _ and well described by properties of the @xmath0 critical point in the @xmath8 non - linear sigma model which separates the nel ordered and magnetically disordered phases .",
    "this proposal has been the source of some controversy in the literature , although some fairly convincing evidence has appeared in recent high temperature series studies  @xcite .",
    "the excitations in this @xmath0 quantum - critical regime are neither spin waves of the ordered state , nor @xmath262 magnons of the disordered state , but form a critical continuum .",
    "the subsequent crossovers at smaller energies depend on the doping concentration . at very low doping ,",
    "the presence of @xmath4 long - range order in the heisenberg antiferromagnet becomes apparent ; there is then a crossover from @xmath0 critical fluctuations at larger energies to the goldstone spin - wave modes of the ordered state at lower energies . at a slightly larger doping ,",
    "the @xmath4 long - range order is destroyed .",
    "the crossover at smaller energy scales is then into the quantum - disordered state of the sigma model , where the excitations are then gapped , triply degenerate , spin-1 magnons . at this same doping , and provided the geometry of the fermi surface is of type @xmath3 , there is a last crossover , at an even smaller energies , to a state where the mobile carriers induce an important @xmath4 damping of the magnon excitations  @xcite ; this damping leads to to sub - gap absorption and power - law ( in @xmath31 ) behavior of observables .",
    "all power - laws are equivalent to those of quantum disordered , @xmath2 regime , discussed below .",
    "this sequence of crossovers has been described for the case in which the damping is not too large : @xmath263 in the notation of sec  [ secscalinganalysis ] .    at even larger dopings",
    "we may have @xmath264 ; then the intermediate quantum disordered , @xmath0 , regime of a pure sigma - model is not realized , and the system undergoes crossovers from @xmath0 critical regime to @xmath2 critical regime , and then at even smaller energies to @xmath2 quantum disordered regime with relaxational behavior of spin excitations .",
    "the scaling regimes and associated crossovers are sketched in fig  [ sketch ] .",
    "we emphasize that all phase boundaries between phases on this sketch are smooth crossovers , and their precise positions are therefore not meaningful , while the sequence of crossovers and overall structure of the diagram is meaningful . in terms of this phase diagram , the shraiman - siggia model ( type @xmath1 ) ,",
    "corresponds to @xmath265  @xcite ( modulo dangerously irrelevant damping terms ) ; models with primarily relaxational behavior of spin excitations ( type @xmath3 ) , similar to that observed in @xmath23 , to @xmath266 @xcite ; and , finally , models with moderate @xmath267 exhibit spin pseudogap behavior similar to that observed in the underdoped y - based materials , such as @xmath26 and @xmath268 @xcite .",
    "the possible relationship of the phase boundaries to doping levels in the cuprate materials will be discussed in more detail in a subsequent publication .",
    "going to a finite @xmath31 introduces an additional degree of complication which substantially changes the crossovers described above .",
    "however , all of these @xmath31 dependent crossovers are contained in the universal crossover function @xmath64 in eqn ( [ cross ] ) , which was computed in a large @xmath5 expansion in this paper . the main results can be understood by keeping a simple rule of thumb in mind : the primary effect of a finite @xmath31 is to thermally quench the excitations at the energy scale @xmath65 , so that the crossovers at scales below @xmath65 no longer occur .",

    "in fact , any procedure which uses a truncated power series expansion in @xmath159 for the action appears doomed : no such expansion will correctly capture the appearance of gaps on portions of the fermi surface .",

    "hertz  @xcite did begin to address the consequences of disorder , but his analysis is seriously incomplete in all cases .",

    "@xcite where @xmath286 is the spatial dimension .",
    "it is easy to determine the source of this violation : the most important perturbation on a soft - spin version of an action like @xmath35 is a random-``mass '' term @xmath287 which accounts for fluctuations in the local value of the critical coupling at which the magnetic order is destroyed .",
    "it can be easily shown that this term is relevant about the pure fixed point as long as @xmath288 .",
    "a study of @xmath35 , with an additional random mass , along the lines of the work of boyanovsky and cardy  @xcite should be quite straightforward .",
    "however this approach involves the potentially dangerous procedure of expanding about a problem with @xmath289 time dimensions , and a method which works directly with @xmath290 would be preferable .

    "their expression for @xmath218 in terms of correlators of @xmath159 is in general agreement with our discussion in sec  [ secunisus ] .",
    "however , they focused on the temperature dependence of @xmath218 at very low @xmath31 ( @xmath291 ) near the type b fixed point ; we chose to focus on the term important near the primary type a fixed point  the latter term gives a universal ( up to an overall prefactor ) contribution to @xmath218 which should be dominant at all @xmath31 unless @xmath60 is very large .",

    "we also obtained expression for @xmath134 for arbitrary @xmath81 , but it is more cumbersome and we refrain from presenting it here . in the opposite limit , @xmath329 , or equivalently",
    "when @xmath101 vanishes , the @xmath321 dependence in ( [ a ] ) transforms into a constant term , and both pieces in ( [ chi0 ] ) contribute linear in @xmath28 terms into the imaginary part of @xmath330 .",
    "the numerical factors for each of the two pieces contain combinations of @xmath331 functions of the form , e.g. , @xmath332 .",
    "however , we have checked explicitly that the sum of the two terms does not contain @xmath333 functions .",

    "we then extend sdw calculations upto a critical point which in turn will allow us to obtain the field - dependent part of the action in a disordered phase .    to be definite , we assume that the field is directed along @xmath189 axis ( antiferromagnetic order parameter is along @xmath25 axis ) .",
    "we also introduce new operators as linear combinations of quasiparticle operators with up and down spins @xmath344 ( indices 1 and 2 correspond to up and down spin , respectively ) .",
    "the quadratic part of the hubbard hamiltonian now takes a form @xmath345 where @xmath346 .",
    "clearly , the magnetic field splits conduction and valence bands for up and down spins so we now have four different branches of fermionic excitations .",
    "however , we see that the pairs of operators @xmath347 and @xmath348 in ( [ quadr_form ] ) are decoupled from each other , and therefore the diagonalization is still a @xmath349 problem . performing the standard manipulations we obtain @xmath350 where we introduced @xmath351 and @xmath352 .",
    "the self - consistency condition now takes the form @xmath353 the computation of susceptibilities proceeds in the same way as without field , the only new feature is the appearance of a cross - polarization term @xmath354 which makes rpa ladder summation a @xmath355 matrix problem even if we neglect , as we did earlier , small terms with a momentum transfer @xmath17 .",

    "the situation is more complex .",
    "the most relevant point is that @xmath365 is still finite at the transition which implies that there is no term @xmath366 in the coupling to the field .",
