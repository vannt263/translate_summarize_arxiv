    "our knowledge of diffractive physics in deep inelastic electron - proton scattering is greatly increasing as diffractive events are being studied in more and more detail at hera @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of these events has many aspects , and several theoretical models have been proposed to describe them @xcite . despite various successes of these models we are yet far from a clear theoretical picture of what pomeron physics is in terms of qcd .",
    "detailed studies of the characteristics of the final state might help to further our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and to distinguish between various models .",
    "the measurement of two different kinds of azimuthal angles has recently been proposed : the azimuthal angle of the scattered proton @xcite or , equivalently , of the diffractive system as a whole , and the azimuthal angle of the jets in events with only two jets of large transverse momentum in the diffractive final state @xcite .",
    "the present paper will be concerned with both issues and has two purposes : to discuss some general aspects of azimuthal distributions in diffraction and to present in detail predictions for such distributions in the model of nonperturbative two - gluon exchange of landshoff and nachtmann @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : single ] we generalise the formalism of @xcite for azimuthal distributions in diffraction and show which constraints on the @xmath3 cross section for longitudinal photons their measurement can provide .",
    "a corresponding framework has long been used in various processes in non - diffractive dis @xcite . as an application we consider in sec .",
    "[ sec : jets ] the azimuthal angle of the jets in diffractive dijet production .",
    "some features of its distribution are quite characteristic for two - gluon exchange and might offer a way to test the two - gluon approximation in this type of events as was already pointed out in @xcite .",
    "we calculate the angular dependence in the landshoff - nachtmann model and show which bounds on the longitudinal cross sections could be obtained from its measurement . we also show how this method can be generalised to final states that do not necessarily have two - jet topology . in sec .",
    "[ sec : finite ] we generalise the calculation to nonzero @xmath4 and obtain the corrections this gives for the @xmath3 cross sections and for the distribution of the azimuthal jet angle . using this calculation",
    "we investigate a genuine finite-@xmath4 effect in sec .",
    "[ sec : proton ] : the correlation between the azimuthal angles of the scattered lepton and proton . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that this observable contains information about the helicity structure of the pomeron and argued that it might provide a sensitive test of various theoretical ideas about the underlying dynamics .",
    "we conclude with a summary in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "we begin by extending the formalism of @xcite to a large class of azimuthal angles in diffractive electron - proton or positron - proton collisions ,    @xmath5    where the proton remnant @xmath2 can be a proton or a diffractive excitation of a proton and where four - momenta are indicated in parentheses .",
    "we will use the conventional kinematic quantities @xmath6 for deep inelastic scattering , @xmath7 for the invariant mass of the diffractive system @xmath8 , and the variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    working in the @xmath3 rest frame one can write the azimuthal dependence of the @xmath11 cross section in a simple way by making use of the factorisation of ( [ diffreac ] ) into @xmath12 emission by the electron or positron and a diffractive photon - proton collision @xmath13 to achieve this it is essential that the selection of diffractive events , e.g.  the definition of a rapidity gap between @xmath8 and @xmath2 , is unaffected by a common rotation about the @xmath3 axis of the momenta in the hadronic final state @xmath14 , with the lepton momenta @xmath15 and @xmath16 being kept fixed .",
    "this is guaranteed if the selection criteria only involve quantities of the @xmath3 reaction , i.e.  if they do _ not _ refer to the lepton momenta @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "examples for such criteria have been given in @xcite .",
    "we define an azimuthal angle with respect to a direction in the hadronic final state @xmath14 . to this end",
    "we introduce a four - vector @xmath17 which depends only on particle momenta in the @xmath3 reaction ( [ photreac ] ) , i.e.  on @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the momenta of the final state hadrons . using a right - handed cartesian coordinate system with the @xmath20 axis in the direction of the photon momentum @xmath21 and some fixed @xmath22 and @xmath23 axes",
    "we define @xmath24 as the azimuthal angle between the lepton momentum @xmath25 and the vector @xmath26 , i.e.  as the azimuthal angle of @xmath25 minus the azimuthal angle of @xmath26",
    ".    we also use @xmath17 to introduce polarisation vectors for the virtual photon : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the transverse part of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and @xmath29 is normal to @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath17 . polarisations for positive or negative photon helicity are as usual given by @xmath30 .    the contractions of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 with the appropriate matrix element of the hadronic electromagnetic current",
    "@xmath34 give the amplitudes @xmath35 for subreaction ( [ photreac ] ) with photon helicity @xmath36 , @xmath37 the corresponding differential cross sections @xmath38 are obtained by multiplying @xmath39 with the phase space element of the hadronic final state @xmath14 and with a normalisation factor , summing over the states @xmath14 allowed by our selection criteria for the diffractive reaction and averaging over the initial proton spin .",
    "our normalisation factor corresponds to hand s convention @xcite for the photon flux . from @xmath40 with @xmath41",
    "we define in an analogous manner differential interference terms @xmath42 between photons with helicities @xmath36 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to see that the matrix @xmath42 is hermitian , @xmath44 .    with the requirement on the selection cuts formulated above the @xmath45",
    "are invariant under a common rotation of the momenta in the hadronic final state @xmath14 about the @xmath3 axis .",
    "this is because our transverse photon polarisations are not fixed but vary with the final state as they depend on @xmath17 .",
    "one can show that the cross sections @xmath38 are the same for different choices of this vector , whereas the interference terms are not . in the following sections we will put extra labels on the angle @xmath24 and the @xmath45 to distinguish different choices of @xmath17 , though for the diagonals @xmath38 this would not be necessary .    integrating over the phase space of the hadronic final state",
    "we obtain a matrix @xmath46 .",
    "we will also consider @xmath3 cross sections and interference terms that are differential in some kinematical variables of the final state , such as the momentum of the proton remnant or internal variables of the system @xmath8 .",
    "we will only use variables that can be defined as lorentz invariant functions of the four - momenta in the @xmath3 reaction .",
    "provided that the selection criteria for our reaction do not refer to any particular frame , the differential cross sections and interference terms are then lorentz invariant and as a consequence depend only on @xmath47 , @xmath48 and the variables in which they are differential .",
    "due to the rotation invariance property just mentioned they are independent of the azimuthal angle of @xmath26 in our fixed coordinate system and hence also of @xmath24 .",
    "an important property following from angular momentum conservation is that interference terms which are differential in the direction of @xmath17 vanish when @xmath17 becomes collinear with @xmath19 and @xmath18 , in which case the azimuthal angle @xmath24 is undefined @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 cross section can now be written as @xcite @xmath49 where we have integrated over a trivial overall angle , namely the azimuthal angle of the scattered lepton in the @xmath11 frame .",
    "@xmath50 is the helicity of the incoming lepton , which is approximated to be massless , @xmath51 is the usual ratio of longitudinal and transverse photon flux and @xmath52 where in the expressions of @xmath53 and @xmath54 we have neglected terms of order @xmath55 .",
    "equation ( [ xsectionmaster ] ) remains valid if its l.h.s .  and the @xmath56 on its r.h.s .",
    "are made differential in additional variables as described above . since the @xmath3",
    "cross sections and interference terms are independent of @xmath24 the dependence of the @xmath11 cross section on this angle is explicitly given by the trigonometric functions in ( [ xsectionmaster ] ) .",
    "let us have a closer look at those combinations of the @xmath46 that are multiplied with the lepton helicity @xmath50 in ( [ xsectionmaster ] ) . to make their role more apparent we introduce differential cross sections and interference terms @xmath57 with @xmath58 analogous to the @xmath42 , but with the linear photon polarisations @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 of ( [ polaris ] ) instead of @xmath62 , @xmath59 , @xmath63 in the helicity basis .",
    "we have the relations @xmath64 the terms that depend on the lepton helicity in the @xmath1 cross section are seen to be the imaginary parts of @xmath3 interference terms for linearly polarised photons .",
    "@xmath65 is given by @xmath66 multiplied with a phase space element and real factors , summed over the appropriate final states and averaged over the initial proton spin , where we define the amplitude @xmath67 for the reaction @xmath68 with photon polarisation @xmath69 in analogy to ( [ amplitude ] ) .",
    "the imaginary parts of @xmath65 , @xmath70 are obviously zero if the phase of this amplitude does not depend on the photon polarisation .",
    "note that any ( convention dependent ) phase of @xmath71 and @xmath72 drops out in @xmath73 .",
    "also there are no phases coming from @xmath74 , @xmath75 because for linearly polarised photons the polarisation vectors are purely real ; circular polarisation introduces extra phases in the @xmath3 interference terms .",
    "we emphasise that in order for @xmath76 to vanish the @xmath77 do _ not _ have to be real .",
    "the absence of final state interactions gives vanishing interference terms if one sums over a set of final states that is invariant under time reversal ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , but this is a sufficient condition , not a necessary one .",
    "here we are concerned with diffraction and the phases of our amplitudes are certainly nonzero . however , for pure pomeron exchange they are given by the signature factor and thus independent of the @xmath12 polarisation .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate whether for example the superposition of pomeron exchange with exchange of secondary trajectories or with multiple exchanges could lead to polarisation dependent phases that might be tested with longitudinally polarised lepton beams .",
    "going back to the @xmath46 for photons with definite helicity , we now make use of the parity invariance of strong interactions .",
    "it relates @xmath46 for different @xmath78 , provided that the selection criteria are parity invariant and that @xmath17 is a vector , not a pseudovector . by an argument as in @xcite one can show that under these conditions @xmath79 using this and the hermiticity of @xmath80 one obtains the relations @xmath81 so that the expression ( [ xsectionmaster ] ) of the cross section is simplified : @xmath82 for linear photon polarisations the relations corresponding to ( [ parityxsection ] ) read @xmath83 i.e.  transverse photons with polarisation perpendicular to @xmath84 of ( [ eps1 ] ) do not interfere when the final state momenta are integrated over .",
    "expressions analogous to ( [ parityxsection ] ) to ( [ linearzero ] ) are also valid for differential @xmath3 cross sections and interference terms , provided that they depend only on parity even variables , i.e.  that one sums the @xmath42 over a parity invariant set of final states .",
    "we now show how the measurement of the @xmath24-dependence in the @xmath1 cross section ( [ mastersimpler ] ) can be used to constrain the @xmath3 cross section for longitudinal photons as was pointed out in @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 is a positive semidefinite matrix , which with the simplifications from hermiticity and ( [ parityxsection ] ) from parity invariance implies @xcite @xmath85 from the measurement of the @xmath24-dependence in ( [ mastersimpler ] ) one can extract the weighted sum @xmath86 of transverse and longitudinal @xmath3 cross sections as well as the interference terms @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . for @xmath90",
    "one needs longitudinally polarised electron or positron beams . with unpolarised beams one can use the weaker constraints obtained by replacing @xmath91 with @xmath92 in ( [ eigenv ] ) and in the following .    substituting @xmath93 for @xmath94 in ( [ eigenv ] )",
    "the first condition gives @xmath95 whereas the second becomes a quadratic inequality in @xmath96 which leads to @xmath97 note that the constraints in ( [ constraint2 ] ) are the better the larger @xmath91 is compared with @xmath98 .",
    "this is what one would intuitively expect : a large interference term between longitudinal and transverse polarisations implies that neither @xmath96 nor @xmath94 can be very small , i.e.  @xmath96 can be neither very small nor very large compared with @xmath99 .",
    "for @xmath100 the bounds ( [ constraint2 ] ) are less stringent ; they then differ only by terms of relative order @xmath101 from the weaker ( but simpler ) conditions @xmath102    by taking the derivative of ( [ constraint1 ] ) to ( [ constraint3 ] ) with respect to @xmath53 one can see that all bounds are decreasing with @xmath53 if the cross sections @xmath94 , @xmath96 and interference terms @xmath87 , @xmath103 are kept fixed , so that the lower bound is better for smaller @xmath53 , i.e.  larger @xmath23 , whereas the opposite holds for the upper bounds . notice however that at fixed @xmath104 a change in @xmath105 means a change in @xmath106 and will also change the @xmath46 .",
    "if their dependence on @xmath106 is only through a common global factor then this factor drops out in the ratios between the bounds on @xmath96 and @xmath96 itself .",
    "bounds of the form ( [ constraint1 ] ) to ( [ constraint3 ] ) can also be derived for differential @xmath3 cross sections and interference terms if they satisfy parity constraints analogous to ( [ parityxsection ] ) , i.e.  if they depend only on parity invariant variables .",
    "thus one can obtain bounds on @xmath96 by evaluating inequalities analogous to ( [ constraint1 ] ) and ( [ constraint2 ] ) for differential cross sections and then integrating them .",
    "the usefulness of the bounds derived here depends of course on how large the interference terms are",
    ". they will in general be better in some parts of phase space than in others , a point we will illustrate in section [ sec : resultsj ] .",
    "an important point is that this method allows to _ constrain _ the longitudinal cross section for _ fixed _ @xmath53 , i.e.  fixed @xmath23 .",
    "as is well known , a _ measurement _ of the longitudinal cross section requires a variation of @xmath23 , which means that one must either measure the @xmath1 cross section at different c.m .",
    "energies @xmath107 , or , if @xmath104 is kept fixed , have information on how the transverse and longitudinal @xmath3 cross sections depend on @xmath106 .",
    "we finally remark that up to now we have not used the requirement of a fast outgoing proton or a rapidity gap between @xmath8 and the proton remnant @xmath2 in reaction ( [ diffreac ] ) .",
    "the analysis developed here , and in particular the possibility to constrain the longitudinal cross section , is directly applicable to ordinary deep inelastic scattering . in fact , there has been much work on azimuthal correlations in exclusive or semi - inclusive hadron production and in semi - inclusive jet production @xcite , with the vector @xmath17 defining the azimuthal angle @xmath24 taken as the momentum of the hadron or jet , resp .",
    "the @xmath24-dependence of the @xmath1 cross section is always given by ( [ xsectionmaster ] ) , ( [ mastersimpler ] ) with @xmath3 cross sections and interference terms @xmath46 appropriately defined for the the process and angle under consideration .",
    "our first example of an azimuthal angle in diffraction concerns events where the proton is scattered elastically and the diffractive final state @xmath8 consists of a quark - antiquark pair at parton level , @xmath108 which hadronises into two jets .",
    "we allow for a finite mass @xmath109 of the quark and antiquark . for the vector defining a direction in the dijet system",
    "we choose @xmath110 and work in a reference frame where the incoming @xmath18 is collinear with the @xmath12 , the photon momentum defining the @xmath20 axis , and where the total momentum of the @xmath111-pair along this axis is zero .",
    "it is related to the @xmath3 c.m .  by a boost in @xmath20 direction , so that azimuthal angles are the same in both frames .",
    "we introduce the azimuthal angle @xmath112 between the electron momentum @xmath25 and @xmath113 as in sec .",
    "[ sec : single ] , and the azimuthal angle @xmath114 between @xmath113 and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the momentum transfer from the proton",
    ". we will integrate over @xmath114 in the present section .",
    "another useful variable is the longitudinal component @xmath117 of @xmath113 , and thus of @xmath118 , along the photon direction .",
    "its range is from @xmath119 to @xmath120 with @xmath121 , and thus independent of @xmath114 .",
    "this is in contrast to the length of the transverse part @xmath122 of @xmath113 since @xmath123 only for @xmath124 do the transverse momenta of @xmath19 and @xmath125 balance ; then @xmath126 is just the squared transverse jet momentum .",
    "@xmath117 is parity invariant , which will allow us to use the simplified expression ( [ mastersimpler ] ) instead of ( [ xsectionmaster ] ) to obtain the @xmath127-dependence of the @xmath1 cross section .",
    "experimentally it is difficult to establish which of the two jets originated in the quark @xmath19 and which in the antiquark @xmath125 .",
    "it is therefore useful to sum over final states where the momenta of @xmath19 and @xmath125 are interchanged , in other words over @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "one can show that after this symmetrisation the transverse and longitudinal @xmath3 cross sections and the transverse - transverse interference terms are even in @xmath117 , whereas the transverse - longitudinal interference terms are odd in @xmath117 and vanish at @xmath130 .    to define an azimuthal angle after summing over @xmath128 and",
    "@xmath129 one can distinguish the two jets kinematically , e.g.  according to which one points in the forward direction with respect to the photon .",
    "let @xmath131 be the four - momentum of the forward and @xmath132 that of the backward jet , and choose for the direction @xmath17 instead of ( [ quarkdirection ] ) @xmath133 with the corresponding relative azimuthal angle @xmath134 between @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the longitudinal component of @xmath137 is @xmath138 .",
    "writing @xmath139 we see that @xmath140 is a polar vector so that we can again use ( [ mastersimpler ] ) for the @xmath1 cross section .",
    "in the case @xmath130 , i.e.  when the jet momenta are perpendicular to the @xmath3 axis , eq .  ( [ jetdirection ] ) leaves the sign of @xmath17 undefined , as the attribution of @xmath131 and @xmath132 to the jets is ambiguous .",
    "this leads to an ambiguity between azimuthal angles @xmath134 and @xmath141 and hence a to sign ambiguity for @xmath142 and @xmath143 but not for @xmath144 and @xmath145 . as mentioned above the transverse - longitudinal interference terms",
    "vanish at @xmath130 when summed over @xmath128 and @xmath129 , so that no ambiguity remains in the @xmath1 cross section .",
    "the summation over @xmath128 and @xmath129 is in fact trivial under the assumption that the diffractive exchange has definite charge conjugation parity , which is of course the case for pomeron or two - gluon exchange . applying charge conjugation invariance of the strong interactions to the photon dissociation part of the @xmath3 subreaction",
    "it then follows that the differential cross section for ( [ diffjets ] ) remains the same if we exchange @xmath19 and @xmath146 : @xmath147 to sum over @xmath128 and @xmath129 and change from the variable @xmath128 to @xmath140 we thus only need to multiply the cross section with 2 and replace @xmath112 with @xmath134 and @xmath117 with @xmath138 .      in this subsection",
    "we give the differential cross section for reaction ( [ diffjets ] ) at @xmath124 in the model of landshoff and nachtmann ( ln ) @xcite .",
    "the transverse and longitudinal @xmath3 cross sections have been computed in @xcite , and the calculation of the interference terms goes along the same lines .",
    "we therefore only recall the essentials of the model and give the final results .",
    "the ln model was developed to give a simple qcd based description of the soft pomeron .",
    "it approximates pomeron exchange by the exchange of two gluons which are taken as nonperturbative , i.e.  they have a nonperturbative propagator @xmath148 instead of @xmath149 in feynman gauge .",
    "the nonperturbative propagator @xmath150 is a difficult quantity to compute and indeed there is no consensus in the literature about its behaviour at small @xmath151 @xcite , but we will not attempt to discuss this issue here",
    ". we will instead follow the rather model independent approach of @xcite , which is based on the observation that often the amplitude of a considered process can be approximated in such a way that it depends on @xmath150 only via certain simple integrals , so that it is not necessary to know the detailed functional form of @xmath150 . in the present paper",

    "the integral ( [ moment1 ] ) does not appear because both @xmath179 and @xmath180 vanish at @xmath177 . in this approximation ( [ imn ] ) becomes @xmath181    as a benchmark we have compared the integrals @xmath182 in the approximation ( [ loopapprox ] ) with their exact values for the model gluon propagator used in @xcite : @xmath183^{-n } { \\hspace{6pt},}\\hspace{4em } n \\ge 4 { \\hspace{6pt},}\\label{specialgluon}\\ ] ] where the proportionality constant can easily be obtained from ( [ moment1 ] ) . for @xmath184 this becomes @xmath185 .",

    "let us make some remarks on the results ( [ imn ] ) , ( [ imn2 ] ) . the first concerns the sign of the @xmath3 interference terms .",
    "the transverse - transverse interference is always positive , so that the term with @xmath199 in the @xmath1 cross section ( [ sigmajetselectron ] ) is negative .",
    "in @xcite it was pointed out that this is the opposite sign than the one obtained for @xmath111-production in photon - gluon fusion .",
    "the sign of the longitudinal - transverse interference depends on the loop integral @xmath200 and thus on the value of @xmath171 .",
    "( [ imn2 ] ) gives a sign change at @xmath201 , the exact value of @xmath171 from ( [ imn ] ) is larger and depends on @xmath126 as mentioned at the end of the previous subsection .",
    "this characteristic change of sign has also been observed in @xcite . as a general remark we can say that the distribution of the @xmath11 cross section in @xmath112 we obtain is very similar to the one in the perturbative two - gluon approach of @xcite , apart from the overall normalisation which comes out different in the two models , cf .",
    "the main characteristics of the normalised azimuthal distribution are determined by the two - gluon exchange picture .",
    "we now turn to the dependence on the transverse jet momentum . from ( [ imn ] )",
    "one sees that compared with the transverse cross section the transverse - longitudinal interference is suppressed by a factor @xmath202 , the transverse - transverse interference by @xmath203 and the longitudinal cross section by @xmath204 .",

    "for the complete amplitude they are contracted with the propagators of the gluons , and the result is contracted with a tensor corresponding to the gluons coupling to the produced quark and antiquark .",
    "we wish to remark that one need not take a feynman - like gauge for the gluons , i.e.  a propagator @xmath253 where @xmath15 is the gluon momentum .",

    "the approximation of two noninteracting gluons in the ln model is certainly a very crude one . to go beyond it one could replace the direct coupling of the gluons to a quark in the proton by the cut amplitude for the emission by the proton of two gluons , in other words by the cut amplitude for @xmath257 . including the gluon propagators the latter might be approximated by the gluon distribution in the proton @xcite at zero @xmath4 .",
    "this is however not useful when we want to compute the effects of finite @xmath4 , since in the gluon distribution the four - momenta of the two gluons are by definition equal , in particular they do not transfer any transverse momentum @xmath243 .",

    "we first have to replace the general diffractive final state @xmath8 with a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "this is the lowest order approximation of @xmath8 at parton level and should give a reasonable description , except in the region of small @xmath194 , or large diffractive mass @xmath7 , where additional gluon emission is known to be important .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath3 cross sections and interference terms for the process ( [ diffjets ] ) is essentially the same as the one in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : upper ] to be valid .",
    "unless we have a large mass @xmath109 for the produced quarks , this means that we must impose a lower cut on their transverse momentum .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the @xmath3 cross sections and interferences have a physical interpretation in terms of the helicity of the pomeron if one works in the rest frame of the diffractive system @xmath8 , provided that the selection cuts on the hadronic final state are invariant when the particle momenta in the system @xmath8 are rotated around the photon momentum in this frame while all other momenta are kept fixed .",
    "nonzero interference terms between photons with definite helicities in this frame imply that different amounts of angular momentum along the photon direction are transferred from the proton . in pomeron language",
    "this means that the pomeron can carry different helicities .    to satisfy the above criterion of rotation invariance we impose a cut on the transverse quark momentum in the @xmath8 rest frame and not in the @xmath3 system",
    "to do this we have to transform the kinematical quantities introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : jetkin ] to the c.m .  of @xmath8 .",

    "the relation between the longitudinal and transverse components of @xmath128 in both frames is as follows : latexmath:[\\ ] ] here we have used the integrals @xmath329 , @xmath393 introduced in ( [ basiccombinations ] ) , and the abbreviations @xmath394    a remark is in order on the appearance of the square root @xmath306 in the expression of the transverse - longitudinal interference terms .",
    "one might suspect that there is a contradiction with the analyticity properties of scattering amplitudes , but this is not so .",
    "the point is that this interference term is multiplied with @xmath395 in the @xmath1 cross section , and that the expression of @xmath395 in terms of mandelstam invariants also involves square roots , so that the appearance of @xmath306 is a consequence of the kinematical variables we choose .",
    "put in a different way , the interference terms can have a dependence on @xmath396 through the polarisation vectors ( [ polaris ] ) , which contain square roots .",
    "a corresponding remark can be made for the appearance of @xmath117 in the transverse - longitudinal interference term corresponding to the jet angle in ( [ imn ] ) , ( [ imn3 ] ) .    as discussed in sections",

    "apart from this caveat the result ( [ lnratios ] ) is however independent of the detailed properties of the gluon propagator .",
    "the scale @xmath155 comes into play in this model via the nonperturbative dynamics of the exchanged gluons . since it only appears squared in the calculation , cf .",
    "( [ integralsexpand ] ) , it is clear that it can not be the scale dividing @xmath306 in @xmath374 ; there we have the large kinematical variable @xmath371 as in ( [ dlratios ] ) .",

    "we will not find ratios @xmath373 of order one as suggested by ( [ lnratios ] ) in our numerical examples .",
    "the reason is that @xmath402 ( but not @xmath403 ) has an additional suppression compared with the cross section term @xmath404 by a factor of @xmath405 , which can be rather small for the @xmath406 where we cut in the case of light quarks , and even goes down to zero for charm production .",
    "after integration over @xmath407 the first relation of ( [ lnratios ] ) is more precisely @xmath408 for light quarks with a momentum cutoff and @xmath409 for heavy quarks and integration down to @xmath410 . in ( [ ratioimprovedcharm ] )",
    "@xmath193 appears since it is the typical scale of @xmath407 in the integration if the quark mass is large .",
    "the question arises what one can expect for @xmath373 when there is no lower cut on @xmath407 in the case of light quarks .",
    "after all the main contribution to @xmath411 summed over all flavours and the full phase space is from light quarks at low transverse momenta . because of the approximations of our calculation we can not extrapolate ( [ imnx ] ) to this region , but we want to give an educated guess . we have argued in @xcite that with some caveats the ln model can still be applied to @xmath158 in the limit @xmath412 . in the results ( [ imn ] ) from our investigation of the jet angle dependence at @xmath124 we observe that the suppression of @xmath413 with respect to @xmath414 is by a factor @xmath220 even in this limit . taking this as a guidance for the interference term in our present problem we expect that a suppression by @xmath406 of the differential interference term may persist for very small @xmath415 , so that @xmath416 in ( [ ratioimprovedcut ] ) is to be replaced with some average @xmath407 if we integrate over the full phase space . examining the loop integrals @xmath417 of ( [ loopintegrals ] )",

    "the scale @xmath155 has cancelled and we find the same behaviour for both @xmath373 and @xmath374 as in the donnachie landshoff model ( [ dlratios ] ) .",
    "let us however remark that there one has @xmath421 even with a large cutoff on @xmath407 , in contrast to ( [ lnratios ] ) , ( [ ratioimprovedcut ] ) , so that the predictions of the two models are by no means identical .    coming back to what we were able to calculate in the ln model we now give some numerical illustrations of our results . in analogy to sec .  [ sec : resultsf ] we integrate over @xmath382 and plot the fourier coefficients @xmath422 , @xmath423 , @xmath424 with a global factor @xmath425 taken out .",

    "we either sum over the three light flavours @xmath428 for the produced quarks , with a minimum @xmath407 so that our calculation is valid , or we consider produced charm quarks for which we can integrate over the full kinematical range of @xmath382 .",
    "the @xmath4-dependence of the fourier coefficients for the model propagator ( [ specialgluon ] ) with @xmath429 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourierprot ] for different values of the free kinematical parameters .",
    "we observe that the transverse - transverse interference is usually larger than the transverse - longitudinal one .",
    "[ fig : angleprot ] shows an example of the @xmath363-dependence of the @xmath1 cross section at two different values of @xmath4 . in case",
    "@xmath216 the distribution is clearly not flat , although the effect is not very large , whereas in case @xmath215 almost no @xmath363-dependence can be seen .",
    "this illustrates how the transverse - transverse interference is affected by the parameter @xmath430 , which is @xmath431 in case @xmath215 and @xmath219 in case @xmath216 .    to assess the model dependence of our prediction we also evaluated the fourier coefficients taking the simple ansatz ( [ simpleexpand ] ) for the integrals over the gluon propagators , with different values for the coefficient @xmath349 .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourierprotmodel ] for the case of light quarks , the effects for charm are similar . as in sec .",
    "[ sec : resultsf ] the results , especially at large @xmath297 , change considerably with @xmath349 . in particular the sign of the transverse - transverse interference term is different for @xmath349 below or above @xmath400 , and for @xmath432 this term is very small , as discussed above .",
    "we repeat that one would have to see whether realistic gluon propagators give values of @xmath349 as far away from zero as the ones taken in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourierprotmodel ] .",
    "we find that the leading order expressions of @xmath404 , @xmath433 and @xmath399 in ( [ imnx ] ) give a rather good approximation of what is obtained by including terms of @xmath420 , except of course for @xmath399 if @xmath432 . as in sec .",
    "[ sec : resultsf ] this means that the main effect comes from terms depending on @xmath330 , whereas corrections in @xmath327 are relatively small .",
    "terms in @xmath330 are also essential to describe the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath403 . although its order of magnitude at small @xmath4 is given by @xmath434 , a mere square root dependence on @xmath297 for the fourier coefficient @xmath424 in figures [ fig : fourierprot ] and [ fig : fourierprotmodel ] is clearly not a good approximation unless @xmath4 is very small .    to conclude this section we remark on the possibility to constrain the cross section for longitudinal photons from the measurement of the @xmath363-dependence using the method described in sec .",
    "[ sec : bounds ] . with the results we obtain in the ln model the bounds on @xmath435 would not be stringent at all , and be far away from its actual value .",
    "this is because we find the interference @xmath436 , whose size is crucial to obtain good constraints , to be of order @xmath437 . from ( [ constraint3 ] )",
    "we can see that the lower bound on @xmath438 then vanishes like @xmath439 for small @xmath4 , whereas @xmath435 itself does not become small in this limit .",
    "this is different from the situation we found for the jet angle in sec .",
    "[ sec : resultsj ] .",
    "one would expect better bounds if the ratio of the longitudinal - transverse interference and the @xmath3 cross sections at small @xmath4 were dominated by a hadronic scale instead of @xmath371 or @xmath7 .",
    "this might happen in other models of diffraction where soft dynamics is important .",
    "in this paper we investigated correlations between azimuthal angles in deep inelastic @xmath1 diffraction , using the one - photon approximation .",
    "we first derived the general expression for the dependence of the @xmath1 cross section on a suitably defined azimuthal angle between the lepton plane and a direction in the hadronic final state in terms of cross sections and interference terms of the @xmath3 collision for different photon helicities .",
    "this was a direct generalisation of the work in @xcite .",
    "we showed that those terms in the cross section that depend on the helicity of the lepton beam are sensitive to a polarisation dependence of the phases in the @xmath3 amplitudes for linearly polarised photons . from the angular dependence of the @xmath1",
    "cross section one can obtain bounds on the differential or integrated cross section for longitudinal photons , without having to vary @xmath23 as it is needed for its direct measurement .",
    "how stringent these bounds are depends on the size of the interference term between longitudinal and transverse polarisations and thus on the choice of azimuthal angle and on the region of phase space considered .",
    "we have investigated the dependence on the azimuthal jet angle predicted by the ln model for the parton level reaction @xmath440 at large transverse momentum of the @xmath111-pair , which at hadron level describes a pair of jets that carries the entire four - momentum of the diffractive final state .",
    "the size of the interference terms is found to be controlled by the quantity @xmath203 .",
    "the sign of the transverse - longitudinal interference depends on @xmath194 .",
    "since this interference is less strongly suppressed than the longitudinal cross section , it may offer an opportunity to observe the zero of the longitudinal amplitude at certain values of @xmath126 and @xmath194 which is characteristic of the two - gluon exchange mechanism .",
    "the bounds on the longitudinal cross section obtained from the azimuthal dependence might be quite useful , at small @xmath441 at least the lower bound comes out quite close to its actual value which is also small in this kinematical region .",
    "we suggest that the use of an azimuthal angle defined from an event shape variable like the thrust axis in the diffractive final state would allow to extend this method to a wider class of final states , in particular it would allow to go to smaller values of @xmath126 than those needed for jet algorithms and thus to increase the total rate in the analysis .",
    "the cross section for @xmath442 was then calculated at finite @xmath4 with the approximations @xmath443 and @xmath444 , for the definition of @xmath175 cf .",
    "( [ bartelsscale ] ) , ( [ scalegeneral ] ) .",
    "its region of validity is therefore the production of jets or heavy flavours where @xmath175 is sufficiently large .",
    "the result then involves three @xmath4-dependent integrals ( [ basicintegrals ] ) with two gluon propagators at different virtualities .",
    "the relevant scale for the @xmath4-behaviour of these integrals is @xmath445 .",
    "the limit @xmath333 for two of them is known from phenomenology , for the rest one has to resort to specific model propagators .    applying this calculation to the dependence on the azimuthal jet angle we find that apart from the dominating effect of the proton form factor @xmath446 and the pomeron trajectory @xmath447 the @xmath4-dependence of the @xmath3 cross sections and interference terms is controlled by corrections in @xmath330 coming from the gluon propagators , corrections in @xmath4 divided by a large kinematical scale of the transition @xmath260 are much smaller . as a consequence",
    "the quantitative features of the results depend on the choice of gluon propagator . using the model propagator ( [ specialgluon ] )",
    "we typically find that the sum of the transverse and longitudinal cross sections decreases by a factor around 2 between @xmath311 and @xmath448 when the strong suppression from @xmath446 and the pomeron trajectory is taken out .",
    "the absolute size of the interference terms tends to decrease with @xmath297 and one can even have a change of their signs .",
    "another important azimuthal angle is that of the scattered proton or proton remnant .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that its measurement can give information on the helicity structure of the pomeron .",
    "we have investigated its distribution in the ln model , but due to our approximations had to restrict ourselves to a @xmath111 final state with large transverse quark momentum @xmath384 in the @xmath111 rest frame , or with a large quark mass .",
    "like for the jet angle we find that the @xmath4-dependence of the cross sections and interference terms is controlled by the scale @xmath155 , and that the results depend rather strongly on the integrals over the gluon propagators .",
    "the order of magnitude of the transverse - longitudinal interference is given by @xmath434 .",
    "the ratio between the interference of the two transverse polarisations and the transverse cross section goes like @xmath449 which can be large , but it is suppressed by an additional factor @xmath406 so that this interference is small at low @xmath407 .",
    "unfortunately we can not take the limit @xmath450 for light quarks in our calculation but",
    "our guess is that the @xmath451-integrated transverse - transverse interference will be suppressed by @xmath327 compared with the transverse cross section , which would lead to a rather flat angular dependence in the @xmath1 spectrum . according to the discussion in @xcite the helicity of the ln pomeron",
    "is then dominated by one value in the inclusive diffractive process , whereas several helicities are important when there is a high transverse momentum or mass scale in the diffractive final state .",
    "notice that a system of two gluons we use to model the pomeron can in principle transfer any integer value of angular momentum through its orbital motion .",
    "our finding that finite-@xmath4 effects are rather sensitive to the nonperturbative gluon dynamics in the ln model suggests that they may come out quite different in other models of diffraction and could thus be a useful probe of the mechanisms at work in diffractive physics .",
