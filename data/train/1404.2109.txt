    "because of the recent experimental development such as the single molecule manipulation , nonequilibrium statistical mechanics for small systems is a topic of wide interest  @xcite .",

    "one of the important approaches to athermal statistical mechanics is based on non - gaussian stochastic models  @xcite , as the crucial property of athermal fluctuation is its non - gaussianity  @xcite . on the basis of this approach ,",
    "several interesting phenomena have been reported in athermal systems , which are quite different from thermal ones  @xcite .",
    "for example , unidirectional transport induced by asymmetric properties of noises or potentials has been discussed with non - gaussian stochastic models  @xcite .",
    "however , there have been so far few studies addressing energy pumping processes of athermal systems . as energy pumping plays crucial roles in thermal physics ( i.e. , the carnot cycles  @xcite )",
    ", we expect that energy pumping will play important roles in understanding athermal fluctuations .    in this paper",
    ", we study the geometrical pumping  @xcite for athermal systems .",
    "when a mesoscopic system is slowly and periodically modulated by several control parameters , there can exist a net average current even without dc bias .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the geometrical pumping or the adiabatic pumping , and has been observed in various systems  @xcite .",
    "the geometrical pumping originates from the effect of the berry - sinitsyn - nemenman phase  @xcite , where a cyclic manipulation in the parameter space induces a nonzero current that is associated with a geometrical quantity on the parameter space .",
    "however , all previous studies for open systems address systems connected with thermal or equilibrium reservoirs . since we encounter athermal systems in various systems , it would be important to study the geometrical pumping coupled with athermal environments .    here , we study a realistic geometrical pumping model in an electrical circuit coupled with athermal noise ( i.e. , avalanche noise ) .",
    "we consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor , resistances , voltages , and avalanche diodes . in the condition with strong reverse voltages ,",
    "the avalanche diodes produce intermittent fluctuation whose statistics is non - gaussian  @xcite .",
    "we model this system by a non - gaussian langevin equation , and find that we can extract a positive amount of work ( energy ) and power ( work per unit time ) from the athermal fluctuation as a result of the geometrical effect , while the system is spatially symmetric .",

    "continuous manipulation of the quadratic part of the potential is experimentally realized by changing the width between the plates @xmath12 , where @xmath12 corresponds to the external parameter as @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "nonquadratic potentials can also be realized by inserting a medium with nonlinear permittivity , where we manipulate its nonquadratic part by changing the depth of insertion ( see appendix  [ app : manipulation ] for the details ) .",
    "we next discuss the avalanche noise . for sufficiently strong reverse voltages ,",
    "minority carriers in diodes are accelerated enough to create ionization , producing more carriers which in turn create more ionization .",
    "thus , electrical current is multiplied to become an intermittent noise .",
    "this noise is known as the avalanche noise , which can be approximated as a white non - gaussian noise in the case of a high level of avalanche  @xcite .",
