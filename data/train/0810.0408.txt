    "the abundance and distribution of heavy elements ( metals ) in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) holds information about the history of galaxy clusters ( clusters from now on ) .",
    "metals formed as a result of star formation in the cluster galaxies must be transported into the icm and a variety of mechanisms are possible , for example galactic - scale winds , or outflows driven by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "x - ray spectroscopic observations provide a direct prove of metallicity gradients in the icm .",
    "many clusters show an approximately flat metallicity distribution , of about a third of the solar ( @xmath0 ) , out to megaparsec distances from the cluster core @xcite .",
    "moreover , the metallicity profiles of cool core intermediate redshift ( ) clusters , particularly those that show no evidence of shocks associated with mergers , have an abundance excess of the order at their cores @xcite .",
    "high resolution chandra x - ray observations of the core of hydra  a , show that metals in the central regions were formed by different stellar populations @xcite , with a metal replenishment time of the order of over a period of 1gyr .",
    "similar results are found for other clusters as well @xcite .    over recent years",
    "there has been a growing consensus that radio galaxies have a significant impact on the cluster environment ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "jets from radio - loud agn provide an ideal mechanism for coupling the energy output from the agn to the surrounding gas , both via heating by the bow shock ( @xcite ; reynolds , heinz & begelman 2001 ; @xcite ) , but also by driving gas from the core during both the active phase of the jet ( e.g. , alexander 2002 ) , but also as the buoyant remnant ",
    "bubbles  of the radio - source cocoons rise though the cluster gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the effects can be very long lasting as a large - scale convective flow can be established by the rising bubbles @xcite .",
    "these flows have important effects on the entropy and energy of the central icm ( see e.g. , @xcite and references there in ) , and can transport metals from the core to radii of order a megaparsec within the cluster ( @xcite ; heath , krause & alexander 2007 ) .",
    "moreover , the bubbles are inferred to produce hydrodynamic turbulence in the icm @xcite .",
    "these processes may well be linked to the cluster - wide feedback with infall of cooling gas triggering the agn activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed lack of evolution of the icm metallicity out to redshift of order  1 @xcite , suggests that metal advection took place at or before a redshift of unity .",
    "furthermore , the metallicity gradients in the icm also suggest that the metals were expelled from the dominant central cluster galaxy rather than from ram - pressure stripping of cluster galaxies in general @xcite .",
    "supernovae do not provide sufficient energy for that process and an attractive alternative are powerful radio galaxies @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the advection of metals driven by radio - loud agn .",
    "we investigate numerically the effects that the powerful jets and continuous metal formation , of a massive galaxy in the core of a cool core cluster , have on the hydrodynamics and chemistry of the icm .",
    "we explore the consequences of varying the jet power , the galaxy metal distribution profile and the metal formation rates .",
    "our implemented cluster and galaxy models are described in section  2 along with our numerical setup .",
    "we describe and discuss our results in section  3 and give our conclusions in section  4 . in this paper",
    "we extend the work of @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use an improved numerical scheme ( see below ) which enables us to model intermittent jets as well as injection of metals from star formation .",
    "we solve the equations of hydrodynamics using the flash code @xcite assuming axisymmetry in a 2d sphere .",
    "given this geometry we use spherical polar coordinates ( r,@xmath1 ) .",
    "flash is a well tested @xcite parallel modular hydrodynamics code with an adaptive mesh .",
    "it solves the riemann problem using a piecewise - parabolic method able to work well with contact discontinuities , making it well - suited to our current problem .    to implement the galaxy cluster we use a computational domain with ranges , with outflow and hydrostatic boundary conditions at the inner and outer radii respectively , and both with reflective boundary conditions to establish the rotational symmetry of the system .",
    "our initial grid setup consisted of which were adaptively refined by a half , attaining a maximum resolution of 2.92kpc in the radial direction and 1.27kpc in the angular one .",
    "each simulation took 5 hours ( on average ) to run on 20 processors of the camgrid cluster of the university of cambridge , and the production runs were made at the darwin cluster of the university .",
    "the initial conditions of our icm gas were simulated as a monoatomic hydrogen plasma with an ideal gas equation of state ( @xmath2 ) , an initial constant temperature of and a king density profile @xcite :    @xmath3    we set the cluster s core density , @xmath4 , and radius , @xmath5 , to be and 100kpc respectively , and take . for this initial gas distribution to be in hydrostatic equilibrium , the gravitational acceleration of the dark matter potential",
    "well must satisfy :    @xmath6    where @xmath7@xmath81@xmath92 and @xmath10 is the proton mass .",
    "we neglect the self - gravity of the cluster gas and take this as a fixed background gravitational field .",
    "we include an energy loss term , @xmath11 , to account for the icm radiative cooling due to bremsstrahlung :    @xmath12    our simulations consist of three phases : ( 1 ) the cooling flow phase , in which we let the initial icm to evolve subject to bremsstrahlung radiation and gravity only , until it reaches a quasi - steady state .",
    "the system then develops a nearly spherically symmetric inflow .",
    "( 2 ) the radio galaxy active phase(s ) , when we use the region of the inner radial boundary ( with ) to inject two light jets into the cluster with a velocity of a third of the speed of light ( lorentz ) .",
    "we set the density of the jets to be  10@xmath13 times smaller than the initial central icm density , and the pressure of the jets was adjusted to that of the cooled central icm of .",
    "this simulates a powerful fr  ii @xcite radio source with a jet power of .",
    "( 3 ) the remnant phase , during which the icm , the metals ( see the following section ) and the convective flows left by the jets evolve passively , under the influence of gravity and bremsstrahlung radiation , for 3gyr .",
    "our different simulations and parameters are summarised in table  1 .",

    "we present 2d axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations of the metal advection in the icm , driven by the jets of a radio - loud agn .",
    "we implement the icm with a cooling flow , and the central cd  galaxy with a metal distribution and continuous metal formation , and powerful intermittent jets .",
    "the jets produce the early and late features typical of canonical models , simulations and observations of fr  ii objects ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "we model the metals using tracer fields and explore the consequences of varying the jet intermittency , the galaxy metal distribution profile and the metal formation rates .",
    "we have found the following .",
    "although powerful agn jets are transitory phenomena they produce important dynamical and chemical effects on the icm on megaparsec  scales for a few gigayears .",
    "the convective flows formed long after the agn active phases drag @xmath1495% of the initial metals in the central galaxy to distances .",
    "we implement intermittent jets with the same total energy input to the icm .",

    "metallicity drops are formed ( found by @xcite as well ) of factors at .",
    "these features might be correlated to the mass of the gas and metal advected by the relic bubbles , but high resolution x - ray observations are needed to see traces of such metallicity gradients .",
    "furthermore , intermittent jets distribute metals @xmath14300kpc further than single outburst jets do , and also facilitate the mixing of gases with different metal concentrations and induce turbulence in the icm .",
    "the metal injection has effects on the general metal abundances present in the icm : the faster the metal replenishment time the higher the metal abundance . for our simulations",
    "are dominated by the metals of the central galaxy and do not follow the general trends present at larger radii on either our simulations or the x - ray observations . since metal production and jets are realistic in active galaxies , metalliciy gradients in the very central regions of cool core clusters are likely to be shaped by less - energetic phenomena . on the other hand ,",
    "away from the core , some of our simulations ( specially the one with a single jet outburst and no metal injection ) develop metallicity gradients in agreement with , over particular radial ranges , the observations of @xcite and references there in .",
