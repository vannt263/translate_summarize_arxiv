    "in cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology , galaxies form hierarchically and present - day galaxies are the products of successive mergers @xcite .",
    "recent observations show that almost all galaxies harbor supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at their centers @xcite and the black hole ( bh ) masses tightly correlate with the properties of their host galaxies such as the mass of stellar bulge @xcite , the bulge luminosity @xcite , and the nuclear stellar velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the correlations between bh mass and galaxy properties imply that the growth of smbhs and the formation and evolution of galaxies are closely linked .",
    "the correlation is likely induced by galaxy major mergers ( merging of galaxies with comparable mass ) in which both rapid star formation and gas accretion onto smbhs are triggered and the feedback from the central active galactic nuclei ( agns ) regulates the growth of both smbhs and galaxy bulges .",
    "the coevolution scenario can successfully explain not only the correlations between smbhs and their host galaxies but also many of the observed evolutions of galaxies and agns @xcite .",
    "during galaxy mergers part of the gas originally in galactic plane is driven to galaxy center , triggering starburst and the accretion of central smbh @xcite . if both galaxies in the merging system harbor smbhs at their centers , a pair of agns could form which is an intriguing object for both observations and theories .",
    "because of dynamical friction the two smbhs quickly sink to the common center of the two merging galaxies , forming a bound , compact ( @xmath2 pc ) supermassive black hole binary ( smbhb , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would be difficult to resolve in any but the closest galaxies using current telescopes . as the separation of the binary shrinks , dynamical friction becomes less and less efficient and",
    "three - body interaction between smbhb and the stars passing by becomes more and more important . at separations",
    "@xmath3 pc smbhb becomes hard in the sense that the binary loses energy and angular momentum mainly through three - body interaction .",
    "the stars passing by the binary , if not tidally disrupted or swallowed by the bhs , would be expelled by the `` slingshot effect '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* q96 thereafter ) with velocities comparable to the host galaxy s escape velocity .",
    "if the refilling of the reservoir of stars on orbits that interact with the smbhb is inefficient , the evolution of smbhb slows down and the evolution timescale may even exceed the hubble time , with the smbhb separation stalling well outside the radii needed for the final gravitational wave radiation and coalescence stage ( * ? ? ?",
    "* y02 hereafter ) .",
    "this seems inconsistent with that fact that smbhbs have not yet been observed in nearby galaxies .",
    "therefore , many stellar - dynamical mechanisms are proposed to boost the hardening rate of smbhbs in gas - poor systems , including non - equilibrium stellar distribution @xcite , brownian motion of smbhb @xcite , and non - spherical ( axisymmetric , triaxial , or irregular ) stellar distribution ( y02 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the conclusions in the above scenarios depend on processes which are not well understood , so it is still unclear whether smbhbs could coalesce within a hubble time using purely stellar - dynamical processes . in gas - rich systems it has been argued that the interaction between binary bhs and the gaseous environment could efficiently drive the binary to the gravitational radiation dominant domain within a timescale of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "although many physical processes have been proposed in the literature to boost the hardening rates of smbhbs , the abundance of binary bhs in galaxy centers has not yet been strongly constrained observationally .",
    "because of their compactness , bound smbhbs are very difficult to resolve directly with current telescopes , and only unbound smbhbs in a couple of gas - rich ( wet ) galaxy mergers have been identified @xcite .",
    "so far all the evidence for bound and hard smbhbs are indirect and model dependent .",
    "the prototype evidence for smbhbs in agns is the helical morphology of radio jets in many radio galaxies which may be due to the precession of jet orientation in a smbhb system @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the periodic outbursts observed in some agns @xcite are due to the orbital motion of the jet - emitting bh in smbhb @xcite , the precession of spin axis of the rotating primary bh @xcite , the interaction between smbhb and a standard accretion disk @xcite or an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) @xcite .",
    "x - shaped features in a subclass of radio galaxies have been attributed to the interaction and alignment of smbhbs and standard accretion disks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* alternatives see @xcite ) .",
    "there is also some evidence for the coalescence of smbhbs in agns .",
    "@xcite suggested that the double - double radio galaxies and the restarting jet formation in some radio galaxies are due to the removal and refilling of inner accretion disk because of the interaction with smbhbs .",
    "although there is much circumstantial evidence for both active and coalesced smbhbs in agns , it is still unclear what fraction of smbhbs would coalesce during or before the agn phase and how many could survive to the later dormant or inactive phase . because present observations can not give constraints on the physical processes which have been proposed to boost the hardening rates of smbhbs , @xcite suggested measuring the acceleration of jet precession as a way of determing the hardening rates of smbhbs in agns and to place strong constraints on models of smbhb evolution .",
    "in inactive galaxies or gas - poor mergers the observational evidence for smbhbs is very rare .",
    "one possible way to identify uncoalesced smbhbs in inactive galaxies is to detect hypervelocity binary stars ejected by smbhbs with the three - body sling - shot effect @xcite .",
    "however , this method can not be applied to distant galaxies .",
    "therefore , in this paper we suggest a way to determine statistically whether smbhbs in nearby galaxies have coalesced .",
    "one inevitable impact of a non - rorating smbh on its stellar environment is that stars passing by the bh as close as the tidal radius @xmath5 would be tidally disrupted @xcite , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the radius and mass of the stars and @xmath8 is the bh mass .",
    "part of the stellar debris will be spewed to highly eccentric bound orbits and later fall back onto the bh , giving rise to an outburst decaying within months to years @xcite .",
    "these tidal flares are definitive evidences of smbhs in inactive galaxies @xcite . since the frequency of stellar disruption depends on the surrounding stellar distribution (",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* thereafter mt99 ) , the stellar disruption rate can be used as a probe of the inner structure of galactic nucleus .",
    "for nearby early - type galaxies recent theoretical calculation with single bh without taking into account general relativistic ( gr ) effects gives an averaged stellar disruption rate of @xmath9 per galaxy if the stellar distribution is spherically symmetric @xcite or possibly @xmath10 orders of magnitude higher if the stellar distribution is non - spherical ( axisymmetric or triaxial , * ? ? ?",
    "however , if smbhbs reside in galactic centers the stellar distribution would be dramatically changed due to the slingshot effect , and the stellar disruption rate would be very different .",
    "@xcite studied the interaction between smbhb and dense galactic cusp ( @xmath11 pc ) for a bound , but non - hard , binary at the dynamical friction stage and found a high disruption rate of @xmath12 . @xcite",
    "considered the stellar disruption by single bhs immediately after smbhb coalescence .",
    "they found that the tidal disruption rate is significantly suppressed due to the low density core forming during the hard stage of smbhbs .",
    "since the two stages investigated by @xcite and @xcite are two short phases in the evolution of smbhbs and binary bhs with mass ratios @xmath13 spend most of their lifetime on the hard stage ( y02 ) , it would be very interesting to calculate the tidal disruption rate of stellar objects for hard smbhbs .",
    "therefore , in this paper we calculate tidal disruption rates for hard and stalling smbhbs .",
    "we suggest that the comparison of expected tidal disruption rate by single smbhs or hard smbhbs and the future survey of x - ray or uv flares at nearby galactic centers could tell us whether most of the smbhs in nearby galaxies are single or binary and whether the smbhbs would coalesce rapidly , as expected by some models .",
    "the stellar disruption rate in a galaxy harboring a smbhb depends on : ( 1 ) the rate that stars are fed from large - scale to the vicinity of smbhb and ( 2 ) the probability that a star moving in the vicinity of the smbhb passes close enough to one of the bhs to be tidally disrupted .",
    "although there has been much work on the former part , intended to study the evolution timescale of smbhb ( q96 ; y02 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the latter is largely unaddressed in the literature .",
    "because of the chaotic nature of three - body interaction , numerical scattering experiments are needed to give the probability of tidal disruption .",
    "previous numerical experiments on star - smbhb interactions mainly focus on energy and angular momentum exchanges ( q96 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the limited particle numbers are insufficient to tackle the rare events of very close encounters such as tidal disruptions .",
    "therefore , we begin with intensive numerical scattering experiments ( normally @xmath1 particles in each run ) to calculate the tidal disruption cross sections for hard smbhbs . then we apply our results to a sample of nearby galaxies and estimate the tidal disruption rates of stellar objects both by single and binary bhs in different types of galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   [ bg ]",
    "we briefly review some basic properties of hard smbhbs and show how to calculate stellar disruption rate .",
    "we describe our numerical scattering experiments in   [ experi ] and present the results in   [ results ] . in   [ apply ] we calculate stelar disruption rates with realistic galaxy models and discuss the differences between the tidal disruption rates for single and binary bhs .",
    "we also estimate the density of tidal disruption events in local universe and make predictions for future surveys of uv / x - ray flares in   [ prediction ] . in   [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss the observational signatures of smbhbs in inactive galaxies and the implications for the evolution of binary bhs .",

    "observations of nearby galaxies show that bh mass tightly correlates with bulge velocity dispersion @xcite . if the total bh mass @xmath23 of smbhb also follows the empirical @xmath24 relation : @xmath25 @xcite , equation  ( [ ah ] ) reduces to @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the mass ratio of the binary . in this paper",
    "we only consider @xmath29 because the dynamical friction timescale for smbhbs with @xmath30 is very long ( y02 ) .",
    "a hard smbhb loses energy and becomes more bound through three - body interaction @xcite . as a result stars intruding a sphere of radius @xmath31 about the mass center of the binary ( if not tidally disrupted or swallowed by the bhs )",
    "will be eventually expelled with an average energy gain @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a dimensionless factor about @xmath34 ( q96 ; y02 ) . in this paper ,",
    "unless noted otherwise , we assume that galaxies are spherical . in a spherical potential",
    "there is just one family of orbits ( centropilic loops ) and any such orbit can be labelled by its four integrals of motion , namely the specific angular momentum @xmath35 and specific binding energy @xmath36 .",
    "we define the _ loss cone _ to consist of all orbits with pericenters less than @xmath17 , which results in a conical region with the boundary given by @xmath37 $ ] . in a non - spherical galaxy angular momentum",
    "is no longer conserved and there can be more than one orbit family .",
    "nevertheless , instead of a `` loss cone '' one can still define a `` loss zone '' inside which stars will be delivered to the smbhb .",
    "mechanisms such as two - body relaxation tend to refill the loss cone so the decay of smbhb continues .",
    "the stars refilled into loss cone are originally far from the smbhb so that @xmath38 and @xmath39 if the characteristic change of @xmath40 during one orbital period of a star is much smaller than @xmath41 , the loss cone refilling behaves like a diffusion process in which the loss cone filling rate is not sensitive to @xmath42 or @xmath17 ( diffusive regime , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . otherwise , the stars entering the loss cone have a uniform distribution with respect to @xmath43 so that the loss cone filling rate is proportional @xmath42 or @xmath17 ( pinhole regime ) .    in inactive galaxies gas dynamics is probably not important , so a hard binary loses energy mainly through interacting with loss cone stars .",
    "the evolution timescale @xmath44 at this hard stage depends on the loss cone filling rate @xmath45 , the number of stars fed into a sphere of radius @xmath17 about the mass center of the binary per unit time . from equation  ( [ deltae ] ) and",

    "a fraction of the stars fed into the loss cone of smbhb would be scattered to the vicinity of a bh and get tidally disrupted . the ratio of the tidal radius of the primary bh and the separation of the binary is about @xmath50 ( from eq .",
    "[ [ rt ] ] and [ [ ahpc ] ] ) , which is small for typical hard smbhbs this implies that most stars in the loss cone would be expelled instead of being tidally disrupted .",
    "to further quantify the probability of tidal disruption , we introduce @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , the cross section for stars to be scattered to a distance less than @xmath53 from the @xmath54th bh . the probability that a loss cone star is disrupted by the @xmath54th bh estimates @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the tidal radius of the @xmath54th bh .",
    "then the stellar disruption rate is related to the loss cone filling rate and the tidal disruption cross section as @xmath57    for a single bh the geometrical cross section can be written out analytically as @xmath58 which increases with the gravitational potential @xmath59 and decreases with stars kinetic energy @xmath60 at infinity .",
    "for bound stars equation  ( [ singlecs ] ) is still valid as long as the stars fall to the bh on near - radial orbits , and in the bound case @xmath61 is the velocity at apocenter .",
    "when gravitational focusing is important ( @xmath62 ) the cross section scales as @xmath53 . in smbhb systems",
    "the presence of a companion bh tends to increase the term @xmath59 by deepening the gravitational potential and also increase the term @xmath60 by inducing orbital motion which raises the relative velocity between each binary member and ambient stars .",
    "therefore in the rest frame of the primary member , the equivalent increase in @xmath63 is @xmath64 and the equivalent increase in @xmath60 is about @xmath65 .",
    "so the cross section of the primary bh is approximately @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a correction factor of order unity .",
    "we will see below that for different @xmath68s the best fit is obtained when @xmath69 . for the secondary , the roles of @xmath14 and @xmath15 exchange , so the cross section can be obtained by replacing @xmath68 in equation  ( [ appcs ] ) with @xmath70 .",
    "quinlan has separately explained the behavior of the cross sections at @xmath71 and @xmath72 from another way of understanding ( q96 ) , while our explanation and empirical formula are general for any @xmath73 .",
    "because of the effect of gr equation  ( [ appcs ] ) is no longer valid when @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the schwarzschild radius . since the ratio of @xmath76 and @xmath77 is @xmath78 gr effect is important when @xmath79 ( @xmath80 for solar type stars ) . in practice , one can use the pseudo - newtonian potential @xmath81 @xcite to simulate the gr effect so equation  ( [ appcs ] ) becomes @xmath82 ( notice that @xmath83 ) , equivalent to multiplying the non - relativistic cross section by a correction factor @xmath84 .",
    "equation  ( [ grappcs ] ) diverges when @xmath85 , but since a star plunging into the sphere of marginally bound radius @xmath86 about a bh eventually falls into to the event horizon , the cross section at @xmath87 $ ] should be constant , equal to the cross section at @xmath88 .",
    "both equation  ( [ appcs ] ) and ( [ grappcs ] ) are evaluated at the first time that a star passes the binary . in some cases",
    "a star could be scatted onto temporally bound orbit and encounters with the binary many times before expelled or disrupted ( @xcite ; q96 ) . during such multi - encounters the probability of tidal disruption is expected to be enhanced .",
    "since it is very difficult to derive analytical cross sections for these complicated encounters , scattering experiments are needed .",

    "we do a second set of calculations with @xmath261 $ ] to account for the flaring rates from the intermediate - mass bhs ( imbhs , @xmath262 ) at the centers of dwarf galaxies , while for binary bhs we skip such calculations because most dwarf galaxies have not experienced mergers @xcite .",
    "the flaring rates at @xmath263 are from the linear extrapolation of the logarithmic flaring rate at @xmath264 .",
    "we do not consider flares produced by giants because we will see below that these flares differ from those produced by normal stars .",
    "our result is not sensitive to this treatment because the mass function of smbhs cuts off steeply above @xmath237 where flares from giants become dominant .",

    "note that taking into account asymmetric stellar distributions and relaxation mechanisms other than two - body interaction would significantly increase the loss cone filling rates in both single and binary bh systems , therefore dramatically increase the flaring rates .",
    "according to table  [ table2 ] , it is obvious that if smbhbs are ubiquitous in the centers of both early and late type galaxies the flaring rate in local universe would be more than one order of magnitude lower than that in single bh case .",
    "it is also clear that dwarf galaxies , if they follow the same mass distribution as that of massive galaxies and harbor imbhs at their centers , would contribute the majority to the flares in late type galaxies but have little effect on the flaring rate in early type galaxies .     +    if a fraction , @xmath278 , of smbhs in the investigated galaxies are in binary and a fraction @xmath279 are single , the expected tidal disruption rate is @xmath280 @xmath281 as a function of @xmath278 is presented in figure  [ constrain ] .",
    "it shows that @xmath281 is not sensitive to @xmath68 unless @xmath282 . in   [ discussion ] we will use these @xmath283 diagrams to constrain @xmath284 for different types of galaxies .",
    "the hierarchical structure formation model in cdm cosmology predicts that smbhbs are continuously formed across the merging history of galaxies . constraining the abundance of smbhbs among inactive galaxies is essential to test the theoretical models of the dynamic evolution of binary bhs . in this paper",
    "we have studied the effect of hard binary bhs on stellar disruption rates , trying to find distinct observational signatures of smbhbs in galaxy centers .",
    "we focus our attention on inactive galaxies which contain the final products of bh mergers so we do not consider the effect of gas on smbhb evolution .",
    "we have carried out numerical scattering experiments designed for hard smbhbs to investigate the probability of stellar disruption . since @xmath285 , in each set of experiments usually a large number of test particles ( @xmath139 ) were used to give statistical meaningful results . for solar type stars",
    "the test particle approximation should be valid outside @xmath77 as long as @xmath286 .",
    "in this situation the self - binding energy of a star @xmath287 is smaller by a factor @xmath288 than its kinetic energy at @xmath77 so the loss of orbital energy due to tidal dissipation is not important .",
    "the test particle approximation may be problematic for giant stars because they are much less concentrated and may suffer from mass stripping during their encounters with bhs .",
    "this uncertainty could be incorporated into the uncertainty in @xmath289 . in single bh case",
    "the stellar disruption rate is not sensitive to @xmath289 if the loss cone is in the diffusive regime but would be proportional to @xmath289 if the loss cone is in the pinhole regime ( mt99 ) . for binary bhs the loss cone filling rate does not depend on @xmath289 but the tidal disruption cross section scales with @xmath289 when gravitational focusing is important . therefore unless the effective @xmath289 deviates significantly from our choice",
    "@xmath252 our results for giant stars would not be qualitatively different .",
    "we find that in binary bh systems the multi - encounter cross sections are greater than the single - encounter ones .",
    "this is because binary bhs tend to scatter particles onto temporary bound orbits which enhances the number of star - binary encounters .",
    "if a star is only partly disrupted during each close passage from the bhs , multi - flares would be produced occur due to the multi - encounters , which provides a distinct observational signature of smbhbs .",
    "however , we have seen in   [ nongrcs ] that the probability of multi - flaring may be extremely low because @xmath290 . even if @xmath291 equation  ( [ rsrt ] ) implies that @xmath292 so gravitational wave radiation would quickly drive the bhs to coalesce , making the multi - flares unlikely .",
    "a secondary flare could also be produced if the secondary member of smbhb captures sufficient debris from the star disrupted by the primary bh , or vise versa .",
    "the probability of these events depends on the opening angle of all the spewed debris about the stellar disrupting bh , which needs to be determined by hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we have shown that the normalized cross sections are not sensitive to the star s initial binding energy or to the eccentricity of the bh binary , but do depend on the amplitude and orientation of the star s initial angular momentum .",
    "the cross sections presented in figures  [ cs001 ] and [ fit ] , which have been equally averaged over the whole loss cone and over all directions , can be directly used if the loss cone of smbhb is isotropic and is in the pinhole regime . in the diffusive loss cone limit the stars falling to the binary bhs satisfy @xmath293 . according to figure  [ dfjdr ] the differential tidal disruption cross sections at @xmath293 are lower than those inside the loss cone , so the mean tidal disruption cross section in the diffusive limit is smaller than those presented in figures  [ cs001 ] and [ fit ] .",
    "we find that the tidal disruption rates in binary bh systems are more than one order of magnitude lower than those in single bh systems .",
    "the suppression of stellar disruption rate by smbhb originates in the low loss cone filling rate in binary bh systems , which results from the stellar cusp destruction due to the hardening of smbhbs .",
    "even efficient loss cone filling mechanisms are taken into account the contrast between the stellar disruption rates in single and binary bh cases are still prominent in less massive galaxies with @xmath231 , because the survival of smbhbs requires that the loss cone filling rate should not exceed a critical value which is proportional to the total bh mass of smbhb .",
    "our result is qualitatively different from that of @xcite , who suggested that a smbhb will enhance the stellar disruption rates .",
    "the difference is due to that we are studying a much later evolution stage at which the dense galactic cusps considered by @xcite have been destroyed during the hardening of smbhbs .",
    "according to the calculation in y02 binary bhs reach the hard radius in about a dynamic friction timescale of the merging galaxy .",
    "so the situation considered by @xcite applies for a short period relative to the lifetime of a galaxy .",
    "@xcite suggested that because loss cone refilling takes time the stellar disruption rate immediately after smbhb coalescence is significantly below the final steady disruption rate . but",
    "this effect is prominent only in massive galaxies with @xmath255 , where the relaxation timescale is long .",
    "our result implies that in less massive galaxies the flaring rate could give stringent constraint to the abundance of smbhb .    in larger galaxies with @xmath255 tidal flares",
    "are dominated by disruption of giants .",
    "however , their spectral and variable properties may be different from those of solar type stars .",
    "a tidal flare is expected to be produced at a scale about @xmath77 , initially radiating at the eddington limit @xmath294 with a thermal spectrum of effective temperature @xmath295^{1/4}=2.4\\times10 ^ 5(r_*/r_\\odot)^{-1/2}(m_*/m_{\\odot})^{1/6}m_8^{1/12}~{\\rm k}$ ] and decaying on a timescale @xmath296 , where @xmath297 characterizes the span of the binding energy of the debris @xcite . for solar type",
    "stars the spectrum of tidal flare peaks at uv or soft x - ray and the luminosity decays in about @xmath298 year . while for giant stars with @xmath299 and @xmath300 the spectrum peaks at optical or uv band and the flare dims on a timescale of about @xmath301 years",
    "therefore if a uv / x - ray outburst decaying within months to one year is detected in a galaxy with total bh mass much greater than @xmath237 ( determined by other observations ) , it is likely that a less massive secondary smbh resides in the galactic center .",
    "such event is another signature of smbhb , though figure  [ giant ] suggests that the frequency of such event is low .",
    "so far six candidate tidal disruption events have been observed in nearby inactive galaxies . among them , one was observed at @xmath302 by the uv telescope _ galex _ @xcite and",
    "the rest were discovered in galaxies at @xmath303 during the one year rosat all sky survey ( _ rass _ ) @xcite .",
    "the hubble types for the host galaxies of the five _ rass _ flares are not well determined : ngc 5905 is of a sb galaxy and the other four galaxies look like ellipticals @xcite . from the observations of _ rass _ @xcite inferred a total flaring rate of @xmath304 for all types of galaxies .",
    "from the _ rass _ results we can also give a rough estimate of the flaring rates for different types of galaxies : @xmath305 for early type galaxies and @xmath306 for late types .",
    "we plot @xmath307 as long - dashed horizontal lines in figure  [ constrain ] and the corresponding uncertainties with shaded areas . because of the poor statistics in @xmath307 and the ill - determination of hubble types of the host galaxies , the results are highly uncertain .",
    "we did the calculation based on the assumptions that galaxies are spherical and two - body scattering relaxation dominates the loss - cone refilling .",
    "however , taking into account more realistic non - spherical stellar distributions and other loss - cone refilling mechanisms besides two - body interaction will probably significantly increase the loss - cone refilling rates in both single and binary smbh systems . mt99 and y02 showed that taking into account axisymmetric stellar distribution will increase the loss cone refilling rates by a factor of @xmath209 for both single smbhs and hard smbhbs .",
    "the loss cone refilling rates in triaxial galaxies are slightly higher than those in axisymmetric ones if the triaxiality is less than @xmath192 but can be two orders of magnitude higher if the triaxiality is more extreme ( y02 ; * ? ? ?",
    "resonant relaxation would increase the loss cone refilling rates by a factor of @xmath308 relative to those in the case of two - body relaxation , depending on the eccentricities of stellar orbits @xcite . to calculate the tidal disruption rates by taking into account the above physical processes",
    "is out of the scope of this paper . to illustrate the effects of increased loss - cone refilling rates and tidal disruption rates on the estimated fraction of binary bhs , @xmath284",
    ", we simply multiply our calculated stellar disruption rates @xmath281 by @xmath209 , @xmath222 , and @xmath309 and plot the results in figure  [ constrain ] . in figure",
    "[ constrain ] , the intersections of long - dashed and solid lines give the lower limit to @xmath278 , while the intersections of long - dashed and dot - dashed lines roughly give the upper limits .",
    "when all types of galaxies are considered , binary fraction @xmath278 is between @xmath310 and @xmath311 . for early type galaxies",
    ", the solid lines do not intersect the long - dashed line , implying that other loss - cone filling mechanisms in addition to two - body relaxation should also be important . for late type galaxies ,",
    "figure  [ constrain ] suggests a binary fraction @xmath312 and that extreme triaxiality may not be common , otherwise the current observation would imply an extremely high fraction of smbhbs .",
    "we would like to note that the constraints on @xmath278 are very uncertain due to the large uncertainty in the current @xmath307 .",
    "detection of more candidate tidal disruption events is needed to give better constraints on @xmath278 and on the dominant loss - cone filling mechanisms in different types of galaxies .",
    "the non - detection of x - ray or uv flares in dwarf galaxies seems inconsistent with the calculated high flaring rates .",
    "the discrepancy may be due to ( 1 ) a lack of sufficient sensitivity in current surveys , ( 2 ) the continuous and steady accretion of stellar debris onto imbhs during successive tidal disruption events @xcite , or ( 3 ) a lack of imbhs in the centers of dwarf galaxies .",
    "future x - ray and uv surveys with improved sensitivity and angular resolution would help constraining the fraction of imbhs in galaxy centers and give interesting implications to the formation and the merging history of imbhs @xcite .",
    "to investigate whether smbhbs are ubiquitous in nearby inactive galaxies or coalesce rapidly in galaxy mergers , we have studied the tidal disruption rates of stellar objects in both single and binary smbh systems .",
    "we have calculated the interaction cross sections between hard smbhbs and intruding stars by carrying out intensive numerical scattering experiments with typically @xmath194 particles , taking into account the initial binding energy and angular momentum of particle , the eccentricity of the orbit of smbhb , and including general relativistic effects .",
    "we have also derived empirical formulae for the relativistic cross sections , which can be applied to smbhbs with a wide range of semimajor axis and todal bh mass .",
    "we have calculated the rate of loss cone refilling due to two - body relaxation for a sample of @xmath198 nearby galaxies , assuming that each galaxy is spherical . the steady loss cone filling rates in binary bh systems",
    "would be significantly suppressed due to the three - body interaction between smbhbs and stars passing by .",
    "we have calculated the tidal disruption rates respectively for single and binary smbhs by combining the loss cone filling rates and the tidal disruption cross sections .",

    "more massive than @xmath237 , a uv / x - ray flare at galactic center decaying within one year provides strong evidence of a secondary bh , although the probability of such events is low .",
    "finally we have calculated the flaring rates in local universe using the bh mass function given in the literature .",
