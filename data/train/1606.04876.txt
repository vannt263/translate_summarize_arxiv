    "grid cells @xcite are neurons in the dorsocodal medial entorhinal cortex of mammals that fire when the animal is near specific locations in its familiar environment ; intriguingly , these locations form , for a single cell , a two - dimensional regular triangular grid @xcite . ever since their discovery , grid cells have been hypothesized to be involved in space representation @xcite , and in particular in neural algorithms _",
    "`` that integrate information about place , distance , and direction '' _",
    "@xcite , a task usually referred to as _ path integration _",
    "but why are neurons with grid - like tuning curves well adapted for the task of path integration ?",
    "this is the question we address in this paper .",
    "path integration presumably entails the measurement of small displacements .",
    "therefore , for path integration to be effective , measurement of small displacements has to be as accurate as possible .",
    "what is the tuning curve , for neurons measuring small displacements , that has the highest possible sensitivity , that is , the smallest possible variance ?",
    "we show that , in one dimension , optimal measurement sensitivity is achieved through a one - dimensional grid .",
    "in particular , we consider a population of neurons measuring small displacements on the circle .",
    "working on the circle instead of the line segment , or the infinite line , simplifies the analysis by avoiding edge effects .",
    "we assume that the tuning curves of these neurons are cyclical shifts of one another , and that the noise of the measurement is gaussian .",
    "we seek the tuning curve maximizing the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "a useful surrogate of accuracy is the _ fisher information _ @xcite , which upper - bounds the accuracy of any estimator .",
    "we establish that the tuning curve maximizing fisher information is a sinusoidal - like wave ( see figure 1 )  that is to say , a tuning curve whose peaks form a grid .",
    "the frequency of the wave is that of the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest positive eigenvalue of the noise correlation matrix .",
    "we say `` sinusoidal - like '' because , mathematically , the optimal solutions form a family of near - sinusoidal functions parametrized by any function @xmath0\\mapsto [ 0,1]$ ] , with the common sinusoid corresponding to the identity function ( notice the differences between the sinusoid - like waves in figure 2 ) .        but",
    "how can the displacement be read out from the change in spiking rates in such a population ?",
    "we notice that the actual displacement can be computed with the help of a second cell population which is identical to the first , albeit with tuning curves phase - shifted by @xmath1 .",
    "this last observation about the computation of displacement is relevant when exploring how our analysis can be extended to two dimensions .",
    "again , in order to avoid edge effects we are working on the torus ( the unit square with its opposite sides identified ) . under quite hefty assumptions ( of independence of both correlation and tuning curves , as well as of independent optimization of sensitivity in each direction ) it can be shown that the optimum tuning curve in two dimensions is indeed a grid .",
    "we speculate that the triangular grid may be the result of optimization of measurement sensitivity under an additional constraint , and that constraint may be computational : in two dimensions , the problem of inferring the displacement from tuning curve change requires not one additional phase - shifted population of cells , but _",
    "three _ such populations .",
    "the interface of the four phase - shifted populations is best achieved through a triangular grid ( figure 3 ) .",
    "[ [ related - work ] ] related work : + + + + + + + + + + + + +    over the past decade , there has been much theoretical investigation of grid cells , their origin , and their role . it has been noted that a grid - like pattern can result from the interference of two , or possibly three , sinusoidal waves @xcite , while periodic tuning curves on the circle @xcite and the torus @xcite can be generated by neural networks ( see figure 3a and b in @xcite ) ; however , these models were not proposed in the context of optimizing the accuracy of measurement . it has also been shown that continuous attractor models can generate triangular grid - like responses @xcite , while experimental data are consistent with a 2-dimensional response of the population @xcite .",
    "grid cells were interpreted in @xcite and , in a different way , in @xcite , as very efficient novel neural codes for encoding position and velocity , and in @xcite it is shown that in this arena grid cells are more apt than place cells ; these works are methodologically close to ours in that they also employ fisher information for their analysis and comparisons  without , however , seeking the tuning curve design that maximizes it .",
    "cells with one - dimensional grid - like firing patterns have also very recently come up in the analysis of the responses of animal grid cells to one - dimensional environments @xcite , characterized as projections ( `` slices '' ) of a two - dimensional lattice to the one - dimensional circumstances of the experiment .",
    "finally , recently it was claimed in @xcite that the tuning curve in one dimension with maximum fisher information is a sinusoid curve , while the product of two such curves is optimum in two dimensions , results very similar to ours ; unfortunately ( as pointed out in sections 2 and 3 ) the mathematical development in that manuscript contains significant gaps .",
    "[ subsec : framework - outline ] consider a population of @xmath2 neurons measuring a small angular displacement at a point on the circle .",
    "we assume that the tuning curves of the @xmath2 neurons are identical , albeit shifted by multiples of the angle @xmath3 .",
    "we seek the tuning curve that maximizes the sensitivity of measuring small displacements .",
    "the neurons respond to an angular stimulus @xmath4 $ ] , and the tuning curve of the @xmath5th neuron is denoted by @xmath6 ; we assume that the tuning curves are identical but shifted by multiples of @xmath7 , that is , @xmath8 .",
    "the average population activity caused by a stimulus is thus the vector @xmath9 .",
    "the derivative @xmath10 is denoted @xmath11 , and we denote by @xmath12 the vector @xmath13 .",
    "a stimulus @xmath14 results in the response @xmath15 , for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is gaussian noise .",
    "the values of noise at different neurons , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are correlated , and this correlation is assumed to be independent of @xmath14 , and denoted @xmath19 , a quantity that depends on the distance on the ring of the neurons @xmath5 and @xmath20 .",
    "it follows that the noise correlation matrix @xmath21 is both circulant and symmetric .",
    "importantly , we also assume that the total signal power  the sum of the squares of the slopes of the tuning curves  is bounded from above by a constant , which we take to be one .",
    "thus @xmath22 for all @xmath14 .",
    "if the stimulus changes from @xmath14 to @xmath23 , this results in population activity @xmath24 . the goal of the decoding system is to estimate @xmath25 from the change in the population response  that is , from @xmath26 . to do this as effectively as possible",
    ", the overall variance of the measurement must be as small as possible . instead of this `` overall variance '' , it is convenient in this context to work with the _ fisher information _ of the population , a function of the tuning curves and the correlation matrix which is known , by the cramer - rao theorem @xcite , to bound from above the accuracy of any any unbiased estimator .",
    "we seek the tuning curves @xmath6 with the largest fisher information under correlation matrix @xmath21 .    under gaussian noise , and the assumption that @xmath21 is nonsingular ,",
    "it is well known @xcite that the fisher information can be written as follows :    @xmath27    thus , we seek the vector @xmath28 satisfying @xmath29 that maximizes the right - hand side of ( 1 ) .    furthermore , @xmath30 is also symmetric , and its eigenvalues are the inverses of the eigenvalues of @xmath31 , while its eigenvectors are the same as those of @xmath31 .",
    "recall now the courant - fischer theorem @xcite ( stated below for the case of real symmetric matrices and the largest eigenvalue only ) :    * ( courant - fischer , 1953 ) * if @xmath32 is symmetric , then the vector @xmath33 in the unit ball @xmath34 that maximizes @xmath35 is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath32 .    comparing with equation ( 1 ) , we conclude that the optimum tuning curve vector @xmath36 has derivative @xmath28 equal to the eigenvector corresponding to the _ smallest _ positive eigenvalue of @xmath31 ( the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath37 ) .",
    "what is this eigenvector ?",
    "since @xmath31 is circulant and symmetric , it is well known @xcite that each eigenvalue @xmath38 , for @xmath39 , has multiplicity two , and the two corresponding eigenvectors are the two sinusoidal waves @xmath40 and @xmath41 :    @xmath42 \\hbox{\\rm \\ \\",

    "we conclude that the optimum tuning curve vector has derivative of the form @xmath46    where @xmath47 and the smallest positive eigenvalue of @xmath21 is @xmath38 .",
    "we now apply the change of variables @xmath48 to obtain    @xmath49    recall that we are assuming that the tuning curves of the @xmath2 neurons are identical , albeit shifted by @xmath44 ; that is , for all @xmath5 and @xmath14 , @xmath50 , and thus @xmath51 . substituting into ( 2 )",
    "we conclude that @xmath52 for all @xmath14 , or equivalently @xmath53 for some integer @xmath54 .",
    "the simplest solution of ( 3 ) is @xmath55 for all @xmath14 and for some constant @xmath56 ( which we take zero without loss of generality ) and integer @xmath54 .",
    "it follows that @xmath57 and thus @xmath58 where @xmath59 for some integer @xmath54 ( positive , zero , or negative ) , and we took the constant of the integration to be @xmath60",
    "so the tuning curve takes only positive values .",
    "however , ( 3 ) has many more solutions .",
    "let @xmath61 be any function mapping @xmath62 $ ] to the reals , and , for any @xmath63 $ ] , define @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 by the equation @xmath66 .",
    "then the function @xmath67 is also the derivative of an optimal tuning curve .",
    "indicatively , in figure 2 we show the tuning curves resulting from six simple functions @xmath68 , including @xmath69 ( the true sinusoid ) .    0.25     0.25     0.25     .25     0.25     0.25",
    "in view of the one - dimensional result , one may suspect that grid - like structures may also be optimal in two dimensions . intuitively , it is tempting to try and reduce the two - dimensional case to the one - dimensional case just solved , and show that the optimum two - dimensional tuning curve must be the product of two sinusoids , and therefore a grid .",
    "unfortunately , this matter turns out to be quite a bit more complicated .",
    "assume a population of neurons measuring displacements on the torus ( the product of two circles , or , equivalently , a square with opposite edges identified in the parallel way ) , whose tuning curves are shifts of one another along some lattice on the torus defined by the unit vectors along two different directions @xmath33 and @xmath70 ( not necessarily orthogonal ) .",
    "we make some additional assumptions :    * the noise correlations in the @xmath33 and @xmath70 directions have the same form and are independent of each other .",
    "that is , the correlation tensor decomposes into the product of two identical correlation matrices .",
    "* we further assume that the tuning curve of the neurons can also be decomposed as the product of identical one - dimensional tuning curves in the @xmath33 and @xmath70 dimensions .",
    "it then follows that the fisher information in the @xmath33 dimension has the form @xmath71\\cdot \\left[(f_y(y)^t c^{-1 } f_y(y))\\right],\\eqno{(5)}\\ ] ] and similarly for the @xmath70 direction . *",
    "identifying the optimum tuning curve , even under these assumptions , is still ill - defined , because of the possibly unbounded second factor in ( 5 ) : @xmath72 must be obtained by integrating @xmath73 , a step that introduces an unbounded integration constant .",
    "we could of course impose an upper bound on @xmath72  a justified assumption since neurons can not fire at arbitrarily high rates ,  but then the optimization problem becomes an intractable one , involving integral inequality constraints . we can obtain a meaningful solution only under one additional assumption : that the fisher information in each of the @xmath33 and @xmath70 directions is maximized _ independently of the other direction . _",
    "that is , the overall sensitivity is not maximized , and instead the sensitivities along the two directions @xmath33 and @xmath70 are maximized separately , yielding an overall suboptimal solution .",
    "this is not implausible , if one considers the independent evolution of two separate modules , each measuring displacement in one of the two directions .    under these assumptions , the result for the one - dimensional case does generalize immediately , and the tuning curve maximizing the fisher information at all stimuli turns out to be the outer product of near - sinusoidal waves in the @xmath33 and @xmath70 directions .",
    "if the two directions form an angle of @xmath74 , the familiar triangular grid results .",
    "the idea that the triangular firing field structure can result from the interference of two oscillations has been suggested before @xcite ; however , the advantage of this structure was unclear .    but why should the two directions @xmath33 and @xmath70 be at an angle of @xmath74 to form the familiar triangular grid observed in @xcite ?",
    "one possible answer comes from algorithmic considerations , discussed next .",
    "consider a population of cells around the circle as in the previous section with the sinusoid tuning curve @xmath75 in ( 4 ) above , measuring ( under noise ) the change in firing rate @xmath76 .",
    "what is the mechanism whereby the displacement @xmath77 is inferred from the measurement of @xmath78 ?",
    "this seems problematic , since the value of the stimulus @xmath14 appears to be needed , and keeping track of @xmath14 is the purpose of path integration ... but upon closer consideration , we note that the decoding mechanism does not quite need the stimulus @xmath14 , but just its cosine . recall that , as @xmath77 goes to zero , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 .",
    "hence , @xmath81 in the one - dimensional case , this additional information can be obtained with a very simple architecture : suppose that there is a _ second _ population of neurons , with identical tuning curve @xmath82 with the primary population , albeit shifted by an angle @xmath83 ; say @xmath84 .",
    "then this new population yields a similar equation , with @xmath85 replacing @xmath86 because of the phase shift : @xmath87 thus we have two trigonometric equations for the two unknowns @xmath77 and @xmath88 , which can be easily solved : by dividing ( 6 ) by ( 7 ) we note that @xmath89 , and hence @xmath90 that is , the displacement measurement can be computed from the two populations . we conclude that , in one dimension , a second identical population of neurons shifted by @xmath91 suffices for an effective readout .",
    "now in two dimensions , the equivalent of ( 6 ) is @xmath92 notice that now there are _ four _ unknowns ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 ) .",
    "we conclude that _ three _ additional populations of neurons seem to be required , with different two - dimensional shifts from the original one .",
    "the most natural way to implement such a scheme is through shifts in three directions , forming equal angles of @xmath74 with each other ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "hence the familiar triangular grid may be the most natural way to implement this mechanism .",
    "further analytical articulation of this point is the subject of future work .    in 0,2,4 in 0,4 ( ) at ( 2*,2 * ) @xmath32 ;    in 1,3,5 in 0,4 ( ) at ( 2*,2 * ) @xmath97 ;    in 0,2,4 in 2 ( ) at ( 2*,2 * ) @xmath97 ;    in 1,3,5 in 2 ( ) at ( 2*,2 * ) @xmath32 ;    in 0,2,4 in 2 ( ) at ( 2*,2 * ) @xmath97 ;    in 0,2,4 in 1 ( ) at ( 2*+1,2 * ) @xmath98 ;    in 1,3 in 1 ( ) at ( 2*+1,2 * ) @xmath21 ;    in 0,2,4 in 3 ( ) at ( 2*+1,2 * ) @xmath21 ;    in 1,3 in 3 ( ) at ( 2*+1,2 * ) @xmath98 ;    in 0, ... ,4 ( 4)(4 ) ;    in 0, ... ,4 in 0,2 ( )  ( ) ( )  ( ) ;    in 0, ... ,3 in 1,3 ( )  ( ) ( )  ( ) ;    in 0, ... ,4 in 1,3 ( )  ( ) ( )  ( ) ;    ( 42)(41 ) ( 44)(43 ) ;",
    "what is the origin and utility of the grid cells distinctive firing field , and what does it have to do with path integration ?",
    "we have shown that , in one dimension , the tuning curve that optimizes the accuracy of displacement measurements is a near - sinusoid wave , whose peaks naturally form a one - dimensional grid . in two dimensions , we needed several further assumptions in order to show that the optimum tuning curve is the product of two sinusoidal waves in two non - parallel directions .",
    "if these two directions form an angle of @xmath99 , the familiar triangular grid results . we have also presented ideas about a possible mechanism for computing the change in position from the change in the response . for two dimensions ,",
    "our proposed mechanism predicts the existence of four populations of grid cells with regularly displaced firing fields , and suggests that the triangular architecture may be the optimum solution of the joint problem of maximizing both sensitivity and accuracy of decoding .",
    "one may further speculate about grid cells for _ three dimensions _ ( relevant for animals such as bats and sea mammals ) . here",
    ", our analysis predicts a total of _ six _ populations , and these must be interlaced in a way analogous to that in figure 3 .",
    "the arrangement in figure 3 works because the simple triangular lattice of one population , say population a , if copied three times and appropriately shifted , has the property that each point has at least one neighbor from each of the other three populations .",
    "this suggests the following technical question in 3-dimensional geometry : is there a lattice in three dimensions with the property that , if it is duplicated six times , each point of each copy of the lattice is adjacent to at least one point from each of the other five copies ?",
    "it turns out that the lattice generated by the vectors @xmath100 has this property : notice that the corresponding matrix has determinant @xmath101 , suggesting that six copies of the lattice can be arranged in space , and it is easy to check that each point of each copy is at distance one from a point from each of the other copies .",
    "therefore , intriguing compromises do exist between the design of a neural architecture for path integration in three dimensions and the realities of three - dimensional geometry .",
