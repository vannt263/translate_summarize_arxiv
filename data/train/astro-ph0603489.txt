    "the impressive discoveries of large extrasolar planets over the past decade has inspired widespread interest in finding and directly imaging earth - like planets in the habitable zones of nearby stars .",
    "in fact , nasa has plans to launch two space telescopes to accomplish this , the terrestrial planet finder coronagraph ( tpf - c ) and the terrestrial planet finder interferometer ( tpf - i ) , while the european space agency is planning a similar multi - satellite mission called darwin .",
    "these missions are currently in the concept study phase . in addition",
    ", numerous ground - based searches are proceeding using both coronagraphic and interferometric approaches .",
    "direct imaging of earth - like extrasolar planets poses extremely challenging problems . to see why , consider viewing our solar system from a good distance ( say from another nearby star system )",
    ", our sun would appear @xmath0 times brighter than earth .",
    "hence , we need an imaging system capable of detecting planets that are @xmath1 orders of magnitude fainter than the star they orbit . such a system is referred to as a high - contrast imager .",
    "furthermore , given the distances involved , the angular separation for most targets is very small , requiring the largest launchable telescope possible .",
    "for tpf - c , for example , the current baseline design involves a traditional _ lyot coronagraph _ consisting of a modern 8th - order occulting mask attached to the back end of a ritchey - chretien telescope having an @xmath2 m by @xmath3 m elliptical primary mirror ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alternative innovative back - end designs still being considered include _ shaped pupils _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , a _ visible nuller _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and _ pupil mapping _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite where this technique is called phase - induced amplitude apodization or piaa ) . by pupil mapping",
    "we mean a system of two lenses , or mirrors , that take a flat input field at the entrance pupil and produce an output field that is amplitude modified but still flat in phase ( at least for on - axis sources ) .",
    "pupil mapping has received considerable attention recently because of its high throughput and small effective inner working angle ( iwa ) .",
    "these benefits could potentially permit more observations over the mission lifetime , or conversely , a smaller and cheaper overall telescope . as a result , there have been numerous studies over the past year to examine the performance of pupil mapping systems .",
    "in particular , in @xcite and @xcite , formulas for the optical surfaces were derived using ray optics .",
    "however , this analysis failed to account for the complete diffraction through a pupil mapping system .",
    "more recently , @xcite provided a detailed diffraction analysis .",
    "unfortunately , this analysis showed that a pure pupil mapping system can not achieve the needed @xmath4 contrast ; the diffraction effects from the pupil mapping systems themselves are so detrimental that contrast attained at the first image plane is limited to @xmath5 . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a hybrid pupil mapping system was proposed that combines the pupil mapping mirrors with a slight apodization of oversized entrance and exit pupils .",
    "this combination does indeed achieve the needed high - contrast point spread function ( psf ) . in what follows",
    ", we will refer to such apodized pupil mapping simply as _ pupil mapping _ , and use the term _ pure pupil mapping _ to refer to the original unapodized system .",
    "what remains to be answered is how pupil mapping behaves in the presence of optical aberrations .",
    "it is essential that contrast be maintained during an observation while the system is being aberrated due to the small dynamic perturbations of the primary mirror .",
    "an understanding of this sensitivity is critical to the design of tpf - c or any other observatory . in @xcite , a detailed sensitivity analysis of both shaped pupils and lyot coronagraphs",
    "@xcite introduced an 8th order image plane mask for the lyot coronagraph that reduces the sensitivity to low - order aberrations to the level of shaped pupils .",
    "both of these design approaches achieve the needed sensitivity for a realizable mission . up to now , however , no comparable study has been done for pupil mapping .    in this paper , we present an efficient method for computing the effects of wavefront aberrations on pupil mapping .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the design of pupil mapping systems in section [ sec : review ] .",
    "we then present in section [ sec : math ] a semi - analytical approach to computing the psf of a pupil - mapping system in the presence of aberrations represented by zernike polynomials .",
    "the assumption of zernikes allows an analytical treatment of the azimuthal angle , reducing the computational problem from a double integral to a few single ones , thus eliminating the need for massive computing power .",
    "we also show how these methods can be used to compute psfs for a purely apodizing coronagraph in section [ sec : sensapod ] as well as off - axis psfs in section [ sec : offaxis ] .",
    "we conclude section [ sec : huygens ] with a sensitivity analysis of pupil mapping systems in section [ sec : analysis of sensitivity ] , showing the degradation of contrast and inner working angle with zernike order and rms amplitude .",
    "we also demonstrate the achievable contrast limit of the current pupil mapping approach . in section [ sec : sensconc ] , we repeat the sensitivity analysis for an alternative coronagraph design , the shaped pupil coronagraph with concentric ring masks , and compare to pupil mapping .",
    "in particular , we show that the pupil mapping approach to high - contrast is more sensitive to aberrations than a purely apodized one , possibly making it more difficult to exploit the inner working angle advantage of pupil mapping .",
    "we begin by summarizing the ray - optics description of pure pupil mapping .",
    "an on - axis ray entering the first pupil at radius @xmath6 from the center is to be mapped to radius @xmath7 at the exit pupil .",
    "optical elements at the two pupils ensure that the exit ray is parallel to the entering ray . the function @xmath8 is assumed to be positive and increasing or , sometimes , negative and decreasing . in either case , the function has an inverse that allows us to recapture @xmath6 as a function of @xmath9 : @xmath10 . the purpose of pupil mapping is to create nontrivial amplitude profiles .",
    "an amplitude profile function @xmath11 specifies the ratio between the output amplitude at @xmath9 to the input amplitude at @xmath6 ( in a pure pupil - mapping system the input amplitude is constant ) .",
    "@xcite showed that for any amplitude profile @xmath11 there is a pupil mapping function @xmath12 that achieves this profile .",
    "specifically , the pupil mapping is given by @xmath13 furthermore , if we consider the case of a pair of lenses that are plano on their outward - facing surfaces , then the inward - facing surface profiles , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , that are required to obtain the desired pupil mapping are given by the solutions to the following ordinary differential equations : @xmath16 and @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the refractive index and @xmath19 is a constant determined by the distance @xmath20 separating the centers ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) of the two lenses : @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the distance between a point on the first lens surface @xmath6 units from the center and the corresponding point on the second lens surface @xmath9 units from its center .",
    "up to an additive constant , the optical path length of a ray that exits at radius @xmath9 after entering at radius @xmath10 is given by @xmath25 @xcite showed that , for an on - axis source , @xmath26 is constant and equal to @xmath19 .",
    "if we assume that a collimated beam with amplitude profile @xmath11 such as one obtains as the output of a pupil mapping system is passed into an ideal imaging system with focal length @xmath27 , the electric field @xmath28 at the image plane is given by the fourier transform of @xmath11 : @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the input amplitude which , unless otherwise noted , we take to be unity .",
    "since the optics are azimuthally symmetric , it is convenient to use polar coordinates .",
    "the amplitude profile @xmath31 is a function of @xmath32 and the image - plane electric field depends only on image - plane radius @xmath33 : @xmath34 the point - spread function ( psf ) is the square of the electric field : @xmath35 for the purpose of terrestrial planet finding , it is important to construct an amplitude profile for which the psf at small nonzero angles is ten orders of magnitude reduced from its value at zero .",
    "@xcite explains how these functions are computed as solutions to certain optimization problems .",
    "the high - contrast amplitude profile used in the rest of this paper is shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we end this section by noting that the need to design customized amplitude profiles arise in many areas , usually in the context of apodization  i.e .",
    ", profiles that only attenuate the beam .",
    "@xcite was perhaps the first to study this problem carefully .",
    "for some recent applications , the reader is refered to the following papers in the area of beam shaping : @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that pure pupil mapping systems designed for contrast of @xmath4 actually achieve much less than this due to harmful diffraction effects that are not captured by the simple ray tracing analysis outlined in the previous section .",
    "for most systems of practical real - world interest ( i.e. , systems with apertures of a few inches and designed for visible light ) , contrast is limited to about @xmath5 . in @xcite",
    ", certain hybrid designs were considered that improve on this level of performance but none of the hybrid designs presented there completely overcame this diffraction - induced contrast degradation .    in this section ,",
    "we describe an apodized pupil mapping system that is somewhat more complicated than the designs presented in @xcite .",
    "this hybrid design , based on ideas proposed by olivier guyon and eugene pluzhnik ( see @xcite ) , involves three additional components .",
    "they are    1 .   a preapodizer @xmath36 to soften the edge of the first lens / mirror so as to minimize diffraction effects caused by hard edges , 2 .   a postapodizer to smooth out low spatial frequency ripples produced by diffraction effects induced by the pupil mapping system itself , and 3",
    "a backend phase shifter to smooth out low spatial frequency ripples in phase .",
    "note that the backend phase shifter can be built into the second lens / mirror .",
    "there are several choices for the preapodizer . for this paper",
    ", we use the preapodizer given by eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the maximum value of @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a scalar parameter , which we take to be @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to see that    * @xmath42 for all @xmath6 , * @xmath43 approaches @xmath44 as @xmath39 approaches @xmath38 , and * @xmath43 approaches @xmath45 as @xmath39 approaches @xmath45 .",
    "incorporating a post - apodizer introduces a degree of freedom that is lacking in a pure pupil mapping system .",
    "namely , it is possible to design the pupil mapping system based on an arbitrary amplitude profile and then convert this profile to a high - contrast profile via an appropriate choice of backend apodizer .",
    "we have found that a simple gaussian amplitude profile that approximately matches a high - contrast profile works very well . specifically , we used @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the radius of the second lens / mirror .",
    "the backend apodization is computed by taking the actual output amplitude profile as computed by a careful diffraction analysis , smoothing it by convolution with a gaussian distribution , and then apodizing according to the ratio of the desired high - contrast amplitude profile @xmath11 divided by the smoothed output profile .",
    "of course , since a true apodization can never intensify a beam , this ratio must be further scaled down so that it is nowhere greater than unity .",
    "the gaussian convolution kernel we used has mean zero and standard deviation @xmath48 .",
    "the backend phase modification is computed by a similar smoothing operation applied to the output phase profile . of course , the smoothed output phase profile ( measured in radians )",
    "must be converted to a surface profile ( having units of length ) .",
    "this conversion requires us to assume a certain specific wavelength . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting design is correct only at one wavelength .",
    "the ability of the system to achieve high contrast degrades as one moves away from the design wavelength .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows plots characterizing the performance of the apodized pupil mapping system described in this section .",
    "the specifications for this system are as follows .",
    "the designed - for wavelength is @xmath49 nm . the optical elements are assumed to be mirrors separated by @xmath50 m .",
    "the system is an on - axis system and we therefore make the non - physical assumption that the mirrors do nt obstruct the beam . that is , the mirrors are invisible except when they are needed .",
    "the mirrors take as input a @xmath51 m on - axis beam and produce a @xmath51 m pupil - remapped exit beam .",
    "the second mirror is oversized by a factor of two ; that is , its diameter is @xmath52 m .",
    "the postapodizer ensures that only the central half contributes to the exit beam .",
    "the first mirror is also oversized appropriately as shown in the upper - right subplot of figure [ fig:2 ] .    after the second mirror , the exit beam is brought to a focus . the focal length is @xmath53 m .",
    "the lower - right subplot in figure [ fig:2 ] shows the ideal psf ( in black ) together with the achieved psf at three wavelengths : at @xmath54 ( green ) , @xmath55 ( blue ) , and @xmath56 ( red ) of the design wavelength . at the design wavelength ,",
    "the achieved psf matches the ideal psf almost exactly .",
    "note that there is minor degradation at the other two wavelengths mostly at low spatial frequencies .",
    "it is important to note that the psfs in figure [ fig:2 ] correspond to a bright on - axis source ( i.e. , a star ) .",
    "off - axis sources , such as faint planets , undergo two effects in a pupil mapping system that differ from the response of a conventional imaging system : an effective magnification and a distortion .",
    "these are explained in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the magnification , in particular , is due to an effective narrowing of the exit pupil as compared to the entrance pupil .",
    "it is this magnification that provides pupil mapped systems their smaller effective inner working angle .",
    "the techniques in section [ sec : huygens ] will allow us to compute the exact off - axis diffraction pattern of an apodized pupil mapped coronagraph and thus to see these effects .",
    "while the effective magnification of a pupil mapping system results in an inner working angle advantage of about a factor of two , it does not produce high - quaity diffraction limited images of off - axis sources because of the distortion inherent in the system .",
    "@xcite proposed the following solution to this problem .",
    "he suggested using this system merely as a mechanism for concentrating ( on - axis ) starlight in an image plane .",
    "he then proposed that an occulter be placed in the image plane to remove the starlight .",
    "all other light , such as the distorted off - axis planet light , would be allowed to pass through the image plane . on the back side",
    "would be a second , identical pupil mapping system ( with the apodizers removed ) , that would `` umap '' the off - axis beam and thus remove the distortions introduced by the first system ( except for some beam walk ",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "a general 2d diffraction analysis of a pupil mapping system with a possibly aberrated input field requires significant computing power . in this section",
    ", we present a much more efficient method assuming the aberrations are zernike polynomials , which allows us to treat the azimuthal variables analytically . in particular , we perform a full end - to - end diffraction analysis of an apodized pupil mapping system with aberrations , as well as with a tilted field such as one from an off - axis planet . such an analysis is required to determine the sensitivity of these systems to phase errors at the input pupil , as well as the off - axis response . at the end of this section , we describe the results for specific cases of interest .      if we assume that a flat , on - axis , electric field arrives at the entrance pupil , then the electric field at a particular point of the exit pupil can be well - approximated by superimposing the phase - shifted waves from each point across the entrance pupil ( this is the well - known huygens - fresnel principle  see , e.g. , section 8.2 in @xcite ) . for an apodized pupil mapping system , we can write this as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the optical path length , @xmath59 is the distance between the plano lens surfaces ( i.e. , a constant slightly larger than @xmath20 ) , @xmath60 denotes the input amplitude apodization at radius @xmath6 , @xmath61 denotes the output amplitude apodization at radius @xmath9 , and where , of course , we have used @xmath6 and @xmath9 as shorthands for the radii in the entrance and exit pupils , respectively .",
    "if the arriving field is not flat but instead has a phase profile given by @xmath62 , then the integral must include this phase shift : @xmath63 as before , it is convenient to work in polar coordinates : @xmath64 where @xmath65 for numerical tractability , it is essential to make approximations so that the integral over @xmath66 can be carried out analytically . to this end , we need to make an appropriate approximation to the square root term : @xmath67    we approximate the @xmath68 amplitude - reduction factor in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) by the constant @xmath69 ( the _ paraxial approximation _ ) .",
    "the @xmath70 appearing in the exponential must , on the other hand , be treated with care .",
    "recall that @xmath71 is a constant .",
    "since constant phase shifts are immaterial , we can subtract it from @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) to get @xmath73 next , we write the difference in @xmath74 s as follows : @xmath75 and then we expand out the numerator and cancel big terms that can be subtracted one from another to get @xmath76 when @xmath10 and @xmath77 , the right - hand side clearly vanishes as it should .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath6 close to @xmath12 and @xmath66 close to @xmath78 , the right - hand side gives an accurate formula for computing the deviation from zero .",
    "that is to say , the right - hand side is easy to program in such a manner as to avoid subtracting one large number from another , which is always the biggest danger in numerical computation .",
    "so far , everything is exact ( except for the paraxial approximation ) .",
    "the only further approximation we make is to replace @xmath79 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ 142 ] ) with @xmath80 so that the denominator becomes just @xmath81 . since @xmath80 appears many times in coming formulas , we abbreviate it as @xmath82 and hope this does not create any confusion . putting this altogether ,",
    "we get a new approximation , which we refer to as the _ huygens _ approximation : @xmath83 where @xmath84    suppose now that the aberration is given by the @xmath85-th zernike polynomial @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a small number . in this case",
    ", the kernel @xmath88 can be expressed in terms of bessel functions .",
    "recall that the @xmath18-th bessel function @xmath89 is defined by the requirement that @xmath90 be the @xmath18-th fourier coefficient in the fourier series expansion of @xmath91 .",
    "that is , @xmath92 the fourier series then , of course , is simply @xmath93 this series is usually referred to as the _ jacobi - anger expansion_.    plugging the zernike polynomial into the definition of the kernel @xmath88 and substituting a jacobi - anger expansion for each of the two cosine - exponentials , we get that @xmath94 where @xmath95 the second to the last equality above follows from the trivial fact that @xmath96 substituting eq .",
    "( [ 147 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 160 ] ) , we can write @xmath97 where @xmath98    ignoring a complex unit exponential , the electric field in the image plane is just the fourier transform of the electric field in the pupil plane . working in polar coordinates , we have @xmath99 from the definition ( eq . ( [ 148 ] ) ) of the bessel functions as certain fourier coefficients , we get @xmath100 substituting eq .",
    "( [ 150 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 161 ] ) , we get @xmath101 where @xmath102 finally , since @xmath103 = @xmath104 , we see that @xmath105    note that @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "hence , if we assume that @xmath108 , then the error incurred by dropping all terms in the sum on @xmath109 for which @xmath110 will be approximately @xmath111 at the most .",
    "hence , any error in the psf will be at the @xmath112 level .",
    "thus , for a given zernike polynomial aberration at the entrance pupil and @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ 155 ] ) can be used to compute the resulting response of the apodized pupil mapping system .",
    "note that an arbitrary aberration can be expressed as a linear combination of zernike polynomials and , for each zernike , the azimuthal variable can be integrated explicitly , thereby reducing 2d integrals to sums of 1d integrals .",
    "if we set @xmath113 for all @xmath9 , then the pupil mapping system reduces to a trivial forward propagation of a flat beam . that is , the lenses / mirrors have perfectly flat surfaces and no remapping occurs .",
    "hence , in this case , the hybrid system becomes a pure apodization system with the desired high - contrast apodization being achieved by a pair of apodizers , one appearing before the beam is propagated and one after ( except for the fresnel diffraction due to the propagation between the two mirrors . ) in this fashion , the mathematics developed in [ sec : math ] can be applied to a pure pupil - apodization coronagraph .",
    "in addition to modeling optical aberrations , the equations in section [ sec : math ] can be used to model off - axis sources such as planets because they are mathematically equivalent to large tilt aberrations .",
    "for example , a 1au planet at 10pc is equivalent to a tilt aberration of @xmath41 arcseconds . for a @xmath114 meter aperture and @xmath115 nm",
    ", this would correspond to an angle of @xmath116 and @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : tilt ] is a contrast plot showing the result of computing eq .",
    "( [ 155 ] ) for such a planet , along with a simulation for a pure pupil - apodizing coronagraph .",
    "in addition , an on - axis star was added in both cases that is @xmath118 times brighter than the planet .",
    "we assumed a coronagraph entrance aperture of @xmath119 mm , and a focal length of @xmath53 m , so that for the apodizing coronagraph , or any conventional imaging system , the planet appears at roughly @xmath120 m off - axis in the image plane .",
    "as mentioned before , pupil mapping both magnifies , which is good , and distorts , which is bad .",
    "both effects are evident in figure [ fig : tilt ] .",
    "the magnification moves the center of the distorted planet image out by roughly a factor of @xmath121 ( to about 400@xmath122 m in figure [ fig : tilt ] ) .",
    "thus , the inner working angle of the system is effectively reduced , which is one of the benefits of pupil mapping . on the other hand , pupil mapping distorts the planet , which reduces the peak intensity a little with respect to the star s peak intensity .",
    "however , note that figure [ fig : tilt ] shows contrast plots , i.e. intensity is normalized to peak star intensity for each case . on an absolute intensity scale , the whole pupil mapping curve will be higher because of the throughput advantage . also note that the distortion caused by the two - mirror system can be countered by inverting the pupil mapping after starlight has been blocked , as described at the end of section [ sec : hybrid ] .",
    "figures [ fig:3 ] to [ fig:6 ] show sensitivity results for the apodized pupil mapping system described in section [ sec : hybrid ] .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] is for aberrations that are @xmath123-th wave rms whereas figure [ fig:4 ] is for smaller @xmath124-th wave rms aberrations .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] shows radial cross - sections and figure [ fig:6 ] shows differences between the radial cross - sections of the aberrated and un - aberrated psf s .",
    "( as noted , the @xmath125 , or piston , zernike is differenced with the ideal psf . )",
    "note that these plots show the psf for an on - axis source , i.e. a star . by comparing these plots to figure [ fig : tilt ]",
    ", one can directly compare the levels of the aberrations to the psf of an off - axis planet .",
    "two important effects are evident in figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "first , the @xmath125 , or piston , zernike represents the nominally achieved contrast and so its difference with the ideal shows the limitation of the current design approach .",
    "any additional errors due to the zernike aberrations , as shown in the subsequent subplots ( which are differenced with the nominal @xmath125 psf ) , add to this static limit .",
    "second , the pupil - mapping system shows a degradation in inner working angle with increasing zernike and increasing aberration size .",
    "any design that attempts to exploit the inherent magnification to achieve a smaller inner working angle must be able to achieve a higher level of aberration control .",
    "another important issue to consider is the sensitivity to aberrations at wavelengths other than the design wavelength .",
    "comparing figure [ fig:5 ] with the bottom - right subplot of figure [ fig:2 ] , it is evident that the degradation due to aberrations at @xmath124 wave level are generally higher than the degradation due to detuning of the wavelength by a factor of @xmath126 or @xmath127 .",
    "thus , the sensitivity to aberrations at these wavelengths should look very similar to figure [ fig:5 ] .",
    "our simulations do indeed confirm this .",
    "of course , at the longer wavelength , the aberrated psf in figure [ fig:5 ] would be expanded by the appropriate amount , and contracted for the shorter wavelength .",
    "for comparison purposes , we now consider a high - contrast imaging system based on a simple concentric rings shaped pupil as described in @xcite .",
    "a concentric - ring pupil - plane mask can be thought of as a circularly symmetric binary apodization .",
    "hence , we assume that we are given such an apodization function @xmath39 .    as before",
    ", we assume that the input electric field could involve some aberration given by @xmath128 .",
    "the image plane electric field is given by the fourier transform of the pupil - plane field , which in polar coordinates is @xmath129 expanding the two exponentials in a jacobi - anger expansion , we get that @xmath130      a(r ) r dr   .\\ ] ] the integral in brackets is easily solved , as before , eliminating one of the summations . with some rearranging , this yields @xmath131 finally , we use the symmetry property of the bessel functions ( @xmath132 ) to yield the image plane field , @xmath133 where @xmath134 for a concentric ring mask having its edges at @xmath135 , the formula for @xmath103 simplifies to @xmath136    figures [ fig:7 ] to [ fig:10 ] show sensitivity results for a high - contrast concentric - ring pupil mask .",
    "we also computed sensitivity results for the pure apodizing system ; they appeared virtually identical to the results shown in these figures , which agree with the results in @xcite .",
    "likewise , the off - axis results are indistinguishable from those of the pure apodizing system in figure [ fig : tilt ] .",
    "in this paper we presented an efficient method for calculating the distortions in the psf of a pupil mapping system due to wavefront aberrations .",
    "figures [ fig:3 ] to [ fig:10 ] show that our particular pupil mapping system is somewhat more sensitive to low order aberrations than the concentric ring masks .",
    "that is , contrast and iwa degrade more rapidly with increasing rms level of the aberrations .",
    "however , this is partially mitigated by the magnification property of pupil mapping , making a direct comparison of the two systems more subtle , especially considering the distortion in pupil mapping .",
    "( a more direct comparison can be made for a pupil mapping that undoes the distortion , such as the unmapping system described at the end of section [ sec : hybrid ] , but that is outside the scope of this article . ) in any case , it is evident that especially fine control of static and dynamic stability will be required in order to take full advantage of the smaller iwa intrinsic to the pupil mapping approach .",
    "a careful stability analysis of any design employing pupil mapping is thus necessary to determine its achievable operating range .",
    "finally , we note that there is a spectrum of apodized pupil mapping systems .",
    "the two extremes , pure apodization and pure pupil mapping , both have serious drawbacks . on the one end ,",
    "pure apodization loses almost an order of magnitude in throughput and suffers from an unpleasantly large iwa . at the other extreme",
    ", pure pupil mapping fails to achieve the required high contrast .",
    "there are several points along this spectrum that are superior to the end points .",
    "we have focused on just one such point , which was suggested by @xcite .",
    "we leave it to future work to determine if this is the best design point . with this paper , we have provided the tools to analyze the sensitivity of these kinds of designs .",

    "<S> in particular , we show how contrast and inner working angle degrade with increasing zernike order and rms amplitude , which has obvious ramifications for the stability requirements and overall design of a planet - finding observatory . </S>"
