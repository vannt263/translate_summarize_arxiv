    "sgr  a * , the extremely compact non - thermal radio source at the galactic center , is a best candidate for a single super - massive black hole ( smbh ) from both the observational studies and the theoretical models ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . the determination of the orbital motions of those early - type stars within the vicinity of sgr  a * reveal a central dark mass about 4@xmath0 within a radius of about 45 au @xcite . on the other hand , the upper limit to the intrinsic proper motion of sgr  a * itself sets a lower limit of 0.4@xmath1 to the mass directly associated with sgr  a * @xcite .",
    "now we can say that we have known the mass of sgr  a * to a great extent , the main uncertainty being the exact distance to the galactic center . but",
    "how big it is , and what it looks like , are different questions .",
    "vlbi observations can provide the highest angular resolution achievable with any astronomical instruments @xcite . at a distance of 8 kc to sgr  a * at the galactic center @xcite , an angular separation of 1 mill - arcsecond ( mas ) corresponds to a linear size of 8 au .",
    "the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath2 ) of a 4@xmath1 smbh is 1.2@xmath310@xmath4 cm , or 0.08 au or 10 micro - arcsecond ( @xmath5as ) in angular size . indeed ,",
    "sgr  a * is the closest smbh candidate with the largest angular size of its schwarzschild radius on the sky , and thus one of the best prime targets for the vlbi observational study .",
    "attempts to measure the sgr  a * structure with high - resolution vlbi observations at centimeter ( cm ) wavelength have suffered from the angular broadening caused by the diffractive scattering by the ionized interstellar medium , which dominates the resultant images with a @xmath6-dependence apparent size , that is , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the observed full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) in mas at a wavelength @xmath9 in cm , and equals @xmath10 at 1 cm .",
    "this tells us that the cm radio emission of sgr  a * comes from a region that extends to observers a much smaller angle than the scattering angular size .",
    "however , following the @xmath6-dependent scattering law , the scattering angle decreases very fast with the observing wavelength .",
    "so it can be expected that vlbi observations at millimeter ( mm ) wavelength , where the pure scattering angular size could become small enough to be comparable to the intrinsic ( finite ) size of sgr  a * , would show deviations of the observed apparent size from the scattering law .",
    "unlike the cm - vlbi observations , the mm - vlbi observations are severely limited by the atmosphere due to the fact that sgr  a * has a southerly declination ( @xmath11 ) and most existing vlbi antennas are located in the northern hemisphere .",
    "therefore , most of the observational data of sgr  a * were taken at low elevation angles ( @xmath12 ) where atmospheric effects are substantial . furthermore , the short and variable coherence time at mm wavelength , combined with the compromised sensitivity due to the high system temperature and the lower antenna efficiency of mm vlbi antennas , seriously limits the high signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) detections of mm - vlbi observations of sgr  a*. as a consequence , there are large uncertainties in the results obtained from the conventional imaging process , i.e. the self - calibration technique for vlbi imaging , whose biggest drawback is non - uniqueness when the snr is poor .      to circumvent the large uncertainty in the commonly used amplitude calibration of vlba observations of sgr  a * ,",
    "we have since 2001 developed a model fitting program in which the amplitude closure relation is applied to minimize the calibration errors and thus to improve the accuracy of the measurements @xcite .",
    "we then applied this procedure to refine the apparent size measurements of the first near - simultaneous vlba+y1 data @xcite observed at five wavelengths ( 6 , 3.6 , 2 , 1.35 cm , and 7 mm ) . by performing the weighted least - squares fits to these sizes at different wavelengths ,",
    "we conclude that the best - fit two - dimensional scattering structure is @xcite @xmath13 and @xmath14 with a position angle of 80@xmath15 . here ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are fwhm of major and minor axes in mas .",
    "this newly revised wavelength - dependent two - dimensional scattering structure is consistent with that from directly fitting to the closure amplitudes of somewhat different databases @xcite .",
    "compared with previous one ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , new scattering law shows an even smaller scattering angular size along the east - west major axis direction .      on november 3 , 2002",
    ", we successfully carried out the first vlba imaging observation of sgr  a * at its shortest wavelength of 3.5 mm @xcite .",
    "compared to the past 3.5 mm vlbi observations with the cmva @xcite , our vlba observation , with its dynamic scheduling , the highest possible recording rate and more frequent pointing calibration , has for the first time determined its elliptical structure in the radio emission at 3.5 mm , consistent with the morphology seen at longer wavelengths .",
    "it should be pointed out that dynamic observing is crucial to minimize the atmospheric effects in the mm - vlbi observation of sgr  a*. the exact observing date is not fixed , but depends on the weather condition at most antenna sites which usually are separated by a few thousand kilometers . while observing ,",
    "a frequent antenna pointing check observations of compact and strong sio maser sources , roughly in every 10 minutes , is necessary to maintain the best reference ( offset ) pointing and calibration .",
    "the best fitted apparent structure from november 2002 vlba observations is 0.21@xmath18 mas by 0.13@xmath19 mas with a position angle 79@xmath20 degrees .",
    "the major axis size is well determined while the fitted size of the minor axis has a quite big error mainly due to the poor resolution along the north - south direction . by subtracting in quadrature the scattering angle from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we obtain , for the first time , an intrinsic size of 0.126@xmath210.017 mas along the major axis at 3.5 mm . in september 2003 , we performed the second 3.5 mm vlba imaging observation of sgr  a * , which confirms the results in november 2002 ( shen et al .",
    "2006 in preparation ) .",
    "similarly , two 7 mm vlba+gbt ( green bank telescope ) observations with the highest recording rate were dynamically scheduled in march 2004 with the resultant averaged sizes of the major and minor axes of 0.724@xmath210.001 mas and 0.384@xmath210.013 mas , respectively with position angle 80.6@xmath22 degrees .",
    "the inclusion of gbt can improve the resolution in north - south direction by a factor of 3 @xcite , and actually this is the first vlbi observations to make use of the gbt at 7 mm .",
    "the results are consistent with the previous ones , but with much better accuracies . a significant deviation of measured size from the scattering angle along the major axis indicates an intrinsic size of 0.268@xmath210.010 mas for the major axis @xcite , consistent with the previously reported detection of intrinsic size at 7 mm @xcite .      on may 31 , 1999 , sgr",
    "a * was observed simultaneously at three 7 mm bands ( 39 , 43 and 45 ghz ) .",
    "it shows a larger deviation in the apparent source size from scattering angle than that observed a week ago on may 23 , 1999 @xcite .",
    "such a deviation is significant at about 3@xmath23 along the minor axis direction .",
    "thus , for the first time we can estimate an intrinsic size along the minor axis of 0.359@xmath210.095 mas .",
    "the derived intrinsic size for the major axis is 0.334@xmath210.042 mas .",
    "therefore , within the error bars , the intrinsic structure detected at 7 mm on may 31 , 1999 could be treated as a circular .",
    "compared with the previously detected major axis size of 0.268 mas , such an intrinsic structure has increased in its size by at least 25% at 7 mm .",
    "we have sampled a zone of the smbh closer to the event horizon than ever before , by detecting the intrinsic size of sgr  a * to be only 1 au , or 12.6 r@xmath24 .",
    "assuming an intrinsically spherical structure of sgr  a * and using the lower limit to the mass of sgr  a * of 4@xmath25 from the absolute proper motion work @xcite , we can easily derive a lower limit to the dark mass density of sgr  a * of 6.5@xmath310@xmath26 .",
    "this is the highest mass density ever measured in any smbh candidates , and thus strongly supports the smbh nature of sgr  a*.    it is intriguing that the detected intrinsic size at 3.5 mm is about twice the diameter of the shadow caused by the strong gravitational bending of light rays @xcite .",
    "regardless of the exact emission model , the characteristic diameter of shadow is always about 5r@xmath24 , which is nearly 50 @xmath5as for sgr  a*. so , sgr  a * will be the most important target for the future sub - mm vlbi experiment to test the general relativity in the strong field regime . such kind of shadow , if confirmed , would be the most direct evidence for the existence of smbh .",
    "the success of earlier single baseline 1.3 mm vlbi experiments @xcite has already demonstrated the feasibility of capturing an image of the shadow around the edge of sgr a * at sub - mm wavelengths in the near future .    from the two well determined intrinsic size at 7 @xcite and 3.5 mm @xcite , we can derive a @xmath27-dependence of the intrinsic size with @xmath28 using the two - point fit .",
    "this intrinsic size versus wavelength relation is consistent with the two lower limits of 0.02 and 0.008 mas at 1.3 and 0.8 mm , respectively , from the absence of refractive scintillation @xcite .",
    "such a wavelength dependence of the intrinsic major axis size provides a strong constraint on emission and accretion models for sgr a*. it explicitly rules out explanations other than those models with stratified structure .",
    "it has been shown that the radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) model , after taking into account the interstellar scattering , can predict the observed sizes at both 7 and 3.5 mm quite well @xcite .",
    "the extrapolated size of emitting region at 1 mm will reach the last stable orbit ( lso ) radius of 3r@xmath24 for a non - rotating smbh . for a rotating smbh , the radius of lso could be only 0.5r@xmath24 . therefore , a break in the wavelength - dependent intrinsic size is inevitable with the decreasing wavelength , which can be used to constrain the spin of smbh .    the radio flux density of sgr  a * is known to be variable at all the observable wavelengths on time scales of days to months .",
    "the variability appears to be more pronounced at shorter wavelengths with a relatively large amplitude fluctuation .",
    "for example , an intra - day variability ( idv ) in the 2 mm flux density of sgr  a * has been found by the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) observations , indicating a very compact emitting region @xcite .",
    "the correlation between flux density at 7 mm and spectral index suggests that the variation at the short radio wavelengths is intrinsic rather than due to the interstellar scintillation @xcite . as such",
    ", it seems inevitable that the variability in the radio flux density of sgr  a * would be accompanied by the structural change .",
    "our simulation seems to suggest that the detected structural variability on may 31 , 1999 could be related to an outburst / flare occurred at about 50r@xmath24 from the central smbh ( shen et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we have revised the scattering law , which gives a smaller scattering size along the east - west major axis direction . with the dynamic scheduling",
    ", we successfully carried out two 3.5 mm vlba imaging observations , which reveal a consistent east - west elongated apparent structure .",
    "we also performed two - epoch new 7 mm vlba+gbt observations with a better sensitivity and resolution .",
    "these new data show that the intrinsic size has come to play with the scattering effect at both 3.5 and 7 mm .",
    "the inferred intrinsic size is about 1 and 2.1 au at 3.5 and 7 mm , respectively .",
    "the derived extraordinarily high ( dark ) mass density of sgr  a * strongly argues that sgr  a * is indeed a super - massive black hole .",
