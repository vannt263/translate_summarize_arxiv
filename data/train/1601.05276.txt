    "quantum transport of graphene - based nanostructures has attracted much of interest due to potential applications @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting features of graphene originates from the possibility of engineering the structural and electronic properties of graphene @xcite . in this regard , although in pristine graphene , the strength of spin - orbit coupling is weak , but the possibility of enhancing the strength of spin - orbit coupling in graphene layer has recently attracted a great interest from theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite viewpoints .",
    "it has been shown that spin - orbit coupling in graphene can be increased , giving rise to the so - called spin hall effect @xcite at zero external magnetic fields at room temperature .",
    "this opens up new opportunity to manipulate charge- and spin - related phenomena efficiently same as manipulation of pseudospin @xcite and valley @xcite degrees of freedom for carbon - based electronics applications @xcite .",
    "basically , the spin - orbit coupling in graphene can be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic origins @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling comes from carbon intra - atomic spin - orbit coupling and it can be raised up to 17mev by proximity effect between monolayer graphene and few - layers semiconducting tungsten disulfide @xcite .",
    "the extrinsic spin - orbit coupling , which is known as rashba spin - orbit ( rso ) , can be induced through breaking the inversion symmetry of the lattice structure .",
    "a giant rashba splitting has been observed as large as 100 @xmath0 through au intercalation at the graphene @xmath1 ni interface @xcite . in realistic cases , when rso coupling induces in a specific region of a sample through external sources such as gate configuration @xcite , substrate @xcite or adatoms @xcite , the strength of rso coupling may not change abruptly at the region s boundaries , and its strength modulates spatially from full value to the zero @xcite , due to the leakage of the source outside the region .",
    "transport properties under modulated potential @xcite and energy gap @xcite in graphene layer have been considered , but the role of spatially varying rso coupling on the transport properties of graphene still lacks a clear understanding @xcite . while most of the studies of transport properties from rso region focus on abrupt change of strength of spin - orbit coupling at the borders @xcite , in this paper , we will address the effects of variation of rso coupling with a constant strength gradient within its border regions on the transmission probability , the conductance and the fano factor of graphene .",
    "we find that the magnitude and the angular dependence of the transmission probabilities depend strongly on the border thickness .",
    "in addition , it is shown that if the border thickness is finite , its effect on the conductance is not only to reduce the oscillations amplitude but also to enhance the conductance magnitude .",
    "also , depending on the values of border thickness , the fano factor of the system can be controlled fundamentally .",
    "we consider a monolayer graphene in the @xmath2 plane with an inhomogeneous rso region between two normal regions .",
    "the interfaces of the regions are perpendicular to the @xmath3 direction as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ soschem](a ) .",
    "the inhomogeneous rso region is comprised of border regions that are close to the normal regions , characterizing by linearly varying strength of rso coupling of thickness @xmath4 and the central region with thickness @xmath5 over which rso strength is constant ( see fig . [ soschem](b ) ) .",
    "so the spatial profile of rso strength throughout the spin - orbit region , 0 @xmath6 2@xmath4 + @xmath5 , can be modeled as , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the height of rso strength .",
    "the spatial variation of rso coupling is assumed to be small on the scale of the graphene s lattice constant ( a = 0.246 @xmath9 ) . in this semiclassical approach",
    ", the long - wavelength components of hamiltonian will be valid , subsequently , states near the valley k@xmath10 and those near k@xmath1 can be considered as two separate valleys in constructing the continuum approximation of hamiltonian .",
    "also , due to the absence of inter - valley scattering processes , we adopt single valley picture .    within the continuum limit",
    ", the hamiltonian describing the total system reads as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fermi velocity , the pauli s matrices @xmath13 and @xmath14 act on the pseudospin ( sublattice ) and spin spaces , respectively . also , @xmath15 is the heaviside step function and @xmath16 is the identity matrix .    note that in conventional rashba systems , rashba hamiltonian is momentum - dependent @xcite , subsequently , in the case of non - uniform rashba coupling , there will be terms in the hamiltonian containing derivatives of the rashba coupling in order to ensure hermiticity of the rashba operator @xcite .",
    "but in the case of graphene due to triangular symmetry , by expanding rashba hamiltonian around dirac points ( low - energy expansion ) , the lowest order of expansion is momentum - independent @xcite which is in contrast to the conventional systems .",
    "however , if we retain higher order terms in the expansion which are momentum - dependent @xcite , the contribution of terms including derivatives of rashba coupling is negligible , because in our analysis we have made the assumption that the strength of spin - orbit coupling changes linearly and smoothly .    for the numerical implementation ,",
    "it is convenient to consider rso region as a sequence of slices perpendicular to the direction of transport with nearly constant strength in each slice . by solving eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonain ] ) in the @xmath17th slice of rso region , one can determine the eigenvalues as @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents upper ( lower ) subband in the @xmath20 conduction ( valance ) band , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the @xmath3 ( @xmath23 ) component of wave vector which will be specified below and @xmath24 is rso strength in the @xmath17th slice . also , the corresponding eigenvectors are given by , @xmath25 where @xmath26 = 1 ( -1 ) indicates the right - moving ( left - moving ) carrier .",
    "in the left and right normal regions , eqs .",
    "( [ eigenenergies ] ) and ( [ eigenvectors ] ) reduce , respectively , as @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 .    in the calculation ,",
    "an incident carrier is supposed to be injected from the left to the right upon incidence angle @xmath30 . due to particle - hole symmetry in the system , without loss of generality , we focus on the conduction band states , @xmath31 , and choose a positive value for the carrier energy ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "translational invariance in the @xmath23 direction implies that the @xmath23 component of the wave vector is a good quantum number , which it can be written in terms of the incidence angle @xmath30 as @xmath33 but the @xmath3 component of wave vector depends on the region under consideration . using eqs .",
    "( [ eigenenergies ] ) , ( [ neigenenergies ] ) and ( [ eq : q ] ) , the @xmath3 component of wave vector can be obtained as    @xmath34    for the normal regions , and @xmath35 for the @xmath17th slice of the rso region . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) , it is easy to see that for @xmath36 and @xmath32 , @xmath37 has pure real values , consequently , we have traveling modes . but for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath37 becomes pure imaginary and the wave is evanescent , whereas for @xmath38 and @xmath40 the wave is a traveling mode@xcite .    upon substituting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kn ] ) and ( [ eq : q ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ neigenvectors ] ) , one can use eq .",
    "( [ neigenvectors ] ) to write the general wave functions which are valid in the left and right normal regions as , @xmath41 where the coefficient @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) represents the transmission ( reflection ) amplitude from incident subband @xmath44 into subband @xmath26 . also , with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) , ( [ eq : q ] ) and ( [ eigenvectors ] ) , the total wave function in the @xmath17th slice of rso region can be expressed as , @xmath45 where the coefficients @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the scattering amplitudes from subband @xmath44 into subband @xmath26 .    using the transfer - matrix method @xcite , transmission amplitude in the left normal region , @xmath42 , can be determined .",
    "then transmission probability @xmath48 can be evaluated by @xmath48 = @xmath49 .",
    "it should be noted that since the rso interaction does not couple the states of spin - chiral carriers with opposite subband indices , so transmission probabilities through different subbands vanish , i.e. , @xmath50 = 0 and @xmath51 = 0 @xcite .",
    "having obtained transmission probabilities , the conductance of carriers at zero temperature in subband n can be obtained by @xcite , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the width of system , @xmath55 is the electron charge , and @xmath56 is the fermi energy .    finally , we investigate the subband fano factor of this system which can be given as follows @xcite , @xmath57",
    "throughout this paper , the value of @xmath8 is fixed to be 10 @xmath0 and @xmath5 = 100 @xmath9 . in the numerical calculations",
    ", we have chosen the thickness of each slice 1@xmath9 .",
    "it should be noted that we have examined larger slice thickness and same qualitative results were found .",
    "figures [ tuu](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) represent the angular dependence of the transmission probability @xmath58 through rso region for different values of border thickness , @xmath4 = 0 , 25 , 50 , 75 , and 100 @xmath9 .",
    "the incident energy in panel ( a ) is @xmath59 = 2 @xmath0 and in panel ( b ) is @xmath59 = 16 @xmath0 . in both of these panels , we can see that the magnitude of @xmath58 increases with increasing the border thickness with a maximum at @xmath30 = 0 but at large value of @xmath4 the maximum value of @xmath58 in panel ( b ) is larger than that of panel ( a ) .",
    "panel ( c ) refers to the case @xmath59 = 40 @xmath0 and illustrates that the angles at which transmission maxima occur depend on the border thickness . for large @xmath4",
    "the transmission is close to unity at low angles , while for small @xmath4 perfect transmission takes place at @xmath60 .    in fig .",
    "[ tdd ] the transmission probability @xmath61 as a function of the incidence angle with the same parameters used for fig .",
    "[ tuu ] is shown .",
    "figure [ tdd](a ) displays an increasing behavior of the @xmath61 in terms of @xmath4 which is similar to what is also observed for the @xmath58 at low energies ( see also fig . [ tuu](a ) ) .",
    "but for energies @xmath59 = 16 @xmath0 and @xmath59 = 40 @xmath0 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tdd](b ) and ( c ) , the @xmath61 is close to unity in a considerable range of incidence angles about the @xmath62 .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ tdd](b ) the transmission angles of the @xmath61 decrease slightly by increasing the @xmath4 .",
    "hence the different behaviors observed for the transmission probabilities with respect to the border thickness , depend on the value of the incident energy .",
    "these features will have direct influences on the conductance properties which are investigated below .    in fig .",
    "[ gud ] , the conductance of conduction subbands is presented as a function of the fermi energy for different values of the border thickness , @xmath4 = 0 , 25 , 50 , 75 , and 100 @xmath9 .",
    "the conductance of the upper subband , @xmath63 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ gud ] ( a ) .",
    "we can see that the @xmath63 increases with increasing the border thickness , @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , this increase has not same value across the range of energies . for energies between 0 and @xmath64 in which carrier transmission",
    "can be occurred through evanescent modes , there exists a considerable enhancement in @xmath63 versus @xmath4 .",
    "this indicates that , in contrast to the abrupt border case ( @xmath4 = 0 ) , the role of evanescent modes on transport features is less dominant when the border of rso region is a smoothly varying function .",
    "in addition , for @xmath65 , a small enhancement can be observed in the @xmath63 corresponding to the large @xmath4 , since , in this energy range scattering from spin - orbit interaction has no fundamental role .",
    "figure [ gud](b ) shows the conductance of lower conduction subband , @xmath66 . for @xmath4 = 0 , @xmath66 increases and",
    "tends to the @xmath67 in a damped oscillatory behavior as a function of the fermi energy . at low energies , increasing the border thickness causes an increase in the @xmath66 . for intermediate fermi energies , the modulations of @xmath66 reduce with an increasing the @xmath4 which this behavior is described below . also , the values of @xmath66 are insensitive to the border thickness and take the maximal value @xmath67 in the limit @xmath68 . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath66 increases monotonically as a function of the fermi energy at sufficiently large @xmath4 .",
    "note that due to transmission of carrier via a traveling wave in the lower subband , the @xmath66 is often close to the @xmath67 .",
    "the total conductance which is the sum of the conductances of the subbands , @xmath69 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ gtp](a ) .",
    "it increases versus fermi energy because there always exist more traveling states at high energies .",
    "in addition , there are conductance oscillations which can be related to the interference between left - moving and right - moving states in the rso region . with increasing @xmath4 , @xmath70 not only increases but also displays damped oscillations",
    ". remarkably , for large enough values of @xmath4 the oscillating behavior of conductance greatly reduces .",
    "this happens because when passing the carriers through the borders , they do not feel abrupt changes in dispersion relation due to smoothly varying spin - orbit coupling .",
    "therefore reflection from the interfaces between the central and the normal regions decreases in comparison with abrupt border case and consequently the modulations of amplitude reduce .    also , in fig .",
    "[ gtp](b ) , the subband polarization of the conductance @xmath71 versus fermi energy is presented .",
    "we can see that there is a minima in the range @xmath72 .",
    "this indicates that in this energy range most of the carriers can be transmitted through the subband @xmath73 .",
    "as we increase @xmath4 the polarization decreases in absolute value .",
    "it should be note that for @xmath4 = 0 all of the results presented in figs .",
    "[ gud ] and [ gtp ] ( shown with thin solid black line ) are consistent with figs . 4 and 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us now investigate the fano factor of the system providing insight into the internal kinetic rates . for the sake of clarity , the fano factors of upper subband , @xmath74 , and lower subband , @xmath75 , are calculated separately which are shown in figs . [ fano](a ) and ( b ) , respectively . at low energies",
    ", we observe that in both cases the effect of border thickness is to decrease the values of the fano factors in particular for the @xmath74 .",
    "similar to the conductance behavior [ figs .",
    "[ gtp](a ) and ( b ) ] , for intermediate energies , damped oscillatory behaviors of @xmath76 are reduced by increasing @xmath4 .",
    "also , for @xmath77 , transport characteristic turns into the ballistic regime ( @xmath76 = 0 ) .",
    "since at low energies spin - orbit scattering plays a dominant role , we focus on investigating the evolution of both the fano factors ( @xmath76 ) versus @xmath4 near the dirac point . in fig .",
    "[ fanob ] , this evolution is shown for @xmath56 = 2 @xmath0 .",
    "we see that both the fano factors are monotonically decreasing function of the fermi energy and tend to @xmath76 @xmath78 0.1 for large enough values of @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that , in addition to the fermi energy , the border thickness can influence on transport features in a fundamental way .",
    "in conclusion , we studied transport properties through inhomogeneous rso region in graphene .",
    "we investigated transmission probabilities in terms of border thickness , fermi energy and incidence angle .",
    "also , in the analysis of the conductance as a function of the fermi energy , we identified that the main influence of border thickness of rso region is the smearing out of the conductance oscillations and at the same time the making an enhancement of conductance magnitude .",
    "also , the effect of border thickness is to reduce the magnitude and oscillations amplitude of both fano factors of upper and lower subbands .",
    "further , we analyzed the low energy behaviors of the fano factors for different subbands in a wide range of border thicknesses ranging from small thickness at which transmission takes place via tunneling effect , to a large one at which transport is nearly ballistic .",
