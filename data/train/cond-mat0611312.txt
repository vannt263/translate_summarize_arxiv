    "when height of the lattice potential is low , the bec have coherency over all lattice sites . however , when height of the lattice potential increases so that nearest neighbor site hopping becomes difficult for atoms and then coherence of the bec is destroyed .",
    "the atomic condensate placed in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) optical lattice can be best described by the bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the bose - hubbard model has been realized and quantum phase transition from weakly interacting bose superfluid to a strongly interacting mott insulator state was indeed observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "similar quantum phase transition was also observed when a 3d bec was placed in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the insulator phase in the 1d lattice is called a squeezed state . kramer _ et al . _ @xcite have found the mass renormalization in presence of the optical potential .",
    "the renormalization decreases the value of the axial excitation frequencies which have been verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "there are several theoretical calculations for dynamic structure factor of quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose gas placed in 1d optical lattices @xcite .",

    "a stack of weakly coupled quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) condensates can be created by applying a relatively strong 1d optical lattices to an ordinary 3d cigar shaped condensate .",
    "the finite transverse size of the condensates produces a discreteness of radial spectrum . the short wavelength axial phonons with different number of discrete radial modes of a cigar shaped condensates placed in optical lattices give rise to multi - branch bogoliubov - bloch spectrum ( mbbs ) @xcite .",
    "this is similar to multibranch bogoliubov spectrum ( mbs ) of a cigar shaped bec @xcite .",
