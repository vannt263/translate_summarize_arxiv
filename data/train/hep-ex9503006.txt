    "ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) counters are powerful tools for achieving particle identification over a wide range of momentum within a single detector .",
    "the experience of the sld@xcite and delphi@xcite collaborations in developing broad - range detectors has shown that @xmath4/k / p separation can be achieved up to approximately 30 gev/@xmath2 and e/@xmath4 separation can be performed up to 6 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "there is also the capability of handling modest multiplicities within the detector . for reviews on the subject ,",

    "the frequency distribution of radiation , @xmath5 , is constant for all frequencies , @xmath6 , leading to several possible photon detection schemes .",
    "existing rich counters generally detect the photons in the uv region ( 6.5  7.5ev ) by means of photoionization of a complex organic molecule , such as tmae or tea , in a gas chamber .",
    "alternatively , a segmented optical readout based on an array of photomultipliers offers four main advantages over the gas - based chamber :    1 .   no special handling for hazardous materials , such as gaseous photocathodes .",
    "no need for the high purity uv - transparent materials called for when detecting photons of energy greater than 6 ev ( @xmath7 nm ) , such as is the case for gaseous photocathodes as well as csi photocathodes .",
    "3 .   greater overall integrated efficiency due to the wide bandwidth ( 2.54.3 ev ) of the photocathodes used in pmt s .",
    "4 .   the possibility of readout fast enough for first - level triggering of the host experiment .    for these reasons , the proposed brahms experiment@xcite at rhic plans to use such a rich counter to perform the high momentum particle identification for a forward - angle ( @xmath8 ) spectrometer .",
    "this counter is designed to identify pions in the momentum range from 4 to 20 gev/@xmath2 , kaons from 9 to 20 gev/@xmath2 , and protons from 17 to 35 gev/@xmath2 . to obtain the high index of refraction necessary for the required coverage ( @xmath9=1.00185 ) , a radiator of gaseous perfluorobutane ( ) at 1.25 atm .",
    "absolute pressure has been selected . for photon detection ,",
    "the brahms design calls for four 100-anode pmt s forming a two - by - two array , each with an active area of 10@xmath010 @xmath1 , as described below .",
    "although arrays of single - anode pmts@xcite , as well as an image intensifier coupled to a ccd readout@xcite , have been used successfully in previous rich counters , state - of - the - art large - area multi - anode pmt s offer the advantage of many channels with a single common power supply and a fast , compact readout . for more details concerning the brahms rich",

    "2 .   use of a large - area ( 10@xmath010 @xmath1 ) segmented multi - anode pmt for fast imaging of the various ring patterns .",
    "an off - axis displacement of the focal plane , obtained by a rotation of the focussing mirror , such that the focal plane detector is situated outside the radiator volume illuminated by the particle flux",
    ".    some pertinent results of these tests ( rhic r.  & d.  project 44 ) are reported here .",
    "note that the multi - anode pmt used in these measurements was the first product of a new design by the hamamatsu corporation@xcite .",
    "the expected performance criteria outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , based upon hamamatsu s specifications , are largely borne out by the present results .",
    "the hamamatsu r-4549 - 01 is a 20-stage 100-anode pmt based on a fine - mesh dynode structure , providing a current gain of @xmath10 at a high voltage of hv = -2000 volts . in this model a special grid of focusing electrodes has been installed between the photocathode and the first dynode which is designed to improve the spatial resolution and uniformity as seen in the individual anode signals ( i.e. , pixel response ) .",
    "the 10@xmath010 @xmath1 photocathode is bialkali ; the segmented anode is a matrix array ( 10@xmath010 = 100 ) of 9.5@xmath09.5 mm@xmath11 units with lemo outputs .",
    "( the outer glass envelope of the pmt measures 12.8@xmath012.8 @xmath1 . ) with current gains from @xmath12 to @xmath13 ( hv = -1800 to -2500 volts ) the outputs will easily drive cable connections to appropriate adc s .",
    "the high voltage is supplied by a single high - voltage cable : a built - in r / c dropping chain fixes the relative dynode voltages .",
    "a single output from the last dynode , representing essentially the `` sum '' of all anode currents , is available as a convenient trigger .",
    "the entrance window is of boro - silicate glass with the typical cutoff for wavelengths @xmath14 nm ( @xmath15 ev ) .",
    "the quantum efficiency response function is approximately gaussian , with a peak sensitivity of 18% , centered at @xmath16 ev and with fwhm = 1.8 ev .",
    "( the tails , however , fall off twice as fast as a true gaussian . )",
    "the integral of the pmt quantum efficiency , @xmath17 , over the photon energy , @xmath18 , is @xmath19 ev . the efficiency was found to be fairly uniform over the central region of the pmt face , with a fall - off of 30 - 50% at the edges and corners , respectively .",
    "since the erenkov ring - image is composed of multiple hits of single photons , we were prompted to study the single - hit response . for this purpose ,",
    "the r-4549 pmt was first mounted in a light - tight box .",
    "a photon source was made by collimating the light from a blue led .",
    "the collimator opening was positioned a few millimeters away from the photocathode , and was such as to illuminate only a single pixel at a time .",
    "the led was pulsed by a driver whose intensity could be tuned low enough so that the collimator output was either 0 or 1 photon .",
    "( this tuning requirement was checked independently using an rca 8854 pmt with excellent single - photon resolution . )",
    "the data acquisition was triggered by the same signal which triggered the led .",
    "figure [ fig : one_pe]a shows the adc pulse height distribution for a typical pixel .",
    "this distribution is exponential in shape with no distinct separation of the pedestal from a one - photoelectron peak .",
    "by contrast , the adc distribution for the rca tube , shown in fig .  [ fig : one_pe]b , shows such a separation .",
    "the position dependence of the response is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : led_scan ] . the relative pulse height in each of three adjacent pixels",
    "is plotted for a run in which the position of the led relative to the phototube was stepped in the @xmath20-direction .",
    "( to improve the signal , the voltage driving the led was raised so as to produce many photoelectrons . )",
    "the fwhm of the response for an individual pixel is 10 mm with little cross - talk between neighboring pixels , as expected .",
    "the pulse heights in neighboring pixels average only about 10% of that in the hit pixel for a hit in the center .",
    "the prototype rich counter is shown schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : testbox ] .",
    "it was constructed from 1.9 cm thick aluminum plate , vacuum - welded at the box edges , with a removable top attached by 50 1/4 - 20 screws and sealed by a rubber gasket .",

    "the particle beam enters via a 15 cm diameter mylar window of thickness 0.025 cm ( shown on the left in the figure ) and exits through an identical window at the output port .",
    "a 15 cm diameter concave glass mirror@xcite whose front surface has been aluminized with a protective mgf@xmath22 coating and which has a focal length @xmath23 = 91.4 cm is situated at a distance of @xmath24 = 114.3 cm from the beam entrance .",
    "this mirror is rotated by an angle @xmath25 = 8@xmath26 relative to the beam direction , producing a ring image focussed at 2@xmath25 = 16@xmath26 .",
    "the reflectivity of the mirror is approximately 8090% at visible wavelengths .",
    "the mirror is mounted in a frame attached to an axle which can be rotated about a vertical axis perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "the mirror angle is controlled by a 0.6 cm steel rod which moves a 47 cm arm rigidly fixed to the mirror frame , so as to allow a mirror rotation over the range @xmath27 .",
    "due to practical space constraints , the position of the front face of the phototube was at a distance of 84.5 cm from the center of the mirror , causing images on the photodetector to be very slightly out of focus . in fitting experimental ring patterns we adopted an effective focal length reduced by 3% from the true focal length to account for the displacement from the focal plane .",
    "one hundred six lemo signal cables are fed into the box using ordinary lemo feed - throughs epoxyed into place to maintain a vacuum seal .",
    "the output signal from each of the pmt anodes is fed into an input channel of a lecroy 1882 fastbus adc for readout of the pulse height .",
    "the device was aligned in the secondary test beam at the ags , with the trigger defined by a 2@xmath02 @xmath1 scintillator , s1 , just before the entrance window of the test vessel , and a larger scintillator paddle , s2 , downstream of the exit window .",
    "the initial alignment was accomplished using a laser placed on the known beam axis ; the mirror and detector angles were then set and checked visually .",
    "two identical drift chambers , one 57 cm in front of and one 79 cm behind the prototype counter , provided tracking for determining the particle trajectory .",
    "these two chambers are part of a set of four wire chambers built for the tracking system of bnl experiment 878 and used during the 1991 and 1992 heavy ion runs .",
    "each chamber consists of six planes with wires oriented in three sets of directions . for each wire orientation",
    "an offset of half a cell size provides the information necessary to resolve the left - right ambiguity present in these wire detectors .",
    "the position resolution for each plane of the drift chambers has been measured as being 150 @xmath28 m .",
    "thus , the expected position of the center of each rich ring on the phototube is determined to a resolution of approximately 500 @xmath28 m in both the @xmath29 and @xmath20 directions .",
    "( perfluorobutane ) is a colorless , odorless , non - flamable gas which is essentially inert . in other respects ,",
    "save for flamability , it resembles its hydrocarbon counterpart , butane .",
    "the most abundant form resulting from commercial production is the n - isomer , a completely fluorinated linear carbon chain .",
    "table [ table : gases ] presents a comparison of key properties for this and other radiator gases used in the results presented here .",
    "the optical transmission of a sample of the gas used in the measurements reported here was recorded with a uv spectrometer , and it was found that the transmission of this gas is nearly 100% at wavelengths of 230 - 450 nm .",
    "the delphi collaboration reports@xcite complete transparency of pure at shorter wavelengths down to 160 nm .",
    "the gas - handling system used in filling the rich chamber with fluorocarbons is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rich_gas ] .",
    "the procedure adopted utilizes the fact that the radiator gases freon-12 ( 122 ) and c@xmath30f@xmath31 ( 238 ) have molecular weights ( given in parentheses ) much heavier than air ( 29 ) or argon ( 40 ) .",
    "for example , consider the case where the rich chamber has been initially filled with argon .",
    "the c@xmath30f@xmath31 , which is supplied by pcr , inc.@xcite , is set to flow slowly into the bottom of the vessel , while the output mixture ( ar + c@xmath30f@xmath31 ) is sent through a cooled recovery tank where the c@xmath30f@xmath31 is liquified while the argon passes out through the exhaust .",
    "the differing ( by a factor of 6 ) molecular weights result in a density gradient in the rich vessel , such that if the flow is slow enough ( non - turbulent ) the volume slowly becomes enriched in c@xmath30f@xmath31 .",
    "the procedure can be continued until the supply in tank a is exhausted . in our case",
    "we manually switched the two tanks a and b and repeated the cycle using the c@xmath30f@xmath31 previously recovered in b. three such cycles yielded a gas mix of approximately 90% purity in c@xmath30f@xmath31 .    in order to recover the c@xmath30f@xmath31 at the conclusion of the experiment ,",
    "a pump was used to reverse the flow direction , as indicated by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : rich_gas ] . as the c@xmath30f@xmath31 is recovered into b , the observed pressure drop in the chamber",
    "is compensated by adding argon to maintain a pressure differential of @xmath32 0.15 atm .    in principle",
    ", one can install a remote - controlled switching system to actuate the controlling valves , so as to alternate the designated function of the supply and recovery tanks .",
    "this would allow an extended period of automatic cycling , leading to a nearly 100% purity of c@xmath30f@xmath31 , or by reversing the cycle , a complete recovery of the fluorocarbon .",
    "figure [ fig : freon_data ] presents results measured with the beam tuned for negative 12 gev/@xmath2 particles  predominantly pions  and a gas mixture in the test box of freon-12 and n@xmath22 .",
    "the squares plotted in panel ( a ) are proportional in size to the pulse height for each phototube pixel , summed over approximately 1100 events .",
    "the drawn ring is the best fit of the data to a circle .",
    "figure [ fig : freon_data]b is a histogram of the adc pulse height in pixel ( 3,8 ) , which lies directly on the ring .",

    "the corresponding histogram from neighboring pixel ( 3,9 ) , which is not on the ring , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : freon_data]c ; clearly the cross - talk between adjacent pixels is small , although not completely negligible .",
    "the ability of the counter to identify individual particles is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rich_3gev ] . panels a , b and c show individual events from a run where the beam momentum was tuned to 3 gev/@xmath2 and the box contained a c@xmath30f@xmath31-ar mixture .",

    "[ fig : rich_3gev]d where three distinct peaks , identified with @xmath33 , @xmath34 and e@xmath35 , are clearly observed .",
    "the peaks are well described as gaussian in shape ; for the rings which are fully saturated in radius ( electrons ) the resolution of the radius determination is @xmath3 .",
    "the fitting procedure extracted the ring radius by means of the adc - weighted average of the distances from pixel centers to the ring center given by the tracking .",
    "exhaustive simulations of this ring - fitting algorithm show negligible bias for rings of radius from 2.0 to 4.2 cm , and predict a resolution of approximately half of that actually achieved .",
    "the remaining contribution to the measured resolution can be attributed to chromatic and geometric aberrations ( see discussion in ref .",
    "a momentum scan was performed with a c@xmath30f@xmath31-ar mixture in the vessel during a period in which the mixing proportion of the two gases was held fixed .",
    "the ring radius is plotted versus momentum in fig .",
    "[ fig : momentum_scan ] , which shows saturated light production from electrons , as well as the excitation curves for muons , pions and kaons .",
    "the saturated radius for electrons implies an index of refraction @xmath9=1.00113 , shown as the horizontal line through the electron points .",
    "the excitation curves predicted by this index of refraction are shown as the solid curves ; the shaded regions represent a @xmath365% systematic uncertainty in the absolute momentum scale .",
    "the measured values of the radius all lie within the shaded regions , giving confidence that the particle identification is correct . from @xmath9=1.00113",
    "it is inferred that the fraction of c@xmath30f@xmath31 in the vessel was approximately 75% .",
    "later runs following further filling of the vessel achieved approximately 90% c@xmath30f@xmath31 .",
    "the difficulty in determining the photoelectron yield precisely can be understood from examination of the single - pixel response functions illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : freon_data]b and c. the wire - mesh dynode structure of the h-4549 pmt does not provide the typical gaussian response function which would allow one to distinguish 1 , 2 or 3 photoelectron hits .",
    "rather , the exponential shape of the response function makes it difficult to determine for a given event the number of hits on an individual pixel .",
    "the yield was instead deduced from the distribution of the anode adc sum ( pedestal and gain corrected ) per event . for the case of the -ar mix mentioned in the previous section and 12 gev/@xmath2 pions",
    ", the adc sum distribution perfectly describes a gaussian curve whose mean is 699 and r.m.s .",
    "width is 185 ; hence the number of photoelectrons is ( 699/185)@xmath11=14.3 , and the figure of merit is approximately 60 @xmath37 . although this value is somewhat lower than the expected value of 90 @xmath37 , as based on the manufacturer s specifications for the mirror and pmt , it suffices for the design criteria of brahms@xcite .",
    "all three key elements of the brahms rich counter , namely the use of gas , the use of the large area multi - anode pmt , and the off - axis displacement of the focal plane , were successfully tested together .",
    "particle identification was possible on an event - by - event basis by determining the erenkov ring radius to a resolution of @xmath3 , which is quite close to the design value in ref .",
    "improvement in the systematic understanding of the ring radius versus momentum curves ( see fig .  [",
