    "superstring theory @xcite compactified down to physical four space - time dimensions is generally accepted as the description of curved backgrounds as non - vanishing expectation values of massless string excitations in a language which reproduces einstein s general relativity .",
    "however it is not _ a priori _ clear in which frame such a description should be better formulated , since there are several frameworks possible .",
    "specifically , upon compactification of extra dimensions and nearly independently of both the content of the starting theory and the compactification scheme , one expects to obtain a low - energy , tree - level , effective 4-dimensional action @xmath0 for the evolution of the uncompactified degrees of freedom of the string , which is in the form of a conformally invariant non - linear @xmath1-model .",
    "a spin 2 gravitational field @xmath2 ( latin indices run from 0 to 3 ) and an antisymmetric field @xmath3 which couple respectively to the string vertex operators for their own emission ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) , emerge in a natural way in @xmath0 @xmath4 \\ , \\label{s}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the string length , @xmath6 the world - sheet metric tensor , @xmath7 the levi - civita symbol in two dimensions and ellipses stand for fermionic terms as well as gauge fields and other moduli .",
    "of course were one able to perform the derivation completely , the background expectation values of the various fields could be fully determined from the action of the fundamental theory from which one has started .",
    "this purely descriptive picture is hard to perform in general , if possible at all .",
    "the most serious obstacle to obtaining such a picture is that there are at present no models which describe compactification as a dynamical process taking place in the higher dimensional space of ( super)string theory and leading to an evolution towards the present state of the universe as the preferred vacuum ( for a review of early attempts see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "thus one is naturally led to seek other ways of solving for the fields .",
    "a possible guide is the requirement of conformal invariance on the world - sheet for a generalized @xmath8-dimensional @xmath1-model which furnishes us a complete set of renormalization equations .",
    "further , it turns out that in the latter set one has also to include the scalar excitation @xmath9 ( the dilaton ) which couples to the world - sheet scalar curvature @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned equations , supplemented with suitable boundary conditions , are sufficient to determine the background fields without making any further reference to string theory .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the same equations can also be obtained by varying an effective action which , for the particular case of @xmath10 and non zero maxwell strength tensor of electrodynamics @xmath11 , can be written ( see @xcite , but we work in four space - time dimensions ) @xmath12 \\ , \\label{s_s}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the scalar curvature of the metric @xmath2 , @xmath14 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and @xmath15 is the dilaton coupling constant with the dilaton assumed to remain massless @xcite .",
    "this is the effective action which describes the background fields of the selected string vacuum in the so called _ string frame _ ( sf ) .",
    "the name is justified by the fact that the uncompactified degrees of freedom of the string move along a geodesic of the metric @xmath2 as can be inferred from ( [ s ] ) .",
    "the equations of motion following from ( [ s_s ] ) can be written as ( we omit the subscript @xmath16 and set @xmath17 ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the metric @xmath2 and the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor is given as @xmath20    the effective action and equations of motion can be further modified by applying the following conformal transformation @xmath21 where the constant @xmath22 can be taken to be the average value of the dilaton in the present universe . since in these notes",
    "we consider only asymptotically flat cases , we will assume @xmath23 in the forthcoming sections .",
    "we further define the planck length as @xmath24 thus obtaining the action in the _ einstein frame _ ( ef ) , @xmath25 \\ , \\label{s_e}\\ ] ] in which we point out that space - time coordinates have been left unchanged and @xmath26 is the curvature related to @xmath27 .",
    "the new equations of motion are obtained by applying the same mapping to the previous ones given in ( [ eq_s ] ) ( again we omit the subscript @xmath28 and set @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 where @xmath19 is now the covariant derivative with respect to the metric @xmath27 .",

    "which frame is more suitable as a description of the present state of our universe is an open question which will eventually be settled by experiment @xcite .",
    "the issue raised in the present notes has already been extensively discussed in the framework of scalar - tensor theories of gravity and observable consequences have been deduced mainly in cosmology . because of the direct coupling between the dilaton and matter ( in our case the electromagnetic field ) , both actions in eqs .",
    "( [ s_s ] ) and ( [ s_e ] ) fail to be of the brans - dicke type , thus the equivalence principle does not hold in general . specifically , one expects the equivalence principle to be violated whenever the gradient of the dilaton field is not negligible . however , such violations might be allowable provided they occurred far in the past , _",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , from ( [ phi_rnd ] ) one sees that the dilaton gradient falls off and becomes negligible sufficiently far away from @xmath50 . to be more specific , since @xmath51 , one can write the total force acting on a test mass @xmath52 as the sum of the force @xmath53 due to the spatial dependence of @xmath54 and the newtonian contribution @xmath55 , @xmath56 and finds that @xmath53 becomes of the same order as @xmath55 at @xmath57 this implies that , if one can perform a measurement with the precision of one part over @xmath58 , one has to go closer than @xmath59 to the black hole centre in order to test any violation of the equivalence principle .",
    "further , @xmath60 must lie outside @xmath61 and this gives an estimate for the smallest charge - to - mass ratio that the black hole must posses in order that any deviation can be tested , namely @xmath62 for a solar mass black hole and @xmath63 this means a charge of about @xmath64 electron charges or @xmath65 c. on the other hand , for a planck mass black hole with one electron charge the ratio @xmath66 and one only needs a precision of @xmath67 .    upon transforming to sf",
