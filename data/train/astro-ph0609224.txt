    "sy equ ( hd 203664 ) is the early - b spectral type star , b0.5iiin , classified as the @xmath1 cephei variable by @xcite from the hipparcos photometry .",
    "the star is one of the fastest rotators among @xmath1 cephei pulsators , having projected rotational velocity of about 200 km  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is a high galactic latitude star with @xmath6 = @xmath727.5@xmath8 which locates it more than 1  kpc out of the galactic plane .",
    "there are several determinations of stellar parameters for sy equ .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath9 = 4.447  dex , @xmath10 = 3.7  dex from the high - resolution optical spectra and estimated a mass of 14  @xmath11 from the evolutionary tracks of @xcite . on the other hand , using geneva photometry , @xcite determined @xmath9 = 4.47 @xmath12 0.01 dex and @xmath10 = 3.9 @xmath12 0.3  dex .",
    "much lower value of effective temperature , @xmath9 = 4.401  dex , was obtained by @xcite from strmgren photometry and equivalent width of the h@xmath13 line .",
    "we adopt here stellar parameters derived from the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) spectra and visual photometry by @xcite : @xmath14 = 4.388 @xmath12 0.035 and @xmath10 = 3.905 @xmath12 0.1 .",
    "these values result in a mass estimate of 11.5 @xmath12 1.5  @xmath11 if the metallicity @xmath15 = 0.02 is assumed .",
    "the metallicity in terms of [ m / h ] , obtained from the iue / ines data , amounts to 0.00 @xmath12 0.21  dex , which corresponds to @xmath15 = 0.02@xmath16 .",
    "we prefer to rely on this determination because it uses ultraviolet spectral region , where b - type stars emit most of their energy .    in this note",
    "we give only a brief outline of our results .",
    "the full analysis will be published elsewhere .",
    "the new ccd photometry of sy equ was carried out in biakw observatory ( wrocaw university ) during five nights between august 14 and september 3 , 2004 .",
    "we used strmgren @xmath17 and cousins @xmath18 passbands .",
    "the obtained frames were calibrated in a standard way and then reduced using the profile - fitting and aperture photometry of the daophot package @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations of sy equ were obtained with the cassegrain spectrograph attached to the 1.88-m telescope of the david dunlap observatory ( university of toronto ) .",
    "the data consist of 171 spectra taken on 12 nights between august 8 and september 1 , 2004 , i.e. , simultaneously with the biakw photomety .",
    "the spectra were sampled over the range 40004600   with the 600 lines per mm grating giving a dispersion of 0.62   per pixel .",
    "the exposure times were 15 minutes long .",
    "the reductions were made with standard iraf routines , which include cosmic ray removal , bias correction , flat - fielding , and wavelength calibration .",
    "the spectra were moved to the heliocentric frame . in fig .",
    "[ mean_spectrum ] we show the mean spectrum of sy equ .",
    "the photometric light curve of sy equ is dominated by the mode with frequency @xmath19 = 6.029 d@xmath3 .",
    "the 2004 biakw @xmath20 photometry folded with the period of 0.165871  d = 1/@xmath19 is shown in fig .",
    "[ bialkow - phot ] . in order to search for possible low - amplitude modes , we combined three photometric datasets : geneva @xmath21-band data of @xcite , asas-3 @xmath21-band photometry @xcite and biakw 2004 data in the strmgren @xmath22 band .",
    "these data cover the time interval of almost 9 years , between 1997 and 2005 . in fig .",
    "[ fp - phot ] we plotted fourier periodograms of the combined @xmath21/@xmath22 data showing consecutive steps of prewhitening .",
    "we see that except for the well - known dominating mode , at least two low - amplitude modes are present .",
    "their frequencies are equal to 8.360 and 7.821  d@xmath3 , but due to the severe aliasing , their values are not certain .    , @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath18 photometric passbands are shown.,width=302 ]        for the spectroscopic data , we searched for intrinsic variations in the first four moments of four spectral lines : h@xmath24 , h@xmath25 , he4471 , and he4387 , labeled in fig .",
    "[ mean_spectrum ] .",
    "moreover , we did the same for radial velocities obtained by means of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) technique using the whole observed spectrum excluding the region of the intestellar band ( ib , fig .",

    "the radial velocity amplitudes of these two frequencies are 15 and 12 km s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "additionally , we found low - amplitude changes with 4.42  d@xmath3 and 0.61  d@xmath3 .",
    "the latter could be the rotation frequency of sy equ . in table 1",
    "we give frequencies which were identified after subsequent stages of prewhitening for three moments of two lines ( h@xmath24 and h@xmath25 ) and @xmath31(ccf ) .",
    "the important results is that we did not find the variation with frequency 2@xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the frequency of the dominant mode , in the second moments of the analyzed four lines .",
    "this leads immediately to the conclusion that the dominant frequency has to be a non - axisymmetric mode ( @xmath320 ) .",
    "recently @xcite suggested two additional modes with frequencies of 6.82902 and 4.81543  d@xmath3 , from the analysis of the geneva photometry .",
    "the former is probably an alias of our mode with 7.821  d@xmath3 , the presence of the latter was not confirmed in our analysis .",
    "we determined the amplitudes and phases of the light curves in @xmath0 bands and of the radial velocity variations . using these data for the dominant frequency",
    ", we identified its spherical harmonic degree , @xmath33 , by means of the method invented by daszyska , dziembowski and pamyatnykh @xcite .",
    "the method combines photometry and spectroscopy and consists of simultaneous determination of the @xmath33 value and the pulsation nonadiabatic parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath19 parameter describes the ratio of the relative luminosity variation to the radial displacement of the surface , and it gives information on subphotospheric layer . in the case of @xmath25 scuti stars , this new diagnostic tool probes the efficiency of convection @xcite , while in the case of @xmath1 cep stars , it provides a stringent probe of stellar opacities @xcite . from this method",
    ", we get the unambiguous @xmath34 identification . in fig .",
    "[ l - ident ] , we show the @xmath35 value as a function of @xmath33 . the horizontal line at @xmath35 = 2.1 corresponds to 95% confidence level . in the next step",
    ", we identified the azimuthal order , @xmath36 , from spectroscopy , using monochromatic amplitude and phase diagrams across the line profiles . in fig .",
    "[ m - ident ] we plot these diagrams across h@xmath24 .",
    "as one can see , the amplitude reaches a very sharp maximum in the line center , which indicates @xmath37 as the most probable identification .",
    "the sign of @xmath36 is obtained from the phase changes . because the phase decreases across the line profile with increasing wavelengths ,",
    "the mode must be prograde , @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the dominant frequency of sy equ is a sectoral prograde mode with @xmath39 .",
    "such mode identification excludes low inclination angles because sectoral modes are poorly seen when the star is observed near pole - on .     as a function of @xmath33 obtained for five models of sy equ .",
    "the models are located in the error box defined in sect .",

    "the line profile is plotted with a thin line and the amplitudes and phases with a thick one .",
    "errors are shown as grey shadows .",
    "right ordinate is given in flux units and refers to the line profile.,width=302 ]",
    "having identified the geometry of the main pulsation mode in terms of @xmath33 and @xmath36 parameters , we may compare the observed frequency of this mode with the theoretical predictions .",
    "for this purpose , stellar evolutionary models were calculated using warsaw - new jersey evolutionary code , assuming the opal opacities and the standard solar mixture of elements .",
    "linear nonadiabatic pulsation calculations were performed with the use of dziembowski s code , which includes the rotation effects on oscillation frequencies up to the second order in the rotational velocity .",
    "although sy equ rotates very fast ( at least 35% of the break - up velocity ) , we can neglect deviations from the spherical symmetry due to effects of centrifugal force , because the ratio of the rotation frequency to pulsation frequency is still much less than 0.5 .    in fig .",
    "[ freq - m12 ] , unstable modes with @xmath33 = 0 , 1 , and 2 for models with a mass of 12  @xmath11 , evolving from zams to tams , are shown .",

    "we consider two values of the rotational velocity , @xmath41= 0 and 200 kms@xmath3 .",
    "the vertical lines mark the range of effective temperatures determined from the iue spectra .",
    "the rotational velocity of sy equ is equal to at least 200 km s@xmath3 , which gives rotational frequency of @xmath300.6  d@xmath3 assuming the stellar radius of about 6.5 @xmath42 .",
    "if the frequency of 6.029 d@xmath3 ( solid horizontal line ) is a sectoral prograde mode , we have to compare theoretical values with the centroid of the @xmath33 = 2 mode which should be placed at about 4.8 d@xmath3 ( dotted horizontal line ) .",
    "= 0 , 1 , and 2 in a sequence of @xmath1 cephei star models with mass of 12 @xmath43 , assuming @xmath44 .",
    "the models cover the phase from zams to tams .",
    "the two panels show the effects of rotational velocity ( 0 and 200 kms@xmath3 ) on the pulsation frequencies.,width=302 ]    as one can see from fig .",
    "[ freq - m12 ] , for @xmath15 = 0.02 the pulsation instability begins at @xmath9 of about 4.41  dex , which is much lower than the effective temperature of sy equ used by some authors , e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "moreover , we checked the metallicity and mass effects on the instability domain considering several values of @xmath15 and @xmath45 .",
    "changing @xmath15 from 0.015 to 0.025 shifts the hottest unstable mode from @xmath46 4.40 to 4.42  dex .",
    "changing mass from 11 to 13  @xmath43 gives exactly the same effect on the hot edge of instability .",
    "we presented the results of the frequency analysis of both the photometric and spectroscopic time series of sy  equ . in both datasets",
    ", we found the dominant mode at @xmath2 = 6.029  d@xmath3 , and several new candidate frequencies . moreover , there is a low - frequency variation at @xmath47 = 0.197  d@xmath3 detected in radial velocities , which can be an evidence of the binary motion or the excitation of a gravity mode . for the dominant mode we confirmed the @xmath33 = 2 identification of @xcite and identified the azimuthal order , @xmath36 = @xmath482 .",
    "it means that the dominant frequency is a sectoral prograde mode with @xmath33 = 2 .",
    "however , one has to be aware that at @xmath49 200 kms@xmath3 , the rotational mode coupling can take place , if the frequency difference between modes @xmath50 and @xmath51 is of the order of angular velocity of rotation , and if the spherical harmonic indices satisfy the relation @xmath52 2 , see @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite made an attempt of comparisons of theoretical frequencies with the observed value of the dominant mode , but the authors totally ignored the effects of rotation and the instability condition .",
    "our analysis showed that only for lower effective temperatures we enter the instability domain .",
    "these temperature values agree very well with the range determined from the ultraviolet iue spectra",
