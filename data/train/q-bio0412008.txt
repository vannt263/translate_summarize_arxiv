    "single domain globular proteins , which are finite sized objects , undergo remarkably cooperative transitions from an ensemble of unfolded states to well ordered folded ( or native ) states as the temperature is lowered @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the transition to the native state takes place in an apparent two - state manner , i.e. the only detectable species are the native ( more precisely , the ensemble of conformations belonging to the native basin of attraction @xcite ) or unfolded states @xcite . in order to characterize the two - state folding one can use the dimensionless quantity @xmath0 @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are the vant hoff and the calorimetric enthalpy , respectively , @xmath10 is the specific heat . @xmath0",
    "may be considered as a measure of the calorimetric cooperativity . since",
    "real globular proteins have @xmath0 very close to unity ( chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 is a prime example @xcite ) it was proposed that @xcite @xmath11 can serve as one of requirements for realistic models of proteins .",
    "there are technical problems in evaluating @xmath12 using experiments or computations .",
    "inadequate treatment of baseline subtractions in @xmath10 obscures estimates of @xmath12 . as a result it is possible that even sequences with @xmath3 may not clearly be two - state folders .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath12 or related measures have often been used as a measure of calorimetric cooperativity .    in series of works",
    "@xcite chan _",
    "et al . _ have shown that the calorimetric criterion is difficult to satisfy theoretically .",
    "even go models @xcite which are more cooperative than others ( 2-letter , 3-letter and 20-letter models ) have @xmath0 notably smaller than 1 .",
    "the studies of the chan group are limited to few sequences and it remains , therefore , unclear if the go modeling can meet the calorimetric requirement .",
    "one of our goals is to try to solve this problem by carrying out comprehensive simulations of lattice go models .",
    "another dimensionless measure of thermodynamic cooperativity is @xmath13 defined as follows @xcite @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the structural overlap with the native state and it can be identified as the probability of occupation of the native basin of attraction , @xmath16 is the folding temperature and @xmath17 is the transition width @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 may be referred to as the structural cooperativity .",
    "recently , we have shown that @xcite it grows with the chain length as @xmath18 , where the universal exponent @xmath19 .",
    "this result is supported by experimental data collected for 32 two - state wild type proteins and by simulations for lattice models .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to consider the finite size effects on @xmath0 of two - state folders with the help of lattice go models and monte carlo simulations . from the definition of @xmath12",
    "it follows that it should be independent of @xmath1 because both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are extensive variables .",
    "however , the approach to the asymptotic behavior is unclear .",
    "we have studied two classes of models : lattice models without side chains ( lm ) and lattice models with side chain ( lmsc ) . for the first class , in accord with experiments ,",
    "@xmath12 was found to be scale - invariant at least up to @xmath22 .",
    "however , for 78 sequences studied their average value @xmath23 which is clearly smaller unity .",
    "thus , in agreement with the previous results @xcite , go lms do not satisfy the proteinlike cooperativity principle although they are minimally frustrated .    for go lmscs we have found that @xmath0 scales with @xmath1 as @xmath24 before reaching the maximal value 1 at the critical value @xmath6 . here",
    "exponent @xmath25 .",
    "these results suggest that @xmath0 becomes scale - invariant for @xmath26 and the lmscs can meet the strict calorimetric cooperativity criterion only for this range of system sizes . if one assumes that the all - or - non folding takes place at @xmath27 then the critical value @xmath28 is reduced to @xmath29 ( see below ) . in this case",
    "the lmsc with @xmath30 can capture the calorimetric behavior of two - state proteins .",
    "in the coarse grained representation of lm each amino acid is represented as a single bead confined to the vertices of a cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "the lmsc is also modeled on a cubic lattice by a backbone ( bb ) sequence of @xmath1 beads , to which a `` side '' bead , representing a side chain , is attached .",
    "the peptide bond and the @xmath31-carbon are given by a single bead and the system has in total 2@xmath1 beads .",
    "self - avoidance is imposed , i.e. any backbone and side beads can not occupy the same lattice site more than once .    in the lmsc",
    "the energy of a conformation is @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are bb - bb , bb - sc and sc - sc contact energies . @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the distances between the @xmath37 and @xmath38 residues for the bb - bb , bb - sc and sc - sc pairs , respectively , @xmath39 is lattice spacing .",
    "energies @xmath33 and @xmath34 are chosen to be -1 for native contacts and 0 for non - native ones .",
    "for the lm the energy in eq .",
    "( [ energy_eq ] ) has only the bb term .",
    "the specific heat in eq . ( [ vanthoff_eq ] ) is defined as the energy fluctuation . for lmsc",
    "the overlap function @xmath15 is defined as @xmath40 , \\label{chi_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the upper script @xmath1 refers to the native state and factor @xmath41 ensures that @xmath42 in the native conformation . the last equation with only the bb term",
    "is applied to the lms .",
    "the monte carlo simulations were carried out using the move set ms3 @xcite which involves single , double and triple bead moves . because this move set involves multiparticle updates it is much more efficient compared to the standard move set @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic properties are calculated using the multiple histogram method @xcite .",
    "sequences are selected as two - state folders if their free energy plotted against the number of native contacts has two well - defined minima .",
    "[ sc40_s1_fig]a shows the typical native conformation of the @xmath43 lmsc sequence .",
    "the free energy is calculated as a function of the number of native contacts , which is treated as an approximate reaction coordinate for go models , and the corresponding results obtained at @xmath44 are shown in fig .",
    "[ sc40_s1_fig]b .",
    "since the free energy profile has only one local maximum located at the transition state this sequence is a two - state folder . clearly , for go models the peaks of @xmath45 and @xmath46 coincide ( fig .",
    "[ sc40_s1_fig]c ) .",
    "[ bt_vhove_fig]a shows the structural cooperativity against the calorimetric one for a given value of @xmath1 .",
    "as expected , @xmath47 grows with @xmath12 for both lms and lmscs .",
    "however , the relation between these quantities becomes non - trivial if we combine the results for all values of @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ bt_vhove_fig]b and fig .",
    "[ bt_vhove_fig]c ) .",
    "the correlation remains strong for lmscs but surprisingly it almost vanishes for lms .",
    "it is not clear if the absence of correlation for the lms is intrinsic or it is merely an artifact of the limited set of data .",
    "clarification of this point requires further investigation . from all sequences 176 sequences studied ( 78 lm sequences and 98 lmsc ones ) 10 sequences",
    "have @xmath48 and only one sequence which has @xmath49 nearly satisfies the calorimetric cooperativity principle .",
    "since @xmath12 of the lms is not sensitive to @xmath1 we can calculate its averaged value over the whole data set ( 78 sequences ) and obtain @xmath50 which is notably smaller than unity .",
    "thus our results , which are in accord with kaya and chan , also suggest that it is hard to meet the calorimetric criterion for go lms for any chain length . using the relation @xmath51 derived from the random energy model @xcite , where @xmath52 is interpreted as the temperature below which folding kinetics is dominated by trapping mechanisms @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath53 .",
    "this value is far below the proposed @xmath54 @xcite required for the two - state melting with @xmath55 but higher than , say , @xmath56 for three - letter models @xcite .",
    "the difference in the scaling behavior of lms and lmscs is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ scaling_fig]a where the size effect is visible only for sequences with sc . from the log - log plot ( fig .",
    "[ scaling_fig]b ) we obtain exponent @xmath57 .",
    "interpolating our results to @xmath58 we find the critical length @xmath6 above which lmscs always satisfy the calorimetric cooperativity requirement .",
    "if we assume that the transition is two - state if @xmath27 then the calorimetric cooperativity is satisfied for @xmath30 , where @xmath59 .",
    "we have shown that for a given system size the structural cooperativity correlates with the calorimetric one .",
    "the scaling of the calorimetric cooperativity has been examined for lattice two - state go models of proteins .",
    "the lms superficially mimic experiments in the sense that @xmath12 is almost insensitive to the system sizes . however , they are not able to reproduce the experimental value @xmath3 .",
    "the rate of success for designing a go lm which have @xmath27 is rather low ( about @xmath60 ) .",
    "the lack of scaling of lm folding cooperativity with chain length prevents these models to describe the cooperativity of wild - type proteins .",
    "this appears to be an inherent deficiency of lm without side chains .",
    "for the go lmscs @xmath12 depends on the system size up to the critical size @xmath28 above which the full requirement of the calorimetric cooperativity is satisfied .",
    "their advantage is that the criterion @xmath27 may be satisfied for relatively small globular proteins ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "our study shows that incorporation of side chains in protein lm represents a crucial modification , which makes lmsc protein - like .",
    "it should be noted that we have considered the pairwise interaction ( [ energy_eq ] ) for go models and it may be the reason why the calorimetric criterion is hard to fulfill even for lmscs .",
