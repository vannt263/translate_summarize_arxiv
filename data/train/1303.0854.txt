    "the notion of mesh patterns was introduced by brndn and claesson @xcite to provide explicit expansions for certain permutation statistics as , possibly infinite , linear combinations of ( classical ) permutation patterns .",
    "this notion was further studied in @xcite .",
    "kitaev and remmel @xcite initiated the systematic study of distribution of quadrant marked mesh patterns on permutations .",
    "the study was extended to 132-avoiding permutations by kitaev , remmel and tiefenbruck in @xcite , and the present paper continues this line of research .",

    "for example , the graph of the permutation @xmath14 is pictured in figure [ fig : basic ] . then if we draw a coordinate system centered at a point @xmath12 , we will be interested in the points that lie in the four quadrants i , ii , iii , and iv of that coordinate system as pictured in figure [ fig : basic ] . for any @xmath15 and any @xmath16 , the set of all permutations of length @xmath17",

    "note that if a coordinate in @xmath18 is 0 , then there is no condition imposed on the points in the corresponding quadrant .",
