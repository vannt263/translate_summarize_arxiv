    "it is intuitive that the gravitational collapse of a set of @xmath0 masses is directly related to the formation of astrophysical structures like globular clusters or elliptical galaxies ( the presence of gas may complicate the pure gravitational @xmath0-body problem for spiral galaxies ) . from an analytical point of view",
    ", this problem is very difficult .",
    "when @xmath0 is much larger than 2 , direct approach is intractable , and since poincar results of non analyticity , exact solutions may be unobtainable . in the context of statistical physics ,",
    "the situation is more favorable and , in a dissipationless approximation - body problem because the ratio of the two - body relaxation time over the dynamical time is of the order of @xmath0 . for a system composed of more than @xmath1 massive particles a study during a few hundreds dynamical times",
    "can really be considered as dissipationless , the unique source of dissipation being two - body encounters .",
    "] , leads to the collisionless boltzmann equation ( hereafter denoted by cbe ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the distribution function of the system with respect to the canonically conjugated @xmath5 phase space variables and the mean field gravitational potential .",
    "as noted initially by @xcite , this formalism holds for such systems if and only if we consider @xmath0 identical point masses equal to @xmath6 .",
    "this problem splits naturally into two related parts : the time dependent regime and the stationary state .",
    "we can reasonably think that these two problems are not completely understood . the transient time dependent regime was investigated mainly considering self - similar solutions ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these studies conclude that power law solutions can exist for the spatial dependence of the gravitational potential ( with various powers ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is no study which indicates clearly that the time dependence of the solutions disappears in a few dynamical times , giving a well defined equilibrium - like state . on the other hand ,",
    "applying jeans theorem ( e.g. @xcite hereafter bt87 , p. 220 ) , it is quite easy to find a stationary solution .",
    "for example , every positive and integrable function of the mean field energy per mass unit @xmath7 is a potential equilibrium distribution function for a spherical isotropic system .",
    "several approaches are possible to choose the equilibrium distribution function .",
    "thermodynamics ( violent relaxation paradigm : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) indicate that isothermal spheres or polytropic systems are good candidates .",
    "stability analyses can be split into two categories . in the cbe context ( see @xcite for a review ) , it is well known that spherical systems ( with decreasing spatial density ) are generally stable except in the case where a large radial anisotropy is present in the velocity space .",
    "this is the radial orbit instability , hereafter denoted by roi ( see @xcite , and @xcite for a detailed analytic and numeric study of these phenomena ) which leads to a bar - like equilibrium state in a few dynamical times . in the context of thermodynamics of self - gravitating systems , in a pioneering work by @xcite",
    ", it was shown that an important density contrast leads to the collapse of the core of system ( see @xcite for details ) . in all these studies",
    "there is no definitive conclusion , and the choice of the equilibrium distribution remains unclear .",
    "introducing observations and taking into account analytical constraints , several models are possible : chronologically , we can cite ( see for example bt87 , p. 223",
    "- 239 ) the plummer model ( or other polytropic models ) , de vaucouleurs @xmath8 law , king and isochrone hnon model or more recently the very simple but interesting hernquist model ( @xcite ) for spherical isotropic systems . in the anisotropic case ,",
    "ossipkov - merritt or generalized polytropes can be considered . finally for non spherical systems",
    ", there also exists some models reviewed in bt87 ( p. 245 - 266 ) . considering this wide variety of possibilities",
    ", one can try to make accurate numerical simulations to clarify the situation .",
    "surprisingly , such a program has not been completely carried on . in a pioneering work",
    ", @xcite remarked that the dissipationless collapse of a clumpy cloud of @xmath0 equal masses could lead to a final stationary state that is quite similar to elliptical galaxies .",
    "this kind of study was reconsidered in an important work by @xcite , with more details and a crucial remark concerning the correlation between the final shape ( spherical or oblate ) and the virial ratio of the initial state .",
    "these authors explain this feature invoking roi .",
    "some more recent studies ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) concentrate on some particularities of the preceding works .",
    "finally , two works ( @xcite and @xcite ) develop new ideas considering the influence of the hubble flow on the collapse .",
    "however , the problem is only partially depicted .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyse the dissipationless collapse of a large set of n body systems with a very wide variety of ` realistic ' initial conditions . as we will see , the small number of particles involved",
    ", the numerical technique or the specificity of the previous works did not allow their authors to reach a sufficiently precise conclusion .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe in detail the numerical procedures used in our experiments .",
    "section 3 describes the results we have obtained .",
    "these results are then interpreted in section 4 , where some conclusions and perspectives are also proposed .",
    "the treecode used to perform our simulations is a modified version of the @xcite treecode , parallelised by d. pfenniger using the mpi library .",
    "we implemented some computations of observables and adapted the code to suit our specific problems .",
    "the main features of this code are a hierarchical @xmath9 algorithm for the gravitational force calculation and a leap - frog algorithm for the time integration .",
    "we introduced an adaptative time step , based on a very simple physical consideration .",
    "the time step is equal to a fraction @xmath10 of the instantaneous dynamical time @xmath11 ( is adapted to the virial parameter @xmath12 and ranges roughly from @xmath13 when @xmath14 to @xmath15 when @xmath16 .",

    "we generate two uniform random numbers @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and set @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the gaussian standard deviation .",
    "some of our initial systems are homogeneous systems with a global rotation around the @xmath54-axis .",
    "the method we choose to generate such initial conditions is the following .",
    "we create a homogeneous and isotropic system ( an h - type system ) .",
    "we then compute the average velocity of the particles .",

    "in some models , the value of @xmath72 and @xmath73 depends on the range of mass that is considered .",
    "we have used several types of mass functions , among them the initial mass function given by @xcite @xmath74 , the one given by @xcite @xmath75 and an @xmath76 mass function @xmath77 . in order to generate masses following these functions ,",

    "we did not set the total energy @xmath123 of the system to @xmath124 because we wanted to prescribe instead the initial virial ratio @xmath26 , the size @xmath42 of the system and its mass @xmath79 .",

    "the non conservation of the energy during the numerical evolution has three main sources.the softening parameter @xmath133 introduced in the potential calculus ( cf .",
    "equation [ defpot ] ) is an obvious one .",
    "this parameter introduces a lower cutoff @xmath134 in the resolution of length in the simulations .",
    "following @xcite , structural details up to scale @xmath135 are sensitive to the value of @xmath133 .",
    "moreover , in order to be compatible with the collisionless hypothesis , the softening parameter must be greater than the scale where important collisions can occur . still following @xcite ,",
    "this causes @xmath136 in our collapse simulation with @xmath137 particles , this results in @xmath138 .",
    "the discretization of time integration introduces inevitably another source of energy non conservation , particularly during the collapse .",
    "the force computation also generates errors .",
    "the choice of the opening angle @xmath139 , which governs the accuracy of the force calculation of the treecode , is a compromise between speed and accuracy .",

    "this trade - off allowed to perform simulations with less than @xmath143 energy variation without requiring too much computing time .",
    "for each of our experiments , the total cpu time ranges between 3 to 24 hours for @xmath144 and @xmath137 particles .",
    "the total agregated cpu time of all our collapse experiments is approximately 6 months.we have tested two other values of the softening parameter ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) for several typical simulations .",
    "these tests did not reveal significant variations of the computed observables .      as indicators of the geometry of the system , we computed axial ratios , radii containing @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) , @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) and @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) of the mass , density profile @xmath153 and equilibrium core radius .",
    "the axial ratios are computed with the eigenvalues @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 of the ( 3x3 ) inertia matrix @xmath157 , where @xmath158 and , if the position of the particle @xmath159 is @xmath160 @xmath161 the axial ratios @xmath162 and @xmath163 are given by @xmath164 and @xmath165 . the density profile @xmath166 , which depends only on the radius @xmath46 , together with the @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) have a physical meaning only for spherical or nearly spherical systems .",
    "for all the spatial indicators computations we have only considered particles whose distance to the center of mass of the system is less than @xmath169 of the system .",
    "this assumption excludes particles which are inevitably ` ejected ' during the collapse .",
    "for example , the number of excluded particles is 0% for h@xmath170 , 3% for c@xmath171 , 5% for h@xmath87 , 22% for c@xmath172 and 31% for h@xmath92.].after the collapse a core - halo structure forms in the system . in order to measure the radius of the core , we have computed the density radius as defined by casertano and hut ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the density radius is a good estimator of the theoretical and observational core radius.we have also computed the radial density of the system .",

    ", the simulations presented hereafter have been performed using @xmath210 particles .",
    "an important study by @xcite shows that , in the case of an initial density profile @xmath211 , the shape of the virialized state depends on @xmath212 : a very small @xmath12 leads to a flattened equilibrium state , when a more quiet collapse produces a spherical one .",
    "our investigations concern a wide range of different initial conditions ( homogeneous , clumpy , ... ) and show that the influence of @xmath12 depends on the properties of the initial system .",
    "figure [ axialratio ] shows the axial ratios of the equilibrium state reached by our simulations .",
    "in fact , only a few simulations produced a final state with an ellipticity greater than e1 . every homogeneous initial condition ( i.e. h@xmath213 , g@xmath214 and m@xmath215 ) resulted in a spherical equilibrium state independently of the values of @xmath12 we tested .",

    "now let us consider another new segregation appearing in the velocity space .",
    "each equilibrium state is associated with a constant temperature @xmath259 , calculated using equation @xmath260 .",
    "more precisely , we have calculated the temporal mean value of the temperatures , evaluated every one hundred time units . as we can see in figure [ stabtemp ] , after the collapse and whatever the nature of the initial system is , the temperature is a very stable parameter .",
    "+ figure [ et ] shows the @xmath261 diagram of the set of all non rotating simulations .",
    "it reveals a very interesting feature of post - collapse self - gravitating systems .",
    "on the one hand , the set of systems with a total energy @xmath262 can be linearly fitted in the @xmath261 plane .",
    "we call this set low branch 1 ( hereafter denoted by lb1 , see figure [ et ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the set of the systems with a total energy @xmath263 splits into two families .",
    "the first is an exact continuation of lb1 .",
    "hence we named it low branch 2 ( hereafter denoted by lb2 ) .",
    "the second can also be linearly fitted , but with a much greater slope ( one order of magnitude ) .",
    "we label this family high branch ( hereafter denoted by hb ) . in lb1 or lb2",
    ", we find every h , g , and m systems with @xmath264 , every p and every c with @xmath265 . in hb",
    ", we find c@xmath102 and every h , g and m systems with @xmath266 .",
    "this segregation thus affects violent collapses ( cold initial data ) : on the one hand , when @xmath267 all systems are on lb1 , on the other hand for @xmath266 , initially homogeneous or quasi - homogeneous ( e.g. c@xmath268 ) systems reach hb when initially inhomogeneous systems stay on lb2 instead .",
    "let us now recapitulate the results we have obtained and propose an interpretation :    1 .",
    "the equilibrium state produced by the collapse of a set of @xmath0 gravitating particles is @xmath269independent provided that @xmath270 .",
    "2 .   without any rotation ,",
    "the dissipationless collapse of a set of gravitating particles can produce two relatively distinct equilibrium states : * if the initial set is homogeneous , the equilibrium has a large core and a steep envelope .",
    "* if the initial set contains significant inhomogeneities ( @xmath271 for clumpy systems or @xmath272 for power law systems ) , the equilibrium state has only a small core around of which the density falls down regularly .",
    "+ the explanation of this core size segregation is clear : it is associated to the antonov core - collapse instability occurring when the density contrast between central and outward region of a gravitating system is very big . as a matter of fact , if the initial set contains inhomogeneities , these collapse much more quickly than the whole system and fall quickly into the central regions .",
    "the density contrast becomes then very large and the antonov instability triggers producing a core collapse phenomenon .",
    "the rest of the system then smoothly collapses around this collapsed core .",
    "if there are no inhomogeneities in the initial set , the system collapses as a whole , central density grows slowly without reaching the triggering value of the antonov instability .",
    "a large core then forms .",
    "later evolution can also produce core collapse : this is what occurs for our m@xmath122 system ( see figure [ comparplot ] ) .",
    "this is an initially homogeneous system with kroupa mass spectrum which suffers a very strong collapse .",
    "as the mass spectrum is not sufficient to bring quickly enough a lot of mass in the center of the system , antonov instability does not trigger and a large core forms . as",
    "the collapse is very violent , an increasing significant part of particles are progressively  ejected  and the core collapse takes progressively place .",
    "this is the same phenomenon which is generally invoked to explain the collapsed core of some old globular clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) : during its dynamical evolution in the galaxy , some stars are tidally extracted from a globular cluster , to compensate this loss the cluster concentrate its core , increasing then the density contrast , triggering sooner or later the antonov instability .",
    "3 .   without any rotation ,",
    "the collapse ( violent or quiet ) of an homogeneous set of gravitating particles produces an e0 ( i.e. spherical ) isotropic equilibrium state .",
    "there are two possible ways to obtain a flattened equilibrium : * introduce a large amount of inhomogeneity near the center in the initial state , and make a violent collapse ( @xmath266 ) .",
    "* introduce a sufficient amount ( @xmath273 ) of rotation in the initial state .",
    "+ these two ways have not the same origin and do not produce the same equilibrium state . in the first case , one can reasonably invoke the radial orbit instability : as a matter of fact , as it is explained in a lot of works ( see @xcite for example ) two features are associated to this phenomenon .",
    "first of all , it is an instability which needs an equilibrium state from which it grows .",
    "secondly , it triggers only when a sufficient amount of radial orbits are present .",
    "the only non rotating flattened systems we observed just combine this two conditions : sufficient amount of radial orbits because the collapse is violent and something from which roi can grow because we have seen in the previous point that inhomogeneities collapse first and quickly join the center .",
    "the fact that cold p@xmath274 systems are more flattened than c@xmath274 ones is in complete accordance with our interpretation : as a matter of fact , by construction , power law systems have an initial central overdensity , whereas clumpy systems create ( quickly but not instantaneously ) this overdensity bringing the collapsed clumps near the center .",
    "the roi flattening is oblate ( @xmath275 and @xmath276 ) .",
    "+ the rotational flattening is more natural and occurs when the centrifugal force overcomes the gravitational pressure .",
    "the rotational  flattening is prolate ( @xmath277 and @xmath278 ) .",
    "we notice that initial rotation must be invoked with parsimony to explain the ellipticity of some globular clusters or elliptical galaxies . as a matter of fact ,",
    "these objects are very weakly rotating systems and our study has shown that the amount of rotation is almost constant during the collapse .",
    "spherical equilibria can be suitably fitted by both isothermal and polytropic laws with various indexes .",
    "it suggests that any distribution function of the energy exhibiting an adaptable core halo structure ( polytrope , isothermal , king , hernquist , ... ) can suitably fit the equilibrium produced by the collapse of our initial conditions .",
    "there exists a temperature segregation between equilibrium states .",
    "it concerns only initially cold systems ( i.e. systems which will suffer a violent collapse ) : for such systems when @xmath279 decreases , the equilibrium temperature @xmath259 increases much more for initially homogeneous systems than for initially inhomogeneous systems . on the other hand ,",
    "whatever their initial homogeneity , quiet collapses are rather all equivalent from the point of view of the equilibrium temperature : @xmath259 increases in the same way for all systems as @xmath279 decreases .",
    "this feature may be the result of the larger influence of the dynamical friction induced by the primordial core on the rapid particles in a violent collapse .",
    "all these properties may be directly confronted to physical data from globular clusters ( see harris catalogue @xcite ) or galaxies observations .",
    "+ as a matter of fact , in the standard `` bottom - up '' scenario of the hierarchical growth of structures , galaxies naturally form from very inhomogeneous medium .",
    "our study then suggests for the equilibrium state of such objects a potential flattening and a collapsed core .",
    "this is in very good accordance with the e0 to e7 observed flatness of elliptical galaxies and may be a good explanation for the presence of massive black hole in the center of galaxies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ on the other hand globular clusters observations show that these are spherical objects ( the few low flattened clusters all possess a low amount of rotation ) , and that their core is generally not collapsed ( the collapsed core of almost 10% of the galactic globular clusters can be explained by their dynamical evolution through the galaxy ) .",
    "our study then expect that globular clusters form from homogeneous media .",
    "+ these conclusions can be tested using the @xmath261 plane . as a matter of fact",
    ", we expect that an @xmath261 plane build from galactic data would not present any high branch whereas the same plane build from globular clusters data would .",

    "we thank joshua e. barnes , who wrote the original treecode .",
    "we also particularly thank daniel pfenniger for the use of the parallel treecode .",
