    "a remarkable aspect of the copper - oxide high-@xmath6 superconductors is that various ordering phenomena apparently compete , including commensurate and incommensurate magnetism , superconducting pairing , and charge - density - wave formation .",
    "( more exotic states have also been proposed , but not verified experimentally beyond doubt . ) while commensurate magnetism and superconductivity are common phases in essentially all families of cuprates , the role of other instabilities for the global features of the phase diagram is less clear .    a particularly interesting role is taken by charge - density waves .",
    "such states break the discrete lattice translation symmetry , with examples being stripe , checkerboard , and valence - bond order . in the compounds",
    "la@xmath4ba@xmath5cuo@xmath7  and la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath7  ( with nd or eu co - doping ) evidence for stripe - like spin and charge modulations with static long - range order were detected,@xcite in particular near 1/8th doping .",
    "( this is supported e.g. by strong phonon anomalies seen in neutron scattering experiments.@xcite ) while in other cuprate families similar long - range order has not been found , signatures of short - range charge order , likely pinned by impurities , have been observed in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) on underdoped bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3@xcite and ca@xmath4na@xmath5cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2.@xcite the low - energy electronic structure in the presence of charge order turns out to be remarkable : in la@xmath8ba@xmath9cuo@xmath7 , angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) indicated a quasiparticle ( qp ) gap with @xmath1-wave like form , i.e. , charge order coexists with gapless ( nodal ) qp in @xmath10 direction ( while antinodal qp near @xmath11 are gapped).@xcite stm data on both underdoped bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3  and ca@xmath4na@xmath5cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2  show qp interference arising from coherent low - energy states near the nodes , whereas electronic states at higher energy and wavevectors close to the antinode are dominated by the real - space modulation of the short - range charge order.@xcite this dichotomy in momentum space is has also been found in arpes experiments in la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath7,@xcite bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3,@xcite and ca@xmath4na@xmath5cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2@xcite where well - defined nodal and ill - defined antinodal qp are frequently observed .",
    "these results suggest that momentum - space differentiation and tendencies toward charge ordering are common to underdoped cuprates.@xcite the concept of _ fluctuating stripes _ , i.e. , almost charge - ordered states , has been discussed early on.@xcite this concept , appropriate for compounds without static long - range order , assumes the existence of a nearby stripe - ordered state , with physical observables being influenced by the low - lying collective modes associated with a charge - ordering instability .",
    "following this idea , we have recently calculated@xcite the spin excitation spectrum of slowly fluctuating ( or disordered ) stripes .",
    "we were able to show that fluctuating stripes give rise to an `` hour - glass '' magnetic spectrum , very similar to that observed in neutron scattering experiments both on la@xmath4ba@xmath5cuo@xmath7@xcite and yba@xmath2cu@xmath12o@xmath13.@xcite    = 2.5 in    the focus of this paper is on the electronic structure of stripe states .",
    "we introduce the concept of `` @xmath1-wave stripes '' : here the modulation of charge densities has primarily a @xmath1-wave form factor , i.e. , lives more on the bonds than on the sites of the square lattice , leaving nodal qp unaffected .",
    "we illustrate that a picture of such bond - centered charge order , coexisting with superconductivity ( this state may be dubbed `` valence - bond supersolid '' ) is consistent with various features seen in both arpes and stm measurements . in particular , the real - space pattern of @xmath1-wave stripes , fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] , is strikingly similar to the stm results of ref .",

    "( a ) the @xmath1-density wave ( or staggered - flux ) phase@xcite was proposed as a candidate for the pseudogap .",
    "however , it has no measurable charge modulation and shall not be discussed here .",
    "( b ) checkerboard ( or plaquette ) order@xcite is related to stripes . while both can occur as stable phases ( with similar energetics ) in variants of the @xmath14-@xmath15 model,@xcite there are key experimental facts pointing towards stripe instead checkerboard order being the primary instability : ( i ) the stm data@xcite clearly show that the rotation symmetry is locally broken from c@xmath7 down to c@xmath2 .",
    "( ii ) the momentum - space pattern of spin excitations arising from checkerboard order has been shown to be incompatible with the neutron response of materials like la@xmath4ba@xmath5cuo@xmath7  or yba@xmath2cu@xmath12o@xmath13.@xcite",
    "numerous microscopic calculations , for hubbard or @xmath14-@xmath15 models at low doping , have indicated a tendency towards states with broken translational symmetry.@xcite at low temperatures @xmath16 , it is conceivable that this coexists with superconductivity.@xcite in fact , such a scenario can be expected on general grounds : upon destroying magnetic order in a square - lattice antiferromagnet ( af ) , paramagnetic states with valence - bond ( or spin - peierls ) order are known to appear.@xcite the introduction of charge carriers by doping then leads to superconductivity , coexisting with bond order for a finite doping range.@xcite a global phase diagram has been worked out using a sp(@xmath17 ) mean - field theory applied to the @xmath14-@xmath15 model supplemented by longer - range coulomb interaction:@xcite at small doping , superconducting bond - centered stripe states occur , while homogeneous @xmath1-wave superconductivity is realized at larger doping .",
    "( depending on microscopic parameters , the stripes may get replaced by checkerboard or spin - peierls states . )",
    "related superconducting charge - ordered states also appear in other theoretical treatments.@xcite    let us specify the various types of translational symmetry breaking on a square lattice , assuming the magnetic su(2 ) symmetry to be unbroken .",
    "( a ) spin - peierls states have a @xmath18 unit cell where all sites are equivalent , but the bonds are modulated .",

    "( c ) checkerboard states have a @xmath24 unit cell , both sites and bonds are modulated , @xmath25 , but c@xmath7 is intact . while stripe and checkerboard states can in principle be either site- or bond - centered , experimental evidence points towards bond - centered structures.@xcite in a quasiparticle picture , the symmetry - breaking orders can be translated into expectation values of fermionic bilinears : @xmath26 captures homogeneous superconductivity , with @xmath27 for @xmath1-wave pairing , while @xmath28 and @xmath29 originate from charge order .",
    "the directional dependence of @xmath30 can be decomposed according to the representations of the point group . in the presence of unidirectional order ,",
    "i.e. , c@xmath7 broken down to c@xmath2 , the @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave order parameters inevitably mix .",
    "our superconducting stripe states below will have @xmath31 all non - zero .",
    "( note that e.g. @xmath32 alone generates a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov state . )",
    "stripe states are best discussed in real space ( phrased in the following for a square lattice of cu atoms , keeping in mind that bonds of this lattice correspond to oxygen orbitals ) .",
    "naively , the primary phenomenon of stripe order is a modulation of the on - site charge densities , @xmath33 , which translates into a momentum - independent ( i.e. @xmath0-wave ) order parameter @xmath34 .",
    "however , general arguments indicate@xcite that the physics behind local ordering acts on bonds instead of sites : stripe formation is driven by the competition between kinetic and magnetic energies , both living on lattice bonds .",
    "in such a bond - dominated stripe state , modulations in quantities like @xmath35 can locally have different signs on horizontal and vertical bonds , implying a @xmath1-wave component of @xmath34 .",
    "given the mixing of @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave components , stripe states may have ordering primarily in either the @xmath0- or the @xmath1-wave channel . in the following , we shall argue in favor of stripes dominated by the @xmath1-wave component .",
    "fourier - transforming @xmath34 into real space@xcite leads to a stripe state as in fig .",

    "arguments in favor of stripes with a dominant @xmath1-wave component ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] ) are:@xcite ( i ) energetics : in the hole - poor regions , strong horizontal bonds form due to the tendency towards dimerization ( i.e. optimizing the magnetic energy ) , whereas in the hole - rich regions strong vertical bonds form optimizing the hole kinetic energy .",
    "( ii ) coulomb interaction disfavors on - site charge modulations and thus suppresses the @xmath0-wave component .",
    "if stripe order coexists with superconductivity , then the bond pairing amplitudes , @xmath36 , will be non - zero as well .",
    "starting from a homogeneous @xmath1-wave superconductor , stripe order will induce a modulated @xmath0-wave pairing component , described by @xmath37 .",
    "superconducting stripe states can be obtained in sp(@xmath17 ) mean - field theory.@xcite consider an extended @xmath14-@xmath15 hamiltonian for fermions without double occupancies , @xmath38 , with spin @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the physical value ) : @xmath41 \\label{e1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 .",
    "the spin operators @xmath43 are fermion bilinears times the traceless generators of @xmath44 .",

    "the average doping @xmath48 is fixed by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the number of lattice sites .",

    "we are left with a bilinear hamiltonian which can be diagonalized by a bogoliubov transformation . at the saddle point ,",
    "the slave - boson amplitudes fulfill @xmath57 , and the link fields are given by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the antisymmetric @xmath60 tensor .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath52 is found be minimizing the saddle - point free energy , here the coulomb repulsion @xmath61 enters ( on a classical level only ) .    at non - zero doping and @xmath62 , all mean - field phases are superconducting . at larger @xmath63 , the on - site charge distribution is homogeneous except for tiny doping , but bond - order of spin - peierls type occurs at low doping .",
    "the doping dependence of the gap energy scale is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] ; it roughly follows the experimentally established pseudogap scale @xmath64 .    at smaller @xmath63 ,",
    "stripe order occurs over a sizable doping range . as in most mean - field theories , the tendency toward ordering",
    "is overestimated : in a large parameter regime , the mean - field theory predicts bond - centered stripes with maximal charge inhomogeneity and strong bond order.@xcite to obtain the electronic structure for a more realistic stripe state from the mean - field theory , we have employed the following modifications : ( i ) the distribution of on - site hole densities within the unit cell is enforced by hand through the @xmath52 values .",
    "( ii ) the parameter @xmath63 is chosen such that the system is in the bond - ordered regime , but close to the transition to homogeneous superconductivity .",
    "these modifications anticipate that both quantum effects and coulomb repulsion ( beyond the classical approximation ) reduce the amplitude of the charge modulations.@xcite [ density - matrix renormalization group calculations for the 2d @xmath14-@xmath15 model ( with realistic @xmath46 ) showed signatures for bond - centered stripes with reduced on - site modulation amplitude.@xcite ]    a sample result for the electronic spectrum of a period-4 stripe state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsp ] . in this calculation , the hole distribution was fairly inhomogeneous , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and the link fields @xmath67 varied by a factor of four within the unit cell .",
    "thus , the stripe state contained both sizable @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave components . nevertheless , the spectrum is essentially gapless along the @xmath68-space diagonal , while a large gap appears near the antinodes , fig .",
    "[ fig : dsp ] .",
    "this toy calculation illustrates a key point , namely bond - centered stripe order _ is compatible _ with the presence of nodal quasiparticles , provided that the @xmath0-wave component of the order is not too large@xcite  this compatibility was subject of discussions in the past.@xcite    = 3.0 in",
    "let us comment on the influence of quenched disorder arising from dopant impurities . in situations where a symmetry - breaking order is only `` almost ''",
    "static , adding disorder can pin the fluctuations and locally stabilize ordered islands .",
    "the result is a state with static short - range order , not unlike in glassy systems . for stripe order",
    ", this means that domains with segments of horizontal and vertical stripes will coexist , with a checkerboard structure of domain walls.@xcite the electronic qp excitations now move in a static disorder potential , which couples strongly only to the qp near the antinodes , while nodal qp are little affected . as a result , the scattering rate along the normal - state fermi surface will be strongly energy - dependent , and gapless coherent nodal qp will coexist with incoherent antinodal qp .",
    "importantly , the disorder potential acts as a random _ field _ on charge stripes , smearing out any finite - temperature phase transition in the charge sector.@xcite ( this is distinct from the spin sector , where static order at low @xmath16 is still accompanied by a sharp phase transition , as the disorder is of random - mass type . ) at elevated temperatures , signatures of local valence - bond ( i.e. singlet ) formation will be visible below a temperature @xmath69 , and will likely evolve continuously from the high - temperature `` pseudogap '' scale to the low - temperature `` superconducting '' gap .",
    "the described picture of valence - bond order , coexisting with superconductivity at low @xmath16 , nicely ties in with various features of recent experimental data .",
    "( i ) models of coupled spin ladders , arising from bond - centered stripes,@xcite provide an excellent description of the spin dynamics in stripe - ordered la@xmath8ba@xmath9cuo@xmath7.@xcite ( ii ) the short - range charge order seen in stm on underdoped bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3  and ca@xmath4na@xmath5cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2@xcite is bond - centered and locally breaks the lattice rotation symmetry down to c@xmath2 the glassy real - space structure is compatible with impurity - pinned short - range order , where fluctuations in the charge order parameter are primarily of phase instead of amplitude type.@xcite ( iii ) the apparent @xmath1-wave gap of the non - superconducting stripe compound la@xmath8ba@xmath9cuo@xmath7  is naturally explained by @xmath1-wave stripes .",
    "( iv ) to explain the absence of 3d superconductivity in la@xmath8ba@xmath9cuo@xmath7 , `` antiphase superconductivity '' has been proposed.@xcite this is similar to @xmath37 above , and broadly consistent with the picture advocated here .",
    "building on earlier work on charge order in cuprates , we have pointed out that bond - ordered stripe states , possibly of glassy character and coexisting with superconductivity , provide a phenomenological framework which is consistent with many features of recent cuprate experiments .",
    "we believe that this strengthens the case for bond order ( and associated local singlet formation ) to be a common tendency in cuprates , likely relevant also for pseudogap phenomena .",
    "let us note , however , that we think that stripe - like translational symmetry breaking is a phenomenon _ competing _ with superconductivity , i.e. , pairing is suppressed by stripes with spatial long - range order .",
