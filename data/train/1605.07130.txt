    "earth s orbit falls within the boundaries of the habitable zone ( hz ) where a rocky planet can maintain liquid water on its surface , given a co@xmath0-n@xmath0-h@xmath0o atmosphere and some mechanism ( e.g. , plate tectonics ) for recycling these volatiles @xcite .",
    "the inner hz edge is bounded by either the runaway greenhouse effect , in which liquid water evaporates entirely , or the moist greenhouse effect , in which liquid water persists on a planet s surface but the stratosphere becomes wet and water is lost by photodissociation followed by escape of hydrogen to space .",
    "the moist greenhouse effect is difficult to simulate with one - dimensional models that assume a saturated troposphere @xcite , but it does appear in some general circulation models @xcite .",
    "planets farther out in the hz are expected to accumulate dense co@xmath0 atmospheres because of the negative feedback between silicate weathering ( the loss process for atmospheric co@xmath0 ) and surface temperature @xcite . but this feedback loop is ultimately limited by co@xmath0 condensation and rayleigh scattering , which combine to create an outer hz boundary termed the ` maximum greenhouse limit ' @xcite .",
    "a proposed extension of the outer hz boundary by formation of co@xmath0 ice clouds @xcite appears less likely when the ` scattering greenhouse effect ' of these clouds is recomputed using more accurate radiative transfer models , @xcite .",
    "the conventional thinking regarding the hz outer edge may be too optimistic , however , because it fails to account for mass transfer rates of co@xmath0 .",
    "co@xmath0 is released from volcanoes and is consumed by silicate weathering followed by deposition of carbonate sediments @xcite .",
    "these processes are in approximate balance on modern earth , creating a climate that is stable and relatively warm , even if it is sometimes perturbed by glacial - interglacial cycles .",
    "occasional ` snowball earth ' episodes in which the planet is fully glaciated @xcite have been attributed to a variety of complicating factors , including changes in atmospheric o@xmath0 and ch@xmath1 @xcite , as well as limit cycles involving atmospheric co@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "limit cycles  oscillations between ice - free and globally glaciated states  occur in models of the early earth in which volcanic outgassing rates are too low to sustain a co@xmath0-warmed climate @xcite .",
    "several new papers have argued that such limit cycle behavior could be far more prevalent than previously thought @xcite .",
    "depending on the volcanic outgassing rate and host stellar type , some earth - like planets are subject to climatic limit cycles when stellar insolation is low , as it is in the outer parts of a star s hz .",
    "all of these recent studies employed parameterized versions of energy - balance climate models ( ebms ) .",
    "such models include radiative balance between incident stellar and outgoing infrared radiation , along with diffusional heat fluxes between different latitude bands .",
    "these models are useful tools for studying climate variations that occur on time scales of thousands to tens of millions of years .    here",
    "we discuss the possibility that limit cycles could reduce the outer edge of the hz .",
    "we use our own ebm , which implements an updated parameterization of radiative transfer based on 1-d radiative - convective hz calculations @xcite .",
    "our model includes a representation of the carbonate - silicate cycle used by previous studies @xcite , and also expands on previous work to include the effect of co@xmath0 condensation and the impact of seafloor weathering .",
    "these improvements allow us to determine , for the first time , the limit cycle boundaries relative to the conventional liquid water hz for different types of stars .",
    "latitudinal energy balance models ( ebms ) are computationally efficient models that are well - suited to exploring glacial cycling and its influence on climate .",
    "although ebms can be useful with a highly idealized linearization of infrared absorption @xcite , investigation of hz limits requires an ebm with a more sophisticated radiative transfer parameterization @xcite .",
    "however , no previously published ebm has yet been updated to include parameterizations based upon radiative - convective hz model calculations @xcite , which use coefficients derived from the hitran 2008 @xcite and hitemp 2010 @xcite spectroscopic databases to account for additional absorption features of h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 compared to earlier models @xcite .",
    "existing ebms that consider planetary habitability @xcite use an older radiation scheme @xcite , which is based upon a polynomial parameterization of prior radiative - convective calculations @xcite .",
    "these ebm investigations continue to be useful for interpreting exoplanet habitability and guiding more complicated modeling studies toward interesting regions of parameter space , but the lack of up - to - date radiative transfer parameterization in such models can limit their utility when comparing with other recent climate models or interpreting exoplanet observations .",

    "this parameter accounts for the exchange of sensible and latent energy fluxes between the tropics and midlatitudes by adjusting the energy balance equilibrium temperature at each latitude .",
    "@xcite assumed that @xmath22 is proportional to the inverse square of rotation rate , so that a more rapidly ( slowly ) rotating planet will show a decreased ( increased ) tendency toward meridional energy distribution .",
    "this behavior mimics well - known results from general circulation models @xcite while still maintaining the computational efficiency of an ebm .",
    "we focus our study on a model planet with a rotation rate equal to present - day earth , but this assumption does not significantly alter our results",
    ". a more slowly rotating planet would have increased meridional energy transport and would therefore tend toward uniform conditions at all latitudes ; such a limit is analogous to the globally - averaged ebm used by @xcite .",
    "a more rapidly rotating planet would show more extreme variations between equatorial and polar temperatures , but this contrast does not significantly alter the onset of global glaciation and deglaciation events .",
    "sensitivity studies indicate that either of these cases will still exhibit transitions into a limit cycle state at approximately the same value of solar constant , so our assumption of a fixed present - day rotation rate does not necessarily limit the scope of our calculations .",
    "surface albedo @xmath23 is calculated as a weighted sum of the albedos of unfrozen land , unfrozen ocean , and ice coverage at each latitude .",
    "we assume an albedo of 0.2 for unfrozen land , while the albedo of ocean varies as a function of solar zenith angle @xcite .",
    "we also implement a band - dependent ice albedo @xcite that partitions the broadband ice albedo @xmath24 into a visible component , @xmath25 , and a near - infrared component , @xmath26 .",
    "this latter value applies to snow - covered ice , as we discuss further below .",

    "any additional accumulation would result in basal melting of co@xmath0 glaciers and the transport of liquid co@xmath0 to lower latitudes , although none of our simulations in this study reach conditions where @xmath47 .",
    "our latitudinal model can only represent clouds through adjustments to surface albedo , and we assume in our calculations that water clouds cover half of the surface . we have explored the sensitivity of climate to this cloud fraction parameter in a previous study @xcite , which showed that excessive cloud cover can cause a planet to plummet into global glaciation .",
    "we account for the absorption of infrared radiation by clouds by subtracting a fixed amount of 8.5 w m@xmath48 from @xmath11 at each latitude band , following @xcite .",
    "this value was selected by requiring that the ebm should produce a present - day earth temperature of 288 k when the model is initialized with above - freezing initial conditions at @xmath49 .",
    "possible sources of additional warming include co@xmath0 ice clouds , which could warm the surface by up to 15 k by providing additional downward - directed infrared radiation through a scattering greenhouse effect @xcite .",
    "but this is not by itself enough to deglaciate a planet @xcite , and @xcite has shown that these previous calculations may have significantly overestimated the warming from such clouds . by neglecting their radiative impact",
    ", we generate a somewhat pessimistic outer limit on planetary habitability .",
    "co@xmath0 accumulates in our model atmosphere as a result of the carbonate - silicate cycle , which allows a frozen planet to eventually deglaciate .",

    "we use a value of @xmath66 = 0.5 for most of our calculations , which is appropriate for conditions under which the weathering rate is proportional to dissolved [ h@xmath70 .",
    "we also perform a more limited set of calculations for @xmath69 .",
    "seafloor weathering has been neglected in previous calculations of limit cycling , but that is probably an oversight , particularly for planets with smaller amounts of land area than earth .",
    "we consider the effects of seafloor weathering by assuming that the seafloor weathering rate is independent of temperature according to the functional form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a seafloor weathering parameter analogous to @xmath66 in eq .",

    "this parameter @xmath72 may be near unity , but weaker weathering dependence with @xmath74 or lower may also be consistent with some computed histories of early earth @xcite .",
    "we initially assume @xmath75 in our calculations to assess the limit cycle boundary of the hz , and we then consider sensitivity to changes in the seafloor weathering rate .",
    "a critical factor in determining the onset of limit cycles in the hz is the partial pressure of co@xmath0 in soil .",
    "the parameter @xmath76 represents the long - term balance between atmospheric and soil co@xmath0 for present - day earth .",
    "@xcite assumed a value of @xmath77 to represent the pre - industrial co@xmath0 level .",

    "this implies that an abiotic earth should have a higher value of atmospheric pco@xmath0 than today .",
    "to put it another way , if all of life were to suddenly vanish , then pco@xmath0 should increase until the atmospheric and soil ( regolith ) partiial pressures were equal .",
    "if we wish to use our model to test the habitability of abiotic planets , or of inhabited planets that lack vascular land plants , then we should tune the model to an abiotic state .    for a biotic planet like present - day earth",
    ", root respiration by vascular plants increases the value of soil @xmath20co@xmath0 by a factor of 10 to 100 @xcite .",
    "we assume here that the enhancement is a factor of 30 , in which case soil @xmath20co@xmath0 should be approximately @xmath78 bar . for @xmath79 , this implies that land plants accelerate silicate weathering by a factor of @xmath80 . for @xmath69 , the acceleration would be @xmath81 . in either case , an abiotic present - day earth would be warmer than today because land plants would no longer be pumping atmospheric co@xmath0 into soil .",
    "we therefore choose a value of @xmath82 for our calculations of the limit cycle hz boundary .",
    "we first consider an earth - like ( but abiotic ) planet orbiting a g - type star like the sun . at present - day stellar flux ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "our weathering model for abiotic earth with @xmath79 balances at soil @xmath20co@xmath0 = @xmath83 bar and average surface temperature of 296 k , while present earth ( with life ) at a temperature of 288 k has a higher value of soil @xmath20co@xmath0 = @xmath78 bar ( fig .",

    "further outward in the hz at @xmath86 ( the effective solar flux at mars orbit ) , our model and @xcite both predict that the intersection between the weathering rate curve and the greenhouse effect curve falls beneath the freezing point , suggesting that limit cycles should occur .",
    "however , when we assume a value of @xmath69 in our model , limit cycles do not occur at all ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cycles ] , dashed green curve ) . elsewhere @xcite , we have argued that limit cycles are even more likely to have occurred on early mars when the solar flux was significantly lower than today . for early mars ,",
    "though , the greenhouse effect must be supplemented by some absorber other than h@xmath0o or co@xmath0 ; otherwise , even brief recoveries to above - freezing surface temperatures are impossible without outside stimuli , e.g. , impact events @xcite .",

    "this model configuration allows an earth - like planet to deglaciate from a snowball state at any point within the conventional hz due to the accumulation of a dense co@xmath0 atmosphere from the carbonate - silicate cycle",

    "we have argued that volcanic outgassing should balance weathering at the soil @xmath20co@xmath0 , rather than the atmospheric @xmath20co@xmath0 , which results in no limit cycles for earth - like planets in the hz .",

    "by contrast , @xcite found that the outer edge should be completely insensitive to surface albedo because its effect would be completely masked by the overlying dense co@xmath0-rich atmosphere .",
    "however , such dense co@xmath0 atmospheres may not be long - lived when carbonate - silicate weathering is included .",
    "the rare earth hypothesis @xcite suggests that complex life may be uncommon in the universe even if simple life is widespread .",
    "although many arguments have been raised against this idea @xcite , limit cycling in parts of the conventional hz , for planets with relatively low outgassing rates , presents problems for both simple and complex life .",
    "photosynthetic algae and cyanobacteria would go extinct on a ` hard snowball ' planet with sea - ice thicknesses of a kilometer or more , unless illuminated refugia were available .",
    "both types of organisms survived the neoproterozoic snowball earth episodes @xcite , so some types of refugia must have existed .",
    "models with either thin ice @xcite or open water @xcite near the equator may provide the explanation .",
    "but multicellular land life would be highly challenged by this type of climatic behavior which , fortunately , has not occurred since the late precambrian .",
    "it follows that animal life , and thus intelligent life , may not be able to evolve on planets with low incident stellar flux and a low volcanic outgassing rate , even if they are within the conventional hz .",
    "the presence of a limit cycle boundary depends critically upon the assumed volcanic outgassing rate , and planets with a co@xmath0 outgassing rate similar to today may not experience limit cycles at all .",
    "@xcite suggest that low outgassing rates may be expected for earth - like planets orbiting old stars , which would make such planets more prone to limit cycles .",
    "one should exercise caution in accepting this conclusion , as it is based on their assumption that the co@xmath0 outgassing rate declines monotonically with time on an earth - like planet as its interior cools .",
    "other authors @xcite have suggested that earth s co@xmath0 outgassing rate actually _ increased _ with time during the first half of its history as the growth of continents allowed greater storage of carbonate rocks and greater recycling of co@xmath0 through weathering , carbonate deposition , and sediment subduction .",
    "if the co@xmath0 outgassing rate of present - day earth is anomalously large compared to typical terrestrial planets , then earth might be uncommon in its ability to sustain a stable warm climate .",
    "conversely , planets more massive than earth ( known as super - earths ) may exhibit higher rates of volcanism than earth today , although the dependence of plate tectonics on planetary mass remains unclear @xcite .",
    "so , it is at least conceivable that super - earths in the outer parts of the hz would be better abodes for complex life than would true earth analogs .",
    "the actual dependence of the silicate weathering rate on @xmath20co@xmath0 is unknown for abiotic planets .",
    "we have assumed @xmath79 , which matches the behavior of the h@xmath96 concentration in rainwater ; however , the actual exponent could range from 0.25 to 1 @xcite . the weathering rate on modern earth",
    "is sometimes argued to have zero direct dependence on atmospheric co@xmath0 @xcite , because @xmath20co@xmath0 in soils is decoupled from atmospheric @xmath20co@xmath0 by the presence of vascular plants , which pump up soil co@xmath0 by way of root respiration .",
    "plants also generate humic acids which accelerate weathering , again without any direct relation to atmospheric @xmath20co@xmath0 .",
    "consequently , @xcite argued that the emergence of land life on a planet should stabilize its climate against limit cycles . but",
    "this inference is incorrect .",
    "land plants accelerate weathering @xcite by anywhere from a factor of 2 - 3 @xcite to a factor of 10 - 100 or more @xcite compared to an abiotic environment .",
    "( we assume a weathering acceleration factor in the range of 2.8 - 5.5 , as dicussed above . )",
    "lichens , algae , and other microorganisms also secrete acids that accelerate weathering @xcite , so the emergence of life on a planet in the outer , limit - cycling region of the hz should only help to pull down atmospheric co@xmath0 , making the planet even more subject to global glaciation .",
    "global glaciation would kill any plants , allowing atmospheric co@xmath0 to again accumulate , and so cycling should re - initiate at a rate that would depend on whether the plants themselves were able to regenerate . life",
    "( as we know it ) would not stabilize a planet s climate against limit cycling , but it might create a more complex , biologically mediated form of limit cycling .    what do these arguments imply about the prevalence of animal life and the possible evolution of intelligent life ?",
    "the limit cycle region of the hz depends upon the assumed , and somewhat uncertain , behavior of the volcanic outgassing and seafloor weathering rates for abiotic planets . for planets around k and m stars",
    ", this does not appear to pose a problem , but for some types of stars , the outlook is less optimistic . according to our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : hz ] , the hz around f stars can be nearly eliminated if the volcanic outgassing rate is @xmath97 or less .",
    "f stars also have relatively short main sequence lifetimes , and they brighten quickly as they age , which limits the time available for biological evolution . meanwhile , although planets around k and m stars may avoid this problem , they may have other issues that could preclude their habitability .",
    "if @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are correct , nearly all planets around late k and m stars should experience drastic pre - main - sequence water loss .",
    "early k stars and late g stars avoid both of these problems .",
    "so , there are still many stars that could host planets with complex life . but",
    "any search for such life should be concentrated on planets around late g- to early k - type stars , which are only a subset of the planets that might support simple life .",
    "we have calculated the limit cycle boundary of the habitable zone as a function of stellar type and co@xmath0 outgassing rate .",
    "earth - like planets with volcanic outgassing rates similar to today are able to maintain stable climates across the entire range of the hz , regardless of stellar type . but",
    "planets with lower volcanic outgassing rates or significant seafloor weathering rates should experience limit cycles , with punctuated episodes of warm conditions followed by extended glacial periods .",
    "f star planets are the most prone to this behavior as a result of increased susceptibility to ice - albedo feedback .",
    "planets orbiting late k and m stars avoid limit cycles because of reduced ice - albedo feedback , but they may suffer from water loss during their formation .",
    "thus , systems with the greatest potential for habitability are those around late g and early k type stars .",
    "the net outgassing rate of co@xmath0 and partial pressure of @xmath98 in soil are key parameters in understanding the habitability of an earth - like planet . if earth has maintained a net co@xmath0 outgassing rate at or above its current value for its entire history , then it may never have been prone to limit cycles at any point in time . by extension ,",
    "if earth s outgassing rate is typical for other terrestrial planets , then limit cycles may not pose a problem for habitability at all .",
    "likewise , we expect that an abiotic planet would accumulate more atmospheric co@xmath0 than its inhabited counterpart , which would lead us to expect that few planets , if any , should reside in limit cycles .",
    "however , we should expect a diversity of exoplanet environments to exist , and we can not rule out the possibility that earth s co@xmath0 inventory is atypical . in the search for habitable worlds , we should at least consider the possibility that some earth - like planets may exhibit lower net outgassing rates than today , which could develop limit cycles and preclude the development of complex life .",
