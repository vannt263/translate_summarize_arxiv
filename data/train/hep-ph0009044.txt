    "i was asked by art mcdonald to give one of the opening talks on the subject `` neutrino astrophysics in the 20th century and beyond . ''",
    "feeling very honored , i readily accepted .",
    "but , as i started thinking about what i should say to so many knowledgeable friends , i got really worried .",
    "i realized that it would be impossible in twenty - five minutes to discuss intelligently all of neutrino astrophysics of the 20th century .",
    "there is just too much important material to cover even if i spoke very fast , unintelligibly fast , and even if i did not say anything about our goals for the future .",
    "so , i decided to limit my remarks to two specific topics : solar neutrinos and extragalactic neutrinos .",
    "i will not say anything about the enormous achievements in the prediction and detection of supernova neutrinos and in the calculations of neutrino cooling processes for stars that are not exploding .",
    "i will also not discuss the role of neutrinos in big bang nucleosynthesis nor in cosmology .",
    "there are lots of grand things to say about these subjects , and many other topics in neutrino astrophysics , but i will not discuss them today .",
    "i will take a somewhat historical approach and emphasize those aspects of the development of our subject which may help guide our thinking about what we should do in the future .",
    "i will begin with solar neutrinos and then switch abruptly to extragalactic neutrinos .",
    "i want to begin by paying tribute to two of the great scientists and pioneers of neutrino astrophysics , ray davis and bruno pontecorvo .",
    "bruno first suggested using chlorine as a detector of neutrinos in a chalk river report written in 1946 .",
    "ray followed bruno s suggestion and the careful unpublished feasibility study of louie alvarez . using with care and skill",
    "a chlorine detector and reactor neutrinos , ray showed in 1955 - 1958 that @xmath0 and @xmath1 were different .",
    "about a decade later , ray first detected solar neutrinos , laying the foundation for the studies we shall hear about today .    in 1967 , one year before the first results of ray s chlorine solar neutrino experiment were announced , bruno published a prophetic paper entitled : ` neutrino experiments and the problem of conservation of leptonic charge ' [ zh .",
    "53 , 1717 ( 1967 ) ] . in this paper , bruno suggested many different experiments that could test whether leptonic charge was conserved .",
    "the grandchildren of most of these experiments are being discussed in this conference , neutrino 2000 .",
    "bruno included a short section in his paper that he called ` oscillations and astronomy . ' in this section , bruno wrote : `` from the point of view of detection possibilities , an ideal object is the sun , '' what a wonderfully contemporary statement !",
    "bruno , like most particle physicists of the 1960 s and perhaps 1970 s and 1980 s , did not believe astrophysical calculations could be reliable .",
    "he wrote in this same section on oscillations and astronomy : `` unfortunately , the weight of the various thermonuclear reactions in the sun , and the central temperature of the sun are insufficiently well known in order to allow a useful comparison of expected and observed solar neutrinos , from the point of view of this article . ''",
    "[ this was 30 years before the precise confirmation of the standard solar model by helioseismology . ] to support his claim , bruno referenced only his 1946 chalk river report , which mentioned the sun in just two sentences .",
    "bruno did cite our calculations of the solar neutrino fluxes elsewhere in his 1967 paper , but they seem not to have affected his thinking .",
    "-.27 in -.3 in    what can we learn from this bit of history ?",
    "when ray and i wrote our prl papers arguing that a chlorine detector of 600 tons could observe solar neutrinos , we never discussed the possibility of using neutrinos to learn about particle physics .",
    "the only motivation we gave was `` ... to see into the interior of a star and thus verify directly the hypothesis of nuclear energy generation in stars . ''",
    "[ prl 12 , 300 ( 1964 ) ]",
    ".    why did we not discuss using neutrinos for particle physics ?",
    "frankly , because we never thought about it . and",
    "even if we had , we would have known better than to mention it to our particle physics friends .",
    "bruno had the insight and the vision and indeed the courage to argue that astronomical neutrinos could potentially give us unique information about neutrino characteristics .",
    "his paper is all the more remarkable because it was published a year before the first results of the chlorine experiment showed that the rate ray observed was less than our calculated rate .",
    "we learn from these events that pioneering experiments can lead to important results in areas that are unanticipated",
    ". we will come back to this conclusion at the end of this talk .",
    "figure  [ fig : nuspectrum ] shows the calculated solar neutrino spectrum predicted by the standard solar model .",
    "the percentage errors are the calculated @xmath2 uncertainties in the predicted fluxes , based upon the published errors of the measured quantities and on many calculations of standard solar models . as you will hear from the talks in the later parts of this morning session , the total intensities and the energy spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuspectrum ] are now widely used to interpret , and indeed to plan , solar neutrino experiments such as those discussed in today s sessions : chlorine , super - kamiokande , sno , sage , gallex , gno , and borexino .",
    "figure  [ fig : theoryvsexp ] compares the calculated versus the measured rates for the six solar neutrino experiments for which results have been reported .",
    "assuming nothing happens to the neutrinos after they are created , the measured rates range from @xmath3% @xmath4% of the calculated rate ( for chlorine ) to @xmath5% @xmath6% .",
    "as is now well known , the observed rates can not be fit ( at a c.l . of about 99% ) with any linear combination of undistorted solar neutrino energy spectra .",
    "today we know that there are three reasons that the calculations of solar neutrino fluxes are robust : 1 ) the availability of precision measurements and precision calculations of input data that have been gradually refined over four decades ; 2 ) the intimate connection between neutrino fluxes and the measured solar luminosity ; and 3 ) the measurement of the helioseismological frequencies of the solar pressure - mode ( @xmath7-mode ) eigenfrequencies .",
    "-.48 in -.5 in    could the solar model calculations be wrong by enough to explain the discrepancies between predictions and measurements shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theoryvsexp ] ?",
    "helioseismology , which confirms predictions of the standard solar model to high precision , suggests that the answer is `` no . ''",
    "figure  [ fig : diffmodelbest ] shows the fractional differences between the most accurate available sound speeds measured by helioseismology and sound speeds calculated with our best solar model ( with no free parameters ) .",
    "the horizontal line corresponds to the hypothetical case in which the model predictions exactly match the observed values .",
    "the rms fractional difference between the calculated and the measured sound speeds is @xmath8 for the entire region over which the sound speeds are measured , @xmath9 . in the solar core , @xmath10 ( in which about @xmath11% of the solar energy and neutrino flux is produced in a standard model )",
    ", the rms fractional difference between measured and calculated sound speeds is @xmath12 .",
    "-.4 in    the arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffmodelbest ] shows how different the solar model sound speeds would have to be from the observed sound speeds if one wanted to use solar physics to reduce the @xmath13be neutrino flux .",
    "the position of the arrow is fixed by artificially reducing the predicted @xmath13be neutrino flux that is not observed in the gallium experiments , sage and gallex plus gno ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : theoryvsexp ] ) .",
    "if the @xmath14 neutrinos are present .",
    "remember , we believe we can calculate the @xmath14 flux to @xmath15% .",
    "the discrepancy with the hypothetical new solar physics was estimated by using the temperature dependence of the @xmath13be neutrino flux ( @xmath16 ) and the sound speeds ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the agreement with the hypothetical solar physics is more than @xmath18 times worse than the agreement with the standard model physics .",
    "figure  [ fig : diffmodelbest ] has contributed to the consensus view that the experimental results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theoryvsexp ] require new particle physics for their explanation .",
    "i want now to look back and then look ahead .",
    "i will begin by giving my view of the principal accomplishments of solar neutrino research to date ( sect .",
    "[ subsubsec : achievements ] ) .",
    "then i will discuss two of the expected highlights of the next decade of solar neutrino research , the measurement of the neutral current to charge current ratio for @xmath19b neutrinos ( ( sect .",
    "[ subsubsec : doubleratio ] ) and the detection of solar neutrinos with energies less than 1 mev ( ( sect .",
    "[ subsubsec : below1mev ] ) .",
    "what are the principal achievements of the first four decades of solar neutrino research ?",
    "i give below my personal list of the ` top three achievements . '",
    "@xmath20 * solar neutrinos have been detected . *",
    "the chlorine , kamiokande , super - kamiokande , gallex , sage , gno , and sno experiments have all measured solar neutrino events .",
    "this is the most important achievement .",
    "the detection of solar neutrinos shows empirically that the sun shines by the fusion of light elements .",
    "@xmath20 * evidence for new physics has been found .",
    "* for more than thirty years , beginning with the fact that ray s first measurements in 1968 indicated a flux lower than the standard model predictions , we have had evidence for new physics in the solar neutrino arena .",
    "this evidence has steadily deepened as new solar neutrino experiments have confirmed and extended the neutrino discrepancies and helioseismology has confirmed the standard solar model .",
    "the fact that neutrino oscillations have now been observed in atmospheric neutrino phenomena further strengthens the case that oscillations occur for solar neutrinos .",
    "we are still looking for a ` smoking gun ' single effect that shows up in just one solar neutrino experiment , rather than combining the results of two or more different experiments .",
    "i will discuss some possibilities below .",
    "@xmath20 * neutrino fluxes and energy spectra are approximately as predicted by the standard solar model .",
    "* if you had told me in 1964 that six solar neutrino experiments would give results within a factor of three of the predicted standard model results , i would have been astonished and delighted .",
    "this is especially so considering that the crucial @xmath19b neutrino flux depends upon the 25th power of the central temperature of the sun .",
    "this agreement exists without making any corrections for neutrino oscillations .",
    "if we correct the observed solar neutrino event rates for the effects of neutrino oscillations using the six currently allowed two - neutrino oscillation scenarios , the inferred @xmath19b neutrino flux at the source is rather close to the best - estimate predicted flux . at the 99% cl , one infers ( see hep - ph/9911248 ) :    @xmath21    which is a slightly tighter range than the @xmath22 prediction of the standard solar model .",
    "figure  [ fig : double ] shows the predictions of the currently allowed neutrino oscillation solutions for the double ratio , [ nc]/[cc ] , of neutral current to charged current event rates in the deuterium detector sno .",
    "art mcdonald will describe later this morning the experimental characteristics of this great observatory and outline for us the extensive program of sno measurements .",
    "the important message of fig .",
    "[ fig : double ] is that all of the currently allowed oscillation solutions for active neutrinos predict a value for the double ratio that is different from the no oscillation value of 1.0 by at least nine times the estimated non - statistical measurement uncertainty .",
    "we all eagerly look forward to this crucial and decisive measurement .",
    "more than @xmath23% of the calculated standard model solar neutrino flux lies below @xmath24 mev .",
    "the rare @xmath19b neutrino flux is the only solar neutrino source for which measurements of the energy have been made , but @xmath19b neutrinos constitute a fraction of less than @xmath25 of the total solar neutrino flux .",
    "the great challenge of solar neutrino astronomy is to measure neutrino fluxes below @xmath24 mev .",
    "we must develop experiments that will measure the @xmath13be neutrinos ( energy of @xmath26 mev ) and the fundamental @xmath7-@xmath7 neutrinos ( @xmath27 mev ) .",
    "a number of promising possibilities were discussed at the lownu workshop that preceded this conference .",
    "the borexino observatory , which can detect @xmath28 scattering , is the only approved solar neutrino experiment which can measure energies less than @xmath24 mev .",
    "the @xmath7-@xmath7 neutrinos are overwhelmingly the most abundant source of solar neutrinos , carrying about @xmath29% of the total flux according to the standard solar model .",
    "the @xmath13be neutrinos constitute about @xmath30% of the total standard model flux .",
    "we want to test and to understand neutrino oscillations with high precision using solar neutrino sources .",
    "to do so , we have to measure the neutrino - electron scattering rate with @xmath13be neutrinos , as will be done with the borexino experiment , and also the cc ( neutrino - absorption ) rate with @xmath13be neutrinos ( no approved experiment ) . with a neutrino line",
    "as provided by @xmath13be electron - capture in the sun , unique and unambiguous tests of neutrino oscillation models can be carried out if one measures both the charged - current and the neutral current reaction rates .",
    "i believe that we have calculated the flux of @xmath7-@xmath7 neutrinos produced in the sun to an accuracy of @xmath15% .",
    "this belief should be tested experimentally .",
    "unfortunately , we do not yet have a direct measurement of this flux .",
    "the gallium experiments only tell us the rate of capture of all neutrinos with energies above @xmath31 mev .",
    "the most urgent need for solar neutrino research is to develop a practical experiment to measure directly the @xmath7-@xmath7 neutrino flux and the energy spectrum of electrons produced by weak interactions with @xmath7-@xmath7 neutrinos .",
    "such an experiment can be used to test the precise and fundamental standard solar model prediction of the neutrino flux .",
    "moreover , the currently favored neutrino oscillation solutions all predict a strong influence of oscillations on the low - energy flux of @xmath0 .",
    "-.6 in    figure  [ fig : survival ] shows the calculated neutrino survival probability as a function of energy for three global best - fit msw oscillation solutions .",
    "you can see directly from this figure why we need accurate measurements for the @xmath7-@xmath7 and @xmath13be neutrinos .",
    "the currently favored solutions exhibit their most characteristic and strongly energy dependent features below @xmath24 mev . naturally ,",
    "all of the solutions give similar predictions in the energy region , @xmath32 mev , where the kamiokande and super - kamiokande data are best .",
    "the survival probability shows a strong change with energy below @xmath24 mev for all the solutions , whereas in the region above @xmath33 mev ( accessible to super - kamiokande and to sno ) the energy dependence of the survival probability is at best modest .",
    "the @xmath7-@xmath7 neutrinos are the gold ring of solar neutrino astronomy .",
    "their measurement will constitute a simultaneous and critical test of stellar evolution theory and of neutrino oscillation solutions .",
    "experimentalists often like to describe the power of their experiments in terms of the expected or observed number of events per year and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the distance between the accelerator and the detector and @xmath36 is the beam energy .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 determines , together with the square of the mass difference , the survival probability for vacuum neutrino oscillations .",
    "more generally , @xmath34 represents the time of flight in the rest frame of the particle , the time for rare events to occur .",
    "figure  [ fig : lovere ] shows the extraordinary sensitivity to neutrino oscillation of experiments like antares , baikal , icecube , and nestor that can detect neutrinos from distant extragalactic sources .",
    "the accelerator experiments that will be discussed at neutrino 2000 lie in the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : lovere ] , @xmath37 km / gev .",
    "solar neutrino experiments like super - kamiokande , sno , and borexino can reach to @xmath38 km / gev and , for the lower energy experiments , even @xmath39 km / gev .",
    "extragalactic sources such as gamma - ray - bursts ( grbs ) have such a long baseline ( @xmath40 lyrs ) that the new generation of extragalactic experiments , antares , baikal , icecube , and nestor will extend to the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : lovere ] , to @xmath41  km / gev .",
    "i want to say a few words about the possibilities for detecting grb neutrinos , which will be discussed in more detail in these proceedings by eli waxman .",
    "i believe that grbs offer the best chance for detecting extragalactic neutrinos among all the known sources of astronomical photons .",
    "the phenomenology of the photons observed from gamma - ray bursts is now relatively well understood .",
    "many different types of observations have been carried out and the results are well summarized by the expanding fireball model . using this model , one can work out the flux of neutrinos from shocks .",
    "figure  [ fig : jetbound ] shows the neutrino energy spectra that waxman and i have estimated to be produced by grbs , both from the direct burst ( energies @xmath42 gev ) and from the afterglow ( energies @xmath43 gev to @xmath44 gev ) .",
    "the observed population of grbs should give rise to @xmath45 events per @xmath46 per year from neutrinos with characteristic energies of order @xmath47 ev .",
    "we shall hear on the last day of this conference that the calculated grb flux may be detectable in antares , icecube , or nestor .",
    "the fundamental assumption used in calculating the grb neutrino flux is that grbs produce the observed flux of high - energy cosmic rays , an assumption for which eli waxman has provided a strong plausibility argument .",
    "grbs occur at modest to large redshifts .",
    "we know the time of the explosion to an accuracy @xmath45 sec ( from the gamma rays ) .",
    "therefore , grbs can be used to test special relativity to an accuracy of @xmath24 part in @xmath48 and to test the weak equivalence principle to an accuracy of @xmath24 part in @xmath49 .",
    "if special relativity is right , the photons and the neutrinos should arrive at the same time ( to an accuracy of about @xmath50 sec , the duration of the burst ) . if the weak equivalence principle is valid , the arrival times of neutrinos ( which traverse significant gravitational potentials ) from distant sources should be independent of neutrino flavor .",
    "grbs can also be used to probe the weak interactions to an extraordinary level of precision .",
    "gamma - ray bursts are expected to produce only @xmath0 and @xmath51 .",
    "the large area detectors of extragalactic neutrinos are in principle sensitive to vacuum neutrino oscillations with mass differences as small as @xmath52  ( from @xmath53 ) .",
    "not everything is encouraging in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetbound ] .",
    "the figure also shows the upper limit that is allowed for astrophysical neutrino production from @xmath54 interactions on high energy protons .",
    "the upper limit is established by using the observed cosmic ray flux of high energy protons .",
    "prior to the recognition of this limit a number of authors had suggested much more optimistic models ( also shown in the figure ) , that were normalized by fitting @xmath55 decay to the observed gamma - ray background .",
    "it seems to me that we have three principal goals for this next decade .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * determine the mixing angles and mass differences that are important for solar neutrino phenomena .",
    "* test precisely stellar evolution by observing @xmath14 and @xmath13be neutrinos , and by determining the total flux of @xmath19b neutrinos .",

    "they are very different . from photon studies , we know more observationally about the sun than about any other astronomical source , certainly much more than about the mysterious grbs .",
    "moreover the sun is in the simplest stage of stellar evolution , in quasi - static equilibrium with a characteristic time scale for evolution of @xmath56 yr ( @xmath48 s ) .",
    "we do not even know the energy source of grbs .",
    "we do know that grbs are far from equilibrium , evolving explosively on a time scale of order @xmath57 s.    we want to do extragalactic neutrino astronomy because it is truly an exploration of the universe .",
    "we do solar neutrino astronomy to test fundamental theories of physics and astronomy .",
    "but , perhaps solar neutrino research and extragalactic neutrino research may in the end share a fundamental characteristic : surprise .",
    "remember , that we undertook solar neutrino research to test stellar evolution and unexpectedly ( at least for everybody except bruno pontecorvo ) we found evidence for new neutrino physics .    in a sense",
    ", we are returning to our original goal in neutrino astronomy , but by a round - about path .",
    "we must first understand neutrino oscillation phenomena in order to be able to use solar neutrino observations to test precisely the theory of stellar evolution , our original goal .",
    "perhaps with extragalactic astronomy we will participate in a similar cycle of astronomical exploration and physical clarification .",
