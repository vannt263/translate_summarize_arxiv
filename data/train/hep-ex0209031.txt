    "one of the distinctive features of qcd as a non - abelian gauge theory is the interaction of quarks and gluons , which predicts the existence of other types of hadrons with explicit gluonic degrees of freedom  glueballs and hybrids .",
    "the indirect evidence for gluon - gluon interactions has been obtained at high energies .",
    "however , glueballs , the bound states of gluons , and hybrids predicted by qcd , have not been confirmed yet .",
    "therefore , the observation of glueballs and hybrids is , to some extent , a direct test of qcd , and the study of the glueball and hybrid spectroscopy , together with the meson and baryon spectroscopy will be a good laboratory for the study of the strong interactions in the strongly coupled non - perturbative regime .",
    "many qcd - based models and calculations , for example , bag models @xcite , flux - tube models @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite and lattice qcd @xcite are developed to make predictions to the properties of glueballs and hybrids . of them , lattice qcd is considered as the most relevant since it originated from the first principle of qcd .    according to the calculations of different lattice qcd groups@xcite , the lightest glueball is found to be a @xmath3 state with the mass in the region of 1.5 - 1.7 gev , while the next lightest glueball is a @xmath4 with the mass around 2.3gev .",
