    "of an efficient controller for nonlinear systems subjected to parametric and nonparametric uncertainties has always been a challenging task . among many other approaches , adaptive control and robust control",
    "are the two popular control strategies that researchers have extensively employed while dealing with uncertain nonlinear systems . in general , adaptive control uses predefined parameter adaptation laws and equivalence principle based control law which adjusts the parameters of the controller on the fly according to the pertaining uncertainties @xcite .",
    "however , this approach has poor transient performance and online calculation of the unknown system parameters and controller gains for complex systems is computationally intensive @xcite .",
    "whereas , robust control aims at tackling the uncertainties of the system within an uncertainty bound defined a priori .",
    "it reduces computation complexity to a great extent for complex systems compared to adaptive control as exclusive online estimation of uncertain parameters is not required @xcite . however , nominal modelling of the uncertainties is necessary to decide upon their bounds , which is not always possible .",
    "again , to increase the operating region of the controller , often higher uncertainty bounds are assumed . this in turn leads to problems like higher controller gain and consequent possibility of chattering for the switching law based robust controller like sliding mode control ( smc ) .",
    "this in effect reduces controller accuracy @xcite .",
    "higher order sliding mode @xcite can alleviate the chattering problem but prerequisite of uncertainty bound still exists .    time - delayed control ( tdc ) is utilized in @xcite to implement state derivative feedback for enhancing stability margin of siso linear time invariant ( lti ) systems . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , tdc is used to provide robustness against uncertainties . in this process , all the uncertain terms are represented by a single function which is then approximated using control input and state information of the immediate past time instant .",
    "the advantage of this robust control approach in uncertain systems is that it reduces the burden of tedious modelling of complex system to a great extent . in spite of this ,",
    "the unattended approximation error , commonly termed as time - delayed error ( tde ) causes detrimental effect to the performance of the closed system and its stability . in this front",
    ", a few work have been carried out to tackle tde which includes internal model @xcite , gradient estimator @xcite , ideal velocity feedback @xcite , nonlinear damping @xcite and sliding mode based approach @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the stability of the closed loop system @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , depends on the boundedness of tde as shown in @xcite .",
    "this method approximates the continuous time closed loop system in a discrete form without considering the effect of discretization error .",
    "again , the stability criterion mentioned in @xcite restricts the allowable range of perturbation and thus limits controller working range .",
    "stability of the system in @xcite is established in frequency domain , which makes the approach inapplicable to the nonlinear systems .",
    "moreover , the controllers designed in @xcite , and @xcite , @xcite require nominal modelling and upper bound of the tde respectively which is not always possible in practical circumstances .",
    "also , to the best knowledge of the authors , controller design issues such as selection of controller gains and sampling interval to achieve efficient performance is still an open problem .",
    "in contrast to tdc , works reported in @xcite-@xcite use low pass filter to approximate the unknown uncertainties and disturbances . however , frequency range of system dynamics and external disturbances are required to determine the time constant of the filter . furthermore , the order of the low pass filter needs to be adjusted according to order of the disturbance to maintain stability of the controller .    considering the individual limitations of adaptive and robust control , recently global research",
    "is reoriented towards adaptive - robust control ( arc ) where switching gain of the controller is adjusted online .",
    "the series of publications @xcite , @xcite-@xcite regarding arc , estimates the uncertain terms online based on predefined projection function , but predefined bound on uncertainties is still a requirement .",
    "the work reported in @xcite , @xcite attempts to estimate the maximum uncertainty bound but the integral adaptive law makes the controller susceptible to very high switching gain and consequent chattering @xcite . the adaptive sliding mode control ( asmc )",
    "as presented in @xcite-@xcite proposed two laws for the switching gain to adapt itself online according to the incurred error . in the first adaptive law ,",
    "the switching gain decreases or increases depending on a predefined threshold value .",
    "however , until the threshold value is achieved , the switching gain may still be increasing ( resp .",
    "decreasing ) even if tracking error decreases ( resp .",
    "increases ) and thus creates overestimation ( resp .",
    "underestimation ) problem of switching gain @xcite . moreover , to decide the threshold value the maximum bound of the uncertainty is required . for the second adaptive law ,",
    "the threshold value changes online according to switching gain .",
    "yet , nominal model of the uncertainties is needed for defining the control law .",
    "this limits the adaptive nature of the control law and applicability of the controller .      in this paper ,",
    "three specific related problems on tdc have been dealt with and the corresponding solutions to the same which are also the contributions of this paper are summarized below :    * _ * problem 1 : * the stability analysis of tdc , as provided in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , approximates the continuous time system in discrete time domain without considering the effects of discretization error . again , choice of the delay time and its relation with the controller gains is still an open problem . _",
    "+ in this paper , a new stability analysis for tdc , based on the lyapunov - krasvoskii method , is provided in continuous time domain . furthermore , through the proposed stability approach , a relation between the sampling interval and controller gain is established . * _ * problem 2 : * the tdc reported in ( @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , velocity and acceleration feedback are necessary to compute the control law . while in @xcite , only velocity feedback is required and acceleration term is approximated numerically using time delay . however , in many applications velocity and acceleration feedback are not available explicitly and numerical approximation of these terms invokes measurement error . _",
    "+ as a second contribution of this paper , filtered time - delayed control ( f - tdc ) control law is formulated where only position feedback is sufficient while velocity and acceleration terms are estimated using past and present position information to curb the effect measurement error .",
    "stability analysis of the proposed f - tdc is provided which also maintains the relation between controller gains and sampling interval . * _ * problem 3 : * robustness property against tde is essential to achieve good tracking accuracy .",
    "the robust controllers reported in literature , either requires nominal model of the uncertainties ( @xcite-@xcite ) or its predefined bound ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "so , it is required to devise a control law which would avoid any prior knowledge of the uncertainties while providing robustness against tde . _",
    "+ towards the last contribution of this article , an adaptive - robust control strategy , time - delayed adaptive robust control ( tarc ) has been formulated for a class of uncertain euler - lagrange systems .",
    "the proposed control law approximates uncertainties by time - delayed logic and provides robustness against the tde , arising from time - delayed logic based estimation , by switching control .",
    "the novel adaptive law , presented here , aims at overcoming the overestimation - underestimation problem of the switching gain without any prior knowledge of uncertainties .",
    "the proposed adaptive law provides flexibility to the control designer to select any suitable error function according to the application requirement while maintaining similar system stability notion .    as a proof of concept , experimental validation of the proposed control methodology",
    "is provided using the `` pioneer-3 '' nonholonomic wmr in comparison to tdc @xcite and asmc @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : a new stability analysis of tdc along with its design issues is first discussed in section ii .",
    "this is followed by the proposed adaptive - robust control methodology and its detail analysis . section iii presents the experimental results of the proposed controller and its comparison with tdc and asmc .",
    "section iv concludes the entire work .",

    "further , ( [ error dyn delayed 2 ] ) can be written in state space form as , @xmath29 where , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 . noting that , @xmath33 , where the derivative inside the integral is with respect to @xmath34 , the error dynamics ( [ new err dyn 1 ] ) is modified as , @xmath35    where , @xmath36 . it is assumed that the choice controller gains @xmath25 and @xmath26 makes @xmath37 hurwitz which is always possible .",
    "also , it is assumed that the unknown uncertainties are bounded . in this paper ,",
    "a new stability criterion , based on the lyapunov - krasvoskii method , is presented through theorem 1 which addresses the issues defined in problem 1 .    the system ( [ sys new ] ) employing the control input ( [ input ] ) , having auxiliary control input ( [ aux ] ) is uub if the controller gains and delay time is selected such that the following condition holds : @xmath38    where , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are scalar , and @xmath42 is the solution of the lyapunov equation @xmath43 for some @xmath44 .",

    "<S> in this paper , the tracking control problem of a class of euler - lagrange systems subjected to unknown uncertainties is addressed and an adaptive - robust control strategy , christened as time - delayed adaptive robust control ( tarc ) is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed control strategy approximates the unknown dynamics through time - delayed logic , and the switching logic provides robustness against the approximation error . </S>",
    "<S> the novel adaptation law for the switching gain , in contrast to the conventional adaptive - robust control methodologies , does not require either nominal modelling or predefined bounds of the uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> also , the proposed adaptive law circumvents the overestimation - underestimation problem of switching gain . </S>",
    "<S> the state derivatives in the proposed control law is estimated from past data of the state to alleviate the measurement error when state derivatives are not available directly . moreover , a new stability notion for time - delayed control is proposed which in turn provides a selection criterion for controller gain and sampling interval . </S>",
    "<S> experimental result of the proposed methodology using a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot ( wmr ) is presented and improved tracking accuracy of the proposed control law is noted compared to time - delayed control and adaptive sliding mode control .    </S>",
