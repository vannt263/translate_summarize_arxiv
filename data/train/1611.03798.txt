    "magnetic flux plays a crucial role in the compactification of field theories and string theories in several ways .",
    "first of all , it leads to a multiplicity of fermion zero modes , which can be used to explain the number of quark - lepton generations @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is an important source of supersymmetry breaking @xcite and , together with a non - perturbative superpotential , it can stabilize the compact dimensions @xcite consistent with four - dimensional minkowski or de sitter vacua @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the effect of flux on quantum corrections .",
    "we consider the simplest case , a six - dimensional ( 6d ) gauge theory with @xmath0 supersymmetry compactified to four dimensions ( 4d ) on a torus @xmath1 .",
    "following techniques developed in @xcite , we start from the 6d lagrangian written in terms of 4d chiral and vector superfields . before we consider the constant magnetic flux background we derive a supersymmetric effective action for the kaluza - klein ( kk ) states of a 6d abelian gauge theory and show how the kk excitations of the vector multiplet obtain their masses from a supersymmetric stckelberg mechanism . in the flux background",
    "the covariant derivatives of the charged fields satisfy a harmonic oscillator algebra @xcite , which allows to encode their dynamics in the compact dimensions via ladder operators . applying this harmonic oscillator analogy to the full superfields",
    "we derive a 4d supersymmetric effective action that incorporates the complete tower of charged states .",
    "even though the explicit form of the field profiles in the flux background is known @xcite our analysis only uses their orthonormality .",
    "the 4d effective action contains the masses of all charged fields , which are reminiscent of landau levels , as well as their interactions , see also @xcite .",
    "a similar treatment is carried out for non - abelian flux where also components of the gauge field are charged and affected by the flux .",
    "internal magnetic fields were largely discussed in the string literature , see e.g. @xcite , starting with @xcite , followed by its t - dual interpretation of d - branes at angles @xcite .",
    "global string theory models of this type with 4d supersymmetry or completely broken supersymmetry were constructed in @xcite . in the case where 4d supersymmetry is broken by the internal magnetic flux",
    ", however , a ns - ns tadpole appears at the disk level , which signals a change of the ground state of the theory ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", most quantum corrections at the string theory level can not be reliably computed . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective field theory action we construct in this paper is adapted to compute quantum corrections , as we will exemplify in the following .",
    "our main interest concerns the effect of flux on the quantum corrections to massless scalar particles . without flux",
    "it is well - known that the mass of wilson lines , i.e.  the scalar zero modes associated with the higher - dimensional gauge field , are protected from quadratic divergences by the invariance under a discrete shift symmetry , a consequence of the higher - dimensional gauge invariance on the torus @xcite . for 6d gauge theories the one - loop effective",
    "potential has been explicitly computed in @xcite , and it has been shown that the squared mass of the wilson line is proportional to the volume of the compact dimensions .    in the following we compute the one - loop correction to the wilson line mass for an abelian gauge theory in the magnetic flux background .",
    "as we shall see , due to the effect of the flux on the kk spectrum and couplings various cancellations occur , and the total one - loop mass vanishes .",
    "the same is true for the one - loop quartic coupling .",
    "this result can be understood by considering the 6d lagrangian rather than the 4d lagrangian : the wilson lines are the goldstone bosons of symmetries of the 6d lagrangian , which are spontaneously broken by the background gauge field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . to introduce some formalism",
    "we first consider a supersymmetric abelian 6d gauge theory without flux and derive the 4d lagrangian of all kk modes in terms of chiral and vector superfields in sec .",
    "[ sec : abeliannoflux ] .",
    "the 4d lagrangian in the case of flux is derived for an abelian and a non - abelian gauge theory in sec .",

    "[ sec : radcorr ] deals with the one - loop effective potential for the wilson line of an abelian gauge theory , and the mass and the quartic coupling of the wilson line are computed in the case with flux .",
    "the role of wilson lines as goldstone bosons is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : goldstone ] , and we conclude with an outlook in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a globally supersymmetric @xmath2 gauge theory in six dimensions .",
    "two of the dimensions are compactified on a square torus @xmath1 of area @xmath3 .",
    "following @xcite , we decompose the 6d vector multiplet into an @xmath0 vector multiplet @xmath4 and a chiral multiplet @xmath5 .",
    "the scalar part of @xmath5 contains the internal components of the vector field , @xmath6 the six - dimensional gauge action can then be written in 4d superspace as @xcite @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "note that compared to @xcite we have performed an integration by parts in the last term .",
    "we further include a hypermultiplet of charge @xmath9 that decomposes into two 4d chiral multiplets of opposite charge , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding matter action can be written as @xmath12    it is straightforward to compute the 4d effective action , keeping the full kk tower in the gauge sector as well as the matter sector .",
    "the superfields , which depend on all six coordinates , can be decomposed in terms of modes of fixed internal momenta , @xmath13 here the index @xmath14 runs over all spacetime dimensions , whereas @xmath15 and @xmath16 only run over non - compact and compact dimensions , respectively .",

    "at each kk level they absorb the imaginary part of of the complex field @xmath5 whereas the real part corresponds to the mass degenerate scalar that is needed to complete the massive vector multiplet .",
    "this can be made manifest by means of a shift of the vector field ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 performing the shift of @xmath26 and neglecting a total derivative , one obtains for the 4d gauge action @xmath27 this is the standard @xmath0 supersymmetric action for a massless vector multiplet together with a tower of massive kk vector multiplets .",
    "a massless chiral multiplet @xmath28 remains since the vector multiplet can only be shifted if @xmath24 .    in order to include the matter sector we have to evaluate integrals of three and four mode functions",
    "this yields the couplings of the different kk levels and guarantees momentum conservation in the internal space .",
    "the relevant integrals are @xmath29 the complete effective 4d action , including gauge and matter kk towers , is given by @xmath30 in addition to the gauge field @xmath26 and @xmath31 , it describes massless and massive matter fields that are formed from pairs of chiral multiplets @xmath11 and @xmath10 with dirac mass terms @xmath32 . at all kk levels the vector and matter fields are mass degenerate .    in the following sections we shall restrict the discussion to massless fields in the uncharged sector , which are denoted by @xmath33 and @xmath31",
    ". the action then takes the simplified form @xmath34 note that the zero mode @xmath31 , the wilson line of the gauge field , couples to matter like the mass terms .",
    "now we turn the attention to the flux background in the internal dimensions",
    ". since they are compact the flux is quantized .",
    "moreover , the mass spectrum and field profiles of charged fields will be changed drastically and resemble that of landau levels . due to the magnetic field the charged fields will be localized in the extra dimensional space .",
    "a harmonic oscillator analogy , based on the work of @xcite and used in @xcite , allows to explicitly construct the shape of the charged field profiles @xcite . in this way",
    "we obtain the four - dimensional effective action in terms of 4d superfields , restricted to the zero modes of the uncharged fields .      before we derive the full supersymmetric effective action we want to elucidate the harmonic oscillator approach in a minimal example .",
    "for that reason we only consider the six - dimensional gauge field @xmath35 as a background for a charged scalar field @xmath36 of charge @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the 6d action reads @xmath37 with the gauge covariant derivative acting as @xmath38 .",
    "the gauge field background accounts for a constant flux density @xmath39 in the internal dimensions , which in our choice of gauge reads @xmath40 as mentioned above , for the square torus of volume @xmath3 the flux is quantized . in the presence of particles with charge @xmath9",
    "the flux density can take the values @xmath41 using a product space metric for @xmath42 , and splitting the kinetic terms into 4d and 2d parts , the six - dimensional action decomposes as @xmath43 where after integration by parts in the internal coordinates we define the 2d hamiltonian @xmath44 in analogy to the quantum harmonic oscillator with hamiltonian @xmath45 and the standard commutator relation @xmath46 = i \\hbar$ ] , we identify @xmath47 with the commutator relation @xmath48 = -i q g f \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this leads to the further identification @xmath49 @xcite , since we choose @xmath39 to be negative for left - handed zero modes , c.f .",
    "one now defines the ladder operators @xmath50 which satisfy the canonical commutator relation @xmath51 = 1 $ ] .",
    "the internal hamiltonian can be written in terms of the ladder operators as @xmath52 therefore , the energy eigenvalues of @xmath53 and thus the 4d landau level masses show the typical spectrum of an harmonic oscillator .",
    "all levels are @xmath54-fold degenerate , with @xmath55 the number of flux quanta on the torus , in analogy to landau levels .",
    "we denote the internal field profiles as @xmath56 , see @xcite , where @xmath57 refers to the landau level and @xmath58 accounts for the @xmath54-fold degeneracy .",

    "the specific form of the field profile is irrelevant and we will only need the orthonormality condition .",
