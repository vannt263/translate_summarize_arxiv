    "there are various types of predictions from the nl@xmath1 m for the behavior of s=1 chains that have been tested to varying extents numerically or experimentally .",
    "some of the predictions are not really specific to the nl@xmath1 m but would follow from any relativistic quantum field theory with a triplet of massive particles .",
    "these include the relativistic dispersion relation@xcite , exponential temperature ( @xmath3 ) dependence of the specific heat and bose condensation transition at a critical magnetic field@xcite . a qualitative prediction specific to the nl@xmath1 m",
    "is the absence of boundstates .",
    "quantitative predictions , following from the details of the magnon interactions , have also been made concerning the two@xcite and three@xcite magnon contributions to the neutron scattering cross section .",
    "however , perhaps mainly because these contributions are so small , they have , so far , not been tested numerically or experimentally .    in this paper",
    "we present numerical results on low lying states of the spin chain with both open and periodic boundary conditions using the density matrix group ( dmrg ) technique.@xcite we keep m=800 states in our dmrg calculations .",
    "the biggest truncation error is @xmath4 and the largest system size is l=200 .",
    "these results are used to study the interactions of the edge spins with each other and with bulk magnons , as well as the interactions of 2 magnons with each other . in particular , we determine numerically one parameter which characterizes the low energy magnon interactions , the scattering length for two parallel spin magnons .",
    "we deduce how this single parameter determines finite size corrections to the s=2 two magnon state with both periodic and open boundary conditions .",
    "we also show that the same parameter determines the leading correction to the square root singularity of the magnetization at the ( lower ) critical field and generalize this results to finite t and length l. numerical results on all these quantities give a consistent value for the magnon scattering length of the s=1 chain , of about -2 lattice constants or about @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the correlation length . on the other hand ,",
    "the exact s - matrix for the nl@xmath1 m gives a scattering length of @xmath7 , roughly twice as large .",
    "thus , the nl@xmath1 m does not fair well in its first quantitative comparison to the s=1 chain .",
    "this is perhaps not terribly surprising given that the mapping only becomes exact , at low energies , at large s. better agreement could be expected for larger s or for s=1 with a ( non - frustrating ) ferromagnetic next nearest neighbor coupling added to decrease the bare coupling constant in the nl@xmath1 m .",

    "thus the energy , to @xmath23 in all cases is given by : @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath36 is the appropriate boundary scattering length .",
    "dmrg results on 2 magnon energies of various s were reported by white and huse .",
    "they found repulsive interaction energy for s=0,2 but attractive for s=1 .",
    "this is completely consistent with our approach .",
    "they did not use unequal wave - vectors for the 2 magnons in their definition of the interaction energy , in the even s case .",
    "thus their positive interaction energy is presumably of @xmath192 and just reflects the effective fermi statistics of the dilute bose system , i.e. the requirement of unequal wave - vectors .",
    "the attractive interaction energy in the s=1 channel corresponds to a negative @xmath193 .",
    "they only present data for l=60 , but if we assume that the @xmath113 term is dominating at that value of l we extract a value , @xmath194 , about 30% larger in magnitude than the nl@xmath1 m prediction .",
    "we now consider wave - functions , with periodic boundary conditions , containing an arbitrary number , @xmath195 , of magnons , assuming that the density and all wave - vectors are small compared to @xmath196 .",
    "to solve eq .",
    "( [ kj ] ) for the @xmath76 s for a general low energy @xmath195-particle state we now use the fact that the density is low , @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "hence , in lowest order approximation : @xmath199 the dimensionless expansion parameter is @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the density , @xmath202 .",
    "hence we may expand the @xmath76 in powers of @xmath22 .",
    "the leading correction is @xmath203 , where @xmath204 the energy of this state is approximately : @xmath205     = { 1\\over 2m}\\sum_jk_{j0}^2       + { a\\over 2ml}\\sum_{<i , j>}(k_{i0}-k_{j0})^2 . \\label{energy}\\ ] ]    we now consider the groundstate energy in the limit @xmath206 with a non - zero but small density , @xmath201 .",
    "the values of @xmath207 occupy the `` fermi sea '' , @xmath208 where @xmath209 is determined from the density : @xmath210 the groundstate energy , to @xmath211 is then : @xmath212 here we have included the zeeman term , @xmath213 in the energy ; @xmath214 is the applied magnetic field . performing the integrals gives : @xmath215 this represents an expansion of the energy in powers of the density .",
    "the first term which depends on the interactions is the @xmath216 term .",

    ". the leading order correction due to the magnon - magnon interaction is obvious around magnetization @xmath221 .",
    "this finite density correction can be generalized to finite temperature , @xmath3 , as was observed by okunishi@xcite in the special case of the @xmath42-function interaction .",
    "the correction to the free energy of lowest order in density is given by including thermal occupation numbers in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eint ] ) .",
    "@xmath222 note that it is the _ fermi _ distribution function which appears , rather than the bose function .",
    "this simply follows from the condition that the @xmath76 should all be distinct so that there is an effective occupation number for each momentum which can be 0 or 1 only .",
    "@xmath223 is evaluated at finite @xmath3 and @xmath214 , then the magnetization is obtained by the usual thermodynamic formula , @xmath224 . in order to compare with recent monte carlo data on the magnetization for the s=1 chain , it is useful to also generalize our formulae to finite length , @xmath8 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "there is a slight subtlety in doing so because the allowed wave - vectors of the magnons alternate between @xmath225 ( `` even wave - vectors '' ) for an odd number of magnons and @xmath226 ( `` odd wave - vectors '' ) for an even number .",
    "this follows from the sign change of the wave - function each time one magnon passes another one .",
    "however , this is easily dealt with exactly by inserting appropriate factors of : @xmath227 into the partition function trace .",
    "this effectively gives the chemical potential an imaginary part , essentially converting fermion occupation numbers into boson ones .",
    "for @xmath220 , the partition function is given by : @xmath228.\\ ] ] here @xmath229 denotes the partition function for free fermions with even wave - vectors ; @xmath230 denotes the partition function for bosons with odd wave - vectors , etc .",
    "note that _ inverse _ boson partition functions occur .",
    "the thermal average of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) becomes : @xmath231   \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\sum_{k_1,k_2}^o(k_1-k_2)^2\\bigl [           z^0_{fo}n_f(k_1)n_f(k_2)\\nonumber \\\\ & &       + { 1\\over z^0_{bo}}n_b(k_1)n_b(k_2)\\bigr ]       \\biggr\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first sum is over even wave - vectors and the second over odd wave - vectors .",
    "the resulting magnetization curve is plotted in fig.[mc ] .",
    "note the smoothing of the singularity at the critical field due to a finite @xmath3 and the oscillations due to a finite @xmath8 .",
    "we use the interaction parameter , @xmath188 , obtained from the ground state numerical data so there are no free parameters in drawing fig.[mc ] . the agreement with the monte carlo data,@xcite at the same length and temperature , l=100",
