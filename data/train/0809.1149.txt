    "in ref .  @xcite a nonrelativistic schrdinger model was proposed for the scattering amplitude of non - exotic multi - channel meson - meson scattering , which allows an exact solution in the form of an analytic expression for the scattering amplitude . bound states and resonances",
    "are obtained through the coupling of the two - meson system to a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) , the oscillator frequency being independent of flavor . by fine - tuning the intensity of the coupling",
    ", one can transform the oscillator spectrum into the spectrum of mesons for all possible flavor combinations .",
    "the model s results , in particular concerning the resonance and bound - state pole structure in the scalar - meson sector @xcite , are well known . here",
    ", it is our aim to show that this model corresponds to @xmath0-channel exchange of families of propagator modes , similarly to the exchange of a family of leading and daughter regge trajectories .    in the naivest quark - model picture ,",
    "quarks and antiquarks are assumed to be confined to a small region in space by strong forces .",
    "the bulk of the interactions of the quarks with the glue is contained in effective , or constituent , quark masses , whereas the remaining dynamics is described by a confining potential of sorts @xcite .",
    "the quantum numbers of the effective @xmath1 system are given by the total @xmath1 spin @xmath2 , the relative @xmath1 orbital angular momentum @xmath3 , and the @xmath1 radial excitation @xmath4 .",
    "for the lowest radial states of different flavor combinations , i.e. , having @xmath5 , the confinement - model parameters can be adjusted to experiment so as to obtain reasonable results @xcite . however , for higher radial excitations , the results are poor @xcite . of course , the reason is the absence of meson loops , in combination with a wrong fine - tuning of the model parameters of the @xmath5 states to the lowest states in the experimental spectrum @xcite .",
    "more elaborate quark models do include meson loops @xcite , and predict physical resonances instead of fictitious real meson masses only .",
    "on the other hand , in an effective , non - microscopic picture , oller and oset @xcite dynamically generated the low - lying scalar mesons @xmath6(600 ) ( alias @xmath7 meson ) , @xmath6(980 ) , and @xmath8(980 ) ( the @xmath9(800 ) or @xmath10 meson was not studied ) , by means of coupled - channel lippmann - schwinger equations with meson - meson potentials resulting from the lowest - order chiral lagrangian .",
    "their procedure boils down to using an effective four - meson vertex , summing up the bubbles from the meson loops , and unitarizing the resulting scattering amplitude .",
    "hence , they nicely showed that it only takes a four - point interaction to generate scattering poles associated with light scalar mesons .",
    "earlier , trnqvist had made a similar suggestion @xcite , but went one step further by also assuming _ pre - existing _ mesons , which correspond to an _ input spectrum for bare mesons_. unfortunately , his proposal ignored the issue of adler zeros , and so did not allow to conclude that in his model actually two scalar - meson nonets can be generated . later , in ref .",
    "@xcite he did include adler zeros , but in the subsequent analysis , together with roos @xcite , the @xmath11 ( alias @xmath10 meson ) was still not found , probably due to the use of an unphysical , negative adler zero in the @xmath12 case @xcite .",
    "the latter pole of the isodoublet @xmath2-wave scattering amplitude was then indeed generated by oller and oset , together with pelez @xcite , in an alternative coupled - channel unitarization scheme .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite oller and oset reported the observation of a second nonet , associated with _",
    "pre - existing _ meson states , in an @xmath13 approach to unitarization .",
    "this issue was thoroughly studied by boglione & pennington in ref .",
    "@xcite , who came to the conclusion that it is indeed possible to generate two states starting from one bare _ seed _ ( or _ pre - existing _ state ) only , and that it even may be plausible to dynamically generate many states with the same quantum numbers but different masses .",
    "that is exactly what had been proposed almost two decades earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an infinity of _ seeds _ was introduced , all related through one parameter , viz.the oscillator frequency @xmath14 , being the same for all flavors .",
    "when , at low energies , the sum is reduced to an effective constant , one obtains a four - meson vertex which dynamically generates exactly one pole in the case of the scalar mesons .",
    "also , at slightly higher energies , the sum can be approximated by its leading term and an effective constant for the remaining sum @xcite .",
    "then one obtains , apart from the dynamically generated resonance , a second pole associated with the one leading _",
    "seed_. however , in general , there is no need to approximate the sum , thus allowing to generate several dynamical resonance poles , @xcite and moreover an infinite number of normal resonances associated with the infinity of _",
    "seeds_. furthermore , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite can be applied to different flavos , including charm and bottom , with just one set of parameters .",
    "the low - lying scalar - meson nonet pops up without even being anticipated @xcite , using the parameters that were fine - tuned for the vector and pseudoscalar spectra in ref .",
    "however , there is an important difference with the technique of introducing by hand one or more _ seeds _",
    ", namely that the coupling constants can be controlled .",
    "the problem of couplings and propagator modes is not new . in ref .",
    "@xcite , delbourgo , rashid , salam , and strathdee remarked that it is well - known _",
    "`` that regge trajectories arise from sums of infinite sequences of feynman diagrams in conventional field theory '' _ , and , moreover , that this _  poses the problem of suitable coupling constants _  .",
    "the latter problem was solved in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a strategy was developed for the decomposition of a regge trajectory in its propagator modes . here",
    ", we shall follow a different but comparable approach .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the couplings of the propagator modes were controlled by clebsch - gordans and 9-j symbols , assuming the @xmath15 mechanism @xcite for quark - pair creation . but this procedure led to inconsistencies in the light - meson sector . however , not only the couplings , but also the choice of the spectrum of propagator modes is of importance . in refs .",
    "@xcite , such a choice was made involving one free parameter , viz .",
    "the universal level splitting , which appeared to be largely flavor independent , as we shall further elaborate in sect .",
    "[ propjesmodes ] below . based on the choice of the spectrum ,",
    "the couplings issue was solved by the @xmath15 recoupling strategy of refs .",
    "@xcite , leaving only one parameter free , which represents the probability of quark - pair creation . as a consequence ,",
    "there are only two free parameters , no matter if the whole sum of propagator modes is approximated by just one point vertex , or by the sum of a few propagator modes and one point vertex .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the meson - meson scattering model was solved with the wave - function approach ( wfa ) in refs .",
    "later , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same dynamical equations were solved by an iterative method , which we refer to by _ resonance - spectrum expansion _",
    "the latter method allows more easily a comparison with current theories for meson - meson interactions .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that both approaches , wfa and rse , lead from the same dynamical equations to the same expression for the meson - meson scattering amplitude .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , besides the usual four - meson interaction , a fictitious bare scalar @xmath10 meson was introduced , in a similar fashion as suggested by trnqvist @xcite and oller & oset @xcite , leading to a two - pole description of the @xmath16 @xmath2-wave interaction for energies up to about 1.6 gev .",
    "the behavior of these poles , as a function of one overal coupling parameter , is comparable to the pole movements of the two lowest lying @xmath10 ( or @xmath9 ) poles described in refs .",
    "namely , the lower pole , which is dynamically generated by the @xmath16-@xmath16 vertex and associated with the @xmath11 , moves towards larger negative imaginary energies , away from the real axis , according as the coupling is decreased , whereas the higher pole , stemming from the _ seed _ , approaches the real axis for decreasing coupling , ending up at the mass of the fictitious meson for vanishing coupling .",
    "this similarity in pole behavior inspires us to revisit the meson - meson scattering model of ref .",
    "@xcite , and relate it to the exchange of regge propagators @xcite .",
    "we define the amputated amplitude for non - exotic two - meson scattering by @xmath17^{-1 } \\;\\;\\ ; , \\label{texpansion}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 stands for the rse propagator and @xmath19 for the two - meson loop function . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the one - channel rse expression for the @xmath20-th partial - wave two - meson scattering amplitude follows from @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the center - of - mass ( cm ) linear momentum , @xmath23 the total invariant two - meson mass , @xmath24 and @xmath25 the spherical bessel function and hankel function of the first kind , respectively , @xmath26 the reduced two - meson mass , and @xmath27 a parameter with dimension mass@xmath28 , which can be interpreted as the average string - breaking distance .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 are discussed in sect .  [ mmmvertices ] , where in eq .",
    "( [ omatrix ] ) the relation between @xmath20 and @xmath31 is expressed .",
    "the kernel @xmath18 , which is graphically represented by fig .",
    "[ kernel ] , is the result of @xmath0-channel exchange of a system with internal structure , characterized by resonance modes and their masses @xmath32 . in the back of our mind",
    "we have , of course , the picture of a resonating quark - antiquark system .",
    "but this is not of much importance yet .",
    "so we consider the exchange of propagators with structure , rather than of single and pointlike massive objects , in the very same spirit as a regge propagator .    at the vertices , each mode couples",
    "independently to the meson pairs .    [ cols=\"^ \" ,",
    "]     for @xmath33 , the recoupling constants squared in one column add up to 1 , with the proviso that meson pairs with two different mesons count twice , as actually we should have repeated the corresponding lines in the table for the interchanged pair .",
    "this result reflects the fact that we consider a properly normalized distribution for each mode , and an orthonormal set of two - meson distributions .    for @xmath34",
    ", the recoupling constants squared in one column do not add up to 1 .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath34 more possible two - meson systems couple to the propagator modes .",
    "if those were included in the tables , we would obtain unity for all @xmath35 .",
    "a full table would have infinite length .",
    "moreover , even when limited to @xmath36 and only for a few radial excitations , one would easily end up with a table of hundreds of pages .",
    "however , with a fast computer code in fortran , based on the expressions given in refs .",
    "@xcite , and which moreover takes care of the various possible isospin combinations and also allows for unequal effective flavor masses , the absence of such tables is no limitation .",
    "in their comment @xcite on the work of trnqvist & roos @xcite , isgur & speth pointed out that , since exotic channels do not couple to the propagator of eq .",
    "( [ vandomega ] ) , the corresponding scattering amplitude vanishes , which is not in agreement with experiment .",
    "furthermore , they argued that in the jlich model @xcite @xmath37-channel processes lie at the origin of a _ broad _ dynamically generated pole in the @xmath38 @xmath2-wave pion - pion scattering amplitude , and not @xmath0-channel propagator modes .",
    "finally , they remarked that also the @xmath39 and @xmath40 are largely due to @xmath37-channel forces .",
    "now , it seems indisputable that with zero couplings their is no scattering .",
    "nevertheless , the first observation of isgur & speth is incomplete .",
    "namely , when just arbitrary couplings and _ seeds _ are involved , then there is no clear prescription how to handle exotic channels .",
    "however , when propagator modes and couplings are related , like in the choice of ref .  @xcite and the corresponding recoupling constants of ref .",
    "@xcite , then quark - interchange processes , and so scattering in exotic channels , make part of the interactions that can be handled in the model .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quark - interchange diagrams were suppressed in order to single out the effect of the propagator modes in @xmath0-channel exchange via @xmath15 pair creation .",
    "consequently , although in principle there is no limitation in the model inhibiting the study of exotic channels , it is just neglected in the rse approach to non - exotic meson - meson scattering . a study also including the quark - interchange diagrams has been carried out by bicudo and ribeiro in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite fariborz , jora & schechter observed that neglecting the @xmath37-channel exchange of a @xmath41 meson in @xmath38 @xmath2-wave @xmath42 scattering does not remove the @xmath7 pole from the scattering amplitude of their model , and only shifts it in a modest way .",
    "also note that the dynamical `` @xmath43 '' pole generated by the jlich group @xcite is considerably lighter and broader than generally accepted .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , also boglione & pennington remarked : _",
    "`` @xmath0-channel dynamics is not all that controls the scattering '' _ , when refering to ref .",
    "however , one may not conclude from spicing up with @xmath37-channel exchange , a model which only accounts for one ( or a few ) propagator modes , moreover in the ladder approximation , that meson - exchange contributions are really needed . in their replies to the comments on their work , trnqvist and roos stressed the concept of",
    "_ duality_. hence , it is not even clear whether @xmath37-channel exchange should be considered at all , when all propagator modes in @xmath0-channel exchange are accounted for .",
    "duality @xcite probably just works the other way around as well .",
    "so either take all @xmath37-exchange contributions into account , ideally in an untruncated fashion and not just in the ladder approximation , or all @xmath0-exchange contributions , but not both .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath44(980 ) and @xmath45(980 ) poles , for variations in the rse couplings , was studied in refs .",
    "no further @xmath37-channel exchange was needed in order to describe these scalar resonances by the lowest dynamically generated poles of the model in @xmath46 , for respectively @xmath38 and @xmath47 .",
    "the modelling is just a bit more complicated than for the @xmath7 and the @xmath10 , because lower lying , but not very strongly coupled , channels are involved as well , namely @xmath42 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "in fact , the correct way to describe the @xmath44 resonances is , of course , by employing a coupled - channel approach to the @xmath38 @xmath2-wave @xcite .",
    "then one obtains in the rse both the @xmath44(600 ) ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath44(980 ) resonances , in agreement with data , besides other scattering observables like phase shifts , line - shapes , and inelasticities @xcite .",
    "recently , _ the true pole positions of broad states _ were highlighted @xcite .",
    "however , pole positions will always depend on the properties of a specific model . for narrow resonances",
    "there will be agreement , to some extent , among different models .",
    "but for broad structures it is rather unlikely that different appoaches will lead to exactly the same pole positions .",
    "boglione & pennington wrote : _ `` fitting data along the real axis can not accurately determine the true pole position of a broad state without an analytic continuation , or a very specific model '' _ @xcite . hence ,",
    "unless we fully agree on the _ perfect model _ to describe the available data , true pole positions for broad structures do not exist .",
    "at best , we may agree on whether a specific pole exists .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the description of elastic @xmath49-wave @xmath50 scattering and the @xmath51 resonance , the propagator of eq .",
    "( [ complitude ] ) was approximated by the first term plus a constant representing the remainder of the sum : @xmath52 such a procedure is equivalent to the approaches of trnqvist @xcite and oset & oller @xcite , as discussed in the introduction . in the latter approaches , however , one looses track of the relations among all coupling constants , thus needing to introduce arbitrary parameters , like @xmath53 and @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ bwkpipwave ] ) , while also contact with different flavors and other angular momenta is lost . nevertheless , in the approximation of eq .",
    "( [ bwkpipwave ] ) , one can study sufficiently well the properties of the dynamically generated and the lowest @xmath1 resonances .    in the case of elastic @xmath49-wave @xmath50 scattering",
    ", no dynamically generated resonance is found .",
    "so , when the overall coupling is decreased , the @xmath51 pole returns to @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "but for non - exotic elastic @xmath2-wave @xmath50 scattering , the dynamically generated @xmath11 resonance appears , besides the @xmath56 .",
    "we may thus conclude that the contact term indeed absorps those terms of the regge propagator which are not accounted for . in the loop sum  ( [ texpansion ] )",
    "its contribution is negligible , provided a complete regge propagator is exchanged .",
    "hence , this result seems to suggest that the contact term is not necessary at all in a microscopic formulation .",
    "the effect of hadron loops on the spectra of mesons and baryons has been studied by various groups , and for a variety of different confinement mechanisms @xcite . for mesons ,",
    "the procedure usually amounts to the inclusion of meson loops in a @xmath1 description , or , equivalently , the inclusion of quark loops in a model for meson - meson scattering .",
    "this results in resonance widths , central masses that do not coincide with the pure confinement spectrum , mass shifts of bound states , resonance line - shapes that are very different from the usual breit - wigner ones , threshold effects and cusps .",
    "in particular , it should be mentioned that mass shifts are large and negative for the ground states of the various flavor configurations @xcite .",
    "unquenching the lattice is still in its infancy , at least for the light scalars , as we conclude from ref .",
    "however , its effects should not be underestimated .",
    "hence , ground - state levels of quenched approximations for @xmath1 configurations in relative @xmath2-waves must be expected to come out far above the experimental masses .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the model is not limited to the study of non - exotic channels .",
    "however , @xmath15 pair creation / annihilation , through which process meson pairs couple to the regge propagator , does not work for exotic channels .",
    "nevertheless , the alternative , which is _ quark interchange _ , does give contributions to all possible hadronic final - state interactions , hence also for exotic two - meson channels .",
    "quark - interchange contributions to meson - meson interactions can be determined @xcite with the very same techniques that were developed in refs .",
    "as may be concluded from eq .",
    "( [ texpansion ] ) , and from the expressions for @xmath57 and @xmath58 given in eq .",
    "( [ vandomega ] ) , the dressed partial - wave rse propagator for strong interactions takes the form ( restricted to the one - channel case and leaving out some parts not essential for our discussion in this section ) @xmath59    this propagator has the very intriguing property that it vanishes for @xmath60 .",
    "hence , one may wonder what happens in a physical process when the propagator does not allow any signal to pass .",
    "we shall show in the following that this phenomenon can be , and has indeed been , observed in experiment , but not in scattering processes .",
    "the rse amplitude for strong scattering is given in eqs .",
    "( [ texpansion],[unit ] ) .",
    "one easily verifies that it does not vanish in the limit @xmath60 . however , for strong production processes , we deduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , following a similar procedure as roca , palomar , oset , and chiang in ref .",
    "@xcite , a relation between the production amplitude and the scattering amplitude , reading @xmath61 which , using eqs .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) and ( [ texpansion ] ) , can also be written as @xmath62 for the latter expression we find , by the use of eq .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) , that the production amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ production ] ) tends to zero when @xmath60 .",
    "this effect must be visible in experimental strong production cross sections .",
    "actually , the primary question here is not so much if a vanishing @xmath1 propagator is observable , but rather whether the production amplitude always vanishes when @xmath60 . in order to answer this",
    ", we must return to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where we found , for the complete production amplitude in the case of multi - channel processes , that eq .",
    "( [ production ] ) represents the leading term , and that the remainder is expressed in terms of the inelastic components of the scattering amplitude .",
    "the latter terms do not vanish in the limit @xmath60 , as we have discussed above .",
    "hence , the production amplitude only vanishes _ approximately _ in this limit , in case inelasticity is suppressed",
    ".    however , there are more questions to be responded with respect to the observability of vanishing propagators .",
    "namely , do processes exist where only one partial wave contributes and in which processes other than @xmath0-channel exchange do not play an important role ?",
    "fortunately , the answer to the latter , pertinent , question can be responded afirmatively , because electron - positron annihilation into multi - hadron final states takes basically place via one photon , hence with @xmath63 quantum numbers .",
    "consequently , when the photon materializes into a pair of current quarks , which couple via the @xmath1 propagator to the final multi - hadron state , we may assume that the intermediate propagator carries the quantum numbers of the photon .",
    "moreover , alternative processes are suppressed .",
    "we may thus conclude that , if we want to discover whether the propagator really vanishes at @xmath60 , then the ideal touchstone is @xmath64 annihilation into multi - hadron states .",
    "but not only do we have at our disposal a wealth of experimental results on such processes , there also exist predictions for the values of @xmath32 , with @xmath65 or @xmath66 , given by the parameter set of ref .  @xcite . as an example , for @xmath67 one finds in the latter paper @xmath68 gev and @xmath69 gev . using eq .",
    "( [ hospectrum ] ) , we then get for the higher @xmath67 confinement states the spectrum @xmath70 gev , @xmath71 gev , @xmath72 gev ,  .",
    "the latter two levels of the @xmath67 confinement spectrum can indeed be clearly observed in experiment .",
    "for example , the non - resonant signal in @xmath73 ( see fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is divided into two substructures @xcite , since the full @xmath67 propagator ( [ propagator ] ) , dressed with meson loops , vanishes at @xmath74 gev @xcite . in the same set of data",
    ", one may observe a lower - lying zero at @xmath75 gev @xcite , more distinctly visible in the data on @xmath76 ( see fig .  3 of ref .",
    "the true @xmath67 resonances can be found on the slopes of the above - mentioned non - resonant structures @xcite , unfortunately with little statistical significance , if any @xcite .    in the light - quark sector , where low statistics does not result in sufficient accuracy",
    ", one needs some imagination for the identification of vanishing amplitudes in @xmath64 annihilation processes into multi - hadron states .",
    "thus , from data given in ref .",
    "@xcite , one may infer that certain four - pion amplitudes vanish at , or near , the predicted @xcite 1.097 gev @xmath77 ground state , and near the predicted 1.477 gev @xmath77 excited state .",
    "some further evidence , also for the predicted higher excited states in @xmath77 and @xmath78 , is found in data from refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "so we indeed observe minima in production processes , which confirm vanishing @xmath1 propagators .",
    "moreover , the @xmath1 confinement spectrum predicted 25 years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite seems to agree well with experimental observations for vector mesons .",
    "accordingly , we expect vector - meson @xmath1 resonances associated with each of the regge states : one ground state , dominantly in a @xmath1 @xmath2-wave , and two resonances for each of the higher excited regge states , viz.one dominantly in an @xmath2-wave , and the other mostly in a @xmath79-wave ( see fig .  [ vectors ] ) .",
    "we have found that the meson spectrum can be described by @xmath0-channel exchange of regge propagators in non - exotic meson - meson interactions , and furthermore that the bound - state and resonance spectrum of mesons is richer than , and different from , the underlying regge spectrum @xcite .",
    "for the latter we generally observe very regular and equidistant level spacings , instead of quadratic trajectories .",
    "we also have established a link between @xmath0-channel exchange of regge propagators and unitarized chiral models constructed for the study of resonances in @xmath2-wave meson - meson scattering . moreover , a method is given to relate the coupling constants and seed masses for the latter models .",
    "moreover , we have indicated how the regge spectrum of @xmath1 propagator modes may be observed in production processes .",
    "finally , the use of regge propagators for meson physics is seen @xcite not to be restricted to light flavors , but can , without any further effort , be extended to heavy quarkonia with the same set of parameters , i.e. , the effective quark masses , the universal frequency @xmath14 , the overall vertex intensity @xmath29 , and the average string - breaking distance @xmath27 .",
