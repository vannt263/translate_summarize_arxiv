    "one of the main objectives of detecting new extrasolar planets is to constrain theories of planet formation , migration and evolution .",
    "exoplanet discoveries are therefore used to build up our general knowledge about planetary systems .",
    "it is therefore crucial that these exoplanets are indeed _ bona - fide _ planets .",
    "however , periodic signals with a relatively low amplitude compatible with a planetary nature are not necessarily planets @xcite . indeed",
    ", many astrophysical non - planetary scenarios ( the so - called `` false - positives '' ) can mimic the signal of a planet .",
    "all techniques are affected : the radial - velocity planetary signals might be mimicked by stellar activity or nearly face - on binaries ; the photometric transit signals of a planet can be mimicked by various configurations of eclipsing binaries ; false - positive scenarios might also produce misinterpreted direct imaging and microlensing exoplanet detections . in some cases , the source of the signal is a planet , but the amplitude of the signal is diluted by the presence of a brighter star in the system .",
    "therefore , the derived properties of the planets ( without accounting for the contaminating light ) might be significantly different , hence limiting the accuracy of statistical analysis based on planet detections ( e.g * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "+ it is therefore fundamental to secure the planetary nature of a detection .",
    "this is especially important for transiting exoplanets , for which a substantial fraction of transit - like events are not of planetary origin .",
    "one way to establish the planetary nature of a transiting candidate is through high - resolution spectroscopy and radial velocity measurements @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations can efficiently screen out eclipsing binaries as well as triple systems .",
    "then , to establish the planetary nature of a candidate , it is commonly considered that a transit candidate has to satisfy all the following requirements : ( 1 ) a radial velocity variation is significantly detected in phase with the transit ephemeris ; ( 2 ) the inferred mass is compatible with that of a planet ; ( 3 ) no significant correlation is found between this rv variation and the asymmetry of the line profile ( the bisector ) ; ( 4 ) the signal is stable in time and amplitude . +",
    "this technique works relatively well for systems where the reflex motion of the host can be observed with current instrumentation .",
    "however , for the thousands of potential small planets that the _ kepler _ space telescope detected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the reflex motion is too small to be observed @xcite , therefore limiting the establishment of their planetary nature .",
    "other non - spectroscopic methods exist to measure the mass of a transiting planet , such as the relativistic doppler - boosting effect and through dynamical interaction with other planets in the system @xcite .",
    "however , these techniques are limited to very short orbital period planets or multiple - planet systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "+ an alternative solution has been proposed by @xcite , called the planet - validation .",
    "this technique consists in evaluating the probability of each scenario to produce the observed data .",
    "if the planet scenario turns out to be significantly the most likely scenario , then the planet is considered as validated statistically .",
    "however , as demonstrated by @xcite , if the transit signal has a signal - to - noise ratio below 150 , it is not possible to validate the nature of a transiting exoplanet based only on the photometric data . in such configuration",
    ", the validation relies on the accuracy of the _ a priori _ information .",
    "this is clearly a limitation for the exploration of planets like the earth since the statistics in this population is extremely low . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "the solution is to increase the statistical weight of the data compared with the priors in the validation procedure , by modelling data from different techniques providing different constraints to the various scenarios .",
    "+ the objective of this paper is to show how spectroscopic diagnoses can be used to constraints false - positive scenarios in the context of the validation of planets performed with the ` pastis ` software @xcite . for that , we explore the effects of a blended star on the measurement of both the radial velocity , the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) and the line - asymmetry diagnoses already defined in the literature ( e.g. the bisector inverse slope ) .",
    "these diagnoses are commonly used to disentangle planetary signals from stellar activity in radial velocity data ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "these diagnoses have already been used by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , , @xcite , and recently by to analyse blended radial velocity of double - line binary systems mimicking planets or brown dwarfs . + note that the impact of stellar contamination on precise radial velocity has already been studied by in the context of the preparation of the espresso spectrograph .",
    "previously , the effect of a contaminating star has also been studied by @xcite to constrain the false - positive scenario of ogle - tr-56 which mimic both a transit and radial velocity signals of a planet . in this paper",
    ", we extend the work done by these authors , including all the spectroscopic diagnoses .",
    "we also investigate how these diagnoses change as function of the parameters of the target and contaminating star .",
    "finally , we propose a formalism to estimate the amplitude of a radial velocity signal as function of the parameters of the blended components .",
    "+ we first explore in section [ contimpact ] the impact of a blended contaminant on precise radial velocity and the line - profile diagnoses . then , we present in section  [ sensitivity ] the sensitivity of radial velocity data to constrain blend scenarios . in section  [ realcase ] ,",
    "we test our ` pastis ` rv - blend model by re - analysing an unresolved nearly face - on binary , hd16702 .",
    "we report some caveats in section  [ caveats ] .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section  [ discut ] and discuss how these radial velocity constraints complement the photometric ones in the context of planet validation . + several appendices are available at the end of this paper . in appendix",

    "at the resolution of most spectrographs used to measure precise radial velocities of stars ( 40 000  120 000 ) , an unblended and unsaturated weak line profile of a slow - rotating star could be approximated by a gaussian function .",
    "averaging thousand of such lines using the cross - correlation technique also produces a gaussian profile .",
    "the ccf presents the advantage of having a much higher signal - to - noise ratio compared with individual lines without modifying the shape of the averaged line profile .",
    "this function is characterised by a given location in the radial velocity space , a contrast and a fwhm .",
    "an asymmetry in the observed line profile can be produced by , e.g. the convective blue shift , pulsations , stellar spots @xcite , and contaminating stars . to monitor the line asymmetry ,",
    "several diagnoses have been defined in the literature .",
    "they are detailed in the appendix [ rvdiag ] of this paper and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ diagnfig ] . for clarity",
    ", we list them here :    * bis : it consists in computing the velocity span between the average of the top portion of the bisector and the bottom portion of the bisector , within some defined limits . *",
    ": it consists in fitting a gaussian profile to the top and bottom part of the line profile .",
    "the asymmetry diagnosis is defined as the difference between the two velocities . *",
    "bigauss : it consists in fitting an asymmetric gaussian profile to the line profile ( see eq .",
    "[ asymgauss ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry diagnosis is defined as the difference between the radial velocity found with the symmetric and asymmetric gaussian profiles . *",
    ": it consists in computing the difference of spectral information contained in the blue and red wings of the line profile . *",
    "( this work , see appendix [ rvdiag ] ) : it consists in fitting a gaussian profile to the red and blue wings of the line profile .",
    "the asymmetry diagnosis is defined as the difference between the two velocities .",
    "these diagnoses can be measured directly on each individual stellar lines available in the spectrum , as long as their profiles have been correctly reproduced by the spectrograph and are not perturbed by an external source like other unresolved lines , or the spectrum of a calibration lamp , an iodine cell , the earth atmosphere , or the sun light reflected by the moon . to improve their precision ,",
    "those diagnoses can be measured on the averaged line profile which is obtained by computing the weighted cross - correlation function .",
    "note that this technique conserves the line - profile shape only if the observed spectrum is correlated with a binary , box - shaped mask @xcite .",
    "the correlation with a non - box - shaped mask such as a master - spectrum template @xcite or a synthetic model might smooth out the diagnoses variation , if any , and thus decrease the efficiency of the method presented here .      to test the effect of a contaminating star , we simulated , as described in appendix [ ccfmodel ] , the line profile of a target star with a radial velocity of 0 , a fwhm of 10 , and a contrast of 30% .",
    "those values are typical for a main - sequence star with solar metallicity and a slow rotation observed at high - resolution ( r @xmath0 40000 ) .",
    "we then blended this main line profile with a contaminating one with a fwhm of 70% , 100% , and 130% of the target fwhm , a radial velocity shift , @xmath1 , from the target star ranging from @xmath2  to @xmath3  and a contrast of 30% .",
    "we fixed a flux ratio between the target and the blend lines of 1 to 100 .",
    "those values have been chosen to illustrate the effect of a blend on precise spectroscopic diagnosis .",
    "changing their value will not change the general behavior presented here , it will just rescale all the values . for each pair of radial velocity shift and fwhm of the blended star",
    ", we measured the radial velocity , contrast , fwhm as well as the five line - asymmetry diagnoses presented in section [ sectdiagnpres ] and in appendix [ rvdiag ] .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ alldiagn ] .",
    "the dash , solid and dot - dash lines represent the measured diagnoses as function of the radial velocity shift between the two stars for a fwhm of the blend of 7 , 10 , and 13 , respectively .",
    "+    we also check the correlation between the measured diagnoses and the measured radial velocity .",
    "the correlation plots are displayed in fig .",
    "[ alldiagn ] .",
    "we discuss the results of these simulations in the sections [ effectrv ]  [ effectbis ] .",
    "the effect of a contaminating star on the measurement of the radial velocity is displayed in fig .",
    "[ alldiagn ] .",
    "such perturbation is qualitatively similar to the rossiter - mclaughlin anomaly , where a faint fraction of the line profile is `` subtracted '' by the eclipsing object .",
    "this rossiter - mclaughlin anomaly has been described analytically , e.g. in , assuming gaussian profiles and a small eclipsing object ( i.e. a planet ) compared with the stellar radius . on the opposite , here",
    ", the faint line of a contaminant is added to the target one .",
    "if we assume that both the target and the contaminant have gaussian profiles and a flux - ratio small enough ( i.e. the contaminant is much fainter than the target ) , we can approximate the rv - blend anomaly behavior as the opposite of the rossiter - mclaughlin anomaly .",
    "thus , following , we can describe the radial velocity - blend anomaly ( @xmath4 ) by the equation : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the gaussian widths of the two line profiles , which depends on the and the instrumental resolution , @xmath1 is the radial velocity shift between them and @xmath8 is the flux ratio .",
    "+ using equation [ rvperturb ] , we can determine the radial velocity shift that maximize the perturbation ( @xmath9 ) by computing the zero of its first derivative : @xmath10    therefore , a contaminating star affects the measurement of the radial velocity in two different ways , depending if @xmath11 is lower or greater than @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 , the observed radial velocity will be _ correlated _ with the radial velocity variation of the blending star .",
    "on the opposite , if @xmath14 , the observed radial velocity will be _ anti - correlated _ with the radial velocity variation of the contaminating star . note that by definition of the rayleigh criterion , if @xmath14 , the two line profiles are spectroscopically _ resolved _ and if @xmath13 , they are spectroscopically _",
    "unresolved_. + now , if we compute the maximum amplitude of @xmath4 when @xmath15 in equation [ rvperturb ] , we find that : @xmath16 this equation shows that the larger @xmath6 is , due to stellar rotation or to lack of instrumental resolution , the larger is the rv - blend anomaly signal .",
    "+ the rv - blend anomaly displayed in fig .",
    "[ alldiagn ] is similar to the one found by , except that we do not found the secondary anomaly reported by these authors at large rv - separation , which is caused when the contaminant leaves the cross - correlation domain . for larger separation ,",
    "the lines are resolved and this technique does not provide constraints to planet validation .",
    "the fwhm is affected by the presence of a contaminant . in the cases that we simulated here ,",
    "the variation in fwhm is about two times larger than the one in radial velocity ( see fig [ alldiagn ] ) . as for the radial velocity ,",
    "the fwhm varies in case of blended star in two different regimes : the fwhm is correlated with @xmath1 for small rv separation and anti - correlated for large rv separation .",
    "the maximum of the fwhm - blend anomaly occurs at a different value of @xmath1 .",
    "if the two stars have similar radial velocities ( @xmath17 ) , a small radial velocity variation of the contaminant will not produce a large variation of the fwhm value .",
    "the variation is even fainter if the contaminant star is rotating fast .",
    "the contrast of the line profile is also affected by the contaminating stars .",
    "compared with the other diagnoses , the contrast presents only small variations .",
    "moreover , the contrast can be perturbed by several instrumental systematics such as residuals of the ccd dark current correction , non - linearity of the ccd , sky luminosity variation caused by the moon , twilight , or city lights or even sky transparency related to the humidity and the presence of clouds .",
    "therefore , the contrast of the line profile is not a good diagnosis to constrain blended components .",
    "the contrast might still be used to highlight unseen stars in a spectrum ( e.g. o - type stars ) which would not present many stellar lines apart from the balmer lines , but would dilute substantially the spectrum of the contaminant . in this case , a narrow line profile with a low contrast could be observed , and the low - contrast anomaly might be used to reveal the presence of a massive or very fast - rotating star . however , in extremis , this could also be mimicked by a metal - poor star . for these reasons",
    ", we will not mentioned it anymore in the rest of the paper .",
    "it is well known that a contaminating star affects the asymmetry of the line of the target star if their radial velocity separation is small enough .",
    "all the asymmetry diagnoses present a similar anomaly curve , with different amplitude , except for which present an anomaly curve with an opposite sign ( note the reversed y axis in fig .",
    "[ alldiagn ] for the diagnosis ) .",
    "this opposite shape of the anomaly curve is due to its different definition compared with other diagnoses ( see appendix [ rvdiag ] for more details about their definition ) .",
    "compared to the other diagnoses , we observe three different regimes of the asymmetry - anomaly curves presented in fig .",
    "[ alldiagn ] , depending on the fwhm of the contaminating star ( fwhm@xmath18 ) , compared with the target star ( fwhm@xmath19 ) :    1 .",

    "[ alldiagn ] ) , the anomaly curves of the bis , , bigauss and present a shape that is similar with the radial velocity - anomaly curve .",
    "the main difference is that the maximum anomaly is reached for a radial velocity separation of about twice @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ alldiagn ] ) .",
    "such separation difference in the maximum of the anomalies is the cause of the `` figure eight loop '' seen in the correlation between the line asymmetry and the radial velocity ( see fig .",

    "[ alldiagn ] ) , the asymmetry diagnoses are not very sensitives to a contaminant with a small radial velocity separation",
    ". this configuration could be quite common when the fwhm of both stars are dominated by the instrumental resolution and not by stellar rotation .",
    "a contaminating star with the same fwhm than the target star and with a radial velocity variation up to a few  around the target systemic radial velocity will only slightly affect the bis , , , bigauss , and . in this blind zone",

    "[ alldiagn ] ) , all asymmetry diagnoses present three regimes : for small values of @xmath1 , the measured asymmetry is anti - correlated with @xmath1 and thus , with the observed radial velocity .",
    "then , for intermediate values of @xmath1 , the asymmetry diagnoses are correlated with the observed radial velocity .",
    "finally , as in case ( i ) , when the two stars have a large rv separation , the asymmetry diagnosis is anti - correlated with @xmath1 but correlated with the observed radial velocity .",
    "the various asymmetry diagnoses presented in the previous section are not of equal sensitivity to blend scenarios .",
    "the diagnosis that presents a maximum of sensitivity to a contaminant is , then bigauss , bis , and finally .",
    "this has to be compared with the sensitivity to noise in the line profile . for that , we estimated the photon noise uncertainty in the various diagnoses .",
    "we took a solar spectrum observed on the blue sky with a signal to noise ( snr ) greater than 150 by the harps @xcite and sophie spectrographs . for sophie ,",
    "we used two different spectra , one for each instrumental configuration : the high - resolution ( hr , r @xmath23 75000 ) and high - efficiency ( he , r @xmath23 39000 ) modes . for comparison , harps has a resolution of r @xmath23 110000 .",
    "we add white noise to these spectra at the level of 10% , 5% , 2% , and 1% of the flux in each pixel , that we generated 100 times .",
    "we ended with 400 spectra for each instrument .",
    "we cross correlated all these spectra using a g2v numerical mask and measured all the diagnoses .",
    "we then computed the standard deviation of all the diagnoses for each noise level .",
    "they all exhibit a clear correlation with the radial velocity photon noise .",
    "we fitted this correlation with a 1-d polynomial and report in the table [ errordiags ] the value of the slope , for each diagnosis and each instruments .",
    "therefore , these values should be used to scale the diagnoses uncertainty , given the radial velocity photon noise such as : @xmath24 with @xmath25 the photon noise uncertainty of the diagnosis @xmath26 , @xmath27 the scaling coefficient listed in table [ errordiags ] , and @xmath28 the radial velocity uncertainty .",
    "note however that those values represent only the photon noise uncertainty .",
    "those diagnoses are also sensitives to instrumental effects which might produce important additional red noise .",
    "note that the typical photon noise reached by sophie and harps on stars in the magnitude range 12  16 is presented in @xcite and compared with the expected radial velocity amplitude of the _ kepler _ candidates in @xcite .",
