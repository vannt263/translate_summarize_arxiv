    "this paper summarizes kormendy & freeman ( 2014 ) . that paper derives structural parameter correlations for dm halos in sc ",
    "im and dsph galaxies . we restrict ourselves to objects that contain only two main components , a baryonic disk or main body and a dm halo . for galaxies with well measured hi rotation curves @xmath12 ,",
    "the derived dm parameters come from published maximum - disk decompositions of @xmath12 into visible and dark components .",
    "the halo model used is the nonsingular isothermal . at absolute magnitude @xmath13@xmath14",
    ", @xmath15 is comparable to the velocity dispersion ; then rotation curve decomposition is impossible . for these dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) and dwarf magellanic irregular ( dim ) galaxies , we derive central dm densities using the jeans equation .",
    "we compare dm parameters with visible matter parameter correlations from kormendy & bender ( 2012 ) .",
    "they show that the parameter correlations of sph galaxies are continuous with the disks ( but not bulges ) of s0 galaxies .",
    "in essence , sph galaxies are bulgeless s0s",
    ". moreover , sph and s@xmath16im galaxies have similar structure at each @xmath8 .",
    "effective brightnesses decrease dramatically at @xmath8@xmath17@xmath9 ; this is used in figure3 here .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the main observational result of kormendy & freeman ( 2014 ) : dm halos of sc ",
    "im galaxies satisfy well defined scaling  laws .",
    "halos in less luminous galaxies have smaller core radii , higher central densities , and smaller velocity dispersions .",
    "this confirms previous analyses of smaller samples ( kormendy 1988 , 1990 ; kormendy & freeman 2004 ) .",
    "scaling laws provide new constraints on galaxy formation .",
    "for example :    halo density depends on collapse redshift @xmath18 as .",
    "thus  @xmath1 increases toward lower luminosities because fainter galaxies collapsed earlier .",
    "the dm correlations imply that dwarf galaxies formed at least @xmath19 earlier than giant spirals .",
    "correction for baryonic dm compression would make the `` pristine '' @xmath1 smaller for giant galaxies and would increase @xmath20 .    in figure3 ,",
    "smaller dwarfs have smaller stellar - to - dm ratios ; these are probably associated with baryon loss .",
    "the correlations in figure1 provide a way to estimate this baryon loss and the properties of dwarf galaxy halos .",
    "the jeans equation tells us the dm central density @xmath1 but not its core radius @xmath0 or velocity dispersion @xmath2 .",
    "so the top - right panel in figure1 correctly shows an offset of dsph+dim galaxies from the extrapolation of the fitted correlation .",
    "but the smallest galaxies with rotation curve decompositions have dm densities similar to those of the biggest dwarfs with jeans equation estimates .",
    "_ we assume that dsph+dim galaxies would lie on the extrapolation of the @xmath21 correlation for bright galaxies except for the effects of their enhanced baryon loss . _ the top - right panel of figure1 then tells us the @xmath22 shifts that bring dsph and dim galaxies onto the fitted relation .",
    "the top - left and bottom - left panels tell us the shifts in @xmath23 and @xmath24 that bring dsph@xmath16dim galaxies onto those relations .",
    "these shifts are applied in figure2 . in all panels , dsph and",
    "dim galaxy halos lie on the correlations for more massive galaxies .",
    "the @xmath25 shifts imply that almost - dark dwarfs are more massive  than we thought .",
    "their typical halo has @xmath5 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath7 km s@xmath6 , in remarkably good agreement with the value of @xmath10 where galaxies get dim in figure4 .",
    "figure 3 compares the central projected densities of dm halos with effective projected densities of stars .",
    "s@xmath16im@xmath16sph galaxies with @xmath8 @xmath9 form a sequence of decreasing baryon - to - dm density ratios at decreasing @xmath26 .",
    "we suggest that they form a sequence of decreasing baryon retention ( vs.  supernova - driven winds :  dekel & silk 1986 ) or decreasing baryon capture ( after cosmic reionization ) in smaller galaxies . for galaxies with present    @xmath27 ,",
    "the baryon depletion is estimated by @xmath22 in the caption of figure2 . if the stellar @xmath28 is similar in dwarfs and sc ",
    "im systems , then @xmath22 measures the mass of stars in dwarfs _ relative to the mass of stars in sc ",
    "im galaxies with halos of similar  @xmath1 .",
    "_ this agrees with their mass - to - light ratios , @xmath29 .",
    "these dwarfs are almost dark , probably because they lost more baryons than the ( also substantial ) loss from sc ",
    ". in dim galaxies , some baryons are still in cold gas , but this effect is fairly small .    also in figure 3 , projected ( not volume ! )  dm density @xmath30 is essentially independent of galaxy luminosity @xmath26 .",
    "this is a well known result ( kormendy & freeman 2004 ; spano et al .  2008 ; gentile et al .  2009 ; donato et al .",
    "2009 ; plana et al .",
    "it implies a faber - jackson ( 1976 ) relation of the form dm mass @xmath31 .",
    "finally , in figure 3 , bulges and elliptical galaxies have @xmath32 , more so at lower @xmath26 .",
    "kormendy ( 2009 ) and kormendy & bender ( 2012 ) suggest that they form a sequence of increasing dissipation in the formation of smaller galaxies .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable result in kormendy & freeman ( 2014 ) is shown in fig .",
    "it shows that rotation - curve decompositions reveal a robust , linear correlation between the maximum rotation velocity @xmath33 of baryonic disks and the outer circular velocity @xmath10 of test particles in their dm halos .",
    "it explicitly shows that @xmath34 km s@xmath6  at @xmath10@xmath170kms@xmath6 .",
    "in fact , baryons become unimportant at @xmath35 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this @xmath36 intercept agrees very well with the typical halo @xmath2 that we deduced in section2 .",
    "smaller galaxies are dim or dark .",
    "for example , the two extremely faint dsph galaxies in our sample , segue1 and coma , have @xmath10 values of about 16 km s@xmath6 .",
    "from the above results , we conclude that the range of visible matter content of @xmath5 km s@xmath6 dm halos is large .",
    "the ones with the most baryons rotate enough to allow rotation curve decomposition .",
    "the ones with the fewest baryons are barely discoverable .",
    "none of these galaxies `` know '' that they must retain @xmath371% of their baryons to be discoverable by us almost 14 billion years after they formed .",
    "moreover , as luminosity decreases toward barely discoverable galaxies , these dwarfs become much more numerous as well as much more nearly dominated by dm . and",
    "baryon depletion processes should be more efficient in smaller galaxies .",
    "all this suggests that there may exist a large population of objects that are even darker  too dark to be discovered by current techniques .",
    "this would help to solve the problem that such objects are predicted by cold dm theory but not seen in local - group - like environments ( moore 1999 ; klypin 1999 ) .",
