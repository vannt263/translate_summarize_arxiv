    "the two sets of the fredholm equations can be identical as long as the associated integration boundaries match each other between the two sides .",

    "moreover , the explicit result of the ground state energy obtained provides facilities to study universal nature of many - body phenomena . the local pair correlation for opposite spins can be calculated directly from the ground state energy by @xmath199 this naturally gives the 1d analog of the tan s adiabatic theorem @xcite through the relation @xmath200 where @xmath201 is called the universal contact , measuring the probability that two fermions with opposite spin stay together .",
