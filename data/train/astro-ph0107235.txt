    "a few also have extremely low equivalent width emission lines , and are known as bl lac objects .    what is responsible for these differences ? in this paper , we address this question , using the spectra of a representative sub - set of flat radio spectrum sources from the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum survey ( phfs ) .",
    "this survey consists of 323 sources with flux densities at 2.7 ghz of greater than 0.5 jy , and radio spectral indices @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) with @xmath9 as measured between 2.7 and 5.0 ghz ( drinkwater et al . 1997 ) .",

    "the dust properties would have to be unusual not to induce curvature in the spectra .",
    "thirdly , all quasars might have similar big blue bumps , but in the redder quasars , this big blue bump emission is swamped by a red synchrotron emission component from the radio jet ( eg .",

    "the reality of these differences will be addressed in the next section .",
    "the equivalent width measurements can be found in a machine readable table , included in the electronic edition of this paper .",
    "equivalent widths are plotted against continuum slope in fig  [ ewbk ] .",
    "histograms of equivalent widths for the blue and red sub - samples , and for the lbqs , are shown in figs  [ hist1 ] , [ mghist ] and [ hist2 ] .",
    "the two phfs quasars without measured redshifts ( both in the red sample ) are not included .",
    "are the differences between the red and blue sub - samples real ?",
    "the correlation between the equivalent width of h@xmath1 and the continuum slope is significant at the 99.2% level , using spearman s rank correlation test .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test confirms that the h@xmath1 equivalent width distributions of the two sub - samples are different at the 97% confidence level .",
    "the c  iii ] equivalent width distributions are marginally inconsistent ( at the 95% level ) .",
    "there are no other differences significant at the 95% confidence level .",
    "the two quasars without measured redshifts were excluded from this analysis .",
    "if we assume that they are of low enough redshift that h@xmath1 would have been seen , they increase the significance of the difference .",
    "no correlation was found between line flux ratios and colour .",
    "the correlation predicted by a dust model is , however , weak enough to be consistent with the observations .",
    "we have wide wavelength coverage , spectrophotometric spectra for three of the reddest pseudo power - law sources , however , from which we can measure balmer decrements . in all three ,",
    "the ratio of h@xmath7 to h@xmath1 is around 3.5 , consistent with no dust reddening .",
    "the continuum slope of the phfs samples correlates with the optical continuum luminosity ( fig  [ slope_lum ] ) .",
    "spearman s rank correlation test shows that this correlation is significant with 99.999% confidence .",
    "no significant correlation is seen between continuum slope and _ radio _ luminosity .    as the phfs is a flux limited sample , redshift and luminosity",
    "are strongly correlated .",
    "is this really a correlation against luminosity , or could it be a correlation against redshift ? to test this , the sample was subdivided into redshift bins .",
    "the median luminosity of the sources in each bin was calculated , and subtracted from all the sources in that bin .",
    "the resultant differential luminosities still correlated with colour , with 95% confidence . when the process was repeated with luminosity bins , no significant residual correlation was seen .",
    "we therefore conclude that the physical correlation is between colour and luminosity .",
    "a stronger correlation is seen between the _ emission - line _ luminosity and the continuum slope ( fig  [ slope_linelum ] ) .",
    "the correlation with c  iii ] luminosity is only significant at the 97% level , but the other correlations shown are significant with 99.99% confidence or better .",
    "how should the strength of the big blue bump affect the emission - line properties ?",
    "the big blue bump is normally ascribed to thermal emission from an accretion disk .",
    "the disk could be different in red and blue quasars .",
    "alternatively , the rest - frame uv / optical emission may be entirely synchrotron .",
    "red and blue quasars could have different electron energy spectra in the jet .",
    "either way , the emission - lines of red and blue quasars should be quite different , as the big blue bump emission dominates their photoionisation .",
    "we modelled the effect of varying the big blue bump size on the emission line , using the cloudy photoionisation code ( ferland 1996 ) .",
    "the broad emission - line region was modelled as a single plane - parallel slab of uniform hydrogen number density @xmath29 , and solar metallicity .",
    "the flux incident on the front of the slab at 500 nm wavelength was fixed at @xmath30 ( low ionisation model ) , @xmath31 ( medium ionisation model ) and @xmath32 ( high ionisation model ) .",
    "all these parameters are typical of published broad - line region models .",
    "cloudy s standard agn photoionising continuum was used .",
    "this is a power - law in the uv and optical , with exponential upper- and lower cut - offs , together with a second power - law in the x - rays : @xmath33 where @xmath34k , @xmath35 ryd and @xmath36 .",
    "the constant @xmath37 is set such that the slope of a power - law extrapolated between 2 kev and 250 nm rest - frame , @xmath38 , is @xmath39 .",
    "thus the hard x - ray fluxes of red and blue quasars are same , as suggested by the rosat observations of siebert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    all that we varied was the strength of the big blue bump , parameterised by @xmath40 .",
    "the equivalent widths of the strongest emission lines were calculated as a function of @xmath40 , for each of the three ionisation models .",
    "results are shown in fig  [ bbb ] .",
    "a few clear patterns emerge .",
    "h@xmath1 is weaker in weak bump quasars .",
    "this is expected , as it is predominantly photoionised by flux just shortward of the lyman limit , which is dominated by the big blue bump . c  iii ] and c  iv can be either weaker or stronger in weak bump quasars , depending on the ionisation state of the broad - line region .",
    "this too is expected , as the strength of the big blue bump affects the ionisation parameter , and hence the population of the different ionisation states of carbon .",
    "mg  ii becomes much stronger in weak bump quasars .",
    "mg  ii is a relatively low ionisation line , and is predominantly excited by x - rays penetrating deep into the emission - line clouds .",
    "thus an ionising continuum weak in uv photons but relatively strong in harder x - rays is ideal for mg  ii formation",
    ".    a more realistic model would allow for the stratified nature of the emission - line regions .",
    "it is also unlikely that the physical properties of the emission line region are uncorrelated with the colour of the continuum emission .",
    "normal dust models predict a strongly curved continuum in red quasars , and hence are not consistent with the photometry of the pseudo power - law sources ( fww ) .",
    "if the dust were deficient in small grains , however , the uv absorption would be reduced , and the predicted continuum emission could be brought into agreement with that observed .",
    "dust should affect the emission - line ratios , but should not affect the emission - line equivalent widths , as it should absorb line and continuum radiation equally .",
    "the exception to this would be where the dust is either patchy on scales comparable to the broad - line region , or where it is mixed in with the broad - line region .",
    "unified models suggest that we are observing flat radio spectrum quasars from close to the axis of their jets .",
    "any emission from these jets would thus be relativistically boosted .",
    "if these jets sometimes emitted a synchrotron component with very red colours in the optical , it could produce the red colours .",
    "whiting , webster & francis ( 2001 , hereafter wwf ) showed that a model of the continuum emission with two components ( a big blue bump and a red synchrotron component ) can reproduce the colours of the pseudo power - law sources as measured by fww , including the small ( but significant ) deviations from a pure power - law .",
    "the model also correctly predicts the polarisation properties of the small fraction of phfs quasars for which this data is available .",
    "if the synchrotron model is correct , there should be an anti - correlation between the equivalent widths of the emission lines and the redness of the continuum emission .",
    "this is because the emission - line flux of a quasar should be proportional to the strength of the big blue bump that photoionises it , and should not be affected by the strength of any red synchrotron emission component .",
    "the red component will have too little flux in the uv to ionise emission lines , and it is probably beamed , and hence will only illuminate a small part of the emission - line region . thus if the observed red continuum emission greatly exceeds the big blue bump , it will also greatly exceed the fluxes of the emission lines , which will hence have very low equivalent widths .",
    "the effect should be most marked for longer wavelength lines , as the red synchrotron component will be relatively stronger at longer wavelengths .",
    "line ratios should not correlate with colour .",
    "at short wavelengths , there are no significant differences between the emission - line equivalent widths of the red and blue sub - samples .",
    "h@xmath1 , however , shows a very significant difference , in the sense that most red sources have very weak lines .",
    "the data from [ o  iii ] are also consistent with this ( table  [ medians ] ) .",
    "lccc line & blue phfs quasars & red phfs quasars & ratio blue / red +   + c  iv & 3.3 nm & 2.7 nm & 1.2 + c  iii ] & 2.2 nm & 1.1 nm & 2.0 + mg  ii & 2.6 nm & 2.3 nm & 1.2 + h@xmath1 & 7.9 nm & 0.9 nm & 9.1 + @xmath20o  iii@xmath21 $ ] & 4.4 nm & 0.4 nm & 12.6 +   +    these results are consistent with the red synchrotron component model , if this red component is about ten times stronger than the blue component at @xmath41 nm wavelength , but no longer swamps the blue component at 300 nm .",
    "this implies a spectrum at least as red as a power - law of the form @xmath42 , which is consistent with the theoretical modelling of wwf .",
    "these results are not consistent with the dust model , which predicts no correlation between equivalent width and colour . neither are they consistent with the weak blue bump model , which predicts that mg  ii should be stronger in the red quasars , and that h@xmath1 should only be weaker by a factor of @xmath43 , not @xmath3 .",
    "let us therefore assume that the weakness of the lines of the red sub - sample is due primarily to dilution by a red synchrotron component .",
    "we detect the h@xmath1 line at @xmath24 confidence or better in all but one of the red quasars with decent data .",
    "the equivalent widths span roughly two orders of magnitude at rest frame 500 nm , with no obvious bimodality . in at most 10% of the red quasars can the red continuum component exceed the blue component by a factor of more than 100 , at rest - frame 500 nm .",
    "this too is consistent with the modelling of wwf .",
    "if the synchrotron model is correct , all red quasars should have low equivalent width emission - lines , and all quasars with very low equivalent widths should be red .",
    "the latter is consistent with our data , but as fig  [ ewbk ] shows , there are a small number of extremely red quasars with high equivalent width mg  ii lines .",
    "the spectra of the two most extreme red , strong - lined quasars are shown in fig  [ strongred ] . indeed , these red quasars have the highest equivalent width mg  ii emission - lines in the sample .",
    "these sources clearly do not fit into the simple synchrotron model .",
    "dust could redden the continuum without changing the equivalent widths .",
    "the balmer decrements of these sources are , however , @xmath44 , which is typical of unreddened agn .",
    "a weak big blue bump model fits the red colours and high mg  ii equivalent widths of these sources well .",
    "we therefore hypothesise that these quasars have intrinsically weak big blue bumps .",
    "note , however , that while the equivalent widths of these sources are anomalous , their line luminosities fit on the correlation with continuum slope ( fig  [ slope_linelum ] ) .",
    "the synchrotron model appears to best fit most of the spectra .",
    "what then determines the relative strength of the synchrotron and big blue bump components , and hence the quasar colours ?",
    "the continuum slope measured between 340 and 750 nm should be a good measure of the relative strength of the synchrotron and big blue bump components .",
    "emission - line luminosities should correlate strongly with the luminosity of the big blue bump which photoionises them .",
    "thus the correlations shown in both figs  [ slope_lum ] and [ slope_linelum ] suggest that the ratio of synchrotron emission to big blue bump flux is relatively high in quasars with low luminosity big blue bumps .",
    "this implies that in quasars with low luminosity big blue bumps , the fraction of the accretion energy going into the jet is relatively high , or that the jet emission extends to shorter wavelengths in these sources .",
    "the @xmath45 scatter in this correlation is 0.4 dex , which is better than the scatter in the baldwin effect .",
    "this correlation may thus be useful for cosmological distance scale work .",
    "bl lac objects are normally defined as having no observed emission lines with rest - frame equivalent widths greater than 0.5 nm ( eg .",
    "stickel et al .",
    "1991 , rector et al .",
    "2000 ) . in our model",
    ", this implies that the red synchrotron emission component exceeds the blue one at the line wavelength by a factor of @xmath3 .",
    "we do not see any bimodality in the distribution of equivalent factors , though our sub - sample is small .",
    "if confirmed , this would imply that radio selected bl lac objects are simply the tail of the normal population of flat radio spectrum quasars , and not a different class with intrinsically weaker emission lines .",
    "our analysis suggests that the synchrotron emission component is very red , and hence that it dilutes long wavelength lines far more effectively than short wavelength lines .",
    "this implies that bl lac samples are biassed against finding high redshift objects",
    ".    how significant could this bias be ? consider a model in which the red continuum component has a spectrum of the form @xmath2 , and the logarithm of the ratio of red to blue components at the wavelength of h@xmath1 is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2 , as suggested by our observations .",
    "the ratio of red to blue components at the wavelength of mg  ii will be 3.4 times smaller than at h@xmath1 , while at c  iii ] it will be 7.8 times smaller .",
    "it is assumed that the ratio of red to blue components does not correlate with redshift or luminosity .",
    "now consider , for example , a sample of bl lac objects chosen on the basis of spectra covering 400  600 nm .",
    "at redshift zero , the strongest line in this wavelength range will be h@xmath1 , which in blue phfs quasars has a rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath46 nm .",
    "for this line to have an observed equivalent width of less than 0.5 nm , we require that the red component at the wavelength of h@xmath1 exceed the blue component by a factor of ten . according to our model , 50% of all red quasars meet this criterion and would hence be classed as bl lac objects .    at redshift one ,",
    "however , mg  ii will be the strongest line within this observed wavelength region . in blue phfs quasars",
    ", mg  ii has a median rest - frame equivalent width of 3 nm . for the line to have a rest - frame equivalent width of less than 0.5 nm , we require that the red continuum component exceed the blue one by a factor of 6 at the wavelength of mg  ii .",
    "this implies that the red component must exceed the blue by a factor of @xmath47 at the wavelength of h@xmath1 . according to our model",
    ", only 35% of red quasars will meet this criterion . repeating this calculation at redshift two ( where c  iv is the strongest line ) ,",
    "only 6% of red phfs quasars would be classed as bl lac objects .",
    "thus any sample using spectra at a uniform observed - frame wavelength will miss @xmath48% of the bl lacs at redshift one , and @xmath49% at redshift two .",
    "our small sub - sample size makes these estimates highly uncertain .",
    "nonetheless , this is probably sufficient to cancel out the negative evolution claimed by some authors ( eg . rector et al .",
    "2000 ) , but not to match the enormous positive evolution seen in other classes of quasar .",
    "it has long been known that the optical spectra of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars are remarkably similar , despite the enormous difference in their radio luminosities . a number of small differences in the emission - line properties have been claimed ( eg .",
    "boroson & green 1992 , francis , hooper & impey 1993 , corbin & francis 1994 , corbin 1997 ) , but only on the basis of small , poorly matched and/or incomplete samples .",
    "these studies found that c  iv , c  iii ] and [ o  iii ] had higher equivalent widths in flat radio spectrum quasars than in radio - quiet quasars .",
    "the optical luminosity and redshift distribution of the lbqs are quite similar to those of the phfs quasars , so any differences between the emission - lines of the two samples must be physical . if we compare the spectra of the lbqs qsos with the blue phfs sub - sample , we find that the equivalent width distributions of c  iv , h@xmath1 and [ o  iii ] are significantly different , with 95% confidence .",

    "the equivalent widths of the blue phfs quasars are greater than those of the lbqs qsos .",
    "the red phfs quasars have significantly weaker mg  ii and h@xmath1 equivalent widths than the lbqs qsos , presumably due to dilution by the red synchrotron component .",
    "we conclude that the spectra of the red phfs quasars are significantly different from those of the blue phfs quasars .",
    "small number statistics make our conclusions tentative , though they are formally significant .",
    "the probable differences are consistent with a model in which the red colours are due to the addition of a featureless red synchrotron continuum component to an otherwise normal blue quasar spectrum , as proposed by wwf .",
    "the red component must have a spectrum at least as red as a power - law of the form @xmath2 .",
    "this red component contributes no more than half the continuum flux at rest - frame 300 nm , but at rest - frame 500 nm it contributes about 90% of the continuum flux of the red quasars .",
    "the physics of such a component is discussed by wwf .",
    "the relative strengths of the blue and red components span two orders of magnitude at rest - frame 500 nm .",
    "the blue component is relatively weaker in low optical luminosity sources .",
    "if this model is correct , then existing bl lac surveys are biassed against high redshift objects , though this bias is insufficient to bring the evolution of bl lacs into consistency with the evolution of other quasars .",
    "a few phfs quasars , however , have both very red colours and very high equivalent width emission - lines .",
    "these quasars do not easily fit the synchrotron model , but their properties can be fit by an intrinsically weak big blue bump model .",
    "we confirm that the emission - lines of optically selected qsos have significantly weaker equivalent widths than those of radio - loud , flat radio spectrum quasars with similar optical luminosities .",
    "digital copies of the composite spectra and of the measured equivalent widths are available from the on - line copy of this paper .",
