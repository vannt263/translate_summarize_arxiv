    "the forward - bacward asymmetry for the charged hadrons produced in @xmath1 annihilation at high energies in vicinity of the @xmath2 -boson mass has been the object of intensive theoretical and experimental investigation .",
    "it is interesting to make a theoretical analysis of this phenomenon for much higher enegies where the leading , double - logarithmic ( dl ) contributions come not only from integrating over virtual photon momenta but also from virtual @xmath3 and @xmath2 bosons .",
    "indeed , at the annihilation energies much higher than 100  gev , when masses of virtual electroweak bosons are small compared to their momenta , the initial @xmath4x@xmath5 symmetry is restored in a certain sense and accounting for higher loop dl contributions involving the @xmath6 bosons is nonless imporatnt than the standard accounting for the photon dl contributions . the value of the asymmetry at such energies would be expressed rather through the cazimir operators of the electroweak gauge group than through electric charges . in a sense , studing the forward - backward asymmetry at such enegries is one of the simplest ways to see the total effects of contributions of the electroweak radiative corrections of higher orders .",
    "our theoretical study can be useful in future when next linear colliders will explore @xmath1 annihilation at very high energies , probing further the standard model and eventually looking for new physics .    in accordance with the present theoretical conceptions , we divide investigation of the annihilation into two stages",
    ": first we calculate the sub - process : @xmath1 -annihilation into a quark - antiquark pair ( which is studied with perturbative methods ) and then , numerically , account for hadronization effects which are quite different for converting the quarks into mesons and barions .",
    "we consider @xmath1 annihilate into two hadronic jets in the kinematics when the leading particles of every jet goes in cmf close to the beam axis , so they are within the cones with opening angles @xmath7 and the axes around the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions .",
    "we obtain that the forward - backward asymmetry manifests itself as follows : the number of the hadrons with the positive electric charges , @xmath10 in the cone around the @xmath9 -direction exeeds the number of the negatively charged hadrons , @xmath11 ( see ref .",
    "it is depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "the opposite effect is true for the other cone , around the @xmath8 direction .",
    "the space outside of the cones is neutral .",
    "the numerical evaluations of the asymmetry are plotted in fig .  2 separately for the produced mesons and barions .",
    "in particular , fig.2 shows that the value of the asymmetry is high enouph to be measured at energies @xmath12  tev and grows steeply with energy .",
    "in order to arrive at this result , let us consider first the basic sub - process of the annihilation : @xmath13 annihilation into a quark @xmath14 and its antiparticle @xmath15 .",
    "all these particles can belong either to the @xmath4 doublets or to the singlets .",
    "our first goal is to calculate the scattering amplitudes of the annihilation in the @xmath16- kinematics where @xmath17 and in the @xmath18- kinematics : @xmath19    in order to account for dl contributions to all orders in the electroweak couplings , we use the evolution equations with respect to the infrared cut - off . this cut - off @xmath20 is chosen in the transverse momentum space so that momenta of all virtual particles obey @xmath21    although only the feynman graphs vith virtual photons can have the infrared divergencies , it is convenient to keep the restriction  ( [ m ] ) for momenta of all virtual particles , assuming that @xmath22    with assumptions of eqs .",
    "( [ m][mwz ] ) , one can neglect all masses and be safe of the infrared singularities at the same moment . on the other hand , the scattering amplitudes now depend on @xmath20 .",
    "it makes possible to evolute them in @xmath20 and to put @xmath23 in the final expressions .",
    "as dl contributions appear in the regions where @xmath24 obey the strong inequalities of the kind @xmath25 , it is always possible to find the virtual particle with minimal @xmath26 transverse momentum in every such a region .",
    "obviously , only integration over @xmath27 involves @xmath20 as the lowest limit .",
    "integrations over other transverse momenta are @xmath20-independent .",
    "dl contributions of the softest particles can be factorized .",
    "it allows to compose infrared evolution equations ( iree ) for the scattering amplitudes .",
    "the most difficult is the case when both the initial electron and the final quark belong to the @xmath4 doublets . in order to simplify the iree",
    ", one can use the @xmath4 simmetry restored at such high energies and consider annihilation of lepton - antilepton pair into a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "after that , it is convenient to exapand the scattering amplitude into the sum of the irreducible @xmath4 representations , using the standard projection operators multiplied by the invariant amplitudes @xmath28 . at last , in order to calculate the invariant amplitudes in kinematics ( [ tkin ] , [ ukin ] ) , it is convenient to use the mellin transform @xmath29 where @xmath30 for @xmath31 in kinematics ( [ tkin ] ) and @xmath32 when the kinematics is the @xmath18 -inematics of eq .",
    "( [ tkin ] ) . in the case of the collinear kinematics where @xmath33 , amplitudes @xmath34 obey ( we consider amplitudes with the positive signatures only ) : @xmath35 ^ 2 ~,\\ ] ] with @xmath36 being numerical factors : @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eqfj ] ) can be expressed in terms of the parabolic cylinder functions @xmath40 :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    when the scattering angles are becoming larger so that    @xmath44    the invariant amplitudes @xmath31 are expressed in terms of @xmath34 in the following way :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and factors @xmath47 can be taken from ref .",
    "@xcite :    @xmath48    the factor @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ mpostu ] ) is the sudakov form factor .",
    "actually it is a product of the sudakov form factors of the leptons and of the quarks . as follows from eqs .",
    "( [ bj],[hj ] ) , due to the gauge invariance , it does not depend on @xmath50 , i.e. is same for all invariant amplitudes .",
    "it can be seen also explicitly from eqs .",
    "( [ bj],[hj ] ) ,    @xmath51 ~.\\ ] ]    this form factor accumulates dl contributions of soft virtual ew bosons and vanishes in the final expressions for the cross sections when bremsstrahlung of soft ew bosons with the cmf energies @xmath52 , @xmath53 , is taken into account .    according to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the amplitude for the forward @xmath54 -annihilation , @xmath55 is expressed in terms of amplitudes @xmath56 of eq .",
    "( [ mpostu ] ) :    @xmath57    whereas the backward amplitude @xmath58 for the same quarks is equal to the amplitude @xmath59 of eq .",
    "( [ mpostu ] ) :    @xmath60    similarly , the forward amplitude @xmath61 for @xmath62 is    @xmath63    while the backward amplitude for this process is    @xmath64    we use the folloing terminology : by the forward kinematics for @xmath65 -annihilation we mean that quarks with positive electric charges , @xmath18 and @xmath66 , are produced around the initial @xmath9 - beam , in the cmf , within a cone with a small opening angle @xmath67 ,    @xmath68    by backward kinematics we means just the opposite  the electric charge scatters backwards in a cone with the same opening angles .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath69 for the forward annihilation is    @xmath70 \\equiv d\\sigma^{(0)}\\,\\left[f_u + f_d\\right ]   ~,\\ ] ]    and similarly , the differential cross section @xmath71 for the backward annihilation is    @xmath72 \\equiv d\\sigma^{(0)}\\ , \\left[b_u + b_d\\right],\\ ] ]    where @xmath73 stands for the born cross section , though without couplings.we define the forward - backward asymmetry as : @xmath74 where    @xmath75    contributions to the asymmetry from right leptons and quarks can be ealily obtained in a similar way .",
    "then , using the standard programmes for hadronisation@xcite and doing numerical calculations , we obtain the forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath1 annihilation into charged mesons and barions .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .  2 .    finally , we would like to note that when the annihilation energy is high enouph to produce , in addition to the two quark jets , @xmath3 or @xmath2 bosons with energies @xmath76 100  gev , it turnes out that the cross section @xmath77 of @xmath78 hard photon production , the cross section @xmath79 of @xmath80 boson production and the cross section @xmath81 of @xmath82 boson production obey very simple asymptotical relations ( see ref .",
