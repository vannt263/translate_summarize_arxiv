    "recently , wouters and brun ( wb )  @xcite proposed a new method to detect photon - alp oscillations taking place in turbulent extra - galactic magnetic fields when very - high - energy observations of blazars are performed .",
    "actually , the extra - galactic magnetic field @xmath0 is supposed to have a domain - like structure , with its direction randomly changing from one domain to the next and strength either equal in all domains or with a kolmogorov spectrum . for simplicity",
    ", we shall restrict our attention throughout this paper to the first option .",
    "manifestly , in such a situation the propagation process of the photon / alp beam from the source to us becomes a stochastic process . while it is obvious that the beam follows a single trajectory at once joining the source to us , the exact behavior of the beam",
    "can not be predicted but only its mean properties can be evaluated , and this requires an average over a very large number of possible trajectories followed by the beam ( realizations of the stochastic process in question ) . among these properties ,",
    "the simplest ones are the average photon survival probability  @xcite and its variance  @xcite .",
    "the main point made by wb is that in a pretty small range about the energy @xmath1 that marks the transition from the weak to the strong mixing regime the photon survival probability along every single trajectory that the beam can follow exhibits fluctuations , which show up in the observed energy spectrum and are claimed to be an _",
    "observable _ signature of the existence of photon - alp oscillations . incidentally , in the same energy range also the average photon survival probability oscillates  @xcite .    in our opinion",
    ", a flaw of the considered paper is that wb do not state explicitly their assumptions , neither they provide any information about the way they evaluate the photon survival probability along a single trajectory .",
    "do they consider a polarized beam or an unpolarized one ? as we will see below , this point is of crucial importance because it changes drastically the result , but nothing is said about that by wb .",
    "quoting a famous statement of georg uhlenbeck `` first the assumptions , then the result '' !",
    "we explicitly show that they consider an initially _ polarized _ beam , whereas a physically correct treatment demands the beam to be initially _",
    "unpolarized_. as a consequence , the result of wb changes _ completely_.",
    "specifically , writing the photon - alp lagrangian as @xmath2 the definition of @xmath1 is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the alp mass , @xmath5 is the plasma frequency and @xmath6 is the component of the magnetic field transverse to the beam ( wb write @xmath7 in place of @xmath8 ) , which is supposed to be monochromatic of energy @xmath9 .",
    "a very remarkable fact is that under the assumption @xmath10 the beam propagation equation in a generic magnetic domain @xmath11 takes a schrdinger - like form in the variable @xmath12 along the beam  @xcite , to wit @xmath13 with the wave function of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the photon amplitudes with polarization ( electric field ) along the @xmath17- and @xmath18-axis , respectively , while @xmath19 is the amplitude associated with the alp in the @xmath11-th domain .",
    "further , we let @xmath20 be the angle between @xmath6 and the fixed @xmath21 direction  equal for all domains  in the @xmath11-th domain . in the general case",
    "in which the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) is important a fraction of photons gets absorbed through the process @xmath22 and the mixing matrix @xmath23 reads @xmath24 the various delta terms are defined as follows : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the photon means free path for @xmath22 scattering  @xcite .    hence , we see that inside every domain the considered beam is formally described as a three - level unstable non - relativistic quantum system .    in the simplest case of a single domain with @xmath0 homogeneous , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "the @xmath33 conversion probability is @xmath34 having set @xmath35 . for a photon beam linearly polarized along @xmath6 we have @xmath36 , for a linear polarization perpendicular to @xmath6 we get @xmath37 , whereas for an unpolarized beam it turns out that @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , eq . ( [ a6 ] ) shows that for @xmath9 sufficiently larger than @xmath1 @xmath39 becomes maximal and energy - independent , which is indeed the strong mixing regime .",
    "so , we see that the question whether the beam is polarized or not is of crucial importance because it _ changes _ drastically the conclusion .",
    "our main criticism indeed concerns the beam polarization . we want to emphasize that the beam polarization is _",
    "unknown_. a reason is that it is not clear whether the emission mechanism is leptonic or hadronic , and for instance in the pure synchro - self - compton model ( without external electrons ) the polarization of the emitted photons decreases both with the electron energy and the viewing angle , so that it is vanishingly small for the tev bl lacs  @xcite .",
    "another reason is that the polarization can not be measured in the @xmath40-ray band .",
    "so , in the lack of any information about the beam polarization the only sensible option is to suppose that the beam is initially _",
    "unpolarized_.    hence , according to quantum mechanics in the @xmath11-th domain the beam _ must _ be described by a polarization density matrix , namely @xmath41 rather than by a wave function @xmath42 like the one in eq .",
    "( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the analogy with non - relativistic quantum mechanics entails that @xmath43 obeys the von neumann - like equation @xmath44 associated with eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] )  @xcite .",
    "observe that even though the hamiltonian is not self - adjoint , we always have @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the transfer matrix , namely the solution of eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) subject to the initial condition @xmath47 .",
    "assuming that the number of domains is @xmath48 , the transfer matrix describing the whole propagation process is @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the photon survival probability along a _",
    "single _ realization of the _ unpolarized _ beam corresponding to @xmath52 is given by  @xcite @xmath53 while the analogous probability in the case of a _",
    "polarized _ beam along the @xmath17-axis reads  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55",
    "let us consider first the case in which ebl absorption is absent , so that the hamiltonian is self - adjoint and the transfer matrix must be unitary . since we can not know the specific trajectory followed by the beam during its propagation",
    ", this has to be true for _ any _ trajectory .",
    "now , by inserting eqs .",
    "( [ a12 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ a11 ] ) and working out the resulting expression we find @xmath56 but owing to the unitarity of @xmath57 , the condition @xmath58 implies @xmath59 entails @xmath60 ) yield @xmath61 this conclusion is in blatant contradiction with the result of wb reported in the upper panel of their fig . 2 , and",
    "so we infer that wb consider an initially _ polarized _ beam .",
    "from now on we address the case in which the ebl absorption is present .    as a benchmark for comparison ,",
    "we start by dealing with the photon survival probability along a single randomly chosen trajectory of the considered stochastic process in the case of an initially _ polarized _ beam . for the sake of comparison with wb",
    ", we take the same values of the parameters adopted by them , namely a source at redshift @xmath62 ( not to be confused with the coordinate along the beam ) , the magnetic field strength @xmath63 , the size of a magnetic domain equal to @xmath64 , the photo - alp coupling @xmath65 and the alp mass @xmath66 . using eq .",
    "( [ a11q ] ) , we find the result plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] .",
    "manifestly fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] is qualitatively identical to the lower panel of fig . 2 of wb .",
    "this circumstance confirms that wb indeed consider an initially _ polarized _ beam .",
    "let us next address the analogous probability  for the same values of the parameters  in the case of an initially _ unpolarized _ beam , which is the physically correct case .",
    "employing now eq .",
    "( [ a11 ] ) , the corresponding result is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : unpol ] .",
    "evidently the size of the fluctuations is _ drastically reduced _ in the unpolarized case with respect to the polarized one .    just to show that such a conclusion is general  and",
    "not a particular feature of the selected trajectory ",
    "we take another randomly chosen trajectory . repeating the above calculations in this case , the result for an initially polarized beam",

    "explicitly , as a first step we generate photons by a monte carlo method according to a log - parabola probability distribution ",
    "shape of the initial spectrum  with an integrated flux in the tev band at the crab level .",
    "we simulate an observation of 50 h with an effective area of @xmath67 , which amounts to about 100000 photons .",
    "we suppose that 10 observations of 5 h each are performed , so that every one collects about 10000 photons . assuming that the observations are performed in the energy band @xmath68",
    ", we divide this range into 33 energy bins . at this point , we bin the 10 observations , computing both the mean and the variance pertaining to the 10 observations for each of the 33 energy bins .",
    "next , we perform a log - log best fit of the binned points and we evaluate the fit residuals .",
    "finally , we compute the variance of the fit residuals . all this is obtained by averaging over 5000 realizations , as in the case of wb .    we proceed in parallel with the discussion in sect .",
