    "the topic at hand is perverse sheaves and nearby cycles ; for greater accessibility of these notes , we give a summary of the definitions and necessary properties here .",
    "occasionally , we indicate diagram chases in a proof . for ease of reading we have tried not to make this an essential point , but in case the reader should find such a chase to be a convincing informal argument",
    ", we indicate here why it is also a convincing formal one .",
    "every object in an abelian category @xmath3 can be considered , via yoneda s lemma , to be a sheaf , namely its functor of points , on the _ canonical topology _ of @xmath3 .",
    "this is , by definition , the largest grothendieck topology in which all representable functors @xmath4 are sheaves , and its open covers are precisely the _ universal strict epimorphisms_. such a map is , in a more general category , a map @xmath5 such that the fibered product @xmath6 exists , the coequalizer @xmath7 exists , the natural map @xmath8 is an isomorphism , and that all of this is _ also _ true when we make any base change along a map @xmath9 , for the induced map @xmath10 . in an abelian category , however , this is all equivalent merely to the statement that @xmath11 is a surjection .",
    "recall the definitions of the various constructions on sheaves :    1 .",
    "kernels of maps are taken sectionwise ; i.e.  for a map @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "likewise , products and limits are taken sectionwise .",
    "cokernels are _ locally _ taken sectionwise : any section @xmath14 is , on some open cover @xmath15 of @xmath16 , of the form @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "likewise , images , coproducts , and colimits are taken locally .    in an abelian category , where all of these constructions exist by assumption , these descriptions",
    "are even prescriptive : if one forms the sheaves thus described , they are representable by the objects claimed .",
    "therefore , the following common arguments in diagram chasing are valid :    1 .",
    "a map @xmath19 is surjective if and only if for every @xmath20 , there is some @xmath21 such that @xmath22 .",
    "this is code for : for every `` open set '' @xmath16 and every @xmath23 , there is a surjection @xmath24 and a section @xmath25 such that @xmath26 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath20 , then @xmath27 if and only if @xmath28 .",
    "this is code for : if @xmath23 and @xmath29 , then there is some surjection @xmath24 and @xmath30 with @xmath26 .",
    "3 .   for @xmath31 , @xmath32 if and only if @xmath33 . here , the sum of maps @xmath34 and @xmath35 is obtained by forming the fibered product @xmath36 which covers both @xmath16 and @xmath15 , and then taking the sum of the maps @xmath37 ; the condition for equality is just the statement that a section of a sheaf vanishes if only it vanishes on an open cover .",
    "any other arguments involving elements and some concept related to exactness can also be phrased in this way .",
    "thus , a nave diagram - chasing argument can be converted into a rigorous one simply by replacing statements like @xmath38 with correct ones @xmath39 for some open set @xmath16 , and passing to surjective covers of @xmath16 when necessary .",
    "all the action takes place in the derived category ; specifically , let @xmath40 be an algebraic variety and denote by @xmath41 its derived category of bounded complexes of sheaves of vector spaces with constructible cohomology . by definition , a map of complexes @xmath42 defines an isomorphism in @xmath41 if and only if its associated map on cohomology sheaves @xmath43 is an isomorphism for all @xmath44 .",
    "we have a notation for the index - shift : @xmath45)^i$ ] ( technically , the differential maps also change sign , but we will never need to think about this ) .",
    "the derived category @xmath41 is a `` triangulated category '' , which means merely that in it are a class of triples , called `` distinguished triangles '' , of complexes and maps @xmath46\\ ] ] in which two consecutive arrows compose to zero , satisfying the axioms given in , for example , @xcite ( but see also [ sec : comments ] ) , and with the property that the associated long sequence of cohomology sheaves @xmath47 is exact ( note that @xmath48 ) = h^1(a^\\bullet)$ ] ) ; we say that the @xmath49 are `` cohomological '' . if @xmath42 is given , there always exists a triangle whose third term @xmath50 is the `` cone '' of @xmath11 ; this cone is unique up to nonunique isomorphism and any commutative diagram of maps @xmath11 induces a map on cones , but this is not functorial .",
    "it follows that the induced triangle itself is unique up to a nonunique isomorphism whose component morphisms on @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the identity maps .",
    "a functor between two triangulated categories is `` triangulated '' if it sends triangles in one to triangles in the other .",
    "in @xmath41 we also have some standard constructions of sheaf theory .",
    "for any two complexes there is the `` total tensor product '' @xmath53 obtained by taking in degree @xmath54 the direct sum of all products @xmath55 with @xmath56 ( and some differentials that are irrelevant ) and its derived bifunctor @xmath57 , with @xmath58 , which is a triangulated functor in each variable .",
    "we also have the bifunctor ( contravariant in the first argument ) @xmath59 , whose terms are @xmath60|_u)$ ] , and its derived bifunctor @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , which is triangulated in each variable .",
    "of course , these two have an adjunction : @xmath63    for any zariski - open subset @xmath64 with inclusion map @xmath65 , there are triangulated functors @xmath66 and",
    "@xmath67 ; if @xmath44 is the inclusion of its complement @xmath68 , then there are likewise maps @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "( technically the operation @xmath71 is only left exact on sheaves and we should write @xmath72 for its derived functor , but we will never have occasion to use the plain version so we elide this extra notation . )",
    "they satisfy a number of important relations , of which we will only use one here : there is a functorial triangle in the complex @xmath73 : @xmath74 we will generally forget about writing @xmath75 and consider @xmath76 .    there is also a triangulated duality functor @xmath77 which interchanges @xmath78 and @xmath79 , in that @xmath80 , etc . , and is an involution . in fact , if we set @xmath81 , then @xmath82 .",
    "for any map @xmath83 of varieties , we have @xmath84 as well ( also @xmath85 , and none of them are equal ) , with the same relationships to @xmath2 , and the useful identity @xmath86 note that by these properties , we have @xmath87 .      here",
    "we give a detail - free overview of the formalism of perverse sheaves created in @xcite .",
    "within @xmath41 there is an abelian category @xmath88 of `` perverse sheaves '' which has nicer properties than the category of actual sheaves .",
    "it is specified by means of a `` t - structure '' , namely , a pair of full subcategories @xmath89 and @xmath90 , also satisfying some conditions we wo nt use , and such that @xmath91 there are truncation functors @xmath92 and likewise for @xmath93 , fitting into a distinguished triangle for any complex @xmath73 : @xmath94 ( where @xmath95 \\circ \\tau^{\\geqslant 0 } \\circ [ 1]$ ] ) .",
    "this triangle is _ unique _ with respect to the property that the first term is in @xmath96 and the third is in @xmath97 .",
    "they have the obvious properties implied by the notation : @xmath98 if @xmath99 , and likewise for @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore , there are `` perverse cohomology '' functors @xmath101 , where of course @xmath102)$ ] and @xmath103 ; these are cohomological just like the ordinary cohomology functors .",
    "the abelian category structure of @xmath88 is more or less determined by the fact that if we have a map @xmath12 of perverse sheaves ( this is the notation we will be using ; we will not think of perverse sheaves as complexes ) , then @xmath104 for notational convenience , we will write @xmath105 for a perverse sheaf on @xmath16 , @xmath106 for one on @xmath40 , and as usual , abandon @xmath75 and just consider @xmath107 ( for the reason expressed immediately below , this is reasonable ) .    the category @xmath88 is closed under the duality functor @xmath2 , but not necessarily under the six functors defined for an open / closed pair of subvarieties",
    ". however , it is true that @xmath108 and @xmath109 , while @xmath110 ( @xmath111 a perverse sheaf on @xmath68 ) ; we say these functors are right , left , or just `` t - exact '' .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath65 is an affine morphism ( the primary example being when @xmath68 is a cartier divisor ) , both @xmath112 and @xmath71 are t - exact , and thus their restriction to @xmath113 is exact with values in @xmath88 .",
    "there is also a `` minimal extension '' functor @xmath114 , defined so that @xmath115 is the image of @xmath116 in @xmath117 along the natural map @xmath118 ; it is the unique perverse sheaf such that @xmath119 and @xmath120 , but for us the most useful property is that when @xmath65 is an affine , open immersion , then we have a sequence of _ perverse sheaves _",
    "@xmath121 \\incl j _ !",

    "perverse sheaves have good category - theoretic properties : @xmath88 is both artinian and noetherian , so every perverse sheaf has finite length .",
    "finally , we will use the sheaf - theoretic fact that if @xmath124 is a locally constant sheaf on @xmath40 , then @xmath125 is perverse whenever @xmath106 is .",
    "note that since @xmath124 is locally free , it is flat , and therefore @xmath126 .",
    "if we have a map @xmath127 such that @xmath128 ( so @xmath129 ) , the `` nearby cycles '' functor @xmath130 is defined .",
    "namely , let @xmath131 be the universal cover of @xmath132 , let @xmath133 be its pullback , forming a diagram @xmath134_{v } \\ar[dd ]",
    "\\\\    z \\ar[r]^i \\ar[dd ] & x \\ar[dd]^f & u \\ar[l]_{j } \\ar[dd ] &                                   \\\\                       &              &                        & { \\tilde{\\gm } } \\ar[dl]^{u }        \\\\",
    "\\{0\\ } \\ar[r ]        & \\aff^1       & \\gm \\ar[l ]             &    } \\ ] ] and set ( in this one instance , explicitly writing @xmath71 and @xmath135 as non - derived functors ) @xmath136 since @xmath137 and @xmath138 are exact , indeed @xmath139 is a left - exact functor from sheaves on @xmath16 to sheaves on @xmath68 .",
    "many sources ( e.g.  @xcite*1.1.1 ) give the definition @xmath140 ; in fact , they are the same : since @xmath141 is a covering map , if @xmath106 is a flasque sheaf on @xmath16 , then @xmath142 is flasque on @xmath143 and so acyclic for @xmath135 ( and @xmath144 acyclic for @xmath71 ) .",
    "therefore we may form the derived functor before or after composition .",
    "note that @xmath141 is not an algebraic map , and therefore it is not _ a priori _ clear whether @xmath145 preserves constructibility ; that it does is a theorem of deligne ( @xcite , expos xiii , thorme 2.3 for tale sheaves and expos xiv , thorme 2.8 for the comparison with classical nearby cycles ) .",
    "the fundamental group @xmath146 acts on any @xmath147 via deck transformations of @xmath148 and therefore acts on @xmath139 and @xmath145 .",
    "there is a natural map @xmath149 , obtained from @xmath150-adjunction , on whose image @xmath146 acts trivially .",
    "we set , by definition , @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the `` vanishing cycles '' sheaf .",
    "using some homological algebra tricks the above sequence induces a natural distinguished triangle @xmath153 where @xmath154 is ( morally ) the right derived functor of @xmath155 . like @xmath145",
    ", @xmath154 has a monodromy action of @xmath146 ; this action is one of the maps on the cone of the above triangle induced by the monodromy action on @xmath145 , but as this is not functorial , one should consult the real definition in @xcite ( given for the algebraic nearby cycles , but see also the second expos ) .",
    "lemunipotent nearby cycles there exists a unique decomposition of @xmath145 as @xmath156 , where for any choice of generator @xmath157 of @xmath146 , @xmath158 acts nilpotently on @xmath159 for any complex @xmath160 and is an automorphism of @xmath161 .",
    "the part @xmath162 is called the functor of _ unipotent nearby cycles_.    to start , we observe that for any sheaf @xmath106 on @xmath16 , we have @xmath163 , and so if @xmath106 is constructible , by the constructibility of nearby cycles so is @xmath164 ; thus , for any open @xmath165 , @xmath166 is finite - dimensional .",
    "let @xmath167 be the subfunctor such that for any sheaf @xmath106 on @xmath16 , @xmath168 is the subsheaf of @xmath164 in which @xmath158 is nilpotent , so for each @xmath15 , @xmath169 is the generalized eigenspace of @xmath157 with eigenvalue @xmath170 .",
    "therefore it is actually a direct summand ; we recall the general argument which works over any field @xmath171 .",
    "if @xmath172 is an endomorphism of a finite - dimensional vector space @xmath173 , we view @xmath173 as a @xmath174$]-module with @xmath175 acting as @xmath172 . by the classification of modules over a principal ideal domain , we have @xmath176/p(x)$ ] for certain polynomials @xmath177 .",
    "the generalized eigenspace with eigenvalue @xmath170 is then the sum of those pieces for which @xmath177 is a power of @xmath178 , and the remaining summands are a @xmath172-invariant complement in which @xmath179 acts invertibly . as the image of @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) ,",
    "this complement is functorial in the category of finite - dimensional @xmath174$]-modules and so we have the same decomposition in sheaves of finite - dimensional @xmath174$]-modules .",
    "specializing again to the present situation , we get a decomposition @xmath182 ( this is the definition of @xmath183 ) .",
    "both summands are _ a fortiori _ left - exact functors and taking derived functors , we obtain a decomposition : @xmath184 since @xmath158 is nilpotent on any @xmath168 , we may apply @xmath185 to any constructible complex of injectives , thus computing @xmath159 for any complex @xmath160 , and conclude that @xmath158 is nilpotent on each such ; by general principles it is invertible on @xmath161 .",
    "this is what we want .",
    "uniqueness of the decomposition is clear ; indeed , if in any category with a zero object we have objects @xmath175 and @xmath186 together with endomorphisms @xmath187 and @xmath188 respectively such that @xmath187 is nilpotent and @xmath188 invertible , then any map @xmath189 intertwining @xmath187 and @xmath188 is zero : we have @xmath190 , so @xmath191 if @xmath192 . for morphisms @xmath193 we work in the opposite category .",
    "in particular , if we have @xmath194 as a sum of two functors as in the statement of the lemma , then the identity map on @xmath145 has no @xmath195-component on @xmath162 and no @xmath196-component on @xmath161 , and so induces isomorphisms @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "we note that this lemma is a special case of [ nearby cycles decomposition ] when the field of coefficients is algebraically closed . however , this decomposition is defined over any field .",
    "there is a triangle , functorial in @xmath199 , @xmath200 ( see ) which , taking @xmath201 and inserting @xmath162 because the monodromy acts trivially on the first term , gives the extremely important ( for us ) triangle @xmath202 we also have a unipotent part of the vanishing cycles functor @xmath154 , and , again since the monodromy acts trivially on @xmath203 , a corresponding triangle @xmath204 if @xmath124 is any locally constant sheaf on @xmath205 with underlying vector space @xmath206 and unipotent monodromy , then @xmath207 , where @xmath146 acts on the tensor product by acting on each factor ( since @xmath124 is trivialized on @xmath148 ) .",
    "we note the following fact , crucial to all computations in this paper :    _ @xmath65 is an affine morphism .",
    "_    indeed , @xmath68 is cut out by a single algebraic equation .",
    "although when @xmath68 is any cartier divisor it is still locally defined by equations @xmath11 and the inclusion @xmath65 of its complement is again an affine morphism , it is not necessarily possible to glue nearby cycles which are locally defined as above ; c.f .",
    "@xcite*remark 5.5.4 ; an explicit example will appear in @xcite .",
    "however , it follows from [ nearby cycles computations ] that when @xmath105 is a perverse sheaf and @xmath208 has trivial monodromy , it is in fact independent of @xmath11 and gluing is indeed possible .",
    "triangle [ eq : psiun ] already implies that nearby cycles preserve perverse sheaves .",
    "lemnearby cycles are perverse the functor @xmath209 $ ] sends @xmath210 to @xmath211 and takes @xmath113 to @xmath212 .    since @xmath65 is affine and an open immersion , @xmath71 and @xmath112 are t - exact , so for any @xmath213 , @xmath214 is in @xmath215 .",
    "if we apply the long exact sequence of perverse cohomology to triangle [ eq : psiun ] , we therefore get in nonnegative degrees : @xmath216 for @xmath217 , the map @xmath218 is both given by a _",
    "nilpotent _ operator and is surjective , so zero .",
    "it follows that @xmath219 , as promised .",

    "@xmath223 , then , we have @xmath224 this means that for @xmath225 , all the maps @xmath158 are injective and nilpotent , hence zero",
    ". thus @xmath226 , as desired .",
    "since @xmath209 $ ] acts on perverse sheaves , we will give it the abbreviated notation @xmath227 .",
    "let @xmath228 be the vector space of dimension @xmath229 together with the action of a matrix @xmath230 $ ] , a unipotent ( variant of a ) jordan block of dimension @xmath231 .",

    "it has the following self - duality properties , where @xmath237 is the dual local system and @xmath238 is the local system in whose monodromy @xmath157 acts by @xmath239 :    lemjordan block dual we have @xmath240 , and @xmath241 for @xmath242 .",
    "since @xmath243 is the local system with vector space the dual @xmath244 and monodromy @xmath245 , its monodromy is again unipotent with a single jordan block of length @xmath231 .",

    "the same proof shows that @xmath250 .    in general ,",

    "from [ nearby cycles are perverse ] we know that @xmath268 is perverse ; then the long exact sequence of perverse cohomology associated to either distinguished triangle in ( upper cap ) shows that , in fact , @xmath587 is perverse , and thus those triangles correspond to exact sequences as in [ xi sequences ] .",
    "the equations @xmath596 and @xmath597 can then be read off from the commutativity of the upper and lower triangles . since the vertical arrows come from ( lower cap ) ,",
    "these distinguished triangles are uniquely determined up to isomorphism fixing @xmath598 and @xmath268 , as desired .",

    "this gives the quadruple for @xmath613 ; for @xmath614 , we dualize , since @xmath286 and @xmath141 are dual by their definition in propositions and . that the natural map is given by @xmath601 follows from the fact that this does define a map @xmath615 in the gluing category , and that its restriction to @xmath16 is the identity .    for @xmath115 , we use the fact that it is the image of the natural map @xmath600 ; having already identified all the parties , this is clear from the quadruples just obtained .    for the identification of @xmath587 ,",

    "<S> the titular , foundational work of beilinson not only gives a technique for gluing perverse sheaves but also implicitly contains constructions of the nearby and vanishing cycles functors of perverse sheaves . </S>",
    "<S> these constructions are completely elementary and show that these functors preserve perversity and respect verdier duality on perverse sheaves . </S>",
    "<S> the work also defines a new , `` maximal extension '' functor , which is left mysterious aside from its role in the gluing theorem . in these notes </S>",
    "<S> , we present the complete details of all of these constructions and theorems .    in this paper we discuss alexander beilinson s `` how to glue perverse sheaves '' @xcite with three goals . </S>",
    "<S> the first arose from a suggestion of dennis gaitsgory that the author study the construction of the unipotent nearby cycles functor @xmath0 which , as beilinson observes in his concluding remarks , is implicit in the proof of his key lemma 2.1 . here </S>",
    "<S> , we make this construction explicit , since it is invaluable in many contexts not necessarily involving gluing . </S>",
    "<S> the second goal is to restructure the presentation around this new perspective ; in particular , we have chosen to eliminate the two - sided limit formalism in favor of the straightforward setup indicated briefly in @xcite*4.2 for d - modules . </S>",
    "<S> we also emphasize this construction as a simple demonstration that @xmath1 $ ] and verdier duality @xmath2 commute , and de - emphasize its role in the gluing theorem . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we provide complete proofs ; with the exception of the key lemma , @xcite provides a complete program of proof which is not carried out in detail , making a technical understanding of its contents more difficult given the density of ideas . </S>",
    "<S> this paper originated as a learning exercise for the author , so we hope that in its final form it will be helpful as a learning aid for others . </S>",
    "<S> we do not intend it to supplant , but merely to supplement , the original , and we are grateful to beilinson for his generosity in permitting this .    </S>",
    "<S> the author would like to offer three additional thanks : to gaitsgory , who explained how this beautiful construction can be understood concretely , thus providing the basis for the perspective taken here ; to sophie morel , for confirming the author s understanding of nearby and vanishing cycles as presented below ; and to mark de cataldo , for his generous contribution of time and effort to the improvement of these notes .    in order to maintain readability </S>",
    "<S> , we will work with sheaves of vector spaces in the classical topology on complex algebraic varieties , except in the second part of [ sec : comments ] , where we will require the field of coefficients to be algebraically closed . </S>",
    "<S> for the necessary modifications to tale sheaves , one should consult beilinson s paper : aside from the shift in definitions the only change is some tate twists . for the d - modules case , one should read sam lichtenstein s undergraduate thesis , @xcite , in which the two - sided limit construction is also given in detail . </S>"
