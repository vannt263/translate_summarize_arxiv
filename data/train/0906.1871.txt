    "compounds with crystal structures featuring a rigid covalently bonded framework enclosing differently bonded guest atoms attracted much attention in the last decade .",
    "in particular the skutterudite and clathrate families have been investigated in depth , and a fascinating diversity of physical phenomena is observed , many of which are due to subtle host - guest interactions . among the skutterudites they range from magnetic ordering to heavy - fermion and non - fermi liquids , superconductivity , itinerant ferromagnetism , half - metallicity , and good thermoelectric properties .",
    "@xcite superconductivity of conventional @xcite and heavy - fermion type is found in skutterudites with @xmath5 s up to 17k .",

    "the compounds with the divalent cations sr and ba have lower @xmath11 s around 5.0k.@xcite    band structure calculations predict that the electronic density of states ( dos ) close to the fermi level @xmath12 is determined by ge-@xmath13 states in all @xmath4pt@xmath0ge@xmath1 materials.@xcite the position of @xmath12 is adjusted by the electron count on the polyanionic host structure .",
    "this leads to the situation that the band structure at @xmath12 can be shifted in an almost rigid - band manner by `` doping '' of the polyanion , which can be achieved either by charge transfer from the guest @xmath4 or by internal substitution of the transition metal @xmath8 .",
    "recently , this principle was demonstrated on the pt - by - au substitution in bapt@xmath14au@xmath15ge@xmath1 : while bapt@xmath0ge@xmath1 has a calculated dos of 8.8states/(ev f.u . ) , at the composition bapt@xmath6auge@xmath1 the dos is enhanced to 11.5states/(ev f.u.).@xcite experimentally , an increase of the superconducting @xmath11 from 5.0k to 7.0k.@xcite was observed .",
    "the rigid - band shift of the dos peak at @xmath12 with gold substitution is due to the pt(au ) @xmath3 electrons which , according to band structure calculations , lie rather deep below @xmath12 and provide only a minor contribution to the dos at @xmath12.@xcite    another prediction from the band structure calculations concerns the special role played by the pt @xmath3 states in srpt@xmath0ge@xmath1 for the chemical bonding .",

    "figure  [ theo_dos ] shows the calculated dos for srpt@xmath0ge@xmath1 ( @xmath12 is at zero binding energy ) .",
    "the valence band is almost exclusively formed by pt and ge states .",
    "the low and featureless sr dos indicates that it plays basically the role of a charge reservoir .",
    "further inspection of the dos shows that the high - lying states between about 6 and 12 ev binding energies originate predominantly from ge 4@xmath17 electrons , whereas the lower lying part of the valence band is formed by pt 5@xmath19 and ge 4@xmath2 states .",

    "the spectra are normalized to their integrated intensities , after an integral background has been subtracted to account for inelastic scattering .",
    "all spectra show a clear cut - off at @xmath12 ( zero binding energy ) consistent with the systems being good metals .",
    "it is of no surprise that the 700 ev spectrum of srpt@xmath0ge@xmath1 is very much different from that of pt since they are different materials .",
    "more interesting is that there are also differences between the 700 ev and 190 ev spectra of srpt@xmath0ge@xmath1 itself .",
    "this is caused by differences in the photon energy dependence of the photo - ionization cross - section of the relevant subshells forming the valence band , in this case , the ge @xmath30 , @xmath13 , and pt @xmath3.@xcite in fact , we chose those 190 ev and 700 ev photon energies in order to make optimal use of the cross - section effects for identifying the individual contributions of the ge and pt states to the valence band as we will show in the next sections .",
    "in particular , at 700 ev the pt @xmath3 cross - section is calculated to be a factor 3.9 larger than that of the ge 4p , while at 190 ev ( close to the cooper minimum for the pt @xmath3 ) it is equal or even slightly smaller , i.e. a factor 0.92 , see table  [ tabcross ] . in other words ,",
    "the 700 ev spectra is dominated by the pt @xmath3 contribution while at 190 ev the contributions become comparable .",
    "the intensity @xmath32 of a normalized spectrum as depicted in figure  [ exp_xps ] is built up from the pt @xmath3 , ge @xmath13 and ge @xmath30 partial dos ( @xmath33 ) , weighted with their respective photo - ionization cross - sections ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "this is formulated in equations 1 and 2 which take into account that the cross - sections at 190 ev photon energy are different from those at 700 ev , respectively .",
    "the proportionality factors @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , also enter here since the absolute values for the photon flux and the transmission efficiency of the electron energy analyzer are not known .",
    "in addition , the constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are introduced to express the non - uniqueness in the calculation of the weight of the pt @xmath3 , ge @xmath13 , and ge @xmath30 dos , respectively , since these depend ( somewhat ) on which calculational method has been used .",

    ", i.e. most relevant for the properties , the valence band seems to be determined mostly by the pt @xmath3 and ge @xmath13 states .",
    "we now analyze the experimental spectra along these lines . using equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 )",
    ", we can experimentally extract the pt @xmath3 and ge @xmath13 dos as follows :      with @xmath41 = ( @xmath42)@xmath18(@xmath43 ) and @xmath44 = ( @xmath45)@xmath18(@xmath46 ) . while the cross - sections @xmath31 can be readily obtained from table  [ tabcross ] , it would be an enormous task to determine ( experimentally ) the ratio between @xmath35 and @xmath34 . thus , since it is difficult to obtain directly an estimate for @xmath41 and @xmath44 , we use the product @xmath47 given by ( @xmath48)/(@xmath49 ) , which can be calculated from table  [ tabcross ] to be about 0.92/3.9 = 0.24 . therefore , we vary the values for a and b under the constraint that @xmath47=0.24 , searching for difference spectra which reproduce both the pt @xmath3 and the ge @xmath13 dos as obtained by the band structure calculations .",

    "focusing first at figure  [ diff700 ] in which the rescaled 190 ev spectrum is subtracted from the 700 ev one , we can observe that the difference spectrum resembles very much that of the calculated pt @xmath3 dos .",
    "here the latter has been broadened to account for the experimental resolution and lifetime effects .",
    "interestingly , the main pt intensity is positioned at around 3 - 6 ev binding energies and its weight near the @xmath12 region is very small .",
    "the experiment fully confirms this particular aspect of the theoretical prediction , which is important for the modeling of the superconducting properties as discussed above .",
    "we would like to note that the main peak of the calculated pt @xmath3 dos is positioned at a somewhat lower binding energy than that of the experimental difference spectrum .",
    "similar small deviations have been observed in other intermetallic materials@xcite and can be attributed to the inherent limitations of mean - field methods like the lda to calculate the dynamic response of a system .",
    "figure  [ diff190 ] shows the difference of the spectrum taken at 190 ev and the rescaled spectrum at 700 ev .",
    "this experimental difference spectrum reveals structures which can be divided into two major energy regions : the first region extends from 0 to 6 ev binding energy , and the second from 6 to 12 ev .",
    "for the first region we can make a comparison with the calculated ge @xmath13 dos , since the calculated ge @xmath30 contribution is negligible as explained above . we obtain a very satisfying agreement between the experiment and theory for the ge @xmath13 states .",
    "in particular , we would like to point out that the experiment confirms the strong presence the ge @xmath13 states in the vicinity of the fermi level @xmath12 .",
    "looking now at the second region , we see that the calculated ge @xmath30 also reproduces nicely the experimental difference spectrum . here",
    "we remark that the calculated ge @xmath13 has a negligible contribution in this region .      as a further check",
    "we also perform a comparison between the experimental photoemission spectrum of elemental pt metal and the corresponding calculated pt @xmath3 dos .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ ptmetal ] . also here",
    "we find satisfying agreement between experiment and theory .",
    "the pt @xmath3 states range from 9 ev binding energy all the way up to @xmath12 .",
    "clearly , the high fermi cut - off in pt metal is formed by these pt @xmath3 states , in strong contrast to the srpt@xmath51ge@xmath1 case .",
    "core level photoemission spectra of srpt@xmath0ge@xmath1 ( top ) and elemental pt metal ( bottom ) .",
    "solid vertical lines represent the peak positions of the @xmath52 levels , dashed vertical lines the center of gravity positions ( see text).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    figure [ corelevels4f ] shows the pt 4@xmath53 core levels of srpt@xmath0ge@xmath1 ( top ) and elemental pt metal ( bottom ) .",
    "the spectra exhibit the characteristic spin - orbit splitting giving the 4@xmath54 and 4@xmath23 peaks . for srpt@xmath0ge@xmath1 , the peak positions for the 4@xmath54 and 4@xmath23 are 75.4 and 72.1 ev binding energy , respectively",
    ". for pt metal , the values are 74.4 and 71.1 ev , respectively .",
    "the spin orbit splitting is thus 3.3 ev for both materials .",
    "this compares well with the calculated spin - orbit splitting of about 3.45 ev for both compounds from the lda calculations .",
    "remarkable is that the srpt@xmath0ge@xmath1 4@xmath53 peaks are shifted by 1 ev to higher binding energies in comparison to those of pt metal .",
    "similar shifts have also been observed in other noble metal intermetallic compounds,@xcite indicating a more dilute electron density around the noble metal sites . to compare this chemical shift to lda calculations , one has to take into account that lda does not incorporate many body effects of the final state , manifesting in the asymmetric line shape of the spectra as we will discuss below in more detail .",
    "but it can be shown @xcite that final state effects do not alter the average energy of the spectrum .",
    "if we determine the center of gravity of the 4@xmath23 , we find a binding energy of 72.4 ev for srpt@xmath0ge@xmath1 and 71.9@xmath550.2ev ( indicated by dashed lines in figure [ corelevels4f ] ) for pt metal , resulting in a chemical shift of 0.4ev to 0.6ev .",
    "this agrees well with the shift obtained from our band structure calculations which amounts to 0.43 ev .",
    "one can clearly observe that the line shape of the core levels in srpt@xmath0ge@xmath1 is narrower and not as asymmetric as in the case of pt metal .",
    "an asymmetry in the line shape is caused by the presence of electron - hole pair excitations upon the creation of the core hole , i.e. screening of the core hole by conduction band electrons , and can be well understood in terms of the doniac - sunjic theory.@xcite the strong asymmetry of the 4@xmath53 of pt metal can therefore be taken as an indication for the high dos with pt character at @xmath12.@xcite the rather symmetric line shape of the 4@xmath53 of srpt@xmath0ge@xmath1 , on the other hand , indicates very low dos at @xmath12 .",
    "all this confirms the results of the valence band measurements : the main intensity of the pt 5@xmath19 band is at 3 - 6 ev binding energies , strongly reducing its weight at @xmath12 .    in conclusion",
    ", we find excellent agreement between the measured photoemission spectra and the lda band structure calculations for srpt@xmath0ge@xmath1 .",
    "this confirms the picture of the chemical bonding analysis yielding rather deep lying pt 5@xmath19 states which only partially form covalent bands with the ge 4@xmath2 electrons . in turn , the states at the fermi level that are relevant for the superconducting behavior of this compound can be firmly assigned to ge 4@xmath2 electrons .",
    "this study provides strong support that band theory is a good starting point for the understanding of the electronic structure of the @xmath4pt@xmath0ge@xmath1 ( @xmath4 = sr , ba , la , pr , th ) material class , and is thus of valuable help in the search for new compositions with higher superconducting transition temperatures ."
