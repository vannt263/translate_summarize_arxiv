    "quantum key distribution can enable two authentic parties , the sender ( alice ) and the receiver ( bob ) , to obtain unconditional secret keys without restricting the power of the eavesdropper ( eve ) @xcite .",
    "on the premise of unconditional security , the higher key rate and the longer distance are constantly pursued @xcite . to enhance the tolerable excess noise of the continuous - variable quantum key distribution ( cv qkd ) @xcite ,",
    "the two - way cv qkd protocols are proposed @xcite , where bob initially sends a mode to alice , and alice encodes her information by applying a random displacement operator to the received mode and then sends it back to bob .",
    "bob detects both his original mode and received mode to decode alice s modulations .",
    "although the two - way cv qkd protocols can remarkably enhance the tolerable excess noise @xcite , it needs to implement the tomography of the quantum channels to analyze the security under general collective attack @xcite , which is complicated in practice .",
    "therefore , we proposed a feasible modified two - way protocol by replacing the displacement operation of the original two - way protocol with a passive operation on alice s side @xcite .",
    "however , the source noise @xcite and both detection efficiency and detection noise @xcite on bob s side are not considered in the modified protocol .",
    "it has been proved that adding a proper noise on bob s detection side in one - way cv qkd can enhance the tolerable excess noise and the secret key rate in reverse reconciliation @xcite .",
    "this idea has been applied to the original two - way protocol in @xcite , while the scheme did not consider the correlation between the two channels .",
    "the correlated noise affects the secret key rate @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "we apply the idea of adding noise to our modified two - way protocol @xmath1 @xcite to enhance the tolerable excess noise and the secret key rate . considering the correlation between the channels ,",
    "the security of the two - way cv qkd with added noise against entangling cloner collective attacks @xcite is analysed and numerically simulated .",
    "the entanglement - based ( eb ) scheme of the two - way cv - qkd protocol @xmath2 with added detection noise is shown in ( a ) , where the dashed box at @xmath3 is the added noise and the other part is our original two - way protocol @xmath1 @xcite . the added noise is equivalent to an einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pair with the variance of @xmath4 coupled into the channel by a beam splitter with the transmittance of @xmath5 . the protocol @xmath2 is described as follows .",
    "_ step one_. bob initially keeps one mode @xmath6 of an epr pair with the variance of @xmath7 while sending the other mode @xmath8 to alice through the forward channel .    _",
    "step two_. alice measures one mode @xmath9 of her epr pair ( variance : @xmath10 ) to get the variables \\{@xmath11 , @xmath12 } with a heterodyne detection , and couples the other mode of her epr pair with the received mode @xmath13 from bob by a beam splitter ( transmittance : @xmath14 ) .",
    "one output mode @xmath15 of the beam splitter is measured with homodyne detection and the other output mode @xmath16 is sent back to bob through the backward channel .    _",
    "step three_. with a beam splitter ( transmittance : @xmath5 ) , bob couples another epr pair ( variance : @xmath4 ) which is equivalent to the added noise with his received mode .",
    "the two modes @xmath17 and @xmath18 of this epr pair are measured .",
    "bob performs homodyne detections on both modes @xmath6 and @xmath3 to get the variables @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 ) , respectively .",
    "_ step four_. alice and bob implement the reconciliation and privacy amplification @xcite . in this step ,",
    "the measurement values of the modes @xmath3 , @xmath6 , @xmath15 , @xmath9 , @xmath18 and @xmath17 are used to estimate the channel s parameters and bob uses @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) to construct the optimal estimation to alice s corresponding variables @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , where @xmath25 is the channel s total transmittance .",
    "the prepare - and - measure ( pm ) scheme of the two - way protocol can be equivalent to the eb scheme .",
    "in fact , alice heterodyning one half of the epr pair at @xmath9 is equivalent to remotely preparing a coherent state , and bob performing homodyne detection on one half of the epr pair at @xmath6 is equivalent to remotely preparing a squeezed state @xcite .",
    "the homodyne detection preceded by an epr pair coupled by a beam splitter at @xmath3 is equivalent to bob s real homodyne detection with efficiency @xmath5 and electronic noise @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath26 and @xmath27 quadratures are randomly measured in homodyne detection and only @xmath26 quadrature is analysed in the following .",
    "( a ) the eb scheme of @xmath28 protocol .",
    "bob keeps one half of the epr pair ( epr ) and sends the other half to alice .",
    "alice measures one mode of her epr pair ( @xmath29 ) and one mode @xmath15 from a beam splitter @xmath14 .",
    "the other mode from this beam splitter is returned back to bob .",
    "the letters ( e.g. @xmath30 ) beside arrows : the mode at the arrow ; e : eve s whole mode ; the dashed box at @xmath9 : the heterodyne detection ; the dashed box at @xmath3 : the added noise . ( b ) the equivalent scheme to ( a ) with postprocessing . bob uses a symplectic transformation @xmath31 to change the modes @xmath3 and @xmath6 into @xmath32 and @xmath33.,width=396 ]",
    "first , we show that the gaussian attack is optimal to the two - way protocol @xmath28 in general collective attack . in ( a ) ,",
    "since all modes of alice and bob are measured , eve can get the purification of the state of alice and bob .",
    "in addition , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 quadratures of alice and bob s modes are not mixed via heterodyne or homodyne detection and alice and bob use the second - order moments of the quadratures to bound eve s information .",
    "therefore , the two - way protocol @xmath28 can satisfy the requirement of optimality of gaussian collective attack ( i.e. , continuity , invariance under local gaussian unitary and strong subadditivity ) @xcite . when the corresponding covariance matrix of the state @xmath34 is known for alice and bob",
    ", the gaussian attack is optimal @xcite .",
    "therefore , only eve s gaussian collective attack is needed to be considered in the following security analysis .    in ( a ) , the secret key rate of the two - way protocol @xmath28 in reverse reconciliation is @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the reconciliation efficiency , @xmath37 [ @xmath38 is the mutual information between bob and alice ( eve ) , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are alice s variance and conditional variance , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are eve s von neumann entropy and conditional von neumann entropy on bob s data , respectively . in the following , @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "are calculated by the methods in @xcite .    for gaussian state , the entropy can be calculated from its corresponding covariance matrix @xcite . since the state @xmath43 is a pure state , then @xmath44 .",

    "after the symplectic transformation @xmath31 , the corresponding covariance matrix of the mode @xmath57 is @xmath58\\gamma_{b_2b_1n_2n_1a_2a_1}[\\gamma_k\\oplus\\mathbb{i}_4]^t,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 , @xmath60 is a continuous - variable c - not gate @xcite @xmath61 since the state @xmath62 is a pure state when bob gets @xmath63 by measuring the modes @xmath33 , then @xmath64 .",

    "therefore , we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the symplectic eigenvalue of @xmath75 which is the function of the element @xmath76 of @xmath75 @xcite , seen in [ appendixa ] .",
