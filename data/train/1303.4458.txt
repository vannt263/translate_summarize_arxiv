    "in many applications , one wishes to reconstruct a signal from the magnitudes of its fourier coefficients .",
    "this problem is known as _ phase retrieval _ , and it has been instrumental to many important scientific advances , including the nobel prize  winning work that leveraged x - ray diffraction to establish the double helix structure of dna  @xcite . of course , given only the magnitudes of a signal s fourier coefficients , one does not have enough information to recover the signal  while the fourier transform is injective , the point - wise absolute value is not . as such , one is inclined to use a priori knowledge of the signal , and hope it is then uniquely determined by the fourier magnitudes . for example , to deduce the structure of dna , watson and crick  @xcite applied certain chemical assumptions , along with a knowledge of van der waals interactions between atoms .    in order to image more exotic molecules , such assumptions are difficult to apply , and so there has been quite a bit of work attempting to exploit more general assumptions ( e.g. , positivity or support constraints ) . to account for this sort of prior information ,",
    "the most popular phase retrieval algorithms are modifications of gerchberg and saxton s original approach  @xcite , which alternates between the time and frequency domains , iteratively correcting the current guess by imposing time - domain assumptions or scaling fourier coefficients to match the measured data .",
    "marchesini  @xcite surveys and compares the various modifications , but they all have a tendency to stall in local minima .    to address this issue ,",
    "cands , eldar , strohmer and voroninski  @xcite proposed an alternative methodology whereby nonuniqueness is overcome not by prior information , but by additional illuminations . for each illumination ,",
    "a different mask ( or grating ) is used to distort the appearance of the object in question ; in mathematical parlance , each mask acts as a multiplication operator on the desired signal before the fourier transform .",
    "furthermore , cands et al .  constructed three masks such that the corresponding illuminations uniquely determine almost every signal up to a global phase factor ; a fourth illumination is necessary to uniquely determine all signals  @xcite .",
    "however , the phase retrieval algorithms they propose are not guaranteed to reconstruct the desired signal from these three illuminations , even if the signal is uniquely determined by the illuminations .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) defined by @xmath1 in this paper , we follow the lead of  @xcite to find masks @xmath2",
    "( i.e. , multiplication operators on @xmath3 ) such that every signal @xmath4 can be efficiently reconstructed , up to a global phase factor , from measurements of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the complex sinusoid @xmath7 .",
    "specifically , we will design the masks in such a way that allows for a new reconstruction technique to work , namely the polarization - based technique introduced in  @xcite . as established in  @xcite , every signal @xmath8 can be stably reconstructed from @xmath9 if the measurement vectors @xmath10 are constructed using a particular random process . in this paper , we show how to fulfill the design criteria that measurement vectors be of the form @xmath11 while still allowing for polarization - based reconstruction . if anything",
    ", this demonstrates that polarization is flexible enough to provably accommodate certain measurement design requirements , which are bound to arise from various applications .    in the next section",
    ", we briefly review the main ideas behind the polarization - based technique , and we show how to apply them with fourier masks . in particular , we reduce the problem of building masks to a problem in additive combinatorics : find a small subset of @xmath12 with small fourier bias . in section  3 ,",
    "we use concentration - of - measure arguments to solve this problem , culminating in the construction of @xmath13 masks that uniquely determine every signal in @xmath14 up to a global phase factor .",
    "next in section  4 , we compare the performance of polarization to a state - of - the - art phase retrieval algorithm known as phaselift  @xcite . here",
    ", we show that polarization provides a comparable amount of stability with fourier masks , while being orders of magnitude faster .",
    "we conclude in section  5 with some remarks .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is that the ideas in  @xcite can be leveraged to uniquely measure signals with masked fourier transforms . in this section , we summarize these ideas and explain how we apply them . in  @xcite ,",
    "the signal @xmath8 is measured with two ensembles of vectors @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 has the property that every subcollection of size @xmath17 spans @xmath14 ; such ensembles are called _ full spark frames _ , of which there are several known constructions  @xcite . to determine @xmath18 ,",
    "first define a graph @xmath19 whose vertices @xmath20 index the measurement vectors @xmath21 .",
    "then each edge @xmath22 corresponds to three members of @xmath18 , namely @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "these edges are useful because they determine the relative phase between the inner products @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "specifically , a version of the polarization identity gives that @xmath27 and so the relative phase is calculated by normalizing this quantity ( provided it s nonzero ) . on the other hand , if an inner product @xmath25 is zero , then for every vertex @xmath28 adjacent to @xmath29 in @xmath30 , the members of @xmath18 corresponding to @xmath31 are useless , since the relative phases they are intended to capture are not well defined . indeed ,",
    "@xmath8 being orthogonal to @xmath10 has the effect of deleting the vertex @xmath29 ( and its edges ) from the graph @xmath30 .",
    "however , since @xmath16 is full spark , @xmath8 is orthogonal to at most @xmath32 vertex vectors , thereby limiting the damage to our graph .",
    "furthermore , for any remaining connected component @xmath33 of size @xmath34 , we can propagate the relative phases to determine @xmath35 up to a global phase factor , and since @xmath36 necessarily span @xmath14 , we can determine @xmath8 from @xmath35 by least - squares estimation .",
    "interestingly , there will always be a connected component of size @xmath34 after the removal of any @xmath32 vertices , provided the graph @xmath30 is regular with a sufficiently large _",
    "spectral gap_. to be clear , the spectral gap of a @xmath37-regular graph @xmath30 is determined by the eigenvalues @xmath38 of its adjacency matrix : @xmath39 and the existence of the requisite connected component is given by the following classical result in spectral graph theory ( e.g. , see lemma  5.2 of  @xcite ) :    [ lemma.spectral gap vs connectivity ] consider a @xmath37-regular graph @xmath30 of @xmath40 vertices . for all @xmath41 , removing any @xmath42 edges from @xmath30 results in a connected component of size @xmath43 .    in summary , in order to apply the polarization trick in the setting of masked dfts , it suffices to ( i ) construct a full spark ensemble @xmath16 with masked dfts , and ( ii ) construct a graph @xmath30 with a sufficiently large spectral gap and whose corresponding edge vectors @xmath18 can also be implemented with masked dfts .",
    "we quickly address ( i ) with the following result :    [ lemma.full spark phi_v ] for each @xmath44 , pick some nonzero @xmath45 and define @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the complex sinusoid @xmath7 then @xmath47 is full spark if and only if @xmath48 is not an @xmath49th root of unity for any pair of distinct @xmath50 .    the @xmath51 matrix whose columns are @xmath11 has vandermonde form , as does each of its @xmath52 submatrices .",
    "these submatrices are all invertible precisely when their determinants are nonzero , that is , when @xmath53 are distinct ( by the vandermonde determinant formula ) . the lemma immediately follows .",
    "the condition above is satisfied with probability @xmath54 if the @xmath55 s are drawn uniformly at random from the complex unit circle . for a deterministic alternative",
    ", it suffices to take @xmath56 .",
    "now that we have established how to construct masks @xmath57 such that @xmath58 is full spark , we turn to solving ( ii ) . before describing our construction of @xmath30 ,",
    "we first motivate it by illustrating how polarized combinations of our vertex vectors can be expressed using masked dfts :    [ lemma.modulation trick ] take @xmath24 , let @xmath59 denote the modulation operator , and consider @xmath58 , as defined in lemma  [ lemma.full spark phi_v ] .",
    "then @xmath60 for all @xmath50 and @xmath61 .",
    "consider the @xmath62th entry of @xmath63 : @xmath64 then @xmath65 .",
    "when implementing the modulation trick of lemma  [ lemma.modulation trick ] using dfts , we will have to fix @xmath66 ( so as to apply a fixed mask ) and let @xmath49 vary ( since we will mask an entire dft ) .",
    "as such , we intend to use auxiliary masks of the form @xmath67 , thereby drawing an edge between every @xmath68 and @xmath69 such that @xmath70 .",
    "this informs our decision of how to construct the graph @xmath30 , since it enables a masked - dft implementation :    [ definition.graph construction ] we construct @xmath30 as follows : pick @xmath71 such that @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    ". then @xmath68 and @xmath69 are adjacent precisely when @xmath74 .",
    "note that for each @xmath75 , the corresponding edges between @xmath76 and @xmath77 are implemented with the masks @xmath67 . as such",
    ", @xmath78 is the set of modulations used to combine the @xmath79 original masks @xmath57 into @xmath80 auxiliary masks .",
    "also note that @xmath30 has no loops since @xmath72 , @xmath30 is not directed since @xmath73 , and furthermore every vertex has degree @xmath81 , so @xmath30 is regular .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath30 has a sufficiently large spectral gap . to simplify this analysis",
    ", we first relate the spectral gap to a fundamental concept in additive combinatorics called the _",
    "fourier bias_. as in  @xcite , take @xmath71 and let @xmath82 denote the characteristic function of @xmath78 .",
    "then the fourier bias of @xmath78 is defined as follows : @xmath83 fourier bias is used in additive combinatorics to measure pseudorandomness ; here , the main idea is that correlation with any complex sinusoid indicates regularity , which is not typically exhibited by random sets . as indicated earlier , the spectral gap of @xmath30 is intimately related to the fourier bias of @xmath78 :    [ lemma.spectral gap vs fourier bias ] consider the graph @xmath30 defined in definition  [ definition.graph construction ] .",
    "the spectral gap of @xmath30 is @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes fourier bias .    to determine the spectral gap",
    ", we first determine the adjacency matrix @xmath86 of @xmath30 . for any pair @xmath50 ,",
    "the adjacency rule for @xmath68 and @xmath69 is whether @xmath74 . as such",
    ", the @xmath87th block of @xmath86 is circulant , with each row being a translation of @xmath82 .",
    "this gives the expression @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the @xmath90 all - ones matrix and @xmath91 denotes the kronecker product .",
    "one useful property of the kronecker product is that its eigenvalues are products of eigenvalues : @xmath92 here , we note that the only nontrivial eigenvalue of @xmath89 is @xmath79 , and the eigenvalues of @xmath93 are the entries of the fourier transform @xmath94 . as such , the nontrivial eigenvalues of @xmath86 are given by @xmath95 by the triangle inequality , we then have @xmath96 with equality when @xmath97 .",
    "this means the largest eigenvalue of @xmath86 is @xmath98 , which corresponds to the all - ones eigenvector , and so the spectral gap of @xmath30 is @xmath99 as claimed .    at this point , we have reduced the problem of finding injective fourier masks to finding a small set @xmath71 of sufficiently small fourier bias ( i.e. , a problem in additive combinatorics ) . in the next section , we use the following random process to construct this set : draw @xmath100 at random and take @xmath101 . with the appropriate choice of distribution , we construct @xmath78 of size @xmath102 and fourier bias @xmath103 , thereby producing a graph @xmath30 with a spectral gap that is bounded away from zero ( see theorem  [ theorem.bound on spectral gap ] ) .",
    "we also show that the spectral gap is bounded away from zero only if @xmath78 has size @xmath104 , thereby demonstrating the optimality of our analysis ( see theorem  [ theorem.log is necessary ] ) .",

    ", perhaps the most striking distinction between polarization and phaselift is the relative error ; indeed , polarization produces an estimate with almost no error ( @xmath260 ) , whereas phaselift produces noticeable error ( @xmath261 ) .",
    "in addition , polarization beats phaselift when using the same number of masks . for higher dimension signals",
    ", this advantage translates to minutes versus hours of running time . letting @xmath262 denote",
    "the number of intensity measurements , then phaselift takes @xmath263 operations , whereas the computational bottleneck in polarization is the least - squares step , which takes @xmath264 operations , but this does not account for the disparity in run time .",
    "rather , the disparity is indicative of a large constant in front of the @xmath265 . in comparing the relative error in reconstruction",
    ", we note that phaselift terminates when the step size is sufficiently small , so this accounts for the significant difference in performance .",
    "overall , in the noiseless case , polarization handily defeats phaselift , even when phaselift is given the random masks it prefers .",
    "next , figure  [ figure.noise01 ] illustrates how polarization and phaselift perform in the present of some noise ( @xmath266 ) . in this case",
    ", phaselift continues to be rather slow , and it is clear that polarization enjoys greater stability from the @xmath250 additional masks when compared to phaselift s performance with just the original @xmath249 random masks . in  @xcite , it is claimed that @xmath249 random masks are sufficient for phaselift to reconstruct typical signals ( and this is corroborated with our experiments in the noiseless case ) , but figure  [ figure.noise01 ] illustrates that phaselift requires more masks in order to reconstruct stably . and indeed , when phaselift is given more masks , it performs much better .",
    "specifically , when they use the same masks , polarization and phaselift produce estimates with statistically comparable relative error , and phaselift performs slightly better when given the random masks it prefers .",
    "intuitively , it makes sense that phaselift should be at least slightly more stable than polarization since it leverages all of the measurements in a democratic fashion , whereas polarization disenfranchises the vertex and edge measurements that are too small ( i.e. , `` wasting '' measurements ) .    figure  [ figure.noise10 ] presents the results of our high - noise scenario ( @xmath267 ) , which are very similar to the results corresponding to @xmath266 .",
    "in this paper , we showed how to leverage the polarization - based phase retrieval technique to construct @xmath102 fourier masks that uniquely determine every @xmath17-dimensional signal , and then we used numerical simulations to illustrate the stability of polarization with such masks . at this point , we offer two conclusions :    * the polarization technique for phase retrieval is flexible enough to provably accommodate certain measurement design criteria ( such as fourier masks ) . *",
    "if you have the ability to use polarization instead of phaselift , you will gain considerable speedups in run time at the price of a slight increase in relative error .",
    "it remains to be rigorously proved that stability holds in the fourier masks setting .",
    "we did not exploit the inherent fourier structure to further speed up reconstruction , though this could very well be possible .",
    "the number of masks might be decreased if additional information about the signal were leveraged , as in  @xcite .",
