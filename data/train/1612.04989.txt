    "two - dimensional electron gas formed on reconstructed semiconductor surfaces where coulomb interaction energy is comparable with charge carrier kinetic energy is very promising systems for experimental study the effect of electron - electron interactions on the ground state and temperature - dependent transport properties . of great interest for the study are @xmath4-phase surfaces obtained by covering an ideal ( 111 ) si or ge surface with the 1/3 ml of group i , iv adatoms forming a @xmath5 reconstruction with @xmath6     inter - adatom distance .",
    "these systems have a very narrow half - filled surface state band , with an odd number of electrons per unit cell , which is metallic but affected by various scenarios of structural and electronic instabilities at low temperatures : charge - density wave - like reversible @xmath7 periodic surface structure distortion in pb / ge(111 ) and sn / ge(111 ) @xcite ; undistorted @xmath8 mott - hubbard insulator ( mi ) state in si / sic(0001)@xcite and k : si(111)@xmath9-b @xcite .",
    "an intermediate case is the si(111)-@xmath10-sn surface . for this structure",
    "a density functional calculation in the local density approximation ( lda ) predicts an undistorted ground metal state @xcite .",
    "the experimental study of the electronic surface structure by photoemission shows a metallic band structure as expected from the simple electron counting but with clear indication of @xmath11 periodicity @xcite .",
    "structural tools like stm and photoelectron diffraction showing only @xmath12 periodicity provide no fingerprints of the @xmath11 structure @xcite .",
    "more recent local spin density ( lsda ) + hubbard u approximation @xcite predicts a stable magnetic ( mott - hubbard - like ) insulating @xmath8 phase in sn / si(111 ) which forms two separate @xmath13 unit cells where one is fully ferromagnetic and the other ferrimagnetic ( two atoms spins up and one spin down ) .",
    "the calculation explains the fingerprints in photoemision intensity near @xmath14 at @xmath15 observed in sn / si(111 ) @xcite due to @xmath11 anti - ferromagnetic order .",
    "a scanning tunnelling spectroscopy ( sts ) demonstrated an insulating gap in the local density of states ( ldos ) at the fermi level @xcite with a narrow band gap ( @xmath16 mev ) , which disappears above 70k but the deep minima in ldos still exists up to the room temperature .",
    "the answer on possible mi transition could be obtained from electronic transport measurements .",
    "temperature dependence of conductivity of the sn / si(111)@xmath8 surface shows an insulator behaviour in a wide temperature range 20300  k with possible variable - range hopping transport mechanism due to the defects or activation behaviour with very small activation energy @xmath17 mev , which was not uniquely determined @xcite .",
    "similar behaviour and discrepancy in various experimental results was observed in metallic si(111)@xmath18 surface @xcite .",
    "the recent explanation @xcite considers the narrow band gap observed in the surface states at the fermi level as a result of the dynamic coulomb blocade which appears due to sts on surfaces with the sheet conductivity much less than the minimum metallic conductivity @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the deep band gap at ldos in sn / si(111)@xmath8 surface behaves very similar to the dynamic coulomb gap in si(111)-@xmath20 and may follow the same scenario .    here",
    "we report the results of detailed study of si(111)-(@xmath21-sn surface .",
    "we show by comparing the temperature dependence of ldos measured by tunnelling spectroscopy with temperature dependence of the surface conductivity , that the surface ground state corresponds to insulator - like state with the surface band gap @xmath1 mev , in accordance with lsda+u calculation @xcite .",
    "with increasing the temperature the mi spin - ordered state vanishes due to thermal fluctuation and the surface turns into a bad metal .",
    "the transport measurements indicate the efros - shlklovskii hoping regime with the charge carrier localization length @xmath22    , right to the interatomic distance of si(111)-(@xmath21-sn unit cell , and the energy gap in tunnelling spectroscopy at higher temperatures is well described with temperature dependent dynamic coulomb gap approximation @xcite .",
    "the tunnelling spectroscopy measurements were performed in commercial uhv lt stm omicron .",
    "we used low doped _ n- _ and _ p_-type si crystals with @xmath23  @xmath24 cm as the substrate in order to eliminate the contribution of the bulk conductivity at low temperatures in electron transport measurements and the effect of charge carrier concentration change due to the band bending near the surface @xcite .",
    "such crystals are insulating in the low - temperature region and can not be studied by the stm technique .",
    "therefore , for sts study we used the external illumination to produce necessary bulk conduction at low temperatures ( see details below ) .",
    "the si(111)-@xmath18 clean surface was prepared by direct current heating up to @xmath25c for 30 s and computer controlled cooling .",
    "then the 1/3 ml of sn was deposited at rt on the surface and annealed at @xmath26c for 5 min to create the si(111)-(@xmath8)-sn reconstructions . to eliminate the ( @xmath27)-sn phase growth near the step edges ( fig .",
    "[ stm_images]a ) the necessary quantity of deposited sn was fitted by reducing the evaporation time until the @xmath28 - sn phase disappears completely .",
    "all stm and sts measurements were performed with platinum stm tips , preliminary tested on au foil to verify spectroscopy and microscopy capability .",
    "i - v _ curves were collected at fixed temperature over the adatom of the si(111)-(@xmath8)-sn unit cell far away from defects and averaged over series of measurements consisting of tens individual cycles .",
    "the data collected over the individual defects are the same .",
    "the _ di / dv _ were measured with lock - in technique with a sinusoidal modulation of the sample bias voltage with amplitude 30 - 50 mv at frequency _ f _ = 778 hz , and verified by comparison with calculated numerically _ di / dv _ from averaged _ i - v _ curves .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the measured value of the energy gap in ldos for the si(111)-@xmath8-sn surface at helium temperature is @xmath29mev and agrees well to the activation energy obtained in the transport measurements @xmath30  mev .",
    "so the ground state corresponds to the calculated spin - order magnetic mott - hubbard insulator state @xcite . with temperature increase",
    "the spin ordering should disappear due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the intersite antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange coupling energy is @xmath31  mev @xcite , so vanishing of af state at @xmath32  k is expected .",
    "the next phase for si(111)-(@xmath8)-sn surface is pseudo - gap metal .",
    "the conductivity is expected to be the variable - range hopping conduction affected by strong coulomb interaction .",
    "indeed , our data indicates the efros - shklovskii temperature dependent conductivity @xmath33 above @xmath2  k ( fig .",
    "[ efsh]a ) with estimated @xmath34  ev in good agreement with our suggestion .",
    "this corresponds to the localization length of the charge carrier @xmath35  nm @xcite , where @xmath36 dielectric constant of the si bulk plus vacuum .",
    "the localization length precisely matches the distance between sn atoms in unit cell , which is very similar to what was observed in si(111)-@xmath18 surface @xcite .    with increasing the temperature the deep valley at zero bias in tunnelling ldos",
    "is not connected any more to the band gap of the mi ground state , but could be described in terms of dynamic coulomb blockade approximation as a sequential single electron tunnelling into a low conductive surface with sheet conduction @xmath37 . in this approximation",
    "the surface is presented as the resistance @xmath38 and the capacitance @xmath39 ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "the sts data at @xmath40  k fitted within dynamic coulomb approximation using the only one fitting parameter @xmath39 is presented in fig.[efsh]b . for higher temperatures the data also fits well within @xmath41  f.",
    "the relevant localization length @xmath42 of the tunnelled electron could be estimated as @xmath43  nm @xcite .",
    "the value agrees perfectly with the localization length obtained from the transport measurements .",
    "in conclusion , through analysis of transport conductance measurements and tunnelling spectroscopy data of the si(111)-@xmath0-sn surface formed on low doped si samples , we found that the ground state of this surface corresponds to the mott - hubbard insulator as was proposed before , with the surface band gap @xmath1 mev .",
    "with increasing the temperature the magnetic insulator state vanishes due to thermal fluctuation and the surface turns into `` bad '' metal with a coulomb gap at fermi level .",
    "the temperature dependence of the surface conductance corresponds to the efros - shklovskii conduction at @xmath2  k and the deep valley in sts data at higher temperatures is described in terms of dynamic coulomb approximation with measured localisation length perfectly agrees with interatomic sn atoms distance .",
