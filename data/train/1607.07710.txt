    "numerical simulations and observational inferences suggest that typical star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) at the peak of galaxy assembly activity , @xmath11 , assembled most of their stellar mass via accretion of cold gas , which led to gas - rich , unstable disks and disk - wide star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the isolated , in - situ assembly of typical sfgs is inferred from the presence of a tight relationship between star formation and stellar mass , the `` main sequence '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and from the rarity of compact starbursts at @xmath4 , as indicated by their specific star - formation rate ( sfr ) distribution and infrared color @xcite . at higher sfrs ( @xmath12 @xmath13yr@xmath7  at @xmath4 )",
    ", there is no theoretical consensus on whether mergers or continuous accretion are the dominant triggering mechanism of intense star formation @xcite ; the relative contribution of in - situ versus merger modes at this sfr regime have not been constrained observationally .",
    "contrary to the inferred in - situ assembly of sfgs , _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) observations of main - sequence sfgs at @xmath4 commonly show galactic substructures and asymmetry that are signposts of mergers that drive intense star formation in the local universe @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can also be a natural consequence of gas - rich , turbulent disks evolving in isolation . yet",
    "the role of star - forming clumps in assembling the bulk of stellar mass is debated @xcite and optically - selected clumps altogether contain @xmath15 of the total star formation of their host @xcite . directly observing the distribution of the bulk of star formation in galaxies at @xmath4 is therefore key to establishing the relative contribution between modes of star and bulge formation .",
    "significant progress in directly imaging the distribution of star formation at @xmath16 has been made with spatially - resolved h@xmath17 spectroscopy , e.g. , sins @xcite , kmos3d @xcite , and kross @xcite .",
    "average h@xmath17 maps from 3d - hst , the largest sample thus far of resolved star formation at @xmath18 , show that the star - formation surface density , @xmath19 , on average peaks near the centers of massive galaxies @xcite",
    ". however , the dust extinction also peaks at the center , such that a factor of 6 correction to the inferred h@xmath17 sfr is required in the central kpc ( and more than a factor of 10 close to the center ; * ? ? ?",
    "above sfrs as small as 20 @xmath13yr@xmath7 , which is @xmath20 the typical rate for main - sequence sfgs at @xmath16 , galaxies become so dust enshrouded that almost no light emerges in rest - frame ultraviolet observations @xcite .",
    "the question of where exactly new stars form within typical @xmath4 sfgs is hence a deceptively simple one that is challenging to address .    breakthroughs in this area require sub - arcsecond resolution , extinction - independent star - formation tracers for main - sequence sfgs at @xmath16 , which are now available with the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) and the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) . to this end , we conduct two sensitive , blank - field imaging surveys of the hubble ultra - deep field ( hudf , @xmath2132@xmath22 , @xmath23 ) using the vla and alma at @xmath3 cm and 1.3 mm , respectively , to make @xmath24 resolution images of sfgs at @xmath4 .",
    "the 5 cm continuum traces star formation through the synchrotron emission from supernova remnants , but can be affected by agn emission ; whereas the 1.3 mm continuum traces cold dust associated with star formation , but requires uncertain assumptions about the shapes of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to estimate the sfr .",
    "the combination of the two surveys therefore provide complementary strengths , especially in the hudf where the wealth of ancillary data can help , e.g. , identify agn . by establishing that vla and alma trace the common extent of star formation , alma can serve as a morphological tracer of `` pure '' star formation in agn hosts because the 1.3-mm dust continuum is neither contaminated by agn torus emission @xcite nor synchrotron emission from the jets . furthermore , because alma significantly gains in sensitivity to sfr with the help of negative k - corrections at @xmath25 , whereas the vla gradually loses sfr sensitivity beyond this redshift , the combination of vla and alma yields a sensitive probe of the morphology of star formation over the entire range of @xmath26 .    in this paper",
    ", we present first results from combining the vla and alma hudf surveys , focusing on the extinction - independent distributions of the bulk of the star formation in sfgs at @xmath27 .",
    "we discuss the vla and alma surveys and ancillary data in  [ sec : observations ] and present the size and location of star - formation in sfgs selected from vla and alma , along with their implications in  [ sec : results ] .",

    "the imaging parameters are the following : mt - mfs deconvolver with nterms of 2 , @xmath37 pixel size , and briggs weighting with robust parameter of 0.5 .",
    "we imaged the data well beyond the primary beam radius of @xmath38 ( employing the w - projection ) to mitigate the imaging artifacts caused by the sidelobes from bright sources far from the pointing center .",
    "the final image has @xmath39 synthesized beam and the rms noise at the pointing center of 0.32 @xmath40jybeam@xmath7 , consistent with the theoretical sensitivity ( 0.30 @xmath40jybeam@xmath7 ) .",

    "these stellar - mass maps serve as a reference frame to map where star formation is occurring in relation to stellar - mass buildup within each galaxy .",
    "we further classify the stellar - mass morphologies as isolated or disturbed by performing the asymmetry @xcite and @xmath47 @xcite analysis on these stellar - mass maps , with the @xmath47 being the second - order moment of the 20% brightest pixels , following @xcite .",
    "this classification method is shown by @xcite to be capable of identifying galaxy mergers with a smaller fraction of contamination from clumpy disks compared to single - band classifications .",
    "specifically , @xcite demonstrated that the asymmetry @xmath33 @xmath47 classification results in @xmath48 contaminations when performed on stellar - mass maps , whereas the contamination fraction is @xmath49 using the single - band _ hst_/f160w images alone .",
    "this is because rest - frame optical images often contain optically - bright clumps of star formation in addition to the dominant stellar - mass concentrations ; spatially - resolved sed fitting is required to distinguish them .    the positional accuracy , @xmath50 , with which we can pinpoint the locations of star formation from the vla and alma images depends on : ( 1 ) the positional accuracy of the phase calibrators used as the astrometric reference ( these errors are @xmath51 mas for our observations ) ; and ( 2 ) the snr of the detection , since @xmath52/(2  snr ) , following @xcite , corresponding to @xmath53 40 and 60 mas for vla and alma , respectively , at their detection limits . comparing optical , radio , and millimeter morphologies further requires accurate astrometric alignment between the wave bands .",
    "the positions of emission peaks from the vla and alma images are mutually consistent within 40 mas , corresponding to 0.3 kpc at @xmath54 , indicating good astrometric agreement despite observing different phase calibrators , and neither shows systematic offsets compared to 2mass positions .",
    "the vla primary beam extends beyond the hudf to a total area of 61 arcmin@xmath41 with rms sensitivity better than 1 @xmath40jybeam@xmath7 , co - spatial with the candels imaging @xcite .",
    "this area contains 68 bright point sources ( @xmath55 ) detected in both vla and _ hst_/f160w images that we use to compare vla s astrometry ( and by proxy , alma s ) against _ hst _ s .",
    "an offset of @xmath56 mas , @xmath57 mas is required to bring _ hst _ astrometry into agreement with those of vla and alma .",
    "this offset is constant throughout the field ( a possible source of offset is discussed in d16 ) .",
    "we apply the offset to all _ hst _ images for further analysis ; the resulting median systematic offset is @xmath58 mas in both @xmath17 and @xmath59 , with an rms dispersion of 150 mas .",
    "our sample is based on the alma - selected sfgs at @xmath27 , which d16 has demonstrated are representative of massive main - sequence sfgs at these redshifts . at @xmath27 ,",
    "the d16 sample contains 13 galaxies detected in the alma image at @xmath60 , 11 of these are detected at @xmath61 in the vla image ; the remaining two , udf10 and 15 ( see table 2 of d16 ) , are detected at @xmath62 in the vla image ( they are @xmath63 in the alma image ) , which we exclude from further morphological analysis . since their stellar masses and rest - frame optical extents ( an upper limit of star - formation size )",
    "are similar to the rest of the sample , their exclusion will not bias our conclusions .",
    "the final sample contains 11 galaxies selected from alma and vla , tabulated in table 1 and shown in figure [ fig : sixpana ] .",
    "the sample has a median redshift of @xmath64 and a median sfr and stellar mass of 102 @xmath13yr@xmath7  and @xmath65 @xmath13 , respectively , implying vigorous assembly of stellar mass with a median mass - doubling time of 0.4 gyr .",
    "it is worth noting that there are six vla - detected galaxies in the hudf in the same redshift range that are not detected by alma , these galaxies are at @xmath66 where vla is sensitive to lower sfrs than alma ( e.g. , at @xmath67 , vla detection limit is @xmath68 @xmath13yr@xmath7 , whereas alma is @xmath69 @xmath13yr@xmath7 ) .",
    "likewise , their exclusion will not bias the conclusion for massive galaxies above @xmath70 @xmath13 .",
    "the morphological classification performed on stellar - mass maps (  [ sec : observations ] ) indicates that five and four galaxies are unambiguously isolated and morphologically disturbed , respectively ; the remaining three exhibit sub - structures in stellar - mass maps that could indicate , e.g. , late - stage mergers ( classifications indicated in figure [ fig : sixpana ] ) .",

    "our median sfg radius is similar to those of the star - formation - dominated subsample of @xcite smgs , which has a median r@xmath245 of 2.3 kpc ( their star - forming subsample is reproduced in figure [ fig : sf_size ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the sfg radii from our sample are @xmath259 times larger than those of submillimeter ( sub - mm ) galaxies studied with alma at high resolution ( r@xmath260 kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these sub - mm galaxies have median sfrs @xmath261 times those of our sample , hence an explanation is that the more compact star formation could be a characteristic of this higher sfr regime , but not for main - sequence sfgs ( figure [ fig : sf_size ] ) .    the increasing compactness of sfgs at sfr @xmath262 @xmath13yr@xmath7",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consistent with this trend , the two most intense sfgs in our sample ( udf1 and 2 ) are also the most compact . while the origin of such a trend is at present unclear , if the star - formation rate in the ism is regulated by some internal process ( such as a form of stellar feedback ) , then this result may be expected . at the centers of massive starbursts , the surface densities rise and",
    "the vertical weight on a cloud can hinder the effectiveness of internal feedback processes at dispersing gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in these environments , the star - formation efficiency can rise dramatically , decreasing the effective radius for star formation within the galaxy .",
    "a major result from our observations is that main sequence sfgs at @xmath4 exhibit vigorous star formation in a distributed manner over size scales of a few kiloparsec , which is to be contrasted with the typical sub - kpc size scales of comparably luminous galaxies in the local universe .",
    "such a result is expected from numerical simulations .",
    "the main mode of galaxy growth is typically via in situ star formation which is fed by the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "high - resolution cosmological simulations have found that star formation may remain distributed even in the most extreme systems at this epoch in the submillimeter - selected population @xcite .",
    "we estimate the dust masses from the 1.3 mm fluxes using the @xcite dust mass absorption coefficients .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty in dust mass estimates is the dust temperature t@xmath264 , which is not known precisely for our sample , but _",
    "herschel _ studies have shown that t@xmath264 of main - sequence sfgs at @xmath4 is in the range of @xmath265 k @xcite , prompting us to adopt t@xmath266 k @xcite and estimate the uncertainties using t@xmath267 20 and 30 k for upper and lower limits , respectively .",
    "dust masses are in the range of log(m@xmath264/@xmath13 ) @xmath268 with a typical uncertainty is 0.2 dex ( tabulated in table [ tab : sourcetable ] ) .",
    "the dust mass estimates are in agreement with the @xcite results of stacking analysis for @xmath4 main - sequence sfgs , suggesting that the dust masses of our hudf sample are representative of main - sequence populations at @xmath4 .",
    "if we assume a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 @xcite , the gas fraction , @xmath269 , of our sample is on average @xmath270 , indicating the gas - rich nature of these systems similar to the normal sfgs at @xmath4 studied by @xcite , though significantly more gas rich than typical sub - mm galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the average gas depletion time , @xmath271/sfr , of our sample is @xmath272 gyr , comparable to their average mass - doubling time of 0.4 gyr , assuming that star formation - driven outflows do not result in irreversible mass losses .",
    "these @xmath273 are similar to the main - sequence samples of @xcite and @xcite , further assuring the main - sequence nature of our sample independent of the presence of agn .",
    "we note that if the t@xmath264 is warmer than the assumed 25 k , the gas fraction could be lower ( e.g. , t@xmath274 k implies average @xmath275 and @xmath273 of @xmath272 and @xmath276 gyr ) and hence requires a significant amount of cold gas accretion to sustain their current level of sfrs for a significant period of time . however , the metallicities of our sfgs are expected to be lower than for local analogs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the rapid reduction in dust mass with decreasing metallicity @xcite would then argue for larger gas fractions in these galaxies .",
    "the co - spatiality and the similar effective radii of radio and millimeter emissions imply that in most cases , the cold gas associated to star formation resides in the star - forming regions , which we have shown occur near the stellar - mass concentrations . hence ,",
    "if this level of sfr is sustained through a mass - doubling time , we expect that the newly formed stellar masses will occur near the existing stellar - mass concentrations .",
    "the spatially - resolved @xmath19  for 9 of 11 galaxies peaks within @xmath277 kpc of the stellar - mass distribution ( with the exception of udf3 and 7 ; table 3 ) , and all have @xmath19  in the range of @xmath278 @xmath13yr@xmath7kpc@xmath8  ( median @xmath19  @xmath279 @xmath13yr@xmath7kpc@xmath8 ) , the higher end of which is comparable to local starbursts @xcite .",
    "the level of @xmath19  found in our main - sequence sample is significantly below those found in luminous sub - mm galaxies of @xmath280 @xmath13yr@xmath7kpc@xmath8  @xcite , suggesting very different conditions for star formation between them .",
    "recent studies show that @xmath19  is a strong predictor of star formation - driven outflows at @xmath281 .",
    "an increased broad - fraction of h@xmath17 line flux at @xmath4 associated with star formation - driven outflows is found to strongly depend on @xmath19 , with a @xmath19  of 1 @xmath13yr@xmath7kpc@xmath8  being the threshold above which the large broad line fractions are observed @xcite . at a similar @xmath19  threshold of @xmath282 @xmath13yr@xmath7kpc@xmath8 , @xcite also found a significant increase in the equivalent width of the mg ii absorption line at @xmath283 that indicates cool outflowing gas .",
    "if @xmath19  is indeed a predictor of star formation - driven outflows at these redshifts , we expect that main - sequence sfgs like those in our sample , whose galaxy - average @xmath19  are larger than these threshold levels ( table 3 ) , will harbor outflows across a significant extent comparable to the areas of stellar - mass buildup ( i.e. , galaxy - wide ) .",
    "while the _ presence _ of outflows appears to depend on @xmath19 , how does outflow _ rate _",
    "depend on @xmath19  is not well established , especially for molecular gas in a turbulent galactic environment at @xmath4 .",
    "if a strong relationship also exists between them , we expect that the areas exhibiting large @xmath19  near galaxy centers will also be the areas with the largest outflows .",
    "future spatially - resolved observations of cold gas dynamics could provide definitive evidence whether this intense , galaxy - wide star formation also drives galaxy - wide outflows .      in  [ sec :",
    "frc ] , we have shown that the 4 ms _ chandra _ observations in the hudf allows us to detect x - ray agn candidates residing in main - sequence sfgs with varying degrees of radio emission enhancement over the level corresponding to their sfrs .",
    "six of 11 galaxies in our sfg sample are detected in x - rays , with the most luminous reaching l@xmath284 ergss@xmath7 .",
    "two among the x - ray detected sfgs ( udf3 and 11 ) are only detected in the soft x - ray band ( @xmath285 kev ) , suggesting that their x - ray emission could originate solely from star formation .",
    "however , udf11 also has radio emission enhanced by more than twice the level associated with star formation ( figure 2 left ; this level of radio enhancement is @xmath286 the scatter around the emission level implied by the far - ir / radio correlation ,  [ sec : frc ] ) that suggests a presence of radio agn .",
    "omitting the only ambiguous case of udf3 from the agn sub - sample , the agn fraction ( 5 of 11 galaxies ) is still higher than typically reported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at these redshifts , but not unexpected since agn activity is known to depend on both stellar mass and gas mass as evident by its clear dependence on star formation of its host even on a galaxy - wide scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the alma continuum detections at 1.3 mm preferential to the most massive galaxies with high sfrs at @xmath287 ( d16 ) ,",
    "such selection is also effective at probing rapidly - growing supermassive black holes at @xmath4 including those with mild obscuration .",
    "further support of such a high detection rate of agn using alma comes from @xcite who report a high x - ray agn fraction in the ssa22 field .    despite the high sensitivity of the _ chandra _ observations in the hudf , the x - ray counts in the full @xmath137 kev band for 4 of 6 agn candidates are still low ( @xmath288 counts ) , highlighting the necessity of sensitive x - ray observations to characterize agn populations in main - sequence sfgs at @xmath4 . in the remaining two sources with sufficient count statistics , udf1 and udf 8 , which have 434 and 878 full - band counts , respectively , the column densities are @xmath289 and @xmath290 cm@xmath8 respectively , based on web - pimms , provided by heasarc , assuming an intrinsic photon index of 2 and the redshift of the source , indicating mild obscuration .",
    "independent of the agn selection method , alma imaging shows that all agn candidates in the sample contain large amounts of cold dust and gas ( table 1 ) associated with star formation .",
    "the trend of the star formation size with sfr shown in figure 3 is consistent to the alma 870  sizes of star formation in the hosts of six x - ray detected agn that have sfrs of @xmath292 @xmath13yr@xmath7  @xcite .    for udf7 , 11 , and 13 where the radio flux enhancement allows pinpointing the agn location using the vla images , we find that the agn are within 0.5 kpc of the barycenter of star formation of their host galaxies as measured from the alma images ( an upper limit of given by our ability to pinpoint agn and star formation given their s / n ) . for udf11 and 13 ,",
    "the star - formation concentrations are @xmath293 kpc from the stellar - mass barycenters , whereas udf7 is notable for these activities being @xmath294 kpc away from the dominant stellar - mass concentration , a possible consequence of galaxy interactions .",
    "we have made the first comparison between ultra - deep vla and alma imaging of @xmath4 main - sequence sfgs .",
    "the far - infrared / radio correlation appears to hold for individual main - sequence sfgs out to @xmath295 and the extinction - independent distributions of star formation are consistent between the data sets .",
    "the intense star formation in our blank - field - selected sample extends over a large galactic area regardless of their stellar - mass morphology ( isolated or morphologically disturbed ) or the presence of agn , with the sfr and dust - mass surface densities both peaking near the existing stellar - mass concentration .",
    "these findings provide direct - imaging evidence of a gas - rich galactic environment with widespread occurrence of intense star formation .",
    "the spatially - resolved sfr surface densities are sufficiently large across the areas of dominant stellar - mass buildups that they may drive galaxy - wide outflows . where radio excess permits pinpointing of the agn , it is found to be co - spatial with the dust mass concentrations .",
    "the median star - formation diameter in our main - sequence sfgs sample is @xmath5 kpc , two times larger than those of sub - mm galaxies forming stars at @xmath9 times higher than the main - sequence sfgs , indicating that , at @xmath4 , the sfr threshold above which a significant population of more compact sfgs appears to emerge is @xmath10 @xmath13yr@xmath7 .",
