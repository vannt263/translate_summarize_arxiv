    "two - dimensional coulomb systems are models which have attracted some attention . on a two - dimensional manifold ,",
    "a coulomb system is a system made of particles interacting through the corresponding coulomb potential plus perhaps some short - range interaction . in a plane , the coulomb interaction energy of two particles of charges @xmath0 and @xmath1 , separated by a distance @xmath2 , is defined as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is some ( irrelevant ) length .",
    "some time ago , it has been shown that the free energy of such systems has a universal finite - size correction @xcite very similar ( except for its sign ) to the one which occurs in a system with short - range forces at a critical point @xcite : for a finite coulomb system of characteristic size @xmath5 , the free energy @xmath6 has the large-@xmath5 behaviour    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the inverse temperature . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are non - universal constants describing the bulk and boundary contributions , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 is the universal correction , depending only on the euler number @xmath12 which describes the topology of the manifold on which the system lives .",
    "however , the general derivation @xcite of ( [ eq : finitesize ] ) had some heuristic features .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to check ( [ eq : finitesize ] ) in the special case of a one - component plasma on the surface of a sphere , by a different method .",
    "the one - component plasma is a system made of one species of point - particles of charge @xmath0 in a uniform neutralizing background . on a sphere of radius @xmath5",
    ", the interaction between two particles can be chosen @xcite as @xmath13 $ ] , where @xmath14 is the angular distance ( seen from the sphere centre ) between the two particles .",
    "there are also particle - background and background - background interactions .",
    "a dimensionless coupling constant is @xmath15 .",
    "a sphere has no boundaries and its euler number is @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , for a given particle density , @xmath17 is proportional to the number of particles @xmath18 .",
    "thus , expansion ( [ eq : finitesize ] ) becomes @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a constant .",
    "the model is exactly solvable @xcite when @xmath21 and it can be checked @xcite that ( [ eq : ffinitesize ] ) is obeyed in that case .",
    "also , exact calculations @xcite for finite values of @xmath18 at @xmath22 and @xmath23 are well fitted by ( [ eq : ffinitesize ] ) .",
    "the present derivation of ( [ eq : ffinitesize ] ) relies on a recent result @xcite about the direct correlation function @xmath24 of the plane one - component plasma . by a diagrammatic analysis",
    ", it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the second moment of the short - range part @xmath25 has the simple value @xmath26 a remarkable feature of ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) is its universality , in the sense that it is independent of the coupling constant @xmath27",
    ". it will now be shown how ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) leads to ( [ eq : ffinitesize ] ) .",
    "more specifically , we show how ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) implies the finite - size correction to the chemical potential @xmath28 : @xmath29 this derivation bears some similarity with another one about the two - component plasma @xcite .",
    "we consider the ocp of average density @xmath30 on the sphere of radius @xmath5 ( with a corresponding number of particles @xmath31 ) .",
    "introducing the stereographic projection of the sphere onto the plane @xmath32 tangent to its south pole ( see figure 1 ) , we map the homogeneous ocp on the sphere onto a modified inhomogeneous plasma on the plane , with local particle density @xmath33 in terms of planar coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the interaction potential between two particles on the sphere with angular distance @xmath36 can be written as the sum of the planar two dimensional coulomb potential @xmath37 $ ] and one - body terms since : @xmath38 = -\\ln\\left[\\frac{|{\\bf r}_1-{\\bf r}_2|}{l } \\right ] \\,+\\ , \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\ln\\left(1+\\frac{r_1 ^ 2}{4 r^2 }    \\right ) \\,+\\ , \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\ln\\left(1+\\frac{r_2 ^ 2}{4 r^2 }    \\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : potential}\\ ] ] the two one - body terms appearing on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) , as well as the metric , create a central potential and we can consider the projected planar system as a ocp interacting through the standard pair potential @xmath39 , in an external one - body central potential @xmath40 .",
    "the latter acts as a confining mechanism ensuring the proper density given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : density ] ) , and its detailed form need not be precised . without background ,",
    "the free energy @xmath41 for the set of particles with pair potential @xmath39 can be formally expanded in a mayer diagrammatic representation @xcite , with a leading term @xmath42 for the excess ( over ideal ) part of @xmath41 .",
    "the presence of a neutralizing background cancels this mean - field electrostatic term and the intrinsic free energy functional of the inhomogeneous ocp becomes : @xmath43 = { \\cal f}'[n({\\bf r } ) ] - \\frac{1}{2 } \\int n({\\bf r})\\ ,   v_p({\\bf r},{\\bf r}')\\ , n({\\bf r } ' ) \\ , d^2{\\bf r}\\ , d^2{\\bf r'}. \\label{eq : free}\\ ] ]    the local chemical potential reads @xmath44}{\\delta n({\\bf r } ) }        = \\frac{\\delta { \\cal f}'[n]}{\\delta n({\\bf r } ) } - \\int v_p({\\bf r},{\\bf r}')\\ ,       n({\\bf r}')\\ , d^2{\\bf r } '   \\label{eq : chemical}\\ ] ] and the second functional derivative of @xmath45 yields : @xmath46}{\\delta",

    "equation ( [ eq : secondder ] ) emphasizes the short range dependence of the chemical potential on a density perturbation .",
    "consequently , @xmath48 is the same in a finite @xmath18-particle ocp in the central potential @xmath40 and in the limit @xmath49 with an external potential @xmath50 ensuring the same density variation around the origin as expression ( [ eq : density ] ) , namely : @xmath51 for the purpose of the present analysis , it is sufficient to truncate ( [ eq : density ] ) after second order in @xmath2 , as becomes clear below .",
    "the knowledge of the finite - size correction to the chemical potential for the ocp on the sphere then amounts to computing the shift @xmath52 induced by switching @xmath50 starting from the infinite homogeneous planar ocp with density @xmath30 ( corresponding to the stereographic projection of the `` spherical '' plasma in the thermodynamic limit @xmath53 ) .",
