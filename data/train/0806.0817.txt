    "the notion of logarithmic coarsening in two dimensions here refers to the behaviour of the density of interfaces with time , whereas the dynamical exponent , relating to the correlation length and properties of the dynamical structure factor , is still found to be @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is due to the critical nature of the voter model , as unveiled using field theoretic approaches @xcite .",

    "we show that despite the presence of interfacial noise , in two dimensions the asymptotic behavior is compatible with the low ( but non - zero ) temperature regime of model a relaxational dynamics .",
