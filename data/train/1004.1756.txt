    "the number of quasars has increased substantially in the last decade primarily due to two large optical sky surveys , namely the two degree field ( 2df ) survey ( boyle et al . 2000 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)(york et al .",
    "2df has obtained spectroscopy of more than 20,000 quasars ( croom et al .",
    "2004 ) , and sdss has identified more than 100,000 quasars ( schneider et al . 2007 ; abazajian et al . 2009 ) .",
    "quasar candidates in these surveys were mainly selected based on their optical colours derived from the photometric data .",
    "2df mainly selected lower redshift ( @xmath8 ) quasars with uv - excess ( @xmath9 - 0.36)(smith et al . 2005 ) , while sdss adopted a multi - band optical colour selection method for quasar selection mainly by excluding the point sources within the stellar locus of the colour - colour diagrams ( richards et al .",
    "90% of sdss quasars have lower redshift ( @xmath10 ) , although some dedicated methods were also developed for discovering high redshift quasars ( fan et al .",
    "2001a , b ; richards et al .",
    "the lower efficiency in identifying quasars with redshift between 2 and 3 is obvious in sdss ( schneider et al .",
    "2007 ) , because these quasars usually have similar optical colours as stars and thus are mostly excluded by the sdss quasar candidate selection algorithm ( warren et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in order to obtain a more complete sample of quasars ,",
    "obviously we need to improve the previous quasar candidate selection methods",
    ". an important way to do this has been suggested by using the infrared k - band excess to identify the ` missing ' quasars with redshift around 2.7 based on the ukirt ( uk infrared telescope ) infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) ( warren et al .",
    "2000 ; hewett et al . 2006 ; maddox et al .",
    "although the @xmath112.7 quasars have similar optical colours as stars , they are more luminous in the infrared k - band . in addition , combining the optical colours in sdss with the infrared colours in ukidss , it should be more efficient to separate stars from both lower redshift quasars ( @xmath123)(chiu et al . 2007 ) and higher redshift ones ( @xmath136 ) ( hewett et al .",
    "2006 ) in the colour - colour diagrams .",
    "this advantage needs to be confirmed by future spectroscopic observations on the larger sample of quasar candidates selected with the sdss and ukidss photometric colours .",
    "multi - band colours are also crucial for the photometric redshift estimations of quasars . based on the sdss colour - z relations ,",
    "about 70% of the photometric redshifts of quasars are consistent with the spectroscopic ones with the difference @xmath5 ( richards et al .",
    "2001 ; wu et al . 2004 ; weinstein et al .",
    "this percentage can increase to 85% or higher if the extra galex uv photometric data ( ball et al . 2007 ) or spitzer irac data ( richards et al .",
    "2009b ) are added .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the photo - z accuracy should be improved if combining the ukidss infrared photometry with the sdss optical photometry for galaxies ( maddox et al .",
    "such improvement can be also expected for quasar candidates with both sdss and ukidss photometric data , but has not been confirmed by the photometric redshift estimations on a large sdss - ukidss quasar sample so far . in addition , the reliable photometric redshift estimations based on multi - band colours are also important for preparing the quasar candidates for the future spectroscopic surveys ( richards et al . 2009a ) .",
    "large quasar survey is one of the key projects of the chinese large sky area multi - object fibre spectroscopic telescope ( lamost ) , which is a novel reflecting schmidt telescope with 4 meter effective mirror size , 20 square degree field of view ( fov ) and 4000 fibres ( su et al .",
    "1998 ) . as the most efficient optical spectroscopic telescope in the world",
    ", lamost finished its main construction in 2008 and has entered the commissioning phase . a pilot survey and the regular survey",
    "have been planned in 2010 and 2011 - 2015 respectively . unlike sdss",
    ", lamost does not have its own photometric survey .",
    "therefore , the input catalogue of lamost quasar survey will largely rely on the photometric data from other existing surveys .",
    "because of the large overlap of the surveyed area between sdss and ukidss , a combination of sdss and ukidss photometric data is expected to help us to efficiently select a large catalogue of quasar candidates and provide reliable photometric redshifts for the lamost quasar survey .    in this study , we first present a large quasar sample with both sdss and ukidss data , and then investigate whether there is a more efficient selection criterion for quasars and whether the combination of ukidss data can improve the photometric redshift estimations . as two tests ,",
    "the results are applied to a small ukidss / edr quasar / star sample and a sample of the variable sources in the sdss stripe 82 region .",
    "the implications of our study to the future lamost quasar survey are also discussed .",
    "note : all colours are derived from magnitudes in vega system .",
    "the @xmath14 colour at @xmath15 , @xmath16 colour at @xmath17 and other colours at @xmath18 are adopted from table 26 of hewett et al ."
