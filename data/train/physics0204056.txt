    "these folded diagrams originate from the second - order valence energy correction ( the first - order correction is zero in the frozen - core hartree - fock basis ) .",
    "since both the ccsd method and its linearized version fully recover the second order energies  @xcite , in our approach we have omitted contributions of the folded diagrams .    finally , we would like to comment on a possible all - order extension of the derived fourth - order contributions .",
    "ideally , the entire fourth order set of diagrams would be recovered by fully treating the triple and nonlinear double excitations within the traditional coupled - cluster approach .",
    "however , at the present state of computer technology such a full treatment hardly seems feasible in relativistic calculations . at the same time",
    "the coupled - cluster expansion truncated at the single and double excitations ( ccsd method ) presents an attractive starting point .",
    "the triple excitations may be treated semi - perturbatively , i.e. , the triple excitations are replaced by a combination of `` bare '' coulomb interaction and an all - order ccsd double excitation  @xcite .",
    "the following modifications of the ccsd method should be made to partially sum the derived diagrams to all orders of perturbation theory : ( i ) four classes of the derived diagrams ( @xmath136 ) , z_{0 \\times 3}(d_v[t_v ] ) , z_{0 \\times 3}(s_c[t_c ] ) , z_{0 \\times 3}(d_v[t_c])$ ] ) may be accounted for by amending the traditional ccsd equations with a semi - perturbative contribution of triple excitations .",
    "two of the desired modifications , @xmath84 $ ] and @xmath81 $ ] , were considered previously in ref .",
    "( ii ) in the diagrams @xmath126 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 the bottom and the upper ( closing ) coulomb interactions should be replaced by all - order double excitation amplitudes .",
    "this generalization follows from considering the relevant contributions in the coupled - cluster method .",
    "( iii ) in the @xmath141 diagrams all the coulomb interactions should be replaced by all - order double excitation amplitudes .",
    "( iv ) the linearized coupled - cluster expansions should include terms nonlinear in double excitations to recover the diagrams @xmath140 in all - order fashion .",
    "an improvement of the accuracy of _ ab initio _ coulomb - correlated calculations is necessitated by the latest experimental and theoretical progress in studies of parity violation in alkali - metal atoms .",
    "such improvement may possibly be achieved by augmenting powerful all - order techniques by contributions missed in a given order of many - body perturbation theory .",
    "we derived and analyzed the entire set of fourth - order many - body diagrams for a one - particle operator .",
    "we highlighted the fourth - order contributions omitted in the popular coupled - cluster approach truncated at single and double excitations ( ccsd ) . to recover the full set of fourth - order diagrams one",
    "should additionally consider the effect of triple excitations .",
    "in addition , the linearized version of ccsd should be augmented by nonlinear contributions of double excitations .",
    "we presented explicit formulas for such complementary contributions in the appendix .",
    "the representative diagrams may be found in fig .",
    "[ fig_z4 ] .",
    "we also proposed a possible extension of the derived fourth - order contributions to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "the derived expressions may be useful for an analysis of the completeness of all - order methods in the fourth order of perturbation theory and for designs of next - generation approximations in atomic many - body calculations .",
