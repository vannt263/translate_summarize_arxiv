    "domain walls ( dws ) represent the most fundamental type of robust structures which are supported by immiscibility in a variety of binary physical systems . commonly known are dws in magnetics @xcite , ferroelectrics @xcite , and liquid crystals @xcite . in those media ,",
    "the immiscible species are emulated by different orientations of a vectorial order parameter .",
    "similarly organized are dws separating temporal - domain regions occupied by light waves with orthogonal circular polarizations in bimodal optical fibers @xcite .",
    "binary bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) formed by immiscible atomic species , or immiscible hyperfine states of the same atom , make it possible to study the formation of dw structures in superfluids .",
    "these structures were studied theoretically in a number of different settings @xcite , including the extension to bec with linear interconversion between the immiscible components @xcite , condensates with long - range dipole - dipole interactions @xcite , three - component spinor bec @xcite , and the bec effectively discretized by trapping in a deep optical - lattice potential @xcite .",
    "in addition to the condensates , degenerate bose gases have been also experimentally realized in the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) state @xcite , using tight quasi - one - dimensional traps @xcite ( for a review of the tg model see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this context , a macroscopic ( mean - field - like ) description of the tg gas was proposed in terms of the quintic nonlinear schrdinger equations nlse @xcite and adopted for various settings @xcite@xmath0@xcite . in this framework , it was demonstrated that oscillation frequencies derived from the fermionic hydrodynamic equations , which emulate the hard - core tg gas , are very close to their counterparts predicted by the quintic nlse @xcite .",
    "the nlse approach was employed to investigate particular nonlinear features of tg states , including dark solitons @xcite , bright solitons formed by the long - range dipole - dipole interactions @xcite , etc .",
    "exact solutions for the ground state in mixtures of tg and fermi gases have been found too @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the mean - field approach does not apply beyond the framework of the hydrodynamic regime  in particular , to problems such as merger of two gas clouds into one @xcite .",
    "recently , however , the ground state of the binary tg mixture trapped in the harmonic - oscillator potential was constructed , using the density - functional theory with the local - density approximation @xcite .",
    "coupled quintic nlses emerge in this case too ( although only for particular parameter settings ) , where they were used to investigate mainly miscible ground states .",
    "one expects that dws , both in bec and in tg gases , can exist only in the case of immiscibility .",
    "dws were indeed observed experimentally in immiscible binary becs @xcite .",
    "dws have been also investigated in other physical systems described by systems of continuous or discrete nlses , both conservative and dissipative .",
    "in particular , dws were found in one - dimensional ( 1d ) heisenberg ferromagnets as front patterns , both at the classical @xcite and quantum heisq level .",
    "similar structures were also found in a dissipative discrete nlse @xcite and in coupled ginzburg - landau equations modeling convection patterns in 2d @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "however , dws of immiscible binary gases with quintic interactions , of both bec and tg types , have not been investigated yet .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to address the existence and stability of dws and bubble - droplet ( bd ) states in binary mixtures of immiscible bec and tg gases . to this end",
    ", we introduce a system of nonlinearly - coupled cubic - quintic ( cq ) nlses , which describes , in proper situations , both bec mixtures and binary tg gases . as concerns",

    ", we derive a class of exact dw solutions , with equal background amplitudes and equal intra - species and inter - species interactions ( symmetric dws ) .",
    "the existence and stability of asymmetric dws in the bec mixtures with dissimilar background amplitudes and interactions in the two components , as well as of symmetric and asymmetric dws in the binary tg gas , is demonstrated by means of numerical and approximate analytical methods .",
    "it is shown too that dws can be easily put in motion by phase imprinting .",
    "we also show that , by combining a dw with an anti - dw on a ring , it is possible to construct , for both bec and tg gases , bd excitations , consisting of a dark ( gray ) soliton in one component ( the  bubble \" ) , and a bright soliton ( the  droplet \" ) in the other . in the bec system ,",
    "such composite excitations are found to be mobile as well .",
    "finally , our estimates suggest that , using the feshbach - resonance technique to control the strengths of the inter- and intra - species repulsion in a binary bose gas loaded into a quasi-1d trap , the observation of dws and bds should be possible in experiments .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model equations , for which exact symmetric dws and the immiscibility condition are explicitly derived .",

    "( [ rel ] ) then yields , for the dw solution , the single admissible value of the chemical potential of species @xmath136 : @xmath137thus there remain three free parameters : coefficient @xmath11 of the inter - species quintic interaction , along with @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "we have checked by means of numerical methods that dw solutions exist for a wide range of values of parameters @xmath140 away from the fully - symmetric - interaction limit considered in the previous section .",
    "two typical examples of such numerically found dws are depicted in fig .",

    "in addition to the dw , a physically relevant state may be the bd complex similar to those studied above for the bec mixture . in the general case ,",

    "then , the general family of such solutions depends on four independent parameters : @xmath11 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath127 [ the latter constant is no longer determined by an additional condition , such as eq .",
    "( [ mu2 ] ) ] .",
    "in this work , we have introduced the concept of dws ( domain walls ) in the two - component tg ( tonks - girardeau ) gas , as well as in the binary bec described by coupled gpes ( gross - pitaevskii equations ) with cq ( cubic - quintic ) nonlinearities .",
    "thus , we have extended the concept of dw previously elaborated for immiscible binary bec , described by the system of two coupled gpes with cubic terms .    in several cases , exact or approximate analytical solutions have been found . in particular , for the binary bec with the cq nonlinearity ,",
    "exact solutions for dws were obtained in the symmetric system , with equal intra - species scattering lengths . for the existence of these solutions ,",
    "the presence of the quintic interactions is necessary .",
    "numerical analysis was used to prove the existence and stability of asymmetric dws in the bec mixtures with asymmetric cq interactions in the two components .",
    "in addition to the dws , we have also investigated db  ( droplet - bubble ) complexes in the same settings , which consist of a dark ( gray ) soliton in one component ( the  bubble \" ) , and a bright soliton ( the  droplet \" ) in the other . in the bec system , the dws and db states are mobile , keeping their shape in the state of motion .",
    "we have also introduced symmetric and asymmetric dws in the binary tg gas , for which the system of two coupled nlses ( nonlinear schrdinger equations ) with quintic - only repulsive terms was adopted . in particular , we have showed that a tg mixture with equal atomic masses and fully symmetric interactions [ as per eq .",
    "( [ equal ] ) ] sits precisely at the immiscibility threshold , therefore dws and bds exist only as metastable states in this case . the va ( variational approximation ) and numerical analysis ,",
    "however , demonstrate the existence of stable dws ground states at a small deviation from the full symmetry .",
    "stability of dws and bd complexes in bec mixtures with symmetric and asymmetric cq interactions in the two components has also been demonstrated . in this respect , we have derived a general condition for the immiscibility , which is valid for both the bec and tg settings .",
    "the stability of the dw and bd states is secured if the immiscibility condition is satisfied .",
    "it is relevant to discuss possible implementations of the above results in experimental settings .",
    "dws and anti - dws can be observed ( either being separated , or merged into bd complexes ) in toroidal quasi - one - dimensional traps for gases with scattering lengths tuned so as to satisfy the immiscibility condition .",
    "note that toroidal traps are routinely created in laboratories with the aid of magnetic fields @xcite , and , as said above , the scattering length can be easily changed via the feshbach - resonance technique .",
    "to create bd complexes in the ring , one can load the gases into two different semicircles of the trap , initially kept separated by laser sheets , which are slowly removed after the loading .",
