    "the high - transition - temperature superconducting quantum interference devices ( high - t@xmath0 dc squids ) each consisting of two bicrystal josephson junctions are key elements for many sensitive instruments such as extremely low noise magnetometers@xcite , the series- and parallel- squid arrays@xcite , the superconducting quantum interference grating@xcite , etc .    however , the further developments of these devices are limited by significant on chip spreading in the critical current and normal resistance of high @xmath7 josephson junctions which seems to be unavoidable for grain - boundary junctions.@xcite .",
    "the different values of critical current and normal resistance of two josephson junctions result in turn in the vast spreading of the output voltage - current ( vcc ) and voltage flux ( vfc ) characteristics for on chip high t@xmath0 dc squids@xcite .",
    "the influence of the junction asymmetry on the output characteristics of high @xmath7 dc squids has been analyzed in@xcite , where it was shown that the transfer function for asymmetric squids can be substantially differ from that of symmetric squids .",
    "the extensive comparison of experimental characteristics of intentionally fabricated asymmetric high @xmath7 dc squid with computer simulations has been performed in @xcite , where in most cases a reduction of the voltage - to - flux transfer function of the asymmetric squid as compared to the symmetric squid has been observed .    from the other point",
    "the output characteristics of high @xmath7 dc squids can be used to infer the information about the on chip distribution of the critical currents and normal resistances of the josephson junctions@xcite .    in known experiments@xcite",
    "the asymmetry of critical current of two josephson junctions in dc squid loop has been determined indirectly from the measured flux shift of the voltage - flux curve . since for high @xmath7 josephson",
    "junctions the density of critical current and the resistivity of the junction are interrelated , it also influences the value of the last quantity .",
    "in addition , as is shown in the paper , this method has a restricted range of validity .",
    "that is why , as was noted in@xcite , a clear - cut comparison between simulation and experimental data requires the independent experimental determination of the current and resistance asymmetry .",
    "therefore , the main purpose of our paper is the independent and direct determination of the current and resistance asymmetry and the investigation of the influence of the junctions asymmetry on the scattering over the chip of the main output parameters of dc squid , i.e. , its voltage modulation , voltage - to - flux transfer function , flux shift .    to this end",
    "we investigated 20 purposely made asymmetric high @xmath7 dc squids .",
    "for the first time we measured independently and directly the current and resistance asymmetry for every junction in the interferometer loop . we show that the main reason for the junctions asymmetry is the on - chip spreading in the resistivity and the critical current density . even for a geometrically symmetric design of the interferometer",
    "the critical current densities of the two junctions may be substantially different .",
    "we found that , in general , both the voltage modulation and the transfer function are not very sensitive to the junctions asymmetry , whereas the flux shift of the vfc shows approximately linear dependance on asymmetry parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the current and resistance asymmetry for the junctions of dc squid are defined and the analytical expressions for transfer function and flux shift for asymmetric dc squid are given .",
    "the experimental part of the paper is in detail described in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to an extensive analysis of the influence of squid asymmetry on the transfer function and flux shift of vfc .",
    "obtained results are shortly summarized in section v.",

    "+    in order to describe the junctions asymmetry we define the average values of the critical current @xmath13 and resistance @xmath14 , and a current asymmetry @xmath15 and a resistance asymmetry @xmath16 as follows : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 @xmath22 note that the squid critical current @xmath23 and its resistance @xmath24 are being measured directly from the voltage - current characteristic of the dc squid .",
    "there are two different origins of the junction asymmetry : geometrical asymmetry and intrinsic asymmetry@xcite . for bicrystal grain boundary",
    "junctions geometric asymmetry is associated with the different width @xmath25 of the junctions .",
    "we describe geometric asymmetry by the parameter @xmath26 according to @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "the intrinsic asymmetry is associated with different values of the current density @xmath30 and the resistivity @xmath31 for two junctions .",
    "we describe intrinsic asymmetry by the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 according to@xcite :    @xmath34    the parameters of intrinsic asymmetry @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be obtained from the independent measurements of the parameters of the bulk asymmetry @xmath15 , @xmath16 and geometric asymmetry @xmath26@xcite : @xmath35 since high @xmath7 josephson junctions obey the scaling law @xmath36@xcite , the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are interrelated to each other@xcite @xmath37      in general , the output voltage across asymmetric squid is the complicated function of several dimensionless parameters@xcite : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the bias current ) ; @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the fluctuation inductance which is equal approximately to 100 ph at t=77 k ) ; @xmath43 ; @xmath44 is the noise parameter ( @xmath45 is boltzmann constant , @xmath46 is absolute temperature ) ; @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the external magnetic flux , @xmath49 is the flux quantum ) .",

    "thus , the quantity @xmath53 can be used as one of the measure of squid asymmetry .",
    "it is a periodic function of the applied flux and it depends on the bias current and on the parameters of asymmetry .    the second property which is known for a long time ( see , for example , ref .",
    ") is the shift of the voltage - flux characteristic ( vfc ) under reversal of the bias current .",
    "the shift is commonly attributed to the asymmetry in the critical current of the two junctions : @xmath54 this property has been widely used for experimental determination of the current asymmetry @xcite . however",
    ", the expression ( [ shift1 ] ) can not describe some experimental facts .",
    "in particular , it does not depend on the bias current while the experimental flux shift does depend on @xmath55 . for large inductance dc",
    "squids the picture is more complicated @xcite .",
    "there is no simple relation between current asymmetry and a flux shift .",
    "in addition , asymmetry in resistance contributes also to the total flux shift .",
    "the expression for the flux shift under a reversal of the bias current is as follows@xcite :    @xmath56    the explicit expression for the quantity @xmath57 which is too cumbersome one can find in ref .",
    "as is seen from ( [ shift3 ] ) the flux shift is a complicated function of the bias current and the parameters of asymmetry .",
    "the dependance on squid inductance @xmath8 is hidden in the second term in ( [ shift3 ] ) . due to the relation @xmath51 this term",
    "can be written as @xmath58 , which is equivalent to the expression found for the flux shift in the limit of a large bias current @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that for @xmath59 the voltage - flux curve is shifted to the negative side of the flux ( @xmath60 ) relative to a symmetric voltage - flux curve , while for the reversed bias ( @xmath61 ) the voltage - flux curve is shifted to the positive side of the flux ( @xmath62 ) .      as is known , the shape of experimental vfc is not symmetric .",
    "the asymmetry of the junctions induces distortion of the @xmath63-curves , which leads to different values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the maximum positive and negative slope of the @xmath63-curves , respectively .",
    "the impact of the asymmetry on the transfer function has been studied by computer simulations in ref . .",
    "it was shown that the normalized transfer function @xmath66 can be factorized as @xmath67 .",
    "the explicit analytical expressions for the quantities @xmath68 and @xmath69 for limited range of parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) have been given in ref . .",

    "the slit lengths are reflected in squid inductance ranges of l@xmath7565 - 75 ph , l@xmath75125 - 135 ph and l@xmath75185 - 195 ph for the s , m and l squids , respectively . within the groups ,",
    "parameters of asymmetry were varied , using various junction widths @xmath76 and @xmath77 between 0.4 and 1.2 @xmath74 m .",
    "all squids were connected via a common superconducting line , which was used to inject a dc current i@xmath78 into the squids .",
    "figure [ photo ] shows a photograph of three squids connected that way .",
    "+    the squids were fabricated using a standard thin - film technology , which was described in detail in ref . .",
    "using laser ablation , a 140 nm thick ybco film is deposited onto a 24@xmath4 mgo bicrystal substrate with 10 mm x 10 mm x 1 mm dimension . on top of the non - structured ybco film",
    "a 100 nm thick gold layer was deposited by thermal evaporation and subsequently structured by lift - off .",
    "finally , the ybco layer was patterned using standard e - beam lithography and ion - beam - etching . as already shown in @xcite , josephson junctions with widths down to 0.4 @xmath74 m",
    "show no degradation in critical current density .",
    "in addition , the chip was covered by a teflon layer which protected it from water during thermo cycling @xcite .",
    "then the squid chip was glued on a non - metallic holder with a wire - wound coil beneath , which was used to apply magnetic flux to the squids .",
    "all measurements were performed in liquid nitrogen at 77 k in a well shielded environment .",
    "first , for every squid we have measured its voltage - current ( vcc ) and voltage - flux ( vfc ) characteristics .",
    "second , one of the two junctions in the loop was measured directly . for that after all the measurements at the squids have been performed , all squid loops have been cut to allow the independent measurements of the characteristics of one junction per squid . to do that the right superconducting arm of every squid loop was removed by additional optical lithography and chemical etching .",
    "this allowed to measure the critical current and normal resistance of the josephson junction in the remaining arm of the squid .",
    "therefore , we determined for the first time independently and directly the current density and resistivity for every junction in the interferometer loop which allowed us to investigate their influence on the squid characteristics .",

    "since the vfc is @xmath49 periodic , the flux shift can be determined with an accuracy @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is an integer .",
    "thus the minimum uncertainty of the determination of the flux shift for asymmetrical squids is @xmath102 .    in an ideal case",
    "when there is no parasitic trapped flux in the loop , both vfcs are shifted symmetrically by the same amount @xmath103 in opposite directions with respect to zero flux point . in this case the overall flux shift is calculated as a sum of both shifts , @xmath104 . however , in our cases the shift of two vfcs is not symmetric with respect to zero point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is the parasitic flux @xmath105 trapped in a loop .",
    "this flux does not change its sign under bias reversal , hence the flux shifts are as follows : @xmath106 , @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the flux shift for the vfc for reversed bias current ( @xmath98 ) , and @xmath109 is the same quantity for the unreversed vfc ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "thus , the parasitic flux disappears from the overall flux shift @xmath110 .",
    "the application of this simple formula requires precise knowledge of the corresponding extremums of the vfcs shifted by a parasitic flux .",
    "in other words , we must know these two extremum points on both vfcs whose distance provides us with the overall flux shift .",
    "however , since vfc is @xmath49 periodic , it is not possible to definitely determine these two points .",
    "therefore , a single valued determination of the flux shift requires some additional information .",
    "the procedure we used for the unique determination of the actual flux shift , @xmath111 was performed in three steps .",
    "first , we measured the flux shift @xmath94 between the _ nearest _ extremum points of vfcs with respect to the zero flux point .",
    "second , by using expression ( [ shift3 ] ) we calculated for a given squid a theoretical value of the flux shift @xmath112 .",
    "finally , the actual flux shift @xmath111 was determined by subtracting from ( or adding to ) @xmath94 the integer number of flux quanta @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) which gave the flux shift nearest to the theoretical value @xmath112 .",
    "the illustration of our method is presented in table [ flux shift determination ] .",
    "the values of actual flux shift from the last column of this table are given as @xmath88 in the second column of table [ tab : table2 ] .",
    "we want to stress here that in our method the theoretical estimations of the flux shift were used only as a guide for the determination of the actual flux shift caused by the predetermined asymmetry .",
    "this differs from many other papers on the subject ( see , for example , ref . ) where theoretical expression ( [ shift1 ] ) itself has been used for the determination of asymmetry parameters . in this latter case",
    "there are not any means which allow a unique discrimination between the unshifted curve and the curve shifted by a parasitic flux .",

    "it turned out that the values of current and resistance asymmetry ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) were randomly distributed over a chip without noticeable correlation either with squid inductance or critical current . even for geometrically symmetric squids ( we had 9 such squids ) there was a significant asymmetry in critical current and resistance .",
