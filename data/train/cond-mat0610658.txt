    "physical properties of two - dimensional ( 2d ) graphene planes are a subject of current interest due to their unique transport properties.@xcite some of these properties originate from peculiarities of the corresponding electronic structure , or more specifically from the peculiar fermi surface of a 2d graphene plane , which consists of six points located at the corners of the corresponding hexagonal 2d reciprocal lattice.@xcite only two of these points , however , are nonequivalent . apart from this , the low energy excitations at these points can be approximated by the energy dispersion relation linear in the wavevector .",
    "such electron states can be described by the dirac equation ( therefore , the corresponding points of the brillouin zone are also termed as the dirac points ) .",
    "all these features of the electronic structure make graphene very attractive from both theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "this is because graphene is an ideal natural system for testing various theoretical models of 2d electron transport , including for instance the quantum hall effect , or the effects due to the geometrical berry phase.@xcite    as concerns magnetic properties of graphene , these are still a subject of discussion in the relevant literature .",
    "some experiments indicate on the existence of a spontaneous magnetic moment of the graphene planes.@xcite however , physical origin of the spontaneous magnetization is not well understood .",
    "several distinctly different mechanisms leading to ferromagnetism of graphene have been proposed , including the instability of the paramagnetic phase due to electron - electron interaction,@xcite indirect rkky exchange coupling between magnetic moments of structural defects _ via _",
    "mobile electrons,@xcite and others.@xcite    the indirect exchange interaction between local magnetic moments is generally determined by electron excitations near the fermi energy .",
    "assuming that the fermi momentum in a graphene plane is zero and the excitations are gapless , a non - oscillatory indirect exchange interaction of the rkky type has been found in ref .",
    "[ ] . moreover , the corresponding exchange integral was found to be ferromagnetic , with the range function decaying as @xmath0 with the distance @xmath1 between magnetic moments .",
    "however , the intrinsic spin - orbit ( so ) interaction in graphene has been neglected in ref .",
    "such an interaction in graphene opens an energy gap at the fermi level,@xcite and makes the usual rkky mechanism not relevant due to the absence of electrons at the fermi level .",
    "therefore , another mechanism of the indirect interaction between magnetic moments of structural defects should be developed .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the indirect exchange interaction in graphene , taking into account the role of intrinsic so interaction .",
    "if the so gap is relatively small , the excitations across the gap contribute to the indirect exchange interaction.@xcite we show that the exchange coupling is ferromagnetic , and the corresponding range function decays exponentially with the distance between magnetic moments  provided the chemical potential lies in the gap .",
    "moreover , the spin - spin coupling is shown to be described approximately by the isotropic three - dimensional ( 3d ) heisenberg hamiltonian . apart from this",
    ", the interaction is shown to be dependent on the location of magnetic impurities ",
    "the interaction for impurities located in the same sublattice is different from that between impurities located in different sublattices .",
    "indirect exchange interaction between magnetic moments of structural defects ( for instance impurities ) is determined by the electronics structure of the relevant system . to describe electron states in a graphene plane",
    ", we assume the hamiltonian of non - interacting electrons in the following form@xcite : @xmath2 where three types of the pauli matrices ; @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , have been introduced .",
    "these matrices operate in different spaces , so their products in eq.(1 ) should be understood as the direct matrix product . the matrix @xmath5 acts in the ( real ) space of two nonequivalent sublattices .",
    "the matrix @xmath6 , in turn , acts in the ( reciprocal ) space of two nonequivalent dirac points , whereas the matrix @xmath7 operates in the electron spin space . finally , the constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 in eq.(1 ) are the velocity of electrons near the fermi level ( in the limit of no intrinsic so interaction ) , and the parameter of so interaction , respectively .",
    "as we have already mentioned above , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) operates in the 8-dimensional space , and describes electrons in the vicinity of two nonequivalent dirac points located at the corners of the brillouin zone , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 denoting the lattice constant .",
    "the wavevector @xmath14 in eq .",
    "1 is measured from the location of a given dirac point .",
    "the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) consists of four - fold degenerate dispersion curves given by @xmath15 as follows from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the so interaction opens a gap in the electronic states around the fermi level , which extends from @xmath16 to @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the interaction of 2d electrons with magnetic impurities located at @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) in the graphene plane can be described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath19 \\left ( { \\bf s}_i\\cdot \\bsig \\right ) \\",

    "the parameter @xmath24 distinguishes the two ( a and b ) sublattices  if a given impurity belongs to the sublattice a ( b ) then @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this form of interaction accounts for the exchange coupling that is sensitive to the location of the magnetic impurities in the two sublattices .",
    "however , the interaction ( 3 ) does not take into account the intervalley transitions .",

    "the interaction between in - plane spin components ( @xmath52 ) is given as @xmath53 where @xmath54 on the other hand , the interaction of the out - of - plane spin components is expressed _ via _ the formula @xmath55 with @xmath56 the interaction described by eqs .",

    "the asymptotics of macdonald functions at large argument,@xcite @xmath58 , leads to the exponential decrease of interactions , @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath62 determines an effective range of the exchange interaction .",
    "the magnitude of the indirect exchange interaction depends on the relative position of the spins in the graphene sublattices .",
    "as mentioned above , the exchange interaction is described by an anisotropic heisenberg model .",
    "however , @xmath630.1 cm , so the anisotropy is weak and one may approximate the exchange interaction by a 3d - isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian , irrespective which sublattice the magnetic impurities belong to .",

    "( 16 ) is the term similar to that derived in ref .",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the gap due to spin - orbit interaction induces an exponential decay of the range function , even in samples with low density of non - magnetic impurities .",
    "the indirect exchange interaction is ferromagnetic .",
    "the numerical results in fig .  1 show the absolute value of the interaction energy when the interacting moments are in the same or different sublattices . in our estimations",
    "we used the carbon - carbon distance @xmath67   , the fermi velocity @xmath68  ev   , @xmath69  ev , @xcite and @xmath70  k. @xcite from the unit cell area of @xmath71 containing two carbon atoms , one can estimate the coupling coefficient @xmath72  ev  @xmath73 . in order to illustrate the range function dependence on @xmath74 , we took into account the scaling coefficient @xmath75 .",
    "the numerical results explicitly show the exponential decay of the range function with the distance between two magnetic impurities .",
    "moreover , they also demonstrate that the coupling is stronger when the magnetic moments are localized on different sublattices .",
    "the exchange interaction between a magnetic impurity and 2d electrons gives rise to a spin polarization of the latter ones .",
    "the corresponding spin density distribution @xmath76 can be calculated as a response of the electron system to the perturbation due to a single magnetic impurity @xmath77 at @xmath78 . as a result",
    ", one finds @xmath76 in the form @xmath79    the assumed exchange interaction between a magnetic impurity and 2d electrons is local , see eq .",
    "( 3 ) . as a result ,",
    "the spin polarization at a given point of the lattice , mediated via the 2d electrons , is sensitive to the location of the magnetic impurity ( in one sublattice or the other ) , see eq .",
    "( 16 ) .",
    "performing calculations similar to those presented above one finds @xmath80 the above result shows that spin polarization has no oscillatory component .",
    "apart from this , one can conclude from eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 19 ) , that the @xmath34-component of magnetic density @xmath76 is nonzero only in the case when the magnetic impurity has a non - vanishing spin component perpendicular to the graphene plane .",
    "as we have already mentioned above , graphene has two nonequivalent valleys in the brillouin zone , which are associated with two dirac points .",
    "moreover , the exchange coupling between localized moment and 2d band electrons assumed in eq .  3 does not allow for intervalley transitions .",
    "however , such transitions are allowed by symmetry of the system and should be taken into account . to do this we consider an additional term in the interaction between a localized moment and band electrons .",
    "this new term may be written in the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the corresponding coupling parameter .",
    "the above form of interaction between 2d band electrons and localized moments gives rise to additional terms in the indirect exchange interaction .",
    "these terms are of oscillatory type , @xmath83 .",
    "however , we believe that the coupling coefficient @xmath82 is much smaller than @xmath22 , so the main results and conclusions described above will not be changed by including the contribution following from the interaction ( 20 ) .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the indirect exchange interaction between two magnetic impurities localized in a graphene plane .",
    "the interaction is mediated by two - dimensional electrons and holes , and acquires the form of an isotropic 3d heisenberg coupling , with the coupling parameter being of ferromagnetic type .",
    "the exchange parameter has an exponentially decaying long distance tail determined by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "thus , graphene doped with magnetic impurities may become ferromagnetic at a certain impurity concentration and below a certain temperature .",
    "magnetic graphene could be then an ideal system for experimental investigations of 2d transport of spin polarized electrons .",
    "moreover , one may also expect that magnetic graphene could be very useful in spintronics devices , where electron spin plays a role comparable to its charge.@xcite    we have calculated the exchange interaction for @xmath84 .",
    "strictly speaking , our results refer to @xmath85 .",
    "the effect of temperature on the exchange interaction in narrow - gap semiconductors has been studied by rusin,@xcite who showed that for the chemical potential in the gap , the temperature corrections do not change the main result : even for @xmath86 , the interaction at large distances is exponentially decaying .    when calculating the exchange interaction we assumed the chemical potential @xmath87 .",
    "the results do not change for a finite @xmath88 as long as the chemical potential is located within the energy gap , which corresponds to the undoped material . in principle , the chemical potential in graphene can be varied either by a gate voltage or by doping with impurities . as a result , the chemical potential can be shifted into the conduction or valence bands , and the interaction between magnetic impurities includes then the usual rkky exchange term _ via _ free carriers . as in conventional metals or doped semiconductors , this gives an additional oscillating term with the oscillation period determined by the fermi momentum of electrons ( holes ) .",
    "however , the mechanism of exchange interaction considered in this paper is still working for @xmath89 .",
    "the resulting interaction is then due to both the virtual transitions of electrons through the gap and the excitations of real electron - hole pairs in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "magnitude of so interaction in graphene was recently a subject of extensive discussion in the relevant literature.@xcite a similar problem was also discussed in the case of carbon nanotubes.@xcite some results indicate that the so interaction in graphene can be very small .",
    "however , the key point is that this interaction is nonzero , which results in a finite exchange interaction length .",
    "as we have shown in this paper , the nonzero so interaction leads to some anisotropy of the magnetic interaction between magnetic ions .",
    "the energy gap in graphene can be also induced by excitonic effects.@xcite , thus being not related to the spin degrees of freedom . as a result ,",
    "the exchange interaction mediated by virtual transitions through the excitonic gap @xmath90 acquires the finite length @xmath91 .",
    "the magnetic interaction is then strictly isotropic .",
