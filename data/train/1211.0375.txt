    "group - iv transition metals and alloys have attracted great scientific and technological interests since their particular applications in the aerospace , atomic energy industry , nuclear reactor , and chemical industry .",
    "the three group - iv metals that occur naturally are titanium ( ti ) , zirconium ( zr ) and hafnium ( hf ) .",
    "titanium is recognized for its high strength - to - weight ratio with low density , meanwhile , the corrosion resistance , the heat stability , and the ductility are of benefit .",
    "the foremost use of hafnium and zirconium has been in nuclear reactors due to their corrosion resistance .",
    "hafnium has a high thermal neutron - capture cross - section while zirconium possesses a rather low one , therefore , they can be used as control rod and cladding of fuel rods in nuclear reactors respectively @xcite . properly , hafnium and zirconium are used in nickel - based super alloys to improve their mechanical properties @xcite .",
    "the titanium , hafnium and zirconium are complete solid solution between each other .",
    "the appropriate solution of these metals will help to improve the mechanical or thermal properties .",
    "scientifically , most interests are attracted in their narrow @xmath5-band in the midst of a broad @xmath6-band , where an increase in @xmath5-electron population by transfer from the @xmath7 band is the driving force behind the structural and electronic transitions @xcite .",
    "the pressure - induced phase transformation sequence has received extensive experimental as well as theoretical attention @xcite . at room temperature and under compression ,",
    "hf undergoes a crystallographic phase transition from hcp ( @xmath1 phase ) to the hexagonal structure ( @xmath2 phase ) at about 38@xmath88 gpa @xcite . upon further compression ,",
    "hf has been observed to transform into the bcc structure ( @xmath3 phase ) at 71@xmath81 gpa @xcite . for ti ,",
    "the measured phase transition sequence at room temperature is @xmath9 @xcite , and the @xmath3 phase has not yet been observed up to 216 gpa @xcite .",
    "however , the recent theoretical investigation @xcite found that the @xmath10 phase is not stable under hydrostatic compression , and the @xmath10 phase should be replaced by @xmath3 phase at zero kelvin .",
    "the absence of the high - pressure @xmath3 phase for ti in experiments was attributed to the possible nonhydrostatic stress which distorts the @xmath3 phasse @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium phases at ambient pressure of the hf - ti system have been tabulated by several studies @xcite , containing the liquid , and the @xmath3 and @xmath1 phases of the solid .",
    "the @xmath11 phase transition for the equiatomic hfti alloy has been measured to be @xmath121200 k at ambient pressure . however , up to now , the effects of pressure on the phase transition of hfti alloy have not been reported yet .",
    "the stability of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 phases of hfti alloy also need for testing to support their practical application .",
