    "this study is undoubtedly one of the basic works in the field and has been referred to frequently in analyzing experimental results on the quantities .",

    "indeed , even the empirical inequality @xmath10 will be shown violated in some cases in two dimensions , even without the spin paramagnetism.@xcite    the starting point adopted for these purposes is the quasiclassical eilenberger equations.@xcite as emphasized by eilenberger@xcite and also by serene and rainer,@xcite the quasiclassical equations have an advantage over gorkov equations@xcite that they are easier to solve due to the absence of an irrelevant energy variable .",
    "they have a rigorous microscopic foundation and hence form a firm basis for any quantitative description of superconducting / superfluid fermi liquids.@xcite thus , it seems somewhat surprising that few calculations on @xmath1 have been performed based on the eilenberger equations.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows .",
