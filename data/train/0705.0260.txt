    "in the cold and dense interstellar regions in which stars are formed , co and other molecules collide with and stick to cold ( sub)micron - sized silicate particles , resulting in icy mantles @xcite .",
    "chemical models of these regions show that all molecules except for h@xmath0 are removed from the gas phase within @xmath4 years , where @xmath5 is the total hydrogen number density @xcite . for a typical density of @xmath6 @xmath7 ,",
    "this time scale is much shorter than the estimated age of such regions and hence molecules like co should be completely frozen out in these clouds . yet",
    ", these clouds are detected in the millimeter lines of gaseous co @xcite .",
    "similarly cold co gas has been detected in the midplanes of protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "a recent study of several disks @xcite even finds that the bulk of the gaseous co is at temperatures lower than 17 k , below the condensation temperature onto grains .",
    "thus some desorption mechanism is needed to keep part of the co and other molecules in the gas phase .",
    "clarifying this desorption mechanism is important in understanding the physical and chemical evolution of interstellar clouds .",
    "because the sticking probability of even volatile species like co has been shown to be unity @xcite , it is the desorption mechanism and rate that controls the allocation of molecules between gas and solid phase .",
    "this allocation of molecules affects the gas phase and surface reactions as well as the dust properties .",
    "the case of co is of particular importance , as it is the most common molecule after h@xmath0 and the prime tracer of molecular gas .",
    "it is also a key constituent in the formation of more complex and pre - biotic species @xcite , and its partitioning between the grain and gas phase therefore has a large impact on the possible chemical pathways @xcite . in dense clouds without embedded energy sources ,",
    "the grain temperature is low enough , around 10 k , that thermal desorption is negligible and hence desorption must occur through photon or cosmic ray induced processes .",
    "external uv photons from the interstellar radiation field can penetrate into the outer regions of dense clouds and cosmic rays are always present , even in the most shielded regions .",
    "photodesorption has been proposed as an important desorption pathway of ices in protoplanetary disks and other astrophysical regions with dense clumps of material and excess uv photons @xcite .",
    "the lack of experimentally determined photodesorption rates for most astrophysically relevant molecules and conditions has prevented progress in this area , however , and theoretical estimates range by orders of magnitude , with desorption rates from 10@xmath8 to 10@xmath9 co molecules uv - photon@xmath10 @xcite . due to this low estimated rate , co photodesorption has generally been regarded as an insignificant process in astrophysical environments .    as the present study shows ,",
    "this assumption is not correct , and the actual desorption rate is at least two orders of magnitude larger than the previous high estimate . here",
    ", we present the results of an experimental study under astrophysically relevant conditions of the photodesorption rate of co ice and of the mechanism involved .",
    "the experimental set - up has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite . in these experiments , thin ices of 2 to 350 monolayers ( ml )",
    "are grown at 15  k on a gold substrate under ultra - high vacuum conditions ( @xmath11 mbar ) .",
    "the ice films are subsequently irradiated at normal incidence with uv light from a broadband hydrogen microwave discharge lamp , which peaks around 125 nm and covers 120170 nm ( 710.5 ev ) @xcite .",
    "the lamp has a uv photon flux , measured with a nist calibrated silicon diode , of @xmath12 photons s@xmath10 @xmath13 at the substrate surface in its standard setting .",
    "the emission resembles the spectral distribution of the uv interstellar radiation field that impinges externally on all clouds as well as that of the uv radiation produced locally inside clouds by the decay of electronic states of h@xmath0 , excited by energetic electrons resulting from cosmic - ray induced ionization of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the setup allows simultaneous detection of molecules in the gas phase by quadrupole mass spectrometry ( qms ) and in the ice by reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy ( rairs ) using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer .",
    "once an ice is grown , it remains stable until it is uv irradiated .",
    "the layer thickness of the ice is monitored by recording rair spectra ( fig .",
    "the intensity of the co rairs profile is linearly correlated with the layer thickness of the co ice up to @xmath1420 monolayers ( ml ) .",
    "one monolayer is generally taken to consist of @xmath1410@xmath15 molecules @xmath13 and the rate of the co photodesorption is subsequently derived from the intensity loss in the rair spectra as function of time ( fig .",
    "2 ) . from this loss of ice molecules and the known photon flux hitting the surface it is possible to calculate the desorption rate as the number of molecules desorbed per incident photon . re - condensation will play a negligible role given the small surface area of the sample and the resulting unterestimate of the actual photodesorption will be substantially lower than other sources of inaccuracy . above 20 ml the photodesorption rate",
    "can no longer be calculated from the rairs profile as the integrated absorbance of the peak is no longer linearly dependent on the number of molecules . instead",
    "a relative photodesorption rate can be determined by mass spectrometry of the desorbed gas phase molecules .",
    "this rate is converted to an absolute photodesorption rate by comparison with thin layer experiments where both qms and rairs data are available .",
    "simultaneous mass spectrometry of gas phase constituents shows that only co molecules are desorbed .",
    "furthermore the rairs results show that no other molecules are formed during the uv irradiation ( i.e. less than 0.2% of the co ice is converted to co@xmath0 after 8 hours of irradiation of 8 ml co ice ) .",
    "this result is of importance as in traditional vacuum experiments with substantially thicker and less pure ices , reaction products have been identified upon uv photoprocessing @xcite and this may affect the photodesorption efficiency .    in these experiments the thickness of the ice , which is needed to determine the desorption rate , was calculated from the observed difference in desorption from multilayer coverages ( constant rate ) and monolayer coverages ( decreasing rate ) . from the rair spectra at this turning point , the integrated absorbance of 1 ml is estimated to within 20% .",
    "the original thickness of the ice can then be calculated from the integrated absorbance of the rairs feature before onset of desorption .",
    "this technique is based on the assumption that the ice is quite flat , which is confirmed by the results of the experiments .",
    "the evaluation of the experiments results in a constant rate of ( 3@xmath161 ) @xmath17 co molecules photon@xmath10 , averaged over the wavelength range of the lamp .",
    "this rate is fully reproducible from repeated experiments of 8 ml coverage and has a standard deviation of @xmath1415% ( fig .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute value is somewhat larger , up to 30% , dominated by the uncertainty in the uv photon flux and coverage .",
    "the thickness of the co ice has been varied between 2 and 350 ml .",
    "we find that the photodesorption rate of co is independent of the ice thickness ( fig .",
    "this suggests that only the upper layers are involved in the photodesorption event .",
    "it is also consistent with a surface that is quite smooth , since at 2 ml the entire surface must still be covered to achieve the same photodesorption rate as for 350 ml . to confirm that the desorbed molecules only originate from the top layers we performed experiments with two layers of ices comprising different co isotopologues .",
    "when 2 ml of c@xmath18o is deposited on top of 8 ml of c@xmath19o the desorption rate from the bottom layer drops with less than 20% .",
    "in contrast depositing 4 ml of c@xmath18o on top of 8 ml of c@xmath19o ice reduces the c@xmath19o desorption rate with more than 80% .",
    "this confirms that mainly the top few layers of the co ice are directly involved .",
    "furthermore , the co photodesorption rate is directly proportional to the photon flux within the flux range covered here ( @xmath20 photons s@xmath10 @xmath13 ) .",
    "in contrast to previous findings on h@xmath0o photodesorption @xcite , we find that the co photodesorption rate is independent of the total photon dose as well as the irradiation time , as long as 1 ml is left on the surface .",
    "the mass signals show an onset of the photodesorption within the time constant of our qms system ( a few seconds ) when the uv source is turned on .",
    "in addition to the experiments on co ices , a thin layer of n@xmath0 ice ( 8 ml ) was irradiated under the same conditions as the co ices with the aim to compare the two photodesorption rates .",
    "it is found that n@xmath0 has no detectable photodesorption in the present set - up , which puts an upper bound to the photodesorption rate of pure n@xmath0 ice of 2 x 10@xmath21 molecules uv - photon@xmath10 .",
    "the above experiments can be used to constrain the co photodesorption mechanism .",
    "its insensitivity to layer thickness ( demonstrated in fig .",
    "3 ) indicates that only molecules from the top layers of the ice contribute to the photodesorption flux .",
    "in addition , it suggests that the co photodesorption mechanism at these uv wavelengths does not involve the substrate .",
    "the linear dependence of the photodesorption rate on the uv intensity is not consistent with that the desorption is due to sublimation caused by heating of the ice as a whole .",
    "together these results suggest that co photodesorption occurs through a single photon - process , which is further supported by the immediate on - set of the desorption once the uv lamp is turned on .",
    "the opposite conclusion has previously been drawn for h@xmath0o @xcite .",
    "the final support for a single - photon process is given by the different desorption rates for co and n@xmath0 ice .",
    "the two molecules have similar inter - molecular binding energies and ice structures @xcite , which suggests that any difference in photodesorption rate must involve the internal structure of the molecules .",
    "a relevant difference between the two species is that co has an electric dipole allowed transition in the vacuum ultraviolet ( 710 ev ) @xcite , exactly where the hydrogen lamp simulates the interstellar radiation field , while n@xmath0 does not .",
    "this transition corresponds to the solid state equivalent of the a@xmath22-@xmath23 electronic excitation of gaseous co and the most plausible photodesorption mechanism hence involves this transition .",
    "after uv absorption , the excited molecule relaxes via a radiationless transition into vibrationally excited states of the electronic ground state which subsequently transfer part of this intramolecular energy to the weak intermolecular bonds with neighboring co molecules , resulting in a desorption event .",
    "this desorption event may consist of more than the originally excited molecule desorbing , but experiments with mixed co / n@xmath0 ices are necessary to constrain this part of the mechanism in more detail .",
    "the single photon mechanism of co photodesorption means that the rate derived from these experiments can be easily applied to astrophysical environments without concerns about ice thicknesses and irradiation field strengths .",
    "it is illustrative to compare the photodesorption rate with other possible desorption routes in dark clouds .",
    "since thermal desorption is negligible , species can only be kept in the gas phase through ice desorption induced by uv photons and cosmic rays .",
    "while cosmic rays have been proposed to directly desorb ices @xcite , the efficiency of heating an entire grain to the required desorption temperature rapidly drops with grain size so that usually only spot heating at an estimated rate of 70 molecules @xmath13 s@xmath10 is considered as a viable mechanism .",
    "the cosmic rays also produce uv photons so that the total photodesorption rate depends on both the external interstellar radiation field and the uv field produced inside the cloud by the cosmic rays . for a typical galactic cosmic ray flux ,",
    "the resulting uv photon flux is of the order of @xmath6 photons @xmath13 s@xmath10 with a factor of 3 uncertainty @xcite .",
    "we calculated the desorption rate due to photodesorption in a dark cloud and compared this with the desorption due to spot - heating from @xcite .",
    "equations [ eqn1 ] and [ eqn2 ] describe the photodesorption rates of co molecules from grain surfaces in molecules @xmath13 s@xmath10 due to external and cosmic ray induced uv photons , respectively , where @xmath24 is the strength of the external irradiation field with energies 6 - 13.6 ev , @xmath25 the strength of the uv field due to cosmic rays , @xmath26 is a measure of uv extinction relative to visual extinction , which is @xmath142 for small interstellar grains @xcite , and @xmath27 is the experimentally determined photodesorption rate .        applying this model shows that photodesorption dominates at the edge of the cloud and becomes comparable ( within the uncertainties of a few ) to spot heating in the interior of a cloud , i.e. beyond a depth corresponding to an extinction of 34 a@xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . in the interior of the cloud the photodesorption rate due to cosmic rays is @xmath1430 molecules @xmath13 s@xmath10 , which is equivalent to @xmath31 molecules grain@xmath10 s@xmath10 for grains with a 0.1 @xmath32 m radius . a rate of this magnitude may on its own explain the gas phase co seen in dark clouds @xcite . in comparison with the other plausible non - thermal desorption mechanisms , photodesorption has the advantage that the rate can now be determined experimentally and unambiguously included in astrophysical models .",
    "one particularly interesting application of our derived photodesorption rate is to the case of co in protoplanetary disks , where large abundances of cold co - gas is observed .",
    "@xcite argue that the cold co - gas can be explained by vertical mixing and @xcite by a combination of radial and vertical mixing of disk material . with the high photodesorption rate of co derived here , non - thermal desorption of co",
    "may suffice to explain these observations .",
    "an important characteristic of disks compared to dense clouds is dust coagulation , which reduces the absorption of the external uv field since larger grains absorb less efficiently at short wavelengths . in eq .",
    "[ eqn1 ] this corresponds to @xmath33 @xcite , assuming the grains have grown to at least @xmath32 m size as indicated by infrared observations of the silicate feature from the surfaces layers of the inner disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and by millimeter observations of the outer disk showing growth up to mm size ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the photodesorption rate due to external photons then dominates over other non - thermal desorption rates up to a@xmath34 , but detailed modeling is necessary to determine whether this rate is high enough to offer an alternative to the turbulence theory in explaining the observed co gas .",
    "it is clear , however , that photodesorption can no longer be ignored in astrophysical models and may explain a large part of the gas observed in cold and dense regions .",
