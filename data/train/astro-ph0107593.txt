    "the x - ray source  is a bright low - mass binary located within 2  of the core of the globular cluster m15 ( = ngc  7078 ) .",

    ", the natural conclusion is that  is an accretion disk corona ( adc ) source observed at a sufficiently high inclination that the bulk of the direct x - ray emission is obscured by azimuthal disk structure .",
    "however , the detection of a very luminous x - ray burst from the source with the ginga satellite ( dotani et al .  1990 ; van paradijs et al .  1990 ; hereafter `` the 1988 burst '' ) not only revealed that the compact object must be a neutron star , but also that it must be viewed directly with no intervening obscuration .",
    "the 1988 burst from  had a long duration ( in excess of 150s ) , a peak luminosity of 5.1@xmath110@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 , and a total energy release of 6.3@xmath110@xmath4 ergs ( correcting the distance to 10.4  kpc ; see below ) , placing it amongst the brightest of the observed type i x - ray bursts .",
    "a bright precursor was seen 6 seconds prior to the main event , and spectral fitting revealed strong photospheric radius expansion during the burst , followed by contraction and a cooling phase . in the first 30s of this contraction , slow radius oscillations occurred ( dotani et al .  1990 ;",
    "van paradijs et al .  1990 ) .    per unit mass , low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are @xmath0100 times more likely to be found in globular clusters than in the galaxy as a whole , and they are almost certainly formed by the tidal capture of compact objects , an efficient process within globular clusters because of the high local number density of stars ( fabian , pringle , & rees 1975 ; hut et al.1992 ) .",
    "the bursts observed from the 12 known globular cluster lmxbs @xmath9 erg  s@xmath3 have a special significance because we have relatively accurate information about ( a ) their distance , and ( b ) the elemental abundances of the regions in which they were formed .",
    "the m15 cluster has a low mean metallicity of @xmath00.01 solar ( sneden et al .",
    "1991 ; geisler et al .  1992",
    "; harris 1996 ) , although the local metallicity of the accreted material in the  system may , of course , have been altered from this by evolutionary effects .    in this paper",
    ", we report the observation and analysis of a second burst from , 12 years after the first .",
    "the burst reported here shares many of the characteristics of the earlier event , being highly energetic with radius expansion , a high peak luminosity , and a multi - peaked profile ; however , its main energy release is of shorter duration , leading to a lower total energy , and no precursor is observed .",
    "we observed  with _ rxte _ ( bradt , rothschild , & swank , 1993 ) on 2000 august 24 04:3610:31  ut , and then for a series of pointings spanning 2000 september 17 12:02  ut ",
    "september 23 02:36  ut , for an on - source total good time of 150  ksec . the data presented here were obtained using the `` standard 2 '' mode with 16s time resolution , and an event mode with 16@xmath10sec time resolution and 64 channels covering the full energy range of the pca .",
    "the pca consists of five xe proportional counter units ( pcus ) numbered pcus 0 through 4 , with a combined total effective area of about 6500 @xmath11 ( jahoda et al .",
    "pcus 0 , 2 , and 3 were reliably on throughout the observation , and the data shown here are from these detectors .",
    "data were reduced using the _ rxte _ standard analysis software included in ftools 5.0.1 , and we used xspec 11.0 for our spectral analysis . where necessary a small instrument - related deadtime correction ( 6% ) has been applied to the derived pca fluxes .",
    "errors on spectral fit parameters are quoted to 90% confidence .",
    "c    the burst was observed during the september sequence , at 2000 september 22 13:47:41  ut , a time corresponding to phase @xmath7=0.79@xmath60.03 in the binary cycle of , well away from the partial eclipse . in figure  1",
    "we show the intensity profile of the burst in the 225  kev range .",
    "the profile has a complex structure , with an initial fast rise to a first emission peak in @xmath120.5s , followed by three further peaks in the overall counting rate separated from the first by 3.75s , 11.0s , and 21.5s ( all such times in this paper are quoted to @xmath60.25s accuracy unless otherwise stated ) .",
    "the burst took the source from its persistent emission rate of 90 c / s to a maximum of 11,000 c / s , after which it decayed with a _ 1/e_-folding time of 30s .",
    "the effects of the burst are still visible in the x - ray spectra 300s after its initial rise .",
    "a full timing analysis was performed on the burst data : no slow ( @xmath030s ) radius oscillations or fast ( 100  hz1200  hz ) coherent oscillations or qpo were detected .",
    "the energy dependence of the burst profile is illustrated in figure  2 . in the 1.93.5  kev band",
    "the initial energy release appears gradual , extending over 6s . at the highest energies the burst appears as a bright 1s pulse , followed by a more gradual 20s rise and an almost - symmetrical decay .",
    "such energy - dependent double peaking in type i bursts has long been recognized as the signature of photospheric radius expansion in bursts reaching the eddington luminosity ( hoffman , cominsky , & lewin 1980 ; lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1993 ) .    c    to study the physical morphology of the burst in more detail , we extracted a series of spectral slices through the event with a time resolution of 0.25s , and performed spectral fits to them over the 2.515  kev energy range .",
    "our first pass ultimately proved to be the most satisfactory : we fit a simple blackbody function to the burst spectra , using as background a 300s section of persistent - emission data from immediately prior to the burst .",
    "experimentation showed that the hydrogen column density was poorly constrained by the data , leading us to fix it at a nominal value of @xmath1310@xmath14 @xmath15 , consistent with previous observations ( e.g. sidoli et al .",
    "these fits produced acceptable values of @xmath16 throughout the burst .",
    "no improvements were gained using more sophisticated fitting models that include comptonization of the blackbody component or modification of the blackbody by electron scattering ( nishimura , mitsuda , & itoh 1986 ; nakamura et al .",
    "1989 ) , or a contribution from disk reflection of the burst emission ( day & done 1991 ) .",
    "we saw no indications of transient narrow absorption or emission features in the spectra .    in figure  3 , we plot the variation of the bolometric luminosity , the blackbody temperature @xmath17 , and the derived apparent blackbody radius @xmath18 through the burst as a function of time .",
    "( at the temperatures and densities found on accreting neutron stars , the compton scattering opacity dominates over the absorption opacity , reducing the emissivity below that expected for a true blackbody .",
    "thus , this method measures the color temperature rather than the effective temperature @xmath19 .",
    "we will return to this point in the discussion section . ) in the lowest panel we see clear evidence for photospheric radius expansion ; the apparent radius increases in 5.6s to a maximum envelope radius of @xmath18=118@xmath65  km , followed by an even more rapid collapse to @xmath18=29.0@xmath61.5  km over the next 1.0s .",
    "after this point the apparent radius contracts at a more steady rate to a minimum value of 8.6@xmath61.0  km , 20s after the initial burst rise . as is common in radius expansion bursts , the measured blackbody temperature mirrors the behavior of the derived radius . after an initial temperature peak during the first 1.0s of the burst , the temperature drops sharply during the photospheric expansion phase . during the subsequent contraction",
    ", the temperature climbs back to its peak value of @xmath17=2.70@xmath60.13  kev , and then cools exponentially as the blackbody radius stabilizes . in calculating the luminosity",
    "we assume that the radiation is isotropic and that the source is located at a distance of @xmath20=10.4  kpc ( durrel & harris 1993 ; harris 1996 ) .",
    "the luminosity peaks at a value of 6.5@xmath110@xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 , and over the whole 300s interval where the effects of the burst are detectable , the total integrated burst energy is 1.85@xmath110@xmath4  ergs .    c    while it is common practice in burst spectral studies to subtract off the continuum emission prior to fitting , it is well - known that this is a source of potential error ( e.g. lewin et al .",
    "if there are two components to the persistent emission , and one component originates on the neutron star or in the boundary layer around it , this component of the emission may either increase or disappear during the burst itself , meaning that the `` continuum background '' is either underestimated or overestimated .",
    "this can lead to an erroneous decrease in the apparent blackbody radius particularly towards the end of the burst , where the flux level is low .",
    "in addition , for bursts that approach or exceed the eddington limit , the possibility exists that the global accretion onto the neutron star itself may be suppressed , leaving the burst itself as the _ only _ source of x - ray emission for the brief duration of the burst .",
    "we investigated both of these possibilities to determine whether they affect our results .",
    "the persistent continuum emission prior to the burst ( and , in fact , through the whole rxte observation ) can be well fit using either a straightforward cut - off power law with index @xmath21=1.63@xmath60.16 , @xmath22=8.2@xmath61.8  kev , @xmath16=26/36 , or with a combination of a powerlaw plus blackbody , with @xmath21=2.42@xmath60.11 , @xmath17=1.43@xmath60.16  kev , @xmath16=20/35 , with the blackbody providing @xmath020% of the total flux . in the first formulation",
    ", there is no contribution from the region on or around the neutron star ; adopting the second , we repeated our series of fits through the burst , holding the powerlaw component constant and allowing the continuum@xmath23burst blackbody component to vary .",
    "we found that the continuum blackbody contribution was a sufficiently small addition that it had a negligible effect on figure  3 and on the physical numbers quoted below .",
    "( the broadband 0.1100 kev spectrum of  was found to be well - described by a partially - covered powerlaw plus a disk blackbody ( sidoli et al .",
    "2000 ) ; our spectroscopy results are consistent with this model , though the pca lacks the sensitivity to the lowest energies provided by the sax lecs instrument that would enable us to perform a detailed study of partial covering over the limited intensity variations found in these data . )",
    "we next repeated our series of burst fits assuming a cessation of persistent emission during the burst , and fitting a blackbody to the overall emission with only the relevant instrumental pca background subtracted .",
    "this produced poor fits to the individual spectra , with large systematic errors in the residuals , indicating that the assumption was invalid and that persistent emission does indeed continue unabated during the burst .",
    "a comparison of the 1988 and 2000 bursts from  shows that there are strong similarities between the two events .",
    "both show multiple peaks in their x - ray light curves in count- and flux- space , and both show indisputable evidence for radius expansion and a qualitatively similar evolution of flux and blackbody temperature and radius .",
    "the bursts have peak luminosities of @xmath24=5.3@xmath110@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 and 6.5@xmath110@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 respectively ; peak blackbody temperatures of @xmath17=2.87@xmath60.03 kev and @xmath17=2.70@xmath60.13 kev ; and developed from comparable levels of continuum emission ( @xmath25=5.0@xmath110@xmath26  erg  @xmath15  s@xmath3 and @xmath25=4.2@xmath110@xmath26  erg  @xmath15  s@xmath3 over the 128  kev range ) ( dotani et al .  1990 , van paradijs et al .  1990 , and above , assuming @xmath20=10.4  kpc ) .",
    "the bursts differ in the maximum extent of their photospheric expansion  @xmath271000 km and @xmath27120 km respectively  and in their timescales .",
    "the 1988 burst reached its maximum radius expansion after @xmath06s , the end of its sharp radius contraction after @xmath018s , and final photospheric touchdown ( as defined by the simultaneous peak in @xmath17 and trough in @xmath18 ) after @xmath090s .",
    "for the 2000 burst these times are respectively 5.6s , 6.6s , and @xmath019s .",
    "the e - folding time for the decay of the 1988 burst is hard to determine from van paradijs et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , but they note that the burst intensity had decreased to 20% by 160s after burst onset . for the 2000 burst , the 20% mark",
    "is reached after 38s . largely due to this difference in timescales ,",
    "the total bolometric energy released by the bursts differs by a factor of 4 : 6.3@xmath110@xmath4 ergs for the 1988 event , as compared to 1.85@xmath110@xmath4 ergs for the 2000 event .",
    "although a little weaker than the first burst , the burst described here still ranks as an unusually energetic event .    from the fluxes",
    "derived earlier we calculate the burst characteristics @xmath28 ( = @xmath25/@xmath29 ) and @xmath30 ( = @xmath31/@xmath29 , where @xmath31 is the total burst fluence or integrated net flux across the burst ) to be 0.0125 and 125s respectively for the 1988 burst , and 0.0084 and 28.5s for the burst presented above . in their summary of the properties of eddington - limited bursts from a large number of sources , van paradijs ,",
    "penninx & lewin ( 1988 ) find a strong anti - correlation between log  @xmath30 and log  @xmath28 for type i bursts showing photospheric radius expansion .",
    "the  bursts lie on the line of this anti - correlation , but at the extreme end of the ( @xmath32 ) distribution , indicating the intensity and long duration of the bursts from  relative to those from other sources .      in figure",
    "4a we present the luminosity - temperature ( @xmath33-@xmath34 ) diagram for the 2000 burst , constructed using the parameters derived from the fits to the spectra out to 100s after the burst rise .",
    "the radius expansion and contraction phases are almost horizontal at a luminosity corresponding to the eddington limit , with a slope introduced by general relativistic effects .",
    "figure  4a can be directly compared to the equivalent diagram for the 1988 burst ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1990 , figure  9 ) ; in removing the time domain , this representation emphasises the similarity between the two bursts .",
    "figure  4b shows the strong inverse correlation between the apparent blackbody radius and temperature ; the track defined by the envelope contraction lies almost on top of the expansion track , indicating the reversibility of the thermodynamic processes involved . from first principles the luminosity , radius , and temperature of the photosphere",
    "should be related by the expression @xmath35 . in this case",
    "the luminosity is not quite constant , and the radius and temperature obey the relation @xmath36 , with @xmath37=2.06@xmath60.04 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "both diagrams show the radiative cooling curve of the neutron star surface after the touchdown of the photosphere .",
    "while a simple blackbody often provides reasonable fits to burst spectra from neutron stars , the energy distribution of the true emission is likely to be more complex .",
    "a systematic difference is expected between the blackbody color temperature @xmath34 ( = @xmath17 ) obtained from spectral fitting and the effective temperature @xmath19 , due to the dominant contribution of electron scattering in the hot neutron star atmosphere , and the resulting suppression of emissivity ( van paradijs 1982 ) .",
    "model atmosphere calculations show that the spectral hardening ratio @xmath38=@xmath39 is greater than 1 , and increases as a function of @xmath40 and of @xmath41=@xmath42 ( london et al .",
    "1984 , 1986 ; ebisuzaki & nomoto 1986 , 1988 ; titarchuk 1994 ; madej , 1997 ) .",
    "the neutron star radius observed by a distant observer , @xmath43 , is related to @xmath18 by @xmath44=@xmath45 .",
    "accurate knowledge of the behavior of @xmath38 would place direct constraints on the mass - radius relationship for neutron stars . however , there is as yet no convincing agreement between the various existing theoretical models , and in addition the model atmosphere calculations do not match the observed variations with luminosity in several sources , including x1608@xmath46522 ( penninx et al .",
    "1989 ) and  itself ( see below , and figure  5 ) .",
    "if we adopt a representative spectral hardening factor of @xmath38=1.5@xmath60.1 ( e.g. london et al .",
    "1984 , 1986 ; madej 1997 ) for illustrative purposes , our measured photospheric touchdown radius of @xmath18=8.6@xmath61.0  km would imply @xmath44=19.3@xmath63.4  km .",
    "the value of the eddington luminosity measured by a distant observer depends upon the mass and radius of the emitting object . in the limiting case ,",
    "the eddington luminosity measured at very large photospheric radii , @xmath47 , will be greater than the value measured at the point of photospheric touchdown , @xmath48 , by a factor equivalent to the gravitational redshift at the neutron star surface , @xmath49 ( paczyski & anderson 1986 ; damen et al .  1990 ) . at intermediate radii , the ratio of the eddington luminosities observed ( @xmath50 is a function of both the redshift and photospheric radius , as modified by the ( possibly varying ) spectral hardening ( damen et al.1990 ) .",
    "therefore , the photospheric expansion track allows us to directly estimate the gravitational redshift factor at the surface of the neutron star , if we account correctly for the finite size of the photosphere and for the temperature dependence of the scattering opacity mentioned above .    for each data point in the photospheric expansion track ( figure  4a ) , we applied eqns .",
    "79 of damen et al .",
    "( 1990 ) to obtain an instantaneous estimate of ( @xmath49 ) , and then took the mean of these derived values . for this calculation we adopted an eddington luminosity at touchdown of @xmath48=(5.08@xmath60.31)@xmath110@xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 and a temperature at touchdown of 2.70@xmath60.13  kev .",
    "model atmosphere calculations during the expansion phase of a burst have not yet been performed , so we calculated the redshift for two differing assumptions .",
    "first , we assumed that the spectral hardening ratio was constant during the expansion , and thus that no correction was required for non - planckian shape of the burst spectra .",
    "for this case , we obtained a value of @xmath49=1.17@xmath60.05 ( s.d . ) . in the second derivation we assumed ( again following damen et al.1990 ) that the dependence of @xmath38 on the observed color temperature @xmath51 is the same during radius expansion and contraction as it is during the neutron star cooling .",
    "we can not derive _ absolute _ values for @xmath38 from observational data alone ; we can , however , determine _ relative _ values , and this is all the method requires . during cooling ,",
    "the effective temperature @xmath52 is proportional to @xmath53 , and thus the hardening factor @xmath38 is proportional to @xmath54 ( penninx et al.1989 ; damen et al .",
    "1990 ) . in figure  5",
    "we show @xmath55 plotted against @xmath51 for the cooling track of our  burst , following photospheric touchdown . for temperatures",
    "@xmath56  kev , the relationship can be approximated with a straight - line fit . using this fit to scale the radius estimates that enter the redshift calculation ( damen et al .",
    "1990 , eqn .  9 )",
    ", our derived gravitational redshift factor becomes @xmath49=1.28@xmath60.06 ( s.d . ) .    applying the relativistic correction and solving for @xmath57 and mass ( e.g. lewin et al .",
    "1983 , van paradijs et al .",

    "we emphasise that although only statistical errors are quoted here , all current derivations of basic neutron star parameters from burst spectroscopy are affected by the systematic uncertainties in the interpretation of the spectral fit temperatures ( van paradijs et al.1990 , lewin et al .",

    "imply a possible variation in @xmath38 of @xmath050% over the temperature range 1.5@xmath632.7  kev which is not well reproduced in the model atmosphere calculations .",
    "the composition of the accreted matter , and degree of anisotropy in the burst radiation , are additional key unknowns limiting our ability to obtain the mass - radius relationship of the neutron star using these methods .",
