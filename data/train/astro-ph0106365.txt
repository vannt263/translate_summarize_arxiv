    "one of the basic characteristics of extensive air showers ( eas ) of superhigh energies , that can be measured quite accurately by large ground - based air shower arrays is charged particle local density at various distances from the core location .",
    "reliable theoretical predictions on the lateral distribution function ( ldf ) of different eas components in wide radial distance range are therefore of great importance in cosmic ray research for both physical interpretation of existing experimental data and new experiments design studies .",
    "unfortunately , the problem of fast , proper and at the same time adequate to numerous specific experimental conditions calculations of ldf at large distances from the shower core ( @xmath0  km ) is not solved yet .",
    "direct monte - carlo technique is of course preferable but takes unreasonably much computation time .",
    "one of widely used approaches implements an analytical description of electromagnetic subshowers , usually based on different well known modifications of nkg formula @xcite obtained for distances up to several hundreds meters from the core position . in this case",
    "formal extrapolation to @xmath1  km and farther is a source of mistakes .",
    "the weak point of hybrid methods is the necessity of complete recalculation of prerecorded libraries of subshowers in case of any changes in input assumptions .",
    "established thinning algorithms seem very promising , but still not sufficiently effective in case of very large radial distances , because small fraction of distant particles is tracked with very large weights @xcite .",
    "there are evidences [ see , for example , @xcite ] , that it is possible to improve statistical significance of thinning at large distances by artificial limiting the weight , which particle can obtain , but such technics are still in the stage of development .",
    "on the other hand , present situation concerning comparisons of lateral distributions measured by scintillation counters at akeno and yakutsk with each other as well as with theoretical predictions at ultrahigh energies ( @xmath2  ev ) remains mostly unsatisfactory .",
    "though in several recent publications [ see , for example , @xcite ] reasonable agreement between the shapes of experimental and calculational charged particle ldfs was achieved , the absolute values demonstrate significant discrepancies . as a consequence shifting theoretical densities vertically with a factor",
    "@xmath3 is now widespread technique utilized during comparisons of lateral distributions .",
    "furthermore latest theoretical studies @xcite indicate strong influence of the effect of scintillation detector response on the shape of ldf .",
    "it is also worth to mention peculiarities of lateral distributions of charged particles and muons at @xmath4  ev founded by yakutsk group , that have not been confirmed by other experiments at this moment and can not be explained by simulations without exotic physical assumptions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we check the validity of one - parametric scaling representation of lateral distribution of electrons established in our earlier works by comparison with agasa experimental data . in order to perform adequate comparisons with experiment recent corsika simulation results about contribution of low - energy muons and energy deposition in scintillation",
    "counters are used .",
    "we also examine here the possibility of utilizing the experimental data about the shape of charged particle ldf for cosmic ray primary composition deduction .",
    "according to scaling formalism @xcite , the lateral distribution of electrons in both gamma- and hadron - induced cascade showers can be represented in a form : @xmath5 here @xmath6   electron density at radial distance @xmath7 from the core in showers of primary energy @xmath8 at depth @xmath9 from primary particle injection point , @xmath10   total number of electrons at observation level , @xmath11   mean square radius ( the second moment of normalized electron ldf ) , which is defined  as @xmath12^{1/2}.\\label{rms_def}\\ ] ] function @xmath13 in formula  ( [ estim ] )  ( _ scaling function _ ) is normalized ldf with respect to variable @xmath14 .",
    "it does not depend practically on primary particle type , shower energy and age .",
    "besides it is not sensitive to variations of basic parameters of hadronic interaction model .",
    "finally we obtain the following formula for electron density @xcite : @xmath15 @xmath16 though the structure of function  ( [ ronew ] ) is similar to modified linsley function , which is traditionally used for fitting experimental ldf of charged particles measured by scintillation counters , the important difference is that function  ( [ ronew ] ) is one - parametric and scale - invariant .",
    "our latest results obtained for the mean square radius of electrons can be approximated as follows @xcite : @xmath17 @xmath18,~{\\rm m}.\\label{rms_app}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 is air density at depth @xmath9 , @xmath20 , @xmath21   depth of maximum of average cascade curve .",
    "approximation  ( [ rms_app ] ) gives one - valued relation between  @xmath22 and normalized average lateral distribution function of electrons .",
    "it is important that relation  ( [ rms_app ] ) is stable to variation of hadron - air inelastic cross section and inclusive spectra of secondaries remaining valid within the limits defined by widespread hadronic interaction models @xcite .",
    "ev proton - induced extensive air showers .",
    "function ( [ ronew ] ) is shown in comparison with corsika / qgsjet data @xcite , width=264 ]    on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we compare our scaling ldf of electrons with corsika / qgsjet predictions @xcite for @xmath23  ev proton - initiated extensive air showers .",
    "our results are presented by function  ( [ ronew ] ) with @xmath24 and @xmath25  m ( @xmath26 ) as qgsjet predicts for proton - induced showers of considered energy .",
    "it is seen , that function  ( [ ronew ] ) is steeper than corsika data .",
    "the difference becomes essential at  @xmath0  km and increases considerably when irregularities appear in corsika data due to the lack of distant particles caused by thin sampling .",
    "adequate comparisons of theoretical results with experimental lateral distributions of charged particles require to take into account the contribution of low - energy muons and also detector response effect .",
    "according to corsika simulations @xcite lateral distribution of muons changes its form sharply , when muon threshold energy decrease from 1  gev to 0.25  gev .",
    "about 10 - 15% additional increasing in muon densities without disturbing the shape of ldf was pointed out for threshold energy 10  mev . as a result coefficient @xmath27 in vertical showers increases from @xmath28 at 600  m to @xmath29 at 2000  m from the core making muon lateral distribution much flatter in comparison with ldf measured experimentally by muon detectors with high threshold energy .",
    "in several recent papers @xcite theoretical study of the influence of scintillation detector response on the shape of charged particle ldf has been made .",
    "the correction factor @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is scintillation yield in units of minimum ionizing particle ( _ scintillator density _ ) and @xmath32 is charged particle density itself , was investigated . while absolute values of @xmath33 calculated using different methods and simulation codes are different from each other , the main tendency in radial dependence is same .",
    "function @xmath34 increases distinctly from several tens to at least several hundreds meters from the core position .",
    "it means that utilizing a factor 1.1 of scintillator density to spark chamber density , which has been determined experimentally by agasa group within 100 m from the core @xcite , is not quite accurate for large distances . for our comparisons we implemented data @xcite , calculated by corsika for 5  cm plastic scintillator , according to which @xmath35 at @xmath36  m and @xmath37 at @xmath38  m. for very large distances ( @xmath0  km ) no changes in the shape of ldf due to scintillation detector response were assumed .",
    "formally , the relation between two experimentally observable characteristics @xmath31 and @xmath39 can be presented as follows : @xmath40 k_{\\rm sc}(r)}{k_{\\rm array}}.\\label{s(r)}\\ ] ] here @xmath41 is coefficient , which depends on single particle definition used in concrete experiment [ in case of agasa @xmath42 @xcite ] .",
    "since @xmath43 and @xmath34 are determined basically by low energetic part of a cascade , it is reasonable to expect that radial behaviour of both correction factors will not depend critically on features of hadronic interactions at very high energies , primary energy ( at least in a limited energy range ) and composition .",
    "this conclusion has been partially confirmed by theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "therefore we can use relation  ( [ s(r ) ] ) to estimate electron ldf from the experimental data . on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the result of such estimation of @xmath44 for vertical @xmath23  ev showers obtained from agasa data in comparison with our scaling distribution for proton primaries  ( same as on fig .  [ fig1 ] , except of normalizing constant ) .",
    "agasa empirical functions for @xmath31 and @xmath39 together with estimated @xmath45 are also shown .",
    "we utilized both logarithmic ( a ) and linear ( b ) radial distance scales to emphasize that our result is in very good agreement with the one estimated from agasa experimental data in whole radial distance range .",
    "the chemical composition of primary cosmic rays with @xmath2  ev is not measured well for today .",
    "the basic method used to deduce primary composition from experimental data of large ground - based air shower arrays is muon component analysis .",
    "though muon local density at fixed distance from the core position is rather sensitive to the type of primary particle ( including @xmath46-rays ) , the observable muons with @xmath47 are mostly derived from high energy interactions .",
    "thus the interpretation of experimental data on the basis of comparisons with theoretical results depends on hadronic interaction model used in calculations .",
    "this problem is still unsolved .      a key result , which allows us to consider the shape of lateral distribution function measured by scintillation counters as a source of information about primary composition of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays , is rather strong energy ( and consequently composition ) dependence of the shape of electron ldf .",
    "it is important that , as scaling property  ( [ estim ] ) shows , this dependence can be completely described by the variation of single parameter   mean square radius of electrons . according to our results @xcite",
    "the narrowing of electron ldf with energy is likely to be conserved at least up to @xmath48  ev , while the dependence on basic parameters of hadronic interaction model is relatively weak . on fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show mean square radius of electrons vs. primary energy for proton- and iron - initiated showers at agasa observation level ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the shaded areas represent uncertainties of the result among qgsjet ( top ) and sibyll ( bottom ) interaction models [ here we used approximation  ( [ rms_app ] ) with these models predictions for @xmath21 as reported in @xcite ] .",
    "unfortunately , the mean square radius itself can not be estimated directly from experimental data so far as it demands high precision measurements of lateral distribution of electron component in wide radial distance range ( from several meters to several thousands meters from the core ) .",
    "nevertheless , the change of slope of charged particle ldf around 600  m from the shower core reflects well the changes in electron lateral distribution , as experimental uncertainties in this region are relatively small and the contribution of muons with @xmath50 in vertical showers is about 10% at @xmath51  ev , decreasing with energy @xcite .",
    "we should point out that theoretical studies of both @xmath43 and @xmath52 are far from being complete up to now and also it is still difficult to finally exclude some exotic processes or new particles in eas of ultrahigh energies .",
    "furthermore , it is impossible to confirm or deny the presence of small fraction of @xmath46-induced showers from such kind of analysis .",
    "but the main disadvantage for making some conclusions about composition is controversial character of existing experimental data , obtained by agasa and yakutsk array .",
    "while energy independence of the shape of @xmath31 from @xmath53  ev up to highest observed energies reported by agasa group repeatedly [ see , for example , @xcite ] is an evidence for changing primary composition from relatively light to relatively heavy in this energy region , yakutsk data shows extremely sharp steepening of ldf around @xmath51  ev @xcite , which ( refusing extraordinary explanations ) leads to converse conclusion .",
    "nevertheless the weak sensitivity of the result to hadronic interaction model makes such kind of analysis interesting as another one source of information about primary composition , hopefully in nearest future with further accumulation of experimental data .",
    "we are grateful to k.shinozaki from saitama university for valuable discussions .",
    "one of the authors ( r.i.r . ) is greatly indebted to japan - russia youth exchange center ( jrex ) for support of his research work in japan in form of a fellowship .",
    "he also wishes to thank profs . a.misaki and n.inoue and all members of saitama university cosmic ray research group for the warm hospitality ."
