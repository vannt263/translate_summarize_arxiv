    "active galaxies and quasars are powered by physical processes in an accretion disk surrounding a massive black hole @xcite . the observed number of active galaxies increases towards high redshift @xmath0 , so that many ` normal ' galaxies must have been active in the past @xcite .",
    "this implies that inactive massive central black holes must lurk in the nuclei of nearby normal galaxies . in the past decade",
    ", much work has been done to measure the masses of these black holes , to establish the relation between black hole mass and the global / nuclear properties of the host galaxy , and to understand the role these objects play in driving internal dynamical evolution @xcite .",
    "a black hole of mass @xmath1 in a galactic nucleus dominates the gravitational potential inside the so - called radius of influence which is usually defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath4 is the characteristic velocity dispersion in the host galaxy . in physical units @xmath5 for a galaxy at distance @xmath6 , @xmath7 corresponds to an angular size @xmath8 inside the sphere of influence , the black hole generates a central cusp in the density distribution of the stars . the resulting density and luminosity @xmath9 with @xmath10 @xcite . the typical velocities scale @xmath11 with radius .    while many early - type galaxies have cusps in their central luminosity profiles",
    "@xcite , these by themselves are not proof of the presence of a black hole , as other processes can generate such cusps @xcite .",
    "for this reason most studies concentrate on obtaining spectroscopy at the smallest angular scales , to find evidence for the expected keplerian rise in the velocities of stars and gas .",
    "this requires high spatial resolution .",
    "for example , the @xmath12 black hole in the nucleus of the galaxy m87 @xcite in the virgo cluster has @xmath13 .",
    "the general approach is to determine the _ luminous _ mass in stars from the observed surface brightness distribution , and to compare this with the _ dynamical _ mass derived from kinematic measurements of stars or gas @xcite . if one can show that the mass density inside a certain radius is larger than anything that can be produced by normal dynamical processes , then the object is considered to be a black hole . in a few cases it is possible to find direct evidence for the presence of a relativistic object (  [ sec : gas ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : rix ] shows @xmath7 as defined in eq.([eq : one ] ) for the best published black hole mass determinations versus the distance to the host galaxy .",
    "lines of constant angular resolution @xmath14 run diagonal .",
    "the early determinations clustered near @xmath15 @xcite , but hst has pushed this to @xmath16 .",
    "detailed modeling has shown that , depending on the internal dynamical structure of the host galaxy , the effects of the black hole often are visible only inside projected radii that are significantly smaller than @xmath7 ( e.g. , eq .  ( 4.2 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that measured masses corresponding to @xmath17 should be treated with caution , as they are likely to be overestimates ( see  [ sec : demo ] ) . at present",
    ", only vlbi measurements can probe the regime @xmath18 .",
    "the nearest galactic nucleus is the center of our own galaxy . despite the large foreground extinction , it is possible to resolve individual stars in the galactic center in the infrared , and to measure not only their radial velocities , but also their proper motions @xcite , and accelerations @xcite !",
    "dynamical modeling of this remarkable data provides unequivocal proof that our galaxy contains a central black hole of nearly three million solar masses .",
    "the dynamics of the nuclei of nearby early - type galaxies can be probed with stellar absorption - line spectroscopy of the integrated light .",
    "this generally requires long exposure times .",
    "the orbital structure in these systems is rich @xcite , so a true inward increase of the mass - to - light ratio @xmath19 must be distinguished from radial variation of the velocity anisotropy .",
    "this can be done by measuring the shape of the line - of - sight velocity distribution @xcite .",
    "the orbital structure is related to the intrinsic shape of the galaxy .",
    "this can be constrained by measurements along multiple position angles @xcite , or , even better , by integral - field spectroscopy (  [ sec : next ] ) .",
    "determination of the black hole mass and the orbital structure requires construction of dynamical models .",
    "there has been a steady increase in the sophistication of model construction in the past decade .",
    "early isotropic spherical models were replaced by anisotropic spheres , and then by axisymmetric models with a special orbital structure ( phase - space distribution function @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the orbital energy and @xmath22 is the angular momentum component parallel to the symmetry axis , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more recently axisymmetric models with the full range of possible anisotropies , and multiple components have been used .",
    "the first such study was done for m32 , and included ground - based data along four position angles and eight fos pointings @xcite .",
    "the model was constructed by a version of schwarzschild s @xcite numerical orbit - superposition method , which fits the surface brightness distribution as well as all kinematic observables @xcite .",
    "another example of this approach is provided by the e7/s0 galaxy ngc 4342 in virgo .",
    "this is a low - luminosity object , seen nearly edge - on , with a prominent nuclear stellar disk .",
    "cretton & van den bosch @xcite used ground - based major - axis kinematics from the wht and five fos pointings @xcite , and compared these with general axisymmetric models containing a spheroid , a stellar disk , a nuclear disk and a black hole .",
    "free parameters in the modeling were @xmath1 and the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath23 .",
    "contours of constant @xmath24 in the @xmath25-plane show that the best fit is obtained for @xmath26 , but with a significant uncertainty ( figure  [ fig : n4342 ] ) .    to date , black hole masses have been derived in this way for about fifteen objects .",

    "black hole masses based on three - integral axisymmetric modeling of stis absorption - line spectroscopy have been reported for a dozen objects by gebhardt s group @xcite , but the data and the models have not yet been published .    while in some cases axisymmetric models are consistent with the data , in others they clearly are inadequate (  [ sec : next ] ) .",
    "the nucleus of m31 has been known to be asymmetric since 1974 @xcite .",
    "observations with the integral - field spectrograph tiger revealed that the black hole resides in the secondary peak in the brightness distribution @xcite , and led to models with an asymmetric distribution of stars @xcite .",
    "measurements with oasis on the cfht @xcite have shown that hst spectroscopy with foc @xcite , fos and stis along the apparent symmetry axis of the eccentric structure has in fact missed the kinematic major axis .",
    "a comprehensive non - axisymmetric model that fits this data will teach us much about the structure and formation of this nearby nucleus.=-2    some nearby galactic nuclei are shrouded in dust , and their internal kinematics is best probed at longer wavelengths .",
    "this is now possible through the availability of near - ir spectrographs , which employ the co bandhead at 2.3@xmath27 to derive the stellar kinematics .",
    "anders @xcite used the mpe - built 3d integral - field unit to show that the derived nuclear kinematics in the largely dust - free nearby galaxy ngc 3115 agrees with the kinematics measured at shorter wavelengths @xcite , demonstrating that this approach works .",

    "high spatial resolution emission - line kinematics ( foc , fos and stis ) , together with careful modeling , has been published for six cases : m87 , ngc 4261 , ngc 4374 , ngc 6251 , ngc 7052 , ic 1459 @xcite . these very luminous early - type galaxies cover a modest range in total luminosity , but the derived black hole masses vary by a factor of ten .",

    "for the past five years , our understanding of black hole demography was summarized in a diagram of black hole mass @xmath1 versus absolute bulge luminosity @xmath42 , where the ` bulge ' was taken to be the entire galaxy for an elliptical or lenticular , or the actual bulge in case of a spiral @xcite .",
    "early work based on simple axisymmetric jeans models and ground - based kinematics @xcite was interpreted as evidence for a tight correlation of @xmath1 with @xmath42 , and hence with the total mass of the bulge .",
    "much effort was spent in trying to reproduce this correlation in models of galaxy formation , and in relating it to the energy production in quasars @xcite .",
    "more appropriate dynamical models combined with hst kinematics have generally resulted in a downward revision of the earlier masses @xcite .",

    "the masses are consistent with various black hole formation scenarios @xcite , and they agree with the quasar light prediction for reasonable efficiencies @xcite .",
    "however , there is an observational bias against detecting small black holes in large galaxies , i.e. , for cases where the radius of influence is simply smaller than the spatial resolution currently achievable .",
    "absolute galaxy luminosity correlates with velocity dispersion @xcite , so @xmath1 is expected to correlate with @xmath4 , measured outside the radius of influence of the black hole .",

    "a good fit is provided by @xmath44 , where @xmath4 is the velocity dispersion at @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the effective radius @xcite .",
    "this suggests yet another link between global and nuclear galaxy properties , but it is not understood what causes this link , or whether there are other parameters involved .",

    "for this reason , the dynamics groups of the universities at lyon , leiden , and durham have built the special - purpose integral - field spectrograph sauron for the wht , with high throughput , and a field of view of @xmath52 sampled at @xmath53 @xcite , and are using it to observe a representative sample of 80 nearby early - type galaxies .",

    ". it will be interesting to probe this galaxy at even higher spatial resolution , to establish whether the nucleus is axisymmetric and the derived black hole mass correct , or whether the non - axisymmetry persists , and our understanding of the nuclear dynamics needs modification .",
    "either way , the codes for numerical model construction need to be generalized to triaxial geometry , and to asymmetric systems such as the nucleus of m31 .",
    "the ongoing systematic programs will reveal the black hole demographics as a function of hubble type , radio properties , intrinsic shapes , and internal dynamics .",
