    "magnetic flux tubes are basic structural features in astrophysical magnetic fields like the sun s atmosphere , or may represent the toroidal magnetic field in thermonuclear confinement devices such as tokamaks @xcite . within a single flux tube , the magnetic sub - structure may be extremely complex , particularly when the plasma undergoes a turbulent evolution .",
    "a useful technique for characterizing the magnetic field in such a tube is the field line mapping from one end to the other ( defined in ) .",
    "this reduces the field to a two - dimensional function that is simpler to analyze , yet retains much important information .",
    "field line mappings have been used in solar physics , where strong mapping gradients are a likely indicator for preferred locations of magnetic reconnection @xcite , and to model laboratory devices with toroidal geometry @xcite .",
    "the latter have exploited the mathematical interpretation of a flux tube as a dynamical system in two space dimensions , with the role of `` time '' played by the direction along the tube .",
    "powerful techniques from dynamical systems theory may thus be applied to study the three - dimensional magnetic structure at a given time snapshot . in this paper , we show how a basic topological property of the field line mapping ",
    "the fixed point index  may lead to a physical constraint on the _ time evolution _ of a magnetic flux tube .",
    "this topological constraint applies under any evolution where field lines on the side boundary of the flux tube ( which is by definition a magnetic surface ) undergo an ideal evolution that preserves their connectivity @xcite . essentially , the interior dynamics are restricted because the total index of interior fixed points is determined by that of fixed points on the boundary ( ) .",
    "the constraint does not depend on the nature of the dynamics in the tube , which may follow the equations of ideal - magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , resistive mhd , or any other continuous evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "however , the work was initially motivated by resistive - mhd simulations of magnetic loops in the solar corona ( atmosphere ) .",
    "the coronal magnetic field builds up stress and energy as it is twisted by motion of its footpoints in the solar interior .",
    "the key question is : what will be the final state of its subsequent turbulent relaxation ?",
    "knowing the appropriate constraints that apply during this relaxation would allow us to predict the final state , and hence place limits on the amount of magnetic energy that can be dissipated during the relaxation .",
    "this has direct implications for understanding how the magnetic field heats the corona to extreme temperatures @xcite .",
    "the appropriate constraints for a resistive - mhd relaxation remain under debate @xcite .",
    "the theory of taylor @xcite , which predicts relaxation to a so - called linear force - free field , can explain the final state in certain laboratory experiments , and has been conjectured to apply to the solar corona @xcite . however , its applicability to astrophysical magnetic fields like the corona is unclear , with recent numerical simulations of a solar coronal loop @xcite finding a final state in conflict with expectations from taylor theory .",
    "shows one of these simulations , which we refer to as the `` braided magnetic field '' ( due to the initial structure ) and use as an illustrative example throughout this paper .",
    "we have recently shown that the index constraint can explain why these simulations are unable to reach the predicted taylor state @xcite .    in this paper , we develop fully the initial idea of @xcite for a general flux tube , explicitly accounting for the ( important ) influence of the side boundary and exploring the role of higher periodic points . the latter are fixed points of _ iterations _ of the field line mapping . to allow for these ,",
    "we focus on a flux tube with periodic boundary conditions ( i.e. , the distribution of the normal magnetic field is the same across both ends of the flux tube ) . in that case",
    ", the tube end is a poincar section in the dynamical system analogy , and the field line mapping is a return map .",
    "periodicity is natural if the cylinder represents a toroidal geometry , but is also typical in numerical simulations of solar coronal magnetic loops where the initial conditions are given by an analytical equilibrium and the ends remain `` line - tied '' throughout the evolution .",
    "in fact , we find that in most cases the higher periodic points do not impose any additional constraint on the dynamics .",
    "this result is formulated in theorem [ prop : main ] and proved in .",
    "on a cylinder of radius @xmath0.,scaledwidth=20.0% ]    [ fig : tube ]    we shall consider magnetic fields @xmath1 on the cylinder @xmath2 , sketched in .",
    "the lower and upper boundary discs are denoted @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "we impose the following conditions : @xmath5 in sections [ sec : fixed ] and [ sec : periodic ] we will consider time - dependent magnetic fields @xmath6 , and these conditions will be applied at all times . in particular , allows the magnetic field on @xmath3 or @xmath4 to be time - dependent , providing that @xmath7 remains periodic .",
    "static `` line - tying '' is a special case .",
    "since @xmath8 , the magnetic flux is the same through any horizontal cross - section of the cylinder , which therefore represents a magnetic flux tube . moreover ,",
    "all magnetic field lines ( integral curves of @xmath9 ) connect @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the same direction , and can be parametrized using the coordinate @xmath10 .",
    "the field line starting at @xmath11 is denoted @xmath12 and found by integrating @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "tracing field lines from every @xmath17 yields a mapping @xmath18 given by @xmath19 called the _ field line mapping _ of @xmath9 . since we are interested in physical magnetic fields with finite dissipation , we assume that @xmath9 is differentiable , and hence that @xmath20 is a diffeomorphism of the disc to itself .",
    "it follows from the fact that @xmath20 is a homeomorphism that the boundary circle @xmath21 is mapped to itself .    from @xmath8",
    ", it may be shown that the jacobian determinant of @xmath20 is @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "condition then implies that @xmath24 , so the mapping is orientation - preserving . in those fields where @xmath25 for every field line , @xmath20 is also area - preserving .",
    "such symplectic maps have been widely studied as models for magnetic fields in the fusion context @xcite , but a general field line mapping is only symplectic when written in appropriate canonical coordinates @xcite .",
    "although most of our examples do retain this property in physical coordinates , the results in this paper do not depend on it , requiring only conditions - .",
    "to analyse the local behaviour of the field line mapping @xmath20 we introduce , on the disc @xmath4 , the mapping @xmath26 although @xmath27 is not a proper vector field , we can treat it like one for the purposes of this paper .",
    "the main use of @xmath27 will be to define the fixed point index , but we note first that it leads to a simple but effective `` colour map '' technique for visualising the 2-d mapping @xmath20 @xcite . in cartesian",

    "indeed , the colour map was introduced to aid the numerical search for fixed points @xcite .",
    "the uniform twist field has a single fixed point at the origin @xmath38 , while the braided magnetic field has multiple fixed points at different times .",
    "the reason for focusing on fixed points of @xmath20 is simple : they are _ topological _ properties of the mapping , and hence of @xmath9 . in an ideal time evolution ,",
    "the fixed points are invariants .",
    "but even under a non - ideal evolution they can not be arbitrarily created or destroyed .",
    "importantly , we can make a stronger statement not just about the fixed points in isolation but about the local structure of the mapping around them .",
    "this is expressed through a topological property called the ( poincar/-hopf ) _ index _ of each fixed point .",
    "the index of a fixed point of @xmath20 depends on the local mapping around the fixed point , so to assign an index to fixed points lying on the boundary @xmath21 , the mapping @xmath20 must be extended outside the disc @xmath39 . to this end , following @xcite , define the extended mapping @xmath40 which is continuous and introduces no additional fixed points .",

    "let @xmath41 be a closed curve enclosing an isolated fixed point @xmath11 but enclosing no other fixed point .",
    "the _ index _ of @xmath17 , denoted @xmath42 , is the winding number of the closed curve @xmath43 about the origin @xcite .",

    "the bottom row of shows that this topological property persists throughout the dynamical evolution , verifying that both @xmath170 and @xmath171 are conserved , acting as dynamical constraints .",
    "the simulation is imperfect in that the cylindrical flux tube boundary does not remain perfectly ideal , due to the finite numerical dissipation and to the fact that it does not coincide with the computational boundary .",
    "thus the period 2 points on the flux tube boundary move slightly between the initial and final states . nevertheless , it remains sufficiently close to ideal to illustrate the topological constraints .     in ( a ) the initial state and ( b ) the final state of the new simulation described in .",
    "this is a magnetic field with two independent dynamical constraints . outside the flux tube @xmath166",

    "this relies on the boundary condition , and on the property that @xmath20 maps the boundary @xmath21 to itself . without loss of generality we work in cartesian coordinates @xmath172 where the @xmath173-axis corresponds to @xmath21 and the upper half of the @xmath174-plane to the interior of @xmath3 .",
    "the fixed point is at @xmath175 .",
    "let @xmath176 be the local linearisation of @xmath27 about the fixed point , so that @xmath177 , where the matrix @xmath178 is given by @xmath179    we start by noting that , since @xmath20 maps the boundary @xmath180 to itself , @xmath181 must be an eigenvector of @xmath178 .",

    "this rules out the possibility of a `` semi - node '' on the boundary ( ) . there remain two types of generic boundary fixed point : both `` semi - saddles '' but differing in the sign of @xmath184 .",
