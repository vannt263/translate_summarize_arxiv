    "the known high-@xmath9 quasars are extremely luminous objects capable of lighting up any gas or dust in their vicinity out to several hundred kiloparsecs by direct ionization , and by scattering in  and continuum light . at redshifts",
    "@xmath10 , when the age of the universe was @xmath11 billion years , the available time is comparable with the dynamical timescales of galactic halos and any infalling gas within a quasar host galaxy should be illuminated by the central source ( @xcite ) . a number of  searches around high - redshift quasars have succeeded in identifying  emitters at the redshift of the quasar and within a small angular separation from the quasar ( , @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest explanation for the -emitting gas seen around these systems is that it is due to ionization of the gas in nearby , possibly interacting , galaxies or gas clouds by the quasar ( @xcite ) .",
    "even very small column densities of gas or dust ( , as little as @xmath12 @xmath2 in neutral hydrogen ) can result in significant scattering or reprocessing .",
    "in the present letter we describe the discovery of a very high redshift emission companion to the @xmath0 quasar br12020725 , designated here as br12020725@xmath13 , which is detected in deep narrow - band images centered on the quasar s  emission , at a position @xmath14 northwest of the quasar . at @xmath15",
    ", @xmath16 corresponds to @xmath17 kpc for = 0.5 ( or @xmath18 kpc for = 0.1 ) , so @xmath19 corresponds to a projected separation of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) kpc .",
    "the object is also seen in an @xmath4 @xmath22 band continuum exposure ( f814w ) , with a centroid slightly offset from the emission , and has been studied in several colors by dodorico  ( 1995 ) , who argued based on the optical colors , with additional evidence from near - ir magnitude measurements by djorgovski ( 1995 ) , that this object is at @xmath23 , but identify it with the @xmath24 damped  system discovered by storrie - lombardi  ( 1995 ) rather than with the quasar itself .",
    "the present data suggest that the continuum object is at the redshift of the quasar rather than at the redshift of the foreground damped  system .",
    "the qso br12020725 was discovered in the apm bri survey for @xmath23 qsos ( @xcite ) . as part of a program to search for high-@xmath9 objects in the fields of @xmath23 quasars ,",
    "we have obtained a number of exposures through a narrow - band filter centered on the quasar s redshifted  emission ( central wavelength 6925 , 80  bandpass ) and through @xmath25 , @xmath22 , @xmath26 multi - color imaging with a tektronix 2048@xmath27 camera at optical wavelengths and the nicmos3 ( @xmath28 ) and quirc ( @xmath29 ) cameras at near - infrared wavelengths filter , which has a central wavelength of 2.1 @xmath30 m , in order to suppress the thermal component of background .",
    "we will refer to @xmath26 and @xmath31 interchangeably here ; the detailed photometric conversion is given in wainscoat & cowie ( 1992 ) . ] .",
    "the optical data were taken as a series of sky noise - limited integrations , each with an exposure time of 30 minutes ( in the case of the narrow - band exposures ) , with an offset step of @xmath32 between successive frames , and a median sky flat was generated from the on - field exposures for each night , while the ir data followed standard deep ir imaging procedures ( , @xcite ) .",
    "the optical data were taken on the uh 2.2 m on the nights of ( ut ) 57 march 1994 , 78 april 1994 , and 2930 march 1995 , while the ir data were taken on 1618 april 1994 ( nicmos3 ) and on 1820 march 1995 ( quirc ) using the uh 2.2 m. the total exposure time was 8 hrs in , 4.2 hrs in @xmath25 , 5.25 hrs in @xmath22 , 1.5 hrs in @xmath33 ( 8340/895 ) , and 17 hrs in @xmath31 .",
    "the broad - band data were calibrated using landolt standards ( @xcite ) and stars drawn from both the ukirt faint standards ( @xcite ) and elias standards ( @xcite ) in observations both before and after the target exposures .",
    "the narrow - band exposures were calibrated using feige 34 and bd+33 2642 .",
    "in addition , a relative calibration check with landolt standard - calibrated continuum exposures taken in an 895  line - free band centered at 8340  was also used to verify estimates of the  and continuum flux .",
    "a series of @xmath4 exposures were obtained on 2526 july 1995 using wfpc2 and the f814w filter .",
    "the f814w filter has an effective central wavelength of @xmath347900  and a effective width of @xmath341450 , sampling the spectral range 1260  to 1514  in the rest frame of the qso ( a region free of strong lines such as  and ) .",
    "@xmath4 exposures were taken as a sequence of eight exposures , with the two initial exposures each being 1000 s long and the subsequent six exposures each 1200 s in duration , over four primary orbits for a total of 9200 s. object magnitudes on the @xmath4 f814w data were obtained using the photflam calibrated fluxes over a @xmath35 diameter aperture and converted to a kron - cousins @xmath22 band magnitude following cowie , hu , & songaila ( 1995 ) .    the  image of the quasar shows a substantial extension to the northwest of the quasar and centered at a radial separation of @xmath19 . in figure 1 ( left panel )",
    "we show a sharpened version of this image which was deconvolved using maximum entropy from typical fwhm of @xmath36 on individual exposures to a fwhm of @xmath37 with the point spread function taken from the star which can be seen in the upper north west corner of the image .",
    "the @xmath4 @xmath22-band image shows a linear galaxy , extended towards the quasar , also lying at this position , though on the westward side of the  emission ( fig .  1 ; right panel )",
    "this slight displacement ( @xmath38 in the east - west direction ) appears to be real .",
    "the continuum object agrees in position with the object detected by dodorico  ( 1995 ) using the eso ntt . subtracting the continuum we find a  flux of @xmath1  for the companion , and an @xmath22 ( kron - cousins ) = @xmath39 for the associated continuum object .",
    "the emission is comparable to the measured fluxes found for other quasar  companions ( , @xcite ) , which are typically a few times @xmath40 , and the continuum magnitude is in good agreement with dodorico  ( 1995 ) , who find @xmath41= ( @xmath42 , 26.5 , 24.3 , 24.1 ) .",
    "our @xmath31 band observations shown in fig .  2 also show an extension to the northwest of the quasar .",
    "( there are hints in both the @xmath4 and @xmath31 data of further emission extending in a line to larger radii . )  measuring in a @xmath16 diameter aperture centered on the @xmath22 band object we find @xmath43 when the underlying quasar contribution is subtracted , while lu  ( 1996 ) quote a @xmath26 magnitude of @xmath44 based on djorgovski s ( 1995 ) observations .",
    "dodorico  point out that the sharp break in the optical implies that the object is at high redshift ( @xmath45 ) , consistent with its identification as a quasar companion .",
    "the combined sed is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 where it is compared with the spectrum of the quasar itself , showing that the photometry on the companion is consistent with its lying at the quasar redshift .",
    "the association of the continuum object with the quasar  strongly suggests that it is _ not _ associated with the damped  system at @xmath24 as dodorico  and lu  ( 1996 ) have recently suggested .",
    "a second galaxy lying about @xmath46 to the sw of the quasar with a slightly fainter @xmath22 magnitude ( 24.5 ) may represent an alternative candidate , since we do not see any strong  emission at the quasar redshift associated with this object .",
    "the present results indicate that some caution must be applied to identifying objects in close proximity to high - redshift quasars with foreground absorption systems .",
    "steidel , sargent , & dickinson ( 1991 ) and aragn - salamanca ( 1995 ) have serendipitously discovered -emitting companions to @xmath47 qsos when attempting to identify foreground absorbers . at high redshift",
    "the difference in distance modulus between the background qso and an intervening absorber is much less than for a typical case at low redshift , so that any faint object lying in the vicinity of a qso may be as likely to be associated with the qso as with the absorption - line system .",
    "the discovery of a  companion near br12020725 indicates that it is fruitful to search for such objects at optical wavelengths .",
    "more precise information on the nature of this object will require spectroscopic data at ir and optical wavelengths , which will also provide physical diagnostics on the emission system , to distinguish between agn - like or quasar - excitation mechanisms and to supply additional information on the nature of this system .",
    "since the rest - frame @xmath25 magnitude is roughly coincident with the observed @xmath26 magnitude we may directly obtain the rest - frame absolute @xmath25 magnitude ( @xmath48 ) as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the distance modulus and the last term is the k correction . for = 0.5 and",
    "= @xmath51 mpc@xmath3 we find @xmath52 or only about @xmath53 of the local  ( @xcite ) , so the galaxy is roughly comparable to an  galaxy . as can be seen from fig .",
    "3 its sed is similar to that of the quasar but it contains only about 0.1% of the quasar light .",
    "the observed equivalent width of the  is about 450 , corresponding to a rest - frame value of 80  .",
    "this would be consistent with excitation by the underlying population ( @xcite ) but given the apparently more extended nature of the ionized gas , its slight displacement from the continuum centroid , and its proximity to the much more luminous quasar , it is more probable that the quasar is the primary ionizing source .",
    "the ionized gas covers a sufficiently large fraction of the surface surrounding the quasar so that only a very small fraction of the ionizing flux passing through it needs to be absorbed and reradiated to produce the observed  emission ( @xcite ) . however , pahre & djorgovski ( 1995 ) , who have performed targeted ir narrow - band searches around br12020725 in the  line using nirc at keck ( with three other fields studied in  or ) , saw no evidence for extended emission near the quasar down to fluxes of @xmath54 , giving /@xmath55 .",
    "this would require that there is very little extinction of the  photons if metallicities were near solar , but it is likely that the metallicities are much lower in these early objects .",
    "the proximity of the quasar ( separation @xmath56 with typical seeing fwhm @xmath57 in the pahre & djorgovski observations ) may also imply that somewhat higher flux limits on  ( , by roughly a factor of two ) are appropriate at the position of br12020725@xmath13 .",
    "if the observed emission were due to photoionization by stars , with little attenuation by dust , then the luminosity in the line of @xmath58 ergs ( = 0.5 ) corresponds to a star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath59  yr@xmath3 , where we use kennicutt s ( 1983 ) relation between  luminosity and sfr=@xmath60)@xmath61 ergs s@xmath3  yr@xmath3 , and assume /=8.7 for case b recombination ( , @xcite ) .",
    "close  companions to the high-@xmath9 quasars are only infrequently seen at these fluxes ( about 15% of the cases in @xcite , all of which were around radio - loud quasars , where they were detected in roughly a third of the cases , and generally at lower flux levels ) and this is also true of the @xmath62 quasars , where br12020725 is the only one of five radio - quiet cases where we see such emission .",
    "they may represent cases where a neighboring gas cloud or galaxy ( as might be the case here ) is interacting and merging with the underlying quasar host producing enough extended gas to form a significant  companion when ionized by the quasar .    finally , it is notable that br12020725 has been detected at mm wavelengths ( @xcite ) .",
    "this radiation is consistent with thermal emission from  dust analogous to that detected by @xmath63 in nearby star - forming galaxies , and this would also be consistent with dust originating in an interaction with the quasar .",
