    "the well known topological insulator material bi@xmath4te@xmath5 has a layered structure with five atomic layers ( te - bi - te - bi - te ) as a quintuple layer ( ql ) unit@xcite .",
    "bitei has a similar layered structure with three atomic layers ( te - bi - i ) as a triple layer ( tl ) unit@xcite .",
    "the interactions between qls ( or tls ) are of weak van - der - waals ( vdw ) type , while the interactions within one ql ( or tl ) are of strong covalent or ionic type .",
    "since in - plane lattice constants of bi@xmath4te@xmath5 ( 4.383   ) and bitei ( 4.339   ) are very close , their heterostructure [ ( bitei)@xmath6(bi@xmath4te@xmath5)@xmath7 , which consists of alternating @xmath8 tls of bitei and @xmath9 qls of bi@xmath12te@xmath13 , is possible to be epitaxially grown along the crystallographic @xmath14-axis@xcite . the simplest structure [ ( bitei)@xmath15(bi@xmath12te@xmath13)@xmath11 ( hereafter referred to as bi@xmath13te@xmath16i ) is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . in the following ,",
    "we shall choose it as a representative example for the discussion of general structural and electronic properties of this family of heterostructures .",
    "the optimized lattice parameters and bond lengths without and with vdw corrections are listed in table.i . as can be seen from the table , the inter - layer bond lengths ( i - te@xmath15 and te@xmath5-te@xmath17 ) are much larger than the intra - layer bond lengths in both cases . with vdw correction ,",
    "the intra - layer bond lengths are hardly changed , while the inter - layer bond lengths are significantly reduced , confirming that the interactions between tl and its adjacent qls are of weak and non - local vdw type .",
    "the te@xmath5-te@xmath17 and i - te@xmath15 bond lengths relaxed by vdw - df method are similar to the inter - layer te - te bond length in bi@xmath4te@xmath5 ( 3.748   ) and the i - te bond length in bitei ( 3.924   ) respectively , which is reasonable . the dynamic stability of the structure is further investigated through the phonon spectrum calculations . the calculated phonon spectrum with soc is shown in fig .",
    "the absence of imaginary frequencies demonstrates that our structure of bi@xmath5te@xmath17i is dynamically stable . in the following electronic calculations , the optimized structure with vdw corrections",
    "is adopted .",
    "the calculated band structure of bi@xmath5te@xmath17i without soc is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) . as we can see , bi@xmath5te@xmath17i is a direct band gap semiconductor with e@xmath18 0.52 ev , much smaller than that of bitei ( @xmath19 1.2 ev)@xcite .",
    "the direct band gap is located at a - point of the brillouin zone ( labeled in fig .",
    "the states near the band edges are dominated by bi-6@xmath20 orbitals for the conduction band bottom , and by te-5@xmath20 orbitals for the valence band top .    when soc is turned on , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the energy bands are spin - splitted and at the same time the conduction band ( local ) minima are shifted away from the high symmetry points @xmath21 and a , which is similar to the case of bulk bitei .",
    "this is the signature of a rashba type spin splitting@xcite .",
    "the rss is characterized by the rashba energy @xmath22 , the momentum offset @xmath23 and the rashba coupling parameter @xmath24 .",
    "these parameters are illustrated in fig .",
    "2(c ) for the conduction band bottom near @xmath21 point .",
    "the rss at @xmath21 point is slightly anisotropic . along @xmath21-k direction , we have @xmath25 mev and @xmath26 ev@xmath27 , while along the @xmath21-m direction , the corresponding values are smaller , with @xmath28 mev and @xmath29 ev@xmath27 .",
    "the rss of conduction band near a point has a slightly smaller rashba energy ( @xmath30 mev ) , but the value of @xmath31 ( @xmath19 2.51 ev@xmath27 ) is close to that of the @xmath21 point .",
    "the value of rss in the heterostructure bi@xmath5te@xmath17i is much larger than the rss of conventional semiconductor heterostructures ( on the order of mev ) .",
    "this giant rss can be viewed as being inherited from the bitei component , which in its bulk form has a rss of @xmath32 mev ( @xmath33 ev@xmath27)@xcite .",
    "in addition to rss , the band order is also inverted after the introduction of soc . in the presence of soc , spin and orbital angular momentum are mixed and the @xmath34 states are transformed into @xmath35 states . as a consequence , the conduction band bottom , which is mainly occupied by the bi-@xmath34 orbital , is pushed downward .",
    "meanwhile the valence band top , which is occupied by the te-@xmath34 orbital , is pushed upward . due to the large atomic soc from bi and te",
    ", the energy gap around a point is inverted . to facilitate our understanding of this band inversion process , we gradually increase the strength of soc ( @xmath36 ) from zero to its full value , and monitor the evolution of the band structure . the local band gap at @xmath37=0.5 plane ( around a points ) and at @xmath37=0.0 plane ( around @xmath21 point ) is plotted in fig .",
    "2(d ) . as @xmath36 increases",
    ", the local gap around @xmath21 points decreases from 0.85 ev to 0.12 ev without closing .",
    "in contrast , the local gap around a points decreases , closes , reopens , and finally reaches a value of 0.22 ev . this band inversion induced by soc signals a topological phase transition in the current system .    to pin down the topological phase of the heterostructure",
    "more precisely , we calculate the topological @xmath2 invariants .",
    "since the inversion symmetry is explicitly broken in bi@xmath1te@xmath38i , the parity criterion can not apply@xcite .",
    "instead , we evaluate the @xmath2 invariants @xmath39 in terms of the berry gauge potential and berry curvature by using our recently developed general method within the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave framework@xcite .",
    "the calculated @xmath40 for bi@xmath5te@xmath17i is consistent with the previous band inversion analysis . at first sight",
    ", this topological insulating phase seems to be inherited from the bi@xmath4te@xmath5 component .",
    "however , it should be noted that the @xmath2 invariants of bi@xmath5te@xmath17i is different from that of bi@xmath4te@xmath5 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "instead it is more like bulk bitei under pressure@xcite , which has the same topological invariants .",
    "the difference in the index @xmath42 reflects the different band inversion point in the brillouin zone . for bi@xmath4te@xmath5 ,",
    "band inversion occurs at @xmath21 point , while for bi@xmath5te@xmath17i band inversion occurs at a point .",
    "the nonzero value of @xmath43 can have interesting physical consequences .",
    "for example , it has been shown that a system with @xmath44 may offer a topologically protected one - dimensional conducting channel along the @xmath14-axis@xcite .",
    "the nontrivial @xmath10 value is tied to the existence of tss@xcite . as another verification",
    ", we calculate the surface energy spectrum directly .",
    "2(e ) shows the local density of states ( ldos ) of a side - cut surface ( the @xmath45 plane of bi@xmath5te@xmath17i ) .",
    "a dirac cone in the bulk energy gap can be clearly seen , which is located at @xmath46 point of the projected two - dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "this again confirms the topological insulating phase of bi@xmath5te@xmath17i .",
    "thus far , we have shown that the simplest heterostructure bi@xmath5te@xmath17i was a strong topological insulator with giant bulk rss .",
    "now we extend our investigation to the family of heterostructures [ ( bitei)@xmath6(bi@xmath4te@xmath5)@xmath7 with different number of layers @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and see how the topological invariants and the rss depend on the layer configuration .",
    "the calculated results are summarized in table.ii .",
    "we observe that the coexistence of strong topological insulating phase and giant bulk rss is common to all these heterostructures .",
    "quite interestingly , the @xmath42 index of @xmath10 has a dependence on the parity of @xmath8 . namely @xmath47 when @xmath8 is odd and @xmath48 when @xmath8 is even . for odd @xmath8 ,",
    "band inversion occurs at a point , while for even @xmath8 , it occurs at @xmath21 point .",
    "the location of the surface dirac cone is associated with the band inversion point , hence can also be controlled by the parity of @xmath8 .",
    "( note that this is meaningful for side surfaces where the projections of a and @xmath21 are distinguishable . ) from the results , we see that the rashba energy is also tunable to a great extent by varying @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath22 generally increases with larger @xmath8 and smaller @xmath9 .",
    "it should be noted that heterostructures [ ( bitei)@xmath4(bi@xmath4te@xmath5)@xmath11 and [ ( bitei)@xmath5(bi@xmath4te@xmath5)@xmath11 have extremely large @xmath22 of 130 mev ( @xmath49 ev@xmath27 ) and 139 mev ( @xmath50 ev@xmath27 ) respectively , which are both larger than that of bulk bitei ( @xmath19 113 mev ) reported before@xcite .",
    "a salient feature of an inversion asymmetric topological insulator is that different crystal surfaces have different tss . in our heterostructure system , due to the giant rss and the freedom to control the properties by layer configurations , more interesting physics",
    "are expected to appear on the sample surface .",
    "as two representative examples with different @xmath10 invariants , we shall discuss bi@xmath1te@xmath38i with @xmath51 and bi@xmath17te@xmath52i@xmath4 ( [ ( bitei)@xmath4(bi@xmath4te@xmath5)@xmath11 ) with @xmath53 in the following .",
    "due to the lack of inversion symmetry , there are two different surfaces of bi@xmath5te@xmath17i ( or bi@xmath17te@xmath52i@xmath4 ) perpendicular to the @xmath14-axis , namely the i - terminated surface and the te - terminated surface .",
    "they are constructed by cleaving the adjacent ql and tl ( tl and tl for bi@xmath17te@xmath52i@xmath4 ) through the weakly coupled te - i gap . as can be seen in fig .",
    "3(a , c ) , although with different @xmath43 index in @xmath10 , the two heterostructures have similar surface spectra .",
    "there are two different kinds of electronic states in the energy window around the bulk band gap . the states with dispersions identical for both i - terminated and te - terminated surfaces are the bulk rss states whose wavefunctions spread over the bulk region , thus are insensitive to the surface environment .",
    "the other states with linear dispersions that cross the bulk gap are the tss . owing to the strong inversion asymmetry ,",
    "tss are very different at different atom - terminated surfaces .",
    "for both heterostructures , the dirac point of tss stays in bulk band gap at i - terminated surface [ fig .",
    "3(a , c ) ] , while it is buried in bulk valence bands at te - terminated surface [ fig .",
    "3(b , d ) ] .",
    "if fermi level lies in the bulk gap below the dirac point of i - terminated surface , the two surfaces of a sample would have different types of charge carriers , which can be used to construct a topological p - n junction@xcite .    due to the coexistence of two types of spin - momentum locking  tss and rss ,",
    "the surface spin texture is expected to be more complicated in our system . in fig .",
    "3(e - g ) , we show the spin projections of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 for the i - terminated surface of bi@xmath5te@xmath17i at different constant energies . in fig .",
    "3(e1 ) at energy 250 mev , there are three contours : inner , middle , and outer ones .",
    "all of them have the largest spin distributions along @xmath57 direction while suppressed values along @xmath58 direction .",
    "the outer and inner ones are from the rss states which have opposite spin polarizations , while the middle one is from the tss .",
    "when shifting the energy level below the rss crossing point [ fig .",
    "3(e2 ) ] , the inner spin contour will change its polarization and then switches place with the middle tss contour and merges with the outer one [ fig .",
    "3(e3 ) ] , leaving only two spin contours . below the conduction band edge , only the tss contour remains and its spin distribution changes sign when the energy level crosses the dirac point [ fig .",
    "the spin projection of @xmath55 shown in fig .",
    "3(f ) shows similar features . combining results in fig .",
    "3(e ) and 3(f ) , one can easily obtain the in - plane spin chiralities of tss and rss states .",
    "for tss , the upper and lower dirac cones have the left- and right - handed spin textures respectively .",
    "for rss states , the inner - branch has the left- ( right- ) handed spin textures above ( below ) the rss crossing point , while the outer - branch always has the right - handed spin texture . the @xmath56 projection shown in fig .",
    "3(g ) represents the out - of - plane spin texture .",
    "it can be observed that the outer rss branch has the largest out - of - plane spin component than tss and the inner branch of rss . for the te - terminated surface , only the spin projections for the upper dirac cone",
    "are shown [ fig .",
    "3(h)-3(j ) ] because the lower dirac cone is deeply buried in the bulk valence bands .",
    "the spin textures of rss states are identical to those of i - terminated surface , hence are not shown here .    apart from the spin - momentum locking discussed above , recent theoretical and experimental works found that in topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 there was an additional locking between spin and orbital for tss , leading to a spin - orbital texture@xcite . following the method of zhang _ _ et al.__@xcite , we calculate the in - plane ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) and out - of - plane ( @xmath20 ) orbital projections together with the orbital - selective spin textures for tss of both i - terminated and te - terminated surfaces of bi@xmath5te@xmath17i .",
    "first let s examine the i - terminated surface . as shown in fig .  4 , for the in - plane orbitals ,",
    "the right - handed spin texture is coupled to tangential ( radial ) orbital texture on the upper ( lower ) dirac cone .",
    "( tangential and radial in - plane orbitals refer to linear combinations of @xmath61 and @xmath62 orbitals with their orbital axis along tangential or radial directions@xcite . ) for the out - of - plane @xmath34 orbital , it is coupled to the left-(right- ) handed spin texture on the upper ( lower ) dirac cone . as for the te - terminated surface ,",
    "the orbital - selective spin textures are opposite to the i - terminated ones .",
    "we have therefore demonstrated that the interesting spin - orbital texture of tss , initially observed in bi@xmath0se@xmath1@xcite , also appears in our inversion asymmetric heterostructure systems .",
    "as we mentioned before , in several aspects , the bitei / bi@xmath4te@xmath5 heterostructure retains the properties of the bulk bitei .",
    "however , the bulk bitei is a trivial insulator .",
    "it can only be converted to a topological insulator under pressure .",
    "in contrast , for the system which we study , no external constraint is required .",
    "it is the intercalation by layers of bi@xmath4te@xmath5 that changes the topological order of the structure . to better understand this result",
    ", we start from the orbital analysis of bi@xmath4te@xmath5 and bitei .",
    "let s focus on the conduction band edge .",
    "the states there are mainly from bi @xmath63 orbitals . for a ql of bi@xmath4te@xmath5 , the @xmath63 orbitals from the two bi atoms can be combined to form bonding and antibonding orbitals . when crystal field is taken into account , @xmath34 orbital",
    "is split from @xmath64 orbitals , with the bonding orbital @xmath65 having the lower energy@xcite , as shown in the left shadowed area of fig .",
    "similar energy splitting due to crystal field also occurs for bitei@xcite .    when the layers of two materials are stacked together to form a heterostructure , due to the overlap between orbitals , the levels with close energies and the same symmetry character are coupled and repel each other . using bi@xmath5te@xmath17i as an example , on the right hand side of fig .",
    "2(a ) , we show the bi@xmath15-@xmath34 ( bi in tls ) and @xmath66 ( bi in qls ) orbital projected character of the low energy conduction bands . at @xmath21 point ,",
    "the @xmath66 and bi@xmath15-@xmath34 orbital are mainly concentrated in the lowest and the second lowest conduction band respectively . as moving towards a point , the coupling between @xmath66 and bi@xmath15-@xmath34 orbitals is getting stronger , which pushes the lowest conduction band downward .",
    "therefore the intercalated bi@xmath4te@xmath5 not only provides the @xmath66 orbital which has a lower energy than the bi@xmath15-@xmath34 orbital , but also through the coupling between the two orbitals it helps to further reduce the band gap ( from 1.2 ev in bulk bitei to 0.52 ev in bi@xmath5te@xmath17i ) .",
    "hence it becomes easier to achieve the band gap inversion when soc is turned on .",
    "this band gap reduction induced by intercalation also helps to explain the observed giant rss .",
    "as been pointed out in the study of bulk bitei@xcite , one of the several factors contributing to a large rss is that the band gap should be small .",
    "approximately , the rss strength is inversely proportional to the gap size .",
    "the reduced gap size of the heterostructure helps to realize a giant rss .",
    "this point is reflected from the results in table ii . the two structures ( [ ( bitei)@xmath4(bi@xmath4te@xmath5)@xmath11 and [ ( bitei)@xmath5(bi@xmath4te@xmath5)@xmath11 ) with rss energy greater than that of bulk bitei indeed have very small band gaps .    to conclude",
    ", we have investigated the crystal structure and electronic properties of the heterostructures [ ( bitei)@xmath6(bi@xmath4te@xmath5)@xmath7 by first principles calculations .",
    "we discover that these heterostructures host both strong topological insulating phase and giant rss in their native states .",
    "moreover , both the @xmath10 invariants that characterize the topological properties and the rashba energy that characterizes strength of rss can be controlled by varying the layer numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the surface electronic structure and spin texture present unique features of the coexistence of tss and rss , and of strongly inversion asymmetric topological insulators .",
    "our result indicates a rich physics in this class of heterostructures which provide an ideal platform for future development of spintronics and quantum computation devices .",

    "<S> a significant discovery is that a strong soc can convert a normal insulator into a topological insulating phase , in which metallic surface states appear in the bulk gap and they are protected by a nontrivial bulk topological order@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another important consequence of soc is the rashba effect in inversion asymmetric structures@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been extensively studied in the context of spintronics , which aims to utilize the electron s spin degree of freedom for device applications . </S>",
    "<S> it is of great interest to search for a material hosting both robust tss and large rss which could be used as a playground to study the interplay between these two interesting effects and also as a base material for technological applications .    </S>",
    "<S> a nonzero rss requires structural inversion symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> it occurs naturally at sample surfaces or interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> for example , rss has been observed at metallic surfaces@xcite , ultrathin metal films@xcite , and semiconductor heterostructures@xcite . in particular , arpes experiments on the topological insulator bi@xmath4se@xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> have shown that rss exists at surfaces with artificially deposited adsorbates@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such rss , however , are typically small and sensitive to the surface environment . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a large rss of the bulk bands is possible in polar compounds with heavy elements , such as the noncentrosymmetric layered semiconductor bitei which was recently reported to have the largest known rss strength@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , bitei is a trivial insulator at ambient condition . </S>",
    "<S> it was proposed that under pressure bitei might be turned into a topological insulator@xcite . but pressure induced structural transition might also occur as suggested by experiments@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the recent progress in the experimental fabrication of layered heterostructures@xcite , here we predict that the coexistence of robust tss and giant rss can be realized in the [ ( bitei)@xmath6(bi@xmath4te@xmath5)@xmath7 heterostructure in its native state without any need of strain or pressure ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the number of layers of each constituent in a unit cell ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that both the topological order and the rss energy can be controlled by varying the number of layers . in particular , the @xmath10 topological invariants of heterostructure with even ( odd ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 are given by [ 1;000 ] ( [ 1;001 ] ) . and </S>",
    "<S> the rss strength is tunable by varying the ratio between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> especially the structures [ ( bitei)@xmath4(bi@xmath4te@xmath5)@xmath11 and [ ( bitei)@xmath5(bi@xmath4te@xmath5)@xmath11 have rashba energies even larger than that of bitei . the tss at different crystalline surfaces are analyzed in detail , which demonstrate characteristic features of a strongly inversion asymmetric topological insulator . </S>",
    "<S> our findings thus identify a promising topological material for future spintronics and quantum computation applications . </S>"
