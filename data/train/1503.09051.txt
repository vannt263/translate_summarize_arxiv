    "it has been shown that a plateau emerges when the energy spectrum is bounded from below since each site of the chain suffers an harmonic potential .",
    "as the central oscillator gets closer to the ground state for negative values of @xmath50 , the energy flowing across this oscillator becomes bounded as the temperature gradient decreases . in the absence of the harmonic confinement",

    "this occurs when @xmath173 and the left and right oscillators are identical @xmath174 , and therefore @xmath175 .",

    "the two - mode entanglement rapidly decreases for positive @xmath50 , while the energy current grows monotonically .",
    "this is expected as the temperature of the whole three - mode system is increased on average , which is generally harmful for entanglement .",
    "previous results have suggested this behavior , in fact it has been shown that in a harmonic chain an increasing @xmath176 is detrimental to build up bipartite or tripartite entanglement due to the rise in the thermal noise @xcite .",
    "in addition , it can be shown from ( [ cffdal ] ) that an initially squeezed environmental state effectively increases the temperature .",
    "hence , in the present setting an initial squeezed bath state does not favor the appearance of stationary entanglement .",
    "moreover , one may expect that non - markovian effects , which are more relevant for super - ohmic dissipation , would substantially degrade the entanglement with respect to the ohmic situation . according to figure ( [ fig1 ] ) ,",
    "the two - mode entanglement is essentially the same for the chain suffering ohmic or super - ohmic dissipation ; namely , @xmath141 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 practically coincide for both situations .",
    "this result is in contrast with the observed transient evolution of the two - mode entanglements under different environmental spectral densities , in which the super - ohmic dissipation induces stronger disentanglement effects @xcite .",

    "the entanglements @xmath177 and @xmath179 increase for lower temperature gradients and stronger couplings .",

    "figure ( [ fig3 ] ) also shows the initial time evolution of the energy current correlations for three different three - mode entanglement configurations .",
    "as expected , the fluctuations of the energy current exhibit an oscillatory behavior , which should be progressively attenuated at larger time intervals . according to a previously reported exponential time decay of the two - time correlation functions ( [ sleq1 ] ) in a damped harmonic oscillator at low temperature @xmath48",
    ", such oscillations should be effectively suppressed at time @xmath197 @xcite .    as evidenced by figure ( [ fig3 ] ) , the energy current correlations exhibit similar oscillations as the system evolves from genuine tripartite to bipartite three - mode entanglement .",
    "the most significant discrepancy between these two configurations is an increase in the oscillation amplitude , which can be attributed to the thermal fluctuations that arise with increasing the temperature gradient .",
    "indeed , a similar oscillating behavior in the fluctuations is still observed at relatively large temperature gradients @xmath198 , when the system is expected to be separable in the three possible bipartitions .",
    "the results we have obtained from an analysis considering an extensive set of parameters @xmath199 corresponding to different multipartite entanglement configurations , for both ohmic and super - ohmic dissipations , also indicate that the energy currents correlations across the harmonic chain are insensitive to the emerge of tripartite genuine or bipartite three - mode entanglement .        to conclude this section we focus on the energy current correlations evaluated at equal time , see figure ( [ fig31 ] ) , which will be useful in the subsequent discussion .",
    "both the stationary fluctuations and the average of the energy current , see figure ( [ fig2 ] ) , grow with increasing the temperature gradient .",
    "but , in contrast to the average energy current , the plateau at small values of the fluctuations is observed above a given value of the coupling strength , which is larger in the case of ohmic dissipation .    once again , the fluctuations of the energy current are insensitive to whether the system experiences bipartite three - mode or genuine tripartite entanglement .",
    "similar results are obtained for the current - current response involving the central and the side oscillators .",
    "one might expect that a scenario similar to the one previously described for the two- and three - mode entanglement would be repeated in the presence of other non - classical correlations , such as discord . in this section",
    "we analyze a possible connection between the energy current and the quantum correlations measured by the right - discord @xmath200 .",
    "although not shown in this work , similar results are obtained from the analysis of the discord @xmath201 measured from the left .",
    "we also point out that the two - mode discord contains the contribution of the two - mode entanglement studied in previous sections .",
    "we have found that discord exhibits a strong dependence on both the temperature gradient and the frequencies of the oscillators .",
    "as shown in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) , its presents a sharp peak centered at the resonance condition @xmath202 , and with an amplitude that grows with increasing the temperature gradient .",
    "interestingly , the discord appears strongly correlated with the mean interaction energy between the oscillators , @xmath203\\ , , \\label{mei}\\ ] ] which has maximum strength also at resonance , see figure ( [ fig4 ] ) . this resonant interaction becomes stronger for higher temperature gradients , which also increase the discord .",
    "as all the negative contribution to @xmath204 comes from the crossed correlation terms , it becomes evident that the maximum interaction strength occurs when these correlations take the highest values , which also turns into the optimal conditions for discord .",
    "this result evidences an underlying connection between the interaction energy and the discord , as could be anticipated considering that the discord would be zero in the absence of interaction .",
    "figure ( [ fig4 ] ) also shows that the discord in the resonant system begins to grow almost linearly with the temperature gradient , and then approaches a constant value at higher gradients .",
    "an initially squeezed central reservoir enhances the creation of discord , both for ohmic and super - ohmic dissipation .",
    "this is in agreement with the foregoing results , as the squeeze of the initial bath state effectively increases the temperature perceived by the oscillators , see eq.([cffdal ] ) .",
    "then an increase of the stationary discord between the side oscillators may be induced either by initially squeezing the central reservoir or increasing its temperature .",
    "it has been shown that discord may be additionally created by local noisy operations , such as dissipation @xcite .",
    "hence , it may happen that discord would be generated by an energy current induced by a temperature gradient , as this current would make each oscillator to dissipate .",
    "considering that the discord contains all the quantum correlations , it would be interesting to analyze whether the entanglement available in the system contributes to its increase with the temperature gradient . at this respect ,",
    "since entanglement can be only created by non - local manipulations and it becomes zero at high temperature gradients , see section ( [ steec ] ) , we may conclude that such increase of the discord must be mainly due to local operations .",
    "the paramount role of the local manipulations in the creation of quantum correlations at resonance conditions is correlated with a maximum average interaction strength between oscillators of similar frequencies , see figure ( [ fig4 ] ) and eq . ( [ mei ] ) .",
    "notice that the discord grows with @xmath50 even in the absence of an energy current between the side oscillators ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "the plateau of maximum discord at high temperature gradients can be attributed to the very low temperatures of the side oscillators @xmath205 , which guarantees the `` coherence '' of the local manipulations .",
    "indeed , the increase in the discord gradually disappear as the mean temperature @xmath48 increases , and therefore the three - mode system approaches to a classic state .",
    "we have observed that the discord @xmath200 has almost disappeared at temperature @xmath206 .",

    "considering that the energy current between two oscillators has an explicit dependence on crossed correlations between them , one could expect that the emerge of entanglement in the system should have detectable effects on such current .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to determine whether a formal connection between entanglement and the average properties of the energy current can be formally established .",
    "the results presented in section [ steec ] indicate that the behavior of the energy current is not modified by the presence of two - mode entanglement . a direct comparison between the two - mode entanglement between the side oscillators @xmath208 and the total energy current @xmath182 suggests an elusive correlation between them , see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "although the most important contribution to the local currents @xmath209 ( [ ef1 ] ) comes from crossed correlation terms that encode part of the quantum correlations shared by the oscillators , the total current @xmath182 ( [ tec ] ) does not have an explicit dependence on the correlation terms involving the @xmath0- and @xmath2- oscillators . then the two - mode entanglement @xmath208 should not necessarily affect the total current .",
    "this reasoning does not exclude , however , the possibility that the total current could be sensitive to the two - mode entanglement shared by the central and the side oscillators .",
    "the conjecture that entanglement and energy current are intimately related would lead to the natural question whether the current @xmath210 could serve as an useful witness of the entanglement between the @xmath9 and @xmath24 oscillators . according to the theory of entanglement ,",

    "in addition , though the correlation terms in eq .",

    "the reliable observation of entanglement relies on the ability to measure non - linear properties of the quantum state @xcite .",
    "according to the expressions for the total energy current @xmath138 ( [ ef1 ] ) and the criterion for entanglement ( [ sc ] ) , the first - moment of the energy current depends linearly on the crossed correlation terms , whereas the entanglement exhibits a non - linear dependence on such terms .",

    ", the fluctuations of the total current ( [ ccr ] ) could manifest the emergence of entanglement , as it involves correlation terms between all the oscillators . in section [ sccr ] we focused on the tripartite entanglement , and showed that @xmath222 seems to be insensitive to the inseparability properties of the three - mode chain .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn from the comparison of the time evolution of the fluctuations @xmath136 at different entanglement configurations of the stationary state , see figure ( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we remark that this result is not in contradiction with the previous argument based on criterion ( [ sc ] ) , as it provides a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for the existence of entanglement .",
    "considering that , in contrast to entanglement , almost any quantum state has a non - negative discord @xcite , a distinct behavior of these two quantum correlations might be expected @xcite .",
    "the results of section ( [ snc ] ) indicate that in the proximity of a resonance condition , a finite energy current induced by the temperature gradient @xmath50 may generate non - classical correlations between the left and right oscillators , even when the total energy current between them becomes zero .",

    "although we have focused on a specific system configuration in which each chain oscillator is connected to an independent heat bath , similar results might be expected for other arrangements , since the emergence of quantum correlations in linear harmonic chains or lattices essentially stems from the proximity of the system to the ground state .",
    "the study of the energy current and quantum correlations in systems exhibiting non - linearities deserves further attention .",

    "this suggests that the non - markovian effects do not significantly modify the markovian results for the _ stationary _ properties of the quantum correlations in a system of oscillators in contact with independent heat baths .",
    "moreover , the initial squeezing of a heat bath effectively increases the temperature that the oscillator chain perceives from this bath , and eventually becomes detrimental for the build - up of stationary entanglement .",
    "a different behavior is observed in the case of discord , which can be created by local noisy operations .",
    "these quantum correlations highly depend on both the interaction strength between the oscillators and the detuning of their natural frequencies .",
    "in particular , the two - mode discord between the side oscillators in the presence of temperature gradients is enhanced at resonance , which indicates that quantum coherence may be favored by thermal non - equilibrium conditions .    according to our results , both the average and the fluctuations of the stationary energy current across the oscillator chain",
    "are mainly determined by the two imposed temperature gradients , and do not seem to be related to the appearance of a rich variety of quantum correlations in the system , comprising two - mode discord and entanglement , bipartite three - mode and genuine tripartite entanglement .",
    "the absence of quantum correlation effects in the average energy current can be partially understood in terms of its linear dependence on the correlation terms between the oscillators . in the case of the fluctuations ,",

    "<S> the discussion of the numerical results is based on the derived expressions for the stationary properties in terms of the two - time correlation functions of the oscillator operators , which carry quantum correlations . </S>",
