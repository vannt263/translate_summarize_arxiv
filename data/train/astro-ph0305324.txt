    "discovery of hydrocarbon ring molecules in interstellar medium has provided an important tool to investigate the medium .",
    "cyclopropenylidene ( cyclic c@xmath1h@xmath4 , denoted as @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath4 ) was the first hydrocarbon ring molecule discovered in astronomical objects by thaddeus et al .",
    "( 1985b ) .",
    "this molecule is ubiquitous in the galactic objects ( matthews and irvine , 1985 ) , and except in one case , its line @xmath8 at 21.59 ghz has always been found in absorption against the cosmic 2.7 k background ( also called the cosmic microwave background , denoted as cmb ) ( madden et al . , 1989 ; chandra & kegel , 2001 ) .",
    "cox et al . ( 1987 ) , however , reported this line in emission in the planetary nebula ngc 7027 .",
    "the second hydrocarbon ring molecule , cyclopropynylidyne ( cyclic c@xmath1h , denoted as @xmath0-c@xmath1h ) was first detected by yamamoto et al .",
    "( 1987 ) in tmc-1 through its transition @xmath2 at 91.5 ghz .",
    "mangum and wootten ( 1990 ) detected @xmath0-c@xmath1h through the transition @xmath9 in 12 additional galactic objects .",
    "the @xmath6-c@xmath1h ( linear c@xmath1h ) also has been identified in astronomical objects ( thaddeus et al . , 1985a ) .",
    "the most probable production mechanism of c@xmath1h and c@xmath1h@xmath4 in dark clouds is a common dissociation reaction of c@xmath1h@xmath5 ion ( adams & smith , 1987 ) :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     owing to the nuclear symmetry in @xmath0-c@xmath1h , rotational levels with even value of @xmath10 are missing in its spectra . as the temperature in dark molecular clouds is not large , in the present investigation we accounted for the rotational levels up to 77 @xmath11 for @xmath0-c@xmath1h ( table 1 ) .",
    "the einstein @xmath12-coefficient for rotational transitions between the levels are calculated following the method discussed by chandra & sahu ( 1993 ) and chandra & rashmi ( 1998 ) .",
    "these 37 rotational levels are connected through 121 radiative transitions . for the calculations ,",
    "the required molecular and distortional constants are taken from yamamoto and saito ( 1994 ) . we have not , however , accounted for fine structure and hyperfine structure splittings of the levels .",
    "nlte occupation numbers of energy levels are calculated in an @xmath13-@xmath14-@xmath15 approximation discussed by rausch et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , where the external radiation field , impinging on a volume element generating the lines , is the cmb only .",
    "besides the radiative transition probabilities for radiatively allowed transitions between the rotational levels , data required for the present investigation are the rate coefficients for collisional transitions between the levels due to collisions with h@xmath4 molecules .",
    "collisional rate coefficients are not available in literature .",
    "therefore , the rate coefficients for downward transitions @xmath16 at a kinetic temperature @xmath17 are taken as ( sharma & chandra , 2001 ) @xmath18 for upward collisional rate coefficients , we accounted for the fact that downward and upward collisional rate coefficients are related through the detailed equilibrium ( chandra & kegel , 2000 ) .",
    "in order to include a large number of cosmic objects where @xmath0-c@xmath1h may be found , numerical calculations are carried out for wide ranges of physical parametres .",
    "the molecular hydrogen density @xmath19 has been varied over the range from 10@xmath20 @xmath21 to 10@xmath22 @xmath21 , and calculations are performed for three kinetic temperatures 10 , 20 and 30 k. in the calculations , free parametres are the molecular hydrogen density @xmath19 , and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is density of the @xmath0-c@xmath1h molecule , and @xmath25 the velocity gradient .",
    "as we have used scaled values of collisional rates , our results are qualitative in nature .      out of a number of lines of @xmath0-c@xmath1h found in absorption against the cmb",
    ", the transition @xmath7 at 3.4 ghz has shown reasonably good absorption phenomenon .",
    "the einstein @xmath12-coefficient for this line is 1.9 x 10@xmath26 s@xmath27 , and the radiative lifetimes of the upper and lower levels @xmath28 and @xmath29 are 2.3 x 10@xmath30 s and 4.4 x 10@xmath30 s , respectively .",
    "observation of a spectral line in absorption against the cmb is an unusual phenomenon .",
    "the intensity , @xmath31 , of a line generated in an interstellar cloud , with homogeneous excitation conditions , is given by @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the intensity of the continuum against which the line is observed , @xmath34 the optical depth of the line , and @xmath35 the source function . for positive optical depth ,",
    "observation of an interstellar line in absorption against the cmb , obviously , implies the excitation temperature of the line , @xmath36 , to be less than the cmb temperature , but positive .",
    "it requires rather peculiar conditions in the molecule generating the line .",
    "variation of line - intensity against the cmb in the units of the planck s function at the kinetic temperature of @xmath17(k ) , i.e. , @xmath37 , for the line @xmath7 for three kinetic temperatures 10 , 20 and 30 k ( written on the top of the column ) is shown in ( first row ) for @xmath38 10@xmath39 and 10@xmath40 @xmath21 ( km / s)@xmath27 pc .",
    "the line @xmath7 shows the absorption against the cmb .",
    "the excitation temperature of the line reduces up to 0.27 k which 10% of the cmb temperature , and its absorption intensity is comparable to the absorption intensity of the line @xmath8 of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath4 calculated by chandra & kegel ( 2001 ) .",
    "it supports the idea of detection of the line @xmath7 of @xmath0-c@xmath1h in absorption against the cmb .      in the above discussion , we considered the external radiation field , impinging on a volume element generating the lines , to be the cmb only . in order to see the effect of a background source , we repeated the calculations for the background intensity @xmath41    @xmath42 is the dilution factor , representing the distance of the background source from the cosmic object , and the effect of the atmosphere between the source and the object . here",
    ", the temperature of the background source is assumed to be 2000 k. for other values of the temperature of the source , the effect can be scaled down with the help of the dilution factor @xmath42 .",
    "the case @xmath43 corresponds to the cmb only . with the increase of the value of @xmath42 the peak of the absorption line decreases .",
    "however , at low densities , the intensity increases .",
    "hence , in the low density regions , a background source can help in detection of the line .",
    "shows the absorption intensities for @xmath42 = 0 , 10@xmath44 and 10@xmath45 .",
    "when @xmath42 is large than 10@xmath45 , the absorption feature disappears .",
    "we repeated the calculations for @xmath0-c@xmath1d radical , where we accounted for the rotational levels given in table 1 .",
    "note that the sequence of some higher levels of @xmath0-c@xmath1d is changed relative to those of the @xmath0-c@xmath1h .",
    "this molecule also is an @xmath46-type asymmetric top molecule with electric dipole moment @xmath47 = 2.4 debye .",
    "the required molecular and distortional constants are taken from yamamoto and saito ( 1994 ) . here ,",
    "also the line @xmath7 at 0.9 ghz is found in absorption against the cmb .",
    "variation of line - intensity against the cmb in the units of planck s function at the kinetic temperature of @xmath17(k ) , i.e. , @xmath48 , for the line for three kinetic temperatures 10 , 20 and 30 k and the dilution factor @xmath42 = 0 , 10@xmath44 and 10@xmath45 is shown in for @xmath49 10@xmath39 and 10@xmath40 @xmath21 ( km / s)@xmath27 pc . the line @xmath7 of @xmath0-c@xmath1d is found to be weaker than that of the @xmath0-c@xmath1dh . however , the features of the two are very similar .",
