    "recent observations of high redshift type ia supernovae reveal that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion rather than decelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "in addition , the discovery of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy on degree scales together with the galaxy redshift surveys indicate @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 .",
    "all these results strongly suggest that the universe is permeated smoothly by dark energy which has a negative pressure and violates the strong energy condition .",
    "the dark energy and accelerating universe has been discussed extensively from different points of view @xcite . in principle , a natural candidate to dark energy could be a small cosmological constant . however , there exist serious theoretical problems : fine tuning problem and coincidence problem .",
    "to overcome the coincidence problem , some self - interacting scaler fields @xmath8 with an equation of state ( eos ) @xmath9 were introduced dubbed quintessence , where @xmath10 is time varying and negative . in principle , the potentials of the scalar field would be determined from the underlying physical theories , such as supergravity , superstring / m - theory etc .. however , disregarding these underlying physical theories and just starting from the phenomenal level , one can design many kinds of potentials to solve the concrete problems @xcite .",
    "once the potentials are given , eos @xmath10 of dark energy can be found . on the contrary",
    ", the potential can be reconstructed by a given eos @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "then , the forms of the scalar potential can be obtained by the observations data with a given eos @xmath10 .",
    "the idea that our world may have more than four dimensions is due to kaluza @xcite , who unified einstein s theory of general relativity with maxwell s theory of electromagnetism in a @xmath0 manifold . in 1926 , klein reconsidered kaluza s idea and treated the extra dimension as a compacted small circle topologically @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the kaluza - klein idea has been studied extensively from different points of view . among them , a kind of theory named space - time - matter theory is designed to incorporate the geometry and matter by wesson and his collaborators , for reviews please see @xcite and references therein . in stm theory , our world is a hypersurface embedded in a five - dimensional ricci flat ( @xmath11 ) manifold and all the matter in our world are induced from the higher dimension , which is supported by campbell s theorem @xcite which says that any analytical solution of einstein field equation of @xmath12 dimensions can be locally embedded in a ricci - flat manifold of @xmath13 dimensions . since the matter are induced from the extra dimension , this theory is also called induced matter theory .",
    "the application of the idea about induced matter or induced geometry can also be found in other situations @xcite .",
    "the stm theory allows the metric components to be dependent on the extra dimension and does not require the extra dimension to be compact or not .",
    "the consequent cosmology in stm theory is studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in a @xmath5 spatially flat flrw universe , the friedmann equation can be written as @xmath14 where , the universe is dominated by barotropic perfect fluids with equation of state ( eos ) @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) ( where @xmath17 for pressureless cold dark matter and @xmath18 for radiation ) and spatially homogenous scalar filed @xmath8 , dubbed quintessence .",
    "the energy density and pressure of the scalar field @xmath8 are @xmath19 respectively , where @xmath4 is the potential of the scalar field .",
    "the potential of the scalar fields is designed in different forms to obtain desired properties as has been interpreted in the introduction [ introduction ] .",
    "the equation of state of the scalar field is @xmath20 using eqs .",
    "( [ scalarfield])-([eosscalar ] ) , one has @xmath21 the evolution equation of the scalar field @xmath8 is @xmath22 which yields @xcite @xmath23\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv&\\rho_{\\phi 0}e(z),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath24 is the redshift and the subscript @xmath25 denotes the current value .",
    "then one obtains the potential in term of @xmath10 @xmath26=\\frac{1}{2}(1-w_{\\phi})\\rho_{\\phi 0}e(z).\\label{vz}\\ ] ] in terms of redshift , the friedmann equation can be written as @xmath27,\\label{hz}\\ ] ] where , @xmath28s and @xmath29 are the current values of dimensionless density parameters determined by observations .",
    "within the framework of stm theory , a class of exact @xmath0 cosmological solution was given by liu and mashhoon in 1995 @xcite .",
    "then , in 2001 , liu and wesson @xcite restudied the solution and showed that it describes a cosmological model with a big bounce as opposed to a big bang .",
    "the @xmath0 metric of this solution reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two arbitrary functions of @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the @xmath37 curvature index @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is a constant .",
    "this solution satisfies the 5d vacuum equation @xmath11 .",
    "so , the three invariants are @xmath40 the invariant @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ 3-invar ] ) shows that @xmath39 determines the curvature of the 5d manifold .",
    "it would be pointed out that the @xmath0 and @xmath5 planck mass are not related directly , because in the stm theory one always has @xmath42 .",
    "so , in @xmath5 we can take @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is @xmath5 newtonian gravitation constant .    using the @xmath5 part of the @xmath0 metric ( [ 5-metric ] ) to calculate the @xmath5 einstein tensor , one obtains @xmath45 in our previous work @xcite , the induced matter was set to be a conventional matter plus a time variable cosmological ` constant ' or three components : dark matter radiation and @xmath46-matter . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the induced matter contains four parts : cdm @xmath47 , baryons @xmath48 , radiation @xmath49 and dark energy @xmath50 .",
    "so , we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 from eqs.([frw - eq ] ) and ( [ eos - x ] ) , one obtains the eos of the dark energy @xmath53 and the dimensionless density parameters @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the hubble and deceleration parameters were given in @xcite , @xcite , @xmath58 from which we see that @xmath59 represents an accelerating universe , @xmath60 represents a decelerating universe .",
    "so the function @xmath1 plays a crucial role in defining the properties of the universe at late time .",
    "we only consider the spatial flat case @xmath61 . in eqs .",
    "( [ frw - eq])-([df ] ) , @xmath62 does not explicitly appear in the equations .",
    "so , to avoid boring to choose the concrete forms @xmath62 , we use @xmath63 and define @xmath64 ( noting that @xmath65 ) , and then we find that the eqs .",
    "( [ wx])-([df ] ) reduce to @xmath66 as is known from the quintessence and phantom dynamical dark energy models , there exist undefined potentials @xmath4 .",
    "one can choose different forms of the potential @xmath4 to describe the desired properties of dark energy @xcite , in which many forms of the potential are given .",
    "now , there is an arbitrary function @xmath1 in the present @xmath0 model .",
    "different choice of @xmath1 corresponds to different choice of the potential @xmath4 in quintessence or phantom models . by transforming @xmath35 to redshift @xmath2 ,",
    "the choices of @xmath1 corresponds to the choice of @xmath3 .",
    "this enables us to look for desired properties of the universe via eqs .",
    "( [ wx-2])-([q ] ) . in these definition ,",
    "the friedmann equation becomes @xmath67 where , @xmath68 is the current hubble parameter . these enable us to use the supernova observations data to constrain the parameters contained in the model or function @xmath3 .",
    "and then we can postulate it in the early evolution epoch of the universe and discuss the possible phenomena . by comparing eq .",
