    "the neutron star crust is expected to be for the most part an elastic solid , comprising a coulomb lattice of nuclei , unbound electrons and , in the inner crust , fluid neutrons external to the nuclei @xcite . however , in the deep layers of the inner crust , near the crust - core boundary , the state of matter is more uncertain , and the possibility that the nuclei may undergo a series of shape transitions from spherical to cylindrical and slab , and then inverting to form the corresponding bubble configurations , has been widely studied @xcite .",
    "more complex shapes can also exist @xcite .",
    "these phases are collectively termed ` nuclear pasta ' .",
    "most studies have focussed on delineating the crustal region populated by the pasta phases .",
    "important questions to address include : are there any practically observable neutron star phenomena that are sensitive to the properties of the pasta phase ( assuming they are different to those of a coulomb crystal ) ? in what aspects of neutron star modeling do we need to seriously pay attention to the properties of the pasta phases , and what modeling can we safely ignore the possibility of their existence ?",
    "the sensitivity of the pasta phases to neutrino interactions have been studied @xcite , and the possibility that the direct urca cooling process is allowed in the bubble phases of the pasta introduces a potential observational probe should a young enough neutron star be found @xcite .",
    "the pasta phases are unlikely to be solid ; they are strongly analogous to terrestrial complex fluids @xcite which exhibit a wide range of responses to mechanical stimuli which are strongly dependent on the timescale over which the stimuli are applied .",
    "the modeling of mechanical properties such as the shear modulus is a very complex task , and requires simulating the structure and mechanical properties of matter over a wide range of length scales and timescales @xcite .",
    "usually , in modeling phenomena associated with elastic properties of the neutron star crust , the shear modulus is taken to be that of a coulomb crystal over the whole crust .",
    "in this paper we will estimate the maximal effect of the pasta phases on two elastic crustal processes that lead to potentially observable effects by comparing the case where the shear modulus in the pasta phases is taken to be that of a crystalline solid ( which we refer to as ` solid ' pasta ) , with the case where the shear modulus is set to zero ( which we we refer to as ` liquid ' pasta ) .",
    "the two neutron star properties we will examine are the maximal quadrupole deformation of the crust and the frequency of torsional oscillations of the crust .",
    "the former is important to determine the likelihood of observing gravitational wave emission mechanism from rotating , deformed neutron stars @xcite and the latter is a proposed mechanism for generating quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the tails of light curves of giant flares from soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient in the crust and core models is the symmetry energy of nuclear matter as a function of density , @xmath2 , which can be defined as the energy difference per nucleon between pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter ( equal numbers of protons and neutrons ) at a given density .",
    "its density dependence @xmath1 at nuclear saturation density @xmath3 @xmath4 , related to the pressure of pure neutron matter @xmath5 through the relation @xmath6 , is strongly correlated with the crust - core transition density and the thickness of the pasta layers @xcite , as well as global properties of the star such as the radius and moment of inertia @xcite .",
    "we will use a simple crustal model which is self - consistent with the core equation of state , and vary the value of the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density over its experimentally constrained range to take into account these correlations consistently .",
    "in section 2 we outline the approximate expressions we will use to estimate torsional frequencies and mountains , as well as give details about the eos used and crustal model , including the shear modulus . in section 3",
    "we give the results and in section 4 we discuss our conclusions .",
    "the shear modulus of a coulomb lattice of positively charged nuclei in a uniform negatively charged background in the neutron star crust at a baryon number density @xmath7 was determined through monte - carlo simulation @xcite and can be written as    [ eq : shear_mod ] = 0.1106 ( ) ^1/3 a^-4/3 n_b^4/3 ( 1-x_n)^4/3 ( ze)^2 ,    where the nuclei are characterized by the nucleon and proton number @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the fraction of neutrons not confined to the nuclei .",
    "this is the zero - temperature expression , a good approximation for neutron star temperatures below @xmath10k .",
    "we assume that the shear modulus is isotropic . from this one",
    "can calculate the speed of shear waves in the crust @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mass density corresponding to the baryon number density @xmath7 .",
    "we will use the expression to calculate the following quantities :    1 .",
    "the fundamental frequency and overtones of crustal torsional oscillations can be estimated as @xcite + [ freq ] + l l ^2_0 , + [ over ] ^2_n e^- n v_s , + respectively , assuming an isotropic crust .",
    "@xmath13 is the number of radial nodes the mode has , and @xmath14 is the angular ` quantum ' number . in order to estimate the superfluid effects of the dripped neutrons , one introduces a multiplicative factor @xmath15 @xcite , where + [ entrain ] _ = ( 1 - x_n ) + encodes the effect of entrainment of the free neutrons by the lattice , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the radius of the crust - core boundary .",
    "this formula is derived from a plane wave analysis of the crustal shear perturbation equations @xcite , and has , in a related form and without superfluid effects , been used to study the influence of the nuclear eos on torsional mode frequencies @xcite .",
    "the mesoscopic effective mass @xmath18 encodes the ` drag ' on the superfluid neutrons by the crystal lattice through which they flow ; it has been calculated for a limited number of densities @xcite . in this work",
    "we take the two extreme values @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the latter corresponding to no entrainment effect . note",
    "that the effective mass is the only quantity we do not calculate self - consistently with the crustal and core eos used , something that should be addressed in future studies .",

    "this has the simple physical interpretation of the ratio the stress energy to the gravitational energy of the star multiplied by the breaking strain of the crust @xmath24 .",
    "this simple estimate has been confirmed by rigorous calculations @xcite .",
    "the breaking strain has recently been estimated to be @xmath25 using molecular dynamics simulations @xcite . additionally , we calculate the equivalent gravitational wave strain amplitude from a rotating neutron star with a moment of inertia @xmath26 , frequency @xmath27 and distance to earth @xmath28 @xcite : + @xmath29    from our crustal model , we need the crustal composition and density at the crust - core and spherical - pasta transitions .",
    "we use the compressible liquid drop model ( cldm ) developed in @xcite . like the liquid drop and droplet models of terrestrial nuclei , the cldm focusses on the average , macroscopic properties of nuclear clusters in the crust such as their mass and size , whilst neglecting quantum shell effects .",
    "the interior nuclear density is a free variable ( i.e. the nuclear clusters are compressible ) rather than specified _ a priori _ as the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "an external gas of dripped neutrons , expected to coexist with the nuclear clusters in the inner crust , is calculated using the same bulk hamiltonian as the matter inside the clusters .",
    "the interfacial energy between the two bulk phases is obtained by specifying the magnitude and proton fraction dependence of the surface tension using the form of lattimer _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the neutron star inner crust is assumed to have a periodic structure microscopically , and the wigner - seitz ( w - s ) approximation is employed in which the unit cell , which generally will have a cubic or more complicated structure , can be replaced by a cell of the same volume and possessing the same geometry as the nuclear cluster .",
    "we consider spherical , cylindrical and planar geometries for both normal nuclear clusters and bubbles .",
    "the equilibrium cell size , nuclear size , proton fraction and dripped neutron density are calculated by minimizing the total energy of one cell at a given baryon number density .",
    "the energetically preferred phase is determined by calculating the equilibrium energy density for each of the six nuclear geometries and for uniform matter , and selecting the lowest . by repeating the calculation for the density range of the inner crust",
    ", we obtain the composition and the transition densities ( the transition to pasta is taken to be the transition between spherical - cylindrical geometries ) .",
    "the bulk nuclear energy is given by a skyrme - like interaction msl @xcite .",
    "the msl interaction contains parameters directly related to the slope of the symmetry energy , allowing @xmath1 to be freely adjusted and giving us the ability to scan the appropriate parameter space of the nuclear interaction without changing the properties of the symmetric nuclear matter eos .",
    "we take as a conservative range of @xmath1 from nuclear experiment @xmath30 mev @xcite , although it is worth noting that the most recent constraints @xcite , coupled with inference from theoretical calculations of pure neutron matter @xcite , place the value of @xmath1 in the lower half of this range 25 - 75 mev .",
    "we hold the absolute value of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density constant at @xmath31 mev throughout .",
    "we use the same uniform nuclear matter eos as input into the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations to calculate the global neutron star properties needed ( mass @xmath21 , radius @xmath22 , and crust thickness @xmath32 , crust volume @xmath23 ) , and approximate the moment of inertia using the formula @xcite    [ inertia ] i 0.237 m r^2    _ as an upper estimate for the effect of nuclear pasta on the crustal shear phenomena , we will set the pasta shear modulus to zero_. we will thus be exploring two extreme cases distinguished by the density @xmath33 at which we evaluate the shear modulus for use in eqs .",

    "pasta as a liquid ; then the shear modulus is evaluated at the boundary between the phase of spherical nuclei and the pasta phases @xmath35    taking pasta phases to be liquid , we are effectively moving the boundary between the solid crust and the liquid core of the star down in density , so that the solid crust gets thinner .",
    "one would then expect the fundamental mode frequency to decrease , along with @xmath36 .",

    "the well - known inverse correlation between the crust - core transition density and @xmath1 is manifest ; the corresponding inverse correlation between the crust - core transition pressure and @xmath1 is also shown , although one should note that this relation is dependent on the nuclear model used @xcite and is sensitive to other parameters of the nuclear eos .",

    "it is important to note that in the semi - classical liquid drop model , shell effects are not included , which could significantly affect the trend .",

    "it is immediately obvious that the influence of the pasta phases disappears at @xmath39 mev .",
    "the shear modulus and speed decrease as @xmath1 increases ; thus shear phenomena in the crust will be strongest for @xmath1 at the lower end of the experimentally constrained range .",

    "the thickness and volume of the crust that contains spherical nuclei and the total crust with the pasta phases included both increase with @xmath1 at @xmath41 mev and then decrease at higher @xmath1 .",
    "this trend is the convolution of the decrease of the transition densities with @xmath1 and the increase of the stellar radius with @xmath1 .",
    "the moment of inertia follows a similar trend .",
    "the thickness of the pasta layer is greatest at intermediate values of @xmath42 mev , rising to about 10% of the crustal thickness and volume .",
    "it is important to note that , although the pasta layers occupy a small layer of the crust in terms of radius of volume , they occupy the highest density region of the crust , so the fraction of the mass of the crust occupied by the pasta layers will be much higher , approaching 50% @xcite .",

    "the pasta phases become insignificant , but the stiffening of the eos and reduction of the crust - core transition density means that the crust thickness relative to the size of the star overall becomes smaller , and the maximum ellipticity sustainable falls by almost two orders of magnitude compared to the canonical value .",

    "the effect of the pasta phases is comparable with other transport properties such as entrainment of superfluid neutrons .",
    "in addition , we have demonstrated that a consistent treatment of the crust composition and core equation of state is required in modeling these phenomena , and that when one uses such a consistent treatment the possibility of constraining the nuclear symmetry energy at densities around saturation using astrophysical observations emerges .",
    "the models of torsional modes and mountain building in neutron star crusts have many other uncertainties .",
    "having a diverse range of neutron star phenomena amenable to independent observation allows one to check the consistency of our models ; studying the signature of nuclear matter properties in such phenomena opens up another set of constraints from nuclear experiment .",
    "clearly , more work needs to be done investigating the likely structure of the pasta phases over a variety of length scales and estimating their actual shear modulus .",
    "this is likely to depend on the particular shapes present .",
    "one also can not ignore temperature effects , especially for the long timescale process of accreting material onto the crust @xcite .",
    "the pasta phases are likely to be disordered on length scales of @xmath55 cell lengths due to thermal fluctuations @xcite ; however , we can not rule out some ordering mechanism involving , for example , the magnetic field .",
    "one might envisage the cylinders or slabs aligning along a particular direction , giving the phases liquid crystal - like properties @xcite .",
    "the approximation of pasta being a liquid may be quite good for accretion processes which build mountains , as it is known that many complex fluids exhibit continuous flow in response to stress applied slowly over long timescales .",
    "a more microscopic treatment of crustal matter , including shell effects of nuclei and dripped neutrons , is also necessary for a more realistic determination of the transition densities and superfluid effects .",
    "we hope that demonstrating the feasibility of setting limits on those properties observationally provides additional motivation for these further studies .",
    "while finalizing this manuscript , we learned of a similar study which focusses on the torsional crust oscillations @xcite .",
    "we briefly comment on how our study compares with the results obtained there .",
    "the main difference is that , whereas we use approximate methods for the description of the torsional modes and a consistent treatment of crust and core eos , @xcite uses a more sophisticated calculation of the crustal frequencies , but a specific crust and core eos which are not consistent with each other .",
    "the core eos used in @xcite is relatively stiff , giving neutron star radii consistent in our model with @xmath56 mev @xcite , putting it outside of current best experimental and observational estimates @xcite .",
    "the crustal composition model is that of douchin and haensel ( dh ) @xcite , using the sly4 eos with @xmath57 mev . the transition density to the pasta phases",
    "is taken as a free parameter rather than emerging consistently from the crustal model ( indeed , the dh eos predicts no pasta phases ) ; the lower value taken , @xmath58 @xmath4 , is well below that which is realistically expected from liquid drop and more microscopic models .",
    "the range we find is 0.05 - 0.07 @xmath59 g @xmath60 .",
    "the differences in our methods makes a direct comparison of our results difficult .",
    "for example , @xcite obtains a fundamental mode frequency of @xmath61 hz for a @xmath40 neutron star when the shear modulus is taken to be that of a coulomb crystal up to the crust - core boundary , compared with @xmath62 hz in our model , taken at @xmath57 mev ; however , the stiffness of the crust in the sotani model would lead to a thinner crust and a decrease in the frequency compared with our results .",
    "it would be useful to make a comparison of the methods used using consistent nuclear physics . as a final note",
