    "forces induced by thermal fluctuations can be very sensitive to tiny changes in temperature .",
    "this is exemplified by effective forces arising between two surfaces confining a fluid close to its critical point , for which a slight variation in temperature can lead to pronounced changes in their range and magnitude .",
    "the universal features of these so - called critical casimir forces are captured by scaling functions @xcite ; they have been studied theoretically and experimentally for systems belonging to the bulk universality classes of the @xmath0 and the ising model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 model describes quantum fluids , such as liquid @xmath1he close to its normal - superfluid phase transition or a @xmath2he-@xmath1he mixture close to its tricritical point , whereas , e.g. , a classical binary liquid mixture near its demixing point or a simple fluid close to a liquid - gas critical point belong to the ising universality class .    in the systems studied so far experimentally ,",
    "the measured critical casimir forces have been either attractive or repulsive throughout the _ whole _ temperature range .",
    "( the addition of salt to a critical oil - water mixture presents a notable exception in that , under favorable conditions , on route to the critical demixing point the sign of the critical casimir force can change twice @xcite due to a coupling between the noncritical charge density and the critical order parameter field . ) here , we investigate simple systems which provide the possibility of changing the sign of the critical casimir forces upon varying the temperature . analytic studies and computer simulations",
    "indicate that the sign of the critical casimir force is determined by the properties of the confining surfaces , i.e. , by the boundary conditions ( bcs ) which they impose on the fluctuations of the order parameter characterizing the underlying second - order phase transition .",
    "indirect measurements of the casimir scaling function , inferred from wetting films of superfluids @xcite and of classical binary liquid mixtures @xcite , are consistent with these predictions . for pure",
    "@xmath1he one has symmetric dirichlet - dirichlet @xmath3 bcs because the quantum mechanical wave function of the superfluid state vanishes at both confining interfaces .",
    "this gives rise to attractive critical casimir forces @xcite .",
    "for wetting films of @xmath2he-@xmath1he mixtures , @xmath4 bcs are realized because due to quantum mechanical effects a @xmath1he - rich layer forms near the solid - liquid interface and favors the superfluid phase giving rise to the so - called surface transition @xcite ; @xmath5 indicates a symmetry - breaking bc with the surface completely ordered . upon reaching the surface transition",
    "the superfluid order parameter becomes nonzero at the solid surface whereas it vanishes at the fluid - vapor interface of the wetting film .",
    "these asymmetric bcs give rise to a repulsive casimir force .",
    "measurements for wetting films of certain classical binary liquids mixtures have been found to be in agreement with @xmath6 bcs corresponding to a strong opposing preferential adsorption of the two species of the mixture at the two confining surfaces @xcite . within the framework of an ising magnet ( which is equivalent to the lattice model of a binary mixture ) or within the continuum field theory for the order parameter ,",
    "this amounts to the presence of strong antagonistic symmetry - breaking surface fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 which couple linearly to the order parameter and give rise to repulsive critical casimir forces .",
    "direct evidences for critical casimir forces have been provided by studying the brownian motion of a single colloidal particle near a flat substrate surface and immersed in the binary liquid mixture of water and lutidine @xcite .",
    "the experimental results for the cases in which the colloid and the substrate surface preferentially adsorb the same species of the mixture are consistent with @xmath9 or @xmath10 bcs , whereas for cases in which the particle and the surface preferentially adsorb different species of the mixture the results agree with the occurrence of @xmath11 or @xmath12 bcs . whereas the theoretical and experimental understanding of critical casimir forces in the presence of strong or vanishing surface fields has reached a mature level , here we set out to study the influence of variable weak surface fields .",
    "dirichlet and @xmath13 bcs are the renormalization - group fixed - point boundary conditions corresponding to the so - called ordinary surface universality class @xmath14 and the normal transition surface universality class , respectively @xcite .",
    "the ordinary transition corresponds to the bulk phase transition occurring in the absence of surface fields and with a reduced tendency to order at the surface . within a mean field picture the latter",
    "is described by a surface scaling field @xmath15 so that @xmath16 plays the role of an extrapolation length of the order parameter profile ; @xmath17 defines the ordinary transition fixed point .",
    "the normal transition occurs for systems with strong surface fields and which exhibit a reduced tendency to order if these surface fields are switched off .",
    "the normal transition is defined by the fixed point ( @xmath18 ) . as indicated by the nomenclature",
    "the normal transition is the generic situation for a fluid . in a spin model as discussed below @xmath19 is dimensionless with @xmath20 as an interaction constant ( see below ) .    near the ordinary transition",
    "there is a single linear scaling field @xmath21 associated with the surface field of strength @xmath22 and the surface enhancement parameter @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the scaling exponent is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the surface counterparts of the bulk gap exponent @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a crossover exponent @xcite .",

    "fixed - point behavior , i.e. , the decay of the op occurs @xcite .",

    "for the @xmath66 ising model on the square lattice with lattice constant @xmath67 , the length @xmath42 has been extracted from an exact result for the scaling function of the op profile below and above @xmath68 ; the profile at @xmath68 has not been reported . in the case",
    "that the exchange coupling between spins in the surface row is the same as in the bulk , the op scaling function depends on the scaling variable @xmath69 with @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the dimensionless reduced exchange coupling between ising spins and @xmath72 @xcite .",

    "the critical properties of the confined systems are particularly sensitive to the values of the surface fields , i.e. , whether one or both length scales @xmath89 become comparable to or even larger than the distance @xmath82 , together with @xmath90 .",
    "for example , in films with identical surface fields , i.e. , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , at bulk criticality and for weak surface fields the order parameter profile exhibits two symmetric maxima at @xmath61 and @xmath93 ; for even weaker fields so that @xmath94 these maxima merge into a single one at midpoint @xmath95 @xcite .",

    "because the choice of the surface fields for the presented data is different from ours , we can not make a direct quantitative comparison ( except for the case of ( @xmath413 ) for which the data agree ) .",
    "however , there is a qualitative agreement with our findings ; for certain choices of the surface fields the critical casimir force changes sign as function of temperature .",
    "this agreement provides further evidence for the universal character of critical casimir forces .    our data for the critical casimir scaling function have the crucial advantage over the results in @xmath408 and 4 that they can be directly compared with possible experimental data .",
    "interestingly , in all spatial dimensions studied the crossover behavior of the scaling function of the critical casimir force as a function of the temperature scaling variable is qualitatively the same .",
    "the robustness of this observation indicates that an experimental observation of the change of sign of the critical casimir force with temperature is possible , provided that the chemical properties of the confining surfaces are carefuly chosen .",
