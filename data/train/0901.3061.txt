    "the filled - skutterudite compound pros@xmath2sb@xmath3 has recently obtained considerable attention .",
    "there are several reasons for that .",
    "it is a heavy fermion ( @xmath6 ) superconductor with a transition temperature of @xmath7(pr ) = 1.85 k. this temperature is larger than the one of the related system laos@xmath2sb@xmath3 which is @xmath7(la ) = 0.74 k. a number of experiments , like those on sb - nmr relaxation rate in pr@xmath0la@xmath1os@xmath2sb@xmath3   @xcite suggest that the superconducting order parameter is of the conventional isotropic @xmath8-wave type with possible admixture of higher harmonics depending on the pr content @xcite .",
    "however , questions and ambiguities remain .",
    "they concern the experimental findings for the penetration depth @xcite and initial studies of the thermal conductivity in a rotating magnetic field @xcite .",
    "for example , the former suggest a possible nodal structure while the latter in addition points towards two distinct superconducting phases .",
    "the observed enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature by more than a factor of two when la is replaced by pr seems surprising at first sight .",
    "it is well known that when pr ions are added as impurities to an @xmath8 wave superconductor like lapb@xmath9 it suppresses the superconducting transition temperature rather efficiently .",
    "so why does it enhance @xmath7 in the present case ?",
    "since the phonons in laos@xmath2sb@xmath3 and pros@xmath2sb@xmath3 are very nearly the same , the enhancement must come from the two 4@xmath10 electrons which pr@xmath11 has .",
    "the heavy fermion behavior of pros@xmath2sb@xmath3 seems puzzling too .",
    "it shows up in a large specific heat jump @xmath12 500 mj/(mol k@xmath13 ) at @xmath7 and also in a large effective mass in de haas - van alphen experiments .",
    "the kondo effect can not be the origin of the heavy quasiparticles since the 4@xmath14 electrons are well localized with a hund s rule total angular momentum @xmath15 and a non - kramers ground state .",
    "the key to the enhancement of @xmath7 and the formation of heavy quasiparticle excitations lies in the crystalline electric field ( cef ) splitting of the @xmath15 multiplet ( sect .",
    "[ sect : cef ] ) , together with the aspherical coulomb scattering mechanism of conduction electrons from cef excitations @xcite .",
    "the self energy and effective mass enhancement due to this mechanism will be calculated in sect .",
    "[ sect : mass ] .",

    "from inelastic neutron scattering the cef energy levels are known .",
    "the compound has tetrahedral @xmath23 site symmetry for pr .",
    "the data are explained best by a cef ground state    @xmath24    with a low - lying triplet excited state at an energy of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the other cef levels are so high in energy that they can be neglected .",
    "the @xmath26 triplet state of @xmath23 symmetry is a superposition of two triplets @xmath27 and @xmath28 of o@xmath22 symmetry .",
    "more specifically one finds @xcite    @xmath29    with states of o@xmath22 symmetry given by    @xmath30    the conduction electrons interact with the cef energy levels of the pr@xmath11 ions .",

    "it is a quadrupolar type of interaction .",
    "an important feature of pros@xmath2sb@xmath3 is the experimental finding that the low - energy triplet state has a small value of @xmath51 with the implication that the inelastic scattering of the conduction electrons is predominantly of quadrupolar character . with this information",
    "the two features pointed out above , i.e. , the increase of @xmath7 when la is replaced by pr and the heavy quasiparticle mass can be understood quantitatively @xcite .",
    "as has been known for a long time quadrupolar inelastic scattering of conduction electrons by low - energy cef levels enhances cooper pairing since these excitations act similarly as a localized phonon mode .",
    "the difference is that phonons are related to changes in the ion position while intra - atomic quadrupolar cef excitations are related to changes of the 4@xmath14 wavefunction .",
    "also the heavy quasiparticle mass is related to the inelastic scattering processes of the conduction electrons .",
    "this feature has been previously exploited to explain the mass enhancement found in pr metal using the isotropic dipolar exchange interaction h@xmath52 @xcite . as mentioned above in pr@xmath0la@xmath1os@xmath2sb@xmath3",
    "the aspherical coulomb scattering h@xmath53 is dominant over exchange scattering . for this model",
    "a quantitative calculation of the changes in @xmath7 and the mass enhancement as function of pr concentration are found in ref .  .",
    "the aim of the present communication is to extend the previous calculations by including the effect of an external magnetic field on the mass enhancement .",
    "a field splits the triplet states and leads to a decrease of the excitation energy of one of the three states , at least for small tetrahedral admixture d as in pros@xmath2sb@xmath3 .",
    "therefore an increase of the effective mass with increasing field is expected in this case .",
    "the situation is different for pr metal mentioned before where ground state and first excited state are two singlets .",
    "there a magnetic field pushes the two energy levels apart and hence increases the excitation energy . as a consequence the effective quasiparticle mass decreases with increasing external field in agreement with experimental findings@xcite . in the present singlet - triplet model",

    "the average distance between the pr 4f shells becomes larger and therefore the effective quadruplar coupling @xmath277 will decrease with x , i.e. the dispersion of the 4f cef ecxitons will progressively decrease .",
    "this means that the field dependence of effective masses will become more pronounced according to figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2],[fig : fig3 ] . of course the _ absolute _ ( zero - field )",
    "size of the mass enhancement is also reduced since the self energy in eq .",
    "( [ 2.18a ] ) will be proportional to the number ( 1-x ) of pr sites .",
