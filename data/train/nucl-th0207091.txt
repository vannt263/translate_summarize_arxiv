    "the experimental search for exotic states in one - baryon and two - baryon spectra has a long history , see review  @xcite .",
    "the enthusiasm has been revived in the field after two recent experimental reports  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the reaction @xmath2 was investigated and three narrow peaks ( width @xmath3  mev ) in the missing mass spectrum were seen at @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 mev with high statistical significance . ref .",
    "@xcite reported about the study of the reaction @xmath7 .",
    "three peaks of the 5  mev width were clearly observed in the missing mass @xmath8 spectrum at @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11  mev . in the missing mass @xmath12 spectrum",
    "the peaks are located at @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15  mev .",
    "the correspondence between peaks in refs .",
    "@xcite was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the evident regularity of the peaks observed in  @xcite contrasts with previous experimental data  @xcite limited by a lower resolution in energy and lower statistics , although the compiled analyses of all available data of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that a similar pattern glimpses in the old data too .",
    "the true nature of these resonances is obscure so far and three interpretations are suggested in the literature : ( i )  the peaks can be assigned to supernarrow dibaryon resonances ( @xmath16 ) , which have been predicted theoretically within the bag  @xcite and the chiral soliton  @xcite models ; ( ii )  the peaks can be interpreted as new nucleon resonances ( @xmath17 ) ; ( iii )  they are bound states of one or two nucleons with several light pseudoscalar particles ( @xmath18 ) having mass @xmath19  mev  @xcite .",
    "the above interpretations imply that the new particles should have an exotic internal quark structure , having only a small overlap with usual nucleon and pion states .",
    "otherwise they would be produced with a large probability and would manifest themselves in many nuclear reaction channels , where they are not seen , as we know . for",
    "the dibaryonic interpretation , the smallness of the production cross sections  @xcite and estimates  @xcite suggest that the pion-@xmath16-deuteron coupling should be at least ten times weaker than the standard @xmath20 coupling .",
    "nucleon resonances below the @xmath21 threshold should have tiny couplings to @xmath21 and @xmath22 states otherwise they would spoil the dispersion relations for @xmath21 and compton scattering , which are fulfilled with good precision  @xcite .",
    "smallness of the @xmath23 coupling requires also smallness of @xmath24 and @xmath25 couplings .",
    "the coupling of `` light pions '' ( @xmath18 ) to usual pions and nucleons should also be strongly suppressed in order not to contradict the data on @xmath26 and @xmath21 interactions , cf .",
    "discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "despite the fact that the exotic states do not show up on the typical time scale of strong interactions , according to their properties mentioned above , they could manifest themselves in long living nuclear systems , such as atomic nuclei and neutron stars ( ns ) .",
    "they could be also produced with a detectable probability in particle - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions as well as other rare probes ( photons , di - leptons , strange particles , etc ) .",
    "the small probability of an elementary reaction is enhanced in latter case due to a large number of interactions .    in the present notes we shall discuss possible consequences of the very existence of these three suggested hypothetical states ( @xmath16 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) for the nuclear systems . in order to make our analysis more transparent , we consider the lightest state in the dibaryon spectrum , @xmath29  mev , and the two lightest states in the nucleon spectrum @xmath30  mev and @xmath31  mev .",
    "for `` light pions '' we take @xmath32  mev .",
