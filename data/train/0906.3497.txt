    "since it is pseudoscalar , the emission of a pion from a nucleon also leads to a nontrivial redistribution of the spin and angular momentum of its quark constituents @xcite , which partially resolves the proton spin problem @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been established from the chiral expansion in qcd that pion cloud contributions to moments of twist - two parton distributions of the nucleon have a leading nonanalytic ( lna ) behavior characteristic of goldstone boson loops in chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",

    "historically the realization of chiral symmetry on the light - front has posed a serious theoretical challenge , and extreme care must usually be taken to avoid pathologies associated with so - called zero modes or spurious end - point singularities in light - front calculations . indeed , the lna behavior of twist - two matrix elements calculated in the meson cloud model on the light - front ( or in the imf in equal - time quantization ) with a pseudoscalar @xmath5 interaction @xcite appeared to be in conflict with the results from covariant chiral perturbation theory @xcite , which uses a pseudovector coupling .",

    "however , as also in the imf calculation , care needs to be taken to correctly include contributions from end - point regions corresponding to pion light - front momentum fractions equal to 0 or 1 .    we define four - momenta on the light - front as @xmath157 , with the plus / minus components @xmath158 .",

    "thus , for the region @xmath163 or @xmath164 , where both poles of @xmath8 are located either in the lower or upper half plane , respectively , the integral of @xmath46 vanishes .",
    "consequently , only the region @xmath165 contributes to the integration .",

    "not only does the position of the pole depend on the sign of @xmath9 , but also the pole moves to infinity as @xmath169 , changing the degree of divergence of the @xmath8 integral from logarithmic to linear . at the point",
    "@xmath10 the @xmath8 integral is linearly divergent , not logarithmically divergent as one would naively expect from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dn_lf ] ) for the @xmath170 and @xmath171 regions .",

    "( [ eq : sigmalfdef ] ) gives the total light - front self - energy @xmath177 the nonanalytic part of @xmath178 is identical to the results of the covariant and equal - time ( rest frame and imf ) calculations , @xmath179 demonstrating the equivalence of the light - front formalisms to the equal time and covariant formulations .",
    "we have demonstrated the equivalence of the covariant , equal - time ( both in the rest frame and the imf ) , and light - front formalisms in computing the renormalization of the bare nucleon by pion loops . as a specific example",
    ", we have focussed on the self - energy of the nucleon , which finds applications in computations of pion cloud corrections to deep inelastic structure functions , form factors , and other observables .",
    "while this equivalence is expected , it has not to our knowledge been demonstrated explicitly in the literature .",
    "the calculations involve some non - trivial aspects , especially in the imf and lf formulations , which require special care when dealing with end - point singularities , corresponding to momentum fractions approaching 0 or 1 .",
    "we focused on the chirally preferred case of pseudovector coupling , although the comparison with pseudoscalar coupling ( discussed in appendix  [ app : ps ] ) , which was employed in the classical work of drell , levy and yan ( dly ) , reveals several interesting features .",
    "the leading nonanalytic behavior of the self - energy in the latter case is incorrect , with a term behaving as @xmath180 .",
    "in addition , whereas in the pseudovector case the scalar and vector pieces are equal and have the same lna behavior , in the pseudoscalar theory they have even lower order ( incorrect ) nonanalytic terms of order @xmath17 , which cancel in the full combination @xmath181 . finally , we note that the technical problems encountered by dly , with critical contributions from the regions @xmath182 and @xmath183 , are peculiar to the pseudoscalar case in the light - front formalism .",
    "there are a number of applications of the methodology developed here which will be important to pursue in future . as well as the lna behavior of the vertex renormalization , @xmath184 , it is important to compute the lna behavior of the moments of the twist - two parton distribution functions .",
    "in particular , one will be able to explore within the lf formalism the results obtained by dly @xcite in the imf , as well as the application to this problem of effective field theory @xcite .",
    "this should permit a satisfactory resolution of the discrepancy between the results of imf and rest frame equal - time calculations cited by chen and ji  @xcite .",
    "it will also pave the way for a consistent interpretation of the physics of the pion cloud at the partonic level and for the development of realistic chiral models of hadron structure on the lf suitable for discussing form factors , parton distribution functions and gpds .",

    "although the pseudoscalar lagrangian is not invariant under chiral transformations without the introduction of a scalar field ( as in the linear sigma model , for example @xcite ) , since this theory is often discussed in the literature , for completeness we discuss here the results for the ps theory .",
    "this also allows us to contrast a number of important features pertinent to the pseudovector and pseudoscalar calculations .",
    "the lowest order lagrangian density for a ps @xmath5 interaction relevant for the self - energy is given by @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the ps coupling constant . for on - shell nucleons obeying the free dirac equation the ps and pv lagrangians ( see eq .",

    "the ps and pv interactions lead to different results . however , the couplings @xmath18 and @xmath20 are still related through eq .",

    "[ fig : ps ] , where the self - energy now contains contributions from a scalar nucleon self - energy and a nucleon tadpole diagram , as in the pv theory , as well as a pion tadpole term .",

    "( [ eq : sigmaps2 ] ) .",
    "the result of the covariant calculation of the full self - energy @xmath190 using dimensional regularization is @xmath191 expanding in powers of @xmath17 , the leading nonanalytic behavior of the self - energy in the ps theory is given by @xmath192 here the @xmath68 term is identical to the leading term in the pv self - energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmalnapv ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising since the @xmath193 term in the integrand , which produces the @xmath194 behavior , is common to both the pv and ps self - energies .",
    "however , the presence of the pion tadpole in @xmath190 ( arising from the @xmath195 term in the integrand ) leads to an additional contribution proportional to @xmath196 , which is of lower order than the @xmath194 term .    moreover , if we consider the leading nonanalytic behavior of the vector and scalar parts separately , @xmath197\\ ,           \\\\ \\sigma^{\\rm ps}_{s , \\rm lna } & = & -{3 g_a^2 \\over 32 \\pi f_\\pi^2 } \\left [ 2m^2 m_\\pi       + { m \\over \\pi } m_\\pi^2 \\log",

    "while these terms cancel in the total @xmath201 , this demonstrates that the lna behavior of @xmath190 is very different to that for the pv theory .    using the original formulation as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmaps1 ] ) , drell , levy and yan @xcite computed the mass shift in the imf formulation , finding that the entire contribution arises from the infinitesimal end - point regions @xmath154 and @xmath155 for the positive energy and @xmath202-graph contributions , respectively .",
    "moreover , the two terms separately diverge as @xmath132 or @xmath203 , but the sum of the two becomes independent of @xmath131 and @xmath204 . while the results are ultimately the same , this illustrates the fact that the original formulation ( [ eq : sigmaps1 ] ) leads to a somewhat more tortuous path , at least in the imf ( and light - front ) treatments than with the reduced form ( [ eq : sigmaps2 ] ) .",
    "in this appendix we summarize the leading nonanalytic behavior of various integrals which enter into calculations of the self - energy in the pv and ps theories .",
    "the relevant integrands are ones which involve a product of pion and nucleon propagators , one pion propagator ( for the pion tadpole diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : pv ] ) , or one nucleon propagator ( for the nucleon tadpole diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig : pv ] and [ fig : ps ] ) .    for the product of pion and nucleon propagators ,",
    "one finds leading terms of order @xmath17 and @xmath196 , @xmath205 the pion tadpole diagram involves the integral over a single pion propagator , and contributes to the nonanalytic behavior only at a higher order , @xmath206 note that there are no higher order contributions in @xmath17 for this term .",
    "finally , since it is independent of the pion mass , integrals involving nucleon propagators only will give zero nonanalytic contributions , @xmath207 for any power @xmath208 .",
