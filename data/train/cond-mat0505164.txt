    "transport phenomena in mesoscopic superconductor - normal metal ( s - n ) structures have attracted a great interest in last years ( see for example reviews @xcite and references therein ) . due to the proximity effect ( pe ) such properties of the normal metal n as the density - of - states etc",
    "are changed , and therefore transport properties of s - n structures are changed as well .",
    "for example , the resistance of a normal wire a part of which is a segment of a superconducting loop is a periodic function of a magnetic flux @xmath0 threading this loop . the period of the oscillations is the magnetic flux quantum @xmath1 the amplitude of the resistance oscillations @xmath2 depends on temperature @xmath3 in a non - monotonic way reaching a maximum at @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a numerical factor and @xmath6 is the thouless energy @xcite .",
    "a lot of publications are devoted to the study of the electric conductance of s - n mesoscopic structures .",
    "much less attention was paid to the study of thermoelectric phenomena in such structures .",
    "however the situation has changed recently .",
    "a number of papers has been published in which the results of both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies are presented .",
    "it has been established experimentally that the thermoemf @xmath7 in a s - n structure with a superconducting loop also is an oscillating function of the magnetic flux in the loop and the amplitude of oscillations depends on temperature in a non - monotonic way @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the thermoconductance in s - n mesoscopic structures was calculated and measured .",
    "these calculations generalized the results for the thermoconductivity in superconductors in the intermediate state obtained by andreev a long time ago @xcite .",
    "the thermoelectric effects in superconductors caused by the thermoelectric component @xmath8  in the quasiparticle current @xmath9 were considered in many papers starting from the ginzburg paper @xcite ( for more references see @xcite ) .",
    "these effects in a short bridge between two superconductors were studied recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors established that due to a charge imbalance the thermoemf in the superconducting state may be comparable with that in the normal state .",
    "the thermoemf @xmath7 induced in mesoscopic s - n structures with normal reservoirs kept at different temperatures was theoretically studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . using a scattering matrix approach , claughton and lambert @xcite studied the dependence of the thermoelectric voltage on the phase difference @xmath10 between the superconductors s taking into account the thermoelectric current @xmath8 .",
    "they showed that this dependence is periodic .    unlike ref.@xcite in refs .",
    "@xcite the thermoelectric current @xmath11 was completely neglected because the thermoelectric coefficient @xmath12 contains a small parameter : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the fermi energy .",
    "it was shown that even in the absence of the thermoelectric current @xmath11 a temperature gradient in the n wire leads to the build - up of a thermoelectric voltage @xmath7 if the n wire is in contact with two superconductors and the phase difference @xmath10 between the superconductors is not zero .",
    "the voltage @xmath7 in the s - n structure may be of the order @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the temperature of the right ( left ) normal reservoir ( see fig.1 ) , @xmath18 is a numerical factor ( in the case under consideration @xmath19 ) .",
    "therefore the thermoemf @xmath20 below @xmath21 is much larger than the ordinary thermoemf  @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) above the critical temperature @xmath24 .",
    "this effect can be called a giant thermoelectric effect in s - n mesoscopic structures .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the voltage @xmath7 oscillates with increasing the phase difference : @xmath25 , that is , the function @xmath26 is shifted by @xmath27 with respect to the phase dependence of the resistance variation @xmath28 of the normal wire : @xmath29 .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations  @xmath30 is a non - monotonic function of temperature with a maximum at a temperature @xmath31 of the order of the thoulless energy @xmath32 these results are obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite on the basis of microscopic equations for the quasiclassical green s functions .",
    "it was assumed that the s - n interface transmittance is low ( due to a mismatch of the fermi surfaces or to the presence of a potential barrier ) and therefore the pe is weak . in this case",
    "the problem can be solved analytically .",
    "another limit of perfect s - n interfaces was considered in ref.@xcite by using the same microscopic equations .",
    "solutions for these ( kinetic and usadel ) equations were found in ref.@xcite numerically and the obtained results are similar to those found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the theoretical publications @xcite the physics of this giant thermoelectric effect",
    "is explained in terms of the temperature - dependent josephson current which , in the presence of a temperature gradient , has different values at different s - n interfaces . in order to compensate this difference ,",
    "a quasiparticle current driven by the voltage @xmath7 arises in the system .",
    "an approximate formula for the thermoemf was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where in the main approximation the voltage @xmath7  is expressed in terms of the josephson critical current @xmath33 .",
    "a correction to this expression for the voltage @xmath7  is small .",
    "although in some limiting cases the representation of @xmath7 through @xmath33 is possible ( the authors assumed that the order parameter @xmath34  is much larger than the thouless energy @xmath35 ) , in a general case this can not be done .",
    "the point is that the josephson current is a thermodynamical quantity ( it can be presented as a derivative of a free energy with respect to the phase difference ) , whereas the voltage @xmath7 is not . to make this point quite clear",
    ", one can consider a limiting case of temperatures @xmath3 larger than @xmath36 ( to be more exact , the ratio @xmath37 should be much larger than 1 ) . in this case",
    "the josephson current is exponentially small and the josephson coupling is negligible .",
    "however , generally speaking , the voltage @xmath7 is not exponentially small .",
    "its value is determined by the ratio of other parameters : @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to consider the case when the josephson current is small , but the thermoelectric effect is not small in comparison with its maximal value .",
    "we will show that if the ratio @xmath37 is large , the josephson coupling between superconductors is almost negligible , but the thermoemf @xmath7 is not small and can be measured .",
    "in this case one can say about a long - range thermoelectric effects .",
    "as in refs.@xcite , we consider a system shown schematically in the inset of fig .",
    "3 . a normal wire n , or a thin film with a width narrower than the coherence length  @xmath38 connects two normal reservoirs n@xmath39 .",
    "the left reservoir n@xmath40 is kept at a temperature @xmath3 and the right reservoir n@xmath41 has a temperature @xmath42 .",
    "we assume that the s - n interface resistance @xmath43 is larger than the resistance @xmath44 of the n wire so that the ratio @xmath45 is a small parameter . in this case",
    "the problem allows an analytic solution because there is a small parameter , the amplitude of the condensate function @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the retarded ( advanced )  quasiclassical green s function induced in the n wire due to the pe .",
    "therefore the pe is assumed to be weak and the characteristics of the n wire deviate only slightly from those in the normal state .",
    "the thermoemf @xmath7 arising in the system at @xmath48 is an integral over energies @xmath49 from a distribution function @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "this distribution function called a transverse part of the distribution function in ref .",
    "@xcite and denoted by @xmath51 in ref .",
    "@xcite is a difference between electron- and hole - like excitations : @xmath52(see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this function determines the voltage and is related to a so - called charge - imbalance @xcite .",
    "another distribution function @xmath53  determines , for example , the supercurrent and the order parameter ( in the superconductor ) .",
    "these distribution functions obey kinetic equations @xcite .",
    "the kinetic equations were applied to the study of transport properties of mesoscopic s / n structures @xcite*. * the function @xmath54 obeys a kinetic equation , which being written in notations of ref .",
    "@xcite has the form    @xmath55    where all the coefficients are expressed  in terms of the retarded ( advanced ) green s functions : @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58is an anomalous current , and the notation @xmath59 means @xmath60 the function @xmath61 determines the josephson current and can be expressed through the values of @xmath62 at the s / n interface    @xmath63    the green s functions @xmath64 in the superconductors s are not disturbed by the pe due to a low s / n interface transmittance , and therefore in the right superconductor , they are equal to    @xmath65\\delta /\\xi _ { \\epsilon } ^{r(a ) }   \\label{f_s}\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 ; a phenomenological parameter @xmath67 describes a damping in the superconductors ; the matrices @xmath64 in the left superconductor have the same form if one makes a replacement : @xmath68 .",

    "the partial total current @xmath71 is constant over each separate piece of the n wire .",
    "since the  currents@xmath61 and @xmath72 are proportional to small parameters @xmath73 the distribution function @xmath74 ( longitudinal in terms of ref.@xcite ) may be taken in zero order approximation , that is , equal to its value in the absence of the pe .",

    "the voltages @xmath80 are found from the condition of the absence of the total current through the n reservoirs ( the condition of a disconnected circuit ) .",

    "we choose the value of @xmath166 equal to : @xmath167 ( note that the curves for smaller @xmath166 , @xmath166 @xmath168 are similar to those plotted in fig.1 and 2 ) .",
    "we set @xmath169  for the data in fig.1 and @xmath170  for the data in fig.2 .",
    "note that the damping parameter @xmath67  may essentially exceed the corresponding value in bulk superconductors because the pe leads to an additional damping of the order of @xmath171 , where @xmath172  is a parameter which depends on geometry of the s and n films .",
    "we see that in both figures the critical current decays to zero smoothly and fast ( faster than exponentially ) when the temperature @xmath3 increases , but the magnitude of @xmath173 decreases not so fast .",
    "close to the critical temperature @xmath24 the critical current is very small in comparison with @xmath174 , whereas the normalized thermoemf is not so small .",
    "= 8 cm    although the value of @xmath175 is much smaller than @xmath164 , it depends on temperature quite differently being very small at low @xmath176 and having a maximum at a temperature near @xmath177 we represent the temperature dependence of @xmath178 in fig.3 . as we mentioned before",
    ", the voltage @xmath179 is very small at low temperatures @xmath3 because the function @xmath180 is zero at @xmath90 and grows for @xmath181 . at @xmath182",
    "this voltage as well as @xmath108 turns to zero .",
    "therefore , for some parameters the voltages @xmath183 may have two maxima ( or extrema ) : one at low @xmath3 , where @xmath108 has a maximum , and another one at a temperature close to @xmath184 where @xmath107 has a maximum .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a possible assymetry of the system ( for example , different distances between the crossing point and the left and right n reservoirs ) may increase the voltage @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "in fig.4 and 5 we plot the temperature dependence @xmath185 for the damping parameters @xmath186 and @xmath187 one can see that this dependence has two maxima .",
    "the resistance of a s / n system has a similar temperature dependence with two maxima @xcite .",
    "moreover , for @xmath188 the thermoemf drops to zero at a certain temperature , remains very small at larger @xmath3 and increases again at temperatures close to @xmath24 . at @xmath182",
    "the thermoemf drops to zero .",
    "a similar dependence of the thermoemf @xmath189 as a function of the magnitude of the dc heater current was observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "note that the voltage @xmath190  of the left cool n reservoir ( see fig.6 ) has the second maximum near @xmath24  the sign of which is opposite to the sign of the first maximum .",
    "such a behaviour was observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "obviously the average temperature in the n wire ( or film ) is proportional to the magnitude of the heater current .",
    "thus one can say about a qualitative agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "it is difficult to carry out more precise comparison because the pe in the experiment seems to be strong .",
    "perhaps , the strong pe is the reason for a high value of the second maximum of @xmath189 near @xmath24 ( in the experiment , it is comparable with the value of the first maximum at low @xmath3 ) because it is proportional to the parameter @xmath191    = 8 cm    = 8 cm    we assumed that the parameter @xmath166 is small ; however in the case of a strong pe this parameter should be taken of the order of 1 because the condensate functions @xmath47 in the n film saturate with increasing @xmath192 .",
    "finally we give some estimations for parameters close to the experimental ones @xcite : for @xmath193 and @xmath194 , one has @xmath195 this value of @xmath196 is a little larger than @xmath197 ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "the estimations of the thermoemf give the values @xmath199 .",
    "these values are comparable with the voltage @xmath7 observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but much larger than @xmath7 measured in refs . @xcite * ( * note that in refs.@xcite the voltage @xmath200  but not @xmath108  was measured ; in the case @xmath201  the magnitudes of both voltages are comparable ) .",
    "perhaps the reason for this discrepancy is the energy relaxation processes in the n wire which were neglected in our calculations .",
    "indeed , in order to neglect the inelastic scattering the condition @xmath202  should be fulfilled , where @xmath203is the inelastic scattering rate .",
    "otherwise in the system arises a strong depairing which suppresses the pe and destroys the phase coherent effects discussed above .",
    "the more exact comparision with experimental data is not possible at this stage ; for example , a thermoemf symmetric with respect to the phase difference @xmath10 was observed in experiments .",
    "the origin of this part of thermoemf stll is unclear .",
    "in conclusion , we show that the thermoemf arising in the four - terminal s / n structure ( see inset in fig.2 ) is measurable even in the case of  a very weak josephson coupling .",
    "one can say about a long - range thermoemf .",
    "the thermoemf @xmath204 ( or thermopower @xmath205 ) depends on @xmath3 in a non - monotonic way and may have two extrema : one at low temperatures and another at temperatures close to @xmath24 . at some values of parameters and intermediate temperatures",
    "the thermoelectric voltage is negligible .",
    "this behavior qualitatively agrees with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "note that the density - of - states in the superconductors @xmath206 is dropped in the expression for @xmath108 in ref .",
