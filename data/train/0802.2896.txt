    "experiments on solar and atmospheric neutrinos have demonstrated that neutrinos have non - zero masses and mixing angles @xcite .",

    "many models have been proposed , which potentially can explain these data .",
    "certainly the most popular are variants based on the see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , the classical seesaw mechanism puts the scale of lepton number violation near the grand unification scale and , therefore , can not be directly tested .",
    "indirect tests of the seesaw might be possible , if low - scale supersymmetry is realized in nature @xcite .",
    "measurements of masses and branching ratios of supersymmetric particles can be used to obtain indirect information on the range of allowed seesaw parameters , if some specific scenarios for the soft - breaking parameters are assumed @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a number of neutrino mass models exist , in which neutrino masses are generated at the electro - weak scale .",
    "examples include the babu - zee model @xcite , leptoquarks @xcite or in case of supersymmetry the breaking of r - parity @xcite .",
    "these low energy models usually lead to testable predictions for future colliders .",
    "for example , in the case of r - parity violation ( ) , in particular for models based on bilinear r - parity breaking terms @xcite , correlations between certain branching ratios of the lightest supersymmetric particle decays and the measured neutrino mixing angles have been found @xcite .    in the _ neutralino _ as a dark matter candidate is lost .",
    "recent wmap data @xcite , however , have confirmed the existence of non - baryonic dark matter and measured its contribution to the energy budget of the universe with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "thus , in one needs a non - standard explanation of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "examples for dm candidates in include ( i ) light gravitinos @xcite , ( ii ) the axion @xcite or ( iii ) its superpartner , the axino @xcite , to mention a few .    whether r - parity is conserved or not can , in principle , be easily decided in the case of explicit r - parity violation since ( a ) neutrino physics implies that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) will decay inside a typical detector of existing and future high energy experiments @xcite and ( b ) the branching fraction for ( completely ) invisible lsp decays is at most @xmath0 and typically smaller@xcite . _ spontaneous _ violation of r - parity ( s- ) @xcite , on the other hand , implies the existence of a goldstone boson , the majoron ( j ) .",
    "in s- the lightest neutralino can then decay according to @xmath1 , i.e.  completely invisible .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this decay mode can in fact be the dominant one , with branching ratios close to 100 % , despite the smallness of neutrino masses , in case the scale of r - parity breaking is relatively low . in this limit",
    ", the accelerator phenomenology of models with spontaneous violation of r - parity can resemble the mssm with conserved r - parity and large statistics might be necessary before it can be established that r - parity indeed is broken .",
    "in this paper we study scenarios where the lightest neutralino is the lsp focusing on two representative examples : ( i ) a bino - like lsp as this case has been extensively studied in the literature , both in case of conserved r - parity as well as ( explicitly ) broken r - parity .",
    "we will re - iterate our previous result @xcite that there are regions in parameter space , where it will be difficult to obtain clarity about the underlying model in the first years of lhc .",
    "we will also discuss , how measurements of branching ratios can lead to tests of the model as the origin of the neutrino mass , in case sufficient statistics for the final states with charged leptons can be obtained .",
    "( ii ) a singlino - like lsp .",
    "this case has not been studied in the past but it is the only part of the allowed parameter space where singlinos can be produced and studied at future accelerators . in addition , this case allows interesting cross - checks with respect to neutrino physics different from a bino lsp .",
