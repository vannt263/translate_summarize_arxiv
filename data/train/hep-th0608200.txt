    "at present , inflation is the only well established mechanism which solves the homogeneity , isotropy , flatness and horizon problems , and explains why the universe has such a large mass and entropy . in addition , it provides a simple mechanism of generation of metric perturbations of with a flat spectrum , as required for the formation of large - scale structure of the universe . for a review of inflationary theory and the theory of perturbations of metric there",
    "see e.g. @xcite .    there were many attempts to suggest an alternative solution to the major cosmological problems , but so far the progress in this direction was quite limited .",
    "for example , the pre - big bang scenario @xcite and the ekpyrotic / cyclic scenario @xcite are based on the assumption that eventually one will find a solution of the cosmological singularity problem and learn how one could transfer small perturbations of metric through the singularity .",
    "this problem , as well as several other problems discussed in @xcite , still remain unsolved .",
    "an alternative explanation of the origin of cosmological perturbations was advocated in @xcite .",
    "the mechanism was based on the alternation of the qft rules .",
    "however this mechanism does not address any other cosmological problems , and it relies on speculations about dynamics of perturbations at an epoch when the energy density was @xmath1 times greater than the planck density @xcite . in comparison , inflation solves the major cosmological problems and produces metric perturbations with a flat spectrum practically independently of the speculative processes at extremely high energies and large curvatures , or before the big bang .",
    "in a recent series of papers @xcite it was claimed that after a certain modification of the string theory inspired cosmological model proposed in @xcite one can obtain scale free cosmological perturbations of metric due to the physical processes _ after _ the big bang .",
    "this could be advantageous over the pre - big bang and the ekpyrotic / cyclic scenario , because in those models the cosmological perturbations are produced _ before _ the big bang , making the corresponding conclusions unreliable .",
    "the authors of @xcite admitted that their model does not solve the flatness problem and has several other unexplained features .",
    "thus it is not a real alternative to inflation",
    ". nevertheless it would be quite interesting to have a non - inflationary mechanism of production of perturbations of metric with a flat spectrum .",
    "our goal here is to examine this issue .    in section 2",
    "we will go over some of the properties and unsolved problems of the basic cosmological model of @xcite . in section 3",
    "we will argue that the spectrum of scalar perturbations produced in this model is dramatically tilted . instead of the scale - free spectrum with the spectral index @xmath2 ,",
    "the perturbations produced in the model of @xcite have blue spectrum with the spectral index @xmath0 , disagreeing with the cosmological data .",
    "the main problem with the proposal of @xcite stems from the fact that they worked in the string frame , but directly employed the standard description of metric perturbations @xcite tailored for the einstein frame .",
    "meanwhile , due to a nontrivial dilaton dynamics these two frames strongly differ from each other at the epoch when the perturbations of metric were produced . in section 4",
    "we will show that a similar conclusion is valid for the tensor perturbations of metric as well ( though for a different reason ) : the spectrum of the gravitational waves produced in their scenario is far from being flat .",
    "the cosmological scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite is based in part on the cosmological solution obtained by vafa and tseytlin @xcite .",
    "this solution describes an @xmath3-dimensional universe in the context of the effective dilaton gravity theory with the action [ action ] s = 12 d^n+1x    e^-2 ( r - 4(d)^2 ) . here",

    "in addition to the gravitational degrees of freedom of action eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xcite also include the contribution of a gas of strings following its thermodynamic description explained in @xcite .",
    "an important role is purportedly played by winding modes of strings and p - branes , as discussed , e.g. , in @xcite    the string frame metric ds^2_s = dt^2 -a^2(t ) d^2x , is related to the einstein frame metric by a conformal transformation [ eframe ] ds^2_e = ( -4n-1 ) ds^2_s = d^2 -^2 ( ) d^2x  .",
    "one should emphasize that once one replaces string theory by the effective action for metric and the dilaton field of the type of ( [ action ] ) , as was done in @xcite , all calculations can be equally well performed either in the string frame , or in the einstein frame , where the standard einstein equations are valid .",
    "the final results describing physical quantities should be equivalent , independently of the frame used to compute them in , as long as the correct conformal transformation rules are used on the metric and throughout the matter sector , including any possible @xmath8 regulators . in other words ,",
    "the domain of validity of the einstein frame and einstein equations coincides with the domain of validity of the effective string theory action ( [ action ] ) .    usually string theory calculations",
    "are performed in the string frame @xcite .",
    "an important convenience of the einstein frame is that the gravitational part of the effective action ( [ action ] ) in this frame looks like the standard einstein action with the time - independent gravitational constant .",
    "the methodology and physical picture for the investigation of metric perturbations has been originally developed in the einstein frame , where one can use the standard , simple einstein equations .",
    "when the dilaton is constant , the two frames coincide with each other , up to an overall normalization coefficient .",
    "however , in general , the dilaton is not constant , and can sometimes lead to an apparition of a profoundly different picture of cosmological evolution as seen from these two frames . yet , however , as we have already stressed above , the differences are only apparent , since the physical quantities remain independent of the conformal frame .",
    "consider , for example , the only explicit cosmological solution obtained in @xcite ( the last equation in the appendix ) .",

    "one might at first wonder how something like this could ever happen , because the usual einstein equations for a flat universe imply [ einst ] h_e^2 = 3 m_p^2 , where @xmath25 is the einstein frame hubble constant .",
    "thus the universe can be static only if density of matter vanishes , which is not the case considered in @xcite .",
    "however equations in @xcite have been solved in string frame , where they look quite different from the einstein equation ( [ einst ] ) due to the nontrivial dilaton behavior .",
    "interestingly , in the einstein frame the same cosmological evolution looks not as a cosmological expansion ( [ scale ] ) , but rather as a _ gravitational collapse_. one can easily show that whereas the size of the universe @xmath12 in the string frame _ grows _ , the same size measured in units of @xmath26 , i.e. the scale factor in the einstein frame @xmath27 , _ decreases _ : ~|t|^2/(n-1)~||^2/(n+1 ) , where @xmath28 the einstein frame time , as defined in eq .",

    "this example vividly illustrates why one should be extremely careful with specifying the particular frame used in the investigation of string cosmology .",
    "while the results of the calculations in each frame are of course physically equivalent , one may run into all kinds of paradoxical conclusions by directly applying equations valid in one frame to another frame .",
    "in particular , one should not use the einstein equations for the description of dynamics in the string frame .",
    "meanwhile , as we will see , this is exactly what was done in the computation of cosmological perturbations in @xcite , where no distinction between these two frames was made .",
    "we should stress a fact that will be crucial for us in what follows .",
    "the transition between @xmath12 and @xmath27 is achieved by the simple rescaling corresponding to the change of units of length from string units to the planck units : [ scalefacts ] = e^-2n-1 a = m_pm_s a .",

    "@xcite consider a different possibility and assume that only three dimensions are expanding , while the others are stabilized .",
    "this assumption was intensely debated in the literature on string gas cosmology .",
    "a detailed investigation of @xcite found no support for this hypothesis . recently a novel mechanism to address this problem",
    "was proposed , involving @xmath31 flux in unwrapped dimensions @xcite , but this mechanism relies on the dilaton stabilization , which is another as yet unsolved problem of this scenario , see below .",
    "\\2 ) the three expanding dimensions are supposed to be extremely large from the very beginning , of a size greater than @xmath32 in string units .",
    "it is not quite clear how this could be related to the original ideas of the t - dual description of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the initial size of all dimensions was supposed to be @xmath33 in string units .",
    "the authors acknowledge this as a manifestation of the flatness problem of their new scenario .",
    "this problem is more general , however , because the general asymmetric and anisotropic initial data generally will not evolve towards the homogeneous and isotropic initial state needed for @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) in addition to the flatness problem , one should also solve the homogeneity problem . a mechanism addressing this problem",
    "was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it was based on the introduction of a specific potential between two orbifold fixed planes .",
    "such potential does not follow from string theory , and the authors acknowledged that this proposal is extremely speculative @xcite . on the other hand , a slight modification of one of the assumptions of ref .",
    "@xcite leads to inflation @xcite , which makes alternative mechanisms of generation of perturbations of metric unnecessary .",
    "\\4 ) just like the tseytlin - vafa solution @xcite described above , the scenario of @xcite is based on the assumption that initially the universe was static , so that the size of the horizon @xmath34 was infinite .",
    "however , by the word `` initially '' the authors of @xcite do not mean @xmath23 . instead , they either simply assume , without providing specific details , that at some intermediate stage of expansion the universe was static but slowly accelerating , or mention a specific loitering regime @xcite when the universe , according to @xcite , should have experienced several stages of expansion and contraction , in the string frame .",
    "the `` initial '' static universe in the loitering regime should correspond to the last bounce , after which the universe should switch to a more regular stage of expansion .",
    "dynamics of the loitering regime begs for an additional investigation .",
    "in particular , according to @xcite , the transition from the loitering phase should lead to a singular behavior of all fields , unless the dilaton field is stabilized by the dilaton potential @xmath35 , which should survive even at the present stage of the evolution of the universe .",
    "most importantly , stabilization of the dilaton , as well as of many other string theory moduli fields , is necessitated by particle phenomenology and by the theory of gravitational interactions , specifically by the equivalence principle tests , in order to yield acceptable low energy limits which conform with observations .",
    "the problem of stabilizing the dilaton and other string theory moduli was studied extensively for the last 20 years , but it proved to be extremely complicated .",
    "a possible solution to this problem was proposed only very recently , in the context of the kklt construction @xcite .",
    "however , this construction involves many additional ingredients , such as branes , fluxes etc . , which are not a part of the model considered in @xcite .",
    "\\5 ) the scenario of @xcite assumes the existence of a thermal equilibrium in the hagedorn phase .",
    "an investigation of this issue in @xcite suggests that no such equilibrium can be maintained .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in @xcite , where it was argued that the dilaton stabilization by a hypothetical dilaton potential is required for solving this problem .",
    "but if the dilaton is stabilized during the hagedorn phase , this completely invalidates the mechanism of generation of density perturbations proposed in @xcite : this mechanism is based on the rapid shrinking of the hubble radius @xmath36 . in the models with the stabilized dilaton , this assumption contradicts the null energy condition , see sections [ para ] .",
    "the absence of many essential ingredients makes it rather difficult to discuss the evolution of the universe and generation of cosmological perturbations in the scenario of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we will try to follow the logic of refs .",
    "@xcite , keeping all of our reservations in mind .",
    "we will attempt to evaluate whether this scenario , if it can work despite all of the problems discussed above , may provide a new mechanism of generation of scale invariant metric perturbations .",
    "perhaps the simplest way to grasp the main idea of the mechanism of generation of metric perturbations @xcite is to use the figure given in @xcite , see fig . 1 of our paper",
    ". we added to their figure only one line , db ( dashed green line ) .",
    "according to @xcite , this line , combined with the line bc , describes the evolution of the hubble horizon @xmath37 in the einstein frame .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the the relevant cosmological evolution described by this scenario is taken to begin not at @xmath38 , but at some intermediate stage , when the universe was static and the size of the hubble radius in the string frame @xmath39 was infinite .",
    "then the universe begins to expand , and @xmath39 starts to shrink .",
    "the last stage of the shrinking , shown by the line ab , describes the evolution of the quasi - static hagedorn regime into the radiation - dominated phase of standard cosmology . according to @xcite ,",
    "this transition is supposed to occur very quickly ; within a finite time the size of the hubble radius should shrink from an infinite value to @xmath40 . the main idea of ref .",
    "@xcite is that when the hubble radius @xmath36 becomes smaller than the wavelength of perturbations of metric created by thermal fluctuations inside the horizon , these perturbations freeze , just like the metric perturbations do during inflation .",
    "= 3.7 in    to describe this effect , one can use the longitudinal gauge , where the perturbed metric takes the form [ long ] ds^2 = - ( 1 + 2 ) dt^2 + a^2(t ) ( 1 - 2 ) d*x*^2 . here",
    "@xmath41 represents the fluctuation mode .",
    "the spectral index @xmath42 of the cosmological perturbations is determined by [ spectrum ] p_(k ) k^3 |(k)|^2 ~k^n - 1 . here",
    "@xmath43 is the fourier coefficient of @xmath44 and @xmath45 denotes the dimensionless power spectrum of some quantity @xmath46 .",

    "et al _ calculate the amplitude of thermodynamical fluctuations of the energy density @xmath47 in the hagedorn regime , and relate these perturbations to the metric perturbation @xmath44 via the einstein constraint equation [ constr ] ^2 = 4 g .",
    "recall again that the standard einstein equations are valid only in the einstein frame .",
    "furthermore , this particular equation is valid only for the sub - horizon perturbations with wavelengths @xmath48 .",
    "this fact will be important for us later , but for the time being we will ignore this issue and continue along the lines of @xcite .",
    "the calculations of @xcite imply that the spectrum of density perturbations is proportional to @xmath49 : [ blue ] p _",
    "= k^3((k))^2 ~k^4 = k^n_-1 , with @xmath50 . according to @xcite ,",
    "this spectrum becomes transformed to the spectrum of perturbations of metric @xmath44 with flat spectrum , @xmath2 , because the einstein equation ( [ constr ] ) implies that @xmath51 .",
    "their final result for the spectrum of metric fluctuations [ spectrum2 ] p _ ~ 16 ^2 g^2 ^-3/2 , which would imply that the spectrum of metric perturbations _ on scales smaller than the hubble radius _ is approximately scale - invariant , @xmath2",
    ". then one can argue @xcite that these perturbations freeze out in the interval ab , fig .",
    "1 , when the hubble radius @xmath36 becomes smaller than the wavelength of the perturbations @xmath52 changes from some finite value to an infinitely large one , and then becomes finite again .",
    "following the logic of ref .",
    "@xcite one would then have expected that scale - invariant metric perturbations could have been produced not only once , but several times during the history of the universe in the string gas cosmology . ] . according to @xcite , this results in generation of adiabatic perturbations of metric with flat spectrum , without any need of inflation .      at the first glance",
    ", the ideas described in the previous section may seem quite plausible .",
    "however , as we have repeatedly noted , investigation performed in @xcite made no distinction between the string frame and the einstein frame .",
    "on the one hand , the evolution of the universe and the behavior of all thermodynamic quantities have been studied in @xcite in the string frame . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution of density perturbations was studied using the einstein equation ( [ constr ] ) .",
    "this equation is valid only in the einstein frame , for the perturbations with the wavelength smaller than the cosmological horizon evaluated in the einstein frame .",
    "the string frame and the einstein frame do not differ much after the end of the hagedorn phase , at @xmath53 , because the dilaton field at this stage ( line bc ) moves very slowly @xcite .",
    "however the difference between these two frames is very significant during the hagedorn phase @xmath54 , and especially at the transition stage ab ( stage db in the einstein frame ) , when the large - scale perturbations of metric were generated .    with this in mind , let us first examine the assumption that the perturbations of metric freeze when their wavelength becomes greater than the hubble radius .",
    "the immediate question which then arises is , which hubble radius should we compare the perturbation wavelength to ?",
    "the size of the einstein frame cosmological horizon @xmath55 is _ not _ equal to the rescaled value of @xmath36 : h_e^-1 = m_pm_s(h_s- 2n-1)^-1 up to the rescaling factor @xmath56 , the quantities @xmath37 and @xmath36 would coincide for @xmath57 .",
    "however , in the model of @xcite one has @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the ( rescaled ) einstein frame hubble radius is _ smaller _ than the hubble radius in the string frame . in particular , the universe in the einstein frame continues to expand and the horizon @xmath59 remains finite even it appears to stop in the sting frame , when @xmath60 and the string frame hubble radius @xmath36 is infinite .    of course , if @xmath61 is small ( e.g. after the onset of radiation domination , line bc @xcite ) , then , up to the rescaling , there is no much difference between @xmath39 and @xmath55 .",
    "this is shown in fig . 1 by the line bc",
    ". it simultaneously describes @xmath39 and the rescaled horizon @xmath55 , because the rescaling factor @xmath62 remains constant along this line as the dilaton does not move at that time . on the other hand , as we noted above , these two quantities differ a lot during the most important stage ab , where , according to @xcite , the perturbations of metric with the wavelengths greater than hubble radius are supposed to be frozen .    as noted in @xcite , this transition from the hagedorn phase to radiation cosmology",
    "is only partially understood .",
    "investigation of related subjects in @xcite was made without taking into account the evolution of the dilaton and the background metric , which as we saw are quite significant during this stage .",
    "indeed , if the dilaton were frozen during this stage , then there would be no difference between the string frame and the einstein frame , and the size of the horizon could only grow , according to the conventional einstein equations , which yield @xmath63 this quantity can not be positive unless one studies phantom matter with @xmath64 , which violates the null energy condition and typically leads to a catastrophic vacuum instability @xcite .",
    "thus whenever the null energy condition is satisfied , the size of the horizon in the einstein frame can only grow .",
    "this is shown in fig . 1",
    ", in accordance with @xcite . at the stage ab the string frame @xmath39 shrinks , while at the same time @xmath55 expands , as shown by line db .",
    "the difference between these two regimes is possible only because of the rapid dilaton evolution at that time .",
    "it is important to realize that the difference between the rescaled values of @xmath55 and @xmath39 at this stage is extremely large . indeed , according to fig .",
    "1 , the rescaled value of @xmath55 along the line db is smaller than the minimal value @xmath65 on the line ab . on the other hand ,",
    "if we want the perturbations generated during that epoch to describe the present large scale structure of the universe , the value of @xmath39 at the time when the seeds for large - scale perturbations are generated must be exponentially larger than the minimal value of @xmath66 .",
    "thus we are talking about the situation where the difference between the rescaled value of @xmath55 and @xmath39 is _ exponentially _ large .",
    "given such a profound difference between @xmath55 and @xmath39 at the stage when the metric perturbations are generated , one should check exactly when they freeze , and in fact if they freeze at all .",
    "does it happen when their wavelength becomes greater than @xmath55 , or when it becomes greater than @xmath39 ?",
    "freezing of the oscillations is a frame - invariant effect , so one should be able to analyze it in any frame",
    ". however , the exploration of this issue in the string frame is rather complicated because perturbations of the metric interact not only with gravity but also with the dilaton .",
    "moreover , @xmath39 does not have any direct relation to particle horizon , event horizon , or apparent horizon .",
    "for example , when @xmath67 vanishes and @xmath39 becomes infinite , the universe does not instantly become causally connected .",
    "thus , there is no obvious reason to assume that fluctuations should freeze when their wavelength becomes greater than @xmath39 .    fortunately , to resolve this issue one can study freezing out of the the metric perturbations in the einstein frame , and",
    "the answer is well known : the perturbations freeze if their wavelength is greater than the hubble radius in the einstein frame @xmath55 , rather than at the moment when their wavelength becomes greater than @xmath39 , as assumed in @xcite .",
    "but as we just mentioned , the hubble radius in the einstein frame can never shrink , unlike the hubble radius in the string frame . this fact is illustrated by fig .",
    "1 , which shows that while @xmath36 shrinks in the interval ab , the size of the horizon in the einstein frame @xmath55 grows in the corresponding interval db .",
    "since @xmath55 can only grow , unless the null energy condition is violated , one may wonder whether it is at all possible for the perturbations with a given comoving momentum initially greater than the einstein frame hubble scale @xmath68 to go outside the horizon and freeze there ?",
    "the answer to this question is also well known .",
    "if the universe experiences power law expansion @xmath69 with @xmath70 , which is the typical situation in non - inflationary cosmology , then the horizon always expands faster that the wavelengths , @xmath71 , and the sub - horizon fluctuations never freeze . on the other hand ,",
    "if the size of the horizon for a long time practically does not change , then the wavelengths eventually become greater than @xmath55 and the fluctuations can freeze . this is the standard inflationary mechanism .",
    "but the authors @xcite assume that there is no inflation in their scenario .",
    "then we are forced to conclude that no freeze - out of the fluctuations occurs when @xmath36 suddenly shrinks to a very small value along the line ab .",
    "this does not necessarily preclude production of metric perturbations at this time .",
    "indeed , if thermal fluctuations of density exist at that stage , they certainly induce some metric perturbations . however , there are two problems here .",
    "first of all , whereas the long - wavelength perturbations discussed in @xcite were crossing the shrinking radius @xmath36 , their wavelength was always exponentially greater than the horizon @xmath55 , as we just discussed .",
    "it is not obvious to us what mechanism could be responsible for the establishment of the thermal equilibrium between the fluctuations on scales which are exponentially greater than the size of the horizon ; see also general comments about the applicability of thermal description in this regime in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the long - wavelength modes are out of thermal equilibrium , then the calculations of density perturbations performed in @xcite simply can not remain valid at the cosmologically large , super - horizon , scales .    but let us ignore this issue for a moment and assume , following @xcite , that the spectral distribution of density perturbations is @xmath72 with @xmath50 , see eq .",
    "( [ blue ] ) .",
    "as we already mentioned , @xcite assert that this spectrum becomes transformed into the spectrum of metric perturbations @xmath44 with flat spectrum , @xmath2 , because the einstein equation ( [ constr ] ) implies that @xmath51 .",
    "but as it stands , this equation is valid only for perturbations _ with the wavelengths smaller than the horizon @xmath55 _ ( not @xmath39 ! ) .    for the perturbations with the wavelengths greater than the horizon @xmath55 ,",
    "the relation between @xmath44 and @xmath73 in the longitudinal gauge ( [ long ] ) used in @xcite is quite different @xcite : [ outside ] 2(k ) = - ( k ) .",
    "this equation remains true for _ any _ relation between the wavelengths of the perturbations and @xmath39 , as long as these wavelengths are greater than @xmath55 .",
    "thus it is valid for all long - wavelength cosmological perturbations we are interested in , see fig .",
    ". this implies , according to ( [ blue ] ) , that perturbations outside the horizon have the same spectrum as @xmath74 , i.e. instead of the flat spectrum with @xmath2 they have a blue spectrum [ blue2 ] p _ ~k^4 = k^n-1 , which , with the approximations inherent in @xcite , yields @xmath75 , in contrast to their claim that @xmath2 .",
    "this spectrum is ruled out by cosmological observations .",
    "furthermore , suppose , for example , that the amplitude of perturbations of metric and density on the horizon scale @xmath37 is equal to @xmath76 .",
    "one can then easily check using eq .",
    "( [ blue2 ] ) that the relative perturbations of mass @xmath77 on a given scale will become much greater than @xmath33 for @xmath78 .",
    "this means that the perturbation theory used in @xcite can cover no more than 3 orders of magnitude of scale , which is inadequate for describing cosmological perturbations in our universe .    finally , let us note that if thermodynamical equilibrium is somehow maintained during the transition from the hagedorn phase to the radiation - dominated phase of standard cosmology , then the amplitude of perturbations of metric always follows the evolution of the perturbations of density , in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ outside ] ) .",
    "but during this transition , the perturbations of density in the hagedorn phase gradually evolve into the usual thermodynamical perturbations of density in the radiation - dominated universe , which can never produce large scale cosmological perturbations with flat spectrum .",
    "the main difference between this situation and the situation in inflationary cosmology can be explained as follows . in inflationary cosmology",
    "the inflaton field is _ not _ in a state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "its fluctuations are frozen at the time when their wavelength becomes greater than @xmath37 .",
    "these frozen fluctuations serve as a source for the metric fluctuations , which are also frozen in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ outside ] ) .",
    "if we want to have something similar in the string gas scenario , we would need to assume that the large scale perturbations of stringy matter density are frozen .",
    "if this is so , they can not be in thermal equilibrium , because the properties of the universe in thermal equilibrium change dramatically during the transitional period .",
    "on the other hand , if the perturbations are not in thermal equilibrium , then the calculations of their amplitude @xcite are not valid .",
    "if we nevertheless assume that these calculations are valid , then , as we have seen , the resulting metric perturbations have a blue spectrum , with @xmath0 .",
    "either way , we do not obtain scale free cosmological perturbations in this scenario .    does this exhaust all possibilities ?",
    "first of all , until now , we have been operating under the assumption made in @xcite that one can calculate the amplitude of density perturbations in the string frame and then simply plug in the result into the einstein equations .",
    "however , the amplitude of density perturbations in the string frame is different from the amplitude of the perturbations in the einstein frame , where the einstein equations can be used , because of the dilaton contribution .    in the string frame",
    ", one could safely ignore this contribution because in the hagedorn phase the dilaton was just one out of many degrees of freedom contributing to the energy density of the universe .",
    "on the other hand , upon the conformal transformation to the einstein frame , which involves @xmath79 , the dilaton perturbations induce perturbations of the energy density of all other fields . as a result",
    "one finds the following expression relating the amplitude of density perturbations in the einstein frame and in the string frame @xcite : [ dilpert ] ( ) _ e = ( ) _ s + 8 n-1  .",
    "therefore to obtain the amplitude of metric perturbations from the amplitude of perturbations of energy density calculated in the string frame , one should write eq .",
    "( [ outside ] ) more accurately : [ outside2 ] 2(k ) = - ( ) _ e = - ( ) _ s -8 n-1  .",
    "the term @xmath80 was calculated in @xcite and , as we argued above , it produces metric perturbations with blue spectrum , which rapidly disappear in the large scale limit .",
    "if the dilaton perturbations are thermal , then the dilaton contributions to metric perturbations also have a blue spectrum with the amplitude which rapidly disappears at the cosmological scale .",
    "there is only one exception from this rule that we are aware of : if the universe experiences a stage of inflation , and the dilaton field remains very light during inflation , @xmath81 , then the standard inflationary dilaton perturbations with a flat spectrum are produced .",
    "this results in the scale invariant metric perturbations [ outside3 ] ( k ) = -4 n-1  .",
    "this mechanism is equivalent to the mechanism of generation of modulated perturbations of metric developed in @xcite .",
    "however , this mechanism requires inflation .    finally ,",
    "if one is willing to consider even very exotic possibilities to save the scenario of @xcite , one may look more attentively at our main premise that the behavior of the hubble radius in string frame @xmath36 is fundamentally different from the behavior of the hubble radius in the einstein frame @xmath37 , as shown in fig . 1 , lines ab versus db .",
    "what if the dilaton was fixed due to some unspecified nonperturbative processes at that time",
    "? then the universe expanded in the same way in the einstein frame and in the string frame , and @xmath37 decreased in the same way as @xmath36 on line ab .    of course , this would require stabilizing the dilaton not only at the present stage of the evolution of the universe , which was not achieved as yet in the framework of the model studied in @xcite , but also during the hagedorn phase , and during the intermediate phase between the hagedorn regime and the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "we have no idea whether this could be done .",
    "as we have already noted , the decrease of @xmath37 would contradict the null energy condition , which usually implies catastrophic vacuum instability .",
    "with such dramatic nonperturbative changes to the underlying physics , one can only guess what happens to the spectrum of density perturbations calculated in @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the dilaton is fixed at the time when the cosmological perturbations are produced , then one can apply to this situation the no - go theorem proven in @xcite , which says that in this case the inflationary expansion is the only mechanism which can generate cosmological perturbations with a flat spectrum .",
    "interestingly , there is a direct relation between the speculative regime discussed above and inflation .",
    "if one manages to fix the dilaton during the stage ab , when the cosmological metric perturbations are supposed to be generated , then the hubble constants @xmath82 and @xmath67 are proportional to each other , and both of them rapidly grow , so that @xmath83 .",
    "this means that = dh_ed + h_e^2 > 0  , i.e. the universe in the einstein frame is accelerating .",
    "the meaning of this result is very simple .",
    "if @xmath82 is a positive constant , or a slowly changing positive quantity , the universe enters the regime of exponentially rapid accelerated expansion , i.e. inflation . if @xmath82 is positive , and it grows in time , then the rate of acceleration also grows , so we deal with a super - exponential expansion , or super - inflation @xcite . note that we are not talking here about the contracting universe which looks inflationary only in the string frame , which is the case in the pre - big bang scenario . in this case",
    "the universe is super - inflationary both in the string frame and in the einstein frame .",
    "thus , if we find some way to stabilize the dilaton in the hagedorn regime and remove the difference between the string frame and the einstein frame , which is one of the main stumbling blocks of the scenario proposed in @xcite , then we end up in the inflationary universe anyway .",
    "until now we have discussed scalar perturbations of the metric , which play the key role in the cosmological structure formation . in this section",
    "we turn to the generation of gravitational waves , which are tensor perturbations .",
    "we will critically review the derivation of gravitational radiation in the hagedorn thermal bath in the model proposed in @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of gravitational waves radiation from thermal bath is different from that of gravitons production from vacuum in an expanding universe .",
    "gravitational waves perturbing the frw background are the transverse - traceless ( tt ) metric fluctuations @xmath84 , @xmath85 with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "the field equation for gravitational waves is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the tt part of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath91 . in the momentum space",
    "@xmath90 is easily derivable from @xmath92 with the help of the projector operators @xmath93 where the projector operator is @xmath94 if the tt - part of energy - momentum tensor is absent , @xmath95 , then we deal with the free gravity waves .",
    "this happens during inflation , when the gravitational waves are generated from vacuum fluctuations , even in the absence of any source @xmath95 .",
    "instead , let us consider now a simplified case of a static universe filled with matter in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this was the regime studied in @xcite . in this case",
    "gravitational waves can be produced by the source term @xmath90 even if the universe is static .",
    "this mechanism , which is quite different from the inflationary one , deserves a systematic study @xcite .",
    "first , let us recall how this case was treated in @xcite .",
    "it was suggested to use the fourier - component version of the wave equation ( [ motion ] ) , @xmath96 and construct the combination @xmath97 using this equation . here",
    "@xmath98 corresponds to the spatial three - momentum .",
    "however , eq . ( [ mode ] ) is not a full fourier - transform of ( [ motion ] ) .",
    "an important term @xmath99 was dropped from the equation .",
    "( [ mode ] ) used in @xcite is not a correct wave equation for the radiation to be emitted by the sources .    using the spatial fourier - transform @xmath100",
    ", we can readily find the correct version of eq .",
    "( [ mode ] ) . from ( [ motion ] ) we have @xmath101 in a general case of the frw universe one finds a similar equation , rescaling @xmath102 and switching to the conformal time @xmath103 : @xmath104 for gravity waves generated inside the horizon , the term @xmath105 can be omitted .    here",
    "we will only consider the limit of a static universe , in order to compare our results with the conclusion of @xcite .",
    "however , the method of derivation of gravitational radiation from the random media @xcite which we will use is quite general and can easily incorporate other cases , of expanding / contracting universes , and of evolving dilaton .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ kmode1 ] ) is @xmath106 the quantity @xmath107 along the characteristics of the gravitational wave propagation is a random variable .",
    "we can construct the variance of the gravity wave amplitude @xmath108 ) , and involves subtle information about the time correlator @xmath109 , which we can write as @xmath110 let us take here the limit of large @xmath17 . replacing @xmath111 by exponents and dropping rapidly oscillating terms , one can simplify eq .",
    "( [ amplitude ] ) .",
    "formally , the result of the calculations diverges with time , which is expected for infinitely long stationary process of the gravitational waves production . indeed",
    ", nothing will interfere with the gravitational wave production by colliding particles in the thermal gas , until the gravitons come to a state of thermal equilibrium with matter .",
    "the final result for the gravitational wave production rate in a thermal bath is @xmath112 to get an estimate of the spectrum of gravity waves generated in string gas cosmology , we will take the estimate of @xmath113 given in @xcite .",
    "they suggest that |_ij|^2 ^2 , and so |_ij ( k)|^2k ^2 .",
    "the time correlation function of thermal fluctuations @xmath114 should be a decreasing function of time separation . let us suppose that @xmath115 .",
    "then from ( [ rate1 ] ) we obtain the final estimate @xmath116 \\ , \\delta t \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 is the duration of the process .",
    "the meaning of this result is that the gravitational waves are constantly generated as long as we have a thermal bath containing many moving and colliding particles . in an expanding",
    "/ contracting universe @xmath117 should be replaced by the age of the universe @xmath118 .",
    "the spectrum is not scale - free but peaked at the scale of temperature @xmath119 , as expected for the radiation produced by matter in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this shows how to consistently improve the results of ref . @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , these calculations describe production of gravitational waves by thermal fluctuations assuming that the gravitons are out of thermal equilibrium , and yield a spectrum which is not flat . the state of the universe in which our calculation applies simply does nt contain many gravitons .",
    "this is certainly the case at the late stages of the evolution of the universe , but this should not be the case if the initial state was a hagedorn phase in thermal equilibrium . if this equilibrium initial state is possible , then the gravitons are constantly emitted and absorbed , and their spectrum can not be flat .",
    "note that the gravitons correspond to the lowest energy excitations of the closed string loops .",
    "the existence of the hagedorn temperature is a consequence of the existence of a tower of massive states giving large contribution to the total energy density .",
    "when the temperature drops below the hagedorn temperature , the gravitons are produced not only by the thermal radiation studied above , but also due to the decay of the massive string excitations , i.e. due to the decay of large strings .",
    "on top of that , one should take into account the dilaton dynamics and the difference between the string frame and the einstein frame , which leads to many important consequences discussed in the previous section .",
    "these questions have not been analyzed in @xcite , and we wo nt pursue this issue here any further either .",
    "our investigation shows once again that it is very difficult to offer a non - inflationary solutions of the major cosmological problems .",
    "it remains quite instructive , however , to learn why is it so difficult to find an alternative to inflation . in this particular case ,",
    "the difficulties start from the very beginning , since even the existence of the basic cosmological solution is rather problematic , see section [ basic ] .",
    "nevertheless , one could still nurse a hope that this situation could somehow be improved in future development of the model , by adding new ingredients , finding a better effective action , etc .",
    "however , we do not think that this could help .",
    "our main concern stems from the fact that one of the ingredients of production of the cosmological perturbations in the scenario proposed in @xcite is purely kinematic : perturbations should freeze when they cross the horizon .",
    "this , of course , is the main idea of the inflationary mechanism of generation of perturbations of metric : during inflation the wavelength of the inflaton perturbations grow , and when the wavelength becomes greater than the size of the horizon , the perturbations freeze . the new idea of ref .",
    "@xcite is that in their model the wavelengths of the perturbations grow very slowly , but the quantity @xmath39 should rapidly shrink .",
    "then , they posit , perturbations freeze when @xmath39 becomes smaller than the wavelengths of the perturbations .",
    "however , this was just a conjecture , based on an analogy with the results obtained in inflationary cosmology .",
    "the easiest way to test this conjecture in the model proposed in @xcite is to study the evolution of the perturbations in the einstein frame . in this frame ,",
    "the perturbations shown in fig .",
    "1 from the very beginning have the wavelength much greater than @xmath55 , so the analogy with the inflationary mechanism breaks down .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the spectral index of the cosmological perturbations generated in this scenario is unacceptably large , @xmath0 .    of course",
    ", it might happen that eventually one will find a version of this model where the size of the horizon @xmath55 evolves extremely slowly , so that for a long time it remains nearly constant .",
    "then the cosmological evolution will cause the wavelengths of perturbations to cross the horizon , which , under certain conditions , may lead to their freezing .",
    "but the slow evolution of the hubble constant @xmath82 is a definitive feature of inflationary cosmology .",
    "thus , at the moment we do not see any reason to expect that this model or its possible generalizations can provide a viable alternative to inflation .",
    "* note added : * the main results of this paper were reported and debated with the authors of @xcite during the conference `` inflation+25 '' , paris , june 2006 .",
    "recently brandenberger , nayeri , patil and collaborators issued a paper @xcite where they confirmed our statement that the perturbations produced in the original scenario of @xcite have an unacceptably large spectral index @xmath0 .",
    "they argued that this scenario can be salvaged if the dilaton in the early universe were fixed by some unspecified strong coupling effects .",
    "we discuss this speculative possibility in sect .",
    "[ para ] , and conclude that it violates the null energy condition . even if such regime were possible , we show that the universe in this regime would accelerate both in the string frame and in the einstein frame .",
    "in other words , the universe in this speculative regime is inflationary , so it does not provide a true alternative to inflation .",
