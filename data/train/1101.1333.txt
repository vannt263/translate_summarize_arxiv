    "in the standard theory of structure formation in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe , larger structures such as dark halos corresponding to rich clusters of galaxies form through absorption of smaller dark halos and accretion of surrounding matter , which preferably occur along filaments associated with large scale structures in the universe .",
    "although baryonic components such as diffuse hot gas and galaxies are visible in x - ray and optical bands , dark matter , which is a dominant component in mass , can not be directly seen in any kind of radiation , and we recognized its presence only indirectly through dynamical properties of galaxies and hot gas .    in recent years , however , this situation has been changed by the development of gravitational lensing techniques , which enable us to reveal matter distribution in the universe directly .",
    "we do not require any assumptions of the dynamical status and mass - luminosity ratio of the system to get the mass distribution @xcite . whereas strong lensing technique is essentially model dependent",
    ", weak gravitational lensing enables us to obtain mass distribution in the plane of the sky without any geometrical assumptions and measures directly galaxy cluster mass distribution out to the virial radius @xcite .",
    "however , it is true that we can not get detailed properties of baryonic components associated with dark matter halos by gravitational lensing alone . therefore , joint studies of x - ray , optical and weak lensing datasets are very useful and provide us with important information of the interplay between baryonic and dark matter @xcite .    in the very near future ,",
    "large surveys in various wavebands ( e.g.  subaru / hyper - suprime - cam , erosita , spt , and act ) will provide us with huge datasets of galaxy clusters .",
    "in such future surveys , the weak gravitational lensing technique is one of the most powerful methods to find galaxy clusters , irrespective of the physical status of the baryonic components @xcite .",
    "its detection efficiency of clusters / groups is a function of masses as well as the geometry of the universe .",
    "a typical procedure is as follows ; the lensing convergence field is reconstructed from galaxy s ellipticities convolved with a suitable filter @xcite , and lensing signals above the noise of intrinsic ellipticities are identified as mass structures @xcite . however , there are still some uncertainties in this method such as contaminations of member galaxies in shear catalogs , spurious peaks induced by intrinsic ellipticities , and the projection effects due to superpositions of structures at different redshifts @xcite . owing to not only",
    "these uncertainties characteristic of the weak lensing surveys but also the systematic difference of detection efficiency among weak lensing , x - ray , and sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) surveys , it is still unclear whether halo candidates detected by weak lensing always contain hot baryons .",
    "thus , x - ray and/or sze follow - up observations of halo candidates discovered by weak lensing analysis are very important as a pilot study before forthcoming large surveys in order to understand systematic differences among different wavelength surveys and the correlations of physical properties between hot baryons and total mass .",
    "in particular , a study of the scaling relations between lensing mass and baryonic observables is of prime importance for the cluster cosmology as well as understanding cluster baryonic evolution , such as radiative cooling , energy feedback , and cluster mergers @xcite .",
    "we conducted suzaku x - ray follow - up observation of weak - lensing - detected halo candidates .",
    "x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) aboard suzaku satellite @xcite is suitable for observing low surface brightness diffuse sources thanks to its low and stable background @xcite .",
    "indeed , physical properties of the intracluster medium ( icm ) around the virial radius , where x - ray emission is too faint for chandra and xmm - newton to get meaningful results , have been investigated for several clusters @xcite .",
    "this feature is also very useful to investigate diffuse x - ray emission associated with mass structures , even less massive objects , found by weak lensing surveys .    as a pilot study for the above - mentioned purpose , we select a field around galaxy cluster zwcl0823.2 + 0425 .",
    "several dark halos are found around the cluster by weak lensing study @xcite as a collaboration of the local cluster substructure survey ( locuss ; pi : graham p. smith ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows optical image of the field overlaid with the mass contours derived from the weak lensing analysis of @xcite . besides the central halo corresponding to the zwcl0823.2 + 0425",
    ", four significant mass clumps are seen in the north , north - west , north - east , and south - east of it .",
    "we refer them as zwcl0823.2 + 0425 ( or c ) , n , nw , ne , and se hereafter . the mass peak corresponding to abell 664 is also found near the boundary .",
    "two major red - sequence galaxy populations are found in this field , whose spatial distributions of both optical luminosity and number density are pretty similar to that of mass @xcite .",
    "the galaxies in the red - sequence at the lower redshift are apparently associated with the c and nw halos . on the other hand ,",
    "those in the higher redshift red - sequence seem to be related with the n and ne halos .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic data are available for a few galaxies located in each halo center .",
    "we found that the mean redshift of galaxies associated with the c and nw halos is @xmath0 , and that of n and ne halos is @xmath1 .",
    "the se halo is likely to be associated with a bright galaxy at @xmath2 .",
    "however , a few galaxies in the background possibly contribute the lensing signal .",
    "this possible projection effect will be discussed in section [ s : d ] .",
    "although zwcl0823.2 + 0425 is recognized as an x - ray source with the flux of @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 in bright source catalog of rosat all sky survey @xcite , its detailed spectral properties are not known . moreover ,",
    "x - ray emission associated with the other halos are not clearly detected .",
    "therefore , deeper x - ray observation for this field is highly desirable to explore physical properties of the hot gas associated with the halos .    in this paper",
    ", we present suzaku x - ray follow - up observation of the field around zwcl0823.2 + 0425 to investigate the physical properties of the hot gas in the dark matter halos found via gravitational lensing analysis .",

    "the field of view ( fov ) of suzaku xis is shown in a subaru optical image overlaid with the mass contours derived from the weak lensing analysis @xcite in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the observation was performed at xis nominal pointing .",

    "events with a grade of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and status with 0:524287 were extracted .",
    "we excluded data obtained at the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , within 436s after the passage of saa , and at low elevation angles from an earth rim of @xmath11 and a sun - lit earth rim of @xmath12 . as a result ,",
    "effective exposure time was 41.3 ks .",
    "non x - ray background ( nxb ) spectra and images of xis were generated using the ftool `` xisnxbgen '' @xcite .",

    "for a spectral analysis of the xis data , redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) were generated using the ftool `` xisrmfgen '' .",
    "in addition , ancillary response files ( arfs ) , which describe the response of x - ray telescope aboard suzaku and the amount of the xis optical blocking filters contamination , were generated with the ftool `` xissimarfgen '' @xcite .",
    "xis spectra for each sensor ( xis0 , xis1 , xis3 ) were fitted simultaneously . for the spectral",

    "as shown in figure [ fig3 ] , we eliminated regions corresponding to each halo and the foreground bright star near the west edge of the xis fov , the rest of which was used for spectral fit to determine the background model . for the analysis of the background model , uniform emission over a circular region with 20 radius",
    "was used as an input image to generate an arf . the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , the galactic halo s hot gas ( gh ) , and the local hot bubble ( lhb )",

    "the radii of the regions are 2.5 , 2.0 , 1.8 , 1.8 , and 2.0 for c , n , ne , nw , and se , respectively .",
    "it is true that these radii should be as large as the expected virial radii of the corresponding halo .",
    "however , because each halo partially overlaps with one another and the spatial resolution of suzaku is moderate , the radii have to be small enough to reduce contamination from the others .",

    "nxb and cxb components were fluctuated at the 90 % confidence level of the systematic uncertainty mentioned above , which caused the changes of the best - fit parameters in the fits and gave us the systematic errors .",

    "the redshift of each halo was fixed to be a value obtained from the sdss data .",

    "again , the errors are at the one - sigma level .",
    "it should be noted that the mass used here is obtained from the weak - lensing data alone , which is perfectly independent of the x - ray results and free from the assumption about the dynamical status of the system .",
    "first , we fit the data into a power - law function setting both the index and normalization as a free parameter .",

    ", we do not take into account intrinsic scatter of the scaling relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result is consistent within large errors with what a self - similar model predicts , @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "next , we fit the data into a power - law function with the index fixed to that of the self - similar model .",
    "the resultant function is @xmath67 which is also plotted as dashed lines in figure [ fig13 ] .",
    "interestingly , the obtained normalization is consistent with that of the previous study ( @xmath68;@xcite ) for a sample of 12 clusters based on weak - lensing and x - ray datasets , which is plotted as dotted lines in figure [ fig13 ] , though they almost overlap with the dashed lines .",
    "although we assume the mass - concentration relation for three halos , note that the masses at the intermediate scale such as @xmath69 hardly depend on the assumed relation .",
    "as mentioned in section [ s : gas ] , the possible presence of cool cores and/or agns has very limited impacts on the temperature measurement . we would like to emphasize that this is the first confirmation of a self - similar scaling relation of mass and temperature for halos discovered by weak - lensing signals , whereas samples of x - ray selected clusters were used in previous studies of the mass scaling relation .",
    "the nw halo s mass expected from its temperature via equation ( [ eq : m500kt_fixed ] ) is twice as large as its actual upper limit , which might indicate that the nw halo is tidally truncated by the primary halo , zwcl0823.2 + 0425 .",
    "another possibility is the probable overestimation of the temperature because of the contamination as mentioned in section [ s : is ] .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig13.eps    halo detection criteria in weak lensing survey might be affected by the gaussian smoothing scale adopted in mass reconstruction .",
    "we therefore investigated dependence of significance level of peaks on smoothing scales . here , we do not make a selection of background galaxies , as a usual way .",
    "the significance levels changed by only @xmath70 as the smoothing scale changed by @xmath71 , and thus we conclude that this effect is negligible for halo detections .    in order to compared the significant level of peaks between the results with and without the color selection , we made the projected mass density map for the best - fit mass model with the same smoothing kernel as figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this is because the number density of the secure background galaxies is too small to reconstruct the mass map with the smoothing scale same as figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the peak @xmath72 for c and ne halos in the model map are higher than by @xmath73 and @xmath74 level of the reconstruction errors ( @xmath75 ) of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this implies that a contamination of the member galaxies in the shear catalog without color selection ( known as a dilution effect ) is significant for c and ne halos .",
    "the nw peak in the model map is about @xmath76 level lower , while se and n halo peaks are comparable between two maps . although we do not have a definite idea why the significance of nw halo decreases , it is possible that the background selection in the color - magnitude plane did not work well for some reasons . to make more secular selection of background galaxies , we need more detailed multi - band imaging data , as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "we also computed the contribution for the lensing signal from each halo to investigate the projection effect .",
    "the lensing effect from the other halos on c and n halo regions is only about @xmath77 .",
    "in contrast , the contribution from the others accounts for @xmath78 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 for se , ne and nw halo regions , respectively .",
    "as for the observed lensing signals of these three halo regions , therefore , the contribution from the others is not negligible . in particular , the projection effect and/or contribution from nearby halos are critical for halo detection with the weak - lensing technique , because they boost the peak strength in the mass map .",
    "for instance , the peak projected density of nw halo alone is only at @xmath80 level of the reconstruction error of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this indicates that we need further careful lensing studies for halo candidates discovered by lensing maps .",
    "otherwise , we can not rule out possibility that shear - selected catalog of clusters / groups is contaminated with some less massive objects . as for cluster surveys with weak lensing technique alone",
    ", this difficulty should be kept in mind to achieve a complete sample .",
    "we observed the field around the galaxy cluster zwcl0823.2 + 0425 , where several dark matter halos were found with the weak gravitational lensing technique .",
    "x - ray emission associated with most of these halos was clearly detected . from spectral analysis of the xis data , we determined temperature for the all halos detected in x - ray , and metal abundance for some of them , for the first time . with these results , we obtained the x - ray luminosity - temperature relation , which is consistent with the former typical results .",
    "the gravitational mass of each halo was obtained from the weak lensing data , which is absolutely independent from the x - ray data and free from the assumptions about the dynamical status of the systems . with the lensing and x - ray results , we investigated the mass - temperature relation for the halos , which is found to be consistent with the prediction of a simple self - similar model and previous studies .",
    "we first found the self - similar scaling relation of temperature and mass for halos detected by weak - lensing signals .",
    "therefore , our study demonstrates the importance of x - ray follow - up observations of shear - selected clusters , and shows that a joint x - ray and lensing analysis is crucial for clusters discovered by the forthcoming weak - lensing surveys , such as the one planned with subaru / hyper - suprime - cam .",
    "it is expected that the weak - lensing surveys will provide us with the uniform catalog of galaxy clusters irrespective of cluster dynamical states , though there are still some difficulties as discussed in section [ s : d ] .",
    "this is because the lensing technique depends on the cluster masses alone , which is free from the dynamical state .",
    "in contrast , x - ray and sze observables are obviously affected by cluster merger phenomena @xcite .",
    "a study of mass - scaling relations with statistically complete samples of galaxy clusters will enable us to understand cluster baryonic evolution , such as radiative cooling , pre - heating , and cluster mergers @xcite , and to make a robust mass - proxy based on principal component analysis @xcite .",
    "this will be an important step to constrain the equation of state for the dark energy through the cluster mass function .",
    "the future x - ray projects , such as _ astro - h _ and _ erosita _ , will be powerful in this regard .",

    "<S> we present the results of suzaku x - ray follow - up observation of weak - lensing - detected halos in the field around galaxy cluster zwcl0823.2 + 0425 . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly detected x - ray emission associated with most of these halos and determined their detailed physical parameters such as x - ray luminosity , temperature , and metal abundance , for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the x - ray luminosity - temperature relation for these halos agrees with former typical results . with mass determined from the weak gravitational lensing data , the mass - temperature relation for them </S>",
    "<S> is also investigated and found to be consistent with the prediction from a simple self - similar model and results of the previous studies with both lensing and x - ray data . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to emphasize that the self - similar scaling relation of mass and temperature is shown here for the first time using a weak - lensing selected sample , whereas previous studies of the mass scaling relation used x - ray - selected samples of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our study demonstrates importance of x - ray follow - up observations of shear - selected clusters , and shows that a joint x - ray and lensing analysis will be crucial for clusters discovered by the forthcoming weak - lensing surveys , such as the one planned with subaru / hyper - suprime - cam . </S>"
