    "a bar - joint framework in @xmath0 is a pair @xmath4 consisting of a simple undirected graph @xmath5 ( i.e. no loops or multiple edges ) and a placement @xmath6 of the vertices such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are distinct whenever @xmath9 is an edge of @xmath10 . given a norm on @xmath0 we are interested in determining when a given framework can be continuously and nontrivially deformed without altering the lengths of the bars .",
    "a well - developed rigidity theory exists in the euclidean setting for finite bar - joint frameworks ( and their variants ) which stems from classical results of a. cauchy @xcite , j. c. maxwell @xcite , a. d. alexandrov @xcite and g. laman @xcite .",

    "a modern treatment can be found in works of graver , servatius and servatius @xcite and whiteley @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more recently , significant progress has been made in topics such as global rigidity ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the rigidity of periodic frameworks ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) in addition to newly emerging themes such as symmetric frameworks @xcite and frameworks supported on surfaces @xcite . in this article",
    "we consider rigidity properties of both finite and infinite bar - joint frameworks @xmath4 in @xmath11 with respect to polyhedral norms .",

    "such norms are important from a number of perspectives .",
    "firstly , every norm on @xmath0 may be approximated by a polyhedral norm .",
    "secondly , polyhedral norms are used in diverse areas of mathematical modelling .",
    "thirdly , the rigidity theory obtained with polyhedral norms is distinctly different to the euclidean setting in admitting edge - labelling and spanning tree methods .",
    "a study of rigidity with respect to the classical non - euclidean @xmath13 norms was initiated in @xcite for finite bar - joint frameworks and further developed for infinite bar - joint frameworks in @xcite . among these norms",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath15 norms are simple examples of polyhedral norms and so the results obtained here extend some of the results of @xcite .    in section [ preliminaries ] we provide the relevant background material on polyhedral norms and finite and infinitesimal rigidity . in section [ infflexes ]",
    "we establish the role of support functionals in determining the space of infinitesimal flexes of a bar - joint framework ( theorem [ flex1 ] ) .",
    "we then distinguish between general bar - joint frameworks and those which are well - positioned with respect to the unit ball .",
    "the well - positioned placements of a finite graph are open and dense in the set of all placements and we show that finite and infinitesimal rigidity are equivalent for these bar - joint frameworks ( theorem [ t : rigiditythm2 ] ) .",
    "we then introduce the rigidity matrix for a general finite bar - joint framework , the non - zero entries of which are derived from extreme points of the polar set of the unit ball . in section [ edge ] we apply an edge - labelling to @xmath10 which is induced by the placement of each bar in @xmath0 relative to the facets of the unit ball . with this",
    "edge - labelling we identify necessary conditions for infinitesimal rigidity and obtain a sufficient condition for a subframework to be relatively infinitesimally rigid ( proposition [ relrigid ] ) .",
    "we then characterise the infinitesimally rigid bar - joint frameworks with @xmath2 induced framework colours as those which contain monochrome spanning trees of each framework colour ( theorem [ rigthm ] ) .",
    "this result holds for both finite and infinite bar - joint frameworks and does not require the framework to be well - positioned . for minimal infinitesimal rigidity",
    "we must assume that the bar - joint framework is well - positioned and an example is provided to demonstrate this . in section [ sparsity ]",
    "we apply the spanning tree characterisation to show that certain graph moves preserve minimal infinitesimal rigidity for any polyhedral norm on @xmath3 .",
    "we then show that in two dimensions a finite graph has a well - positioned minimally infinitesimally rigid placement if and only if it satisfies the counting conditions @xmath16 and @xmath17 for all subgraphs @xmath18 ( theorem [ laman ] ) .",
    "this is an analogue of laman s theorem @xcite which characterises the finite graphs with minimally infinitesimally rigid generic placements in the euclidean plane as those which satisfy the counting conditions @xmath19 and @xmath20 for subgraphs @xmath18 with at least two vertices .",
    "many of the results obtained hold equally well for both finite and infinite bar - joint frameworks .",
