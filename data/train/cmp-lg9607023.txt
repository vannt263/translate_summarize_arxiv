    "the most widely used language models in speech recognition are word - level models , such as word - pairs and word - bigrams @xcite@xcite@xcite . however , these models take too much space and need large corpus to be correctly trained . also they are domain dependent , so it is hard to add new vocabularies . to cope with these problems , several category - level language models",
    "are suggested @xcite@xcite .",
    "these models include word - category models based on the fisrt and last syllables of the words , and models using an automatic categorization technique to reduce the perplexity .",
    "the category - level language models showed a reduction in space requirements and better domain independance .",
    "for the agglunative languages , several morpheme category / tag - level models are also suggested @xcite@xcite .",
    "these models are basically the same as the ones used in text tagging systems , and use bigram / trigram statistics between tags .",
    "however , korean has many phonological changes which happen in a morpheme and between morphemes , and those changes result in the disparity between phonetic and orthographic descriptions of the morphemes . to cope with the phonological changes during korean speech recognition , we suggest a representation scheme for the phonological changes , and a morphological and phonological tag pair language model ( we call it pairwise language model ) .",
    "a hierarchical morphological tag set derived from the one used in written text analysis @xcite is used and a phonological tag set is constructed from the korean standard pronounciation rules @xcite .",
    "performance of the model is tested through an experimental tdnn(time - delayed neural network ) speech recognition system .",
    "the proposed model is quite extensible to new vocabularies and new domains by adding new dictionary entries for the necessary morphemes , and can be refined to bigram or trigram probabilistic models to give better recognition results .",
    "phonological changes during speech recognition in korean are modeled with phoneme - sequence - to - morpheme dictionary entries and a binary connectivity matrix .",
    "phoneme - sequence - to - morpheme dictionary : :    figure [ dict0 ] shows a sample entry of the    phoneme - sequence - to - morpheme dictionary . for a phoneme sequence [ n",
    "u    n ] , two morphemes are in the dictionary : one is an adnominal    verb - ending and the other is a noun - ending .",
    "the figure shows a left    and right morphological tag , and a left and right phonological tag for    the adnominal verb - ending case .",
    "+    the morphological tag `` ecnmg '' says that the morpheme is a    verb - ending(e ) , makes a complex sentence(c ) , especially a inner    sentence(n ) , through a noun phrase construction(m ) and it is an    adnominal verb - ending(g ) . the phonological tag",
    "`` p - n '' says that the    morpheme is not changed at all(- ) and the first(and the last for the    right phonological tag ) phoneme is [ n ] .",
    "`` p '' in ``",
    "p - n '' says that it    is a phonological tag .",
    "a phonological tag of the form `` pa = b''(see    figure 2 and 4 ) means that a is pronounced as [ b ] and `` pa2b''(see    figure 3 and 4 ) means a is pronounced as [ b ] by the neutralization    phenomenon .    + binary connectivity matrix : :    while the dictionary keeps the information about how a single morpheme    is changed phonologically , the phonological binary connectivity matrix    keeps the collocational information of two morphemes pronounciations .",
    "+    figure  [ matrix ] shows the connectivity matrix entries for consonant    assimilation phenomenon in korean .",
    "these entries say that a morpheme    whose last consonant t s ss are changed into    [ n ] , can be followed by a morpheme whose first phoneme is [ n ] or [ m ]",
    ".    wild characters ( * , ? ) can be used to reduce the number of entries in    the matrix .    +    generally , we apply the following two guidelines for the phonological rule modeling .    *",
    "make a new dictionary entry for each morphologically conditioned phonological changes : some phonological changes , such as vowel contraction and neutralization , happen only in the specific morphemes in a specific collocational relation . in these cases , registering all the phonologically changed morphemes or morpheme - sequences is prefered .",
    "* represent the final changes when more than one changes occur : when more than one phonological changes occur for a morpheme or between morphemes , register only the final form of each morpheme rather than all the intermediate forms .",
    "this strategy increases the number of dictionary entries but eliminates the successive rule application .",
    "in this section , major korean pronounciation rules ( text - to - speech rules ) @xcite are explained and their modeling ( for speech - to - text conversion ) using the dictionary and the connectivity matrix is described .",
    "yale romanization is adoted to represent the korean phonemes .",
