    "let @xmath0 be the _ chromatic polynomial _ of a simple graph @xmath1 that is @xmath0 is the number of proper @xmath2-colorings of @xmath3 in 1980 akiyama and harary @xcite raised the following question ` is there a graph @xmath1 that is not self - complementary and has a chromatic polynomial that equals to the chromatic polynomial of @xmath4 ? ' observe that since @xmath0 encodes the number of edges of @xmath1 a necessary conidition for a graph to have the posed property is that it has precisely @xmath5 edges .",
    "the question recived little attention until 1995 when j. xu and z. liu @xcite showed that such a graph indeed exists .",
    "they have shown that for any @xmath6 congurent to @xmath7 or @xmath8 modulo @xmath9 there exists a graph @xmath1 of order @xmath10 such that @xmath1 is not self - complementary and @xmath11 in their paper they constructed graphs with a specific degree sequence and then used the degree sequence to compute the chromatic polynomial of the coresponding graph .",
    "given the nature of their construction they posed    if a graph @xmath1 has the property that @xmath12 then @xmath1 has the same degree sequence as @xmath13    as it turns out , their conjecture is false . in this paper",
    "we present an infinite family of graphs not adhering to this condition .",
    "finally we turn our attention to a more general variant of the problem introduced by akiyama and harary . for a subset @xmath14",
    "we denote by @xmath15 the number of connected components of the graph with edge set @xmath16 and vertex set @xmath17 with this in mind the _ tutte polynomial _ of a graph @xmath1 is defined as @xmath18    the tutte polynomial @xmath19 contains much more information about the structure of @xmath1 than @xmath20 does .",
    "indeed , it is well known that @xmath21 among the many other interesting evaluations of the tutte polynomial are @xmath22 - the number of spanning trees of @xmath1 and @xmath23 the number of cyclic and acycic orientations of @xmath1 respectively . for",
    "a survey of known results about the tutte polynomial see @xcite .",
    "a natural generalization of the harary - akiyama question following from these properties of the tutte polynomial is , wheter there exists non self - complementary graphs having the same tutte polynomial as their complement . in this paper",
    "we shall prove    there exists infinitely many graphs that are not self - complementary and have the same tutte polynomial as their complement .",
    "in this section we present a family of graphs having equal chromatic polynomials as their complements but different degree sequence .",
    "we start with the graph depicted on figure [ g1 ] together with its complement .",
    "its _ graph6 _",
    "string @xcite is ` hcpvdzy ` .",
    "first , we establish that @xmath1 has the desired properties .",
    "[ l0 ] there exists a graph @xmath1 of order 9 such that @xmath1 and @xmath4 have different degree sequences but @xmath24    we observe that the graph @xmath1 from figure [ g1 ] has degree sequence @xmath25 while its complement has degree sequence @xmath26 using the well known _",
    "deletion - contraction _",
    "recurrence for computing the chromatic polynomial of a graph we can verify that @xmath27 alternatively we can verify the stated claim using the sage program presented in the appendix .        before showing the main claim of this section , we introduce a useful construction .",
    "given a graph @xmath1 we form the graph @xmath28 by taking a vertex disjoint @xmath9-path @xmath29 and joining every vertex of @xmath1 to both endpoints of @xmath30 conveniently , we have @xmath31 using this property it is not difficult to establish the following claim .    [ t1 ]",
    "there exists infinitely many graphs @xmath1 not having the same degree sequence as @xmath4 but having the same chromatic polynomial as their complements .",
    "we compute the chromatic polynomial of @xmath32 suppose we wish to properly color @xmath28 with @xmath2 colors .",
    "let @xmath33 be the endpoints of the @xmath9-path @xmath29 introduced in @xmath28 and let @xmath34 be the respective neighbors of @xmath35 and @xmath36 in @xmath30 there are essentialy two different ways to color @xmath32 if we color @xmath33 with equal colors then there are @xmath37 choices to color @xmath38 and @xmath39 colors to color @xmath40 and hence @xmath41 ways to properly @xmath2-color @xmath32 if @xmath33 are colored with different colors then we again have two cases .",
    "if @xmath40 is colored with the same color as @xmath35 then we have @xmath42 total ways to color @xmath32 if however @xmath40 is not colored with the same color as @xmath35 we end up having @xmath43 ways to propery color our graph using @xmath2 colors . summing up the obtained quantities we infer @xmath44 in particular we see from the above expression that @xmath28 is in fact a function of @xmath45 the main claim now follows quickly with an inductive argument . by lemma 2",
    "we have a graph @xmath1 of order 9 having a different degree sequence than @xmath4 but the same chromatic polynomial .",
    "but then the degree sequences of @xmath28 and @xmath46 differ while for their chromatic polynomials the above identity implies @xmath47 hence by using this construction iteratively we obtain an infinite family of graphs with the stated property .    making a computer search",
    "it can be seen that there are graphs on 12 vertices that have the property stated in theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "hence it is easy to extend the proof of theorem [ t1 ] to show that for any @xmath48 congurent to @xmath7 or @xmath8 @xmath49 there exist a graph @xmath1 not having the same degree sequence as @xmath4 but sharing the same chromatic polynomial .",
    "a very useful property of the chromatic polynomial that we exploited in the proof of theorem [ t1 ] is the fact that the chromatic polynomial of a graph operation is often a function of the chromatic polynomials of its operands .",
    "unfortunately the same is not generally true for the tutte polynomial .",
    "indeed , consider two trees of order @xmath9 , the star graph @xmath50 and the path graph @xmath51 both have the same tutte polynomial namely @xmath52 consider now their _ cone graph _",
    ", that is the graph obtained by adding a new vertex and joining it to all other vertices .",
    "the cone of @xmath50 has @xmath53 spanning trees while while the cone of @xmath54 has @xmath55 spanning trees .",
    "hence the tutte polynomials of the cones of @xmath50 and @xmath54 are different .    in order to apply the construction introduced in the previous section , we need an additional structure of our graphs that will assure that if two graphs @xmath1 and @xmath56 have equal tutte polynomials then so do @xmath28 and @xmath57    as it turns out , the following concept is quite useful for this purpose .",
    "let @xmath56 be a spanning subgraph of @xmath1 having connected components of order @xmath58 we say that @xmath59 is a _ subgraph description _ of @xmath60 let now @xmath61 be the lexicographically sorted tuple of subgraph descriptions for every subgraph of @xmath3 we call @xmath61 the _ subgraph sequence _ of @xmath3 observe that equation [ tutteeq ] implies that if two graphs have the same subgraph sequence then they also have the same tutte polynomial .",
    "the converse is of course not true as witnessed by the above example with @xmath54 and @xmath62 our next lemma asserts that the property of having the same subgraph sequence is preserved by the construction introduced in the previous section .",
    "[ l1 ] if @xmath1 and @xmath56 are graphs such that @xmath63 then @xmath64    let @xmath65 be a spanning subgraph of @xmath32 observe that @xmath65 is obtained by taking a spanning subgraph of @xmath1 with subgraph description @xmath66 adding the remaining four vertices of @xmath28 comming from the introduced @xmath9-path @xmath29 and finally adding some of the edges with at least one endpoint in @xmath30 that is we add some of the edges of @xmath29 and then some of the edges from the endpoints of @xmath29 to some vertices of the connected components of @xmath3    by assumption @xmath1 has the same subgraph sequence as @xmath56 hence there is a bijective mapping between their subgraph sequences .",
    "let @xmath67 be the subgraph of @xmath56 with subgraph sequence @xmath68 that is prescribed by such bijection .",
    "since @xmath67 and @xmath65 have the same subgraph description there is bijective way to map every extension of @xmath65 to a subgraph of @xmath28 to an extension of @xmath67 to a subgraph of @xmath57 indeed , we may assume the vertices of @xmath1 and @xmath56 to be ordered and then for every edge that is added from one of the endpoints @xmath35 of @xmath29 to the the @xmath69th vertex of the @xmath70th component of @xmath1 we add the edge between @xmath35 and the @xmath69th vertex of the @xmath70th component of @xmath60 this is always well defined since @xmath56 and @xmath1 have the same subgraph description .    in order to apply lemma [ l1 ]",
    "we need to find a non self - complementary graph @xmath1 such that @xmath71 as already noted this immediately implies @xmath72 one of the smallest graphs with such property has order @xmath73 and is presented on figure [ g2 ] .",
    "its graph6 string is ` gcrdvk ` .",
    "[ l2 ] there exist a non self - complementary graph of order @xmath73 such that @xmath71    consider the graph @xmath1 from figure [ g2 ] .",
    "observe that @xmath1 and @xmath4 both have two vertices of degree @xmath74 in @xmath1 these two vertices share a common neighbor while the vertices of degree @xmath75 in @xmath4 have no common neighbors .",
    "hence @xmath1 and @xmath4 are not isomorphic . to verify the second part of the claim , that is @xmath76 is a tedious process",
    "hence we invite the reader to inspect appendix [ appa ] presenting a sage program verifying the claim .",
    "we are now ready to prove the main claim of this section .",
    "[ tt ] there exist infinitely many graphs @xmath1 such that @xmath77 but @xmath72    by lemma [ l2 ] there is a non self - complementary graph on @xmath78 vertices such that @xmath79 which implies @xmath80 but then , by lemma [ l1 ] the graph @xmath28 again has the same subgraph description as its complement and is not self - complementary . hence applying this operation iteratively on @xmath1 we end up with an infinite family of graphs possesing the stated property .",
    "again as with the chromatic polynomial we can find a graph of order @xmath78 having the properties of lemma [ l2 ] . hence it is possible to show in the same way as we did in the proof of theorem [ tt ] that for any @xmath6 congurent to @xmath81 modulo @xmath9 there exist a non self - complementary graph of order @xmath10 having the same tutte polynomial as its complement .",
    "we were not able to find an example of a graph @xmath1 with different degree sequence from @xmath4 but same tutte polynomial .",
    "a computer search indicates that such a graph would have to have at least @xmath82 vertices .",
    "hence we leave the following problem .",
    "find a graph @xmath1 with different degree sequence than @xmath4 but same tutte polynomial or show that such a graph does not exists .",
    "interestingly the equivalent problem for chromatic polynomials motivated this paper .",
    "we are thankful to thank sandi klavar for constructive remarks to gordon royle and georgi guninski for help with some computational aspects of the problem and to nejc trdin for kindly sharing his computational resources .",
    "in this appendix we show how to prove the claims of lemmas [ l1 ] , [ l2 ] using the open source mathematical software sage @xcite .",
    "all examples can be directly copy - pasted into sage s shell ."
