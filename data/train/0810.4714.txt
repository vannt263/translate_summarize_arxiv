    "through the combination of radio telescopes spread world wide , very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) yields the highest resolutions and the most accurate positions in astronomy . at a wavelength of 2 cm ,",
    "i.e. , the very long baseline array ( vlba ) provides resolutions of the order of 1  milliarcsecond ( mas ) ( that is , of parsec scales for quasars and bllac objects at moderate redshifts , and far below this for the closer radio galaxies ) .",
    "vlbi has a large sensitivity when using large telescopes , but is in general limited to high brightness temperature sources ( above @xmath0k ) and to narrow fields ( not larger than the arc second , generally limited by the correlator parameters rather than by the beam size of the single telescopes involved in the observations ) , making the source structure to be easily resolved out .",
    "it is , thus , an invaluable technique to study the highly relativistic jets agn .    due to relativistic effects",
    ", the intrinsic quantities in the agn have to be deduced from the observed ones , which are affected by doppler boosting and light travel time effects .",
    "table [ table : jetphys ] provides the basic relationships between the measured and the observed quantities . as a result of doppler boosting ,",
    "most of the agn jets appear one - sided .",
    "some close galaxies with small doppler factors show jet and counter - jet with more symmetric features .",
    "@xmath1    prior to the vlba construction in the early 1990s , monitoring programs of agn were difficult due to the sparse number of available antennas , the limited resources in terms of telescope time and recording media , and the difficulties to schedule repeated , homogeneous observations . in 1994",
    "we initiated a vlba programme at 15ghz : the 2 cm vlba survey ( see table [ table : surveys ] ) .",
    "the aim of the programme is to study the parsec - scale structure and kinematics of relativistic agn jets to understand the acceleration and collimation of relativistic jets .",
    "the program was continued as mojave since 2003 .",
    "this effort , limited to declinations over @xmath2 , is complemented since 2007 by the tanami program for the southern skies ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the nominal resolutions of the images are slightly below 1mas , and with typical overall on - source observing times of 1hr , dynamic ranges up to 1000:1 are achieved . to monitor the jets in the radio sources ,",
    "the feature positions and sizes of the radio images in the sky are measured directly , or alternatively , models are applied to the interferometric visibility data .",
    "after several observations , their time evolution is studied .",
    "our effort in this field is complementary with further kinematic surveys performed at longer wavelengths ( e.g. , at @xmath43.6 cm with a global array by piner _",
    "et al _ ( 2007 ) and at @xmath46 cm on the caltech - jodrell flat spectrum sample by and britzen _ et al _ 2008 and references therein ) and shorter ones ( @xmath47 mm monitoring on a smaller sample by jorstad _",
    "( 2001 ; 2005 ) ) .",
    "by collecting subsequent observations of the quasars , the changing positions of the jet features are measured , yielding apparent speed values far beyond 1015@xmath6 .",
    "the same measurements in radio galaxies and bllac objects show usually lower values .",
    "detailed results for all the sources in the surveys are presented in kellermann _",
