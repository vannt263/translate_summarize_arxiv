    "the atlas and cms experiments at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) have both reported a combined 5  @xmath10 discovery of higgs - like boson in the two channels of highest resolution , the di - photon ( @xmath11 ) and four - lepton ( @xmath12 ) with the data of integrated luminosity of 5  fb@xmath9 at 7 tev plus 5  fb@xmath9 at 8 tev running @xcite .",
    "both di - photon and four - lepton have shown hints of resonance with reconstructed invariant mass around @xmath13  gev .",
    "excess in the pure leptonic @xmath14 was also confirmed later in the consistent range of the four - lepton from @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "precision measurement of properties of such resonance will play important role to determine whether it is the standard model ( sm ) higgs .",
    "distinct signals of di - photon and four - lepton modes clearly show that there exists a spin zero or spin two resonance that couples to weak gauge bosons . at hadron colliders ,",
    "the @xmath16-channel resonance can be produced via light quark annihilation or gluon fusion . since the scalar couples to the left - handed and right - handed fermions ,",
    "a light quark mass is then proportional to the coupling between this scalar and light quark .",
    "if the resonance is a scalar , gluon fusion production becomes the only option .",
    "the gluon fusion ( @xmath17 ) production and the di - photon decay @xmath18 are both loop induced which are sensitive to physics involved in the loops .",
    "measurements of such channels provide ways to probe new physics of higher scale at the same time .",
    "latest datas from both atlas and cms have shown that the measured di - photon rate is significantly larger than the sm prediction while the four - lepton rate is about the same as the sm prediction at 125 gev .",
    "results from the cms collaboration are 1.560.43 where @xmath19 is the higgs - like resonance @xcite . in the four - lepton channel ,",
    "the expected sm significance of the sm higgs is 3.8  @xmath10 while the observed value is 3.2  @xmath10 .",
    "the atlas collaboration have reported 4.5  @xmath10 significance in di - photon while the sm higgs expectation is 2.4  @xmath10 and results in four - lepton channel showed an observed 3.4  @xmath10 significance versus a 2.6  @xmath10 expectation .",
    "the other channels with @xmath20 and @xmath21 are more challenging experimentally than the previous channels .",
    "the atlas collaboration sees no excess in the above channels while cms collaboration reported about @xmath22 in the channels . on the other hand , the cdf and @xmath23 collaborations at tevatron",
    "have both reported excess of @xmath24 in the light higgs mass range of 115 - 130  gev which is consistent with the lhc findings of 124 - 126  gev @xcite .",
    "the excess at tevatron is crucial to test various models .    for given scalar mass @xmath25 , the gluon fusion @xmath16-channel resonance @xmath19 production with decaying into diphoton",
    ", @xmath11 is approximately proportional to , thus there only exist three categories to enhance the di - photon : enhanced @xmath26 , enhanced @xmath18 or the reduced total width @xmath27 .",
    "one scenario is through increased @xmath28 with total width increasing at slower rate .",
    "the second scenario is through increased @xmath1 .",
    "and the third one is the reduced total width , for instance , the reduced @xmath29 through mixing .",
    "example of the first category is models with fourth generation fermions@xcite or enhanced yukawa models , like bosonic technicolor @xcite and type - i two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) , in which there exists a higgs - like doublet scalar but at the same time , there also exists fermiophobic sector that contribute to the @xmath30/@xmath31 mass . within sm ,",
    "@xmath18 decay involves two types of contribution of @xmath30 loop and top quark loop with opposite signs@xcite .",
    "the sm @xmath30-loop dominates @xmath18 partial width .",
    "the enhancement in @xmath26 inevitably enhances the cancellation in the @xmath18 .",
    "the enhanced yukawa model predicts reduced couplings with the weak gauge bosons @xmath30 and @xmath31 which leads to significant reduction in the associated production of higgs @xmath32 or @xmath33 with enlarged @xmath20 decay branching fraction which may fit the tevatron observations .",
    "however , for @xmath34gev , the fermionic decays @xmath20 , @xmath35 still dominate the higgs total width .",
    "enhancement due to top quark yukawa is then cancelled by the enhanced total width from fermionic decays .",
    "the diphoton partial width must increase in order to achieve the enhanced diphoton rate while this corresponds to an un - natural region that the @xmath30-mass @xmath36 mostly arises from the fermiophobic sector .",
    "the model with fourth generation fermions predicts similar rate of associated production @xmath32 as the sm higgs prediction .",
    "however , in order to explain the measurement of @xmath37 , it usually requires significant reduction of all known decay modes in both @xmath20 and @xmath38 by introducing new decay channel to fourth generation neutrinos @xmath39 . in the third category , models with reduced total width by reducing @xmath20 and @xmath40 through mixing also predicts suppressed @xmath41 at tevatron .",
    "therefore , the over 2  @xmath10 excess at tevatron of @xmath24 does not favor the first category or the third category of models .",
    "consequently , models with enhanced @xmath1 @xcite become the most favorable models for combined measurements at both lhc and tevatron .    in order to achieve the enhanced @xmath18 without effecting @xmath17 ,",
    "the model requires non - colored charged states that couple to the higgs boson . in the extension of sm",
    ", there are several candidates of this kind , for instance , @xmath42 , charged higgs , heavy leptons or leptonic partners in supersymmetric theory @xcite .",
    "we study the light stau in supersymmetric standard models to illustrate models with the enhanced @xmath18 .",
    "the scenario was first proposed by @xcite and further studied in @xcite . however , with only electroweak production , light stau is extremely challenging to search for at the lhc @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the the benchmark scenario in mssm with enhancement in stau production and at the same time with the prediction of 125  gev higgs that has enhanced @xmath43 rate and predictions consistent with other observations .",
    "in particular , we emphasize how the light stau production can be significantly enhanced from not - very - heavy @xmath44 and inclusive stau pairs from gaugino productions .",
    "before we conclude , we discuss the kinematic feature and searching potential at the lhc for such enhanced inclusive stau pair production .",
    "low energy supersymmetry has been the most elegant solution to the gauge hierarchy problem in the last three decades . in decoupling region of mssm , the lighter",
    "cp even neutral scalar @xmath19 behaves as a sm - like higgs boson and we assume the discovered resonance is the @xmath19 boson .",
    "the strongest motivation for supersymmetry is the cancellation of quadratic divergence , in particular , the top quark contribution due to large top yukawa . at the same time",
    ", the squarks also significantly modify the higgs production via gluon fusion and higgs decaying into di - photon @xcite .",
    "since the data set for the four - lepton final states are about the same as the sm higgs prediction , we argue the gluon fusion production should not be changed significantly by the effects due to squarks .",
    "the general sfermion mass matrix is @xmath45 where the off  diagonal entries are @xmath46 for top squark with @xmath47 the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two  higgs fields which break the electroweak symmetry , @xmath48 the trilinear squark coupling which breaks the @xmath49-symmetry , and @xmath50 higgsino mass parameter , respectively . @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the left and right  handed soft  susy breaking sfermion masses .",
    "the @xmath53 terms , in units of @xmath54 are given in terms of the weak isospin and electric charge of the squark by : @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
