    "as an archetype of open quantum systems popularized by leggett @xcite , the spin - boson model ( sbm ) finds applications in condensed matter physics and chemistry in a wide variety of areas ranging from processes of electron transfer @xcite to dynamics of qubit - bath entanglement@xcite .",
    "the sbm consists of a two - level system ( tls ) coupled linearly to a bath of harmonic oscillators which accounts for the influence of the environment .",
    "the coupling strength between them can be specified by a spectral function @xmath1 which is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "depending on the value of spectral exponent @xmath3 , there exist three distinct cases known as sub - ohmic ( @xmath4 ) , ohmic ( @xmath5 ) and super - ohmic ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "theoretical studies predominantly focus on the ground - state properties of the sbm among which the quantum phase transition draws significant attention .",
    "no phase transition occurs for the super - ohmic case , as the system is always in a delocalized ground state . for the ohmic case in which the sbm can be mapped onto the anisotropic kondo model by using bosonization techniques",
    ", it is well understood that there exists a kosterlitz - thouless - type phase transition@xcite . however , in the most challenging case of the sub - ohmic regime , a successful and comprehensive description of the sbm has proved elusive despite it being studied by several sophisticated numerical methods@xcite .    in the sub - ohmic regime , the slow decay of bath correlations , implying a longer - lasting bath memory effect , renders invalid the methods based on the born - markov approximation with even more deteriorating validity in a deeper sub - ohmic regime with @xmath7 . the localization - delocalization phase transition for the sub - ohmic regime has been studied by bulla _",
    "@xcite , wherein non - mean - field exponents for the continuous phase transition in deep sub - ohmic regime @xmath7 were obtained .",
    "however , recent numerical studies have found mean - field exponents in the deep sub - ohmic regime as well @xcite . by using an extension of the silbey - harris variational wave function",
    "@xcite which is the two - site version of the davydov @xmath0 ansatz from the theory of `` davydov soliton '' , to study the ground state properties of the sub - ohmic sbm with @xmath8 , chin _",
    "et al_.  @xcite claimed that such a trial wave function generates correct mean - field exponents for the continuous localization - delocalization transition .",
    "it is commonly accepted that there is a second - order phase transition separating a non - degenerate delocalized phase from a doubly degenerate localized phase thanks to a likely bath - induced spontaneous magnetization on the spin @xcite .",
    "the sub - ohmic case also shows some special dynamical properties . with an increase in the spin - bath coupling strength , coherent oscillations in the sbm",
    "will eventually morph into classical - like damping which is accompanied by the transition from a delocalized state to a localized one @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies show that the nonequilibrium coherent dynamics can persist for ultrastrong coupling to a sub - ohmic bath with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the sbm @xcite is similar to a one - exciton , two - site version of the holstein molecular crystal model @xcite , which is among the most popular hamiltonians for studying optical and transport properties of molecular and biological systems . in the holstein hamiltonian",
    ", diagonal coupling is defined as a nontrivial dependence of the exciton site energies on the lattice coordinates , and off - diagonal coupling , as a nontrivial dependence of the exciton transfer integral on the lattice coordinates @xcite .",
    "off - diagonal interactions between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom have been emphasized by mahan as modulations of electron - electron interactions by ion vibrations @xcite .",
    "similarly , the off - diagonal coupling in the sbm represents bath - induced modulation of the spin tunneling .",
    "accounting for both the diagonal and off - diagonal coupling is important , e.g. , in characterizing solid - state excimers , where a variety of experimental and theoretical considerations point to a strong dependence of electronic tunneling upon certain coordinated distortions of neighboring molecules on the formation of bound excited states @xcite .",
    "mishchenko and nagaosa have shown that the off - diagonal coupling allows coexistence of free and self - trapped states even in quasi - one - dimensional compound a - pmda consisting of alternating donor and acceptor molecules @xcite .",
    "it is well known that there exists no phase transition for the holstein model if one considers only the diagonal coupling  @xcite .",
    "however , novel discontinuities have been found in the simultaneous presence of the diagonal and the off - diagonal coupling @xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed @xcite that the off - diagonal coupling modulates the hopping integral of the zhang - rice singlet and the superexchange interaction in the low - doping regime of high - temperature superconductivity . due to challenges in obtaining reliable solutions @xcite ,",
    "hamiltonians containing off - diagonal coupling appear rarely in the polaron literature , and exciton - phonon interactions in the holstein model , or the coupling between the system and the bath in the sbm , are usually considered to be of diagonal form . in this work , by employing the davydov @xmath0 ansatz , we seek to help fill the void in the theoretical study of sbm phase transitions in the deep sub - ohmic regime @xmath7 in the simultaneous presence of diagonal and off - diagonal coupling .",
    "the davydov ansatz and its variants @xcite have been successfully employed as trial wave functions for the one - dimensional holstein system @xcite and the rabi model @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of a holstein polaron can be obtained by solving the equations of motion obtained from the dirac - frenkel time - dependent variation technique @xcite for the variational parameters of the davydov ansatz .",
    "the davydov @xmath0 ansatz has in particular been used as a simple and reliable method to study both the dynamic and static properties of the sbm in deep sub - ohmic regime @xmath7 with only diagonal coupling@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the finding that the davydov @xmath0 ansatz is especially accurate in the strong exciton - phonon coupling regime @xcite from our earlier study , provides support to our contention that the same ansatz may also be reliably employed for sbm in deep sub - ohmic regime @xcite .",

    "ii , the sbm with simultaneous diagonal and off - diagonal coupling is presented .",

    "the type of interaction between the tls and the boson bath is characterized by the spectral exponents @xmath3 and @xmath28 for diagonal and off - diagonal coupling , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that we use a common boson bath for both diagonal and off - diagonal coupling , but with different spectral densities . in the absence of off - diagonal coupling ,",
    "the term @xmath29 in sbm describing the bias between the states @xmath30 and @xmath31 forbids the continuous quantum phase transition .",
    "introduction of the bias leads to the disruption of the symmetry of the sbm and accordingly , the ground state would tend to be spin - up or spin - down state .",
    "this implies the absence of a delocalized state , and that there may exist only a localized state which corresponds to nonzero magnetization .",
    "the off - diagonal coupling denotes the influence of the boson bath on the spin tunneling , and its introduction is believed to compete with the bias .",
    "therefore , it is anticipated that novel features may emerge in the ground state properties .",
    "the davydov @xmath0 ansatz is often employed to describe the motion of an exciton accompanied by a phonon cloud on a finite one - dimensional lattice .",
    "known to be numerically efficient , the hierarchy of davydov wave functions including the davydov @xmath0 trial state has been widely used to study exciton - phonon dynamics in molecular and biological systems @xcite .",

    "it is easy to check that @xmath140 yields the correct values of the ground state energy in these two limits .",
    "versus @xmath54 for @xmath159 ( solid , black ) , @xmath160 ( dashed , red ) , and @xmath90 ( dash - dotted , blue ) for @xmath161 , @xmath64 and @xmath162 . ]    it is well known that there occurs a continuous phase transition for the unbiased sbm with only the diagonal coupling . with the introduction of a finite bias ( @xmath163 ) , and simultaneous diagonal and off - diagonal couplings",
    ", the hamiltonian ( 1 ) has no @xmath164 symmetry @xcite , and thus @xmath165 is generally nonzero .",
    "however there still exists an instability in the ground state if the modified bias @xmath166 is zero . the calculated energy difference @xmath167 $ ] as a function of @xmath54(@xmath168 corresponds to energy extremum )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ egm03d01bs001 ] for three values of @xmath24 when @xmath161 and @xmath169 . at @xmath170 ,",
    "the system energy exhibits only a single minimum at @xmath171 , and the system is in a localized state . for @xmath172 , and @xmath90 ,",
    "it is obvious to see that the system energy exhibits double minima , indicating the instability of the ground state .",
    "furthermore , with an increase in the diagonal coupling strength that is accompanied by a decrease in off - diagonal coupling , there appears a continuous crossover of the sbm from a non - degenerate localized phase to double degenerate localized phase .",
    "we note that the necessary condition of the continuous crossover of the ground state is @xmath173 .    in the framework of the transformed sbm with only diagonal coupling , combined coupling @xmath174 and the modified bias @xmath175 and tunneling amplitude @xmath176",
    "all depend on the diagonal and off - diagonal coupling strengths of hamiltonian ( 1 ) . as the coupling strengths @xmath24 and @xmath25 change , @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath174 adopt new values . in the parameter space satisfying the condition @xmath177 ,",
    "the modified bias @xmath175 is always nonzero , while it is known that only for the requirement @xmath178 , there emerges a continuous crossover of the ground state from single localized phase to a doubly degenerate localized phase .",
    "it follows that the aforementioned continuous crossover does not contradict the discontinuous behavior revealed in the previous subsection using the davydov @xmath0 ansatz , because the condition of @xmath179 employed here is inherently different from the requirement of @xmath61 ( in the expansion for @xmath56 around @xmath57 ) in the latter case . from a physical perspective , as the effect of the off - diagonal coupling may run counter to that of the bias , it is possible for the system to stay in a delocalized phase with @xmath57 for a certain off - diagonal coupling strength under a finite bias .",
    "as the condition of @xmath61 implies that there exists a finite @xmath175 , i.e. , @xmath180 , the energy surface @xmath56 is asymmetric about @xmath57 as shown in fig .  5 .",
    "for weak off - diagonal coupling , there is only one minimum at @xmath181 on the energy surface , and the system is in a delocalized phase . on the other hand , with @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "inter - related as shown in fig .",
    "[ a - b ] , for a certain special parameter regime , the energy surface exhibits two asymmetrical localized minima because @xmath180 , with either a finite @xmath54 or zero @xmath54 ( cf .",
    "fig .  5 ) .",
    "the minimum with a lower energy corresponds to the stable ground state . at the same time",
    ", the maximum occurs at nonzero @xmath54 .",
    "this implied the possibility of a phase transition showing an abrupt crossover from a delocalized state with @xmath57 to a localized state with @xmath182 provided that the diagonal and off - diagonal coupling strengths satisfy the condition @xmath61 .",
    "it is thus likely that a discontinuous phase transition occurs as a result of the combined effect of the bias and the two competing forms of the spin - boson coupling , marking a behavior that is entirely different from the continuous phase transition in the unbiased sbm devoid of the off - diagonal coupling .",
    "our work thus reveals the rich energy landscapes and transition properties emerging from the competition between the diagonal and the off - diagonal coupling in the extended sub - ohmic sbm .",
    "off - diagonal exciton - phonon coupling is an important issue often neglected by the polaron community .",
    "early treatments of the off - diagonal coupling in the holstein hamiltonian include the munn - silbey theory @xcite , the toyozawa ansatz @xcite , and sumi s theory employing the dynamic coherent potential approximation ( dcpa ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dcpa based theory was generalized by kato _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite while an explicit expression was subsequently derived by hannewald _",
    "et al . _  for the temperature dependence of the polaron bandwidths by treating diagonal and off - diagonal coupling on an equal footing",
    "more recently , the global - local ansatz @xcite , formulated by zhao _",
    "et al . _  in the early 90s , has been compared with dcpa with the hartree approximation @xcite , and the delocalized form of the davydov @xmath0 ansatz has been used to study the ground - state properties of the holstein hamiltonian with off - diagonal coupling @xcite .",
    "the absence of phase transitions in the holstein model when one considers only the diagonal coupling is well known  @xcite .",
    "recent studies however indicate that novel nonanalyticities may emerge in the simultaneous presence of the diagonal and the off - diagonal coupling .",
    "for example , a sharp transition at the critical electron - phonon coupling strength of the su - schrieffer - heeger model was revealed by marchand _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . by employing linearized von neumann entropy to quantify exciton - phonon correlations in the ground state , zhang _",
    "et al . _",
    "uncovered the discontinuities in the presence of off - diagonal coupling of the antisymmetric form as opposed to the smooth crossover resulting from the symmetric off - diagonal coupling @xcite .",
    "owing to the similarity between the sbm and the holstein model , trial states from the hierarchy of davydov anstze may yield reliable results on the ground state properties upon inclusion of the off - diagonal coupling .    in this work",
    "we have systematically explored the possibility of a phase transition in the sbm in the simultaneous presence of the diagonal and off - diagonal spin - boson coupling . as the davydov @xmath0 ansatz",
    "was employed successfully in studying the holstein polaron , an analogous approach was taken in this work to investigate the sbm by drawing parallels to its relevance to the sbm .",
    "it is demonstrated that a taylor series expansion of the system energy reveals the possible occurrence of the phase transition as well as its nature , if it does occur .",
    "the existence of a continuous phase transition in the sbm with purely diagonal coupling has been shown earlier  @xcite , however it is known to vanish in the presence of a bias .",
    "primarily focussing on the influence of the off - diagonal coupling , the current work reveals the presence of a discontinuous transition between the states characterized by zero and finite magnetization for the sub - ohmic sbm .",
    "it is to be noted , however , that the control parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath17 and @xmath16 , must satisfy a certain interrelation to guarantee that that the first order derivative of the system energy with respect to the magnetization @xmath54 is always zero .",
    "this criterion leads to an increase in the required off - diagonal coupling strength with an increase in the bias .",
    "this imposition of restraints on the involved model parameters lends specificity to the resulting trajectory in the parameter space exhibiting discontinuous behavior .",
    "accordingly , the possibility of observing such abrupt transitions in a ` realistic ' system is rather remote , yet our results bear a significance in yielding valuable theoretical insights on the emergence of novel features in the ground state of the sub - ohmic sbm .",
    "the magnetization corresponding to the extreme values of the system energy is found to be asymmetrical about zero magnetization . at the critical coupling strength",
    ", there exists a discontinuous change from a non - degenerate delocalized state ( @xmath57 ) to another non - degenerate localized state ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "the corresponding critical coupling strength decreases with an increase of @xmath28 if all other control parameters are fixed .",
    "we have also probed the entanglement entropy near the phase transition , revealing a discontinuity in it at the transition point . for @xmath111 ,",
    "a unitary transformation has been borrowed to map hamiltonian ( 1 ) to a sbm model with modified bias and tunneling amplitude . in the framework of the unitary transformation approach @xcite",
    ", we have obtained the ground state energy of hamiltonian ( 1 ) and discuss its instabilities .",
    "two types of crossover in the ground state have been uncovered .",
    "in addition to the discontinuous crossover from zero magnetization to a finite one , a continuous phase transition also exists in some parameter regime which satisfies zero modified bias ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "with simultaneously considered diagonal and off - diagonal coupling , this work is thus hoped to shed new light on the emergence of interesting properties in the sub - ohmic regime of the sbm .",
    "we note that in the absence of bias and off - diagonal coupling , the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ ohami ] ) is invariant under the transformation of @xmath185 , @xmath14 @xmath186 @xmath187 and @xmath15 @xmath186 @xmath188 . in this case , there exist two degenerate ground states with differing magnetization characteristics , and their wave functions can then be used to form symmetric and anti - symmetric wave functions which are similar to the bloch states that are commonly employed in the study of the holstein model . very recently , bera _ et al . _",
    "have proposed a trial state  @xcite to describe the adiabatic response of the high frequency bosonic modes to the spin tunneling as well as non - classical correlations due to the low frequency modes . with the new ansatz , comparable results to those obtained with the nrg method were obtained , and new behavior in spin coherence and environmental entanglement was unveiled @xcite .",
    "our current approach could well be extended to incorporate the influence of an anti - polaron state via the symmetric and anti - symmetric wave functions .",
