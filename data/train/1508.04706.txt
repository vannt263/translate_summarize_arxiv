    "the paper is devoted to the analytical and numerical study of two connected questions : nonlinear eigenproblems with a bang - bang term and optimization of quasi-(normal-)eigenvalues in optical and mechanical resonators .",
    "a leaky cavity ( or resonator ) is a region of space within which the electromagnetic ( or acoustic ) field is well confined , but not completely confined .",
    "cavities supporting eigenmodes with high quality factor ( high - q ) are needed for a number of applications including cavity quantum electrodynamics , optical engineering , and microscopy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the recent progress in fabrication of small size optical resonators @xcite attracted considerable interest to numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite aspects of resonance optimization .",
    "optical quasi - eigenvalues ( or resonances ) can be mathematically defined as eigenvalues @xmath13 corresponding to outgoing solutions of the time - harmonic maxwell equation @xcite .",
    "because of the leakage , resonant eigenoscillations are expected to decay exponentially in time . the modulus of the imaginary part @xmath14 of a quasi - eigenvalue corresponds to _ the decay rate _ of the standing wave , the real part @xmath15 to _ the frequency of oscillations_. in engineering studies , the confinement of energy for a particular resonant eigenmode is measured by _ the quality factor _ @xmath16 .",
    "since light is essentially difficult to localize it is hard to realize small - sized optical cavities with strong light confinement .",
    "one of the reasons of active involvement of numerics in this field is that the initial progress with fabrication of high - q cavities based on 2-d photonic crystals was achieved with the help of computer simulations of eigenmodes for perspective versions of design @xcite .",
    "the interest to multilayer structures with 1-d geometry has soon returned @xcite , partially because of cheaper fabrication process , partially because computations in this case are simpler . for idealized 1-d cavities with infinite layers and under the assumption of normally passing electromagnetic ( em ) waves , the maxwell system can be reduced to a 1 + 1 wave equation of nonhomogeneous string @xmath17 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the analogy with a string is widely used in optical engineering @xcite ( and possibly goes back to lord rayleigh ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) ) .",
    "quasi - eigenvalues associated with @xmath17 can be defined via the eigenproblem consisting of the time - harmonic equation @xmath18 equipped with radiation boundary conditions . in this 1-d case ,",
    "the radiation conditions take the @xmath13-dependent form of local conditions at the endpoints @xmath19    the following properties of the _ set @xmath20 of quasi - eigenvalues associated with the coefficient @xmath21 _ are important for the present paper : @xmath20 is a subset of the lower complex half - plane @xmath22 and is symmetric with respect to ( w.r.t . ) the imaginary axis @xmath23 , quasi - eigenvalues are isolated and of finite algebraic multiplicity , @xmath24 is their only possible accumulation point ( see section [ s mult and analyt ] and , for one - side open cases , @xcite ) .    from mathematical point of view , estimates on resonances associated with various wave equations have being studied in mathematical physics at least since 1970s @xcite and is still an active area of research ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "optimization of resonances may be seen as an attempt to obtain sharp estimates of this kind .",
    "this point of view and the study of resonances associated with random schrdinger operators were initial sources of the interest to the problem @xcite .",
    "it seems that , up to now , sharp estimates have been obtained only in low frequency regions for a few 1-d models involving total mass type constraints @xcite ( on a somewhat different problem involving damping , see @xcite and the discussion in @xcite ) . among other variational problems for eigenvalues",
    ", the optimization of resonances can be classified as the nonselfadjoint spectral optimization .",
    "it contains essentially new effects and difficulties in comparison with selfadjoint cases ( see @xcite ) .    since quasi - eigenvalues @xmath13 are complex numbers , one of the ways to formulate related variational problems is to interpret @xmath13 as an @xmath25-vector and to take the point of view of the optimization theory for vector - valued cost functions ( pareto optimization ) @xcite .",
    "the approach of @xcite is a development of that of @xcite , where the engineering problem of the high - q design for one - side open multilayer cavities was considered analytically . to provide a simple and simultaneously rigorous formulation , the papers @xcite restate the problem of high - q design in terms of the minimization of the decay rate @xmath14 for quasi - eigenvalues with a fixed frequency @xmath26",
    "then the set of all _ quasi - eigenvalues with minimal possible decay for their particular frequencies _",
    "forms a _ pareto optimal frontier _ ( see fig .  [ f drawing ] in section [ s opt problem ] and ( * ? ? ? * fig .  1 ) ) .",
    "the quasi - eigenvalues are supposed to be generated by cavities with structures belonging to a certain admissible family . in the present paper , the resonator s _ structure _",
    "is described by an @xmath27-function @xmath28 on @xmath29 $ ] ( @xmath30 ) , which represents spatially varying dielectric permittivities in the case of optical cavity , or the linear density in mechanics settings .",
    "boundary conditions at the endpoints @xmath31 , which describe the leakage of energy due to radiation or damping , include two parameters @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "these parameters are assumed to be fixed , and so , they do not participate in the optimization process . the admissible family of the structures @xmath33 ( over which the optimization is performed ) is defined by the functional side constraints @xmath0 a.e . on @xmath34 .",
    "this allows us to consider an important for applications situation when the resonator itself is only a part of a more complex device @xcite .",
    "that is , sometimes only some parts of the system are suitable for modifications to achieve better resonant properties .",
    "the part of the device that is not subjected to optimization corresponds to the intervals where @xmath35 .",
    "the connection between quasi - eigenvalues of minimal decay and nonlinear eigenproblems was established recently in @xcite for the case of 1-d models of one - side open resonators and constant side constraints @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it was proved that the set of pareto optimal quasi - eigenvalues of minimal decay belongs to the spectrum associated with the equation @xmath38 \\chicpl ( y^2 ( x ) ) \\right]$ ] .",
    "the nonlinearity contains the function of bang - bang type @xmath39 $ ] taken of the square of complex - valued solution @xmath40 . here and below @xmath4",
    "is the indicator ( characteristic ) function of the open upper complex half - plane @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 so @xmath43 equals @xmath44 on the @xmath45-intervals where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for @xmath45-intervals where @xmath48 .",
    "this resembles to some extend bang - bang equations arising in the optimal control theory when the control is restricted by a lower and an upper bound .",
    "however , the interpretation of the above equation from the point of view of control is not found yet .",
    "since the nonlinear equation derived in @xcite excludes infinite - dimensional unknown structure @xmath1 , it may essentially simplify computation of optimal resonances in comparison with step - by - step adjustment procedures for @xmath1 based on computation of electromagnetic field on each step .    development and analytic justification of a numerical procedure based on the bang - bang eigenproblem is one of the goals of our research .",
    "however , the implementation of this new computational approach requires better understanding of the shapes of the nonlinear spectrum and of the pareto optimal set , as well as their projections to the real line ( see section [ ss ex a ] ) .",
    "our method also requires the study of properties of solutions of the bang - bang equation ( [ e nonlin i ] ) , which are considered in section [ ss sinl=0 ] and appendix [ ss uni nl ] .",
    "we show that not only quasi - eigenvalues of minimal decay , but also quasi - eigenvalues locally extremal in a much wider sense belong to the set @xmath2 of eigenvalues associated with the nonlinear equation @xmath49 \\chicpl ( y^2 ( x ) ) \\right ] , \\quad a_1 < x < a_2\\ ] ] ( which includes the functional side constraints @xmath50 and is supposed to be equipped with the radiation boundary conditions ) . in particular , we show that _ nonlinear spectrum _ @xmath2 contains the nonimaginary part @xmath51 \\setminus \\ii \\rr$ ] of the boundary @xmath51 $ ] of the _ set of admissible quasi - eigenvalues _",

    "we also show that @xmath51 $ ] and so @xmath2 are , at least in some cases , essentially ` greater ' than the set of quasi - eigenvalues of minimal decay ( see sections [ s small cont ] and [ s numex ] and example [ ex interior ] ) .",
    "the quasi - eigenvalue of minimal decay for a particular frequency @xmath54 can be found as the closest to @xmath55 point of the intersection of the nonlinear spectrum with the line @xmath56 ( see section [ s finding ] ) .",
    "then , corresponding optimal structures @xmath1 can also be found from the bang - bang eigenproblem . in the end of the paper",
    ", we support our study by a numerical experiment ( see fig .",
    "[ f snl ] ( a ) and tables 1 - 2 in section [ s numex ] ) .    to prove rigorously that points of the nonlinear spectrum are not necessarily quasi - eigenvalues of minimal decay , the case of small dielectric contrast is considered in section [ s small cont ] . in optics",
    "literature the study of small contrast is often serves as a base of intuitive understanding of qualitative effects ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) ) . in the optimization settings ,",
    "small contrast means that the constraints @xmath36 and @xmath57 are close to each other . to measure the corresponding distance we use the @xmath27-norm @xmath58 since this choice is flexible enough to cover both the small changes in permittivity function ( when @xmath59 is small ) and fluctuations in the widths and positions of layers",
    "this gives a connection with models involving uncertainties or random deviations in the resonator s structure @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , for stochastic models , all possible positions of random resonances ( the supports of probabilistic distributions ) can be localized by the set of admissible resonances @xmath60 $ ] of a properly posed optimization problem . in practical situations uncertainties or fluctuations in the cavity s structure",
    "may model unintended deviations in fabrication process @xcite , incorporation of biomolecular thin films in x - ray multi - layer cavities @xcite , and various physics effects affecting em properties of materials @xcite .",
    "pure imaginary quasi - eigenvalues ( i.e. , the case @xmath61 ) correspond to the over - damping and critical damping effects ( in mechanics settings ) . for them , optimization partially resembles that for selfadjoint problems @xcite .",
    "the pure imaginary case is considered separately in section [ s 0fr ] .",
    "it provides , as a by - product , an example of two different optimal structures associated with one quasi - eigenvalue of minimal decay .",
    "this partially answers the uniqueness of optimizer question discussed in @xcite .",
    "the application of steepest ascent numerical procedures to the search of quasi - eigenvalues with locally minimal decay rate ( or locally maximal quality factor ) attracted a considerable attention @xcite .",
    "it seems that corollary [ c const b12 0 adm ] ( i ) and theorem [ t small diel contrast ] provide _ first rigorous proofs of existence of such local minimizers_. ( the proof of theorem [ t small diel contrast ] can be easily transformed to consider local maximizers for the q - factor ) .",
    "_ the existence of global minimizer for decay rate _ ( over all @xmath62 and @xmath63 such that @xmath64 ) _ is questionable_. our opinion is that it is difficult to expect such existence in most of practical situations , see the discussion in section [ ss globmin ] .",
    "the discussion section ( section [ s dis ] ) also compares the results of the numerical experiment of section [ s numex ] with optimal design suggestions of engineering and numerical optimization papers .",
    "our conclusion is that the gradually size - modulated 1-d stack designs of @xcite are reasonable , but for symmetric resonators , it is possible that _ an additional defect in the center may improve the confinement of energy . _",
    "the results of the paper were partially reported at the international congress of mathematicians ( seoul icm 2014 ) and in several seminar and workshop talks at the university of lbeck , the institute of mathematics ( at kiev ) , b.  verkin institute for low temperature physics and engineering , and pidstryhach institute for applied problems of mechanics and mathematics .",
