    "a _ periodic framework _ is an infinite planar structure , periodic with respect to a lattice representing @xmath0 , made of _ fixed - length bars _ connected by joints with full rotational degrees of freedom ; the allowed continuous motions are those that preserve the lengths and connectivity of the bars , and the framework s @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "a periodic framework is _ rigid _ if the only allowed motions are euclidean isometries , and flexible otherwise .",
    "the forced periodicity is a key feature of this model : there are structures that are rigid with respect to periodicity - preserving motions that are flexible if a larger class of motions is allowed .",
    "what is _ not _ required to be preserved is also noteworthy : the lattice is allowed to change as the framework moves .    formally , a periodic framework is given by a triple @xmath1 where : @xmath2 is a simple infinite graph ; @xmath3 is a free @xmath4-action on @xmath2 such that the quotient is finite ; and @xmath5 assigns a length to each edge of @xmath6 .",
    "a _ realization _ @xmath7 of a periodic framework @xmath1 is defined to be a mapping @xmath8 of the vertex set @xmath9 into @xmath10 and a matrix @xmath11 representing @xmath4 onto translations of @xmath10 such that :    * the @xmath0-action on the plane induced by @xmath11 represents the @xmath0-action @xmath3 on @xmath2 ; i.e. , @xmath12 for all @xmath13 and @xmath14 . *",
    "the specified edge lengths are preserved by @xmath8 ; i.e. , @xmath15 for all edges @xmath16 .",
    "the reader should note that together these definitions imply that , to be realizable , an abstract periodic framework must give the same length to each @xmath0-orbit of edges .",
    "a realization @xmath7 is _ rigid _ if the only allowed continuous motions of @xmath8 and @xmath11 that preserve the action @xmath3 and the edge lengths are rigid motions of the plane and _ flexible _ otherwise .",
    "if @xmath7 is rigid but ceases to be so if any @xmath4-orbit of edges in @xmath6 is removed it is minimally rigid .",
    "these definitions of periodic frameworks and rigidity are from @xcite .",
    "( see section [ section : continuous ] for complete details . )",
    "the topic of this paper is to determine rigidity and flexibility of periodic frameworks based only on the__combinatorics _ _ of a framework  i.e .",
    ", which bars are present and not their specific lengths . in general , this is nt possible , and even testing rigidity of a _",
    "framework seems to be a hard problem , with the best known algorithms relying on exponential - time grbner basis computations .    however , for _ generic _ periodic frameworks , we give the following combinatorial characterization , which is analogous to the landmark maxwell - laman theorem @xcite .",
    "the _ colored - laman graphs _ appearing in statements of theorems are defined in section [ section : tdngraphs ] ; the quotient graph is defined in section [ section : graphs ] ; and genericity is defined precisely in section [ section : infinitesimal ] in terms of the coordinates of the points in a realization avoiding a nowhere - dense algebraic set . in particular , this means that the set non - generic realizations has measure zero .",
    "[ theo : periodiclaman ] let @xmath1 be a generic periodic framework .",
    "then a generic realization @xmath17 of @xmath1 is minimally rigid if and only if its quotient graph @xmath18 is colored - laman .",
    "we note that theorem [ theo : periodiclaman ] is a true combinatorial characterization of generic periodic rigidity in the plane : @xmath18 is a finite combinatorial object and the colored - laman condition is checkable in polynomial time .",
    "the specialization of theorem [ theo : periodiclaman ] to the case where the quotient graph has only one vertex is implied by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.12 ) .      because infinite periodic graphs are unwieldy to work with , we will model periodic frameworks by _ colored graphs _ , which are finite directed graphs with elements of @xmath0 on the edges .",
    "these are defined in section [ section : graphs ] , but we show some examples here to give intuition and motivate theorem [ theo : periodiclaman ] .",
    "figure [ fig : points - example ] ( a ) shows part of a periodic point set , ( b ) makes it more clear that it is indeed periodic by indicating the @xmath0 orbits of the points ; ( c ) indicates the vectors representing @xmath0 by translations and shows several copies of the fundamental domain of the @xmath0-action on the plane ( often called the unit cell ) .",
    "figure [ fig : framework - example ]  ( a ) shows an example of a periodic framework , and ( b ) and ( c ) illustrate the construction from moving from a periodic framework to a colored graphs from which the entire periodic graph formed by the bars of the framework can be reconstructed .",
    "see section [ section : graphs ] for a detailed description of the construction .",
    "the framework in figure [ fig : framework - example ] turns out to be generically rigid , and , in fact , over - constrained .",
    "this is because the colored graph in figure [ fig : framework - example ] ( c ) has @xmath19 vertices and @xmath20 edges . on the other hand ,",
    "there are @xmath21 total variables defining the framework ( @xmath22 from the coordinates of the points and @xmath23 from the representation of the lattice ) and @xmath24 trivial degrees of freedom ( from euclidean motions of the plane ) , so there can be only @xmath25 independent distance equations . since the graph in figure [ fig : framework - example ] ( c ) is somewhat complicated , seeing that the framework from figure [ fig : framework - example ] ( a ) is rigid is most easily done via theorem [ theo : periodiclaman ] .",
    "figure [ fig : framework - example ] ( d ) indicates a subgraph corresponding to a minimally rigid framework in gray ; this is what we call _ colored - laman_.    figure [ fig : flex - framework ] example shows an example of a very simple one degree of freedom framework ( a ) and its associated colored graph ( c ) .",
    "two things to note are : its flex ( b ) necessarily moves the representation of the lattice ; in this rigidity model _ all _ @xmath23-regular colored graphs are associated with frameworks that , generically , have at least one degree of freedom .",
    "our final example , in figure [ fig : dependent - framework ] is a simple illustration of a subtle feature of the periodic rigidity model that the colored - laman graphs we define capture : dependencies between disconnected sub - frameworks and sub - graphs .",
    "the framework in figure [ fig : dependent - framework ] ( a ) consists of two disconnected orbits of bars , each of which is modeled by a self - loop in the associated colored graph shows in figure [ fig : dependent - framework ] ( b ) . to be realizable at all , the lengths of the bars all need to be exactly the same : in both cases , what is being restricted is just the length of one of the lattice vectors .",
    "it follows that , generically , this framework is over - constrained , despite not being connected and its quotient graph not being connected .",
    "accounting for the interactions between sub - frameworks that affect the same parts of the lattice representation is a key aspect of the definition of colored - laman graphs .",

    "we follow the general program for proving maxwell - laman - type theorems via direction network realization results set out by streinu and theran @xcite .",
    "let us first briefly sketch how theorem [ theo : periodicparallel ] implies theorem [ theo : periodiclaman ] .",
    "all known proofs of `` maxwall - laman - type '' theorems ( such as theorem [ theo : periodiclaman ] ) proceed via a linearization of the problem called _ infinitesimal rigidity _",
    ", which is concerned with the rank of the _ rigidity matrix _ @xmath35 .",
    "the rigidity matrix depends on the quotient graph @xmath18 of the periodic framework .",
    "( see section [ section : infinitesimal ] for the detailed definitions and the full argument ) .",
    "the two main steps are to prove that for a quotient graph with @xmath36 vertices and @xmath37 edges :    * if @xmath35 has rank @xmath38 then the associated framework is rigid .",
    "( this is the main result of @xcite . ) * for almost all frameworks ( these are called _ generic _ ) with quotient graph @xmath18 having @xmath36 vertices and @xmath38 edges , the rank of @xmath35 is @xmath38 if and only of @xmath18 is colored - laman .    the second step , where the rank of the rigidity matrix is proved from only a combinatorial assumption is the ( more difficult ) `` laman direction , '' and it occupies most of this paper .",
    "the approach is as follows :    * we begin with a matrix @xmath39 , arising from periodic direction network that has non - zero entries in same positions as the rigidity matrix , but simpler entries ( vectors @xmath40 instead of difference of points @xmath41 ) .",
    "the rank of @xmath39 is much easier to analyze directly .",
    "* then we apply theorem [ theo : periodicparallel ] to a colored - laman graph @xmath18 . for generic directions @xmath42 ( defined in section [ section : directions ] ) , there is a point set @xmath8 and a lattice @xmath11 such that @xmath41 is in the direction of @xmath43 and the two endpoints of every edge are different . substituting in the @xmath44 recovers the rigidity matrix from @xmath35 from @xmath39 , completing the proof .    the main task , then , is to prove theorem [ theo : periodicparallel ] .",
    "this proceeds in three distinct steps :    * the combinatorial step : * we begin by defining periodic and colored graphs ( section [ section : graphs ] ) .",
    "sections [ section : colored - laman][section : cloning ] define and develop our central combinatorial objects : _ colored - laman _ and _ @xmath45-colored - graphs_. our main combinatorial results are that :    * @xmath45-periodic - graph give the bases of a matroid ( lemma [ lemma:222matroid ] ) .",
    "* @xmath45-colored graphs have an alternate characterization via a sparsity - certifying decomposition into edge - disjoint subgraphs ( lemma [ lemma:222decomp ] ) . *",
    "colored - laman graphs are related to @xmath45-colored - graphs by doubling an edge ( lemma [ lemma : periodiclamancontract ] ) .    *",
    "the natural representation step : * in sections [ section : natural][section:22k - rep ] we prove that the matroid that has @xmath45-colored graphs as its bases admits a _ natural representation _ : i.e. , for a periodic graph @xmath18 with @xmath36 vertices and @xmath46 edges , there is a matrix @xmath39 that has rank @xmath46 if and only if @xmath18 is @xmath45-colored .",
    "the decomposition lemma [ lemma:222decomp ] lets us study @xmath39 in terms of highly structured minors for which it is easier to give exact determinant formulas .",
    "* the geometric step : * sections [ section : directions][section : parallel ] develop the geometric theory of periodic direction networks and gives the proof of theorem [ theo : periodicparallel ] .",
    "the equations giving the edge directions are closely related to the natural representation matrix @xmath39 , which allows us to combinatorially predict the generic rank .",
    "to understand the geometry of a generic direction network s realization space , we make a connection between collapsed edges in a realization and doubling of edges , bringing us back , in a natural way to colored - laman graphs .      the question of generic rigidity and flexibility of periodic frameworks has been studied in the past .",
    "the first result of which we are aware is by walter whiteley @xcite , who showed ( in our language ) that there are colored graphs which lead to infinitesimally rigid periodic frameworks if the representation of the lattice is fixed .",
    "elissa ross @xcite proved , using methods quite different from ours , the analogue of theorem [ theo : periodiclaman ] when the lattice representation is fixed .",
    "our proof of theorem [ theo : periodicparallel ] is essentially algebraic , but the geometric correspondence between _ parallel redrawings _ of finite frameworks ( which are vertex displacements preserving the edge directions ) and _ infinitesimal motions _",
    "( which preserve the lengths of the bars to first order , see section [ section : infinitesimal ] ) has a long history as a folklore tool in engineering .",
    "the reason for this is that it is easier to see a non - trivial parallel redrawing than the associated infinitesimal motion .",
    "whiteley developed the subject ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) and its generalizations to higher - dimensional _ scene analysis _",
    "* section 8) , and the idea of deducing the maxwell - laman theorem from a direct proof of the parallel redrawing theorem appears in @xcite .",
    "the _ colored - laman _ and _ colored-@xmath45 graphs _ we define in section [ section : tdngraphs ] are an extension of the well - studied families of _ @xmath47-sparse _ @xcite graphs : these are defined by the property that any subgraph spanning @xmath48 edges and @xmath49 vertices satisfies @xmath50 . all known generic rigidity characterizations ( e.g. , @xcite ) are in terms of @xmath47-sparse graphs with specialized parameters for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the combinatorial theory we develop in section [ section : tdngraphs ] is a generalization of @xmath47-sparsity , and runs in parallel to parts of it :    * lemma [ lemma : periodiclamancontract ] , which relates colored - laman graphs to colored-@xmath45 graphs by edge doubling is a colored graph version of theorems of lovsz - yemini @xcite and recski @xcite . *",
    "the decomposition lemma [ lemma:222decomp ] is analogous to the nash - williams - tutte theorem @xcite , and we use it in a similar manner to the way @xcite and @xcite use nash - williams - tutte .",
    "another way to view our @xmath0-graded - sparse graphs is in terms of constructions on matroids . to make the connection clear",
    ", we give an outline of our proof in these terms :    * we argue directly that @xmath53-graphs are the bases of a matroid with a specific rank function ( lemma [ lemma : fmat ] ) . *",
    "that @xmath45-graphs give the bases of a matroid ( lemma [ lemma:222matroid ] ) and the associated decomposition follows from the nash - williams matroid construction .",
    "* the colored - laman matroid can then be obtained via dilworth truncation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.7 ) , which , in terms of submodular functions means going from @xmath54 to @xmath55 as the function generating the matroid .    for linearly representable matroids , matroid union and dilworth truncation both",
    "have counterparts in terms of the representation .",
    "these are :    * adding a new block to the representing matrix with the same filling pattern but different generic variables , for matroid union ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 7.16.4 ) ) .",
    "* confining the rows of the representing matrix to lie in a generic hyperplane , for dilworth truncation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the subtlety , for us , is that we are after a _ specific _ representation for the colored - laman graph matroid , namely the rigidity matrix @xmath56 .",
    "this means that we need an argument specific to our geometric setting , and not just general results on dilworth truncation .      in what follows @xmath57",
