    "after the advent of relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , much attention has been paid for the properties of matter near and above the critical temperature of qcd phase transition , @xmath1 . to understand the structure of the matter in this region , it is desirable to identify the basic degrees of freedom of the system and their excitation properties . in the present study",
    ", we analyze the spectral properties of quarks , which are one of the fundamental degrees of freedom of qcd , at finite temperature above and below @xmath1 using quenched lattice qcd with clover improved fermions @xcite .    at asymptotically high temperatures",
    ", one can calculate the quark propagator using perturbative techniques .",
    "it is known that the collective excitations of quarks in this limit develop a mass gap ( thermal mass ) that is proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath0 denote the gauge coupling and temperature , respectively @xcite . moreover , in this limit the number of poles in the quark propagator is doubled ; in addition to the normal modes , which reduce to poles in the free particle propagator , plasmino modes appear .    in order to see the properties of quark spectral function @xmath4 in this limit ,",
    "let us first consider the spectral function at zero momentum .",
    "in this case , the dirac structure of @xmath4 can be decomposed using the projection operators @xmath5 as @xmath6 while @xmath7 for free quarks are given by @xmath8 , in the high temperature limit one obtains @xmath9 /2 $ ] , where @xmath10 is the thermal mass .",
    "the two poles at @xmath11 correspond to the normal and plasmino modes .",
    "the dirac structure of @xmath4 in the high temperature limit is also decomposed as @xmath12 with the projection operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the spectral functions @xmath15 in the high temperature limit read @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the contribution of the continuum taking non - zero values in the space - like region , and poles at @xmath18 and @xmath19 corresponds to the normal and plasmino modes , respectively .",
    "the dispersion relation of the plasmino has a minimum at nonzero @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "in this section , we analyze the quark spectral function for zero momentum but with finite bare quark mass on the lattice .",
    "we use gauge field ensembles which have been generated and used previously by the bielefeld group to study screening masses and spectral functions @xcite .",
    "the quark spectral function in this case is decomposed into @xmath7 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho^m ] ) . in order to extract the spectral function @xmath21 from the lattice correlation function",
    ", we assume a simple ansatz for the shape of @xmath21 including few fitting parameters . we found that the two - pole ansatz for @xmath21 , @xmath22 reproduces the lattice correlator quite well , where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are fitting parameters determined from the correlated fit . the pole at @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2pole ] ) corresponds to the plasmino mode .",
    "the success of two - pole ansatz for the quark correlation functions suggests that the positions of the poles of the quark propagator would be near the real axis at @xmath26 and @xmath27 with small imaginary parts .",
    "provided that the positions of poles of the propagator are gauge independent , this also indicates that our results on the fitting parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 have small gauge dependence .     and the relative strength of the plasmino mode , @xmath30 , at @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 obtained from calculations on lattice of size @xmath34 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ze ] , we show the dependence of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 on the bare quark mass , @xmath35 , for @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 obtained from calculations on lattices of size @xmath34 .",
    "the figure shows that the ratio @xmath36 becomes larger with decreasing @xmath35 and eventually reaches @xmath37 irrespective of @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical result for each @xmath0 shows that @xmath38 is satisfied within statistical errors there .",
    "these results mean that the quark propagator is chirally symmetric at this point @xcite . moreover , @xmath21 at this point has the same form as the spectral function in the high temperature limit .",
    "we therefore define the thermal mass of the quark on the lattice as @xmath39 at this point .",
    "one finds that the ratio @xmath40 is insensitive to @xmath0 in the range analyzed in this work , although it becomes slightly larger with decreasing @xmath0 , which would be in accordance with the expected parametric form at high temperature , @xmath41 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ze ] also shows that the relative strength of the plasmino pole , @xmath42 , decreases with increasing values of the bare mass , @xmath35 .",
    "the spectral function @xmath21 thus will eventually be dominated by a single - pole .",
    "this result agrees with the perturbative result in yukawa models that @xmath21 approaches the spectral function of free quarks as the bare quarks mass becomes larger @xcite .    for @xmath43",
    ", we found that the lattice correlator is concave in the log - scale plot .",
    "this behavior indicates that the positivity condition of @xmath21 is violated below @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , we have checked that the two - pole ansatz eq .",
    "( [ eq:2pole ] ) gives unacceptably large @xmath44 below @xmath1 .",
    "it is also found that the quark correlator does not approach the chirally symmetric one even in the chiral limit , in contrast to the previous result for @xmath45 .",
    "these results for @xmath43 seem consistent with a nave picture that quark excitations are confined and the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken below @xmath1 .",
    "and @xmath29 and the ratio @xmath42 on the lattice momentum @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath33 . ]",
    "next let us analyze the quark spectral function at finite momentum on lattices with size @xmath34 for @xmath47 and @xmath33 . throughout this section",
    "we consider the quark propagator in the chiral limit .",
    "the quark propagator in the chiral limit is decomposed into @xmath48 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho^p ] ) .",
    "following the same approach used in the previous section , we adopt the two - pole ansatz @xmath49 and determine four parameters from a correlated fit .",
    "the @xmath50-functions at @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to the normal and plasmino modes , respectively .",
    "we found that @xmath51 with this ansatz is always smaller than @xmath32 for all momenta analyzed in this study .",
    "this result means that the two - pole ansatz again reproduces the lattice correlation function well .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : p>0 ] , we show the momentum dependence of the fitting parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath42 for @xmath47 and @xmath33 .",
    "the horizontal axis represents the momentum on the lattice @xmath52 .",
    "the figure shows that for large momentum @xmath42 rapidly decreases and @xmath28 approaches the light cone .",
    "the spectral function at large momentum therefore approaches that of a free quark , consistent with the perturbative result .",
    "one also finds that @xmath29 is always smaller than @xmath28 , in contrast to the results in the previous section .",
    "this behavior qualitatively agrees with the behavior of poles in the high @xmath0 limit @xcite .",
    "one also observes from fig .",
    "[ fig : p>0 ] that @xmath29 enters the space - like region at high momentum .",
    "an interesting property of the quark propagator in the high temperature limit eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho^p_htl ] ) is that the dispersion relation of the plasmino has a minimum at finite momentum . in fig .",
    "[ fig : p>0 ] , one sees that the value of @xmath29 at lowest non - zero momentum on our lattice , @xmath53 , is slightly larger than that at zero momentum , and the existence of such a minimum is suggested but not yet confirmed in the present analysis .    in summary",
    ", we analyzed the dependence of the quark spectral function on temperature @xmath0 , bare quark mass @xmath54 , and momentum @xmath20 in quenched lattice qcd with landau gauge fixing .",
    "above @xmath1 , we found that the two - pole approximations for the spectral functions in the projected channels , @xmath7 and @xmath48 , can well reproduce the lattice correlation functions .",
    "although further studies on the volume dependence is needed , this result indicates that the excitations of quarks have small decay width even near @xmath1 . below @xmath1 ,",
    "on the other hand , the two - pole ansatz fails completely .",
