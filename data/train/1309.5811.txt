    "recent dramatic progress in laser technology has given rise to new projects ( e.g. , eli , xfel ) which may bring intensities of the order of 10@xmath0 - 10@xmath1 w@xmath2 within reach @xcite .",
    "this opens up a wide range of possibilities for exploring novel regimes of ultraintense laser - matter interactions @xcite .",
    "the main feature of such interactions is that the radiation reaction ( rr ) effects @xcite coming into play may strongly modify the conventional relativistic laser - plasma interactions .",
    "first attempts to consider such ultra - relativistic interactions accounting for the radiation reaction force were recently made by using particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations , particularly showing the qualitative difference between linear and circular polarization of the driving field @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on fundamentally new features of self - consistent ultra - relativistic laser plasma interactions .",
    "we pay particular attention to the circularly polarized lasers when electrodynamic description of the interaction can be simplified essentially , providing exact solutions for plasma - field structures .",
    "for those , we derive fundamental definitions , such as nonlinear dielectric permittivity , ponderomotive and dissipative forces acting on an electron at such ultrahigh intensities . besides , based on these treatments an effective plasma converter of laser energy into gamma rays is also proposed .",
    "to provide a self - consistent approach to ultra - relativistic laser plasma interaction by using macroscopic electrodynamic description ( see , for example , @xcite ) we should first clearly define the relationship between macroscopic fields , averaged over small physical volume , and local fields , acting on a particle situated at this point . in conventional electrodynamics of a plasma where the radiation reaction effect is not taken into account",
    "these forces are equal ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and what is also important is that these fields at the given point are produced by all other particles except the one situated at this point . using this statement",
    "we may incorporate the radiation reaction effect into macroscopic electrodynamics just by replacing in the single particle motion @xmath3 external fields @xmath4 , @xmath5 by macroscopic fields @xmath6 , @xmath7 , which are produced by all other particles and these fields ( as well including external fields ) are governed by the maxwell equations with the corresponding charges and currents ; usually the same procedure is used in pic modeling .",
    "radiation reaction force can be taken in the lorentz - abraham - dirac ( lad ) form or landau - lifshitz one ; this was much discussed in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "detailed comparative analysis of single particle motion in a laser field was done in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for considering the ultra - relativistic laser plasma interaction",
    "when the rr effects are of importance we employ the most simple approach based on relativistic hydrodynamic equations describing the motion of a cold electron fluid accounting for the rr force in the lorentz - abraham - dirac ( lad ) form : @xmath8\\right\\ } , \\label{lad}\\\\ \\frac{d n_e}{d t}+ n_e\\nabla\\cdot{\\bf v}=0\\label{cont } , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where , instead of electric and magnetic fields , we introduced vector @xmath9 and @xmath10 scalar potentials , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the full time derivative , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the electron charge and mass , respectively , @xmath16 is the electron momentum , @xmath17 is the electron velocity , @xmath18 is the relativistic factor , @xmath19 is the speed of light , @xmath20 is the electron density .",
    "this approach is also justified by the fact that , at extremely high intensities of interest rr acts as a cooling mechanism ( see , for example , @xcite ) essentially lowering electron temperature as compared to the case when rr is not included . adopting the coulomb gauge ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath9 describes the vortex electromagnetic field , and @xmath10 describes the electrostatic field due to charge separation in the plasma for which the maxwell equations reduce to @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the unperturbed plasma density . the fluid model , representing a significant simplification over a full kinetic treatment based on particle - in - cell simulations or the vlasov equation but retaining enough physics to be qualitatively and quantitatively useful@xcite , without the rr force was widely used in the conventional relativistic interactions , particularly to study fundamentally new properties of the interaction .",
    "the three well known examples related to the case of circularly polarized electromagnetic wave are : ( i ) the propagation of intense plane wave due to the relativistic mass correction @xcite , ( ii ) exact solutions for plasma - field structures in the regime of relativistic self - induced transparency ( sit ) describing the penetration of incident radiation into overdense plasmas @xcite , and ( iii ) electromagnetic solitons of relativistically strong laser fields propagating in underdense and also in overdense plasmas @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using circular polarization is that the ponderomotive force has no oscillating ( with double laser frequency ) component and therefore pushes electrons steadily without significant electron heating .",
    "recently by taking this advantage several schemes for laser ion acceleration into gev energy range were proposed @xcite .",
    "next we will also use this advantage but consider the case of importance of rr effects . paying particular attention to the one - dimensional problem and quasisteady model as well",
    ", we assume that the longitudinal motion is frozen , so that in a circularly polarized field @xmath24 $ ] ( @xmath25 is the laser frequency ) the electron velocity can also be taken in the form @xmath26 $ ] @xcite , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the complex functions . substituting them into eq .",
    "( [ lad ] ) for radiation reaction force we obtain @xmath29 where the parameter responsible for the rr effects is @xmath30 , which is approximately equal to 10@xmath31 for a 1 @xmath32 m wavelength .",
    "it is worth noting that similar procedure can also be applied by considering the friction force in the form of landau - lifshitz @xcite instead of the lad form as in eq .",
    "( [ lad ] ) , but for the latter algebraic operations are much simpler . and",
    "as well , in spite of the fact that the lad force may lead to unphysical self - accelerated solutions for the single - electron interaction problem , in our case of a harmonic process no qualitatively new solutions are added . for convenience of notation let us introduce the following dimensionless variables and parameters : longitudinal coordinate ( along the propagation direction ) @xmath33 , vector @xmath34 and scalar @xmath35 potentials , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the ratio of unperturbed plasma density @xmath23 over the critical one at given laser frequency , the ratio @xmath38 will be denoted as @xmath39 . in this case",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) on the transverse projection gives @xmath40 whereas on the longitudinal one it arrive at @xmath41,\\label{force}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "it should be emphasized that equation ( [ force ] ) indicates that in the region where the electron density @xmath43 the force of a longitudinal field due to charge separation is compensated by a sum of two forces ; the first one is the ponderomotive force @xcite and the second one is a dissipative force due to the rr effect , which is generally caused by the imaginary part of dielectric permittivity .",
    "the medium absorbs laser photons thus additionally acquiring an impulse along laser propagation direction . from eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) we can also obtain an explicit expression of relativistic factor @xmath44 as a function of field amplitude @xmath45 . multiplying this equation by the complex conjugate term we arrive at the fourth order algebraic equation with respect to @xmath46",
    "( see also @xcite ) : @xmath47 where we used @xmath48 .",
    "this equation has two complex conjugate roots , one is negative and the positive root , suitable for @xmath46 only , is given below : @xmath49 where @xmath50^{-1/3}+\\frac{[s+(s^2 + 54q^3)^{1/2}]^{1/3 } } { 2^{1/3}3\\delta^2 } , \\\\",

    "[ gamma ] for both cases with and without the rr force clearly indicating lowering of the energy of the electron due to its radiation losses at @xmath51 .        similar way we rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ wave ] ) and ( [ puisson ] ) arriving at @xmath52a=0,\\label{a}\\\\ \\phi''=n_0(n_e-1).\\label{phi}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] thus the set of equations ( [ force ] ) , ( [ a ] ) , ( [ phi ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ gama ] ) represent the full set of self - consistent ordinary equations describing plasma - field structures that can be realised during ultra - relativistic laser plasma interaction .",
    "it should be noted that ion dynamics is neglected here .",
    "although the main reason is simplicity , at extreme field intensities in plasmas as high as 10@xmath0 w@xmath2 electron dynamics , as follows from simulations , is much faster than ion dynamics .    summarizing the above consideration",
    "we underline that in comparison with the conventional relativistic interaction ( @xmath53 ) , the set of equations ( [ force ] ) , ( [ gama ] ) - ( [ phi ] ) has two fundamentally new features .",
    "the first one follows from eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) describing the laser - plasma equilibrium when the quasistatic force due to charge separation ( left side ) compensates the action from the laser wave comprising the ponderomotive force ( the first term in the right - hand side ) and a new one , dissipative force arising from the laser energy absorption in the rr processes ( the second term ) . in the case of single electron motion the latter force is responsible for electron acceleration due to the rr effect ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) is an exact expression for ponderomotive and dissipative forces arising from the laser fields acting onto the plasma .",
    "the second feature is in the wave equation ( [ a ] ) in which there appeared an imaginary part , which indicates the importance of absorption processes due to the rr effects .",
    "let us now apply these equations to particular problems of interest .",
    "to begin with , we consider a very instructive example of a homogeneous plasma ( @xmath54 ) . in this case , considering equation ( [ a ] ) for the laser field only and assuming @xmath55 we can obtain the standard nonlinear dispersion relation @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 is the wavevector of a plane electromagnetic wave ) with the following expression for dielectric permittivity @xmath58 which contains real and imaginary parts . at @xmath59 , as is expected , the imaginary part goes to zero whereas the real one reduces to the conventional relativistic dielectric permittivity @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the qualitative contribution of the rr effects is in the imaginary part , i.e. , in the plasma conductivity @xmath61 that appeared due to laser energy absorption caused by the re - emission of photons . for estimates ,",
    "the imaginary part is comparable with the plasma contribution to the real part ( @xmath62 ) at @xmath63 , i.e. , at @xmath64 .    by introducing a single particle scattering cross - section through its definition as the energy absorbed in a volume unit , @xmath65 , being equal to the incident flux energy , @xmath66 , multiplying by @xmath67 , where @xmath20 is the number of scatters , i.e. , electrons",
    ", we can easily obtain an exact expression for the relativistic tompson scattering cross - section @xmath68 : @xmath69 where @xmath70 ( @xmath71 is the electron radius ) is the tompson scattering cross - section . if in the @xmath72 range we obtain the well - known formula @xmath73 , whereas for a much higher amplitude @xmath74 the scattering cross - section decreases as @xmath75 .",
    "the next also very instructive example is the interaction of electromagnetic waves with overdense plasmas , which are of interest from fundamental point of view and for applications .",
    "the most striking effect is the so - called relativistic self - induced transparency ( rsit ) effect when an incident relativistically strong electromagnetic wave is able to penetrate deep into overdense plasmas , which are otherwise opaque for low intensity waves @xcite . to study this effect at ultra - relativistic intensities at which the rr effects should be taken into account",
    "we will use eqs .",
    "( [ force ] ) , ( [ gama ] ) - ( [ phi ] ) where we assume @xmath76",
    ". then equation ( [ a ] ) for amplitude splits into two equations for the real functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xmath79u=0 , \\label{u}\\\\ ( u^2\\theta')'=\\delta\\gamma\\frac{n_0n_e u^2}{1+\\delta^2 \\gamma^6 } , \\label{flux}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which constitute together with eqs .",
    "( [ force ] ) , ( [ gama ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) a self - consistent set of ordinary equations .",
    "it is useful to note that eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) , expressing the electromagnetic energy conservation law , describes the energy flux decreasing along the propagation path due to radiation losses .",
    "this set of equations can be solved numerically assuming for the case of semi - infinite plasma that at @xmath80 the system is unperturbed , i.e. , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "an example of the plasma - field structures which describe the plasma electron compression and formation of nonlinear skin - layer distribution for the laser field is shown in fig .",
    "[ semi](a ) . an auxiliary curve ( brown dotted line ) , that is the difference of the forces @xmath83 acting on a probe electron from the laser and quasistatic field due to charge separation , help us to understand the physics behind the rsit effect .",
    "in fact , at increasing incident intensities this difference of the forces acting on boundary electrons is positive and all electrons are pushed deeper into plasma .",
    "however , the point where @xmath83 is equal to zero is moving to the boundary point . in the limiting case when this point exactly coincides with the boundary point corresponds to the threshold of the rsit effect @xcite .",
    "indeed , at higher incident intensities exceeding this threshold , skin - layer solutions do not exist any longer .",
    "moreover , boundary electrons are in unstable position , since small displacements from their position make the difference of the forces acting on them negative , which means that they will move towards the incident wave , thus allowing the wave to penetrate deeper into the plasma . in fig .",
    "[ semi](b ) we present the rsit threshold as a function of plasma density with and without the rr effects that shows a decrease in the threshold when the friction force is taken into account .",
    "physically this occurs due to arising of an additional , dissipative force [ second term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) ] giving the possibility to support such structures with lower incident intensities .          as the rr effects at ultrahigh laser intensities",
    "are directly connected with the generation of high energy photons , the very intriguing possibility is to use them in order to create very efficient converter of laser energy into gamma - rays . however , as shown in simulations @xcite and also clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ semi](c ) at incident intensities high enough to generate high energy photons by a single electron , the laser field inside the plasma is much smaller than the incident one .",
    "this happens due to the electrodynamic effect of laser interaction with plasma , i.e. , electron peaking by laser compression strongly reflects the incident wave resulting in appreciable decrease of electromagnetic fields in the plasma as shown in fig .",
    "[ semi](c ) , thereby strongly suppressing the rr effects .",
    "however , this obstacle might be overcome by using thin plasma layers ( thin foils ) and symmetrical irradiation from both sides .",
    "first , we should optimize foil parameter so that the laser field should be able to penetrate deep into electron region and , second , symmetrical irradiation should arrest longitudinal electron motion . to do so , we will solve numerically eqs .",
    "( [ force ] ) , ( [ gama ] ) , ( [ phi]),([u ] ) , and ( [ flux ] ) in the class of symmetrical solutions , i.e. , assuming that @xmath84 @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "the typical plasma - field structure realized during the interaction is shown in fig .",
    "[ foil](a ) that models the symmetrical irradiation of gold foil ( @xmath86 ) of 500 nm width .",
    "we see that in spite of high incident intensity of @xmath87 w@xmath2 the field in the electron region is relatively small ( @xmath88 )",
    ". strong reflection of the incident wave from the compressed electron layer ( compression factor is about 75 and the maximum electron density increases by several orders of magnitude reaching @xmath89 @xmath90 ) greatly suppresses the rr effects , thus gamma - rays are not generated in fact .",
    "whereas by carefully choosing foil parameters , such as plasma density and width with respect to the given laser intensity , plasma - field structures can be favourably modified as depicted in fig .  [ foil](b ) .",
    "in this case , for example , for an incident intensity of @xmath91 w@xmath2 and the same foil parameter as in fig .",
    "[ foil](a ) , being a single hump the electron layer experiences strong enough electromagnetic field for the rr effects to come into play .",
    "in fact , electron layer compressed by a factor of @xmath92 , reaching a very narrow width of @xmath93 and density of @xmath94 @xmath90 , is able to convert 45% of incident energy into high energy photons of 45 mev .",
    "w@xmath2 and ( b ) @xmath95 w@xmath2.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    based on the above results we may propose the following scheme of very efficient laser energy conversion into gamma - rays .",
    "a thin foil target , preferably consisting of heavy ions , should be irradiated symmetrically from opposite directions by counter - propagated laser pulses with ultra - relativistic intensities of about @xmath96-@xmath97 w/@xmath2 or more . by properly choosing the foil thickness at the given incident intensity",
    ", all compressed electrons will synchronically rotate in a narrow plane and produce synchrotron emission along instantaneous velocity .",
    "the diagram of radiation , rotating within this plane too , can also be very narrow in proportion to @xmath98 .",
    "such a very important issue of the gamma - ray source , which is essentially two - dimensional , can be used to collect high energy photons for applications by surrounding the gamma - ray radiated narrow electron layer by respective consumers as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ proposal](a ) . to show the efficiency of the method proposed",
    "we have performed a parametric scan over a range of foil parameters and laser intensities and calculated the energy absorbed due to rr effects over the electron layer as follows from eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ proposal](b ) we present the conversion efficiency defined as @xmath101 ( @xmath102 is the incident intensity ) as a function of the width of a gold foil that shows the maximum efficiency of 50% , which means that half of the laser energy can be converted into gamma - rays .",
    "in summary , we have studied the fundamental issues of ultra - relativistic laser - plasma interactions when the rr effects can play a crucial role .",
    "we paid particular attention to the case of circularly polarized lasers when electromagnetic forces acting along the propagation direction steadily shift electrons forwards , thus making the quasistationary approach suitable for analytical treatment .",
    "it allows us to give fundamental definitions such as nonlinear dielectric permittivity , ponderomotive and dissipative forces acting on a plasma in exact form .",
    "we have also determined plasma - field structures arising during ultra - relativistic interactions and shown that in optimal conditions of laser - foil interaction about 50% of laser energy may be converted into gamma - rays .",

    "<S> a simple electrodynamic model is developed to define plasma - field structures in self - consistent ultra - relativistic laser - plasma interactions when the radiation reaction effects come into play . </S>",
    "<S> an exact analysis of a circularly polarized laser interacting with plasmas is presented . </S>",
    "<S> we define fundamental notations such as nonlinear dielectric permittivity , ponderomotive and dissipative forces acting in a plasma . </S>",
    "<S> plasma - field structures arising during the ultra - relativisitc interactions are also calculated . </S>",
    "<S> based on these solutions we show that about 50% of laser energy can be converted into gamma - rays in the optimal conditions of laser - foil interaction . </S>"
