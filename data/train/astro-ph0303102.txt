    "though not discussed by @xcite , a visual inspection of the image also reveals a marginal emission signal from g3 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we find that g2 is at the redshift of the absorbers .",

    "based upon the thimm data , we find ( albeit less definitively ) that g3 is also located at the redshift of the absorbers . however , we are unable to argue a clear one  to  one association with one of the three absorption systems .",
    "we have no redshift information for the bright galaxy g1 , nor for the more amorphous g4 .",

    "we follow the general technique of @xcite . our goal is to place constraints on the chemical and ionization conditions of the absorbing gas .",

    "system by system , we constrain the ionization conditions and metallicities of components ( or `` clouds '' ) 112 , using their velocities as a kinematic template upon which to compare all the observed transitions in the hires , stis , and fos spectra . as found in @xcite , we know that the clouds have fairly low ionization conditions . that is , @xmath106  , with the ionization fractions of mg , fe , c , and si being dominated by singly ionized species .",
    "these clouds do not give rise to the bulk of the , and absorption ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we then model the residual absorption from these species ( i.e.  the observed absorption remaining in the spectra after accounting for the absorption predicted by the low  ionization cloud models ) as a separate zone of high  ionization , lower density gas .",
    "we explored single phase and multiphase photoionization models , single phase and multiphase collisional ionization models , and multiphase photo + collisional ionization models to describe high  ionization gas .",

    "the absorption in these velocity intervals could not be satisfactorily described within the allowed parameter spaces of models limited to low and high ionization phases .",

    "each model cloud has constant density and plane  parallel geometry .",
    "an important parameter describing each cloud model is the ionization parameter , @xmath107 , which is defined as the ratio of the incident ionizing photon density , @xmath108 , to the number density of hydrogen , @xmath109 . for the photoionizing flux , we used the extragalactic ultraviolet spectrum of @xcite .",

    "alternatives to a solar pattern were explored as suggested by the data .",
    "input parameters to cloudy included : i ) the observed or estimated column density of a well constrained transition , ii ) the metallicity , @xmath113 ( expressed in units of the solar value ) , iii ) the ionization parameter , @xmath107 , and iv ) the abundance pattern . for each model cloud , we record the column density of transitions typically found in qso absorption line systems that were covered by our spectra ( i.e.including transitions not formally detected and not presented in figures  [ fig : data1 ] and [ fig : data2 ] ) .",
    "we also record the kinetic temperature , @xmath114 , which we equate with the thermal component of the doppler parameter , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the ion mass .    we assume a turbulent component to the doppler parameter in cases where the model cloud temperature implies a smaller value than what is measured in the spectra .",
    "this turbulent component , which we assume is identical for all species , was calculated using @xmath117 , where `` turb '' and `` therm '' denote the turbulent and thermal components , respectively .",
    "we then have the ingredients to estimate the `` total '' doppler parameter for any observed transitions by inverting this relation using the appropriate ion mass .",
    "we converge on the range of metallicity and ionization conditions by an iterative process of comparing synthetic spectra generated for each transition with column densities and temperatures of the cloud models .",
    "these spectra were convolved with the appropriate instrumental spread functions ( using ffts ) in order to directly compare with the observed spectra . for the hires and fos spectra",
    ", we use a gaussian with fwhm@xmath118   and @xmath119  , respectively .",

    "www.stsci.edu_.    for each iteration ,",
    "the synthetic spectra are superimposed on the observed spectra .",
    "a pixel by pixel @xmath120 was calculated as an indicator of the quality of the overall match . however , the value of @xmath120 was often dominated by large values in a very small fraction of `` bad '' pixels ( i.e.  those having correlated noise spikes or an interloping line blend ) .",
    "this rendered any objective @xmath121 minimization scheme fairly ineffective , since it yielded a very flat `` @xmath121 landscape '' .",
    "visual inspection , guided by @xmath121 minimization , was essential for comparing the full kinematic profile shapes in the synthetic spectra to the observational spectra .",
    "as described in appendix  a of @xcite , the ionization parameter was generally constrained by the relative strength of the metal  line transitions and the metallicity by , higher order lyman series lines , and lyman break from the fos spectrum .",
    "generally , this method yields both @xmath122 and @xmath123 constrained within @xmath124  dex ( for the assumed abundance pattern and kinematic parameterization of the profiles ) .",
    "we used the collisional ionization equilibrium models of @xcite .",

    "then , column densities of various species could be calculated using @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the column density of an arbitrary species .",
    "the doppler parameter of each ion could be obtained in the same way as for the photoionization model , with @xmath114 being the collisional temperature . in the case",
    "where the observed doppler parameter of the optimized species was consistent with @xmath131 , then @xmath132   was used for all ions .",
    "similar to the procedure for photoionization modeling , we generated synthetic model spectra and superimposed them upon the data for comparison .",
    "a main goal of our modeling is to parameterize the gas in as few ionization `` phases '' as possible . in practice ,",
    "the data require at least three phases .",
    "we define the term `` phase '' to denote the ionization conditions which predominantly ( or fully ) describe the density and ionization balance of the gas giving rise to absorption . for our models ,",

    "we `` optimized '' each cloud model on the column density for trial @xmath107 and @xmath113 .",

    "some systematic differences between milky way hvcs and those at @xmath287 are to be expected because the extragalactic background contribution has decreased substantially since @xmath287 @xcite .",
    "in particular , some milky way hvcs are detected only in low  ionization transitions , which could be explained by a stellar contribution to the ionizing spectrum .",
    "however , the `` satellite clouds '' around strong absorbers at @xmath287 and the hvcs around the milky way could really be the same population @xcite .    in conclusion , the physical conditions we inferred for system c could be consistent with it arising in the same type of structure that produces satellite absorption at smaller velocities around various strong absorbers .",
    "these conditions are not consistent with the properties of isolated , weak absorbers @xcite . in order",
    "that the probability of intercepting a high  velocity cloud at @xmath332   is not vanishingly small ( e.g. among the 22 high  velocity clouds in @xcite , the 2 with the highest velocity are at @xmath333  ) , there would have to be an abundant population of these objects in the pg  @xmath1 @xmath334 group , and their cross section would have to be large .",
