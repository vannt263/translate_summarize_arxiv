    "cooperative behavior of chaotic systems in interaction can lead to the emergence of partial and local synchronization @xcite .",
    "an interesting problem in this context is the stability of the synchronized state , which is ruled by the topology of the interaction @xcite . in most settings ,",
    "the coupling terms carry a finite time - delay due to the finite velocity of transmission of information . yet ,",
    "even for infinitely large time - delay the units can achieve zero - lag synchronization @xcite .",
    "the paradigmatic time - delayed coupled systems capable of chaos synchronization are semiconductor lasers @xcite , with interesting applications in secure communication @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon might have relevance as well in neuroscience @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of chaos synchronization can be gained by studying simple chaotic systems , such as bernoulli maps under single @xcite or multiple @xcite time - delays , for which the conditions for a stable synchronized state can be obtained analytically .",
    "these studies generally perform a stability analysis of the synchronized state on a fixed interaction network .",
    "additionally , a general formalism has been developed for ensembles of static random interaction networks @xcite .",
    "currently , there is an increasing interest in studying networks as time - varying entities @xcite .",
    "in fact , network fluctuations are essential features of some systems such as , for instance , interacting neurons , where synaptic plasticity continuously changes the topology @xcite .",
    "it is interesting then to inquire how does a fluctuating network affect synchronization stability @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a number of studies concerning synchronization on time - varying contact networks , where the topology changes due to the random motion of the agents , and the couplings are instantaneous .",
    "most of them consider diffusive coupling of moving oscillators @xcite , but also chaotic units @xcite . this problem has also been tackled for genetic oscillators moving on lattices @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the synchronization properties of chaotic maps interacting on random small - world directed networks whose topology fluctuates in time and whose links bear a large time - delay .",
    "there has been a very recent work concerning the case of coupled chaotic maps interacting with small time - delays comparable to the time scale of network switching .",
    "our work builds on the previous studies by exploring synchronization stability on the full range of possible scalings between the time - delay and the network switching time scale .",
    "we consider an interaction network of coupled chaotic maps with a single coupling delay , @xmath0 .",
    "the networks fluctuates with a characteristic time - scale @xmath1 .",
    "these network fluctuations are random , and not adaptive , i.e. , the network evolution is not linked to the state in any way .",
    "if @xmath2 , i.e. , the slow network regime , the dynamics always have enough time to adapt to the current network",
    ". therefore , if the network acquires a desynchronizing configuration , it will lose synchronization .",
    "re - synchronization , although possible in principle , is unlikely , for the chaotic maps that we consider .",
    "thus , we may regard the long term dynamics as desynchronized whenever the probability of reaching a non - synchronizing network is finite .",
    "the case where @xmath1 is comparable to @xmath0 or smaller is more involved .",
    "indeed , the system will spend time both in synchronizing and de - synchronizing networks .",
    "when the network reaches a de - synchronizing configuration , it will start to escape the synchronization manifold .",
    "but , if @xmath1 is not large enough , there is a probability of returning to a synchronizing configuration before a certain _ irreversibility line _ is crossed .",
    "thus , the system may stay synchronized . indeed , our results will prove stronger : when @xmath3 , in the fast fluctuations regime , synchronization becomes significantly more stable .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the fast switching approximation @xcite , which states that synchronization is possible for fast fluctuating networks and diffusive coupling if the time averaged graph laplacian synchronizes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system ] defines our time - delayed dynamical system , and reviews the basic framework for its study . in section [ sec : sw ] we study in detail the synchronizability in the case of ( static ) small - world networks .",
    "then , we define our fluctuating networks , the observables to be employed , and discuss the numerical results in detail in [ sec : fluctuating ] .",
    "the last section is devoted to the conclusions and further work .",
    "let us consider @xmath4 classical units , characterized by a single degree of freedom @xmath5 , @xmath6 and time @xmath7 , whose evolution is given by :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 $ ] is a real parameter which measures the strength of the interaction , @xmath0 is the coupling delay and @xmath10\\mapsto[0,1]$ ] is a chaotic map .",
    "we consider the the bernoulli map , modeled as    @xmath11    with @xmath12 , and the logistic map , given by    @xmath13    with @xmath14 . the network structure is described by the adjacency matrix @xmath15 . to ensure the _ existence _ of a synchronized dynamical state , the adjacency matrix is subject to a unit row - sum condition ( also known as stochasticity condition ) ,    @xmath16    for all @xmath17 and all times @xmath18 .",
    "nonetheless , this does not inform us about the stability of such synchronized state .    as a measure of the ( zero - lag ) synchronization in the network , we have chosen the logarithm of the spatial deviation over the network nodes .",
    "let us explain in detail the meaning of this observable .",
    "consider the spatial average of the unit states for a given time as    @xmath19    and the corresponding spatial standard deviation as    @xmath20    then , the _ synchronization level _ is defined as    @xmath21    a perfectly synchronized state would have @xmath22 , but in practice this value is bounded by the machine precision .",
    "in our calculations , using double precision floating point numbers , the maximal synchronization level corresponds approximately to @xmath23 , which implies a deviation of order @xmath24}\\sim 10^{-15}$ ] . on the other extreme , in a desynchronized state each unit behaves independently and @xmath25 .",
    "the minimal computed value of @xmath26 is close to @xmath27 , which is close to the mean deviation for a uniform distribution on @xmath28 $ ] : @xmath29 .",
    "we initialize the network close the synchronized state : all units evolve in unison for @xmath0 time steps , and we apply at @xmath30 a random point - like perturbation @xmath31 , with @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a vector of random numbers drawn uniformly from @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "thus , the synchronization level at @xmath30 is always around 25 , instead of the machine precision value of 35 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath34 the _ realization average _ over such initial conditions .",
    "our most relevant observable , therefore , will be @xmath35 .",
    "we define a _ synchronization lyapunov exponent _ ( sle ) as the average linear rate at which the synchronization level increases or decreases with time :    @xmath36    by this definition , @xmath37 is equivalent to the maximal lyapunov exponent transverse to the synchronization manifold , given by the master stability function @xcite , which approximates the evolution of a perturbation from the synchronized state @xmath38 .",
    "the stability of the synchronized state is related to the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath39 be the eigenvalues of @xmath15 sorted in descending order of their modulus , @xmath40 .",
    "gerschgorin circle theorem @xcite can be applied , showing that @xmath41 , and the unit row sum guarantees that @xmath42 , with eigenvector @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "hence , a perturbation along this mode preserves synchronization as it affects every unit equally .",
    "the evolution of a perturbation away from the synchronization manifold will then evolve according to the mode with second largest eigenvalue @xcite .    for a network of bernoulli maps ( eq . ) , assuming that @xmath44 and @xmath45 hold , the sle can be approximated by the following expression @xcite .",
    "@xmath46 hence , the condition for a stable synchronization manifold reads : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the _ spectral gap _ or _ eigengap_.    for other chaotic maps , the stretch factor of the map @xmath49 is not constant , and the sle is not analytically accessible .",
    "however , it has been shown that fluctuations in the term @xmath49 along the chaotic trajectory result in a larger spectrum of lyapunov exponents and thus in a smaller parameter region that sustains stable synchronization @xcite .",
    "we will study synchronization stability on fluctuating networks of coupled bernouilli maps in order to be able to compare with the analytical results for static networks .",
    "we will also study networks of logistic maps in order to assess the generality of our results .",
    "we have studied the stability of the synchronization manifold on statistical ensembles of small world networks , which constitute a standard benchmark for network synchronization @xcite . here , we will consider a family of newman - watts networks @xcite , similar to the standard small - world @xcite but keeping the outside ring fixed , so that it is guaranteed that the network is always connected .",
    "we will refer generically to these networks as small world ( sw ) .    to construct our networks",
    ", we consider a chiral 1d chain of @xmath4 sites , where the only non - zero entries have the form @xmath50 , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "then we add to the chiral backbone a number of @xmath51 of directed _ shortcuts _ , connecting random sites , with @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "an example of such a sw network , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sw ] ( top ) for illustration .    a first requirement for complete synchronization is given by the gcd condition , which states that the number of possible synchronized subnetworks is equal to the greatest common divisor ( gcd ) of the loop lengths of the network @xcite .",
    "hence , complete synchronization is only possible if the gcd of the lengths of all cycles in the network is unity .",
    "this is almost always the case for large enough networks with a finite number of shortcuts , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sw ] ( bottom ) .",
    "when the gcd condition is met , the stability of the synchronization manifold is still determined by the eigengap , as stated in eq . for the specific case of bernouilli maps .",
    "the adjacency matrices @xmath15 of directed networks are not hermitian , and their spectrum need not be real .",
    "let us discuss the statistical properties of their spectra , in similarity to the studies of @xcite .",
    "[ fig : sw_spectrum ] ( top ) shows the eigenvalues @xmath55 on the complex plane for two sw networks , using @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( left ) and @xmath58 ( right ) .",
    "notice that , following gerschgorin theorem , they are always contained within the unit circle .",
    "except for the @xmath59 eigenvalue , which is a consequence of the row - sum condition , the phases of the eigenvalues seem to be homogeneously distributed .",
    "moreover , they seem to be contained within a ring , whose radius we would like to characterize .    an interesting approach to estimate the properties of the spectrum of random matrices describing sw networks",
    "was developed in @xcite , using a mean - field approach : write down the _ average matrix _",
    ", whose entries are given by the average of the matrix entries .",
    "due to translation invariance , the resulting matrix is a _ circulant matrix _ , whose spectrum can be found analytically .",
    "we have followed this approach in order to find the mean field spectrum of our sw networks . in the appendix [ ap : mf ] we show that the spectrum of this average matrix lies in the vicinity of a circumference of radius    @xmath60    which appears marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : sw_spectrum ] ( top ) as _ mean - field _ line .",
    "however , the mean - field theory does not describe accurately the ring structure of the spectrum .",
    "we have found numerically that the outer circumference has an approximate radius of @xmath61 , independent of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , our estimate for the gap is    @xmath62    the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sw_spectrum ] shows the numerical evidence for expression , plotting the average spectral gap as a function of @xmath63 for different system sizes @xmath4 .",
    "interestingly , the inset shows that the standard deviation of the spectral gap among samples only grows like the square root of @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "once the spectral properties of our networks have been elucidated we can proceed to study their dynamics .",
    "we have simulated the dynamical system eq . and obtained numerically the synchronization lyapunov exponent ( sle ) for @xmath65 different sw networks with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , two values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and two maps : bernoulli , eq . , and logistic , eq . .",
    "we have chosen the numerical values of the parameters such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 so both maps have comparable lyapunov exponents when considered in isolation , .. the lyapunov exponent of the logistic map , @xmath73 , must be obtained computationally , but a value of @xmath72 gives @xmath74 @xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sw_sync ] ( top ) we plot the values of the sle against the spectral gap of each network . in the bernoulli case",
    "we find a tight relationship which follows approximately the theoretical expression for long delays eq . .",
    "the logistic case is more involved , but the negative correlation between both magnitudes is still clear .",
    "we can see that logistic systems synchronize better than bernouilli ones as they show a higher number of negative sle values .",
    "generally , networks with a larger spectral gap synchronize better . also , there is a higher probability of synchronization for higher @xmath63 values , since these networks present a larger eigengap .",
    "[ fig : sw_sync ] ( bottom ) shows the histogram of the sle for bernoulli and logistic systems , using always @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and two values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "we sample from the ensemble of all sw graphs with fixed @xmath4 and @xmath63 defined in section [ sec : sw ] .",
    "the sampled networks are then row - normalized such that the synchronized solution exists .",

    "unless otherwise stated , we will always choose @xmath67 for the time - delay .",
    "for @xmath89 , the synchronization level decays to its minimal value fast and full de - synchronization is irreversible . for @xmath90 ,",

    "the system synchronizes fully quite fast .",
    "let us average the synchronization level for a large number of realizations , @xmath92 .",
    "[ fig : average ] shows the results for three different systems of coupled bernoulli maps , showing only time steps which are multiples of @xmath67 .",
    "[ fig : average ] ( top ) shows the average synchronization for the same system as in fig .",
    "[ fig : show ] , in order to assess whether those results are generic .",
    "we see that for very short fluctuation time @xmath93 or @xmath94 , the average synchronization level remains close to its maximum value .",
    "hence the system synchronizes completely for all realizations independently of whether the instantaneous networks are synchronizing or not .",
    "this result for the fast fluctuation regime is quite general in all cases we considered and we discuss it on the next section . for @xmath95",
    "the synchronization level decays very slowly with time , and it decays much faster for @xmath91 . as we increase the fluctuation time , for @xmath96 , the synchronization decay is again a bit slower , and for @xmath90 or @xmath97 we can see that the system does not seem to desynchronize , but stays at a lower level of synchronization . for even slower fluctuations , @xmath98 ,",
    "the system desynchronizes again quite fast .",
    "we also remark the presence of oscillatory behavior for short times .",
    "[ fig : average ] ( center ) shows the case of a bernoulli system over sw networks with @xmath66 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , a parameter choice for which the average sle is negative .",
    "the main difference that we can observe is that for @xmath91 the system does not desynchronize , even though the asymptotic synchronization level is lower than for @xmath95 and @xmath90 .",
    "however , for @xmath101 the system still desynchronizes .",
    "the short time oscillations that we observed in the previous case are still present , but attenuated .",
    "one may ask how is it possible that , if the average sle is syncrhonizing , the system desynchronizes in the long run for slow network fluctuations .",
    "the reason is that , for bernoulli systems , desynchronization is _",
    "irreversible_. once a non - synchronizing network is sampled the system will start to desynchronize .",
    "if the system crosses a certain @xmath82 threshold the subsequently sampled synchronizing networks can not take the system back to synchronization .",
    "the lowest panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : average ] shows the average synchronization level for a logistic system on fluctuating sw networks with @xmath66 , @xmath83 and @xmath102 , a parameter choice for which the average sle is positive .",
    "the system synchronizes for fast network fluctuations @xmath84 , and for intermediate network times @xmath90 , but not when network fluctuation time and time - delay coincide .",
    "again , in the slow fluctuations regime , the synchronized state is unstable .",
    "finally , we report much stronger oscillations for this case than for bernouilli .",
    "we have found out that , with all other parameters fixed , there is always a critical value of @xmath103 , which we call @xmath104 such that , if @xmath105 the system stays synchronized almost surely , meaning that among the @xmath92 samples launched , all of them stayed synchronized up to time @xmath106 .",
    "[ fig : epscrit ] shows the critical @xmath104 for bernoulli systems as a function of the network fluctuation time , using fixed values for the other parameters , @xmath67 and @xmath83 .",
    "the three curves correspond to different system sizes @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "notice that , for @xmath66 and @xmath68 the transition curve presents a reentrant behavior : the critical curve is crossed three times ( see dashed horizontal line in fig . [",
    "fig : epscrit ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the peculiar behavior found in the synchronization level averages in fig .",
    "[ fig : average ] .    but fig .",
    "[ fig : epscrit ] ( top ) provides more information . in all cases",
    ", @xmath104 is minimal for small @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that synchronization is most likely to happen for fast network fluctuations .",
    "also , for very large @xmath1 the values of @xmath104 tend to one : synchronization becomes nearly impossible .",
    "for network fluctuation times @xmath110 we have an interesting increase in the value of @xmath104 , thus implying that when _ both time - scales collide , synchronizability is lower_. this phenomenon bears similarity to observations reported on neural network models with spike - timing dependent plasticity @xcite .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : epscrit ] shows the same average ( static ) sle as a function of @xmath103 and @xmath63 for a bernoulli system with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , marking also in white the zero sle line , i.e. : synchronization in average .",
    "the yellow , full - squares line marks the critical @xmath104 line of almost - sure synchronization for @xmath84 , which is below the average synchronization line for static networks .",
    "this means that even values of the parameters which do not yield synchronization in average , will still synchronize almost surely when subject to fast fluctuations .",
    "this enhancement of the synchronizability for rapidly fluctuating networks has been reported for a variety of systems with diffusive coupling @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the fast - switching approximation states that when the time - scale of the network fluctuations is much larger than the typical time - scale of the oscillator dynamics , the synchronization properties are well described by a mean - field network @xcite .",
    "this is not the case here : the pink dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : epscrit ] ( bottom ) delimits the mean - field synchronization region expected from the spectrum in eq . .",
    "as we can see , it differs from the yellow curve for fast network fluctuations , hence in our setting the mean - field curve does not provide a good approximation for the synchronization region of the fast switching regime .",
    "notice that our setting is different from the classic fast switching approximation framework , which was developed for diffusive coupling .",
    "instead , our couplings are given by the stochastic adjacency matrix and not by the laplacian .",
    "also , the interpretation of the internal time scale @xmath0 for time - delayed systems is not so simple as for the case of non - delayed oscillators .",
    "the weak chaos regime demands @xmath111 and the necessary time to reach synchronization is given by the sle , which scales inversely with @xmath0 .",
    "hence , for positive sle a larger internal time - scale implies faster decay to synchronization .",
    "nontheless , the behaviour is qualitatively similar to the fast switching approximation and the synchronizability is enhanced for @xmath112 .    finally , the green , open - squares line shows the @xmath104 line for @xmath89 .",
    "this corresponds to the static network regime @xmath113 .",
    "the synchronization region is much smaller : for slow fluctuations , it is very difficult to force the system to synchronize .",
    "a very salient feature of the average synchronization level curves in fig . [ fig : average ] is the presence of oscillations , which decay with time .",
    "the oscillations all show a periodicity related to the time - delay @xmath0 , and they have the same phase for different values of the network switching time @xmath1 .",
    "we illustrated this in further detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : osc ] ( top ) , which shows the average synchronization level for a short time - span for all time - steps ( not only multiples of 100 ) using different values of @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "these oscillations are independent of the network fluctuations , and they appear as well in fixed networks , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : osc ] ( bottom ) .    upon this primary oscillation",
    "we have found a secondary oscillation , which periodicity scales with the square of the time - delay , @xmath114 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : osc ] ( center ) we have removed the primary period , by showing only times multiple of @xmath0 , and we represent a longer time span , with the time axis rescaled to @xmath115 . again , these fluctuations have the same frequency and phase in all cases .",
    "these oscillations are related to our choice of initial condition : we perturb the system at @xmath30 , and this perturbation decays initially .",
    "the initial decay is a typical behavior for weakly chaotic systems @xcite . after a delay time the perturbation reappears , and this reappearance of a delay echo can be related to the observed periodicity equal to the delay time . for bernoulli maps",
    "the evolution can even be calculated explicitly , we included the analytic calculations in appendix [ ap : anal ] .",
    "this delay echo is transformed each time - delay interval and its shape gradually changes from an exponential decay to decaying oscillatory motion . in fig .",
    "[ fig : delayechos ] we show the analytically calculated evolution of a point - like perturbation along a specific direction in a fixed network of bernoulli elements . while the initial perturbation ( blue line ) decays exponentially , the consecutive delay echoes are broader , and reach their maximal amplitude at a later point in time within the delay interval .",
    "however , the exact mathematical origin of the observed secondary oscillations remains to be explained .    for general initial conditions in the vicinity of the synchronization manifold , one observes as well one or more frequency components related to the time - delay , and we conjecture that they are characteristic for delay systems .",
    "we expect however that the phase of the oscillations ( and thus the fact that they do not average out over multiple instances ) is a result of our choice of initial condition .      in order to explain the synchronization enhancement via network fluctuations we might conjecture that large gap networks pull the system towards the synchronization manifold , while low gap ones push it away .",
    "we have checked numerically that conjecture and found it to be inaccurate . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowgap ] we consider sw networks with @xmath66 and @xmath83 , on which we set up a bernoulli interacting system with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the difference is that the network fluctuations are only allowed to explore the ensemble of _ low gap _ graphs .",
    "specifically , we reject all sw networks whose gap is larger than @xmath116 .",
    "approximately , the probability of rejection with these parameters is @xmath58 .",

    "@xcite , where the alternation of losing strategies can give rise to a winning one .",
    "a random alternation of non - synchronizing networks can result strongly synchronizing .",
    "the possibility to enhance the stability of a system through fast oscillations or fluctuations is a topic of long tradition , e.g. the kapitza pendulum @xcite . in this work",
    "we have explored the effect of topology fluctuations on the synchronizability of small - world networks of time - delayed coupled chaotic maps .",

    "the spectral gap was found to be approximately given by @xmath119 independently of @xmath4 and it showed a clear relationship with the synchronization lyapunov exponent for networks of bernouilli and logistic maps .",
    "the bernouilli map case followed closely the theoretical prediction , while the mapping was more nonlinear for the logistc maps .",
    "we then studied how the synchronization properties are affected by a time varying coupling topology .",
    "we found the stability of the synchronized state to be strongly affected by the interplay between the time - scale of the delayed interactions , @xmath0 , and that of the network fluctuations , @xmath1 .",
