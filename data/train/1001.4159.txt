    "@xcite of nonspreading wave packets describing rydberg electrons driven by a circularly polarized wave was recently fully confirmed in experiments @xcite .",

    "the trojan states of atoms are deformed due to the action of the driving field . in this article",
    "we propose a simple model to study a possible existence of deformed states of multielectron atoms not subjected to external forces .",
    "the deformation is caused by the interaction of a rydberg electron with collectively described core electrons .",
    "the interaction of the rydberg electron with the core has been studied by clark and greene @xcite who described this interaction by a phenomenological coupling of the angular momentum of the electron to the angular momentum of the ion core .",
    "they were able to account successfully for subtle details of spectroscopic data but the deformation of the atoms has not been the subject of their interest . in our model",
    "we keep the pure coulombic coupling of the rydberg electron to the core but we describe the interaction of the core with nucleus by harmonic forces .",

    "_ @xcite have shown in the simplest case of the helium atom that due to the core polarizability deformed localized states can exist in isolated atoms .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the deformation was clearly identified in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we can find the following description : `` the oscillations of the inner charge generates a stabilizing field for the outer electron '' .",
    "the analysis presented in ref .",

    "we propose a simple model that captures the essential features of such special states of atoms . in our model one",
    "highly excited electron acting on _ all _ inner electrons creates a dipole moment and the induced dipole localizes the outer electron on its orbit .",
    "our aim is to give an intuitive picture of deformed atomic states that explains the nature of these states and could enable one to pinpoint their characteristics without the use of more elaborate methods .",
    "the purpose of the present article is , therefore , to show that the mechanism proposed in ref .",

    "the strong point of our analysis is that many steps can be performed analytically .",
    "there is an essential difference between our stable electronic states and the ones supported by an external field . since the dynamics of an _",
    "isolated atom _ is governed by a rotationally symmetric hamiltonian , the deformed states can only occur due to _ broken _ rotational symmetry .",
    "this mechanism is well known in nuclear physics where the breaking of rotational symmetry leads to deformed states of nuclei @xcite .",
    "the analogy between the deformed states of nuclei and possible deformed states of atoms was pointed out by iwai @xcite .",
    "to describe intricate dynamics that leads to a deformed atom , we introduce a greatly simplified model of a multielectron atom . within this model",
    "we can identify atomic states in which the repulsion between one excited electron and the core causes the deformation .",
    "this lonely electron will be described as usual but the remaining core electrons occupying orbits close to the nucleus will be replaced by a _ single effective particle _ endowed with the mass and the charge of all the core electrons .",
    "the interaction of this effective particle with the far away electron will be kept coulombic while the interaction with nucleus will be modeled by a harmonic force with a spring constant reflecting the polarizability of the core .",
    "the description of the strongly bound electrons in terms of a harmonic force and the corresponding oscillator strength parameters has been successfully used in the early days of quantum mechanics . here",
    "we push this description further by applying the combined oscillator model to all core electrons .",
    "our model can not give a precise description of the deformed atom but owing to its simplicity gives a clear picture of the mechanism that is responsible for the symmetry breaking and for the stability of deformed states .",
    "the hamiltonian in our model of the atom has the following form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 .",
    "the first part of this hamiltonian describes the kinetic energies of the nucleus and the singled out electron , and also their mutual coulomb interaction .",

    "this state has a higher quasienergy ( @xmath146 . the superposition with the minus sign leads to the localization of the electron on the opposite side of the nucleus .",
    "therefore , it corresponds to the lower quasienergy .",
    "this quantum state , together with gaussian state of the core @xmath147 , is a counterpart of classical localized orbits of the electron and the core  it gives a quantum description of a deformed atom .",
    "to illustrate these phenomena we choose the following superpositions , including their time - dependent phase factors    [ 56 ] @xmath148 and [ fig10 ] .",
    "we see that the localization weakens with the increase of the principal quantum number .",
    "this was to be expected since a larger @xmath138 means a weaker interaction with the core .    in what follows",
    ", we shall focus on the state @xmath149 .",
    "the matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ deg ] ) for @xmath115 is equal to @xmath150 .",
    "according to ( [ res1 ] ) , in this case the value of @xmath151 is @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , the quasienergy for this state is decreased by @xmath154 .",
    "it is instructive to transform the stationary state in the rotating frame to the ( inertial ) laboratory frame .",
    "this transformation is accomplished simply by multiplying every eigenstate of @xmath86 belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath155 by the phase factor @xmath156 .",
    "this means that the state vector ( [ 54 ] ) transforms into @xmath157 the electron probability density in this state is given by the formula : @xmath158 where we denoted by @xmath159 the hydrogenic wave function without the phase factors @xmath160 and we have taken into account the fact that these functions for the maximal values of @xmath136 and @xmath137 are real .",
    "thus , as expected , the superposition ( [ 54 ] ) transformed to the laboratory frame describes an electron wave packet revolving around the nucleus with the frequency ( [ res1 ] ) .",
    "the quantum state @xmath149 of the deformed atom has only two decay channels with the emission of dipole radiation .",
    "the selection rules and the quasienergy conservation allow the transitions to the states @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "in the first case , the radiated photon has the quasienergy @xmath163 and it is linearly polarized along the @xmath97 direction .",
    "the dipole matrix element @xmath164 is equal to @xmath165 . in the second case , the quasienergy of the photon is @xmath166 and the radiated photon is emitted with circular polarization .",
    "the dipole matrix element @xmath167 is equal to @xmath168 .",
    "these results must be now transformed to the laboratory frame .",
    "deformed states of the atom offer a unique opportunity to study the effects of the rotational frequency shift predicted some time ago @xcite .",
    "these effects up to now have been seen only in molecules @xcite .",
    "rotational frequency shift is an analog of the doppler shift . to account for the doppler shift ,",
    "when comparing the energies of a photon with momentum @xmath169 measured in two reference frames moving with respect to each other with velocity @xmath170 , one has to add the scalar product @xmath171 . to account for the rotational frequency shift , when comparing the energies of a photon with angular momentum @xmath172 measured in two reference frames rotating with respect to each other with the angular velocity @xmath12 , one has to add the scalar product @xmath173 of the angular velocity and photon angular momentum .",
    "the rotational frequency shift does not lead to any observable phenomena for a state that is rotationally symmetric since there is no way of telling whether a quantum system in such a state is rotating or not .",
    "the transformation to the laboratory frame does not affect the transition matrix elements but the energy of the emitted photons acquires an additional term @xmath174 .",
    "thus , the spontaneous decay of our state @xmath149 leads to the emission of a linearly polarized photon with the energy @xmath175 or a circularly polarized photon with the energy @xmath176 .",
    "the transition rates are practically the same as for standard rydberg states with maximal values of @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "with the use of a simple model of an isolated multielectron atom we predicted the existence of stable states describing a deformed atom . in such states",
    ", one excited electron is localized as a wave packet on a circular rydberg orbit .",
    "the core made of the remaining electrons is polarized due to the interaction between the electron and the core .",
    "the deformation requires breaking of the rotational symmetry .",
    "in classical theory , we were able to give exact description of the atomic deformation and we proved the linear stability of deformed states .",
    "in quantum theory , we had to resort to a perturbative treatment of the interaction between the core and the electron .",
    "localized states of the excited electron are special superpositions of two circular rydberg states . in the construction of such stable localized states ,",
    "the essential role was played by the phenomenon of level crossing in the frame rotating with the electron .",
    "we can not give a prescription on how to produce the special superpositions describing a localized electron .",
    "however , the calculated redshifts in spontaneous decays of those states could be used as their signature .",
    "unfortunately , our model is so crude that its predictions can not be precise but we hope that they are of the right order of magnitude .      2 i. bialynicki - birula , m. kalinski , and j. h. eberly , phys .",
