    "fewer lattice simulations have been performed for the mass differences between spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 baryons containing one or more heavy quarks@xcite .",
    "it is useful to compare these baryon mass differences to the meson mass differences mentioned above , since both are colour hyperfine ( spin - spin ) effects .",
    "quantitative relationships between the meson and baryon splittings have been claimed using experimental data , quark models or heavy quark effective theory .",
    "if these relations are respected by lattice qcd simulations then the baryon spin splittings will be smaller than experiment ( just like mesons ) , but if lattice results for the baryons agree with experiment then the relations must clearly be violated .",
    "in either case , the information will be helpful when seeking to understand the existing discrepancy between lattice qcd simulations and experiment .",
    "a simple quark model for the hadron masses uses the operators @xmath0 it follows that the spin splittings for heavy - light mesons and for singly and doubly heavy baryons vanish like @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 contain wave function information .",
    "the determination of @xmath5 , using a relation between the wave function at the origin and the derivative of the potential ( plus some other postulates ) , has been discussed by lipkin@xcite and by lipkin and odonnell@xcite .",
