    "recent calculations on the plasma excitations of a spherical two - dimensional electron gas ( s2deg ) have yielded some interesting behaviors as functions of the angular momentum quantum number @xmath0 and the radius @xmath3 of the shell @xcite . in those model calculations ,",
    "the electron gas is assumed to be confined to an infinitesimally thin shell which is embedded in a medium with background dielectric constant @xmath4 .",
    "the plasma excitation frequencies were shown not to depend on the projection @xmath1 of angular momentum @xmath0 on the axis of quantization .",
    "this degeneracy is expected due to retained rotational symmetry and there is no energy dispersion which arises in the case for the cylindrical nanotube@xcite .",
    "interest in plasmon excitations in fullerenes dates back to the work by stling , et al.@xcite who used a spherical shell model to examine the experimental data for plasma resonances in c@xmath5@xcite.the model for the plasmons described in ref .",
    "[ ] assumes that the buckyball is doped and its active modes are attributed to either dipole or monopole - like excitations . since our system is neutral , only dipole - like plasmon modes will exist .",
    "the interest in the s2deg has been generated by the observation that fullerenes@xcite span an entire family from  buckybabies  with thirty - two carbon atoms and radius @xmath6 nm to very large fullerenes with four thousand , eight hundred and sixty atoms and radius @xmath7nm@xcite .",
    "these molecules can be modified into other molecular configurations which make them very versatile .",
    "it is such an adaptability that gives them enormous practical applications in materials science , electronics and nanotechnology .",
    "the model we employ , which consists of a s2deg confined to the surface , allows us to investigate the electronic properties , related to their spherical shape and the lattice structure@xcite , and to neglect their radial motion@xcite at the same time .",
    "these electronic properties include the collective plasma excitations , electron energy loss spectra as well as the thermoelectric properties of fullerenes .",
    "this is conceptually similar to the electron gas model for a carbon nanotube , which has been studied extensively@xcite .",
    "the only variables in our calculations are the radius , the separation between two displayed shells and the number of free electrons on each shell .",
    "the plasma formula contains these parameters , as well as the orbital angular momentum , and we vary them to examine how the plasmon frequency depends on them .    the authors of ref . [ ] attempted to obtain the plasma excitations for a pair of displaced s2degs whose centers do not coincide .",
    "however , the formalism by rotkin and suris@xcite is incomplete since these authors did not include the full coulomb coupling between the two s2degs in their eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "consequently , the eq.(8 ) in their paper for plasma excitations has missed the coulomb matrix elements coupling all the possible angular momenta on the two spheres , meaning that we can not use the angular momentum to label plasma excitations , or @xmath0 is no longer a good quantum number for the system considered , as they have done in their eq.(9 ) .",
    "another interesting subtlety which arises from the coulomb dimer is worth commenting on at this point .",
    "suppose we chose the axis of quantization for angular momentum to be along the @xmath8 direction .",
    "let us assume that one of the s2degs has its center at the origin as shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "we then have a choice of placing the second s2deg with its center on the @xmath8-axis or on the @xmath9-axis . from a mathematical point of view , the coulomb matrix elements involved have values which depend on the spatial coordinates . from a physical point of view , once the axis of quantization is chosen , the spherical symmetry in the coulomb dimer is broken , resulting in a dependence of location for the second s2deg .",
    "similar calculations of the polarization functions proved the existence of strongly localized image states near the surface of a buckyball @xcite .     and outer radius @xmath10 . here , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are angular momentum quantum number and component for spheres.,scaledwidth=20.0% ]     direction with angular momentum quantum number @xmath0 and component @xmath1 . in ( a )",

    "these may model either a double shell onion - type buckyball as illustrated in fig.[fig:1 + ] or a pair of non - overlapping buckyballs",
    "whose centers have a finite separation between them ( called coulomb dimer ) , as depicted in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "each s2deg may be polarized by external electromagnetic fields . however , the s2deg is only polarized for finite angular momentum quantum number @xmath11 . additionally , @xmath0 is still a good quantum number for labeling the plasma excitations on concentric shells . here",
    ", for simplicity , @xmath12 corresponds to a non - circularly - polarized probe field , while @xmath13 is associated with a circularly - polarized probe field .",
    "moreover , the higher angular momentum with @xmath14 can be achieved by a special light beam , e.g. , a helical light beam .",
    "however , when two s2degs have their centers well separated so that there is no overlap of their charge distributions , the breaking of the spherical symmetry leads to significant differences with the double - wall buckyball , as we now describe .",
    "when the two shells are concentric , the coulomb interaction between them enters the plasmon mode equation through its dependence on the angular momentum quantum number @xmath0 as well as the radius of each shell .",
    "this type of coulomb coupling only leads to a renormalization of each of the two plasmon modes which exist on each shell independent of the s2deg on the other .",
    "the resulting coupled modes are in - phase symmetric and out - of - phase antisymmetric charge - density oscillations .",
    "however , as far as the coulomb dimer is considered , the polarization functions for all values of @xmath0 on each sphere are coupled to each other .",
    "the inter - sphere coulomb matrix element depends on both @xmath0 and its projection @xmath1 on the axis of quantization .",
    "therefore , in principle , the plasmon mode equation is given in terms of a determinant of infinite dimension .",
    "but , the corresponding matrix may be divided into diagonal sub - matrices corresponding to @xmath15 and consisting of @xmath16 elements whose coulomb interactions depend on @xmath0 and @xmath17 values of @xmath1 for each of the two shells .",
    "the off - diagonal sub - matrices , on the other hand , involve coulomb matrix elements which depend on pairs of different angular momenta , @xmath0 and @xmath18 , arising from each sphere .",
    "these off - diagonal coulomb terms are generally smaller than their diagonal counterparts and so may be formally treated as perturbations .",
    "consequently , in the lowest - order approximation , the @xmath13 mode is split by coulomb interactions depending on @xmath19 on each sphere , leading to the occurrence of three symmetric and three antisymmetric plasmon modes .",
    "additionally , we derive semi - analytic expressions for these coulomb matrix elements for large separations . the coulomb interaction described by the diagonal sub - matrices",
    "directly lead to the spatial correlation between plasmons on two spheres ( or simply called the coulomb dimerization for short ) .    in sec.[sec2 ]",
    ", we will first formulate the method for calculating the plasmon equations on a pair of non - overlapping s2degs .",
    "this is based on the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) in evaluating the induced density fluctuations for a weak external perturbation .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] is devoted to a discussion of our numerical results .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in sec.[sec4 ] .",
    "mathematical details of our calculations are provided in appendices .",
    "we first use linear - response theory to derive the plasma mode equation for a s2deg on a pair of concentric shells with inner radius @xmath20 and outer radius @xmath10 .",

    ", the plasmon frequency for the 2deg has a @xmath122 dependence which resembles the variation of frequency with @xmath0 in fig.[fig:2](a ) at small angular momentum . at large angular momentum ,",
    "on the other hand , the plasmons are severely damped by the particle - hole modes analogous to the landau damping of plasmon excitations in a 2deg when @xmath121 is comparable with the fermi wave vector @xmath123 .",

    "the corresponding region of high plasmon intensity lies close to the upper boundary of single - particle excitations , as seen from fig.[fig:2](a ) .",
    "of course , these boundaries for electron - hole modes are determined by the chemical potential of the s2deg , i.e. , the number of electrons , as well as the electron effective mass . on the other hand",

    "since the structure is spherically symmetric , the plasma modes can still be labeled by the angular momentum quantum number @xmath0 .",

    "the two plasmon branches correspond to in - phase ( symmetric ) and out - of - phase ( anti - symmetric ) charge - density oscillations .",
    "when the difference between the radii is small in ( a ) , single - particle energies from the two shells almost coincide and the symmetric and anti - symmetric plasmons lie close to each other and are well above the regions where there exists landau damping as shown in fig.[fig:2+](a ) .",
    "this behavior is connected to a very weak inter - shell coulomb interaction which is scaled by @xmath144 for @xmath145 . as the radius of the outer s2deg is increased , one of the plasmon frequencies is pushed down .",
    "such an observation can be attributed to the strongly enhanced inter - shell coulomb interaction with @xmath146 as @xmath147 .",

    "each of these modes has different intensity arising from the value of the loss function . by including the matrix elements which involve the @xmath154 angular momentum",
    ", there will be additional plasmon modes , which will not affect these six lowest modest substantially if the two shells are not too close to each other ( see fig.[fig:7 ] ) .",
    "these results in conjunction with those in figs.[fig:5](b ) and [ fig:5 + ] clearly demonstrate the existence of plasmon - coupling based dimerization , as well as its significance , in this system .     for plasmon excitations when @xmath13 for a pair of s2degs each of radius @xmath182 nm .",
    "one sphere is at the origin and the other is centered on the @xmath9-axis .",
    "the inset shows how the plasmon excitations merge to form a single branch as @xmath163 . here , we have fixed @xmath120.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    finally , we investigated in fig.[fig:6 ] the dependence of plasma frequency on separation @xmath151 between two s2degs with their centers on the @xmath9-axis .",
    "as expected , the split plasmon branches merge into a single branch for sufficiently large separations , as depicted in the inset of fig.[fig:6 ] . as we mentioned above",
    ", the multiplicity of plasmon modes could be less than six distinct solutions which is determined by the strengths of the inter - sphere coulomb matrix elements .",
    "the calculated @xmath160 dependence of the inter - sphere coulomb interaction directly verifies the magnetic - field coupling mechanism for @xmath161 in the dimerization process .",
    "in this paper , we presented a formalism for calculating plasma excitations for a pair of coulomb coupled spherical electron gases .",
    "the rpa was used in this investigation .",
    "the s2deg is a first - order approximation for calculating electronic properties of fullerenes when the lattice structure , band width from electron hopping and radial motion may be neglected .",
    "however , we may incorporate a more realistic energy band structure into the polarization function through a form factor by making use of the results presented in ref .",
    "[ ] . this would also account for the prescribed number of electrons on the fullerene .",
    "the plasmon excitation formula for a pair of coulomb coupled s2degs is different when the shells are concentric compared to when these shells are side - by - side .",
    "for one thing , the angular momentum is a good quantum number for concentric shells , but all angular momenta on two displaced shells are coupled . in the latter case , we calculated the plasmon modes approximately to lowest order by including only the dominant coulomb matrix elements which were obtained analytically . additionally , we have demonstrated that the frequency of plasmon excitation for a pair of displaced and coulomb coupled s2degs depends on both the separation between their centers as well as whether their centers lie along the axis of quantization or not .",
    "this is a consequence of the functional dependence of the coulomb matrix elements on spatial orientation .",
    "we note that spectral correlations have been observed experimentally for metallic nanoparticles @xcite in that work , the plasmons for pairs were studied using polarization - selective total internal reflection .",
    "their measurements show that the frequencies for the coupled plasmon modes depend on whether the incident light wave vector perpendicular and parallel to the dimer axis .",
    "related work on dimer plasmons has been conducted by nordlander , et al .",
    "( ref . [ ] ) with the conclusion that the hybridized plasmon energy arising from individual metallic nanoparticles is determined by the orientation of the inter - particle axis with respect to the axis of polarization of the two constituents modeled as incompressible spherical liquids .",
    "although our model differs from that in ref .",
    "[ ] the conclusions about the existence of anisotropy in the plasmon excitation energies in these systems are in agreement .",
    "similar effects are also expected to be observed in the case of nano - eggs : non - concentric multishells of nanoparticles .",
    "the hybridization of the plasmons has been proven to be an adequate and precise method to describe the plasmonic structure @xcite .",
    "the field enhancement , corresponding to the resonant excitation of plasmons , was reported to be much larger in the case of concentric nanoparticles , which support indirectly the concept of plasmon spatial correlation .",
    "generally , the angular momentum of light may be carried by either orbital motion ( helicity ) or spin motion ( circular polarization ) .",
    "when the incident light has zero angular momentum with @xmath12 , the electric field generated from the induced isotropic electric dipole moment for the @xmath158 electron state on one sphere may couple to an induced electric dipole moment for other @xmath158 electron states on another displaced sphere .",
    "however , such an isotropic plasmon excitation is associated with a change of the radial quantum number , and is prohibited in our model for spherical shells of electron gases .",
    "if a finite angular momentum of light with @xmath13 is used for incidence , on the other hand , the magnetic field generated from the induced oscillating electric dipole moment on one sphere can couple to the induced magnetic dipole moment on another displaced sphere .",
    "this unique inter - sphere magnetic ( plasmon ) coupling , which is associated with the magnetic dipole moment for @xmath159 , becomes anisotropic in space , depending on the displacement of two spheres parallel or perpendicular to the direction of a probe electric field .",
    "in addition , such an oscillating electric dipole moment based inter - sphere magnetic coupling directly leads to dimerization of electron gases on two spheres . for the plasmon excitation with @xmath183 , the higher angular - momentum component of specific incident light beam",
    "is required , such as a helical or a bessel light beam . in principle",
    ", the effect of plasmon coupling predicted in this paper should be experimentally observable by using light with a finite angular momentum for incidence and rotating the sample by @xmath184 for showing its directional bonding effect .",
    "the key feature presented in this paper is the broken rotational symmetry by coupling between two center - displaced s2degs based on photo - excited electron density fluctuations . here",
    ", the quantization axis of the system is selected by the probe electric field .",
    "such a directional plasmon - correlation effect will be lost if two s2degs are projected onto a plane , i.e. , a pair of quantum rings@xcite , because the quantization axis is always perpendicular to the plane of the rings . for a s2deg",
    ", we obtain a degeneracy in single - electron kinetic energies with respect to @xmath185 ( angular momentum number along the axis of quantization ) .",
    "but , this degeneracy is reduced to @xmath186 for a quantum ring . in order to completely remove the @xmath185-degeneracy ,",
    "an external magnetic field @xmath187 can be applied to the system . in this case , a strong magnetic field will change the s2deg simply to a landau quantized s2deg@xcite with kinetic energy @xmath188 but change a quantum ring to a classical point mass rotating around a circle with reduced inertia and angular velocity @xmath189 , where @xmath190 .",
