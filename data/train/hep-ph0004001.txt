    "the search for supersymmetric particles has become a standard item for on - going as well as future experiments at high energy colliders .",
    "no signal has as yet been found , and the absence of evidence has been translated to lower limits on the masses of various sparticles  @xcite . since the qualitative features as well as",
    "the size of experimental signals are determined by sparticle production cross sections and decay patterns , any such interpretation can strictly speaking only be done within the framework of a particular model , most often taken to be the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model . while it is true that in some cases the non - observation of a signal can be translated into a sparticle mass bound in a relatively model - independent manner ; even here it is tacitly assumed that the decay of @xmath4 is prompt . ] , the extraction of signals ( or bounds ) becomes increasingly complicated if several sparticles are expected to be simultaneously produced as , for instance , at hadron colliders such as the cern lhc",
    ". this may be due to significant differences of sparticle mass and decay patterns from the msugra expectations  @xcite , or due to new decay modes being accessible as in gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) models  @xcite with a low susy breaking scale , so that the gravitino is by far the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .    in recent years",
    ", there has been a flurry  @xcite of theoretical as well as experimental activity  @xcite on the detection of susy signals within the gmsb framework , where susy breaking is communicated from the hidden sector to the observable sector via standard model ( sm ) gauge interactions of messenger particles ( which , we assume , can be classified into @xmath5 complete vector representations of @xmath6 ) with quantum numbers of @xmath7 doublets of quarks and leptons whose mass scale is characterized by @xmath8 .",
    "the soft supersymmetry breaking masses for the susy partners of sm particles are thus proportional to the strength of their gauge interactions , so that squarks are heavier than sleptons , while the gaugino masses satisfy the usual `` grand unification '' mass relations , though for very different reasons . within the minimal version of this framework , the couplings and masses of the sparticles in the observable sector are determined ( at the messenger scale @xmath8 ) by the parameter set , @xmath9 the parameter @xmath10 sets the scale of sparticle masses and is the most important of these parameters . the model predictions for soft - susy breaking parameters at the scale @xmath8",
    "are evolved to the weak scale .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 @xcite and enters only into the partial width for sparticle decays to gravitino .",
    "the decay to a gravitino is phenomenologically important only for the decay of the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) .",
    "we fix @xmath12 which corresponds to the fastest possible decay of the nlsp into the gravitino : for larger values of @xmath13 , the nlsp may decay with an observable decay gap ( possibly improving the sensitivity to the signal ) , or may even pass all the way through the detector",
    ".    the phenomenological implications of the model are only weakly sensitive to @xmath8 . aside from the scale of sparticle masses ,",
    "the single item that most sensitively determines sparticle signals at colliders is the identity of the nlsp . in the simplest version of model ,",
    "the nlsp is either the lightest neutralino ( @xmath14 ) with the hypercharge gaugino as its dominant component , or the lighter stau ( @xmath15 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "depending on the value of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 may be essentially degenerate with @xmath15 .",
    "if the nlsp is a @xmath19 gaugino - like neutralino , it dominantly decays via @xmath20 , and susy events always contain two hard , isolated photons and @xmath0 ( from the escaping gravitinos ) in addition to jets and/or leptons . in the case where the nlsp is a stau which is significantly lighter than other sleptons ,",
    "it is produced in most susy decay chains , and susy events in this scenario typically contain several tau leptons .",
    "other light sleptons decay via @xmath21 if the decay is allowed ; otherwise as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , these mostly decay via @xmath22 or @xmath23 which ( even for @xmath12 ) , as long as these are not kinematically strongly suppressed , have a much larger branching ratio than for the decay @xmath24 . for the case",
    "where @xmath25 ( the co - nlsp scenario ) , only the gravitino mode is allowed , so that we may then expect a significant multiplicity of isolated @xmath26 s and @xmath27 s in susy events .    in a previous paper @xcite , we examined susy signals and the reach of the fermilab tevatron main injector ( for integrated luminosities of 2 and 25  @xmath3 ) for representative cases for each one of these three model lines discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "we also examined the reach for the so - called higgsino model line   where the nlsp is a higgsino - like neutralino .",
    "although this does not occur in the minimal version of the gmsb framework because @xmath27 tends to be large compared to the hypercharge gaugino mass @xmath28 , we were motivated to examine this case since experimental signals tend to be quite different because the nlsp dominantly decays via @xmath29 ( rather than @xmath20 ) unless this decay is suppressed by phase space .",
    "our purpose here is to perform a similar study for the reach of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , a @xmath30 collider with a center of mass energy @xmath31  tev , currently scheduled to begin operation in 2005 .",
    "we assume throughout this paper that an integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath32 is collected , which corresponds to a year of running at the lower value of the design luminosity .",
    "toward this end we examine the susy reach of the lhc for ,    * model line a : @xmath33 , @xmath34  tev , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , which gives a @xmath19 gaugino - like nlsp ; * model line b : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath36 , for which the nlsp is a stau ; * model line c : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , which yields the co - nlsp scenario ; * model line d : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath42 , @xmath44 , which gives a higgsino - like neutralino as the nlsp , which if heavy enough mainly decays via @xmath45 ; * model line e : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath42 , @xmath46 , which also gives a higgsino - like neutralino as the nlsp , but which mainly decays via @xmath47 as long as the decay is not suppressed by phase space .",
    "since we have already examined the lhc reach for model line a before  @xcite , we will confine our attention to model lines b - e in this paper .",
    "the tevatron reach for model lines b , c and d was studied in ref .",
    "the reach for a gaugino - like nlsp model line , but with a slightly different set of parameters ( which should have no qualitative effect on the results ) was also examined in this same study .",
    "model line e is new .",
    "the difference between d and e is that while @xmath14 mainly decays via @xmath48 for model line d , the decay @xmath47 dominates  @xcite in the case of model line e ( assuming , of course , that these decays are kinematically unsuppressed ) .    for each of the model lines b - e , we first examine the reach using the strategy  @xcite for susy searches within the msugra framework : _ i.e. _ the reach via the @xmath0 plus @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 inclusive channels .",
    "we expect that this ( or something like it ) will be the canonical strategy  @xcite for susy searches in the initial data samples from the lhc . for each of these model lines",

    "we see that even with this minimal requirement , the cross section for @xmath157 events is just 3.25 ( .92 )  @xmath158 for @xmath159  tev . since these channels all suffer from physics , and more importantly instrumental , backgrounds from sm sources , we conclude that tagging hadronically decaying taus is unlikely to improve the reach for this model line : cuts to remove these will reduce the signal to below the observable level for @xmath10 values where the canonical strategy does not lead to a detectable signal .",
    "we also attempted to extract the signal via `` clean '' multilepton plus multi - tau channels where we veto events with jets that are not identified as taus .",
    "we found that typically the signal reduces by an order of magnitude ( or more , depending on the transverse momentum threshold for the jet veto ) and falls well below the one event level in all the channels .",

    "we have also examined the @xmath266 tagged @xmath71-jet channel which without the hardness cut 3 has a much better @xmath267 ratio .",

    "it is conceivable though that with an integrated luminosity of 100  @xmath3 this channel may prove more promising ; the background from @xmath268 production would then have to be carefully examined .",
    "finally , we examine whether it is possible to identify the higgs boson , which is the characteristic feature of model line d , in susy events .",
    "it has been known for many years that the presence of higgs bosons can be inferred either via the multiplicity of @xmath71-jets in susy events @xcite , or more directly , via the reconstruction of a mass bump in the @xmath269 distribution  @xcite .",
    "we follow the latter approach , and attempt to reconstruct the lighter higgs boson ( which has a mass of about 104  gev ) in susy events in channels with identified @xmath71-jets for @xmath270  tev and @xmath271  tev . again",
    "top quark pair production is the major sm background . to reduce this , we require that @xmath272 where the sum extends over untagged @xmath71-jets with @xmath273  gev .",

    "we found that we were unable to obtain a mass bump ( with these as well as several other selection cuts that we examined ) even though the cross section was quite large .",
    "we traced this to the fact that most of the time one of the two @xmath71-jets from @xmath252 decay usually has @xmath278  gev , and so fails our tagging criteria .",
    "in other words , the two @xmath71-jets from the decay of @xmath252 are almost never simultaneously tagged . to enable the identification of @xmath252 in susy events , we include in our analysis that @xmath71-jets with @xmath66 between 25 and 50  gev may also be tagged , but with a reduced efficiency which we take to be  @xcite @xmath279 .",
    "we extrapolate our previous mistagging rate down to 25  gev .    the @xmath269 distribution in the two and three tagged @xmath71 channels after the cuts above is shown in fig .  [ mbb_mld ] for @xmath276 and 110  tev .",
    "the dashed histograms are the @xmath141 background while the solid histograms are the sum of the signal and background .",
    "we see that there is a clear peak close to @xmath228 in the @xmath269 distributions in the two tagged @xmath71 channel .",
    "the distribution cuts off at the low end because each tagged jet has at least 25  gev , while the continuum beyond the peak corresponds to combinations where one or both @xmath71-jets come from sources other than higgs decay or are qcd jets that have been mistagged . the corresponding peaks for the three @xmath71 channel , though present , is not as distinctive , presumably because the combinatorial background also contributes to the continuum .",
    "we also examined the distribution of @xmath59 of the higgs boson reconstructed from two tagged @xmath71s with @xmath280 ; _ i.e. _ in the peak .",
    "we might expect that this distribution would scale with @xmath281 , and hence provide a measure of @xmath10 .",
    "we found , however , that the distributions for @xmath10 in the 80 - 110  tev range overlapped quite substantially , and conclude that it is difficult to measure @xmath10 this way .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that the change in @xmath281 is rather limited ( 160 - 220  gev ) , and further , that @xmath252 can also be produced at an earlier stage in the cascade , thereby smearing this distribution . for larger values of @xmath10",
    "the event rate appears to be too low for this to be feasible .",
    "if the nlsp contains a significant fraction of the susy partner of the would - be neutral goldstone boson ( that becomes the longitudinal component of the @xmath140 by the higgs mechanism ) , it would preferentially decay via @xmath47 provided that this decay is not kinematically suppressed .",

    "the big difference is that the branching fraction for @xmath253 which was 26% per lepton flavour for model line d is now about 19% , while there is a corresponding increase in @xmath286 decay .",
    "since the presence of @xmath250 in a cascade decay chain frequently results in two leptons ( see the corresponding discussion for model line d ) , it is not surprising that the inclusive trilepton signal is reduced relative to model line d. indeed we have checked that for @xmath287  gev , this signal , although it has a large statistical significance , falls below the five event level ( for @xmath288  tev ) , so that we are forced to lower @xmath124 to 100  gev for which the sm background  @xcite is much larger .",

    "since the @xmath140 can be identified via its leptonic decay , we focus on events with an identified @xmath140 together with either two jets with @xmath290  gev or additional leptons . to further suppress backgrounds , we found it was necessary to require a large @xmath0 in these events .",

    "we expect though that the dominant background could well come from instrumental effects when a jet or lepton is misidentified as a photon .",

    "although not in themselves a `` proof '' , it is precisely such studies that have led to the general belief that the lhc will be the definitive machine that will test susy . in this study",
    ", we have added to this evidence by examining the susy reach of the lhc within the gmsb framework with susy broken at a scale of a few hundred tev . in this case , the gravitino is then the lsp and susy signatures are governed by the nature of the nlsp which then decays into the gravitino and sm particle(s ) . in our analysis",
    ", we conservatively assume that the nlsp decay is prompt , and do not attempt to use the possible presence of a displaced vertex to enhance the susy signal .",
    "we divide our study along various model lines introduced in section  i. for each of these model lines , the nlsp ( which is almost always produced as the penultimate product of the sparticle decay cascade ) decays via characteristic modes , which can then be used to enhance the susy signal , or even to narrow down the model parameters .",
    "we do not attempt the latter in the present study . for model line a which was studied in ref .",

    "we have examined the lhc reach for four other model lines corresponding to ( b ) the stau nlsp scenario , ( c ) the co - nlsp scenario where all three flavours of light charged sleptons are essentially degenerate , and two higgsino - like nlsp scenarios where nlsp decays to ( d ) the light higgs boson and ( e ) the @xmath140 boson , dominate . the usual strategy for susy searches via @xmath0 and multilepton events will probe gluino masses up to about 2  tev , except in the co - nlsp model line where the fact that selectrons and smuons are produced in many cascade decay chains leads to a plethora of @xmath0 events with @xmath313 isolated leptons ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) which have very small sm backgrounds . in this case",
    "the reach of the lhc extends to @xmath314  tev ! for model lines b and d , however , we found that whereas the decays of the nlsp may result in events that are characteristic of the particular model line , signals with identified @xmath149 leptons or tagged @xmath71 jets do not , in general , extend the susy reach beyond what is obtained via standard multilepton analyses . for model line e ,",

    "<S> we examine signals for sparticle production at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) within the framework of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models with a low susy breaking scale for four different model lines , each of which leads to qualitatively different signatures . </S>",
    "<S> we first examine the reach of the lhc via the canonical @xmath0 and multilepton channels that have been advocated within the msugra framework . </S>",
    "<S> next , we examine special features of each of these model lines that could serve to further enhance the susy signal over standard model backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> we use isajet to evaluate the susy reach of experiments at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the susy reach , measured in terms of @xmath1 , is at least as large , and sometimes larger , than in the msugra framework . in the best case of the co - nlsp scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the reach extends to @xmath2  tev , assuming 10 @xmath3 of integrated luminosity . </S>"
