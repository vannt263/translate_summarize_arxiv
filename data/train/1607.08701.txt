    "( ii ) when nitrogen is added during deposition , a fcc structure is formed , irrespective of the amount of nitrogen used during sputtering .",
    "( iii ) properties of pure co and that of co - n films ( for any @xmath1 ) are different with respect to structural , electronic and magnetic properties .    as far as pure co film deposited at @xmath0  = 523k  is concerned , appearance of fcc co phase already at this @xmath0  is somewhat surprising as the transition temperature from hcp to fcc structure for bulk co is 690k  or above  @xcite .",
    "however in case of thin films , it has been observed that such transition from hcp to fcc phase can occur at much lower ( than bulk ) transition temperature ( 690k ) as observed by carbel @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the behavior of the films deposited in the presence of nitrogen is surprising as an increase in @xmath1  is expected to increase in n .",
    "generally for other systems like fe - n , it has been observed that the addition of nitrogen during deposition results in n  enhancement almost up to mononitride composition ( 1:1 for fe : n ) .",
    "similarly , when co - n films are deposited at @xmath0  = 300k  they show an evolution of phases , starting with few  of n to 50  n as @xmath1  increases from 5 to 100  @xcite .    therefore",
    ", our observation that independent of @xmath1  ( at @xmath0= 523k ) used , the phases form are always similar , is surprising and such behavior has not been seen before for the co - n system . on the other hand",
    "a lot of experimental reports are available , claiming the formation of @xmath4  phase at @xmath0  varying from 433k to 723k  @xcite .",
    "use of such higher @xmath0  might have been influenced by @xmath6  phase which is generally formed at @xmath0@xmath2673k .    a comparison between the theoretical and experimentally observed values of lp can be used to understand the results obtained in this work . from our xrd data ,",
    "we find a slight increment in the lp of co - n samples as compared to the pure co film deposited at 523k .",
    "theoretical values of lp for fcc co and @xmath4  are 3.54 and 3.74 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this implies that for @xmath4  ( at n 20 ) composition , the lattice dilation should be about 5 .",
    "however , the experimental data available for @xmath4  films shows that the value of lp are 3.586 at 433k  @xcite , 3.524 at 523k  @xcite , 3.524 at 723k  @xcite etc .",
    "this implies that the dilation in the lp of @xmath4  phase obtain experimentally so far is @xmath20.5 to 1  only , against the expected value of @xmath25 .",
    "however , when @xmath4  films are deposited at @xmath0  = 300k , the measured value of lp is 3.7 , quite close to the theoretical lp of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "our data presented in this work , also imply that an expansion of typically 0.5  in the lp would correspond to 2 - 3 n  ( in agreement with sims measurements ) .",
    "this result clearly indicate that , when co - n films are deposited at @xmath0@xmath9300k , n  in resulting co - n films is significantly low as compared to those obtained in fe - n system .",
    "the reason for such behavior can be investigated while looking in the thermodynamics of co - n system .",
    "it is known that the enthalpy of formation ( @xmath34h@xmath35 ) for @xmath6  is -12.2(@xmath1820)kj / mol  @xcite , however the value of @xmath34h@xmath35 for co - n system are not yet known explicitly . in theoretical calculation carried by hglund @xmath36 ,  @xcite ,",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath34h@xmath35 increases as one moves along 3d series from ti to ni which means that the thermal stability of metal nitrides should decreases as z increases in the 3d series  @xcite . in our recent study , we measured the thermal stability of @xmath4  films formed at @xmath0  = 300k .",
    "here it was found that above a temperature of 423k , significant nitrogen diffusion starts to take place .",
    "it seems at high @xmath0 , rapid n diffusion takes place leaving behind pure co with together with a reminiscent fraction of @xmath4 .",
    "it is interesting to see that fcc phase is formed for any @xmath1  used during sputtering , which also indicate that n atoms diffuse out form a parent fcc @xmath4  phase .",
    "in addition since samples deposited at @xmath0  = 523k  have somewhat higher ms than pure co , and they are also stable upto 623k , is an interesting observation that can be used to prepare fcc co films .",
    "obtained results provide an important information about the co - n system and a recipe of preparation of @xmath4  films which should involve low @xmath0  instead of higher temperature used in other works .",
    "in this work we did a systematic study of co - n thin films deposited at @xmath0  = 523k using @xmath1  = 0 , 25 , 50 , 75 and 100 . from our sims , xrd , xas , moke and pnr measurements , we found a clear difference between samples deposited with or without nitrogen during sputtering . however",
    "a variation in @xmath1  seems to cause not much difference among samples even as @xmath1  is varied from 25 to 100 .",
    "this is a counter intuitive result which can be understood as the @xmath34h@xmath35 for the @xmath4  might be much larger , resulting in poor thermal stability leading to rapid diffusion of n atoms .",
    "in such a scenario when co - n films are deposited at high @xmath0 , n atoms diffuse out , leaving behind a fcc co phase which has been often mistaken for a fcc @xmath4  phase .",
