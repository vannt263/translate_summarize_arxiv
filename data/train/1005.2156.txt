    "crystalline bilayers of graphene ( blg ) produced by mechanical exfoliation of thin graphite or by thermal decomposition of silicon carbide have recently attracted a great deal of attention because of their many unique electronic properties  @xcite .",
    "blg quasiparticles behave at low energies like massive chiral fermions  @xcite and exhibit a plethora of interesting properties , including broken - symmetry states at very weak magnetic fields when the bilayer is suspended  @xcite to reduce disorder , and anomalous exciton condensation in the quantum hall regime  @xcite .",
    "since blg consists of two single - layer graphene ( slg ) systems separated by a small distance @xmath0   , one expects inter - layer electron - electron interactions be crucial to the physics of this system . with this motivation , many - body effects in blg",
    "have already been studied by several authors  @xcite .",
    "particular attention has been devoted to the study of interaction effects close to charge neutrality  @xcite ( see also ref .  ) where it has been shown that blg is prone to a number of interesting instabilities , including sublattice pseudospin ferromagnetism - a type of orbital order which leads to spontaneous inversion symmetry  @xcite breaking .",
    "thermodynamic quantities such as the electronic compressibility @xmath1 or the spin susceptibility @xmath2 are very powerful probes of exchange and correlation effects in interacting many - electron systems  @xcite since they are intimately linked with the equation of state .",
    "the electronic compressibility of a conventional parabolic - band two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas was first measured by eisenstein _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in 1992 .",
    "for sufficiently low densities , and zero magnetic fields , it was found that the inverse thermodynamic density - of - states , which is proportional to @xmath3 , changes sign becoming _ negative _ , a fact that can be easily explained by properly including exchange contributions to the free - electron equation of state  @xcite . in an ordinary 2d electron gas corrections to the compressibility due to correlation effects omitted in hartree - fock approximations are relatively small .",
    "the  field penetration technique \" introduced in ref .   and later discussed in great detail in ref .   actually uses a double - layer 2d electron system made up of _ two _ closely - spaced 2d electron gases and can also be used to accurately measure the compressibility of blg .    in this work we present a calculation of the electronic compressibility of blg based on the four - band continuum model .",
    "we include beyond - hartree - fock correlation contributions to the ground - state energy by using a random phase approximation .",
    "we demonstrate that the correlation contribution to the compressibility in blg is crucial when dielectric screening is weak and interactions within the graphene sheet are strong .",
    "indeed , neglect of correlation effects leads to an error of the order of @xmath4% in the case of suspended bilayers .",
    "we compare our results for the compressibility of blg with those obtained earlier for slg  @xcite and are able to clearly identify the physical origin of the main differences . for simplicity",
    "we assume here that the bilayer remains in a normal fermi - liquid state down to very low densities .",
    "the behavior of the compressibility when one of the exotic low - density phases predicted in refs .",
    "is approached from the high - density fermi - liquid phase is beyond the scope of the present theory .",

    "[ sect : mainresults ] .",
    "we restrict our attention in this article to the case of a balanced bilayer in which inversion symmetry is not broken by an electrical potential difference between the layers .",
    "when a potential difference is present a gap opens up in the single - particle energy spectrum  @xcite ; there is no gap between conduction and valence bands in the balanced bilayer limit that we consider .",
    "we also neglect trigonal warping effects in the bands which become important only at very low densities at which disorder effects normally dominate .",

    "blg is modeled as two slg systems separated by a distance @xmath5 and coupled by both inter - layer hopping and coulomb interactions .",
    "most of the properties we discuss below depend qualitatively on the bernal stacking arrangement in which one sublattice ( say @xmath6 ) of the top layer is a near - neighbor of the opposite sublattice ( say @xmath7 ) of the bottom layer . neglecting trigonal warping ,",

    "we evaluate interaction energies using a coupling - constant - integration scheme which expresses energies in terms of electronic equal - time correlation functions .",
    "the correlation functions can then be related to response functions using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "when this commonly used approach  @xcite is adapted to the case of blg , we see from @xmath41 that two response functions are necessary for the evaluation of ground - state properties of blg  @xcite : the total - density response function , @xmath42 and the density - difference response function @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the kubo product  @xcite , @xmath45\\rangle~,\\ ] ] @xmath46 being the ground - state expectation value .    at this point",
    "the reader might wonder why we have not introduced the mixed sum and difference response functions , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . as explained in ref .",

    "this behavior contrasts with that of ordinary 2d electron gases in which hf theory predicts a negative compressibility below a critical density that is moderate , and only weakly influenced by correlations .",
    "this qualitative behavior difference is a consequence of the relevance of exchange interactions with both conduction and valence bands , and of the sublattice pseudospin chirality of the bands .",
    "the same mechanisms are also responsible for a thermodynamic density - of - states that is suppressed rather than enhanced in slg  @xcite . like an ordinary 2d electron gas",
    ", blg has an intra - conduction - band exchange contribution to its chemical potential that is negative and proportional to @xmath118 ; this energy is however approximately half as large in the blg case because the wavefunctions are spread over more than one sublattice .",
    "the tendency toward a negative compressibility is further countered in the blg case by inter - band exchange , which yields a chemical potential contribution that is also proportional to @xmath118 in the low - density limit , but positive .",
    "the end result is that the low - carrier density negative @xmath118 exchange contribution to the chemical potential , which would yield a negative compressibility , is approximately six times smaller ( for the same background dielectric constant ) in blg than in an ordinary 2d electron gas .",

    "we find numerically that in the random phase approximation the low - density negative compressibility does not survive correlations .",
    "this compressibility anomaly is in any event likely to be preempted by blg s low - density ferroelectric instability  @xcite , which is driven by physics beyond that captured by the rpa as discussed above .",

    "[ fig : three ] look rather similar to the hf ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] .",
    "however , we clearly see that for dopings below @xmath128 correlation effects are quantitatively very important .",
    "for instance , percentage values of the ratio @xmath129 ( between the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] and the hf data in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] ) are of the order of @xmath130% for @xmath131 and larger than @xmath4% for a suspended bilayer ( @xmath132 ) .    for the sake of comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] we have also plotted @xmath115 for suspended ( @xmath132 ) slg . as expected , the difference between dlg and slg compressibilities is very small at high doping , especially so when all four bands @xmath133 are occupied . at low densities , however , the results are very different since in this regime the blg spectrum approaches a parabolic form @xmath134 , with @xmath135 , strongly deviating from the slg linear dispersion .",
    "in particular , note that @xmath115 diverges for @xmath136 in the slg case , while it approaches a finite value for blg . this striking difference stems from the behavior of the blg quasiparticle effective mass @xmath137 , which remains finite when doping approaches zero  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : four ] we plot the ratio @xmath138 , @xmath139^{-1}$ ] being the compressibility of the noninteracting system .",
    "we clearly see from this plot that the main effect of electron - electron interactions is to suppress @xmath1 .",
    "this can be easily understood within the landau theory of normal fermi liquids .",
    "indeed @xmath138 is largely controlled by and proportional to @xmath140 and , as demonstrated in ref .  , the role of interactions is to suppress @xmath137 with respect to the bare value , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath141 . as explained in ref .   for the case of slg ,",

    "[ fig : two]-[fig : three ] .",
    "note that the ratio @xmath138 is smaller than unity , the more so the stronger electron - electron interactions are.[fig : four],width=340 ]    we now turn to a discussion of the compressibility in the extreme low - density limit , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : five ] . as discussed above and first explained by kusminskiy _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the compressibility becomes negative at extremely low densities in the hf approximation because of a small net contribution to the chemical potential that is negative and proportional to @xmath118 .",
    "this contribution to the compressibility is reminiscent of the larger but related contribution to the chemical potential which appears in an ordinary 2d electron gas . because the relative strength of interactions and band - energies in that case can be absorbed in a length scale change , the @xmath118 exchange energy can be viewed as the leading order term in an expansion of energy in powers of @xmath144 .",
    "the leading order correlation contribution to the chemical potential is therefore proportional to @xmath145 ( up to logarithmic factors ) and does not appear in the compressibility .",
    "this simple scaling property does not apply to blg , because the inter - layer hopping and in - plane hopping terms in the continuum - limit hamiltonian do not scale in the same way with density .",
    "the chemical potential and energy per particle have to be expanded separately in terms of powers of @xmath118 and the interaction scale @xmath101 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : five ] we find numerically that both the exchange and correlation contributions to the chemical potential change sign at very low carrier densities , in such a way that the total chemical potential is a monotonically increasing function of energy .",
    "in fact we find that the ratio @xmath138 is smallest at low density : in other words , as it is also clear from figs .",
    "[ fig : two]-[fig : three ] , the enhancement of @xmath115 relative to the noninteracting system results becomes larger for lower carrier densities .",
    "the competing role of exchange and correlations here is similar to their role in the spin - susceptibility .",
    "the exchange energy favors spin - polarization by lowering the chemical potential of each spin when its occupation increases .",
    "when correlations are included , the energy depends more on the total density and less on its partitioning into spin components .",
    "similarly here the exchange energy favors occupation of the higher subband at low - densities because of the large coulomb interaction matrix elements when the fermi radius is small .",
    "when correlations - which are less sensitive to interactions between quasiparticles at the fermi energy - are restored , the sensitivity to band index is reduced and the overall trend in the dependence of chemical potential on density is restored .    ) as functions of the carrier density @xmath74 in units of @xmath146 .",
    "these results refer to @xmath147.[fig : five],width=340 ]",
    "in summary , we have calculated the compressibility of crystalline bilayer graphene beyond the hartree - fock approximation by treating correlation effects at the random - phase - approximation level .",
    "we have shown that electron - electron interactions suppress the compressibility quite substantially with correlation effects playing an important quantitative role .",
    "the reduction of compressibility stands in stark contrast to the large compressibility enhancements that occur in regular two - dimensional electron gas systems , even though the two systems share the same parabolic dispersions .",
    "the source of the qualitatively different behavior is the importance in bilayer graphene of exchange interactions between carriers in the conduction band and the full negative energy dirac sea .",
    "the suppression of the compressibility has the same origin as the enhancement of quasiparticle effective mass .",
    "both phenomena ultimately originate from the chiral nature of the low - energy spectrum .",
    "the present results demonstrate that correlations play an essential role in quantitative studies of interaction effects in bilayer graphene .",
    "previous work  @xcite has suggested that neutral bilayers might become unstable to spontaneous layer polarization when disorder is weak .",
    "the role of long - range coulomb interactions in the physics of this instability could be addressed by extending the calculations described here to the case in which there is an electric potential difference between layers .",
    "one complication associated with this elaboration is that inversion symmetry is explicitly broken so that correlations between even and odd parity density fluctuations are non - zero .",
    "the more complicated form for the subband spinors of the band eigenstates also makes the task of finding quasi - analytic results for the noninteracting system polarization ( lindhard ) functions challenging . in the present calculation the semi - analytic results we have used for the lindhard function  @xcite are extremely helpful and allow the wavevector and frequency integrals to be evaluated numerically with confidence and precision , in spite of the numerical subtleties that lurk in the integrands .",
    "it is difficult to obtain accurate results when the lindhard function is evaluated by brute - force numerics .",
    "although this lies outside the scope of the present paper , we anticipate that correlation effects will lower predictions for the amount of charge transferred between the layers .    after this work was complete we learned of three recent experimental studies  @xcite which measure the compressibility of blg .",
    "all three groups find that , in the balanced limit , @xmath115 has a peak near zero carrier density and then decreases monotonically with increasing carrier density ; the change of sign at low densities which appears in an ordinary two - dimensional electron gas is absent in blg , in agreement with our findings .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that these experimental results can be strongly influenced by interactions so that some caution must be exercised in fitting compressibility measurements to band - structure models .",
