    "in classical optics , the state of polarization of a light beam is visualized by stokes vector on the poincare sphere @xcite and it is determined by four stokes parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , following the relation @xmath2 .",
    "these stokes parameters involve coherence functions @xcite of order ( 1,1 ) and it has been realized that these are insufficient to describe polarization completely as @xmath3 does not represent only unpolarized light @xcite .",
    "but , these parameters still remain important because of their role in non - classicalities associated with polarization .",
    "quantum mechanical analogue of stokes parameters can also be defined to characterize quantum nature of polarization .",
    "these quantum stokes operators hermitian in nature and act as observables for the system .",
    "these hermitian stokes operators can be defined as the quantum versions of their classical counterparts and these are given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 refer to the photon annihilation and creation operators respectively of the two orthogonal polarization modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 satisfying the commutation relations @xmath8=\\delta_{jk } $ ] for @xmath9 .",
    "the mean value of the radius of quantum poincare sphere is given by square root of expectation value of either side of the equation @xmath10 note that , stokes operators do not commute with each other and hence this equation has an extra term @xmath11 on the right hand side .",
    "thus , a quantum polarization state is described by the four stokes operators , @xmath12 which is the total photon number operator denoting the beam intensity and @xmath13 with commutation relations @xmath14=0 , [ \\hat s_j , \\hat s_k]=2i{\\sum_{l}\\epsilon_{jkl}}~\\hat s_{l},\\ ] ] following the su(2 ) algebra . here , @xmath15 is levi - civita symbol for @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "these relations are parallel to the commutation relations for components of the angular momentum operator .",
    "these non - zero commutators show that simultaneous exact measurement of the quantities represented by these stokes operators are impossible and the following uncertainty relations hold @xmath18 here @xmath19 stands for the variance @xmath20 of the quantum stokes operators @xmath21 .",
    "+ polarization squeezing is a non - classicality similar to ordinary squeezing , and is defined almost in a similar fashion using stokes operators as the continuous variables for the system describing polarization .",
    "polarization squeezing first introduced by chirkin et al .",
    "@xcite was initially defined using the commutation relations followed by the stokes operators .",
    "later , this definition was modified by heersink et al .",
    "@xcite taking into account the uncertainty relations followed by these stokes operators and generalized by luis and korolkova @xcite for a general component of stokes operator vector .",
    "the authors have written the criterion for polarization squeezing for a general component of stokes vector operator @xmath22 along the unit vector @xmath23 @xcite in the following form @xmath24 arguing that , there are infinite directions @xmath25 for a given component @xmath26 and therefore one needs to consider the maximum possible value of @xmath27 .",
    "all of the above definitions have been used in different studies on polarization squeezing @xcite in the order of improvement considering the uncertainty relations and characterization of polarization squeezing in a general component of stokes operator vector . in our study",
    ", we use the criterion in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) for polarization squeezing , which is the most general and based on the actual uncertainty relations . squeezing factor @xmath28 and degree of squeezing @xmath29 to measure polarization squeezing can be defined as @xmath30 respectively .",
    "non - classicalities are seen when @xmath31 and the degree of squeezing @xmath32 lies between @xmath33 and @xmath34 . +",
    "since , quantum stokes operators and non - classical polarization can be used for quantum information protocols in quantum communication , it is important to study polarization squeezing in such systems .",
    "another convenience reason being the easy measurement of stokes parameters using linear optical elements , polarization squeezing is easy to experimentally measure .",
    "the direct measurement schemes are developed methods for measuring these parameters and they preserve quantum noise property . + in the present paper , we study a process where linear beam splitter mixes coherent light with a two mode squeezed vacuum and it is observed that , the output beam from the beam splitter exhibits polarization squeezing . illustration in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] shows the superposition on linear polarization beam splitter .",
    "the input non - classical light is a two mode squeezed vacuum which does not show polarization squeezing .",
    "the linear beam splitter can not convert classical light beams into non - classical though nonlinear beam splitters do .",
    "the polarization squeezing at the output port @xmath35 therefore shows that , the input non - classical beam gives non - classicality in the output .",
    "+ if the two mode coherent light beam incident at ports @xmath36 and two mode squeezed vacuum at port @xmath37 , are represented by annihilation operators @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively and output at ports @xmath35 and @xmath40 have annihilation operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , for the two mode coherent state @xmath43 we have @xmath44 and for two mode squeezed vacuum @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 being the interaction time for nonlinear interaction . after this superposition ,",
    "the beams at ports @xmath35 and @xmath40 can be represented as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the transmission coefficient and reflection coefficients , respectively .",
    "+ in this problem , we are only interested in port @xmath35 and we can write the @xmath6 and @xmath7 modes of the annihilation operator at the output port @xmath51 as @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 being the transmission coefficient and reflection coefficient , respectively for the two modes . + to have an idea about the non - classicality in mixing of two light beams , let us consider , the two input beams having density operators @xmath55 the composite density operator cab therefore be written as @xmath56}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\exp{[\\alpha a^\\dagger+\\beta b^\\dagger-{h.c.}]}{|{0.0}\\rangle}{\\langle{0,0}|}\\exp{[\\alpha^ * a + \\beta^ * b-{h.c.}]},\\nonumber\\\\    \\label{eq11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where _ h.c._stands for hermitian conjugate .",
    "this leads to @xmath57 and hence @xmath58 where @xmath59 . +",
    "this shows that , if @xmath60 and @xmath61 are non negative , @xmath62 also has a non - negative value and classical input light beams mix at a linear beam splitter to generate classical output light beams .",
    "however , if one of @xmath60 and @xmath61 is not non - negative , @xmath62 would also be non - negative and input non - classical beam gives non - classicality in the output .",
    "generation of anti - bunched light by mixing of squeezed light with classical light is a very well known example .",
    "we observe here the non - classicality in the form of polarization squeezing exhibited here in a similar manner .",
    "the two mode squeezed vacuum as shown in the eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) can also be represented as , @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the annihilation operators initially and @xmath65 at time @xmath49 after the non - degenerate parametric amplification . for initial vacuum state ,",
    "straight calculations give @xmath66 it is easy to see by plugging in the values in the inequality criterion for polarization squeezing given by eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) that , none of the stokes operators show polarization squeezing .",
    "but , it is very important to notice that the squeezed vacuum is observed squeezed in polarization@xcite when the first criterion for polarization squeezing @xcite is used , however , the two mode squeezed vacuum shows no squeezing in polarization on using the general criterion that considers uncertainty relation followed by stokes operators in addition to the commutation relations .",
    "we observe that it does not exhibit any squeezing in polarization as per the general criteria @xcite for a general component of stokes operator vector .",
    "after mixing of the coherent beam and squeezed vacuum , the mean values and variances of the stokes operators at the output port @xmath35 represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) for @xmath67 can be calculated as    @xmath68    and    @xmath69    we now consider the polarization squeezing under the approximation @xmath70 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the transmitted parts of coherent light in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 modes have the same amplitude which is very large as compared to @xmath71 .",
    "this is to note that , if we do not consider large interaction times which allows us to ignore the higher order terms in @xmath72 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we can test the polarization squeezing along all the three stokes operators as shown below .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) , squeezing factor can be written as @xmath88 this expression can be minimized for @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and it leads to maximum squeezing for @xmath91 with squeezing factor resulting into the same expression as in the previous case .",

    "+ above results show that the squeezed vacuum is not polarization squeezed in itself , but when mixed with a coherent beam , the output beam exhibits polarization squeezing along all the three components of stokes operator vector for @xmath89 but different combinations of @xmath98 .",
    "we observe that the output light is most squeezed in polarization along the stokes parameters @xmath75 and equally squeezed along @xmath87 and @xmath93 .",
    "the variation of squeezing factor and degree of squeezing with @xmath50 , corresponding to maximum polarization squeezing in @xmath99 and @xmath100 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] .     and @xmath101 with @xmath50 showing maximum polarization squeezing . ]",
    "looking at the above expressions for squeezing factor , one can observe that , it can be made less than one by choosing @xmath50 small .",
    "this gives high degree of polarization squeezing .",
    "as a special case , if we consider this linear beam splitter to be symmetric one , @xmath102 that gives the minimum squeezing factor @xmath103 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath104 . however , in the case of @xmath87 and @xmath87 , we have @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "this reveals a maximum of @xmath107 squeezing at the output port @xmath35 and this is observed along @xmath75 .",
    "we therefore observe that squeezed vacuum on mixing with a coherent radiation through a beam splitter leads to polarization squeezing in the output light .",
    "this is important because the nature of non - classicality changes during the interaction and up to @xmath108 squeezing in polarization is obtained without initial non - classicality of same nature . in our next manuscript",
