    "on july 4th 2012 the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations announced the discovery of a scalar particle at cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "this new particle with a mass of about @xmath8 gev was later identified as the higgs boson , responsible for the generation of all particle masses through the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "so far , the measured properties of the higgs boson have shown a remarkable consistency with those predicted by the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "nevertheless , it is by now clear that the sm can not explain all the observed physical phenomena , as for instance it fails to provide a candidate for dark matter or a means to explain the matter anti - matter asymmetry in the universe .",
    "however , as more data is being accumulated and analysed at the lhc , it becomes increasingly clear that any new physics theory has to resemble very much the sm at the electroweak scale . in the first run ,",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations have studied in great detail the main four higgs production modes at the lhc  @xcite , namely gluon fusion ( including @xmath9 fusion ) , vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , associated production ( @xmath10 , with @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 production , with centre of mass energies of 7 and 8 tev . for each production mode several decay channels were considered and analysed in great detail .",
    "the production of the higgs boson in association with a top quark - anti - quark pair , @xmath13  @xcite , constitutes the only way ( together with single top plus higgs which has an even smaller cross section ) to directly probe the top - quark yukawa couplings .",
    "moreover , it is also contaminated by a huge background coming mainly from @xmath14 . for this particular production process",
    "several decay channels have been studied  @xcite .",
    "the very complex final states , together with the huge backgrounds to the process , makes it the most difficult higgs channel to study at the lhc .",
    "nevertheless , with just a few events , both collaborations have reach a sensitivity down to about 2  3 times the sm value which constitutes a remarkable achievement .",
    "the current studies  @xcite , use the kinematic information of the events to separate the signal from the backgrounds . in this work we advocate the introduction of new variables that make use of the information from ( lack of ) spin correlations in the signal and background processes  @xcite : the top and anti - top quarks are natural spin analysers of this process .",
    "we will show that part of the spin information that is present in the matrix elements survives the parton showering , detector simulation , event selection and event reconstruction .",
    "these new variables could play an important role in background discrimination , possibly leading to an improvement in the precision of the measurement of the top - quark yukawa coupling . even though we will consider only the irreducible @xmath5 background , without a highly - optimized event - reconstruction method",
    ", we will argue that our findings are also valid in a more general and realistic case .",
    "we should also note that the type of variables proposed in this work can then be used to probe the cp nature of the top - yukawa coupling  @xcite .",
    "in many models like the cp - violating two - higgs doublet model  @xcite ( the status of this model after the lhc run 1 was recently presented in  @xcite ) , cp violation appears explicitly in the higgs sector via mixing of cp - even and cp - odd states .",
    "the determination of the cp nature of the higgs boson and its interactions is of the utmost importance at the lhc .",
    "finally one should note that @xmath6 production can be studied at future linear colliders such as the ilc , which will lead to a tremendous improvement in the precision of measurements of the yukawa couplings  @xcite .",
    "given that the goal of this work is to study how well spin information can be used to improve the current search strategies , we only consider the signal and its dominant irreducible background .",
    "the signal ( @xmath12 ) and background ( @xmath15 ) processes were generated , at leading order ( lo ) , using madgraph5amc@nlo  @xcite with the nnpdf2.3 pdf sets  @xcite .",
    "the full spin correlations information of the @xmath16 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays , with @xmath17 , was retained by allowing madspin  @xcite to perform the decay of the heavy particles . although other decay modes of the top quarks and higgs boson could be considered , in this paper we focus on the most challenging leptonic decay channel i.e. , the dileptonic decay of the @xmath18 system together with a higgs decaying to the dominant sm decay ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we argue the full kinematical reconstruction of the undetected neutrinos in such events , even if difficult , still preserves the angular distributions that could help in discriminating signal from irreducible backgrounds .",
    "the events were generated for the lhc with a centre of mass energy of 13  tev with the default dynamic factorization and renormalization scales , setting the masses of the top quark and the sm higgs boson to @xmath20  gev and @xmath8  gev , respectively .",
    "we do not attempt to investigate possible departures from the sm nature of the higgs boson in this paper , assumed to be a scalar particle ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the generated events were then passed to pythia 6  @xcite for shower and hadronization . in order to obtain more realistic results , for example for differential cross sections and efficiencies",
    ", we passed the generated events through delphes  @xcite to perform a fast detector simulation of a general - purpose collider experiment at the lhc .",
    "we used the atlas default card for the simulation and performed the analysis of the generated and simulated events with madanalysis 5  @xcite in the expert mode  @xcite .",
    "the full kinematical reconstruction of @xmath6 events is very challenging in the dileptonic decays of the @xmath18 system , since both undetected neutrinos need to be reconstructed . in this paper",
    ", we explore the advantages of fully reconstructing the @xmath6 system in the dileptonic topology , by applying a kinematic fit to the events using mass constraints and energy - momentum conservation .",
    "events , after detector simulation , are accepted if they had at least four reconstructed jets and two charged leptons with transverse momentum @xmath22  gev and pseudo - rapidity @xmath23 .",
    "no cuts are applied to the events transverse missing energy ( @xmath24 ) . in the following",
    "we will normalise the distributions of signal and background to equal area , irrespective of their ( fiducial ) cross sections and efficiencies : for our goal it suffices to show which observables are sensitive to the difference in spin information in the signal and background events and how well this information can be retained in a realistically reconstructed event .",
    "for the same reason we also abstain from performing a careful analysis of the uncertainties in the event generation as well as the inclusion of next - to - leading order corrections in the strong coupling .",
    "as previously stated we will perform @xmath25 event reconstruction in final states with two charged leptons and at least four jets , after delphes simulation .",
    "we do not attempt to tag the flavour of jets from the hadronization of @xmath26 quarks , i.e. , we do not use any @xmath26-tagging tool to help with the identification of the heavy flavour component of jets ; a task left outside the scope of this paper .",
    "the full kinematical reconstruction requires the knowledge of the jet and charged lepton momenta , together with the transverse missing energy .",
    "we use the @xmath27 and the top quark masses as constraints .",
    "the higgs boson mass ( @xmath28  gev ) is used to maximise the probability of the best combination of two jets chosen among the ones which were not utilised in the @xmath18 system kinematical reconstruction .",
    "the transverse missing energy is re - fitted to improve the resolution of the experimental measurement . after applying the constraints ,",
    "six unknowns need to be fully reconstructed in the dileptonic @xmath25 events , which are the 3-momenta of the two neutrinos present in the events . to find a kinematic solution",
    "we assume the neutrinos are responsible for the missing transverse energy , i.e. , @xmath29 in addition we apply the following mass constraints to the @xmath18 system of the events , @xmath30 while @xmath31 represent the @xmath32 and @xmath33 components of the transverse missing energy , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) correspond to the two lepton ( two @xmath26-jets ) four momenta , respectively , from the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) decays .",
    "@xmath38 are the @xmath27-boson and top quark masses , respectively .",
    "the mass of the @xmath27-boson was set to @xmath39  gev .",
    "we study the performance of the reconstruction with respect to the generated parton - level monte carlo information . to make sure the kinematical reconstruction produces sensible results ,",
    "the reconstruction is first applied to truth - matched objects , i.e. , jets and leptons which are matched to their parton - level generated quarks and charged leptons , using a @xmath40 criterion ( the minimum distance in the pseudorapidity - azimuthal angle plane , @xmath40 , between the reconstructed jet or lepton and the parton - level quark or charged lepton , ensures the matching ) . even though we use a rather simple kinematical reconstruction method the efficiency using truth - matched objects",
    "is 62% . in figure",
    "[ fig : genrec_rec1 ] the neutrino ( left ) and antineutrino ( right ) @xmath41 from signal events are shown .",
    "the generated distributions ( filled histograms ) are compared with the truth - match reconstructed ones ( solid lines ) . in the bottom plot ,",
    "the ratio between the two distributions is shown .",
    "although a slight slope is visible in the ratio plot , more significant at high @xmath42 due to radiation effects not explicitly corrected for at the moment , good agreement between the reconstructed distributions is observed with respect to the parton - level neutrino distributions , making clear that the full kinematical reconstruction of @xmath6 events is possible . in figures  [ fig : genrec_rec2 ] and  [ fig : genrec_rec3 ] the @xmath42 distributions of the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) quarks and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) bosons are shown , respectively , for the @xmath6 events .",
    "once again we see a similar behaviour as observed for the neutrino @xmath42 distributions , i.e. , good agreement between the reconstructed kinematic distributions and the corresponding ones at parton level , in spite of the slight slope for higher @xmath42 values , in the ratio plot .",
    "although the kinematical fit can correct , to a large extend , the effects of radiation , at high values the differences between reconstructed and generated distributions may require an additional correction . even though this would not difficult to implement ,",
    "we have decide not to apply it here once it may depend on the exact experimental environment conditions and does not contribute significantly to the main discussion of the paper .    in a second step ,",
    "the truth match condition is dropped , bringing the analysis closer to what can be done at collider experiments . for this particular case",
    "we perform all possible combinations of reconstructed jets and charged leptons ( after detector simulation ) in order to reconstruct the top and anti - top quarks , together with the higgs boson . for the @xmath18 system reconstruction we used the same procedure based on equations eq .  - .",
    "we calculate the probability @xmath45 that the event is compatible with the equations , using probability density functions for the neutrino and anti - neutrino @xmath42 distributions , the top and anti - top quarks mass distributions as well as the @xmath43 and @xmath44 bosons mass distributions , obtained at parton level . to identify the two - jet combination , among the ones not used in the @xmath18 reconstruction , that best matches the jets from the higgs boson decay , we associate to each combination , a weight @xmath46",
    ", @xmath47 related to how close the higgs boson mass ( @xmath28  gev ) is to the invariant mass of each particular jet - pair combination .",
    "the solution with highest @xmath48 is chosen as the right one for the full kinematical reconstruction of the events .",
    "this fixes completely the assignment of jets and charged leptons to their parent @xmath36 , @xmath37 quarks and higgs boson . due to the increase in the number of possible combinations which can satisfy eq",
    ".  - , 88% of all events are reconstructed by the kinematic fit .",
    "this will obviously lead to an increase of the combinatorial background but , as we will see later , the kinematics are in most cases distinct from the right combinations . in figures  [ fig : genrec_exp2 ] and  [ fig : genrec_exp3 ] we show the @xmath42 distributions of the top quarks and @xmath27 bosons , respectively . the kinematically reconstructed @xmath42 , with no jets and leptons truth match ,",
    "is compared with the parton - level distribution .",
    "we see a good correlation between the kinematically reconstructed distributions with respect to the parton - level ones , thus ensuring that the reconstruction works fairly well .",
    "we did not attempt to further optimise the event reconstruction because , again , the main goal here is to show that a reconstruction is possible with a reasonable efficiency .",
    "we will focus on angular distributions in fully reconstructed @xmath6 events involving three - dimensional angles between the decay products of the @xmath6 dileptonic final states . following the full reconstruction of events ,",
    "we define two reference frames :    * frame 1 : the full @xmath6 centre - of - mass system , built by using the laboratory four - momenta and , * frame 2 : the @xmath49 centre - of - mass system recoiling against the @xmath36 quark , in the @xmath6 system ( i.e. , in frame 1 as defined above ) .    for the generated distributions ( with and without the @xmath42 and @xmath50 cuts applied in the event selection )",
    ", we use the parton - level four - momenta of all relevant objects . for the reconstructed distributions ( with and without truth match ) , we use the four - momenta obtained after applying the kinematic fit reconstruction . we define the angle between the higgs momentum direction ( in the @xmath49 centre - of - mass ) with respect to the @xmath49 direction ( in the @xmath6 system ) as @xmath51 and the angle of the @xmath52 top quarks or higgs decay products ( @xmath43,@xmath44,@xmath53,@xmath54 , @xmath26 and @xmath55 jets ) momentum ( in the higgs centre - of - mass system ) with respect to the higgs direction ( in the @xmath49 system ) as @xmath56 .",
    "we should stress the fact that , when boosting @xmath52 to the centre of mass of the higgs boson , the laboratory four - momenta were used ( in a direct , rotation - free boost ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : genncang1 ] we show distributions at parton level , without any cuts , for the product of @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , for @xmath59(left ) and @xmath60(right ) .",
    "we can see the distributions are quite different between signal and background events .",
    "the effect of applying the @xmath42 and @xmath50 cuts to jets and leptons is seen in figure  [ fig : genwcang1 ] . a clear reduction on the number of events is observed due to the cuts applied . in figure",
    "[ fig : recang1 ] we can see the effect of the kinematic fit reconstruction , still with the truth match information .",
    "the information on the angular distribution is preserved to a large extent , even after the full kinematical reconstruction .",
    "as we will see this is also true when the reconstruction is performed without truth match . in figure",
    "[ fig : expang1 ] we show the reconstructed product ( without truth match ) of @xmath61 and @xmath58 , for @xmath59(left ) and @xmath60(right ) . in figures  [ fig : expang2 ] and  [ fig : expang3 ] we show the same distributions but with the charged leptons replaced by the @xmath27-bosons and @xmath26-quarks from the higgs decay , respectively .",
    "it is quite apparent that some of the angular distributions allow discrimination between signal and background even after the full kinematical reconstruction without the truth match .",
    "since we did not try to optimise the kinematical reconstruction , it is foreseeable that better results could be obtained in the future .",
    "based on the angular distributions introduced in the previous section , we propose to use several forward - backward asymmetries ( @xmath62 ) in this paper , defined using the double angular product + @xmath63 the asymmetries can be easily calculated , both at parton level and after the kinematic fit reconstruction , and are defined as , @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 correspond to the total number of events in the corresponding angular distribution with @xmath67 above and below zero , respectively .",
    "these asymmetries can be quite different between the signal @xmath6 and the irreducible background @xmath7 . in table",
    "[ tab : asymgenexp ] we present the values of the asymmetries , with no cuts applied to the events , at parton level ( and at lo ) for different choices of the final state particle ( @xmath52 ) that is boosted to the centre of mass of the higgs boson .",
    "as we can see , there are clear differences for some of the asymmetries i.e. , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ( @xmath55 from @xmath37 ) , between signal and background .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : genncasym1 ] an example of two - binned angular distributions for @xmath60 and @xmath59 , respectively , evaluated at parton level without any @xmath42 or @xmath50 cuts applied to the events .",
    ".values for the asymmetry for @xmath6 and @xmath7 events at the lhc .",
