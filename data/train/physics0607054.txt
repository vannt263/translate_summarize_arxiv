    "understanding the origin and the evolution of language or more generally of communication systems is a fascinating challenge for the interdisciplinary scientific community  @xcite , demanding contributions to researchers in very different fields , from linguistics to artificial intelligence , from social sciences to biology , mathematics and physics .",
    "even though a unitarian view of language as a complex system is still lacking , a number of different approaches have been proposed in order to get major insights into some specific aspects such as , for instance , the self - organized processes leading to the emergence of a shared lexicon ( i.e. a communication system ) in a population of agents . in the past few years , it has been shown that simple models of interacting agents could display a collective agreement on a shared mapping between words and objects ( or meanings ) , eventually bootstrapping a shared system of linguistic conventions , even without global supervision or a priori common knowledge  @xcite .",
    "such models of `` language games '' , in which the organization of language is tackled at a purely semiotic level ( neglecting semantic relations between symbols and meanings ) , have played a pivotal role for the understanding of emergent communication systems .",
    "we will restrain ourselves to the case of the emergence and evolution of a communication system on short temporal scales compared to those involved in the evolution of language , so that we neglect any darwinian principle commonly used in the modelization of language evolution  @xcite , and focus on simple population dynamics . in this context ,",
    "a new field of research called semiotic dynamics has been recently developed , that investigates by means of simple models how ( linguistic ) conventions originate , spread and evolve over time in a population of agents endowed with basic internal states and able to perform local pairwise interactions  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental model of semiotic dynamics is the naming game  @xcite , that describes a population of agents trying to agree on the assignation of names to objects .",
    "the emergence of consensus about the object s name allows to establish a communication system .",
    "such model was inspired by global coordination problems in artificial intelligence and by peer - to - peer communication modeling .",
    "a practical example of this type of dynamics is provided by the talking heads experiment  @xcite , in which embodied software agents develop their vocabulary observing objects through digital cameras , assigning them randomly chosen names and sharing these names in pairwise interactions .",
    "very recently  @xcite , models of semiotic dynamics have as well found application in the study of a new generation of web - tools which enable human web - users to self - organize a system of tags in such a way to ensure a shared classification of information about different arguments ( see , for instance , del.icio.us or www.flickr.com ) .    statistical physics has been involved in the analysis of models of emergent collective behavior in interacting particles systems for a long time .",
    "it is therefore not a surprise that , recently , various contributions have come from physicists , in order to shed light on the dynamics of opinion formation through the study of models of social interactions  @xcite .",
    "the naming game ( ng ) , as a model of interacting agents reaching a global consensus through emergent cooperative phenomena , can as well be studied through the statistical physics toolbox that can give insights into the corresponding complex dynamics . as a first natural step ,",
    "previous studies have considered , as was the case in the talking heads experiments , that each agent was allowed to interact with all the others  @xcite .",
    "this mean - field like scenario can indeed be realistic when dealing with a small number of agents .",
    "moreover , the case of agents embedded into low - dimensional lattices has as well been investigated  @xcite , showing that the global behavior of the naming game strongly depends on the underlying topology .",
    "recently however , the growing field of complex networks  @xcite has allowed to obtain a better knowledge of social networks  @xcite , and in particular to show that the typical topology of the networks on which agents interact is not regular .",
    "the natural step taken in this paper is thus to consider the naming game for agents embedded on more realistic networks and to study the influence of various complex topologies on the corresponding dynamical behavior .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . section  [ sec2 ] and  [ sec3 ] are devoted to the definition of the model and to summarize already known results about the naming game dynamics in the case of mean - field and low dimensional lattices . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    ", we briefly recall the definition of network models subsequently used in the theoretical and numerical analysis , whose results are exposed in section  [ sec5 ] . conclusions and directions for future works are exposed in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "a minimal model of naming game has been put forward by baronchelli et al . in ref .  @xcite to reproduce the main features of semiotic dynamics and the fundamental results of adaptive coordination observed in the talking heads experiment  @xcite . in this minimal model ,",
    "@xmath0 identical agents observe a single object , for which they invent names that they try to communicate to one another through pairwise interactions .",
    "each agent is endowed with an internal inventory , in which it can store an a priori unlimited number of names ( or opinions ) .",
    "all agents start with empty inventories . at each time step , a pair of neighboring agents is chosen randomly , one playing as  speaker  the other as  hearer  , and a negotiation process takes place according to the following rules ( see also figure  [ fig:0 ] ) . the speaker transmits a name to the hearer .",
    "if its inventory is empty , a new word is invented , otherwise it selects randomly one of the names it knows .",
    "if the hearer has the uttered name in its inventory , the game is a success , and both agents delete all their words but the winning one .",
    "if the hearer does not know the uttered word , the game is a failure , and the hearer adds the word to its inventory , i.e. it learns it .",
    "note that the time unit is here given by one interaction , in contrast to most non - equilibrium statistical physics models in which a time unit corresponds to @xmath0 interactions . in many cases , results for the dynamical evolution will therefore be expressed as a function of the rescaled time @xmath2 .    although this model can be seen as belonging to the broad class of opinion formation models , it is interesting to notice the important differences with other commonly studied such models  @xcite",
    ". in particular , each agent can potentially be in an infinite number of possible discrete states ( or words , names ) , contrarily to the voter model in which each agent has only two possible states .",
    "moreover , an agent can here accumulate in its memory different possible names for the object , i.e. wait before reaching a decision , and has an a priori unlimited memory .",
    "an interesting question therefore relates to the actual memory size required by each agent during the dynamics .",
    "finally , each dynamical step can be seen as a negotiation between speaker and hearer , with a certain degree of stochasticity , while in the voter model , an agent deterministically adopts the opinion of one of its neighbors .",
    "another remark concerns the random extraction of the word to be uttered from the speaker s inventory .",
    "previously proposed models of semiotic dynamics used a more complicated representation of the negotiation interaction assigning weights to the words in the inventories . in such models ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the word with largest weight is automatically chosen by the speaker and communicated to the hearer .",
    "communicative success or failures are translated into updates of the weights : the weight of a word involved in a successful interaction is increased to the detriment of the other weights ( with no deletion process ) , while a failure leads to the decrease of the weight of the word not understood by the hearer .",
    "while such rules are certainly more realistic than the drastic deletion rule of the minimal naming game , the latter has been shown to retain the essential features of the emergence of a global collective behavior and corresponds to a much simpler definition .",
    "it is also worth noting that in the minimal naming game all agents refer to the same single object , while in the original experiments the embodied agents could observe a set of different objects .",
    "this is due to the assumption that homonymy is excluded , i.e. it is impossible that two distinct objects assume the same name .",
    "thus , in the model , all objects are independent and the general problem reduces to a set of uncorrelated systems , each one described by the minimal model .    in the rest of the paper",
    "all analysis and numerical simulations will deal with this simplified model that can be rightly seen as the prototype of the naming game .",
    "most previous studies in semiotic dynamics have focused on populations of agents in which all pairwise interactions are allowed , i.e. the agents are placed on the vertices of a fully - connected graph . in statistical mechanics ,",
    "this topological structure is commonly referred as ",
    "mean - field  topology . in the original work on the minimal naming game model  @xcite ,",
    "baronchelli et al . have studied numerically and analytically the behavior of the mean - field model , providing theoretical arguments in order to explain the main properties of the population s global behavior .",
    "the overall dynamics have been studied monitoring the temporal evolution of the total number @xmath3 of words in the system at time @xmath4 , i.e. the total memory used by the agents inventories , of the number of different words @xmath5 , and of the average success rate @xmath6 ( i.e. the probability , computed averaging on many simulation runs , that the interaction at time @xmath4 is successful ) . at the beginning , many disjoint pairs of agents interact , with empty initial inventories : they invent a large number of different words that then start spreading throughout the system , through unsuccessful interactions .",
    "indeed , in the early stages of the dynamics , the overlap between inventories is very low and successful interactions are limited to those pairs which have been chosen at least twice .",
    "since the number of possible partners of an agent is of order @xmath0 , an agent rarely interacts twice with the same partner : the probability of such an event grows only as @xmath7 .",
    "the consequence , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( black circles ) , is that in this phase the number of different words @xmath8 invented by the agents grows , reaching a maximum that scales as @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath8 then saturates ( no inventory is empty anymore so that no new words are invented ) and displays a plateau , while the total number @xmath10 of words keep growing since the various words propagate in the system and correlations grow between inventories .",
    "the peak of @xmath10 has been shown to scale as @xmath11  @xcite , which means that each agent stores @xmath12 words , and occurs after the system has evolved for a time @xmath13 .",
    "the strong correlations built during this time finally lead the system to consensus in a time @xmath14 of order @xmath15 .",
    "the final state corresponds to the agreement of the agents on the name to be assigned to a particular object : @xmath16 , which means that each agent possesses a unique word in its inventory , and @xmath17 , which shows that this word is the same for all agents .",
    "the s - shaped curve ( black circles ) of the success rate in fig .  [ fig:1 ] summarizes the dynamics : initially , agents hardly understand each other ( @xmath6 is very low ) ; the inventories start to present significant overlaps , so that @xmath6 increases until it reaches @xmath18 , and the communication system is completely set in .",
    "( top ) , of the number of different words @xmath8 ( middle ) , and of the average success rate @xmath6 ( bottom ) , for a mean - field system ( black circles ) and low dimensional lattices ( @xmath19 , red squares and @xmath20 , blue triangles ) with @xmath21 agents , averaged over @xmath22 realizations .",
    "the inset in the top graph shows the very slow convergence for low - dimensional systems.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    a first study of the effects of topological embedding on the naming game dynamics is reported in ref .",
    "when the interacting agents sit on the nodes of low - dimensional lattices , the long - time behavior is still characterized by the convergence to a homogeneous consensus state , but the evolution of the system changes considerably . since each agent can interact only with a limited number of neighbors ( @xmath23 in a @xmath24-dimensional lattice ) , at the local scale the dynamics is very fast : agents can rapidly interact two or more times with their neighbors , favoring the establishment of a local consensus with a high success rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , red squares for @xmath19 and blue triangles for @xmath20 ) , i.e. of small sets of neighboring agents sharing a common unique word .",
    "these  clusters  of neighboring agents with a common unique word are separated by individuals having a larger inventory with two or more words , playing the role of  interfaces  . for one - dimensional systems , it can be proved analytically  @xcite that the motion of interfaces is a random walk for which the diffusion coefficient can be computed .",
    "consequently , the clusters of unique words grow in time with a law that is typical of coarsening phenomena  @xcite , i.e. the competition among the clusters is driven by the fluctuations of the interfaces .",
    "the coarsening picture can be extended to higher dimensions , where it has been checked numerically .",
    "such an analysis shows that in low - dimensional structures local consensus is easy but in the long run delays the global consensus , which takes much longer to be reached than in mean - field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) : for example , @xmath25 in dimension @xmath18 vs. @xmath26 in mean - field .",
    "however , another important aspect of the problem concerns the memory used by the agents . in mean - field indeed , each agent needs a memory capacity scaling as @xmath27 , i.e. diverging with the system size .",
    "in contrast , the consequence of the embedding in a finite - dimensional lattice ( with finite number of neighbors ) , and of the subsequent coarsening like phenomena , with rapid local consensus , is that each agent uses only a finite capacity : the maximum total number of words in the system ( maximal memory capacity ) scales linearly with the system size @xmath0 ( as for the number of different words ) . in summary , _ low - dimensional lattice systems require more time to reach the consensus compared to mean - field , but a lower use of memory_.    social interactions however take place on networks that are neither mean - field like nor regular lattices , but share a certain number of properties such as the small - world property ( the average topological distance between nodes increases very slowly -logarithmically or even slower- with the number of nodes ) and the relative abundance of `` hubs '' ( nodes with very large degree compared to the mean of the degree distribution @xmath28 ) .",
    "more precisely , the degree distributions are in many cases heterogeneous , with heavy - tails often of a power - law ( or `` scale - free '' ) nature ( for a significant range of values of @xmath29 , one has @xmath30 )  @xcite .",
    "moreover , social networks are often characterized by a large transitivity , which implies that two neighbors of a given vertex are also connected to each other with large probability .",
    "transitivity can be quantitatively measured by means of the clustering coefficient @xmath31 of vertex @xmath32 @xcite , defined as the ratio between the number of edges @xmath33 existing between the @xmath34 neighbors of @xmath32 , and its maximum possible value , i.e. @xmath35 . the average clustering coefficient , defined as @xmath36 , usually takes quite large values in real complex networks .    in order to investigate to what extent these properties can affect the local and global dynamics of the naming game",
    ", we have performed extensive simulations of this model with agents embedded on the nodes of various paradigmatic computer - generated network models , whose definitions and main properties are recalled in the next section .",
    "while many models with various characteristics have been proposed in the last years in order to account for various detailed properties of real - world networks , our aim in this paper is to understand the influence on the dynamics of the naming game of the most salient properties such as heterogeneity in the degree distribution , clustering , average degree , and we will therefore concentrate on a few network models that have become indeed paradigms of complex networks .",
    "the prototype of homogeneous networks is the uncorrelated random graph model proposed by erds and rnyi ( er model )  @xcite , whose construction consists in drawing an ( undirected ) edge with a fixed probability @xmath37 between each possible pair out of @xmath0 given vertices .",
    "the resulting graph shows a binomial degree distribution with average @xmath38 , converging to a poissonian distribution for large @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath37 is sufficiently small ( order @xmath39 ) , the graph is sparse and presents locally tree - like structures .    in order to account for degree heterogeneity",
    ", other constructions have been proposed for random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will consider the uncorrelated configuration ( uc ) model which yields uncorrelated random graphs through the following construction : @xmath0 vertices with a fixed degree sequence taken from the desired degree distribution , with a cut - off @xmath40 , are connected randomly avoiding multi - links and self - links .    since many real networks are not static but evolving , with new nodes entering and establishing connections to already existing nodes , many models of growing networks have also been introduced .",
    "we will consider the model introduced by barabsi and albert ( ba )  @xcite , which has become one of the most famous models for complex heterogeneous networks , and is constructed as follows : starting from a small set of @xmath41 interconnected nodes , new nodes are introduced one by one .",
    "each new node selects @xmath41 older nodes according to the _ preferential attachment _ rule , i.e. with probability proportional to their degree , and creates links with them .",
    "the procedure stops when the required network size @xmath0 is reached .",
    "the obtained network has average degree @xmath42 , small clustering ( of order @xmath39 ) and a power - law degree distribution @xmath30 , with @xmath43 .",
    "the ba networks have small clustering , in contrast with social networks .",
    "it turns out that growing networks can as well be constructed with a large clustering . in ref .",
    "@xcite indeed , dorogovtsev et al .",
    "have proposed a model ( dms model ) in which each new node connects with the two extremities of a randomly chosen edge , forming therefore a triangle .",
    "since the number of edges arriving to any node is in fact its degree , the probability of attaching the new node to an old node is proportional to its degree and the preferential attachment is recovered .",
    "the degree distribution is therefore the same as the one of a ba model with @xmath44 , and the degree - degree correlations are as well equal .",
    "however , the clustering coefficient is large and approximately equal to @xmath45  @xcite . in order to tune the clustering",
    ", we can consider a generalization of this construction , in the spirit of the holme - kim model  @xcite : starting from @xmath41 connected nodes ( with @xmath41 even ) , a new node is added at each time step ; with probability @xmath46 it is connected to @xmath41 nodes chosen with the preferential attachment rule ( ba step ) , and with probability @xmath47 it is connected to the extremities of @xmath48 edges chosen at random ( dms - like step ) .",
    "the one - node and two - node properties ( i.e. degree distribution and degree - degree correlations ) are the same as the ones of the ba network , while the clustering spectrum , i.e. the average clustering coefficient of nodes of degree @xmath29 , can be computed as @xmath49+{\\cal o}(1/n)$ ]  @xcite : changing @xmath41 and @xmath46 allow to tune the value of the clustering coefficient .",
    "since the er model also displays a low clustering , we consider moreover a purposedly modified version of this random graph model ( clustered er , or cer model ) with tunable clustering . given @xmath0 nodes , each pair of nodes is considered with probability @xmath37 ; the two nodes are then linked with probability @xmath50 while , with probability @xmath51 , a third node ( which is not already linked with either ) is chosen and a triangle is formed .",
    "the clustering is thus proportional to @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 we can neglect the original clustering of the er network ) while the average degree is approximately given by @xmath53 pn \\simeq ( 2q+1)pn$ ] .",
    ", we therefore tune @xmath37 for the construction of the corresponding cer . ]",
    "the next section contains the results of simulations of the minimal naming game with agents embedded on er and ba networks .",
    "our simulations have been carried out on networks of sizes ranging from @xmath22 to @xmath54 nodes , with results averaged over @xmath55 runs per network realization and over @xmath55 network realizations . since the ba model has some particular hierarchical structure due to its growing construction , we have compared the corresponding results with the case of networks created with the uc model , in which the exponent of the degree distribution can moreover be varied .",
    "it turns out that the obtained behavior is very similar , so that we will display results for the ba model .",
    "the effect of clustering will be discussed using the mixed ba - dms and the cer network models .",
    "in this section we expose the main results on the dynamics of the naming game on complex networks . before entering into the details of the analysis ,",
    "it is worth noting that the minimal naming game model itself , as described in section  [ sec2 ] , is not well - defined on general networks .",
    "indeed , the two neighboring agents chosen to interact have different roles : one ( the speaker ) transmits a word and is thus more `` active '' than the other ( the hearer ) .",
    "one should therefore specify whether , when choosing a pair , one chooses first a speaker and then a hearer among the speaker s neighbors , or the reverse order . if the agents sit on either a fully connected graph or on a regular lattice , they have an equivalent neighborhood so the order is not important . on a generic network with degree distribution @xmath28 however , the degree of the first chosen node and of its chosen neighbor are distributed respectively according to @xmath28 and to @xmath56 .",
    "the second node will therefore have typically a larger degree , and the asymmetry between speaker and hearer can couple to the asymmetry between a randomly chosen node and its randomly chosen neighbor , leading to different dynamical properties ( this is the case for example in the voter model , as studied by castellano  @xcite ) .",
    "this is particularly relevant in heterogeneous networks for which a neighbor of a randomly chosen node is a hub with relatively large probability .",
    "we therefore can distinguish more possibilities for the definition of the naming game on generic networks .",
    "( top ) and number of different words @xmath8 ( bottom ) vs. rescaled time for two different strategies of pair selection on a ba network of @xmath57 agents , with @xmath58 .",
    "the reverse ng rule ( black full line ) converges much faster than the direct rule ( red dashed line ) .",
    "nonetheless , the two strategies lead to the same scaling laws with the system size for the convergence time ( not shown).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    * \\(i ) a randomly chosen speaker selects ( again randomly ) a hearer among its neighbors .",
    "this is probably the most natural generalization of the original rule .",
    "we call this strategy _ direct naming game_. in this case , larger degree nodes will preferentially act as hearers . * \\(ii ) the opposite strategy , here called _ reverse naming game _",
    ", can also be carried out : we choose the hearer at random and one of its neighbors as speaker . in this case the hubs are preferentially selected as speakers . *",
    "\\(iii ) a _ neutral _ strategy to pick up pairs of nodes is that of considering the extremities of an edge taken uniformly at random . the role of speaker and hearer",
    "are then assigned randomly with equal probability among the two nodes .",

    "the mean - field ( mf ) case is also shown ( for @xmath63 ) for comparison . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure  [ fig:2 ] allows to compare the evolution of the direct and the reverse naming game for a ba network of @xmath57 agents and @xmath64 . in the case of the reverse rule ,",
    "a larger memory is used although the number of different words created is smaller , and a faster convergence is obtained .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the hubs , playing principally as speakers , can spread their words to a larger fraction of the agents , and remain more stable than when playing as hearers , enhancing the possibility of convergence .",
    "depending on the network under study , and similarly to the voter model case  @xcite , the scaling laws of the convergence time can even be modified , as our preliminary study shows .",
    "a detailed analysis of this behavior remains however beyond the scope of our present study and we leave it for future work ( see also  @xcite ) . from the point of view of a realistic interaction among individuals or computer - based agents , the direct naming game in which the speaker chooses a hearer among its neighbors seems somehow more natural than the other ones . in the remainder of this paper",
    "therefore , we will focus on the direct naming game , mentioning where necessary the corresponding behavior for the other two rules .     for the time of the memory peak ( @xmath65 ) and the convergence time ( @xmath14 ) for er random graphs ( left ) and ba scale - free networks ( right ) with average degree @xmath66 . in both cases ,",

    "here we use some other mechanisms to enhance clustering , summarized in the following two models that have been defined in section  [ sec4 ] : clustered erds - rnyi ( cer ) random graphs , and mixed ba - dms model .",
    "figure  [ fig:16 ] shows the effect of increasing the clustering at fixed average degree and degree distributions : the number of different words is not changed , but the average memory used is smaller and the convergence takes more time .",
    "moreover , the memory peak at fixed @xmath29 is smaller for larger clustering ( not shown ) : it is more probable for a node to speak to @xmath98 neighbors that share common words because they are themselves connected and have already interacted , so that it is less probable to learn new words . favored by the larger number of triangles , cliques of neighboring nodes learn from the start the same word , causing a slight increase in the fraction of nodes with only one word as reported in fig .  [ fig:17 ] for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks .",
    "at fixed average degree i.e. global number of links , less connections are moreover available to transmit words from one part of the network to the other since many links are used in `` local '' triangles .",

    "this ensures that every part of the network is rapidly reachable from any other part , in contrast to what happens with regular lattices .",
    "such property therefore generically enhances the possibility of creating correlations between the inventories of the agents and of finally converging to a consensus . in this subsection , we show that this line of reasoning bears , surprisingly at first sight , some exceptions .    the first ( and easiest to apprehend ) exception is given by the scale - free trees , obtained by the preferential attachment procedure with @xmath144 . in this case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:18 ] , the convergence is reached very slowly , with @xmath145 decreasing as a power law of the time .",
    "this is in contrast with the generic behavior , i.e. a plateau followed by an exponential convergence , as shown also for reference in fig .",
    "[ fig:18 ] , but similar to the finite - dimensional lattices ( the average cluster size as well grows as a power - law , in contrast with the data of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of what happens for the voter model @xcite , in which a power - law instead of exponential decrease of the fraction of active bonds is observed , and can be understood through the tree structure of the network .",
    "indeed , from the viewpoint of the dynamics , a tree is formed by two ingredients : linear structures on which the interfaces between clusters diffuse as in one - dimensional systems and branching points at which interfaces may be pinned and their motion slowed . in fact , we have checked that similar ( slow ) power - law behaviors are also obtained for the naming game on cayley tree ( i.e. in which every node has the same degree ) or for scale - free tree with different degree distributions ( obtained through the generalized linear preferential attachment model ) .",
    "the slowness of this dynamical behavior is however rooted in a slightly more subtle consideration . as fig .",
    "[ fig:18 ] indeed shows , the naming game displays power - law convergence in other heterogeneous networks that are not at all tree - like , such as the dms model with @xmath44  @xcite , in which at each step a triangle is created , the deterministic scale - free networks of barabsi , ravasz and vicsek ( brv )  @xcite or the apollonian and random apollonian networks ( ran )  @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall how these networks are constructed :    * for the dms model with @xmath44 , one adds at each step a new node which is connected to the extremities of a randomly chosen edge .",
    "* for the deterministic scale - free brv networks , one starts ( step @xmath18 ) with two nodes connected to a root . at each step @xmath146 , two units ( of @xmath147nodes ) identical to the network formed at the previous step are added , and each of the bottom @xmath148 nodes are connected to the root . *",
    "the random apollonian networks are embedded in a two - dimensional plane .",
    "one starts with a triangle ; a node is added in the middle of the triangle and connected to the three previous nodes ; at each step , a new node is added in one of the existing triangles ( chosen at random ) and connected to its three corners , replacing the chosen triangle by three new smaller triangles .",
    "all these networks share a very important and hard to quantify property : they are hierarchically built .",
    "this is particularly clear for the brv case , since at each step the new network is formed by three identical sub - networks . in the ran as well , hierarchically nested units can be identified with the triangles , each of which contains other smaller triangles .",
    "finally , in the dms case , one can identify a unit at a certain scale as an edge and the set of nodes that have been attached to the extremities of this edge or of the edges subsequently created in this unit .",
    "because of these particular network organizations , each node belongs in fact to a given sub - hierarchical unit and , to go from one node to another node in another sub - unit , a hierarchical path has to be followed .",
    "the trees represent a particular class of such structures , in which there exist only one path between two given nodes . in this sense , such networks , although being small - world , present a structure which renders communication between different parts of the network more difficult",
    ". each sub - unit can therefore converge towards a local consensus which renders the global consensus more cumbersome to achieve .",
    "such results show that the small - world property in fact does not by itself guarantee an efficient convergence of dynamical processes such as the naming game , and that strongly hierarchical structures in fact slow down and obstruct such convergence .",
    "in this article , we have studied the dynamical properties of the minimal naming game model  @xcite in populations of agents interacting on complex topologies , focusing on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks ( represented respectively by the erds - rnyi random graph model and by the barabsi - albert scale - free model ) .",
    "social networks indeed are typically neither fully connected graphs nor regular lattices .",
    "we have considered the effects of various networks characteristics such as the heterogeneity , the average degree and the presence of clustering .",
    "the main characteristic of the studied networks is the small - world property ( the average hopping distance between two nodes scales only logarithmically with the size of the network ) .",
    "after an initial phase during which words are created , the small - world property ensures their propagation out of the local scale , boosting up the spreading process contrarily to what happens in low dimensional lattices where words spreading is purely diffusive ( see sections  [ sec5a]-[sec5b ] ) . as already suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , we argue that the small - world property allows to inhomogeneous and sparse networks to recover the high temporal efficiency observed in the mean - field system . for both the",
    "er and ba network models we get a scaling law for the convergence time @xmath14 with the size @xmath0 of the system of the type @xmath149 , with exponent approximately @xmath150 .",
    "the discrepancy with the mean - field exponent ( @xmath151 ) may be due to logarithmic corrections that are unlikely to be captured using numerical scaling techniques .",
    "moreover , small - world networks have higher memory efficiency than the mean - field model , since the peak in the total number of words scales only linearly with the size @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the fact that these networks are _ sparse _ , i.e. their average degree @xmath75 is small compared to @xmath0 .",
    "the detailed analysis of the naming game dynamics shows distinct activity patterns on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks . in homogeneous networks",
    "all nodes have a similar neighborhood and therefore similar dynamical evolution , while in heterogeneous networks classes of nodes with different degree play different roles in the evolution of the game .",
    "the role of the hubs is better understood thanks to the degree based analysis of the number of words and different words .",
    "high degree nodes , indeed , are more likely chosen as hearers and , consequently , they have larger inventory sizes . at the beginning , because of the pair choosing strategy ( direct naming game ) , low degree nodes are much more involved in the process of word generation than the hubs . local consensus is easily reached and a large amount of locally stable different words get in touch with higher degree nodes .",
    "the latter start to accumulate a large number of words in their inventories , playing as spreaders of names towards less connected agents and finally driving the convergence . from this viewpoint",
    ", the convergence dynamical pattern of the naming game on heterogeneous complex networks presents some similarities with more studied epidemic spreading phenomena  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed comparison of the activity pattern for the direct and reverse naming game is left for future work  @xcite .",
    "the relation between topological properties and dynamical evolution of the system are further characterized by a detailed study of the effects of varying the average degree and clustering coefficient .",
    "these effects are equivalent on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks . while any increase of the average degree provokes a larger memory peak and a faster convergence , the growth of clustering coefficient leads to the decrease of the necessary memory but the fast obtention of local consensus delays in the long run the global convergence .",
    "the latter effect is particularly relevant for real social networks in which local cohesiveness is an important feature that can not be neglected .",
    "another important ingredient of real networks that we have not addressed here is the presence of degree correlations in the network topology .",
    "it would indeed be interesting to know in what measure positive or negative degree correlations affect the negotiating processes of the agents .    in summary , as other models of opinion formation  @xcite , the naming game shows a non - equilibrium dynamical evolution from a disordered state to a state of global agreement .",
    "however , with respect to most opinion models , in which the agents may accept or refuse to conform to the opinion of someone else , the naming game gives more importance to the bilateral negotiation process between pairs of agents that is a cornerstone in the evolutionist theory of language  @xcite .",
    "for this reason the naming game should be regarded as an independent attempt to model the ultimate emergence of a globally accepted linguistic convention or , in other terms , the establishment of a self - organized communication system .",
    "in contrast with other non - equilibrium models , as those based on zero - temperature glauber dynamics or the voter model  @xcite , we do not find any signature of the occurrence of metastable blocked states in any relevant topology with quenched disorder . while the total number of words displays a plateau whose length increases with the system size during the re - organization phase , indeed , the number of different words is continuously decreasing , revealing that the convergence is not a matter of fluctuations due to finite - size effects , but the result of an evolving self - organizing process .",
    "such behavior makes the naming game a robust model of self - coordinated communication in any structured population of agents . a noticeable exception concerns the case of agents sitting on networks with strong community structures , i.e. networks composed of a certain number of internally highly connected groups interconnected by few links working as bridges .",
    "figure  [ fig:19 ] reports the behavior of the naming game on such a network , composed of fully - connected cliques , each of @xmath152 nodes , the various cliques being connected to each other with only one link . from simulations it turns out that",
    ", not only the total number of words , but even the number of different words display a plateau whose duration increases with the size of the system .",
    "the number of different words in the plateau equals the number of communities , while the corresponding total number of words per node is about one , proving the existence of a real metastable state in which the system reaches a long - lasting multi - vocabulary configuration .",
    "indeed , each community reaches internal consensus but the weak connections between communities are not sufficient for words to propagate from one community to the other .",
    "nodes so that there are @xmath153 communities . the dashed ellipse and the arrow",
    "identify the metastable states with @xmath154 different words.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in conclusion , populations of agents with fixed complex topology do evolve towards a homogeneous state of consensus and efficient communication , except for somehow artificial network structures , the detailed topological properties affecting only the convergence pattern and time scale .",
    "future work will address the important issue of a possible interplay between topology and dynamics in populations in which the agents are free of rearranging their connectivity patterns in relation to local ( or global ) information on the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "it would for example be interesting to verify if such interplay may allow for a natural emergence of community structures and multi - language cohabitation .",
