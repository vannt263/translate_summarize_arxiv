    "the generated photons are analyzed using adjustable qwp , hwp and a polarizer @xcite .",

    "the detectors are home - made single photon counting modules ( spcm ) , based on an avalanche photodiode operated in geiger mode with active quenching . for the coincidence",
    "counting we use a tac / sca .",
    "the nonlinear crystals are properly cut to generate photons into a cone of half - opening angle @xmath2 with respect to pump .",
    "the first crystal converts horizontally polarized pump photons into vertically polarized ( @xmath3 ) signal and idler photons , while the second crystal converts vertically polarized pump photons into horizontally polarized ( @xmath4 ) signal and idler photons . this configuration introduces a delay time @xmath5 , depending on the crystal length , between the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 part of the entangled state , as discussed in the following sections .",
    "the pair of photons generated by spdc of type i from a single nonlinear crystal , having wave vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are represented by state vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the signal and idler , respectively .",
    "the wavefunction appropriate to the system can be written as a superposition of these state vectors @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the spectral complex amplitude of the pump laser , which is a function of the pump frequency @xmath12 , assuming as usual the validity of the energy conservation in the generation process , and it is centered around the reference frequency @xmath13 .",
    "the factors @xmath14 and @xmath15 are mismatch functions depending on the variation of the transverse and longitudinal part of the pump wave vector with respect to the reference of momentum conservation , and are described in detail in the following .",
    "the function @xmath16 comes from a spatial integration over all the possible processes of photon generation within the pump transverse profile in the crystal , taking the first order approximation of the nonlinear interaction . for a gaussian pump profile",

    "[ angoli ] , one has @xmath19 with the internal generation angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 for signal and idler , respectively . in our case",

    "a similar consideration can be done over the dependence of @xmath15 over the internal angle @xmath20 ; being the experimental configuration highly collinear , the optical couplers are practically insensible to its variation ( within the acceptance cone )",
    ". therefore we can substitute @xmath20 with the fixed reference angle @xmath34 , and the mismatch function becomes : @xmath35 the wavefunction of the photon pair can now be written in the simpler form : @xmath36    in the first approximation we can solve for the integral over the internal generation angle @xmath20 because neither @xmath37 nor @xmath15 depend on it , but a more refined reasoning put forward the fact that the conservation of the transverse wave vector introduces a limitation in the effective spectral width of the mismatch function , hence affecting the integration over @xmath38 .",
    "this happens because by varying @xmath38 around the down  converted reference @xmath39 , the idler angle @xmath21 may go outside from the optical coupler acceptance limit , as verified by means of the experimental data discussed in appendix  a. this problem does not affect the integral over @xmath32 for the smallness of the pump spectral width . to take care of this spectral limitation",

    "this light is characterized by a ( real ) constant amplitude @xmath73 and a rapidly varying phase with a characteristic time equal to the coherence time of the pump @xmath1 .",
