    "the fermion electric dipole moments ( edms ) provide considerable information about the cp violation since they are driven by the cp violating interactions . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",

    "for the lepton sector , the possible lepton mixing matrix is the candidate for non vanishing cp violation .",
    "however , their negligibly small theoretical values stimulate one to search new models beyond the sm and one can obtain relatively greater edms with the extension of the particle spectrum , such as multi higgs doublet models ( mhdm ) , supersymmetric model ( susy ) , @xcite , ... , etc .. among fermion edms , the charged lepton edms are worthwhile to study since they are clean theoretically . in the literature ,",
    "there exist various experimental and theoretical work on the charged lepton edms .",

    "recently , the charged lepton edms have been estimated in the split fermion scenario @xcite and the effect of the localization of the new higgs doublet in the split fermion scenario has been analyzed in @xcite . in these theoretical works ,",
    "some of the possible models and the additional effects due to the extension of the space - time have been studied to check the possible enhancement in the numerical values of the edms .",
    "in addition to the charged lepton edms the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions are rich from the theoretical point of view since they also exist at least at the loop level and make it possible to search the free parameters of the models used . in the sm , their branching ratios ( brs ) are much below the experimental limits since their existence depends on the neutrino mixing with non zero neutrino masses and , therefore , it is worthwhile to study them in the models beyond the sm .",
    "the improvement of the experimental measurements of the lfv processes make it possible to understand the new physics effects more accurately .",
    "one of the candidate model beyond the sm is the 2hdm , where the lfv interactions are induced by the internal neutral higgs bosons @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "similarly , the lepton flavor violation depends on these vertices and the necessary loop diagrams contain internal neutral higgs bosons @xmath5 and @xmath6 . furthermore , we extend the space - time with the additional two spatial dimensions and we consider that the new higgs doublet feels one of the extra dimensions ( the sixth one ) with a gaussian profile , and the fermions feel the other extra dimension ( the fifth one ) , with uniform zero mode profile .",

    "if the extra dimensions are not felt by some fields in the theory , such type is called non - universal extra dimensions where there is no restriction to conserve the kk number at each vertex .",
    "this leads to the possibility of the tree level interaction of kk modes with the ordinary particles . in another scenario , so called the split fermion scenario , the fermions are assumed to locate at different points in the extra dimension with gaussian profiles and the hierarchy of fermion masses can be obtained from the overlaps of fermion wave functions @xcite-@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider two extra dimensions and assume that the new higgs doublet is accessible to one of the extra dimensions with a gaussian profile around origin and also around another point near to the origin .",

    "the brs of the radiative lfv decays in the split fermion scenario , with the assumption that the new higgs doublet is restricted to the 4d brane or to a part of the bulk in one and two extra dimensions , in the framework of the 2hdm has been studied . in @xcite",

    "furthermore , we observe that these physical quantities are strongly sensitive to the location of the new higgs doublet gaussian profiles in the sixth dimension .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present edms of the charged leptons and the brs of the radiative lfv decays in the 2hdm with the inclusion of two spatial extra dimensions .",

    "the fermion edm carries a valuable information about the existence of the cp violation since it emerges from the cp violating fermion - fermion - photon interaction .",
    "the possible source of cp the violation is the complex ckm matrix ( lepton mixing matrix ) elements for quarks ( for leptons ) , in the framework of the sm .",
    "however , their estimated numerical values are extremely small and this makes it interesting to investigate new complex phases by considering the physics beyond the sm .",
    "the extension of the higgs sector may bring additional complex phases with the assumption that the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) are permitted at tree level with new complex yukawa couplings .",

    "<S> we estimate the charged lepton electric dipole moments and the branching ratios of radiative lepton flavor violating decays in the framework of the two higgs doublet model with the inclusion two extra dimensions . here , we consider that the new higgs doublet is accessible to one of the extra dimensions with a gaussian profile and the fermions are accessible to the other extra dimension with uniform zero mode profile . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the numerical values of the physical quantities studied enhance with the additional effects due to the extra dimensions and they are sensitive to the new higgs localization . </S>"
