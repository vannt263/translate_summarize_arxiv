    "the discovery of `` ultra - faint '' dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies around the milky way has revolutionized our understanding of dwarf galaxies and their prevalence in the universe .",
    "these newly discovered satellites , with total absolute magnitudes fainter than @xmath8 , have all been found in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) via slight statistical over - densities of individual stars @xcite .",
    "these objects provide important clues to galaxy formation on the smallest scales @xcite and substantially alleviate the discrepancy between the observed mass function of milky way satellites and that predicted by standard lambda cold dark matter models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sg07 ) .",
    "@xcite note that the ultra - faint dsphs have high central dark matter densities and are good candidates for indirect dark matter detection via gamma - ray emission by particle annihilation .",
    "future wide - field surveys that improve on the sky coverage and photometric depth of the sdss are likely to discover many additional ultra - faint milky way satellites in the coming years @xcite .    while the total luminosities of the ultra - faint satellites are comparable to globular clusters , spectroscopic studies for the majority of the newly discovered objects firmly suggest that these objects are dark matter - dominated dwarf galaxies ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mass - to - light ratios for all the ultra - faint dsphs are @xmath9  m@xmath10/l@xmath10 , with several systems approaching 1000  m@xmath10/l@xmath10 , assuming mass - follows - light .",
    "@xcite loosened this constraint , confirming the high mass - to - light ratios and finding a tight anti - correlation between mass - to - light ratio and luminosity such that all the milky way dwarfs are consistent with having a common dark matter mass of @xmath11 within their central 300pc .",
    "a theoretical understanding of the physics that sets the mass - luminosity relation will provide insight into the formation of galaxies at the smallest scales .",
    "further evidence that the ultra - faint satellites are indeed galaxies comes from metallicity measurements .",
    "the ultra - faint satellites are the most metal - poor known stellar systems ( [ fe / h ] @xmath12 ) and show internal metallicity spreads up to 0.5  dex in several objects ( sg07 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to milky way globular clusters which are , on average , more metal - rich and show little to no internal metallicity spread ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in further contrast to globular clusters , the ultra - faint dwarfs also follow the luminosity - metallicity relationship established by brighter milky way dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , both the kinematics and composition of the ultra - faint satellites strongly argue that these objects are dark matter - dominated galaxies .",
    "the combined size and luminosity of the spectroscopically confirmed dsphs in the milky way are well separated from globular clusters : at a given luminosity dwarf galaxies have larger sizes and are thus less compact @xcite .",
    "however , the three faintest sdss discoveries , segue1 , willman  1 and bootes  ii , are all in a region that overlaps with globular clusters . studying these extreme systems",
    "should provide important insight to dsphs , and the difference between dwarfs and star clusters , at all luminosities .",
    "of these three objects , only willman  1 has published kinematics @xcite . because the systemic velocity of willman  1 is similar to that of the foreground milky way stars , possible contamination in the kinematic sample",
    "make it difficult to assess whether this object is a dwarf or globular cluster ( * ? ? ?",
    "* willman et al .  in prep ) . here",
    ", we present the first spectroscopic study of an even lower luminosity system , segue1 .",
    "the systemic velocity of segue1 is far removed from the milky way foreground and thus should be a cleaner object to study the properties of the least luminous ultra - faint systems .",
    "segue1 was discovered by @xcite as an over - density of resolved stars in the sdss located at ( @xmath13 = ( 10:07:03 , + 16:04:25 ) = @xmath14 ) . via isochrone",
    "fitting , these authors estimate a distance of @xmath15kpc and an absolute luminosity of @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite recently revised the luminosity of segue1 to @xmath17 using a more robust method to estimate flux in systems with small numbers of observable stars .",
    "while the possibility of tidal tails and/or tidal distortion of segue1 was found in the initial sdss analysis , deeper imaging and more thorough simulations suggest that these features can be explained via poisson scatter of the few bright stars in this system @xcite .",
    "segue1 has no detected gas content , with an observed hi gas mass limit of less than @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this limit is consistent with other dsphs around the milky way in which any gas has been presumably removed via ram pressure stripping or used up via tidally - induced star formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that segue1 is spatially superimposed on the leading arm of the sagittarius stream .",
    "because it has a similar luminosity and size as the most diffuse globular cluster , they proposed that segue1 is a globular cluster formerly associated with the sagittarius dsph .",
    "spectroscopy of member stars in segue1 is required to test this hypothesis and answer the crucial question of whether or not this intrinsically faint stellar system is truly a globular cluster ( i.e.  a stellar system with a single stellar population with no dark matter ) . here",
    ", we present keck / deimos multi - object spectroscopy for individual stars in the vicinity of segue1 , identifying 24  stars as members of segue1 .    this paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec_data ] we discuss target selection and data reduction for our keck / deimos spectroscopy . in  [ sec_kin ] we discuss the spectroscopic results including estimates of the velocity dispersion , mass , mass - to - light ratio and metallicity . in  [ sec_sgr ] , we examine the spatial and kinematic position of segue1 relative to the sagittarius stream . in  [ sec_gamma ] we note that segue1 may be a good target for indirect detection of dark matter .",
    "finally , in  [ sec_disc ] , we discuss segue1 in context of the milky way dsph population .    throughout the analysis",
    ", we use the photometric properties of segue1 as derived by @xcite of @xmath0 ( i.e.the 1@xmath19 magnitude limits are @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) and @xmath22pc .",
    "we also assume a fixed reddening to segue1 based on the @xcite value of e(b - v ) = 0.032  mag .",
    "we list these and other key parameters in table  1 .",
    "targets were selected for spectroscopy based on @xmath23 photometry of segue1 from the sdss dr6 public database @xcite .",
    "as discussed in sg07 , we set the target priorities to preferentially observe stars with a high likelihood of being segue1 members . using the theoretical isochrones of @xcite and @xcite , we chose targets whose color and apparent magnitudes minimize the distance from the best fitting segue1 isochrone .",
    "the highest priority targets were those located within 0.1  mag of the rgb tracks , or within 0.2  mag of the horizontal branch , with additional preference being given to brighter stars ( figure  [ fig_cmd ] ) .",
    "stars farther from any of the fiducial sequences were classified as lower priority targets .",
    "we designed the slitmask so as to maximize the number of high priority targets : a total of 59 targets were placed on the segue1 mask , 26 of which were in our highest priority category .",
    "slitmasks were created using the deimos dsimulator package in iraf .",
    "one multislit mask was observed for segue1 using the keck  ii 10-m telescope and the deimos spectrograph @xcite on the night of november 12 , 2007 .",
    "the mask was observed for a total of 5400  seconds through the 1200  line  mm@xmath2 grating covering a wavelength region @xmath24 .",
    "the spatial scale is @xmath25  per pixel , the spectral dispersion of this setup is @xmath26 , and the resulting spectral resolution is @xmath27 ( fwhm ) .",
    "slitlets were @xmath28 wide .",
    "the minimum slit length was @xmath29 to allow adequate sky subtraction ; the minimum spatial separation between slit ends was @xmath30 ( three pixels ) .",
    "spectra were reduced using a modified version of the spec2d software pipeline ( version  1.1.4 ) developed by the deep2 team at the university of california - berkeley for that survey .",
    "a detailed description of the two - dimensional reductions can be found in sg07 .",
    "the final one - dimensional spectra are rebinned into logarithmic wavelength bins with 15kms@xmath2  per pixel .",
    "radial velocities were measured by cross - correlating the observed science spectra with a set of high signal - to - noise stellar templates .",
    "the method is the same as that described in sg07 and briefly repeated here .",
    "stellar templates were observed with keck / deimos using the same setup as described in  [ subsec_redux ] and covering a wide range of stellar types ( f8 to m8 giants , subgiants and dwarf stars ) and metallicities ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath31 to @xmath32  dex ) .",
    "we calculate and apply a telluric correction to each science spectrum by cross correlating a hot stellar template with the night sky absorption lines following the method in @xcite .",
    "the telluric correction accounts for the velocity error due to mis - centering the star within the @xmath28 slit caused by small mask rotations or astrometric errors .",
    "we apply both a telluric and heliocentric correction to all velocities presented in this paper .",
    "the random component of the velocity error is calculated using a monte carlo bootstrap method .",
    "noise is added to each pixel in the one - dimensional science spectrum , we then recalculate the velocity and telluric correction for 500 noise realizations .",
    "the random error is defined as the square root of the variance in the recovered mean velocity in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the systematic contribution to the velocity error was determined by sg07 to be 2.2kms@xmath2  based on repeated independent measurements of individual stars .",
    "since we are using the same spectrograph setup and reduction methods , we assume the systematic error contribution is constant across the two runs .",
    "we add the random and systematic errors in quadrature to arrive at the final velocity error for each science measurement .",
    "radial velocities were successfully measured for 49 of 59 extracted spectra .",
    "the median velocity error of these 49 stars is 3.6kms@xmath2 similar to that of sg07 .",
    "the median velocity error of the 24 segue1 members ( see below ) is 5.2kms@xmath2  since these stars are fainter than the sample average .",
    "the majority of spectra for which we could not measure a redshift did not have sufficient signal - to - noise .",
    "the fitted velocities were visually inspected to ensure reliability .",
    "the resulting velocities and associated errors are listed in table  2 .",
    "in figure  [ fig_velocity ] , we identify segue1 as the over - density of stars with radial velocities near 206kms@xmath2 .",
    "we estimate possible foreground contribution below and then discuss our criteria for segue1 membership , which we base only on velocity .",
    "we expect minimal contamination from foreground milky way stars at the position and velocity of segue1 .",
    "segue1 lies at a galactocentric position of @xmath33 . according to the besancon starcount model of the milky way @xcite at this galactic position , the velocity distribution of milky way foreground stars peaks at a heliocentric velocity of 20kms@xmath2 .",
    "the besancon models include stellar contributions from the milky way thin and thick disk , spheroid and stellar halo . the kinematic distribution of foreground stars is roughly approximated by a gaussian with fhwm of 35kms@xmath2 , however the tails of the distribution extend to significantly positive and negative velocities .",
    "the percentage of milky way stars expected in the presumed velocity span of segue1 , between @xmath34kms@xmath2 , is 2.5% of the total distribution .",
    "thus , if we assume that all the stars with velocities less than 100kms@xmath2  are milky way foreground stars ( a total of 20 stars , see figure  [ fig_velocity ] ) , we predict less than one foreground star in the segue1 velocity range .",
    "as noted by @xcite , segue1 is superposed on the leading arm of the sagittarius stream , @xmath35 degrees away from the main body of the sagittarius dsph .",
    "thus , a second possible source of contamination in our segue1 sample are stars associated with the sagittarius stream . as discussed in  [ sec_sgr ] ,",
    "the predicted velocity of the leading stream at this position is @xmath36kms@xmath2 , very far from the radial velocity of segue1 . while both the trailing arm and possible older wraps of the sagittarius stream may be present at this position",
    ", both components would have much wider velocity distributions than segue1 .",
    "we conclude that there is no contamination from sagittarius stream stars in the segue1 velocity window .",
    "finally , there are four stars at higher velocities ( @xmath37kms@xmath2 ) that do not appear to be associated with segue1 as a result of the 100kms@xmath2  velocity difference which we discuss in  [ ssec_highv ] .    since the expected contamination from both foreground milky way stars and the sagittarius stream is low in the velocity region of segue1 ,",
    "our criteria for segue1 membership is simple : we assign membership based only on velocity",
    ". stars with radial velocities between @xmath38kms@xmath2  are considered members of segue1 .",
    "this cut provides 24  member stars .",
    "the nearest non - members in our spectroscopic sample are at @xmath39kms@xmath2  and @xmath40kms@xmath2 , so different velocity cuts would identify the same set of members .",
    "the color - magnitude distribution of kinematically - selected segue1 members is shown in figure  [ fig_cmd ] .",
    "we plot fiducial sequences for the globular clusters ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath21 ) and ( [ fe / h]=@xmath41 ) .",
    "these ridgelines are based on those of @xcite in @xmath42 , converted to @xmath43 using the transformations of @xcite and shifted to the distance of segue1 ( 23kpc ) .",
    "these fiducials are well - matched to the kinematic sample .",
    "in particular , the spectra of the two bright blue stars ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) show strong broad absorption lines of the paschen series and narrow ca ii triplet lines consistent with being horizontal branch stars .",
    "the position of these two stars is also well matched to the metal - poor horizontal branch isochrones at the distance of segue1 .",
    "we measure the mean velocity and velocity dispersion of segue1 using the maximum - likelihood method described by @xcite .",
    "this method assumes that the observed velocity dispersion is the sum of the intrinsic galaxy dispersion and the dispersion produced by measurement errors .",
    "fitting the full segue1 sample based on the 24member stars identified above , we find a mean heliocentric velocity of @xmath46kms@xmath2  and a velocity dispersion of @xmath47kms@xmath2(figure  [ fig_velocity ] ) .",
    "we do not find evidence for rotation in this system , however , given the small numbers of stars we can not rule out rotation velocities on the same order as the velocity dispersion .",
    "we test this by adding a sinusoidal term to the systemic velocity , varying the amplitude and scale radius @xcite .",
    "the most likely value for the rotation amplitude is zero , with an upper 1-@xmath19 limit of 5kms@xmath2 . while this test justifies the mass modeling we use with no streaming motion in the velocities , larger kinematic data sets and smaller velocity uncertainties are necessary to test more conclusively for streaming motion segue1 .",
    "the grey shaded region in right panel of figure  [ fig_velocity ] indicates the @xmath48 width of the segue1 velocity distribution .",
    "we note that all the member stars lie within @xmath49 of the systemic segue1 velocity .",
    "the next nearest star in velocity space is over @xmath50 away .",
    "we interpret this cold distribution as evidence that there are no stars _ currently _ in the process of being tidally stripped from segue1 @xcite .",
    "we note here and in  [ ssec_tides ] , however , that the lack of outliers is not sufficient to prove that tidal processes are not affecting our results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this interpretation also does not mean that stars have not been previously stripped from segue1 , and still allows for the possibility that tidal interactions are currently on - going in the dark matter component of this object .",
    "we discuss this further in  [ ssec_tides ] .",
    "we calculate the dynamical mass of segue1 using two different methods . in both cases , we assume that segue  1 is a relaxed , self - gravitating , spherically - symmetric system with no rotational motion .",
    "we presently ignore any effects on the mass estimates due to tidal interactions between segue1 and the milky way , leaving that discussion to  [ ssec_tides ] .",
    "we first assume the simplest possible configuration : an isotropic sphere in which mass - follows - light .",
    "further assuming that the density is described as a king model and is in virial equilibrium , @xcite showed that the total mass is then @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a parameter that depends on the concentration of the system and is generally assumed to be 8 for dsphs @xcite , @xmath53 is the @xcite profile core radius , and @xmath19 is the observed average velocity dispersion .",
    "we convert the measured half - light radius of segue1 to king core radius as @xmath54pc . using this method",
    ", we estimate the total mass of segue1 to be @xmath55 .",
    "our second method to calculate the mass loosens the constraint that mass - follows - light and uses the individual stellar velocity measurements ( in contrast to the velocity dispersion averaged over the projected radius as above ) .",
    "the method is described in strigari et al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "similar to the mass - follows - light method , this model assumes spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium , i.e.  that the kinematic tracer population is related to the mass distribution via the jeans equation .",
    "we assume that the light profile follows the observed plummer profile with effective radius @xmath56pc , and that the dark matter follows a five - parameter density profile characterized by a scale density , a scale radius , an asymptotic inner slope , an asymptotic outer slope , and a parameter governing the transition between these two slopes .",
    "the dark matter density profile allows for both flat central density cores and steep central density cusps , including the cdm - favored nfw - like @xmath57 central cusps .",
    "we also allow for a radially - varying stellar velocity anisotropy profile .",
    "we then marginalize over these five free parameters , and can estimate the mass at any given radius .",
    "though the data do not constrain any of these parameters separately , the total dynamical mass within the stellar extent of 50pc is relatively well - constrained . using this model , we find the mass within 50pc to be @xmath58m@xmath59 .",
    "we note that the likelihood distribution of this quantity , shown in figure  [ fig_maxlike ] , is nearly log - normal ; the mass is greater than @xmath60with 3-@xmath19 confidence . in comparison ,",
    "the total stellar mass is merely 340 .",
    "the two masses calculated above agree within errors . in the mass - follows - light method",
    ", the majority of dark matter mass in the galaxy resides within the stellar radius , while the second method leaves open the possibility that the majority of the mass lies _ outside _ the observed light distribution .",
    "however , determining the total galaxy mass requires knowledge of the total radial extent of the dark matter halo and the profile shape beyond the last observed point .",
    "this is clearly difficult to determine observationally and strongly depends on the unknown orbital history of the galaxy .",
    "we can only estimate the instantaneous tidal radius of the galaxy , which ranges from a few ten to a few hundred parsecs depending on assumptions detailed in ",
    "[ sssec_tides ] . if the tidal radius is large , then it is plausible that the majority of mass lies outside the stellar distribution .    extrapolating the second estimate of mass to a radius of 300pc",
    ", we find a total dynamical mass of @xmath61 m@xmath59 , which , remarkably , is consistent with the common mass scale of all milky way dsphs as seen in figure  [ fig_corr ] @xcite .",
    "this common mass scale has been noted in previous studies @xcite ; we discuss this further in ",
    "[ sec_disc ] .",
    "if the stellar component of segue1 is embedded in a @xmath61  dark matter halo , we would expect the luminous component to have experienced very little tidal disruption despite its current proximity to the galaxy .",
    "regardless of which estimator is used above , the observed mass of segue1 is _ significantly _ larger than expected if all its mass were due to a stellar - only component .",
    "since segue1 contains little to no hi gas @xcite , the stellar mass likely dominates the total baryonic mass . in the absence of non - baryonic dark matter",
    ", we expect the mass - to - light ratio of segue1 to be @xmath62 , accounting for stellar remnants in an old stellar population @xcite . assuming this mass - to - light ratio , the stellar mass of segue1 is @xmath63 , translating into an expected velocity dispersion of merely @xmath64kms@xmath2 .",
    "this is more than 3-@xmath19 below the measured dispersion of segue1 and thus argues strongly for the presence of dark matter .",
    "finally , we calculate the @xmath65-band mass - to - light ( @xmath66 ) ratio within the observed radius . combining the absolute luminosity of segue1 ( @xmath0 ) with the mass from the first method above ( assuming mass - follows - light )",
    ", we calculate a mass - to - light ratio of ln@xmath5 ( @xmath67 ) , and in the second two - component method we calculate ln@xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the error distribution is asymmetric and the mass - to - light ratio is well in excess of that predicted from the stellar mass alone .",
    "the two - component model ratios suggests a dark matter - dominated galaxy with a 6@xmath70 significance .",
    "if the luminous components of dsphs do indeed reside in common mass dark matter halos , we would predict the highest m / l ratios in the least luminous dsphs ( see middle panel figure  [ fig_corr ] ) . since segue1 is the least luminous of the recently discovered ultra - faint milky way satellites , this remarkably high",
    "m / l is expected in this model .",
    "understanding the processes that lead to this high m / l will be a future challenge to galaxy formation models .",
    "the remarkably high mass - to - light ratio of segue1 rests on our interpretation that the measured stellar velocities faithfully trace the gravitational potential .",
    "here we discuss two possibilities that might affect this assumption .",
    "first is the presence of unresolved binary stars inflating our measured velocity dispersion .",
    "the second is tidal interactions with the milky way affecting the kinematics .",
    "both issues are difficult to quantify without further observations , but are worthwhile considering here .",
    "if a high percentage of our segue1 stellar members are in fact unresolved binary star systems , the measured velocity dispersion may be inflated due to their orbital motion .",
    "the severity of this effect depends on the mass ratio of individual systems , with equal mass binaries contributing most to the velocity bias .",
    "the likely presence of binaries in our kinematics sample is difficult to estimate empirically without repeated velocity measurements .",
    "@xcite simulate the effects of binaries on the velocity dispersions of dsph with datasets somewhat similar to that of segue1 . assuming a solar neighborhood binary fraction , they suggest that the velocity dispersion due to binaries alone is on the order @xmath71kms@xmath2 . thus ,",
    "while the overall dispersion may be inflated by binaries , they can not explain away the strong evidence of dark matter . because the true binary fraction in segue1 may be very different than that of the solar neighborhood",
    ", we do not fold this systematic error into our mass estimates .",
    "additional observations and improved simulations will allow us to better quantify the effects of binaries on our results .",
    "it is likely that segue1 has been affected by tidal interactions with the galaxy .",
    "segue1 lies at a distance of 23kpc from the sun , or d@xmath72kpc from the galactic center ( gc ) assuming a gc - sun distance of 8.5kpc .",
    "we estimate the instantaneous tidal radius for segue1 by first approximating both the milky way and segue1 as point masses .",
    "we assume a enclosed milky way mass of @xmath73 , corresponding to a circular velocity of 210kms@xmath2  at 28kpc .",
    "this is consistent with the milky way model used in  [ sec_sgr ] and @xcite . using the first estimate for the mass of segue1 in ",
    "[ ssec_mass ] , we determine a tidal radius of @xmath74pc . assuming that segue1 is embedded in an extended dark matter halo ( using mass from the second method above at 300pc ) , the tidal radius increases to @xmath75pc . in the first case , the luminous matter extends beyond the tidal radius and we would expect to see evidence for unbound stars in our kinematic sample , in the second case we would expect our observations to be well within the bound radius .",
    "however , this calculation does not account for the fact that segue1 is orbiting the milky way .",
    "when calculating the tidal radius in the reference frame of the mw - segue1 system , stars in segue1 will also feel centrifugal and coriolis forces in this rotating reference frame .",
    "if we include these forces , the tidal radius ( also called the jacobi or roche radius , binney & tremaine ( 2008 ) , eqn.8.91 ) is then @xmath76 .",
    "the tidal radius then increase to 220 and 615pc for the first and second cases , respectively .",
    "these are of course estimates of the _ instantaneous _ tidal radius : if segue1 is on an elliptical orbit the tidal radius may have been much different in the past .",
    "if some , or all , of the stars associated with segue1 are tidally disrupting ( unbound ) , then the measured velocities likely provide an inflated estimate of the mass @xcite . in the extreme case",
    "that segue1 is completely unbound , its mass could be as low as the stellar component alone ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "however , the fact that the luminosity profile of segue1 is centrally concentrated suggests that this object is not completely unbound .",
    "the crossing time of segue1 ( assuming @xmath78pc and a velocity dispersion of 4.3kms@xmath2 ) is @xmath61years .",
    "the travel time along the orbit of segue1 in @xmath61 years is roughly 2kpc assuming a circular orbital speed of 200 kms@xmath2 .",
    "thus , we would naively expected an unbound version of segue1 reside only a few kpc away from its disruption site before quickly dissipating , making this extreme scenario unlikely .",
    "detailed dynamical modeling appropriate to this system and a knowledge of segue1 s orbital history is required to properly determine the degree of tidal interactions and disruption in this system .",
    "our mass estimates presented in this paper explicitly assume that the kinematics of segue1 are not affected by tides .    to determine the true orbit of segue1 , we need to know its transverse motion .",
    "the heliocentric velocity of segue1 is @xmath79kms@xmath2  and the velocity relative to the galactic standard of rest km s@xmath80 relative to the local standard of rest , for which we adopt a rotation velocity of 220 km s@xmath2 . ]",
    "( gsr ) is @xmath81kms@xmath2 .",
    "we can rule out a circular orbit : in the milky way model discussed in  [ sec_sgr ] ,",
    "the maximum projected gsr velocity for a circular orbit is @xmath82kms@xmath2at the distance of segue1 .",
    "if the transverse motion of segue1 is similar to or less than that of the measured radial motion , then segue1 was closer to the galactic plane in the recent past .",
    "however , there is no clear evidence to suggest tidal stripping is currently affecting the luminous component .",
    "we do not see velocity outliers in our kinematic sample ( which might indicate that these stars are in the process of being stripped ) , nor other clear evidence of on - going tidal disruption ( e.g.  photometric evidence of tidal tails or tidally - induced rotation ) . while the absence of these features can not be used as proof that tidal stripping is not on - going @xcite , it is consistent with our assumption that tidal stripping is not currently affecting the luminous component .",
    "an estimate of the proper motion of segue1 is needed to constrain the orbital history of this object .",

    "the method compares the observed spectrum to a grid of synthetic spectra covering a range of effective temperature , surface gravity and composition .",

    "the results are unaffected by using alternative photometric methods to determine these parameters .",
    "the best matching composition is found by minimizing residuals between the observed spectrum and a smoothed synthetic spectrum matched to the deimos spectral resolution .",

    "this comparison yields precisions better than 0.25dex for deimos spectra with signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) greater than @xmath84 . although the method can theoretically be applied to all types of stars , it has not yet been tested against high - resolution spectroscopic abundances for horizontal branch or main sequence stars .",

    "the observed spectrum in figure  [ fig_spectra ] shows no evidence for absorption at 8689  @xmath94 , even though a more metal - rich star would display this line .    at red wavelengths ,",
    "metallicity is often estimated via the triplet absorption lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite , @xcite and others note that current implementations of this method fail for metallicities below [ fe / h]@xmath95 .",
    "the triplet method is based an empirical calibration of galactic globular clusters and is not calibrated for metallicities below [ fe / h ] @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "the metallicities in the ultra - faint dsph are below this limit .",
    "we therefore do not use this method and strongly caution the use of this relationship for very low metallicity systems .",
    "the remaining analysis is based on the results from the spectral synthesis method above .    while other stars in our kinematic sample have sufficient signal - to - noise to measure metallicity , [ fe / h ] estimates for the remainder of the sample are less reliable .",
    "the two horizontal branch stars seen in figure  [ fig_cmd ] are too hot to display strong metal absorption and what metal lines exist are overwhelmed by the paschen series .",
    "the main sequence stellar spectra are more suitable for metallicity measurement , but have much lower signal - to - noise as compared to the rgb star above and higher surface gravities .",
    "the synthesis method has also not yet been tested for stars with @xmath97 .",
    "the main sequence stars with adequate s / n to measure a metallicity have surface gravities @xmath98 .",
    "the average metallicity for these thirteen main sequence stars is [ fe / h ] = @xmath99dex , with individual measurements ranging from @xmath100 to @xmath101 .",
    "this average is significantly more metal - rich than above and suggests that the mean metallicity of segue1 may be higher than that of the single rgb star .",
    "these results also suggest that segue1 has a significant internal metallicity spread . in support of this spread",
    ", we note that the fiducial isochrones in the color - magnitude diagram of figure  [ fig_cmd ] can not simultaneously fit the rgb and main sequence . while the horizontal branch and main sequence turn - off are well fit in this figure , the single rgb star is slightly too blue , suggesting it is more metal - poor than the main sequence , consistent with our spectroscopically measured metallicity .",
    "these results , however , should be approached with caution .",
    "while there are no obvious reasons the main sequence metallicities should be biased , we remain aware that the spectral synthesis code has not been tested in this regime .",
    "pending more reliable confirmation , we take the metallicity of the rgb star to be representative of segue1 .",
    "kirby et al .  ( 2008b ) demonstrate that the luminosity - metallicity relationship is log - linear for milky way dwarf galaxies across nearly four decades in luminosities ( see figure  [ fig_corr ] and  [ sec_disc ] ) .",
    "given the luminosity of segue1 ( @xmath102 ) , the predicted metallicity based on this relationship is [ fe / h ] = @xmath103 . while our metallicity estimate of the single rgb star in our segue1 sample is more metal - poor than this prediction , the main sequence metallicity is more metal - rich .",
    "the average of these two metallicities is closer to the predicted value .",
    "additional observations are required to securely determine whether or not segue1 lies on the luminosity - metallicity relationship , and in figure  [ fig_corr ] we assume that the average metallicity is equal to that of the rgb star . quantifying the mean metallicity of segue1 and",
    "the amount of internal metallicity spread is crucial to interpreting the formation history of segue1 .",
    "if this object does indeed lie on the luminosity - metallicity relationship and has a significant internal metallicity spread , this is further evidence for that segue1 formed via galaxy , rather than globular cluster , formation processes .",
    "segue1 is spatially super - imposed on the leading arm of the sagittarius ( sgr ) stream . this placement and",
    "its tiny size led @xcite to identify it as a possible globular cluster formerly associated with the sgr dsph .",
    "six other globular clusters have been associated with the sgr stream @xcite . while our measured velocity dispersion and inferred m / l ratio of segue1 suggest that it is not a globular cluster , it is still possible that it could have been a dwarf satellite of sgr that has been captured by the milky way .",
    "we now investigate whether or not segue1 could be kinematically associated with the sgr stream .",
    "@xcite defined a longitudinal coordinate system , @xmath104 , in which the center of the sgr dsph lies at @xmath105 . in this system , segue1 is roughly 130@xmath106 away from the main body of the sgr dsph at @xmath107 ( figure  [ sgr.fig ] ) .",
    "unlike the region near the sgr dsph or the trailing stream of recent tidal debris ( @xmath108 ) , the kinematics of the stream in the region near segue1 are not well determined observationally .",
    "we therefore compare our data to numerical n - body models in order to determine whether segue may be kinematically as well as spatially associated with sgr tidal debris .",
    "our model of the sgr stream is similar in many respects to the @xmath109 model ( i.e. ,  that in which the galactic dark halo potential is spherical ) described by @xcite , with some modifications made in order to simultaneously match both the trailing arm m - giant velocities @xcite and the newly observed sdss leading arm bifurcation @xcite . in brief , the galactic halo flattening in this model is mildly prolate ( @xmath110 ) , and the model sgr dwarf has an initial mass of @xmath111 , a scale length of 350pc , and has been orbiting in a static galactic potential for @xmath112 gyr .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a more thorough discussion of the n - body modeling technique .",
    "figure  [ sgr.fig ] ( left panel ) illustrates the previously noted spatial alignment of the segue1 field with the leading sgr stream ( i.e. the ` a ' and ` c ' streams of @xcite ) . as demonstrated in the right hand panel ,",
    "however , the velocity relative to the gsr of segue1 ( @xmath113 km s@xmath2 ) is wildly discrepant with the leading tidal stream at the corresponding angular position ( @xmath114 km s@xmath2 , grey / magenta points ) .",
    "instead , segue1 appears to be more consistent in velocity with the _ trailing _ stream , from which it is offset by @xmath115 15@xmath106 ( @xmath116kpc at the distance of segue1 ) . _",
    "given these conflicting data , we conclude that segue1 is not physically associated with either stream . _    we note for completeness however that segue1 is consistent in both angular coordinates and radial velocity with an extremely old segment of leading arm tidal debris ( released from sgr @xmath117 gyr ago ) which has been wrapped roughly 520@xmath106 around the milky way from the sgr core ( i.e. the segment of magenta debris at @xmath118 and @xmath119 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "however , conclusive observational evidence for the existence of such old , multiply - wrapped tidal debris from sgr has not yet been established .",
    "our models therefore leave open the possibility that segue1 was initially associated with the sgr dsph , but was removed very early in the tidal interactions between sgr and the milky way .",
    "previous claims of associated cluster systems ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have focused only on relatively recent debris .",
    "there is of course still considerable uncertainty in the ` best ' model for sgr . only models with strongly prolate ( @xmath120 ) halos produce streams that match the leading arm m - giant velocities @xcite , while models with oblate halos ( @xmath121 ) best match the observed precession of the m - giant orbital plane @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a near spherical model is required in order to match the bifurcated stream observed in the sdss @xcite , as is an extremely low satellite mass ( @xmath122 ) which in turn produces streams too dynamically cold to reproduce the observed dispersion among the m - giant velocities @xcite . in figure  [ sgr.fig ]",
    "we demonstrate the behavior of sgr debris in oblate , near - spherical , and prolate galactic dark halo potentials via point - particle orbital tracks ( red , black , and blue lines respectively ) .",
    "while debris from an n - body satellite is not perfectly traced by the orbit of the satellite core , this orbital track gives a good sense of the behavior of the debris ( note how the black line roughly tracks the colored points ) and indicates that it is not possible to construct a model in which leading tidal debris can match the observed velocity of segue1 .",
    "similarly , for no model are trailing sgr debris spatially coincident with segue1 while simultaneously reproducing the trend of trailing m - giant velocities observed by @xcite .",
    "while puzzles obviously remain , these uncertainties do not affect our conclusion that segue1 can not be associated with _",
    "recent _ sgr debris .",
    "there are four stars in our kinematic sample with @xmath123kms@xmath2 , or @xmath124kms@xmath2(figure  [ fig_velocity ] ) .",
    "this is unusual in that standard milky way models predict that such high velocity stars are extremely rare ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these four stars have sufficiently different velocities ( @xmath125kms@xmath2 ) that they are not gravitational bound to each other ; however , given their spatial and kinematic proximity they could plausibly be associated with a single stellar stream . to highlight how unusual this",
    "grouping is , we note that over the eight fields observed by sg07 ( with similar targeting priorities ) , only 7 out of nearly 900 stars had @xmath126kms@xmath2 , with only one field having more than one higher velocity stars ( as compared to 4 of 59 in segue1 ) . since none of the sg07 fields are near any known streams , we circumstantially associated these four stars with the sgr stream .",
    "however , none of the sgr models discussed above match the position and velocity of these higher velocity stars ( filled circle in figure  [ sgr.fig ] ) .",
    "we tentatively associate these stars with older sgr tidal debris or a possibly a new stream .",
    "more observations and theoretical work is needed in this region to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "having established that segue1 is dark matter - dominated , it is interesting to consider the implications of having a massive dark matter halo in such close proximity to the sun .",
    "generically , dsphs have been attractive targets for indirect dark matter detection experiments , via particle annihilation production of gamma - rays , due to their high dark matter densities and lack of internal gamma - ray sources  @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that the even higher dark matter densities of the recently discovered ultra - faint dsphs , combined with their proximity , make them particularly interesting candidates for indirect detection .",
    "upper limits on the gamma - ray fluxes have so far been reported for several classical dwarfs including the draco , ursa minor , and sagittarius dsph @xcite .",
    "the recent launch of gamma - ray large area telescope ( glast ) satellite @xcite makes this a particularly timely calculation .    based on the mass estimates of  [ ssec_mass ] ,",
    "the average dark matter density of segue1 is 1.65/pc@xmath127 inside 50pc .",
    "we determine the gamma - ray flux from dark matter annihilation by marginalizing over the unknown halo parameters using a maximum likelihood analysis similar to that described in  [ ssec_mass ] .",
    "we assume the most optimistic supersymmetric model for the dark matter particle , and refer to @xcite for additional details of the input assumptions .",
    "because we are considering an annihilation signal , the gamma - ray flux scales as the square of the central density and as the inverse square of the distance .",
    "marginalizing over the appropriate parameters , we find the predicted gamma - ray flux for segue  1 is @xmath128photons @xmath129 s@xmath2 . the mean value of this flux is more than a factor of ten larger than that from the classical dsphs and is higher than that predicted for any of the previous ultra - faint dwarfs @xcite .",
    "thus , segue  1 is an excellent target for the indirect detection of dark matter via particle annihilation .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig_corr ] , segue1 lies on an extension of the luminosity - metallicity and luminosity - mass relationships established by brighter milky way dsphs . while the dsphs span nearly five orders of magnitude in luminosity , their mass enclosed within 300pc remains nearly constant at @xmath61@xcite .",
    "this common mass scale has been noted in previous studies @xcite , but remains a very surprising result given the much larger luminosity range spanned by the present data .",
    "it strongly suggests the existence of a characteristic scale in either galaxy formation processes or dark matter physics . at the same time , the average metallicities of the dsphs are correlated with luminosity such that stars in the least luminous dsph are the most metal - poor @xcite .",
    "segue1 is at the extreme end of these relationships : its luminosity is merely @xmath130 , yet its total mass enclosed within 300pc is @xmath61(projecting the mass model discussed in  [ ssec_mass ] ) , resulting in the highest @xmath66 ratio of any known stellar system .",
    "the metallicity for the single rgb star in segue1 is [ fe / h ] = @xmath92dex , one of the most metal - poor stars known in a dsph galaxy .",
    "this metallicity is slightly less than that predicted by the kirby et al .",
    "log - linear relationship , however , we note that the average galactic metallicity may be higher than this single star .",
    "the correlations in figure  [ fig_corr ] are the key to understanding how dsphs form .",
    "while several formation avenues exist to modify the mass - to - light ratio of dsphs , the added constraint of the luminosity - metallicity correlation reduces the number of allowable models .",
    "this correlation rules out a tidal stripping scenario in which lower luminosity systems initially form as more luminous galaxies outside the environment of the milky way and are then tidally stripped to their present state as they enter the milky way environs . in this scenario ,",
    "the metallicity of stars would not be tied to the present luminosity . while ruling out formation scenarios is certainly progress , determining what formation processes can explain the observed correlations will be more challenging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a key question raised by the segue1 results is why the milky way dwarf dsphs have such remarkably different luminosities , yet appear to have similar total masses .",
    "why do all these objects have a common mass halo and is this consistent with the mass spectrum of dark matter halos predicted by simulations ? explaining the mechanism that sets both the mass - luminosity and luminosity - metallicity relationships in the milky way will provide insight to the formation of galaxies at all scales .",
    "segue1 ( @xmath0 ) is the least luminous of the ultra - faint galaxies recently discovered in the sdss , and thus the least luminous known galaxy .",
    "we present keck / deimos spectroscopy of 24  member stars suggests that segue1 is dark matter - dominated and metal - poor .",
    "we measure an internal velocity dispersion of @xmath3kms@xmath2 , and infer a total mass of @xmath4 in the case where mass - follow - light ; using a two - component maximum likelihood model , we determine a mass within 50pc of @xmath131m@xmath59 .",
    "the two masses agree within errors , however , in the first case , the majority of dark matter mass in the galaxy resides within the stellar radius , while the second method leaves open the possibility that the majority of the mass lies _ outside _ the observed light distribution .",
    "the metallicity of the single rgb star in our sample if [ fe / h ] = @xmath92dex , well below that of any known globular cluster @xcite .",
    "although segue1 is spatially superimposed on the sagittarius stream , its mean velocity is inconsistent with recent sagittarius tidal debris in this region .",
    "our models leave open the possibility that segue1 is a dwarf galaxy that was initially associated with the sgr dsph , but was stripped away early in tidal interaction between sagittarius and the milky way .",
    "finally , we note that the combined high central dark matter density and the proximity of segue1 make it an attractive target for indirect dark matter detection experiments .",
    "the number of ultra - faint dsphs around the milky way has doubled in the past few years",
    ". the seemingly ubiquitous presence of these objects has forced a fundamental shift in galaxy formation models at the smallest scales .",
    "the high @xmath132 ratios and dark matter densities of the least luminous dsphs , such as segue1 , may also lead to an improved understanding of dark matter itself .",
    "the promised discovery of many additional ultra - faints dwarfs around the milky way and other nearby galaxies makes this fertile ground for continued study .",
