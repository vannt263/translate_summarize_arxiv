    "in icosahedral molecules and ions , there occurs the possibility of a partial occupancy of a quintet of orbitally degenerate electronic levels , of @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "a notable example is that of positive c@xmath1 ions , with one ( or several ) holes in a @xmath3 molecular orbital @xcite . at the adiabatic level , partly occupied quintet states are unstable against molecular distortions involving the vibrational modes of the molecule .",
    "distortions along nondegenerate @xmath4 modes do not involve symmetry reduction , are therefore not of jahn - teller ( jt ) type , and can be trivially treated as phonon shifts : thus we will ignore @xmath4 modes altogether .",
    "distortions involving fourfold - degenerate @xmath5 and fivefold - degenerate @xmath6 modes reduce the molecular symmetry , and are responsible for the leading ( linear ) contribution to the splitting of the fivefold molecular level .",
    "other ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) modes are involved in higher - order couplings , which become dominating only for substantially large distortions . under specific circumstances ( null or very strong linear coupling )",
    "the inclusion of higher - order couplings could become essential .",
    "however , the present work follows the standard practice of neglecting all higher - then - linear coupling terms and treating the phonons as harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "this approximation provides a simplified model meant to capture the basic shape of the five adiabatic potential energy surfaces ( apes ) in a neighborhood of their high - symmetry conical intersection , hopefully extending out to include the jt minima .",
    "the advantage of the idealized linear model is that it involves a minimal number of parameters , and that it can therefore be studied in detail , drawing fairly general conclusions , applicable to a wide enough range of realistic systems .    indeed , besides c@xmath1",
    ", orbital quintets could be relevant for the spectroscopy of other icosahedral molecules and clusters among those synthesized in recent years , including smaller and higher fullerenes such as c@xmath9 and c@xmath10 , b@xmath11 or b@xmath12 clusters , b@xmath11h@xmath11 , the smallest icosahedral systems si@xmath13 , na@xmath13 , or mg@xmath13 , and icosahedral structures with 13 , 19 , 55 , and 147 atoms in xenon clusters . with different coupling patterns possibly realized in those different systems ,",
    "it is of clear interest to investigate how the vibronic spectrum changes as a function of electron - vibration coupling . for simplicity , here we restrict ourselves to a single mode ( of either @xmath5 or @xmath6 type ) coupled to the orbital quintet .",
    "several works @xcite attach the jt problem of the orbital quintet in the linear approximation and for a single mode .",
    "these early works are mainly studies of the apes , and in particular of its minima , with the phonon coordinates treated as classical variables .",
    "other papers deal with the full quantum mechanical problem , and provide either approximate @xcite or exact @xcite solutions , sometimes for the many - modes case @xcite .",
    "the quantum mechanical dynamics of the entangled electron - phonon system is affected by an electronic geometric phase , whose presence / absence has relevant consequences , in particular , for the ground - state ( gs ) symmetry @xcite , thus for magnetic resonance spectroscopies @xcite .",

    "are incorrect and should be multiplied by @xmath14 . ] .",
    "unfortunately , to date , no experimental determination of the tunneling splitting in any icosahedral jt system is available .",
    "in contrast , spectroscopic techniques can and do provide direct measurements of the jt vibronic spectrum .",
    "for example , molecular photoemission @xcite was recently shown @xcite to provide relatively detailed information on the low - lying part of the vibronic spectrum of c@xmath15 , especially in a specific symmetry sector @xcite .",
    "a clean theoretical understanding of the general features of this vibronic spectrum is therefore desirable .",
    "the present work provides precisely an exact determination of the low - lying vibronic levels of the single - mode linear model , those usually of most direct experimental access .",
    "the spectrum is studied through a wide range of coupling parameters , from weak to strong coupling . in practice ,",
    "the reported results are mainly relevant for weak to intermediate coupling , since , as noted above , the linear jt model is little more than a mathematical curiosity in the strong - coupling limit , where higher - than - linear powers of the distortion become dominant .",
    "the vibronic spectra presented in this work illustrate several interesting quantum phenomena characteristic of dynamical jt .",
    "several numerical energies reported in appendix [ app ] can be used as benchmarks of the accuracy of future calculations based on approximate approaches , for example of the type of refs .  .",
    "the model @xcite describing the jt coupling of the orbitally degenerate @xmath2 quintet with the molecular vibrations of symmetry @xmath16 is conveniently formulated as follows @xcite : @xmath17 here @xmath18 , @xmath19 label components within the degenerate multiplets , for example according to the @xmath20 character in the @xmath21 group chain @xcite , @xmath22 are icosahedral clebsch - gordan coefficients @xcite which couple two @xmath2 tensor operators and a @xmath23 tensor operator to a global scalar @xmath4 operator .",

    "without any loss of generality , the energy position @xmath32 of the @xmath2 quintet will be taken as the zero of energy . in this single - mode problem , all energies are naturally measured in units of the vibrational quantum @xmath33 .",
    "the second characteristic energy scale @xmath34 ( the jt energy ) is smaller / larger than @xmath33 for small / large @xmath31 ( weak / strong coupling ) .",
    "the weak - coupling regime is characterized by rapid tunneling among shallow clustered potential wells and strong non - adiabaticity associated to the vicinity to the conical intersection of the five born - oppenheimer potential sheets ; the level structure is perturbatively related to the harmonic spectrum of @xmath35 . as the coupling grows to intermediate and strong ,",
    "the jt wells deepen and move away from the conical intersection and from each other : tunneling decreases and the vibronic spectrum acquires a characteristically intricate structure , which simplifies again in the strong - coupling limit , where tunneling is exponentially suppressed and semiclassical considerations apply @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic approximation , where the vibrational kinetic energy is neglected , provides the main ( static jt ) features of the strong - coupling limit .",
    "the distortion operators @xmath36 are treated as classical coordinates , and optimal distortions are obtained by minimizing the lowest apes @xcite , for example by means of the pik - pryce method @xcite .",
    "these optimal distortions ( jt wells , or minima ) are associated to specific splitting patterns of the electronic quintet . in particular , @xmath5 modes produce a level pattern of the type @xmath37 , in correspondence to 10 jt wells of @xmath38 residual symmetry .",
    "the situation is slightly more intricate for an @xmath6 mode @xcite , due to the multiplicity @xmath39 .",
    "the coupling scheme , associated to the @xmath40 clebsch - gordan coefficients , produces the splitting pattern @xmath41 in correspondence to 10 @xmath38 minima , like the @xmath5 modes .",
    "the @xmath42 scheme produces a splitting pattern of the type @xmath43 , in correspondence to 6 jt minima of @xmath44 symmetry .    in practice ,",
    "the two - scheme coupling for the @xmath6 modes is a convenient theoretical idealization , since any @xmath6 mode of a real molecule is associated to some amount of coupling of both @xmath42 and @xmath40 kind .",
    "this admixture is conveniently characterized by introducing _",
    "two _ coupling constants for each @xmath6 mode , rather than one .",
    "the two dimensionless linear coupling parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 can be expressed in polar coordinates @xcite as @xmath47 in summary , besides its frequency @xmath48 , each @xmath6 vibrational mode is characterized by a pair ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) of linear couplings , or equivalently a global coupling intensity @xmath49 plus a mixing angle @xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ eleceigval : fig ] shows the evolution of the quintet of electronic eigenvalues as @xmath50 takes its possible values interval repeat those in the @xmath51 interval , except for a reversal of the associated distortion @xmath52 . ] . here , the molecular vibration operators are treated as classical variables , and are taken at the relevant static jt minimum , of @xmath44 or @xmath38 symmetry , appropriate for each value of @xmath50 .",
    "pure coupling of type 1 is recovered at @xmath53 and @xmath54 , while pure coupling of type 2 occurs for @xmath55 . at the special angles @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where cusps occur in the @xmath50-dependence of the eigenvalues , @xmath44 and @xmath38 minima are exactly degenerate : the jt minima collapse into a single flat trough , and the symmetry of the jt system is effectively larger than icosahedral @xcite .",
    "figure  [ eleceigval : fig ] shows that for a given coupling energy @xmath58 , the lowering of the lowest electronic state ( equal twice the static jt energy gain ) is strongest at @xmath59 and weakest at @xmath60 .    to compute the exact vibronic spectrum of @xmath61 , full quantum - mechanical treatment must be applied also to the vibrational operators .",
    "the standard ladder - operator representation for the vibrational coordinates @xmath62 provides a natural product basis of harmonic phonon states centered on the undistorted geometry , times the electronic quintet .",
    "it is straightforward to write @xmath61 matrix elements in this basis and diagonalize the resulting matrix .",
    "this basis centered on the high - symmetry point is especially convenient at weak coupling , where converged low - energy vibronic eigenenergies and eigenstates are obtained by including only few basis states . for large @xmath49 ,",
    "the number of basis states needed for a given accuracy of the low - energy levels grows rather quickly , approximately as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 for a @xmath5 mode and @xmath65 for an @xmath6 mode .",
    "for this reason , and because of the extreme sparseness of this problem , the lanczos method of diagonalization @xcite is especially suitable here .",
    "we use a method very similar to the one employed in ref .  , with the introduction of several refinements to deal with the problem of lanczos ghost states , and the symmetry analysis .",
    "we check all results against basis truncation . for most results ,",
    "inclusion of @xmath66 phonons in the basis is largely sufficient for an accuracy of @xmath67 , but for occasional points in parameter space the basis needs to include up to @xmath68 phonons ( over 8 million states ) to guarantee the required accuracy .",
    "the spectra computed with this method and reported below draw a full quantitative link from weak through intermediate to strong coupling for the @xmath69 and @xmath70 linear dynamical jt model .",
    "figure  [ g - mode : fig]a shows the difference between the exact dynamical jt gs energy and @xmath71 ( the classical adiabatic energy @xmath72 of the 10 @xmath38 wells plus the zero - point energy @xmath73 of the uncoupled oscillators ) , as a function of the coupling strength @xmath74 to a @xmath5 mode .",
    "this residual energy represents the part of jt energy gain not ascribable to trivial adiabatic lowering of the jt minima with respect to zero coupling : this energy difference gauges quantum - mechanical effects on the vibrational motion .",
    "the rapid decrease in gs energy at weak coupling is due to the large drop in quantum kinetic energy in the transition from harmonic oscillations around one isolated adiabatic minimum to rapid tunneling among 10 shallow minima .",
    "as these minima move apart , tunneling is suppressed , and the plotted energy difference turns back up to the strong - coupling value @xmath75 , which measures the zero - point energy gain due to phonon softening at the anisotropic jt minima @xcite . indeed , the second - order expansion of the lowest apes around any of the equivalent jt minima yields two normal modes ( of symmetry @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the local @xmath38 group ) both of frequency @xmath48 , plus a twofold - degenerate softer mode ( of symmetry @xmath78 ) of frequency @xmath79 .",
    "the difference in harmonic zero - point energy @xmath80 provides an accurate estimate for the exact vibronic energy ( fig .",
    "[ g - mode : fig]a ) at strong coupling , where inter - well tunneling is suppressed and the phonon dynamics reduces to harmonic oscillations around the jt wells .",
    "note that the `` new '' frequencies at the wells are _ independent of the coupling strength @xmath74 _ , since for different coupling @xmath74 , the set of five apes differs only for a scaling factor , thus remaining self - similar . at weak coupling ,",
    "the harmonic frequencies at the jt wells remain unchanged , but this expansion is practically irrelevant , since quantum kinetic energy delocalizes the motion far enough from the minima for anharmonic and nonadiabatic effects to dominate .",
    "the vibronic gs symmetry remains @xmath6 at all couplings .",
    "this is eventually a consequence of a berry phase of @xmath54 acquired by the electronic wavefunction as the distortions follow any of the cheapest ( 5-corner ) loops through adjacent @xmath38 minima : this entanglement makes the totally symmetric @xmath4 vibronic combination of the wells less advantageous than the @xmath6 combination , which thus remains the gs for all @xmath74 . indeed , as seen in fig .",
    "[ g - mode : fig]b , even at strong coupling , the @xmath4 vibronic state lies above both the @xmath6 gs and a @xmath5 excitation at strong coupling , these @xmath81 states represent the 10 symmetry - adapted vibronic combinations of the harmonic gs s at the 10 @xmath38 wells .",
    "likewise , in the strong - coupling limit , higher excited states , represent suitably symmetrized combinations of vibrational excitations in the wells .",
    "in particular , the 20 states ( @xmath82 ) converging at strong coupling to @xmath83 represent the tunneling - symmetrized one - phonon oscillations of the new softer frequency .",
    "similarly , the 20 states ( @xmath84 ) converging at strong coupling to @xmath33 represent the tunneling - symmetrized one - phonon oscillations of the modes at the original frequency @xmath33 .    at weak coupling ,",
    "the vibronic levels reconstruct the harmonic ladder , as expected when @xmath85 is a weak perturbation .",
    "the present exact calculation traces precisely the crossover from the weak to strong coupling regime : for accurate numeric eigenvalues , see table  [ tabg ] in the appendix .",
    "it is worth noting that the lowest @xmath4 level , which at strong coupling is a low - energy tunneling excitation , correlates to the @xmath86 multiplet at weak coupling @xcite .",
    "finally , note that the @xmath7 and @xmath8 levels are exactly degenerate for all values of the coupling .",
    "we move on now to study the spectrum for a vibrational mode of @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath61 depends now on two parameters .",
    "each vibronic eigenvalue traces a 2-dimensional surface as @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( or equivalently @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) are varied .",
    "the most effective presentation of these spectra is obtained by means of radial cuts at fixed @xmath50 , plus circular cuts at fixed @xmath49 .    like for the @xmath5 mode , the strong - coupling asymptotic vibronic energies ,",
    "are determined by the normal frequencies of oscillation around the adiabatic jt minima , and these frequencies now depend on @xmath50 .",
    "the five normal modes separate into a radial vibration of unchanged frequency @xmath48 and symmetry @xmath76 , plus two softer doubly - degenerate ( of @xmath87 and @xmath88 symmetry for @xmath44 wells and both of @xmath78 symmetry for @xmath38 wells ) tangential modes , represented in fig .",

    "[ h - mode_theta0.942477:fig ] , the vibronic spectrum in the strong tunneling regions at and around the flat - trough values @xmath93 and @xmath94 is extremely congested : only the lowest - lying states are drawn in figure .",

    "[ normalfreqalpha : fig ] would eventually emerge even in the exact quantum spectrum .",
    "the very large slope in the @xmath50 dependence of many vibronic energies may prove useful in future precise determinations of the jt coupling parameters from spectroscopic data .",
    "several spectral properties of experimental interest are readily accessed by the exact diagonalization method at hand .",
    "photoemission spectra ( pes ) involving the quintet @xmath2 molecular orbital are of course affected by jt coupling to the degenerate vibrations .",
    "if , as is usually the case , the photoemitted electron kinetic energy is much larger than @xmath33 , photoemission occurs in a time much shorter than that characteristic of phonon dynamics . in this limit , it is convenient to apply the _ sudden approximation _",

    "the phonon shakeup contributions to the pes are obtained in terms of the matrix elements of this hole - creation operator @xmath153 between the initial configuration and the final vibronic states .",
    "if we assume that the initial temperature is negligible ( @xmath154 , only the gs @xmath155 is initially populated ) , then the pes intensity for the creation of a spin-@xmath152 hole in orbital @xmath18 is @xmath156 where averaging over the components is implied whenever @xmath155 is degenerate .",
    "if the individual contributions of different orbital and spin component are not separate , the total pes intensity is then @xmath157    for generic occupancy of the @xmath2 level , the spectrum is generally affected not only by jt , but also by intra - shell electron - electron repulsion , and the ensuing multiplet structure @xcite : calculation of the pes in such conditions must take into account several other system - specific interactions .",
    "it thus goes beyond the study of the single - mode rather general model considered in this work .",

    "- : ( i ) when a _ single electron _ occupies the quintet orbital _ in the initial state _ , and ( ii ) when the orbital quintet is initially completely full and photoemission produces a _ single hole in the final state_. in the first case , jt only affects the initial configuration , while in the second case , jt only affects the final states .",
    "the application of exact diagonalization to the two cases separately provides spectra where all non - adiabatic effects and phenomena neglected in the frank - condon approximation @xcite are fully included .",
    "when jt only affects the initial states , the molecule is instantaneously brought from the multi - well intrinsically nonadiabatic vibronic gs to a linear superposition of the final harmonic oscillator states . according to eqs .   and , the peaks in the spectrum are located at the final - state energies @xmath158 , which here simply involve single or multiple excitations of the harmonic phonon @xmath33 .",

    "according to the standard electron - phonon ( non - jt ) frank - condon picture , the percentage of spectral intensity displaced away from the 0-phonon to the multi - phonon excitations increases with the distance between the initial and final equilibrium configurations , which , in turn , is proportional to the linear coupling parameter @xmath49 .",

    "the blue shift of the 1-phonon satellite is not specific to the @xmath167 jt model .",

    "the only other general consideration we can draw from these spectra is that not much regularity is to be expected : unless coupling is very weak , phonon shakeups in the pes from a jt molecule build very intricate spectral structures , which are strongly @xmath49-dependent ( also @xmath50-dependent , for @xmath6 modes ) , even for a single phonon mode .",
    "understanding the general features of a vibronic spectrum is a necessary step towards the interpretation and assignment of the spectra of molecules and molecular ions .",

    "this is relevant , e.g.  for inverse pes of c@xmath15 .",
    "the difficulty of the many - modes jt @xcite is that no linear superposition of the spectra of single modes occurs ( except for the weak - coupling limit ) .",
