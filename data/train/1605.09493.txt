    "<S> we consider a joint source - channel coding problem on a finite - field multiway relay channel , and we give closed - form lower and upper bounds on the optimal source - channel rate . </S>",
    "<S> these bounds are shown to be tight for all discrete memoryless sources in a certain class @xmath0 , and we demonstrate that strict source - channel separation is optimal within this class . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to test whether a given source belongs to @xmath0 , we give a balanced - information regularity condition for @xmath0 , and we express @xmath0 in terms of conditional multiple - mutual informations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that @xmath0 is useful for a centralised storage problem . </S>"
