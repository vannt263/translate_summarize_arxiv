    "this eventually leads to a breakdown of the resonance condition and stems the longitudinal momentum gain .",
    "the superluminal correction does not change the betatron frequency , but it does increases the doppler shifted frequency : @xmath208 . as a result , accelerating electrons can stay in resonance with the laser wave at higher values of the longitudinal momentum and thus gain significantly more energy than in the luminal case .",
    "we have found that three dimensional effects in the superluminal case are similar to those in the luminal case : the particle pushed out of the plane formed by the laser polarization and the channel axis moves along a three dimensional trajectory and its maximum energy is the same as during planar motion .",
    "we also have observed the situations when large deviations from the plane can sharply decrease the particle energy gain .",
    "the developed approach is quite general and therefore it can be applied to examine several seemingly different regimes that we discuss in this section .      in the previous section , we considered electron acceleration and the resulting energy gain when the doppler shifted frequency of the laser wave is close to the average frequency of betatron oscillations .",
