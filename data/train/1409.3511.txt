    "recall a polynomial @xmath0 is _ postcritically finite _ if the forward orbits of its critical points are finite .",
    "then the filled julia set of @xmath1 contains a forward invariant , finite topological tree , called the _ hubbard tree _ @xcite .",
    "the _ core entropy _ of @xmath1 is the topological entropy of the restriction of @xmath1 to its hubbard tree .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to quadratic polynomials .",
    "given @xmath2 , the external ray at angle @xmath3 determines a postcritically finite parameter @xmath4 in the mandelbrot set @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath5 to be the core entropy of @xmath6 .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to prove the following result :    [ t : main ] the core entropy function @xmath7 extends to a continuous function from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "the theorem answers a question of w. thurston , who first introduced and explored the core entropy of polynomials .",
    "as thurston showed , the core entropy function can be defined purely combinatorially , but it displays a rich fractal structure ( figure [ f : core ] ) , which reflects the underlying geometry of the mandelbrot set .",
    "[ f : core ]    the concept of core entropy generalizes to complex polynomials the entropy theory of real quadratic maps , whose monotonicity and continuity go back to milnor and thurston @xcite : indeed , the invariant real segment is replaced by the invariant tree , which captures all the essential dynamics .",
    "on the topological side , hubbard trees have been introduced to classify postcritically finite maps @xcite , @xcite , and their entropy provides a new tool to study the parameter space of polynomials : for instance , the restriction of @xmath5 to non - real veins of the mandelbrot set is also monotone @xcite , which implies that the lamination for the mandelbrot set can be reconstructed by looking at level sets of @xmath10 . note by comparison that the entropy of @xmath11 on its julia set is constant , independent of @xmath3 , hence it does not give information on the parameter .",
    "furthermore , the value @xmath5 equals , up to a constant factor , the hausdorff dimension of the set of biaccessible angles for @xmath11 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for dendritic julia sets , the core entropy also equals the asymptotic stretch factor of @xmath11 as a rational map @xcite .",
    "a rational external angle @xmath3 determines a postcritically finite map @xmath11 , which has a finite hubbard tree @xmath12 .",
    "the simplest way to compute its entropy is to compute the markov transition matrix for the map @xmath11 acting on @xmath12 , and take ( the logarithm of ) its leading eigenvalue : however , this requires to know the topology of @xmath12 , which changes wildly after small perturbations of @xmath3 .    in this paper , we shall by - pass this issue by leveraging an algorithm , devised by thurston , which considers instead a larger matrix , whose entries are _ pairs _ of postcritical angles ( see section [ s : algo ] ) ; no knowledge of the topology of the hubbard tree is required . in order to prove @xmath10 is continuous , we develop an infinite version of such algorithm , which is defined for _ any _ angle @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , instead of taking the leading eigenvalue of a transition matrix , we shall encode the possible transitions in a directed graph , which will now have countably many vertices . by taking the _ spectral determinant _ of such graph ( see section [ s : spectral ] for a definition ) , for each angle @xmath13 , we construct a power series @xmath14 which converges in the unit disk and such that its  smallest zero \" @xmath15 is related to the core entropy by @xmath16 we then produce an algorithm to compute each coefficient of the taylor expansion of @xmath14 , and show that essentially these coefficients vary continuously with @xmath3 : the result follows by rouch s theorem .    as a corollary of our method",
    ", we shall prove that the entropy function is actually hlder continuous at angles @xmath3 such that @xmath17 ( using renormalization , it can be proven that @xmath10 is not hlder continuous where @xmath18 ) .      on the way to our proof",
    ", we shall develop a few general combinatorial tools to deal with growth rates of countable graphs , which may be of independent interest .",
    "we define a countable graph @xmath19 with bounded ( outgoing ) degree to have _ bounded cycles _ if it has finitely many closed paths of any given length . in this case",
    ", we define the _ growth rate _ of @xmath19 as the growth rate with @xmath20 of the number of closed paths of length @xmath20 ( see definition [ d : growth ] ) ; as it turns out ( theorem [ t : rootofp ] ) , the inverse of the growth rate equals the smallest zero of the following function @xmath21 , constructed by counting the multi - cycles in the graph : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of components of the multi - cycle @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is its length .",
    "( for the definition of multi - cycle , see section [ s : graphs ] ; note that our graphs have finite outgoing degree but possibly infinite ingoing degree , hence the adjacency operator has infinite @xmath26-norm and the usual spectral theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) does not apply ) .",
    "we then define a general combinatorial object , called _ labeled wedge _ , which consists of pairs of integers which can be labeled either as being _ separated _ ( representing two elements of the postcritical set which lie on opposite sides of the critical point ) or _ non - separated _ ; to such object we associate an infinite graph , and prove that it has bounded cycles , hence one can apply the theory developed in the first part ( see theorem [ t : zero ] ) .",
    "finally , we shall apply these combinatorial techniques to the core entropy ( section [ s : core ] ) ; indeed , we associate to any external angle @xmath3 a labeled wedge @xmath27 , hence an infinite graph @xmath28 , and verify that :    1 .",
    "the growth rate of @xmath28 varies continuously as a function of @xmath3 ( theorem [ t : newmain ] ) ; 2 .",
    "the growth rate of @xmath28 coincides with the core entropy for rational angles ( theorem [ t : coincide ] ) .",
    "let us remark that , as a consequence of monotonicity along veins and theorem [ t : main ] , the continuous extension we define also coincides with the core entropy for parameters which are not necessarily postcritically finite , but for which the julia set is locally connected and the hubbard tree is topologically finite .      the core entropy of polynomials has been introduced by w. thurston around 2011 ( even though there are earlier related results , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) but most of the theory is yet unpublished ( with the exception of section 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "several people are now collecting his writings and correspondence into a foundational paper @xcite .",
    "in particular , the validity of thurston s algorithm has been proven by tan l. , gao y. , and w. jung ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "continuity of the core entropy along principal veins in the mandelbrot set is proven by the author in @xcite , and along all veins by w. jung @xcite .",
    "note that the previous methods used for veins do not easily generalize , since the topology of the tree is constant along veins but not globally .",
    "after @xcite , alternative proofs of monotonicity and continuity of entropy for real maps are given in @xcite , @xcite ( the present proof independently yields continuity ) .",
    "biaccessible external angles and their dimension have been discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the method we use to count closed paths in the graph bears many similarities with the theory of _ dynamical zeta functions _",
    "@xcite , and several forms of the spectral determinant are used in thermodynamic formalism ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . moreover , the spectral determinant @xmath21 we use is an infinite version of the _ clique polynomial _ used in @xcite to study finite directed graphs with small entropy .      the motivation for our combinatorial construction is thurston s algorithm to compute the core entropy for rational angles , which we shall now describe .",
    "let @xmath2 a rational number @xmath29 .",
    "then the external ray at angle @xmath3 in the mandelbrot set lands at a misiurewicz parameter , or at the root of a hyperbolic component : let @xmath1 denote the corresponding postcritically finite quadratic map . we shall call @xmath30 the critical point of @xmath1 , and for each @xmath31 , @xmath32 the @xmath33 iterate of the critical point .",
    "recall that the _ hubbard tree _ of @xmath1 is the union of the regulated arcs @xmath34 $ ] for all @xmath35 ( for more details , see @xcite ) . in the postcritically finite case , it is a finite topological tree , and it is forward - invariant under @xmath1 ( see figure [ f : tree ] ) .",
    "it is possible to compute the core entropy of @xmath1 by writing the markov transition matrix for the action of @xmath1 on the tree , and take the logarithm of its leading eigenvalue .",
    "however , given the external angle @xmath3 it is quite complicated to figure out the topology of the tree : the following algorithm by - passes this issue by looking at pairs of external angles .    in order to explain the algorithm in more detail ,",
    "let us remark that a rational angle @xmath3 is eventually periodic under the doubling map @xmath36 ; that is , there exist integers @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that the elements of the set @xmath39 are all distinct modulo @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the elements of @xmath42 will be called _ postcritical angles _ ; the number @xmath43 is called the _ period _ of @xmath3 , and @xmath44 is the _ pre - period_. if @xmath45 , we shall call @xmath3 _",

    "the leading eigenvalue of @xmath52 gives the core entropy :    [ t : algo ] let @xmath3 a rational angle.then the core entropy @xmath5 of the quadratic polynomial of external angle @xmath3 is related to the largest real eigenvalue @xmath62 of the matrix @xmath52 by the formula @xmath63    the explanation of this algorithm is the following .",

    "now , let @xmath19 be infinite with bounded cycles , and let @xmath140 .",
    "note that both sides of the equation depend , modulo @xmath141 , only on multi - cycles of length @xmath142 , which by the bounded cycle condition are supported on a finite subgraph @xmath143 .",

    "let us denote @xmath398 , @xmath399 ; since @xmath3 is purely periodic , there exists @xmath400 such that @xmath401 for all @xmath256 .",
    "now , note that for each @xmath256 the derivatives satisfy the inequality @xmath402 , thus for each @xmath256 there exists @xmath403 such that for each @xmath404 one has @xmath405 , hence the points @xmath406 all belong to the same side of the partition independently of @xmath300 , as required .",
    "[ p : bothsides ] if @xmath3 is purely periodic of period @xmath43 , then the ( infinite ) graphs @xmath28 , @xmath407 and @xmath408 , associated respectively to @xmath27 , @xmath391 and @xmath392 have the same growth rate , i.e. we have the equality @xmath409    by lemma [ l : diffpairs ] and lemma [ l : twoperiodics ] , the graphs @xmath28 , @xmath407 and @xmath408 have the same finite form , hence by proposition [ p : finiteinfinite ] they have the same growth rate , proving the claim .",
    "let @xmath2 , and denote by @xmath413 the smallest real zero of @xmath14 .",
    "the proof is a simple quantitative version of rouch s theorem . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath3 is pre - periodic , and let @xmath414 be the minimum distance , in @xmath51 , between ( distinct ) elements of the set @xmath415 .",
    "given another angle @xmath416 , denote @xmath417 the smallest real zero of @xmath418 , and choose @xmath20 such that @xmath419 then , by looking at how @xmath369 moves with respect to the partition @xmath46 , we realize that , for @xmath420 , the pair @xmath247 is separated for @xmath3 if and only if it is separated for @xmath416 . by construction , the @xmath421 coefficient of @xmath14 depends only on multi - cycles of total length @xmath20 , and by proposition [ p : properties ] ( 3 ) all such multi - cycles live on the subgraph @xmath422 , hence the first @xmath20 coefficients of @xmath14 and @xmath418 coincide .",
    "thus we can write @xmath423 for some @xmath424 and @xmath425 , where we used that @xmath426 by proposition [ p : properties ] ( 5 ) .",
    "now , using @xmath427 we have @xmath428 where @xmath256 is the order of zero of @xmath46 at @xmath429 and @xmath430 is a holomorphic function , with @xmath431 . by combining , and , we get @xmath432 with @xmath433 , which implies the claim as @xmath434 . in the periodic case",
    "the proof the same , except one should argue separately for @xmath435 and @xmath436 , and use proposition [ p : bothsides ] .",
