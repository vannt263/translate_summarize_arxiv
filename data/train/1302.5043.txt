    "the semiclassical bohr - sommerfeld model of the atom is extended to electron conductivity in solids .",
    "as the model takes into account only the _ particle _ character of electrons , it lends itself to easy visualization and conceptualization .",
    "it is quantum theoretically incomplete , however , due to the neglect of the electrons wave character .",
    "historically , the bohr - sommerfeld model has been successful for the energy levels , orbit size and ( to some extent ) angular momentum of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the latter was plagued by a small but systematic disagreement with experimental observation .",
    "that disagreement has been removed recently by permitting an electron of angular quantum number @xmath8 ( @xmath0 electron ) to swing through the atomic nucleus , called `` coulomb oscillation''(see fig .",
    "1).@xcite    _ _ applied to the hydrogen - molecule ion , @xmath9 , where the original bohr - sommerfeld model failed , the concept of the coulomb oscillator has successfully yielded the molecule s stability , binding energy and nuclear spacing.@xcite since the semiclassical treatment of @xmath9 serves as a paradigm for the present model of superconductivity , its essential features shall be summarized : the single electron of @xmath9 has two modes of motion in the electrostatic field of the two nuclei : in _ axial _ coulomb oscillation the electron swings back and forth between the far turning points and through both nuclei and the ( empty ) midpoint ( see fig .",
    "conversely , in a _ lateral _ oscillation it swings perpendicularly between lateral turning points and through the midpoint .",
    "the motion is quantized such that the sum , @xmath10 of axial and lateral action integrals , @xmath11 and @xmath12 equals an integer multiple of planck s constant , @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the electron s mass , @xmath15 and @xmath16 its axial and lateral speed , respectively , and @xmath17 its principal quantum number .",
    "this is known as the einstein quantization condition.@xcite        fig .",
    "axial electron speed @xmath15 ( top curve ) , axial potential @xmath18 ( bottom curve ) and total energy level @xmath19 ( bottom line ) of @xmath9 when nuclei are _ far _ apart ( @xmath20 = 6 a. u. ) .        fig .",

    "( b ) associated lateral electron speed @xmath16 ( top curve ) , lateral potential @xmath21 ( bottom curve ) and same total energy level @xmath19 ( bottom line ) .    by ignoring the electron s wave character it is not possible to view both oscillation modes classically as a continuous process .",
    "however , one may imagine that on average the molecule - ion s electron spends half the time in either axial or lateral oscillation .",
    "both action integrals , eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , are conveniently visualized by the area under the respective axial and lateral speed curve @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see figs . 3 and 4 ) . when the nuclei are far apart , as in fig .",
    "3 , then the electron is trapped in the potential funnel about one nucleus through which it oscillates . on the other hand , when the nuclei are sufficiently close , then axial coulomb oscillation occurs through both nuclei as well as lateral oscillation through the midpoint , shown in fig .",
    "4 .    while the ( @xmath8 inclusive ) bohr - sommerfeld model gives the same energies for the hydrogen - molecule ion @xmath9 as quantum mechanics , these theories differ in the _ spatial _ description of atomic entities . to phrase it in a casual but memorable analogy ,",
    "the bohr - sommerfeld orbits furnish the `` skeleton , '' and the schrdinger wave function @xmath24 ( more precisely , @xmath25 ) provides the `` flesh . '' for @xmath9 the skeleton consists of the axial and lateral oscillation widths a0a and b0b , respectively , shown in fig .",
    "2 . these quantities provide proportional measures for the size of the quantum mechanical @xmath9 molecular orbital in terms of major and minor axes of an ellipsoid of revolution , @xmath26 and @xmath27 here the @xmath28 are time - averages of the magnitude of displacement of semiclassical oscillations and the @xmath29 are moments of the @xmath9 molecular orbital .",
    "the relation of oscillation widths in the bohr - sommerfeld treatment with quantum mechanical molecular - orbital size will be useful for the `` squeeze effect '' introduced below .",
    "_ _ the hydrogen molecule , @xmath30 , has two electrons , each subject to coulomb attraction to two nuclei at rest ( in fixed - nuclei approximation ) and coulomb repulsion from the other electron in motion . a semiclassical exploration with one electron confined to axial coulomb oscillation and the other one to lateral oscillation with phases that provide maximum electron - electron distance yields stability and reasonable values of binding energy and nuclear spacing .",
    "a more accurate treatment of the problem is in progress .",
    "nuclei ( dots ) and inner electron shells of atoms ( shaded ) in a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the lines show possible orbits of the single outer electron of each atom , both axially through neighbor nuclei , and laterally about the midpoints . in the depicted case",
    "the solid would be superconducting .",
    "conversely , if the lateral oscillations overswing , then the solid would be a normal conductor .",
    "we now apply insights from the coulomb - oscillator treatment of the @xmath9 molecule ion to a solid . first under the simplest conditions conceivable : ( i ) all atoms are of the same kind ( elemental crystal ) , ( ii ) each atom has only one outer electron ( @xmath0 electron ) , ( iii )",
    "the atoms are arranged in a simple cubic lattice , at ( iv ) absolute zero temperature , @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "the assumptions are overly artificial in order to highlight the basic concept of the superconductivity mechanism  more realistic examples will follow .",
    "three cases are possible : ( 1 ) if the coulomb oscillation of each atom s outer electron is only through its _ parent nucleus _",
    ", then the solid is an an electrical isolator .",
    "in contrast , if each outer electron also swings through the nucleus of a neighbor atom , then the solid is an electrical conductor . which _ kind _ of conductor , depends on the concomitant lateral oscillation : ( 2 ) if the width of the lateral oscillation is less than the nearest - neighbor distance ( more generally , if the lateral oscillation does not lead over the crest of the lateral potential profile ) , then the solid is a superconductor ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . in this case",
    "electron motion under an external electric field can proceed through the crystal only along the network of internuclear paths , delayed but undeterred by the intermediate lateral oscillations .",
    "( 3 ) conversely , if the width of the lateral oscillation is more than the nearest - neighbor distance ( leading over the crest of the lateral potential profile ) , then the solid is a normal conductor , obeying ohm s law . in that case",
    "the directional impetus of an electron under an external electric field gets dissipated by sideways scattering . without an external field ,",
    "the outer electrons of all atoms then behave as a `` free electron gas '' in the crystal .",
    "after these general preliminaries , let us approach actual materials with the coulomb - oscillator model of electric conductivity .",
    "a @xmath32 alkali atom ( denoted by @xmath33 ) has , like the hydrogen atom , a single outer electron subject to the electric field of its nucleus , but now also of inner closed electron shells .",
    "the combined electrostatic effect of nucleus and inner shells  together called the `` ion core''can approximately be expressed by a fictitious nucleus of effective - charge number @xmath34 * instead of the atomic number @xmath34 of the actual nucleus .",
    "one way of fixing @xmath34 * is by the atom s ionization energy , @xmath35 where @xmath17 is the principal quantum number of the outer electron and @xmath36 = 13.6 ev is the rydberg energy ( see table i ) .",

    "solid lines show possible orbits of the single outer electron of each atom , both axially through neighbor nuclei , and laterally about the midpoints . in the depicted case",
    "the solid would be superconducting .",
    "conversely , if the lateral oscillations would overswing , as indicated by dotted curved paths , then the solid would be a normal conductor .",
    "all alkali metals crystallize in the body - centered cubic ( @xmath37 ) lattice ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . in order to view coulomb oscillations in a @xmath37 lattice , we regard a ( @xmath40 ) plane which holds nearest - neighbor atoms , as displayed in fig .",
    "the solid lines show internuclear electron orbits of axial coulomb oscillations between nearest - neighbor nuclei and sideways orbits of lateral oscillations about the midpoints .",
    "in the situation depicted in fig . 7 , the solid would be a superconductor as the lateral oscillations are too short to pass the lateral potential barrier ( here , in curved paths ) .    in order to get an estimate of the width of lateral oscillation ,",
    "the calculation of coulomb oscillations in @xmath9 was extended to alkali - molecule ions , @xmath41 , using effective - charge numbers @xmath34 * obtained from ionization energies @xmath42 , and nearest - neighbor distances @xmath43 from alkali metal lattices . as table i shows , the calculated widths of lateral oscillation b0b ( double amplitude by the notation in fig .",
    "2 ) far exceed the nearest - neighbor distance @xmath43 .",
    "it can be expected that refined calculations for isolated alkali _ molecules _",
    ", @xmath44 , or lattice arrays of @xmath33 atoms , do not much alter this finding .",
    "this would mean that the lateral oscillations do _ overswing _ in cystalline alkali metals and thus render these materials ohmian conductors , in agreement with observation .",
    "the same calculation was also done for molecule ions @xmath45 of noble metals ( element group ib ) whose atoms , like the alkali atoms ( element group ia ) possess one outer @xmath0 electron .",
    "again , the calculated lateral oscillation width b0b in table i far exceeds the nearest - neighbor distance @xmath43 in the crystals face - centered cubic ( @xmath46 ) lattice , in agreement with the lack of superconductivity in noble metals . as will be argued below",
    ", the b0b values of the noble metals can be expected to be reduced by the squeeze effect .",
    "although insufficient to make the noble metals superconducting , this trend would qualitatively explain the different kind of conductivity of alkaline - earth metals ( group iia , normal conductors ) and of the group - iib metals ( @xmath47 ) which are superconducting .",
    "_ _ whereas in alkali metals lateral oscillations of the atoms outer electron overswing due to small nearest - neighbor distance , a new situation arises when alkali atoms are further separated .",
    "this is the case in alkali - doped fullerenes , denoted here as @xmath48*a*@xmath49@xmath50 and illustrated in fig .",

    "applying the idea of directional hierarchy ( @xmath467 ) of the tetragonally layered structures once more _ within _ the conducting layer ( @xmath468 ) , one could search for materials of orthorhombic lattices with _ conducting stripes _ in the @xmath83 direction , separated by insulating stripes of large width in the @xmath320 direction , possibly with mutual attraction to exert squeeze on the intervening conducting stripes .",
    "conceivably this could lead to higher critical temperatures than achieved with tetragonal materials .",
    "the price , albeit , would be even more complicated crystals of , very likely , high brittleness  something more of academic interest than of practical use .",

    "it can be regarded as the search for better `` bulk superconductors . '' since nature optimizes _ binding energy _",
    ", not superconductivity , this approach frequently misses the target . instead of melting mixtures of chemicals in order to crystallize in the structure of maximum binding energy ,",
    "one should _ fabricate _ superconductors  if necessary atom by atom  according to the requirements of the mechanism of superconduction .",
    "if the coulomb - oscillator model of superconductivity is valid , then the task is to _ avoid lateral overswing of outer _",
