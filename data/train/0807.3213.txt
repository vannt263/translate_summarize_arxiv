    "acquiring information about a physical system involves observations and measurements , whose results are subjected to fluctuations , and one would like to eliminate or at least to minimize the corresponding errors . however , the precision of any measurement procedure is bounded by fundamental law of statistics and quantum mechanics , and in order to optimally estimate the value of some parameter , one has to exploit the tools provided by quantum estimation theory ( qet ) @xcite .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "many quantities of interest do not correspond to quantum observables .",
    "relevant examples are given by the entanglement or the purity of a quantum state @xcite or the coupling constant of an interacting hamiltonian .",
    "in these situations one needs to infer the value of the parameter through indirect measurements . for many - body quantum systems",
    ", changing the coupling constant drives the system into different phases and , in turn , this may be used to estimate the coupling itself . in particular , close to critical points , quantum states belonging to different phases should be distinguished more effectively than states belonging to the same phase @xcite .",
    "distinguishability is usually quantified by fidelity between quantum states , _",
    "i.e. _ overlap between ground state wave functions . in turn , the fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) has recently attracted much attention @xcite since , differently from bipartite entanglement measure approach @xcite , it considers the system as a whole , without resorting to bipartitions . in estimating the value of a parameter , one is led to define the fisher information which represents an infinitesimal distance among probability distributions , and gives the ultimate precision attainable by an estimator via the cramer - rao theorem .",
    "its quantum counterpart , the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) , is related to the degree of statistical distinguishability of a quantum state from its neighbors and , in fact , it turns out to be proportional to _ bures metric _ between quantum states @xcite .",
    "as noticed in @xcite one can exploit the geometrical theory of quantum estimation to derive the ultimate quantum bounds to the precision of any estimation procedure , and the fidelity approach to qpts to find working regimes achieving those bounds .",
    "indeed , precision may be largely enhanced at the critical points in comparison to the regular ones . here",
    "we show that the general idea advocated in @xcite can be successfully implemented in systems of interest for quantum information processing . to this aim",
    "we address a paradigmatic example of many - body system exhibiting a ( zero temperature ) qpt : the one - dimensional ising model with a transverse magnetic field .    in most physical situations , some parameters of the hamiltonian , _",
    "e.g. _ the coupling constant , are unaccessible , whereas others may be tuned with reasonable control by the experimenter ( _ e.g. _ external field ) .",
    "therefore , the idea is to tune the controllable parameters in order to maximize the qfi and thus the distinguishability and the estimation precision . in doing this",
    "we consider the system both at zero and finite temperature , and fully exploit qet to derive the optimal quantum measurement for the unobservable coupling constant in terms of the symmetric logarithmic derivative . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "we find that optimal estimation is achieved tuning the field at the critical value , in accordance with @xcite , whereas at finite size @xmath0 , the request of maximum qfi defines a pseudo - critical point which scales to the proper critical point as @xmath0 goes to infinity . in turn ,",
    "a precision improvement of order @xmath0 may be achieved with respect to the non critical case .",
    "the optimal measurement arising from the present qet approach may be not achievable with current technology .",
    "therefore , having in mind a practical implementation , we consider estimators based on feasible detection schemes , and show , for systems of few spins , that the measurement of the total magnetization allows for estimation of the coupling constant with precision at the ultimate quantum level .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ def ] we briefly review some concepts of qet , introduce the symmetric logarithmic derivative and illustrate the quantum cramer - rao bound .",
    "we also review the notion of distance for the quantum ising model . in section [ tzero ]",
    "we derive the ultimate quantum limits to the precision of coupling constant estimation at zero temperature , both for the case of few spins and then in the thermodynamical limit . in section [ tfinite ] we analyze the effects of temperature and derive the scaling properties of qfi . in section [ magnetization ]",
    "we address the measurement of total magnetization as estimator of the hamiltonian parameter and show its optimality .",
    "section [ conclusion ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we recall the basic concepts of qet and the metric approach to quantum criticality , specializing them to the one - dimensional ising model in transverse field .",
    "an estimation problem consists in inferring the value of a parameter @xmath1 by measuring a related quantity @xmath2 .",

    "reasonably the experimenter has good control over the external fields he can apply to the system .",
    "the idea is then to tune the external field to a value close to the quantum critical point . at this value of the couplings ,",
    "an improvement of order of @xmath0 can be achieved in the precision of the estimation of the unknown coupling . to test these ideas in practice ,",
    "we have worked out in detail a specific example , the 1d quantum ising model .",
    "this model provides us with all the ingredients we need , a coupling constant @xmath52 , an external field @xmath35 , and a quantum critical point at @xmath36 .",
    "the main accomplishments of our analysis are : i ) at zero temperature we evaluated the precision in the estimation of the coupling , exactly for short chains of @xmath84 sites and asymptotically for large @xmath0 .",
    "we found that the optimal estimation is possible at values of the field exactly equal to the critical point , independently of @xmath0 . for large @xmath0",
    "we indeed observe a @xmath212 enhancement of precision , and a quantum signal - to - noise ratio independent of the coupling .",
    "ii ) at positive temperature the optimal value of the field is again given by the critical value when the system size is large or the temperature is low . in the other working regimes",
    "the optimal field maximizing the quantum fisher information , defines a set of pseudo - critical points , and the optimal precision scales as @xmath213 .",
    "iii ) we obtained the optimal observable for estimation in terms of the symmetric logarithmic derivative and showed that already in the case @xmath77 it does not correspond to an easily implementable measurement .",
    "iv ) we have shown that for small @xmath0 the measurement of the total magnetization allows to achieve ultimate precision .",
    "using monte carlo simulated experiments and bayesian analysis we proved that this is possible already after a limited number of measurements of the order of few hundreds .",
    "we conjecture that this may be true for any @xmath0 ; work along this line in progress .",
    "overall , we found that criticality is a resource for precise characterization of interacting quantum systems ( e.g.  a quantum register ) , and may represent a relevant tool for the development of integrated quantum networks .",
