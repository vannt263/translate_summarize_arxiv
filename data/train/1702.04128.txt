    ", the presence of the mean flow prevents sedimentation and ensures efficient gas exchange , avoiding the damagingly high shear rates that immersed stirrers would cause .",
    "because of its importance in engineering applications , experimental and numerical efforts have been made to optimize the mixing efficiency and power consumption of orbital shakers  @xcite .",
    "most of the studies focus on the strongly nonlinear regime ( forcing frequency close to the fundamental resonance frequency of the container ) , and in complex container geometries such as erlenmeyer flasks with baffles . near resonance ,",
    "the rotating wave becomes large and displays complex nonlinear phenomena such as wave breaking and hysteresis  @xcite .",
    "note that a rotating wave can also be triggered near resonance in a linearly shaken container through a symmetry breaking mechanism  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental advances using particle image velocimetry ( piv ) measurements in the frame of the container now allow for quantitative mixing diagnostics in this system ( turbulent intensity , local energy dissipation rate )  @xcite .",
    "recently , numerical and experimental efforts have been devoted to understand the orbital sloshing flow in a simple cylindrical container on a more fundamental level  @xcite .",
    "whenever the forcing frequency is far enough from a natural frequency of a free gravity wave , the forced rotating wave is well described by inviscid linear potential theory , and corresponds to a superposition of two linear sloshing modes in quadrature  @xcite . in spite of these experimental and numerical efforts ,",
    "no general picture is available yet for the mechanism that generates the mean mass transport induced by orbital shaking and its dependence with the flow parameters ( aspect ratio of the container , fluid viscosity , forcing amplitude ) .",
    "mean mass transport under forced surface waves is a classical problem of fluid mechanics that received much attention mainly because of its oceanographical interest  see for example refs .",

    ", we focus on the weakly nonlinear limit , where the amplitude of the waves , harmonics and mean flows can be ranked in decreasing orders of magnitude . in this regime , mean mass transport has two distinct origins : ( steady ) streaming and stokes drift .",
    "both contributions add up into what is called the lagrangian mean flow , and it is difficult in general to anticipate whether transport due to the stokes drift reinforces or weakens that due to the streaming  @xcite .    in incompressible fluids",
    ", streaming is essentially the reaction of the flow to the time - averaged non - linear advection @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the linear wave flow  @xcite . in the case of potential gravity waves ,",
    "this basic principle becomes rather subtle , because potential waves do not carry vorticity and as such can not generate a mean flow in the bulk . only in the oscillatory ( stokes )",
    "boundary layers over the container walls and below the liquid surface a non - zero forcing of a streaming flow can take place , and theoretical modeling there becomes highly non - trivial in three - dimensional contexts  @xcite .",
    "an estimate for the steady streaming magnitude can be obtained as follows .",
    "the oscillating boundary layers have a typical thickness @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the wave frequency and @xmath4 the kinematic viscosity .",
    "when the amplitude ( or phase ) of the wave varies along that boundary , mass conservation requires that there must exist a small oscillating flow normal to the boundary .",
    "this flow , called boundary layer pumping , is of order @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the lengthscale over which @xmath7 varies .",
    "since the tangential and normal velocities in the boundary layer are not out of phase in general , their average product is non - zero and induce an effective reynolds stress of order @xmath8 that forces a non - zero mean flow in the bulk .",
    "the structure of this streaming flow depends on the details of the boundary conditions , but its magnitude @xmath9 can be inferred , at least in the weak steady streaming limit ( i.e. , for small streaming reynolds number @xmath10 ) , from a balance between the reynolds stress and the viscous stress @xmath11 at the boundaries , yielding @xmath12 interestingly , the amplitude of this streaming flow is independent of viscosity , although viscosity is a necessary ingredient for the formation of the stokes layers from which it originates .",
    "we recall that this estimate only applies in the weak streaming limit ( @xmath10 ) , for which the wave properties remain unaffected by the weak mean flow . on the other hand , in the strong streaming regime",
    ", the streaming flow can alter the waves , and inertial effects must be considered to solve for the mean flow dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this ( eulerian ) streaming flow contribution , mean mass transport also includes a purely kinematic ( lagrangian ) contribution , the stokes drift @xcite .",
    "fluid particles in oscillatory flows move along gyring trajectories and experience , along these paths , slight variations in the wave magnitude .",
    "this causes them to displace slightly more in one direction and leads to a small mean drift after each wave period .",
    "a noticeable property of the stokes drift is that it allows mean mass transport even for a zero mean eulerian flow .",
    "an estimate for the stokes drift velocity can be simply obtained by multiplying the gyration radius of the particles @xmath13 with the spatial gradient of the wave amplitude @xmath14 : it turns out to coincide with eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalsstr ] ) , indicating that the stokes drift and the steady streaming are expected to be of the same order in the case of potential waves .",
    "although predicting the structure of the mean flow is a difficult task in the orbital sloshing configuration , the above scaling argument ( [ eq : scalsstr ] ) can be readily applied to predict its amplitude , at least in the weakly nonlinear regime . since in this regime",
    "the mean flow does not depend on viscosity , a rough estimate can be obtained by using potential flow theory . in a cylinder of radius @xmath15 , orbitally shaken along a path with circular radius @xmath16 , and for forcing frequency @xmath3 small",
    "compared to the natural frequency @xmath17 of the first sloshing mode of the cylinder , the non - dimensional wave amplitude is estimated as  @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the non - dimensional forcing amplitude . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalsstr ] ) , this wave is therefore expected to generate a lagrangian mean flow of order @xmath20 ^ 2}. \\label{eq : scalub}\\ ] ] this indicates that the mean flow increases very rapidly with @xmath3 , at least as @xmath21 far from the resonance , and that it does not depend on viscosity .",
    "this scaling is compatible with the calculation of of hutton  @xcite for the stokes drift associated to the potential flow solution . however , this simplified potential stokes drift solution corresponds to a purely azimuthal mean flow , lacking the poloidal recirculation , so it can not provide a complete description of the complex mean flow patterns found in the experiments .",
    "in this paper , we present a systematic series of experiments to determine the structure and the scaling of the wave flow and the mean flow in the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "the mean flow is determined using stroboscopic piv , i.e. piv synchronized with the forcing , which naturally filters out the wave motion .",
    "we carefully discuss some key aspects of stroboscopic piv : being a lagrangian method , it can not discriminate the stokes drift from the streaming flow ; moreover , the measured mean flow is affected by a systematic bias due to the arbitrary phase of the acquisition , which can be removed here using the axisymmetry of the mean flow . by varying the forcing amplitude @xmath22 and frequency @xmath23 ,",

    "the mean flow is nearly in solid - body rotation near the center , rotating in the direction of the orbital shaking : @xmath163 for @xmath164 , with @xmath165 the mean angular velocity . at larger radius , the mean azimuthal velocity decreases and the three velocity components become of the same order , marking the presence of a strong poloidal recirculation vortex near the contact line , where the wave amplitude is larger .",
    "a secondary poloidal recirculation vortex of weaker amplitude , located either below or at smaller radius than the primary vortex , is also present .",
    "the location and the rotation of these vortices are found to depend both on the viscosity and forcing frequency . as a result , the mean surface velocity near the wall may be either outward ( mostly in the viscous case or at moderate forcing frequency ) or inward , with the formation of a stagnation circle at the surface in some cases .",
    "given that the structure of the wave flow does not change much in the studied range of parameters , it is unlikely that the weak streaming limit can explain the observed strong variation of the poloidal mean flow structure .",

    "accordingly , the complex patterns of poloidal streaming flow in fig .  [ fig : streamfun ] probably originate from instabilities of the streaming flow , and require to go beyond the weak streaming limit .",

    "[ fig : scalingmf](b ) .",
    "we first note that the range of variation of @xmath177 is considerable : it varies over almost two orders of magnitude in the small range of forcing frequency explored here . here again , measurement ranges are limited by the sweeping of the particles out of the measurement plane after one period for large values of @xmath22 and @xmath3 , and by contamination by residual thermal motion for small values of @xmath22 and @xmath3 . in practice ,",
    "the largest measurable angular velocity using stroboscopic piv is @xmath178 , i.e. , the fluid performs one complete rotation after 100 forcing periods .",

    "a good overall agreement is obtained at moderate forcing frequency , whereas a mean flow slightly smaller than predicted is obtained as the resonance is approached , which is consistent with the weaker wave amplitude observed in fig .",

    "it is interesting to compare the fitted values of @xmath179 with the one we would get with the stokes drift alone ( i.e. , with no eulerian steady streaming ) . from eq .  , and",
    "retaining only the first term @xmath60 , we have k_sto 1.25 , which is remarkably close to the experimental data , suggesting that the mean zonal circulation is predominantly due to the stokes drift .",
    "this might also explain why the mean azimuthal flow is more robust than the the poloidal recirculation : the stokes drift being a kinematical effect associated to the waves , it will be essentially not affected by the instabilities of the streaming flow .",
    "in this paper we characterized the wave flow and the lagrangian mean flow in an orbitally shaken cylinder in the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "the wave flow , measured by conventional piv , shows a spatial structure in the bulk and a scaling in amplitude close to the potential prediction for forcing frequency far from the resonance , @xmath182 , except for a significant phase delay which increases with viscosity . the lagrangian mean flow , measured by stroboscopic piv , is composed of a robust global rotation near the center , and poloidal recirculation vortices mostly active near the contact line .",
    "far from resonance , the amplitude of the central rotation is well described by a simple weakly nonlinear scaling law , quadratic in forcing amplitude , with a weak dependence on viscosity .",
    "this central rotation is mainly due to the stokes drift , which might explain its robustness , whereas the poloidal recirculations experience a series of bifurcations , with changes in the number of vortices depending on the control parameters of the flow , suggesting unstable streaming flow .",
    "only scarce comparisons can be performed with literature at the moment , and a full description of the steady streaming flow , even in the weakly nonlinear regime , is not available yet .",
    "such model would require to build the viscous sloshing modes and to compute from them the momentum transfer from the boundary layer region to the bulk .",
    "this is a difficult task for three - dimensional flows with free boundaries  @xcite , even in the weak streaming limit , @xmath183 . considering the complexity and variation of the steady streaming flows observed here",
    ", we anticipate that the weak streaming limit likely can not capture all the observed patterns , and that a nonlinear craik - leibovich model  @xcite seems required .",
    "the large amplitude of the mean flow near the contact line is also problematic , since this is a very complex boundary layer region to solve .",
    "this specificity has been ignored in  @xcite , but here our observations suggest that this the contact line region might well be crucial in understanding the spatial structure of the poloidal recirculation .",
    "finally , another difficulty in comparing experiments , numerics and theory may arise from possible surface contamination effects .",
    "although the use of silicon oil in the present experiments is expected to minimize surface contamination , it is known that pure free - slip boundary condition at the surface is extremely difficult to achieve , and that departure from this ideal situation may have dramatic influence in steady streaming  @xcite .",
