    "the investigation of fundamental capacity limits of multi - node wireless networks is an open problem in information theory which consistently attracts the attention of researchers in recent years , as it is a difficult question with great potential practical interest . a way to approach",
    "the problem is to study the more restricted situation where wireless nodes are placed according to a spatial distribution ( usually 2-dimensional ) , with a simplified propagation model .",
    "furthermore , we can study the scaling behavior of the total network capacity at the limit where the number of nodes tends to infinity .    in this context , initial investigations focused on scaling laws with specific communication strategies , such as multi - hopping  @xcite , providing important insights on the fundamental limits of wireless networks .",
    "several works studied information - theoretic scaling laws , independent from the communication strategy . however , results usually provide only an asymptotic order for the network capacity ( _ e_.g . ,",
    "most importantly , these results provided insights on cooperation schemes with almost optimal scaling behavior .",
    "for instance , @xcite shows that _ dense _ ( of fixed area and increasing density ) and _ extended _ ( of fixed density and increasing area ) networks exhibit qualitatively different scaling behaviors with regard to the total network capacity ( linear and sub - linear or square root increase with respect to the number of nodes , respectively ) .",
    "in contrast , real networks have a fixed area and density and , in this sense , such scaling laws are of limited use for practical purposes .",
    "this limitation has been partially addressed with an insightful extension in  @xcite , where it is shown that important parameters defining the asymptotically optimal operating regime of a wireless network are the short range and long range signal to noise ratios ( snr ) .",
    "this paper focuses on the derivation of fundamental cut - set bounds on the capacity of wireless networks .",
    "taking a cut partitioning the network into two parts , we bound above the sum of the rates of communication passing through the cut , under any communication strategy .",
    "we rely on a poisson network model , which we analyze using a stochastic geometry methodology , under a rich and symmetric fading environment ( which we describe in detail in section  [ sec : model ] ) .    to motivate our approach , consider a point - to - point channel of bandwidth @xmath0 hertz , and additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with power spectral density @xmath1 .",
    "the channel capacity is given by the simple formula : @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the received power .",
    "this formula identifies two operating regimes : for low snr , we have @xmath4 , and the capacity is power - limited ; for high snr , we have @xmath5 , and the capacity is essentially bandwidth - limited .    in this paper , we provide such a unified formula , as an upper bound on cut - set capacities in poisson wireless networks .",
    "we then show that its asymptotic behavior is richer , but not too complicated ( providing four different asymptotic regimes ) . identifying such operating regimes",
    "is of great usefulness for the design of efficient communication strategies .",
    "we evaluate the cut - set capacity of approximately circular cuts of arbitrary radius , for arbitrary values of all the other network parameters , such as the node density , transmit power , channel bandwidth , noise spectral density .",
    "we confirm that our results are in agreement with the previously known scaling laws identified in  @xcite .",
    "additionally , we derive specific numeric bounds that capture the continuous transitions between different operating regimes , complementing previous related work .    in section  [ sec : model ] , we introduce our channel and network model and we discuss our main results . in section  [ sec : cutsetbound ] , we prove our general cut - set bound ( theorem  [ th : approx_cutset ] ) , and we identify asymptotic operating regimes ( corollary  [ cor : asympt ] ) .",
    "we provide specific numerical examples in section  [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "we consider a network where nodes are equipped with wireless transceiver capabilities ( with a single transmit and a single receive antenna ) and transmissions occur at discrete times @xmath6 .",
    "communication takes place over a flat channel of bandwidth @xmath0 hertz around a carrier frequency @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "node positions remain fixed during a channel use .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the distance between nodes @xmath10 and  @xmath11 .",

    "the gains depend on the distance between the node positions , and on the channel fading .",
    "the channel gain @xmath13 $ ] has the form : [ eq : hij ] h_ij[t ] = r_ij^- h_ij[t ] , where @xmath15 models path loss , and @xmath16 $ ] is a stationary and ergodic random process that models channel fluctuations due to frequency flat fading . without loss of generality , we let @xmath17|^2 ] = 1 $ ] .",
    "we also make the two following modeling assumptions .",
    "first , the @xmath16 $ ] s are symmetric , @xmath16 $ ] has the same distribution as @xmath18 $ ] ( this implies a zero mean ) .",
    "second , the @xmath16 $ ] s are independent for different @xmath19 .",
    "our model is intended as an approximation of a rich scattering environment with a far - field assumption , the node separation distance is sufficient for the channel independence and symmetry assumptions ( and path loss model ) to be realistic .",
    "it includes as special cases rayleigh fading , as well as the random phase model used in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we do not model non - zero - mean or correlated channel gains .",
    "we denote @xmath20 $ ] the symbol transmitted by node @xmath10 at time  @xmath14 .",
    "all nodes have an equal average power budget of @xmath3 watts , for all @xmath10 , @xmath21|^2 ] \\leq \\frac{p}{w}$ ] joules per symbol .",
    "the signal received by node @xmath10 at time @xmath14 is given by y_i[t ] = _ j i h_ij[t ] x_j[t ] + z_i[t ] , [ eq : yi ] where @xmath22 is white circularly symmetric complex gaussian noise of power spectral density @xmath23 watts per hertz ( the real and imaginary parts each have variance @xmath1 per symbol ) .",
    "we consider a cut partitioning the network into two complementary sets of nodes , denoted @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we are interested in bounding above the sum of the rates of communication passing through the cut from @xmath25 to @xmath24 , with arbitrary one - to - one source - destination pairings .",
    "the total rate is bounded above by the cut - set capacity @xmath26 , defined as the maximum of the mutual information between transmitted and received symbols , over all possible distributions of the transmitted symbols that satisfy the maximum power constraint .",
    "equivalently , the cut - set capacity @xmath26 corresponds to the capacity of the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channel between nodes in @xmath25 and nodes in @xmath24 , with a per - antenna power constraint @xmath3 . under the fast - fading model ,",
    "the ergodic mimo capacity in nats per second equals : [ eq : ergodicmimo ] c_ , = _ _ h , where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the positive semi - definite covariance matrix of the transmitted signal vector .",
    "the factor @xmath15 is assumed to be known at both the receiver and the transmitter , as the node positions are fixed .",

[ [ remark ] ] remark + + + + + +    we note that this upper bound is also valid in a general channel model ( dropping the symmetry and independence assumptions ) with arbitrary fading , under the condition that nodes may only transmit independent signals .    using hadamard s inequality ( @xmath30 is positive semi - definite ) , we obtain the upper bound : @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the upper bound is the sum of the capacities of the multiple - input single - output ( miso ) channels between nodes in @xmath25 and each node in @xmath24 , with independent transmissions .    finally , using jensen s inequality ( the function @xmath32 is concave ) , and since @xmath33",

    "the shape of the network domain does not matter , since for the upper - bound computations we will let it tend to the infinite plane to simplify the analysis .    -0.3 cm   of radius @xmath36 and the remaining region @xmath37 , and a node at distance @xmath38 from the cut boundary.,title=\"fig:\",width=185 ] -0.3 cm    we take an approximately circular cut of radius asymptotically equal to @xmath36 , partitioning the network domain into two regions @xmath39 and @xmath37 , as depicted in figure  [ fig : circularcut ] ( the exact form of the cut will be clarified in section  [ sec : approx_circular ] ) .",
    "equivalently to section  [ sec : modelbound ] , we define the cut - set capacity bound @xmath40 on the communication rate achievable from nodes in @xmath37 to nodes in @xmath39 .",
    "we denote @xmath41 $ ] the expectation of the cut - set capacity , over all node position configurations does not have an operational mimo capacity meaning in the shannon sense ; it must be interpreted as the expected value of the shannon capacity .",
    "however , we may also consider informally the case where nodes move slowly but remain poisson distributed ; then , @xmath42 is the average cut - set capacity over time . ] .",
    "our main theorem provides a simple multi - parameter bound on  @xmath42 , as a function of @xmath34 , @xmath36 , @xmath3 , @xmath23 , @xmath0 and @xmath43 .",
    "the bound holds for any individual scaling behavior , as long as @xmath44 , when the number of nodes in @xmath39 becomes large .",

    "the parameter @xmath49 , corresponds to an upper bound on the expectation of the total snr received by a given node , from all nodes at range at least @xmath38 .",
    "hence , we can identify different asymptotic scaling laws , depending on the magnitude of @xmath50 at the upper ( @xmath51 ) and lower ( @xmath52 ) limits of the integral ( tending to @xmath53 or @xmath54 ) .",

    "setting @xmath55 ( the expected number of nodes in @xmath39 ) in the latter , if we omit all the constants for simplicity , we have that @xmath42 is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 equals : @xmath58 and @xmath59 corresponds to the expected received power from nodes at range at least @xmath60 .    in words ,",
    "we identify four different asymptotic regimes .",

    "the capacity bound is @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , with @xmath69 corresponding to the long - range snr , and @xmath70 to the short - range snr , the four described cases essentially map to the operating regimes identified in  @xcite , derived under a different perspective and methodology . accordingly , even though we do not compute lower bounds , the relative asymptotic tightness of our bounds is established by comparing with these related results ; the four optimal communication schemes discussed in  @xcite would achieve almost order - optimal scaling performance if analyzed in our framework .",
