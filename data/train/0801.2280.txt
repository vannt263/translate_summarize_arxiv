    "this paper concerns calculation of expectation values using projected wave functions in inhomogeneous systems . in order to study electronic systems with repulsive on - site interactions , gutzwiller proposed projected wave functions@xcite of the form @xmath2 with the gutzwiller projection operator , @xmath3 to prohibit electron double occupancy on each site . here , @xmath4 with @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) being the creation ( annihilation ) operator of site @xmath7 and spin @xmath8 .",
    "expectation values of operators by this projected wave function can be evaluated by the variational monte carlo method ( vmc ) numerically exactly within statistical errors .",
    "however , the vmc requires lots of computational effort for some issues .",
    "in addition , it needs one run for each parameter set , whereas an analytical method can generate more general formulae that often provide us some hint to understand the system .",
    "thus , instead of the vmc , an analytical approximation called the gutzwiller approximation ( ga ) is used on occasions , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath9 with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 have a fixed particle number @xmath12",
    ". the factor @xmath13 is the gutzwiller renormalization factor for the operator @xmath14 . if one chooses a non - interacting or mean - field approximated wave function as @xmath11 , the expectation value in the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ renorm ] ) can be easily evaluated .",
    "the renormalization factor for the hopping term denoted by @xmath15 is smaller than unity because it is more difficult to hop in the presence of the strong on - site coulomb repulsion between electrons ; that for the exchange interaction denoted by @xmath16 is larger than unity because each site is more often singly occupied to avoid the other electrons .",
    "the ga was first introduced for the hubbard model by gutzwiller @xcite , then reformulated by ogawa _",
    "et al._@xcite a clear description of the method has been given by vollhardt@xcite .",
    "it was also applied to a mean - field theory for the @xmath17-@xmath18 model by zhang _",
    "et al._@xcite improvements of the ga by taking more intersite correlations have been made by several authors.@xcite the ga usually produces qualitatively correct results although it is reported that there are also qualitative differences in some cases@xcite .",
    "the original formulation of the ga implicitly assumes that a wave function before the projection has a fixed particle number @xmath12 ( in the following , we call it the `` canonical scheme '' ) .",
    "if the particle number of a wave function has fluctuation ( the``grand canonical scheme '' ) , then the gutzwiller projection reduces the particle number ( see appendix [ sec : diffscheme ] )",
    ". such reduction of the particle number may arouse a question whether the ga as eq .",
    "( [ renorm ] ) is valid because this equation seems to say that the wave functions before and after the projection have similar properties except for the double occupancy ; are they similar if they have different particle numbers ? to avoid such an unclear path , anderson and ong@xcite , and edegger _",
    "et al._@xcite  formulated a grand canonical ga by taking the canonical scheme as a guide .",
    "namely , one can force the projection not to change the _ average _ particle number , by gluing to @xmath19 a fugacity factor that compensates the particle - number reduction . to our knowledge",
    ", the fugacity factor was first seen in a preliminary form in the paper by yokoyama and shiba@xcite to relate the canonical and the grand canonical vmc .",
    "gebhard@xcite introduced position- and spin - dependent fugacity factors for calculational convenience of the @xmath20 expansion whose @xmath21 limit corresponds to the ga .",
    "they also appear in the construction of the gossamer superconductivity by laughlin@xcite .",
    "then , wang _",
    "et al._@xcite  used position - dependent but spin - independent fugacity factors for inhomogeneous systems .",
    "the fugacity factors allow us freedom to choose a relation between the particle numbers before and after the projection , and the renormalization depends on this choice .",
    "recently , ko _",
    "et al._@xcite  pointed out that two contradictory formulae of the gutzwiller renormalization factors in the literature actually come from two different choices of the fugacity factors .",
    "that is , ( i ) the fugacity factors are determined so that the projection conserves the _ local _ particle density of each spin direction at each site , or ( ii ) so that the projection conserves the _ total _ particle number for each spin direction ( this is the usual canonical - scheme constraint ) . mainly for the square lattice antiferromagnet , they used the canonical scheme , and introduced additional position- and spin - dependent fugacity factors , then calculated each renormalization factor as a ratio of probabilities for the physical process .    in this paper",
    ", we examine in detail several different choices of fugacity factors that impose local / global spin - dependent / independent particle - number conservation .",
    "we adopt the grand canonical scheme , and derive general formulae .",
    "some of our formulae are different from those by the canonical derivation .",
    "furthermore , corrections to the conventional ga are also estimated or derived by taking intersite correlations into account .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : secs .",
    "[ sec : local ] and [ sec : localfug - xstates ] are devoted for the case ( i ) , and sec .",
    "[ sec : global ] for ( ii ) .",
    "first in sec .",
    "[ sec : local ] , we derive renormalization of the hopping and the pairing amplitude , the local spin moments and the exchange interaction from the local spin - dependent constraint .",
    "we test the formulae of the hopping amplitude by comparing with the vmc .",
    "physical interpretations are given for newly derived terms .",
    "subsequently in sec .",
    "[ sec : localfug - xstates ] , we also check orthogonality and excitation energies of projected bogoljubov quasiparticle states , and discuss asymmetry between positive and negative bias spectra . next , in sec .  [",
    "sec : global ] , formulae from the global spin - dependent constraint are derived .",
    "the formulation there includes cases where the particle numbers before and after the projection are unequal .",
    "in addition , grand canonical gas with local / global spin-_independent _ constraints are briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : cano - gcano ] .    in our impression ,",
    "the grand canonical scheme simplifies calculation in many cases because it is free from complicated configuration counting . furthermore , systematic improvement is straightforward by including terms from larger clusters in the linked - cluster expansion.@xcite the formulation we use is similar to the @xmath20 expansion by metzner and vollhardt@xcite , and gebhard@xcite .",
    "the lowest - order theory in the uniform non - superconducting limit of our formulation for the case ( i ) is equivalent to @xmath21 limit of the @xmath20 expansion .",
    "however , in inhomogeneous systems and in the presence of the second and the third neighbor hopping , it is not clear if @xmath20 is a good expansion parameter .",
    "in addition , considering future improvements of the theory , it may be difficult to define terms of very high order in @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , we naively use the linked - cluster expansion as gutzwiller s original formulation@xcite , then expand it in a power series of intersite contractions and neglect high order terms .",
    "furthermore , we do not adhere to making derived formulae into the form of eq .",
    "( [ renorm ] ) .    throughout this paper",
    ", we use the following notation : a wave function before a projection is denoted by @xmath22 and it does not have a definite particle number and may have some inhomogeneity in general . then , the wave function after the projection is represented by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a generalized projector that includes fugacity factors defined later .",
    "the expectation values of an arbitrary operator @xmath14 by these wave functions are denoted by @xmath25 furthermore , @xmath26 in addition , @xmath27 denotes the spin operator at site @xmath7 .",
    "the gutzwiller projection changes electron - density distribution in inhomogeneous systems in general .",
    "however , by introducing fugacity factors , one can force desired electron - density distribution .",
    "we prefer to start from the grand canonical ga with a local constraint for each spin direction , namely , @xmath28 for any @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "note that this local constraint is different from the canonical scheme constraint that conserves the _ total _ particle number .",
    "however , this `` local canonical '' constraint simplifies the resultant formulae as shown in the following .",
    "for example , some of low order corrections to the ga vanish automatically .",
    "furthermore , with this constraint , projected bogoljubov quasiparticle states are approximately orthogonal to each other , and excitation energies are approximatively obtained by diagonalizing a renormalized hamiltonian ( shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : localfug - xstates ] ) .",
    "in general , @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be finite .",
    "such cases will be discussed only in sec .",
    "[ sec : finitesxy ] , and otherwise @xmath31 and @xmath32 are assumed .",
    "furthermore , although we have @xmath0-wave superconductors in mind , there may be deviation from @xmath0-wave in inhomogeneous magnetic systems , and @xmath33 ( on - site pairing _ before _ the projection ) can be non - zero .",
    "we discuss effect of @xmath34 in sec .",
    "[ sec : swavedos ] , and otherwise assume @xmath35 for any @xmath7 .",

    "the generalization to @xmath38 is straightforward .",
    "the projected wave function is defined as @xmath39 with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 the local up and down particle numbers are controlled by @xmath42 , and the fugacity factors @xmath43 will be determined later to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : localconst ] ) . in order to derive their explicit forms ,",
    "let us calculate the density of @xmath8-spin electron at site @xmath7 , @xmath44 in principle , by applying the wick theorem , these expectation values can be exactly evaluated . in practice , however , such calculation is quite difficult to carry out because too many terms appear by the wick decomposition . to approximate it",

    "an approximation to take the leading order with respect to the intersite contractions corresponds to the ga . here , we take only on - site contractions",
    ". then , @xmath48 terms cancel out between the numerator and the denominator , namely , @xmath49 therefore , the condition to determine @xmath43 is given by @xmath50 . by solving the simultaneous equations for up and down spins , we obtain @xmath51",

    "the spin  grand - canonical case is free from this constraint , and spins are renormalized more isotropically .",
    "we have derived various formulae using the grand canonical gutzwiller approximation with several different constraints imposed by the fugacity factors for inhomogeneous magnetic systems . the formulation with the local particle number conservation yields more simple formulae . on the other hand ,",

    "[ sec : localfug - xstates ] , we have discussed the asymmetry of the density of states . although the incoherent spectra are not taken into account in this paper , we speculate that they appear at much higher energy scale than the coherence peaks .",
    "the conventional bcs theory tells us that the quasi - particle excitation spectra are symmetric between positive and negative bias .",
    "in contrast , with the gutzwiller projection , some asymmetry appears .",
    "one may think that electron addition is always more difficult than electron removal if repulsion between electrons is strong .",

    "note that @xmath396 .",
    "that is , if an electron addition matrix element for a hamiltonian is small , an electron _ removal _ matrix element for a different hamiltonian is also small .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry is most likely determined not only by the projection , but also by the hamiltonian .",
    "our ultimate purpose is to find good variational wave functions for systems with strong on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "once the fugacity factors are introduced , one projected wave function can be related to a number of different _ unprojected _ wave functions , each of which is accompanied with fugacity factors of each definition .",
    "therefore , one should probably choose a definition of fugacity factors that matches their purpose .",
    "we speculate that the projected optimized solution is similar in any choice of the fugacity factors if the calculation is done accurately enough",
    ".    there may be slight disagreement with the results by ko _",
    "_ that is , their comparison between the vmc and the ga seems to say that the ga with the position- and spin - dependent constraint has larger errors than that with the global constraint .",
    "however , according to our estimation , the formulation with the position- and spin - dependent constraint has much smaller errors .    to improve the approximation",
    ", one can use techniques of the series expansion method , such as the finite cluster method for calculating higher order terms .",
    "one can also use the pad approximation for extrapolation if necessary , but maybe it is enough just to neglect small terms without extrapolation . since this linked - cluster expansion can be done analytically , there is a possibility to minimize the energy analytically in contrast to the vmc .    the author thanks t.k .",

    "the spin of an electron tend to orient the same direction as those of the other , then electrons prefer to stay at different sites , and not affected by the projection so much .",
    "the gutzwiller projection makes more singly occupied sites , and local spin moments also tend to be magnified ( this is probably related to increase of @xmath424 ) . in the canonical scheme ,",
