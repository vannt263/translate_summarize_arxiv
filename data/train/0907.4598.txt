    "@xcite . in the present work",
    ", this idea is developed from another point of view .",
    "in particular , we address the question whether a statistics of quantum measurement can be utilized as additional source of secrecy .",
    "such statistical data might be adopted in the context of multi - user network , for instance , as a kind of  certificate  for access mechanism .",
    "that is , the statistics is known not only to users but to a trusted entity as well .",
    "so we ask a character of vulnerability of measurement statistics under evil activity .",
    "it is assumed that the used povm may be known to an intruder . to provide a secrecy , more than one sets of quantum states",
    "should be applicable to encryption with the same technical equipment .",
    "we describe the example related to the b92 scheme .",
    "meantime , the presented results may be useful in more abstract sense and other contexts .",
    "as a part of the communication , given quantum channel can be used by legitimate users for various aims . in this work we mean the following scenario .",
    "physically , the sender ( alice ) secretly chooses a state from the specified set @xmath0 and sends this state to the receiver ( bob ) .",
    "then bob performs some quantum measurement @xmath1 generally described by  positive operator - valued measure ",
    "( see fig .",
    "1 ) . recall that povm @xmath2 is a set of positive operators obeying @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the utilized quantum measurement is assumed to be known to both parties .",
    "meanwhile , alice may principally choose the set @xmath0 without giving bob a notice which is required for quantum key distribution too .",
    "the intruder ( trudy ) entangles probe ` t ' with quantum carrier ` a ' and further acts with respect to own pursued interests .",
    "of course , the actually sent state is unknown for trudy .",
    "we now describe an example where trudy s prior knowledge of used povm does not imply her knowledge of actual set @xmath4 .    .",
    "then she sends qudit ` a ' to bob . finally , bob and trudy",
    "perform povm measurement @xmath1 , every on own qudit.,width=309 ]    in the b92 scheme @xcite , alice encodes bits 0 and 1 into nonorthogonal states @xmath5 . in its original version , bob randomly measures one of two projectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 . from the viewpoint of implementation , the measurement is realized by carrying out with probability @xmath9 one of two pvms @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "formally , this is described by the four - element povm @xmath12 further , bob combines outcomes ` @xmath13 ' into one inconclusive answer .",
    "more economical way uses the optimal povm for unambiguous discrimination between @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "however , in this case only one prescribed pair of states can be utilized . on the other hand",
    ", alice and bob can take any two nonorthogonal states from the set @xmath16 with the same equipment for realizing the povm @xmath17 .",
    "the legitimate users can adopt four acceptable pairs for different sances of quantum key distribution .",
    "this is not possible with the optimal unambiguous discrimination . by numerical tests for two - state protocol",
    ", it was found that optimal intruder s probe needs only two dimensions @xcite .",
    "but such a conclusion is hardly valid when one involves all states from the set @xmath16",
    ". a discussion of this question would take us to far afield .",
    "we merely note that a potential resource may be dealt within the b92 scheme .    by @xmath18",
    "we denote @xmath19-dimensional complex vector space , i.e. the state space of @xmath19-level system ( qudit ) .",
    "after interaction the system ` at ' is in a state @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the initial state of ` t ' assumed to be fixed . in general , the evolution of open quantum system is described by a completely positive trace - preserving linear map @xcite called  quantum channel . ",
    "the output density matrices are expressed as partial traces @xmath22 and @xmath23 over the corresponding subspaces . in bob s",
    "measurement on qudit ` a ' , @xmath24-th outcome occurs with the probability @xmath25 . if trudy try to copy the original statistics then she performs the measurement @xmath1 on qudit ` t ' with the probability of @xmath26-th outcome equal to @xmath27 . in the case considered , each of the two probability distributions @xmath28 and @xmath29 is actually marginal of the joint distribution @xmath30 given by @xmath31 . both the probability distributions @xmath28 and @xmath29 should be compared with the original distribution @xmath32 . in addition , trudy would like to conceal her activity",
    ". one of possible approach is to define the perfect standard by @xmath33 we will say  broadcasting  of statistics , when results of copying process are assumed to be compared just with the standard ( [ broad ] ) .",
    "this wording concurs with the notation emerged in ref .",
    "if trudy means a replication of povm statistics as such , then broadcasting can be utilized .",
    "however , this way is rather insufficient when trudy intends to use the obtained results in future action .",
    "for example , her data together with bob s data may be exposed to a trusted authority in some stage .",
    "here she has to consider a special form of broadcasting in which the perfect standard is expressed as @xmath34 for all @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "that is , the factorization of joint distribution is wanted as well . this process will be called  cloning  of statistics . as is mentioned above , statistics cloning may have a practical sense .",
    "it is also interesting from the viewpoint of fundamental limitations on manipulation with quantum information .",
    "after choice of the standard for comparison , we should adopt good figure of merit . in the context of statistics cloning ,",
    "the actual joint distribution @xmath30 is compared with the perfect standard @xmath35 .",
    "the notion of relative entropy is very useful in many respects @xcite .",
    "recall that the relative entropy of @xmath36 to @xmath28 is defined by @xmath37 .",
    "if given povm @xmath38 has been cloned perfectly then @xmath39 . otherwise , a cloning process is approximate .",
    "let @xmath40 be a set of density operators on @xmath18 .",
    "then a merit of cloning can naturally be evaluated by the measure @xmath41 .    to each observable",
    "we can assign a ",
    "projector - valued measure  ( pvm ) . in this sense",
    ", the concept of observable cloning is involved into the above reasons . on the other hand , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite expressed cloning of an observable in terms of its mean value .",
    "another point is that they focused an attention on the incompatibility of observables . at the same time",
    ", a structure of input quantum states can be crucial for use of cloning in eavesdropping process @xcite .",
    "in effect , a small number of states is typically used in the protocols of quantum cryptography .",
    "further , our reasons are expressed purely in terms of probability distributions .",
    "note that there are other ways to evaluate a merit of povm cloning .",
    "for examle , we would adopt the trace distance which has clear operational meaning .",
    "in general , a good choice for figure of merit may be specified by the actual context .",
    "in this section the main result will be presented . for any operator @xmath42 on @xmath18 ,",
    "the operator @xmath43 is positive . the operator @xmath44 is defined as a unique positive square root of @xmath45 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath44 counted with their multiplicities are _ singular values _",
    "@xmath46 of operator @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "so the fidelity between two density operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 is defined by @xcite @xmath49 note that jozsa @xcite used the word  fidelity  for the square of the right - hand side of ( [ defin11 ] )",
    ". this may be more convenient sometimes @xcite .",
    "however , we will further use the definition ( [ defin11 ] ) .",
    "the fidelity function enjoys many useful properties including the quantum - classical relation @xcite . the classical fidelity between probability distributions @xmath36 and @xmath28 is given by @xmath50 the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the fidelity satisfies @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and the minimization is over all povms .",
    "the concept of purification is also needed . adding another qudit ` b ' , we re - express mixed states @xmath47 and @xmath48 of qudit ` a ' as partial traces @xmath54 and @xmath55 . here",
    "pure states @xmath56 and @xmath57 of the total system ` ab ' are purifications of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "then we have @xcite @xmath58 where the maximum is taken over all purifications @xmath56 of @xmath47 and @xmath57 of @xmath48 .    * theorem 1 . * _ a povm @xmath38 can not be cloned with @xmath59 over each pair @xmath60 of states such that _ @xmath61    * proof .",
    "* suppose that povm @xmath38 has been cloned perfectly over two different inputs @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "then associated probabilities are @xmath64 and @xmath65 . for the outputs @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the measurement @xmath68 gives classical fidelity @xmath69 due to the statistical interpretation ( [ relfid0 ] ) , we have @xmath70 .",
    "on the other hand , the fidelity can not decrease under any trace - preserving quantum operation @xcite , that is @xmath71 where the multiplicativity is used .",
    "together the last two relations imply that @xmath72 this inequality is the negation of precondition ( [ the3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath73    thus , the inequality ( [ cothe3 ] ) is necessary condition for perfect cloning of povm over two input quantum carriers .",
    "the statement of theorem 1 gains novel view on cloning of measurement statistics .",
    "let us return to the above example with the b92 protocol .",
    "writing @xmath74 where @xmath75 , we find the distributions : @xmath76 for @xmath14 and @xmath77 for @xmath15 .",
    "the classical fidelity between them is equal to @xmath78 . since @xmath79",
    ", the condition ( [ the3 ] ) is provided . by a symmetry argument",
    ", the same conclusion holds for all the four pairs of nonorthogonal states from the set @xmath16 . in each case , trudy is unable to reach @xmath59 over the pair .",
    "when quantum key distribution is not assumed , alice can change the used pair independently of bob . if both the bob s and trudy s data are exposed to a trusted authority then an intrusion will be detected with high probability .",
    "certainly , an incompatibility property is basic in quantum theory . but another key aspect is dictated by a set of states into which we encode information .",
    "there are two clear cases , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , for which the condition ( [ the3 ] ) can not be valid independently of povm to be cloned .",
    "so we will mean that @xmath82 .",
    "in such a case , if we have the equality @xmath83 then the perfect cloning of given povm over the pair @xmath60 is not possible . it is known that for commuting states this equality takes place if and only if @xcite @xmath84 for all @xmath85 and some set @xmath86 of complex numbers .",
    "for any two density operator , a minimized povm can always be constructed @xcite . on the other hand , for the given povm we can select those pairs of density operators that satisfy ( [ relfid00 ] ) . here",
    "the transitivity takes place , since if the pairs @xmath60 and @xmath87 obey the condition of the form ( [ linrel1 ] ) then the pair @xmath88 does enjoy this as well .",
    "indeed , we have the equalities ( [ linrel1 ] ) and @xmath89 , whence @xmath90 .",
    "so we obtain some equivalence class of density operators .",
    "it turns out that this class is uncountably infinite . in the case of pvm @xmath91 and pure states @xmath92 , @xmath93",
    ", we have @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the following lemma is proven in appendix a.    * lemma 2 . *",
    "_ let pvm @xmath91 be given . for each @xmath96 and any @xmath97 $ ]",
    "there exists pure state @xmath98 such that the equality ( [ relfid00 ] ) holds and @xmath99 . _",
    "the parameter @xmath100 is continuously varied in the interval from @xmath101 to 1 .",
    "so we obtain uncountably infinite set of pure states with the desired properties for any prescribed @xmath102 . using the concept of purifications , this result",
    "can be extended to mixed states .    * theorem 3 .",
    "* _ let pvm @xmath91 be given .",

    "* proof . *",
    "the set @xmath104 is a pvm on the space @xmath105 of the qudits ` a ' and ` b ' .",
    "let us fix some purification @xmath106 of given mixed state @xmath47 . to the chosen state",
    "@xmath106 assign a pure state @xmath107 such that @xmath108 , where @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "this possibility is ensured by lemma 2 .",
    "we now define mixed state @xmath48 as the partial trace @xmath111 .",
    "it follows from the properties of partial trace that @xmath112 and @xmath113 for the prescribed @xmath47 and the built @xmath48 .",
    "so , the classical fidelity @xmath114 satisfies @xmath115 due to eq .",
    "( [ pr4 ] ) .",
    "simultaneously , we have @xmath116 by the statistical interpretation ( [ relfid0 ] ) . hence",
    ", the equality @xmath117 is provided . according to the statement of lemma 2",
    ", the fidelity @xmath118 can be varied between values @xmath101 and 1 by change of the vector @xmath107 and the built state @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath73    using naimark s extension , theorem 3 can be generalized to povm measurement , but the state @xmath48 becomes a density operator on the extended space .",
    "so we may collect density operators into an equivalence class according to the condition ( [ relfid00 ] ) .",
    "each class can further be decomposed with respect to the value @xmath100 of quantum fidelity between two states .",
    "if quantum channel @xmath119 is unistochastic then the general scheme of arguments may be extended in terms of partial fidelities .",
    "uhlmann @xcite introduced the @xmath26-th partial fidelity between density operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 by @xmath120 , where singular values should be put in the decreasing order .",
    "it turned out that all the partial fidelities increase under any unistochastic quantum operation @xcite .",
    "some analog of the statistical interpretation ( [ relfid0 ] ) also holds @xcite . using unistochastic channel",
    ", the given povm can not be cloned with @xmath59 over each pair @xmath60 of states such that @xmath121 , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 denotes the number of povm elements .",
    "we refrein from presenting the explicit calculations .",
    "we consider the simplest case when @xmath124 , the measurement is projective and the qubits ` a ' and ` t ' interact unitarily . for brevity ,",
    "we will write @xmath125 and @xmath126 instead of @xmath14 and @xmath127 respectively . we also define states @xmath128 .",
    "the pvm measurement @xmath129 on the state @xmath125 generates probability distribution @xmath130 ; on the state @xmath131 the one generates distribution @xmath132 independent of @xmath133 .",
    "so , the classical fidelity between these two distributions is @xmath134 . in general , the two distributions differ and @xmath135 .",
    "we shall now describe a procedure for perfect cloning of the pvm over pair @xmath125 and @xmath131 .",
    "the overlap between these states is equal to @xmath136 the perfect cloning is possible when @xmath137 , and hence @xmath138 .",
    "further , we assume that @xmath139 . indeed ,",
    "orthogonal ( and identical ) states can be perfectly cloned , so this case does not add anything new into discussion .",
    "initially , trudy prepares her qibit ` t ' in the state @xmath125 .",
    "then she performs a unitary transformation on @xmath140 specified by @xmath141 by the unitarity constraint , we have @xmath142 , whence @xmath143\\sin2\\eta\\cos(\\varphi'/2)\\cos(\\varphi''/2)$ ] .",
    "the ideal case @xmath144 and @xmath145 is forbidden by the no - cloning theorem for quantum states .",
    "but this is not necessary for the exact replication of the statistics . for arbitrary values of @xmath146 and @xmath147 ,",
    "the needed distribution @xmath132 is provided at the output on both the qubits ` a ' and ` t ' .",
    "the choice @xmath148 leads to @xmath149 and @xmath150 , whence @xmath151 . for given @xmath152 ,",
    "we calculate values of @xmath146 and @xmath133 .",
    "[ for those values of @xmath133 that violate the last condition , the scheme with @xmath153 works .",

    "the states @xmath125 and @xmath126 form an orthonormal basis in @xmath154 . in this basis , we write @xmath155 and @xmath156 . using eqs .",
    "( [ ugt ] ) , we find a representation of transformation @xmath157 as @xmath158matrix with respect to the basis @xmath159 .",

    "the made calculations are outlined in appendix b. it can be checked that the four column vectors of this matrix are mutually orthogonal and unit .",
    "note that only the first and third columns are strictly kept by the requirement ( [ ugt ] ) .",
    "the second and fourth columns are varied under the unitarity property .",
    "we have described the example of perfect cloning of single pvm .",
    "this example is non - trivial , because @xmath139 and the original probability distributions @xmath130 and @xmath132 are different . for each of the two states",
    "@xmath125 and @xmath131 at the input , the measurement on both the qubits ` a ' and ` t ' at the output gives the factorized distribution @xmath164 .",
    "the perfect cloning became possible due to the validity of @xmath137 .",
    "that is , the pair @xmath165 was chosen to be tolerant to cloning of pvm @xmath129 .",
    "we have examined the notion of povm cloning as a special strong form of broadcasting . as figure of merit , the relative entropy of the actual joint distribution to the factorized distribution was proposed . in parallel with the incompatibility",
    ", a character of potential input states can prevent the exact replication of statistics at the output .",
    "so we approached a problem from a somewhat different point of view than the previous studies of observable cloning .",
    "the no - cloning theorem for a single povm measurement has been established .",
    "the presented reasons have been illustrated on the example related to the b92 protocol .",
    "we have also investigated some properties of those sets that are intolerant to perfect cloning of given povm .",
