    "many `` infectious '' processes spread on social contact networks .",
    "the most studied of these are susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) and susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) diseases . for these processes ,",
    "a single transmission will cause infection if the recipient is susceptible .",
    "however , a range of behavioral patterns such as rumor spread or technology use are believed to spread as `` complex contagions '' . here , a node in the network typically requires more than one transmission from `` active '' nodes to become `` activated ''  @xcite .",
    "these have received less attention compared to infectious diseases . however",
    ", their importance for understanding large - scale social behaviors is significant . in understanding processes for which individuals adopt a behavior if they sense that there is a consensus in favor of that behavior , a simple sis- or sir - like disease model will be unable to capture the dynamics .",
    "experimental evidence  @xcite provides support for the hypothesis that people adopt a behavior when they perceive such a consensus , and that this has an impact on the global dynamics .",
    "such behaviors are important for understanding how bubbles form in stock markets or how new technologies are adopted .",
    "we will study the watts threshold model , model introduced by  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "each node @xmath0 is assigned a threshold @xmath1 such that if it has at least @xmath1 active neighbors it becomes active .",
    "we allow the threshold to be a random variable depending on the degree of node @xmath0 . if @xmath2 , then @xmath0 is active at the initial time . in frequently studied cases ,",
    "@xmath1 is taken to be same for all nodes or @xmath3 represents the same proportion of neighbors . by careful choice of the rule for assigning @xmath1",
    ", we can arrive at a range of other percolation processes as special cases of the wtm  @xcite , including bond , site , @xmath4-core , and bootstrap percolation .",
    "we will focus most of our attention on a continuous time version of the wtm , using an asynchronous update rule .",
    "a node @xmath0 receives transmission independently from each of its active neighbors at rate @xmath5 .",
    "we also consider a discrete time version in which active nodes transmit to their neighbors with probability @xmath6 in the time step after becoming active . in either case",
    ", the transmission could be the transfer of an actual infectious agent , or it might simply be the observation that @xmath7 has adopted some new behavior .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as a `` message '' which is passed  @xcite , but in this study we will use the term `` transmit '' .",
    "once node @xmath0 has received @xmath1 transmissions , it immediately switches to active and then begins to transmits to its neighbors .    to study this",
    ", we will adapt a compartmental modeling approach focusing on the status of edges rather than nodes .",
    "this `` edge - based compartmental modeling '' technique was originally developed for sir disease spread and can be applied with a wide range of assumptions about the population or disease process  @xcite .",
    "it allows for a significant reduction in the number of equations used compared to other approaches  @xcite , in some cases reducing an infinite ( or even doubly infinite ) system of differential equations to an equivalent system governed by a single differential equation  @xcite .",
    "we will see that the same approach can give a significant simplification here as well .",
    "because the wtm contains many other percolation processes as special cases  @xcite , this approach can be adapted to those as well .",
    "the primary network class we study is the configuration model networks , a class of random networks which are determined by a degree distribution .",
    "these networks have a negligible amount of short cycles : the existence of an edge from @xmath0 to @xmath7 and @xmath0 to @xmath8 provides no information about the length of alternate paths between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , as long as @xmath0 remains inactive , knowledge about the status of @xmath7 provides no information about the status of @xmath8 .",
    "it is generally believed that clustering enhances the spread of complex contagions  @xcite , and experimental evidence supports this  @xcite .",
    "the basis for this argument is that clustering will tend to introduce correlations between the statuses of a node s neighbors .",
    "thus a node who sees one active neighbor is more likely to see others , and thus more likely to activate .",
    "in contrast it is fairly well established that clustering tends to reduce the spread of sir diseases , even if only mildly  @xcite .",
    "work by  @xcite suggests that clustering may increase or decrease the final size of wtm cascades .",
    "we will use our model to study how clustering alters the dynamics of wtm cascades by studying a specialized model of clustered networks independently introduced by  @xcite .    in our study",
    "we find hybrid phase transitions as the initial active proportion increases .",
    "that is , the final size has a square root scaling on one side of the bifurcation point with a large jump in size at the transition .",
    "these appear to be common in the wtm .",
    "we discuss some of the examples we encounter .",
    "although these do not appear to have been seen in the wtm when initial proportion is the bifurcation parameter , they have been seen in several types of percolation that are a special case of the wtm  @xcite and a similar bifurcation exists for the wtm with average degree as the bifurcation parameter , so this result is not surprising of its own right .",
    "we are able to find some sufficient conditions for the hybrid phase transition to occur .",
    "in particular , there is a hybrid phase transition if @xmath9 for all nodes and neither the @xmath10 nodes nor the @xmath11 nodes form a giant component .",
    "furthermore in this scenario we anticipate that above this threshold all nodes in the giant component eventually activate , but we do not have a rigorous proof .",
    "related analytic work has primarily focused on the final size of cascades  @xcite .",
    "there has been limited work investigating dynamic spread .",
    "in particular section iii of  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) uses equations that implicitly assume that once a node reaches its threshold of active neighbors there is a delay before it becomes active as and once active it immediately transmits to all of its neighbors .",
    "another model of  @xcite allows a transmission rate @xmath5 and focused on the case of a fixed value of @xmath12 with a final transmission probability less than @xmath6 .",
    "this paper derived equations similar to those we will derive for the continuous time spread in configuration model networks , but did not analyze them in detail .    in this paper , we demonstrate a mathematical approach that leads to a straightforward derivation of the governing equations .",
    "we then analyze the resulting equations , introducing some new results on the behavior of cascades and unifying a range of disparate results about the wtm in random networks .",
    "our derivation of the governing equations follows the `` edge - based compartmental modeling '' approach of  @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the observation that if the population - scale dynamics of an epidemic are deterministic , then the probability a random node has a given status is equal to the proportion of the population that has that status .",
    "we perform a subtle shift of focus : rather than trying to calculate the proportion of the population that is in each status , we find it to be easier to calculate the probability a random node has each status .",
    "we will consider a randomly chosen node and modify it such that it can not transmit infection .",
    "when first seen , this modification is often confusing , and we explain it in more detail below .",
    "it is equivalent to the `` cavity method '' used in the message - passing approaches  @xcite .",
    "the resulting model is based on probability generating functions , and so it might be more appropriately called a `` probability generating function '' method .",
    "however we avoid this term because depending on the details of the situation modeled , the resulting equations may not be probability generating functions . indeed in our case",
    ", we will see functions that are similar to probability generating functions , with subtle differences .",
    "the basic derivation can be summarized in four steps :    * we begin with the hypothesis that the population - scale dynamics are deterministic , but node - scale events are stochastic . * if the dynamics are deterministic , then the specific timing of when ( or even whether ) a random node @xmath0 is activated has negligible impact on the population - scale dynamics .",
    "so removing @xmath0 from the population would have negligible impact on the dynamics .",
    "* rather than removing @xmath0 we simply prevent it from transmitting to its neighbors , but allow it to otherwise be as before .",
    "the resulting size is larger than would be seen if @xmath0 were removed , but smaller than if @xmath0 were not modified . since the difference between these is negligible , the resulting dynamics are indistinguishable from the original . *",
    "preventing @xmath0 from transmitting has no impact on @xmath0 s status .",
    "since @xmath0 is a randomly chosen node , the probability it would have a given status at a given time must match the proportion of the population that would have that status at that time ( because the dynamics are deterministic ) . thus calculating the probability the modified @xmath0 has a given status is equivalent to calculating the proportion of the population with that given status if @xmath0 were not modified .",
    "we note that a careful analysis shows that the second and third points are actually unneeded . while they are true",
    ", the key feature is that if the dynamics are deterministic then the probability an unaltered randomly chosen node @xmath0 has a given status equals the proportion of the population with that status , and the probability the unaltered node @xmath0 has a given status equals the probability that it has that status even after alteration . thus calculating the probability the altered node @xmath0 has a given status tells us the proportion of the population with each status in the original population .",
    "we call the altered randomly chosen node @xmath0 a _ test node_. in the configuration model case , the fact that @xmath0 can not transmit to its partners means that their statuses are independent of one another .",
    "we will find a consistency equation which gives us the probability that a random neighbor of @xmath0 is still inactive , which in turn allows us to determine the probability @xmath0 is active or inactive .",
    "a configuration model network is generated by assigning each node a degree @xmath4 independently of any other degrees assigned in the population .",
    "each node is then given @xmath4 `` stubs '' and stubs are randomly paired until each stub is in exactly one pair which forms an edge .",
    "we use @xmath13 to be the probability a random node has degree @xmath4 and threshold @xmath12 .",
    "a neighbor of a random node has degree @xmath4 and threshold @xmath12 with probability @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the average degree .",
    "this size bias represents the fact that the probability @xmath7 is a neighbor of a random node is proportional to the number of neighbors @xmath7 has .",
    "a consequence of the formation process is that a random neighbor of a node has a given degree @xmath4 with probability @xmath16 where @xmath15 represents the average degree .",
    "we note that a neighbor s random neighbor has a given @xmath4 and @xmath12 also with probability @xmath13 .",
    "we will determine the probability a random neighbor @xmath7 of the test node @xmath0 has not yet transmitted to @xmath0 in terms of the probability that @xmath7",
    "s random neighbors have not transmitted to @xmath0 . since the neighbors of @xmath7 ( other than @xmath0 ) are chosen from the same distribution as @xmath7 , this will be the step that leads us to a consistency equation for the probability @xmath7 is still inactive in terms of the probability that neighbors of @xmath7 are still inactive .",
    "we begin by studying a continuous time model . in this model an active neighbor @xmath7 of @xmath0 ( with threshold @xmath1 ) transmits to @xmath0 at rate @xmath5 ( as a poisson process ) .",
    "once the @xmath1th neighbor of @xmath0 has transmitted to @xmath0 , @xmath0 immediately activates .",
    "once a node ( other than the test node ) activates it begins transmitting immediately .",
    "note that we do not count repeated transmissions from @xmath7 to @xmath0 .    .the",
    "variables used in the continuous time model for transmission in a configuration model network [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we let @xmath0 be the randomly chosen test node and @xmath7 be a random neighbor of @xmath0 . if @xmath8 is another neighbor of @xmath0 , the status of @xmath7 is independent of the status of @xmath8 because @xmath0 is prevented from transmitting and thus information about one can not pass to the other .    we define @xmath17 to be the probability that @xmath7 has not yet transmitted to @xmath0 .",
    "we break @xmath17 into two parts : @xmath18 , the probability @xmath7 has not yet transmitted and is quiescent , and @xmath19 , the probability @xmath7 has not yet transmitted to @xmath0 but is active . then @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the probability @xmath7 has transmitted to @xmath0 .",

    "in contrast , here nodes immediately become active and then transmit independently to its neighbors as a poisson process . in terms of when a node @xmath7 transmits to a given neighbor @xmath0 , it does not matter whether the delay occurs after @xmath7 reaches its threshold but before it becomes active or after @xmath7 becomes active but before it transmits .",
    "however , this introduces correlations in that all neighbors of a given node receive transmission at the same time . in populations in which there are short cycles",

    "so a hybrid phase transition in a configuration model network requires @xmath149 for some nodes . with minor modifications",

    "this tree - like property makes them amenable to analytic methods , and  @xcite showed that it is possible to apply the edge - based compartmental modeling approach to sir disease in such networks .",

    "the condition for a cascade from arbitrarily small @xmath49 in a configuration model network is that @xmath134 . in this case",
    ", we have a cascade in the configuration model network if @xmath235 if the initially active nodes are randomly chosen , @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "so this becomes @xmath238 if we instead consider the threshold for a corresponding triangle - based network , it is @xmath239 if @xmath240 , then cascades from arbitrarily small initial conditions are inhibited in the triangle - based network compared to the configuration model . however ,",
    "if @xmath241 , cascades from arbitrarily small initial conditions are enhanced in the triangle - based network in the sense that the threshold is reduced .",
    "we can interpret this result physically by considering an @xmath10 node @xmath0 which receives transmission from a neighbor @xmath7 early in the spread .",
    "we assume @xmath0 and @xmath7 share a common neighbor @xmath8 , and we are guaranteed that @xmath7 will transmit to @xmath8 . in the absence of @xmath68 nodes ,",
    "either the @xmath7 transmission will infect @xmath8 or the combined @xmath0 and @xmath7 transmissions are not enough to infect @xmath8 . at early time",
    ", the @xmath0-@xmath8 edge thus has no impact on the spread regardless of @xmath8 s threshold .",
    "so for initiating a cascade from a small @xmath49 it is irrelevant .",
    "in contrast in an unclustered network , if @xmath0 has the same degree , then it will have one more neighbor it can transmit to , which may have @xmath10 .",
    "we can find a simple case where clustering inhibits cascade spread .",
    "if we set @xmath242 for every node , then no triangle can be invaded .",
    "more generally if a network has a @xmath243clique and every node in this clique has @xmath244 , then the clique can not be invaded .",
    "to see this , assume @xmath0 is the first node in the clique to activate .",
    "it has @xmath245 neighbors in the clique that we are sure are not yet active , so at most @xmath246 of its neighbors are active .",
    "this contradicts the assumption that it activates .",
    "we have investigated the spread of complex contagions through static networks , focusing on the watts threshold model ( wtm ) .",
    "we have adapted the edge - based compartmental modeling approach from sir disease modeling to study the dynamic spread of these infectious processes .",
    "this leads to a compact system of equations for the spread through configuration model and triangle - based networks ( as introduced by newman  @xcite and miller  @xcite ) .",
    "this framework helps us to unify many disparate results about this and related models under a common framework , and derive some new results about threshold conditions for cascades .    in configuration model networks",
    "we find that activation of an arbitrarily small initial proportion can lead to activation of a large fraction of the population iff those nodes who require only a single transmission to become active ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath10 ) form a giant component ( confirming a hypothesis of  @xcite for this case ) . in triangle - based networks",
    "@xmath68 nodes can contribute to the initiation of cascades from a small initial active proportion ( showing that the hypothesis is not true in the presence of short cycles ) .    for configuration model networks ,",
    "we have found a sufficient condition for a hybrid phase transition to occur when there is a sufficiently large initially active population . if    1 .",
    "no node has an activation threshold @xmath146 2 .",
    "@xmath10 nodes do not form a giant component , and 3 .",
    "@xmath11 nodes do not form a giant component ,    then there is a threshold concentration of initially active nodes which will lead to a cascade .",
    "the triangle - based networks we study allow for analytic methods .",
    "however , it comes at a price that the structure of the networks is restricted .",
    "triangles that share edges are very rare .",
    "if we consider @xmath4-clique percolation  @xcite in other clustered networks and find a large component and @xmath9 for all nodes in this component then if one @xmath4-clique in the component becomes fully active , the process will spread throughout the component .",
    "the `` cluster - seeding '' which is often used in simulations where a single node and all of its neighbors are activated for the initial condition will lead to this sort of behavior .",
    "this process will not be captured by our random clustered network model .",
    "in essence , some of the behavior of complex contagions in more general clustered networks is believed to be a consequence of `` wide '' bridges .",
    "this is missing in our clustered networks .",
    "it is easy to adapt this model to the case where initial active nodes are targeted by degree .",
    "this simply involves modifying the choice of @xmath13 , noting that @xmath247 corresponds to the initially active nodes .",
    "this appears as a change in @xmath248 , but we then can not assume that @xmath151 is proportional to @xmath52",
    ".    we can also adapt this to account for biased mixing , where the degree of a node provides information about the degree of its neighbors .",
    "we assume we know @xmath249 , that is the probability a neighbor has degree @xmath250 given that a node has degree @xmath4 .",
    "we define @xmath251 to be the probability that a degree @xmath4 node s neighbor has not yet transmitted to it .",
    "our function @xmath151 would then become a summation of @xmath252 than a function of a single variable @xmath47 .",
    "closely related models have been studied by  @xcite    we could also adapt this to account for a network which changes in time .",
    "assuming for example that existing edges end at some rate @xmath253 , and then the freed stubs seek out new neighbors at another rate @xmath254 , the methods of  @xcite lead us to the new model equations .",
    "a particularly interesting limit of this would have @xmath255 such that nodes immediately find new neighbors when their old edges end .",
    "it would be straightforward to add a recovered class to this model , much as has been done previously in sir disease models .",
    "some of the relevant calculations have already been performed by  @xcite .",
    "we could also consider the possibility of nodes transmitting multiple times .",
    "this would involve subdividing @xmath24 into more components based on the number of transmissions that have occurred , much like the @xmath256 and @xmath257 components that occurred in the triangle - based network model .",
    "we can adapt this approach to consider multiple competing processes spreading as done by  @xcite .",
    "may be interesting for political opinion . for understanding the formation of political groups , it would be interesting to consider 4 beliefs spreading : @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 , and @xmath261 where the two @xmath262 are incompatible and the two @xmath263 are incompatible , while the @xmath27 and @xmath205 processes are independent , with the population rewiring and preferentially selecting neighbors with at least one common belief .",
