    ", such methods can produce quite accurate results , but the results are obtained on the imaginary axis .",
    "a major problem is then the analytically continuing of the results to the real axis , which is an ill - posed problem .",
    "small changes in the data on the imaginary axis can lead to large changes on the real axis .",
    "since the imaginary axis data contain statistical noise , the analytical continuation is very difficult .",
    "there are different ways of regularizing this ill - posed problem .",
    "one method combines the bayesian theory with the maximum entropy approach ( maxent ) , which has been found to be an efficient method for analytical continuation.@xcite other regularizations are used in the singular value decomposition ( svd)@xcite or stochastic regularization@xcite methods .",
    "an alternative is provided by making a pad approximation to the data as a function of imaginary frequency and then analytically continue the pad expression to real frequencies.@xcite a rather different approach is to use sampling methods , where a large number of spectra are added , weighted by the probability that they correspond to the imaginary axis data .",
    "such methods have been proposed for @xmath2@xcite and finite @xmath3.@xcite finally , there are simple approximate methods for obtaining the optical conductivity at zero frequency , @xmath4 directly from imaginary time or frequency data .",
    "two - particle correlation functions , such as the dynamical spin or charge correlation functions or the optical conductivity , provide important information about a variety of properties of the system .",
    "these two - particle functions are much more difficult to calculate in qmc - like frameworks than the one - particle green s function,@xcite and therefore much of the interest has focused on the electron green s function . here",
    "we therefore instead treat a two - particle function , the optical conductivity . while we here focus on transformation of qmc data from imaginary space to real space",
    ", we note that there are also qmc methods giving results directly for real frequencies.@xcite    in this paper we compare the pad , svd , sampling and maxent methods for obtaining the optical conductivity from imaginary axis data .",
    "we define a frequency dependent optical conductivity , @xmath0 , where @xmath5 is a real frequency .",
    "this we refer to as the `` exact '' result .",
    "this @xmath0 can easily be transformed to the imaginary axis , since this is a well - behaved transformation that can be performed with a high accuracy .",
    "we add statistical noise to the data , which then simulate the output of a qmc calculation .",
    "the data are then transformed back to the real axis , using the various methods for analytical continuation .",
    "if the methods work well , we should essentially recover the starting @xmath0 , the `` exact '' result . this way we can judge the accuracy of the different methods .",
    "it is important to compare with a known `` exact '' result , since analytical continuation methods can give spurious structures due to noise in the data .",
    "if a certain method a gives more structures than another method b , it is hard to judge whether these additional structures are real and method a is better or they are due to noise and method b is better .",
    "this problem is avoided if `` exact '' results are known . here",
    "we construct the `` exact '' @xmath0 using results for the two - dimensional hubbard model as a guide for the general shape .",

    "<S> we compare different methods for performing analytical continuation of spectral data from the imaginary time or frequency axis to the real frequency axis for the optical conductivity @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the maximum entropy ( maxent ) , singular value decomposition ( svd ) , sampling and pad methods for analytical continuation . </S>",
    "<S> we also study two direct methods for obtaining @xmath1 . for the maxent approach we focus on a recent modification . </S>",
    "<S> the data are split up in batches , a separate maxent calculation is done for each batch and the results are averaged . </S>",
    "<S> for the problems studied here , we find that typically the svd , sampling and modified maxent methods give comparable accuracy , while the pad approximation is usually less reliable . </S>"
