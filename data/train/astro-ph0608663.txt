    "during the past decade , coherent ( or nearly coherent ) oscillations in the @xmath0200600 hz frequency range were discovered in the light curves of a number of neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries observed by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte)_. in 13 sources , these oscillations were discovered during x - ray bursts ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) , giving the name _ nuclear - powered millisecond pulsars _ to this class of objects .",
