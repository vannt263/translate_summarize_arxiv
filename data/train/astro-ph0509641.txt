    "the deep @xmath16-band capabilities of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) greatly enhanced the ability of astronomers to identify and observe galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "flux in the @xmath16-band can be contrasted with flux in the @xmath17-band , allowing for identification of @xmath1 @xmath17-dropouts .",
    "early studies revealed that @xmath0-dropouts were both smaller ( bouwens et al.2003b ; stanway et al .",
    "2004b ; bouwens et al .",
    "2006b , hereafter , b06b ) and less numerous than dropouts at lower redshifts ( stanway et al.2003 ; bouwens et al .  2003b ; dickinson et al .  2004 ; stanway et al.2004b ; b06b ) . however , since much of the early work was at bright magnitudes ( @xmath18 ) , it was still quite unclear from these studies how this population extended to fainter magnitudes or lower surface brightnesses .    with the availability of significantly deeper @xmath0 and @xmath19 data from the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ; beckwith et al .  2006 ) and the hudf - ps ( bouwens et al .",
    "2004b ) , this situation is largely changed .",
    "there are already a number of papers that take advantage of this depth to comment on the faint - end slope ( bouwens et al .",
    "2004a ; bunker et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter , bsem04 ; yan & windhorst 2004b ) , the rest - frame uv colors ( stanway et al .",
    "2005 ; yan et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the surface brightness distribution at @xmath1 ( bsem04 ; bouwens et al.2004b ) .",
    "these data have also provided us with some new insight into the long standing question of how the universe was reionized . some authors ( e.g. , yan & windhorst 2004b ;",
    "lehnert & bremer 2003 ) have argued that it is largely the faint galaxies that were instrumental in this process , while others have emphasized the role that possible evolution in metallicity or the initial mass function ( imf ) may have on the process ( stiavelli et al .",
    "finally , other groups ( e.g. , bsem04 ) have even questioned whether the observed galaxy population is sufficient to reionize the universe at all .",
    "while providing many interesting initial results , there were a number of limitations to these early analyses .",
    "some ( e.g. , bsem04 ) restricted themselves to a bright limit ( in their analyses of the two most notable data sets ) to minimize the importance of incompleteness , flux , or contamination corrections .",
    "other analyses did not calculate the selection volume for their survey self - consistentally from the observed uv colors ( but rather assumed a simple @xmath20 top - hat selection window : e.g. , yan & windhorst 2004b ) .",
    "moreover , none of these early studies made a detailed account of the uncertainties in their lf determinations or made an attempt to correct for field - to - field variations , which can be substantial ( @xmath21% rms ) for single 11.3 arcmin@xmath22 acs wide - field camera ( wfc ) fields ( somerville et al .",
    "2004 ; bouwens et al .  2004a ; bsem04 ) . correcting for these variations is important for ensuring that a consistent normalization is used at bright , intermediate , and faint magnitudes and thus the derived luminosity function ( lf ) is not compromised . particularly important in this regard",
    "are the implications for the faint - end slope and the number of lower luminosity galaxies .",
    "such objects have the potential to provide the necessary uv flux to reionize the universe ( lehnert & bremer 2003 ; yan & windhorst 2004b ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to redress many of these limitations and provide a systematic analysis of @xmath0-dropouts from some of the deepest , widest area surveys available for study .",
    "we consider fields at three different depths .",
    "the two wide - area goods fields ( @xmath23160 arcmin@xmath22 each ) , here enhanced to include the extensive supernova search data , form the backbone of our probe , providing important statistics at the bright end while controlling for field - to - field variations . at the faint end",
    ", there is the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ; 11 arcmin@xmath22 ) , which in addition to constraining the faint - end slope allows us to quantify the incompleteness , flux biases , and contamination in our shallower probes .",
    "finally , at intermediate magnitudes , we have the two hudf - ps ( 17 arcmin@xmath22 in total ) , which provide an important bridge between our faintest and brightest fields . together",
    "these three data sets provide a good measure of the @xmath0-dropout surface density over a 5 mag baseline , from @xmath24 to 29.5 .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin with a description of the data (  2 ) , describe our selection criteria (  3 ) , and then compile an @xmath0-dropout sample in the hudf .",
    "we use the color information to make inferences about the contamination rate , intrinsic colors , and overall redshift distribution .",
    "we then proceed to an analysis of our shallower fields and incorporate the data from those fields into our @xmath0-dropout probe , deriving the @xmath0-dropout surface density from @xmath24 to 29.5 . in  4 , we compare the present probe with previous catalogs and surface density determinations . in  5 , we use this surface density to derive a lf in the rest - frame uv ( @xmath6 ) and compare it with the lf derived at @xmath5 ( steidel et al .",
    "finally , we discuss these results , comment on the likely physical implications (  6 ) , and conclude (  7 ) .",
    "we make use of appendices to develop some key technical issues , while not interrupting the flow of the paper . where necessary",
    ", we use the `` concordance cosmology '' @xmath25 .",
    "we note that the results are not very dependent on the details of the cosmology and that @xmath26 and @xmath12 change by @xmath27% (  5 ) when expressed in terms of the one year wmap measurements @xmath28 ; spergel et al.2003 ) .",
    "as noted above , the present analysis leverages data sets of three different depths to obtain a fairly optimal measure of the number densities of @xmath0-dropouts over a 5 mag baseline .",

    "the zeropoints used for these images are the latest values from the continuing acs calibrations ( sirianni et al .",
    "photometry performed using these zeropoints was offset slightly to account for the estimated galactic absorption @xmath40 ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) .",

    "the pointings were arranged in a @xmath42 grid , each separated by 45 .",
    "although there is some variation in depth across the mosaic , typical @xmath43 limits for the images were 27.6 and 27.4 in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 passbands ( 0.6-diameter aperture ) , respectively .",
    "our reduction of the nicmos data was a slight improvement on that initially made available with the treasury release and was made possible by more exact position matching with the hudf @xmath16-band image .",
    "this reduction is described in more detail in thompson et al .",
    "the resulting nic3 psfs had fwhms of 0.33@xmath39and 0.37@xmath39 in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands , respectively .",

    "these zeropoints are offset by @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( de jong et al .",
    "2006 ) from those previously made available by the space telescope science institute ( stsci ; 2004 june ) .",
    "the two hudf - ps were taken in parallel to the hudf nicmos observations ( go-9803 : thompson et al .",
    "each field consists of 72 orbits of acs observations ( 9 orbits of @xmath29 , 9 orbits of @xmath30 , 18 orbits of @xmath17 , 27 orbits of @xmath16 , and 9 orbits of g800l ) that reaches nearly @xmath48 mag deeper than the original 5-epoch acs goods observations .",
    "they also reach fainter ( @xmath49 mag ) than the wfpc2 hdf - n ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) and hdf - s ( williams et al.2000 ) .",
    "processing of the data included alignment , background subtraction , cosmic ray rejection , and drizzling onto a 0.03@xmath39 grid , and was performed by the `` apsis '' pipeline ( blakeslee et al.2003 ) .",
    "artifacts in the original exposures such as satellite trails or the `` figure eight '' patterns ( resulting from scattered light off the internal dewars ) were explicitly masked out before drizzling the images together .",
    "the reductions of these fields used in this paper are different from those described in several previous publications ( blakeslee et al .",
    "2004 ; bouwens et al .",
    "our principal reason for this was to bin the data on a very similar 0.03-pixel scale to that available for the acs goods fields (  2.3 ) and the hudf ( beckwith et al .",
    "the similar pixel scale made it straightforward to degrade the deeper data to the quality of the shallower data and therefore estimate quantities like the completeness , flux biases , and contamination rate ( see appendix c ) .    to maximize depth , we combined the acs parallel data ( thompson et al.2005 ) with overlapping acs wfc exposures from the cdf - s goods ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004a ) , gems ( rix et al .  2004 ) , and sne search programs ( a. riess et al .  2006 , in preparation ) . incorporating the latter data resulted in modest increases in the mean depth of our images ( @xmath50 mag ) .",
    "only regions having exposure times in excess of 5 orbits , 11 orbits , and 18 orbits in the @xmath30 , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 bands , respectively , are considered in our selection ( or equivalently their @xmath41 depths were required to exceed 28.9 , 28.6 , and 28.1 in the @xmath30 , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 bands , respectively , in a 0.2-diameter apertures ) .",
    "this corresponded to 10.0 arcmin@xmath22 in the first hudf - parallel [ hereafter , referred to as hudfp1 ] and 7.0 arcmin@xmath22 in the second [ hereafter , referred to as hudfp2 ] .",
    "the @xmath41 depths for the deepest portion of these parallels were 28.9 , 29.2 , 28.8 , and 28.5 in the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 bands , respectively , in 0.2-diameter apertures ( @xmath230.7 - 1.1 mags less deep than the hudf ) .",
    "the current analysis makes use of our own reductions of the acs data available over the two goods fields ( @xmath51 arcmin@xmath22 ) .",
    "though a public reduction of the data over this area was available ( i.e. , the goods version 1.0 reduction : giavalisco et al .",
    "2004a ) , it did not include the significant amounts of acs data taken over these fields after the initial 398-orbit goods campaign .",
    "these include 195 orbits of @xmath52 data taken for additional sne searches ( a. riess et al .",

    "2005 , in preparation ) , @xmath54 orbits of overlapping @xmath30 and @xmath16 data from the gems program ( rix et al .",
    "2004 ) , and 128 orbits of @xmath38 data over the acs parallels to the hudf nicmos field ( thompson et al .",
    "2005 ) . these data",
    "substantially enhance the goods version 1.0 data set , and should largely be included in the goods version 2.0 release . instead of waiting for the release , we carried out our own reduction .",
    "similar to our handling of the hudf - parallel acs fields , we processed the acs data with our `` apsis '' pipeline ( blakeslee et al .",
    "they were drizzled onto the same astrometric grid as the images ( 35 individual 8k x 8k frames ) which made up the v1.0 reductions of the two goods fields ( giavalisco et al .",
    "these images  and our own reductions  were done on a 0.03@xmath39pixel scale very similar to the hudf .",
    "the approximate @xmath41 depths of those data were 28.2 , 28.4 , 27.7 , and 27.5 in the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 bands , respectively .",
    "these data reach nearly @xmath55 mag and @xmath56 mag deeper in the @xmath17 and @xmath16 bands , respectively , than the goods v1.0 reductions .    one complication with the analysis of the two goods fields is the notable variation in the depth .",
    "the extensive overlap regions between adjacent exposures in the acs tiling ( @xmath57 arcmin@xmath22 for each field ) are appreciably deeper ( @xmath56 mag ) , the many outer regions ( @xmath15 arcmin@xmath22 for each field ) only covered by three epochs of data ( 5 epochs including the sne search data ) are shallower ( @xmath58 mag ) , and other regions of these fields with missing exposures ( e.g. , due to guide star acquisition problems ) also are shallower ( giavalisco et al",
    ".  2004a ) . as we demonstrated in an earlier study on the @xmath0-dropouts in the rdcs1252 - 2927 field ( bouwens et al .",
    "2003b ) , such variations can have a dramatic impact on the number of @xmath0-dropouts selected ( changing the numbers by factors of @xmath59 for just @xmath230.4 mag alterations in depth ) , and therefore any selection of @xmath0-dropouts off the undegraded goods images requires an accurate accounting for these variations .",
    "this could be done , for example , by laying down objects at random positions across the goods mosaic and then attempting to recover them . instead of adopting this more involved approach",
    ", we took a simpler route , degrading the entire frame to a uniform s / n and ignoring regions below this s / n in the object selection .",
    "our procedure for executing the degradation is detailed in appendix b. the threshold we settled on was @xmath60 mag brighter than that obtained with a 2.5 , 3.5 , and 9-orbit exposure in the @xmath30 , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 bands , respectively , and was chosen as a compromise between depth and area .",
    "this threshold is equivalent to 10@xmath61 depths of 28.3 , 27.5 , and 27.4 in the @xmath30 , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 bands , respectively . throughout this work , this is what we mean when we refer to the s / n levels of the goods fields ( or to deeper fields degraded to goods depth ) .",
    "we also made use of the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac ) @xmath62 data for the cdf - s goods field ( b. vandame et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) to better estimate the contamination from lower redshift interlopers .",
    "the data consist of 21 separate @xmath233 - 4 hr @xmath63 isaac exposures in the @xmath33 ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath36 ( @xmath65 ) bands that reach @xmath2325.7 and @xmath2325 ab magnitudes ( @xmath43 ) , respectively , in a 0.8-diameter aperture .",
    "the entire mosaic covers 131 arcmin@xmath22 or about @xmath66% of the acs goods area .",
    "b. vandame et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) estimated the seeing for the frames to range from 0.31@xmath39to 0.66 , with a median value of 0.46 .",
    "zero points for the individual isaac frames were derived by matching photometry of @xmath2350 stars on each frame with the shallower sofi ( arnouts et al .",
    "2001 ) and two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al .",
    "1997 ) images .    as a check on the zero points , we performed photometry on the @xmath67 @xmath68 e / s0s in each isaac frame ( acs @xmath69 + isaac @xmath62 bands ) and",
    "then fit a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to the six optical - infrared fluxes .",
    "while our @xmath36-band fluxes are in excellent agreement with the fit results , we noticed that our @xmath33-band fluxes were generally @xmath70 mag fainter than expected . since b. vandame et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) noted a similar @xmath70 mag faintward offset relative to the photometry of the k20 survey ( cimatti et al.2002 ) , we took this offset to be real and offset the @xmath33-band zeropoints quoted by b. vandame et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) by 0.1 mag .",
    "no such shifts were applied to the @xmath36-band fluxes .",
    "similarly , the seeing estimates obtained for different isaac images ( b. vandame et al .  2006 , in preparation ) were examined and compared with our own estimates . in general , the fwhms we obtained were @xmath71@xmath39 to @xmath72@xmath39 larger than the b. vandame et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) estimates . we elected to apply our estimates throughout in determining the optical - infrared colors of objects in the cdf - south goods field ( i.e. , appendix d4.1 ) . given that our only use of @xmath33 and @xmath36 photometry in this study is for quantifying contamination",
    ", these adjustments should have no large effect on the other quantities derived here .",
    "our procedure for doing object detection and photometry is identical to that detailed in a number of previous publications by our group ( e.g. , bouwens et al . 2003a ; bouwens et al .  2006a , hereinafter , b06a ) .",
    "sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) was run in double - image mode , with the @xmath16-band images used for object detection and the other images used as the measurement images . the infrared coverage ",
    "although superior in probing beyond the break  was not used in the detection procedure because ( 1 ) the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and resolution of these images were in general much poorer than the @xmath16-band images and ( 2 ) these images  where available  tended to be very inhomogeneous in nature .",
    "photometry was done using two scaled kron ( 1980 ) apertures , the smaller ones to measure colors and the larger ones to convert these colors to total magnitudes .",
    "small corrections were applied to the total magnitudes ( @xmath60 mag to the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath17 bands and @xmath73 mag in the @xmath16 band : sirianni et al .",
    "2005 ) to account for the flux that falls outside these apertures ( typically @xmath74 in diameter ) .",
    "optical - infrared colors were obtained by degrading the optical images to the same psf as the coincident infrared image and then measuring the flux in an aperture that maximized the s / n ( typically 0.8 - 1.4-diameter apertures ) .",
    "one minor issue in the construction of our @xmath0-dropout catalogs was the choice of the sextractor deblending parameter .",
    "a small value for this parameter minimizes blending with foreground sources , but also causes many of the more clumpy @xmath0-dropouts to split into multiple pieces .",
    "conversely , a large value for this parameter largely avoids such splitting , but results in more blending with foreground sources .",
    "after extensive testing , we opted to use a larger value for the deblending parameter ( i.e. , deblend_mincont = 0.15 ) than the defaults ( i.e. , deblend_mincont = 0.005 ) .",
    "although this results in a greater degree of blending ( e.g. , 17% of @xmath0-dropouts are blended with foreground objects in the hudf vs. 11% using much smaller deblending parameters : appendix d1 ) , it should avoid splitting physically - associated systems into multiple pieces  which would result in small systematic errors .",
    "corrections can be made for these additional incompleteness levels ( see appendix d1 ) . to ensure that the object blending was reasonable ,",
    "a detailed visual inspection was performed on each of the objects in our samples (  3.2 ;  3.4 ) .",
    "no objects were found that included any obvious contribution from foreground sources .",
    "the highly unique colors of dropout sources made this check a fairly unambiguous process .",
    "as in several previous publications on this subject ( stanway et al.2003 ; bouwens et al .  2004a ; dickinson et al .  2004",
    "; b06a ) , @xmath0-dropouts are selected using a simple @xmath75 cut . at intermediate magnitudes ( @xmath76 ) ,",
    "such cuts have already been shown to be quite efficient at isolating objects with blue @xmath77 colors indicative of @xmath1 starbursts ( stanway et al.2003 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2003b ; dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ; stanway et al.2005 ; b06a ) .",

    "2003 ; bouwens et al .  2004a ; b06a ) was motivated by our desire to maximize the size of our sample . while this also results in a somewhat higher contamination rate ( appendix d4 ) , an increasing amount of data is now available , both in the ir ( thompson et al .",

    "in addition to our @xmath83 criteria , we also required that objects have @xmath84 colors redder than 2.8 or be non - detections ( @xmath85 ) in the @xmath30-band to exclude lower - redshift interlopers .",
    "appendix a provides a justification for the @xmath84 color cut by comparing it with a number of intrinsically red galaxies uncovered in the cdf - south ( table  2 ) . to guard against spurious sources that come in the form of low - surface brightness variations in the background ( appendix d4.4 )",
    ", we required that objects in the hudf be at least @xmath86 detections in a 0.3@xmath87-diameter aperture .",
    "the detection requirement was increased to 4 and 4.5 @xmath61 for the hudf - ps and goods fields , respectively , to cope with the likely larger non - gaussian signatures present in the smaller exposure stacks that comprise these data .",
    "point sources brighter than some fiducial @xmath16-band magnitude ( 26.8 for goods fields , 27.5 for the hudf - ps , and 28.4 for the hudf ) were removed at this stage ( point sources were defined to have sextractor stellarity parameters @xmath88 ) .",

    "while @xmath81 color criterion is quite effective at isolating @xmath431 galaxies , a more robust selection is possible using the @xmath126-band fluxes .",

    "however , we can not simply demand that our @xmath1 candidates have no detectable ( @xmath85 ) @xmath126-band flux .",
    "this is because of the residual transmission at @xmath433 ( incomplete gunn - peterson trough ) which allows several of the brighter @xmath1 galaxies in the hudf to show faint @xmath126-band detections .",
    "therefore , we must arrive at some criterion which allows for some @xmath126-band flux in our @xmath1 selection , but not too much .",
    "the criterion we settled upon was @xmath434 color cut ( figure  a1 ) for our high redshift selection .",

    ", we measure the rms variance in apertures of different sizes , and then find an rms noise level and noise kernel that reproduced the observed variation in rms noise as a function of aperture size .",
    "the best fit noise levels were then used to scale the weight ( inverse variance ) maps provided with the hudf ( beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) or obtained from our `` apsis '' software ( blakeslee et al.2003 ) .    by comparing the weight maps on our deeper data with that desired for our degradation experiments",

    "we then made simple realizations of this noise and smoothed these realizations with the appropriate noise kernels to obtain the correct correlation properties .",

    "to assess the completeness , contamination rate , and flux measurements in our shallower fields relative to our deeper fields , we degraded our deeper fields ( hudf and hudf - ps ) to the depths of our shallower fields ( hudf - ps and goods ) in a series of experiments .",
    "these degradations provide a very natural way of estimating the effect that photometric scatter has on both our selection and measurement process .",
    "experiments included degrading the udf to the depth of the first hudf parallel ( hudfp1 ) , degrading the udf to the depth of the second hudf parallel ( hudfp2 ) , degrading the udf to the depth of the goods fields , degrading hudfp1 to the depth of the goods fields , and degrading hudfp2 to the depth of the goods fields .",
    "each degradation was repeated 10 times to minimize the dependence on any particular noise realization . to maximize realism",
    ", we ensured that the pixel - by - pixel weight maps of the degraded images were identical to those of the shallower fields .",
    "this was of particular interest for the hudf - ps (  2.2 ) because the depth in these fields varies by @xmath56 mag across the field of view .",
    "then , @xmath0-dropouts were selected using the selection criteria of our shallower fields .",
    "our degradation procedure is detailed in appendix b.    objects obviously associated with the diffraction wings of stars or bright elliptical galaxies were eliminated to mimic the selection procedure used for the main catalog ( where similar spurious sources were eliminated ) .",
    "objects selected by this procedure were divided into two categories : contaminants and @xmath1 objects .",
    "objects with @xmath84 colors bluer than 2.8 were classified as contaminants and objects with @xmath84 colors redder than 2.8 were classified as @xmath1 objects ( see appendix a ) . in a few cases , where it was clear that the @xmath126-band photometry was contaminated by a nearby foreground object , we reclassified what would otherwise be labeled a contaminant as a @xmath1 @xmath0-dropout . despite some ambiguity regarding the exact split between the two categories , our results are not expected to depend on the exact split chosen .",
    "more stringent @xmath84 cuts will result in a higher contamination rate for the shallower field , but this will be offset by a lower selection volume .",
    "this section describes the corrections we applied to the surface densities of @xmath0-dropouts derived from our shallower data in order to put them on a similar footing to our deeper hudf data .",
    "these corrections compensate for the greater incompleteness levels , flux biases , and contamination expected to be present in the shallower data .",
    "we start by looking at what can be said about the completeness levels and flux biases by degrading the available data .",

    "an illustration of this is provided in figure  d1 for the three fields under study .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the distribution of @xmath0-dropouts in the hudf , hudf - ps , and goods fields do not extend much to the upper - right of the three 50% completeness contours shown . as a result",

    "are overplotted for the three fields and assume an @xmath446 surface brightness profile .",
    "these limits were determined by laying down galaxies of different sizes and total magnitudes on a noise frame and then attempting to recover them with our selection procedure (  3.1 ) . by comparing the size - magnitude distribution of objects from our deeper surveys with our shallower surveys , it is obvious that significant incompleteness only sets in beyond @xmath443 in the goods fields and @xmath444 in the hudf - ps .",
    "a more detailed quantification of these biases is provided in the text and table  d3 ( see also bouwens et al .",
    "2004b).,width=384 ]    perhaps the most model - independent way of estimating the incompleteness in our shallower fields relative to the hudf is to degrade the deeper data sets to the same s / n as these shallower fields and then repeat the selection procedure .",
    "the very similar psfs , pixel sizes , and passbands for all data sets considered here make this a straightforward process .",

    "<S> density evolution ( @xmath12 ) is ruled out at @xmath1399.99% confidence . despite large changes in the lf , </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity density at @xmath1 is similar ( @xmath14 ) to that at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> changes in the mean uv color of galaxies from @xmath1 to @xmath5 suggest an evolution in dust content , indicating the true evolution is substantially larger : at @xmath1 the star formation rate density is just @xmath15% of the @xmath5 value . </S>",
