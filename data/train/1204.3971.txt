    "silicene is a monolayer of silicon atoms forming a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice@xcite .",
    "it has a relatively large spin - orbit ( so ) gap , and its intrinsic property is the buckled structureshiraishi , ciraci , liuprl owing to a large ionic radius of silicon .",
    "silicene has richer physical properties than graphene due to this property .",
    "first of all , it is a topological insulator , characterized by a full insulating gap in the bulk and helical gapless edges@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the band structure is controllable by applying the electric field @xmath1 to a silicene sheet@xcite : it has been shown that silicene undergoes a topological phase transition from a topological insulator to a band insulator as @xmath2 increases .",
    "it is a semimetal at the critical field @xmath3 due to its linear dispersion relation .",
    "it has many attractive and remarkable properties@xcite .",
    "silicene may be the most promising material now available as a topological insulator@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the band structure of bilayer silicene , which was manufactured@xcite experimentally only recently . though bilayer silicene has a trivial @xmath0 topological charge , we show that its physical properties are more akin to those of a topological insulator than those of a band insulator .",
    "when we switch off the rashba so interaction ( @xmath4 ) and the interlayer so interaction ( @xmath5 ) , bilayer silicene shares the same edge - mode properties with a topological insulator : it has a full insulating gap in the bulk and helical gapless edges .",
    "however , helical gapless edge modes are not topologically protected because of a possible mixing between the two gapless modes present in each edge .",
    "indeed , a small gap opens when these interactions are taken into account . nevertheless , the physical properties are very much similar to those of a topological insulator .",
    "this is particularly so under electric field , as we shall soon see .",
    "it would be reasonable to call such a system a quasi - topological insulator .",
    "here we recall a recent proposal of bilayer graphene@xcite with rather unphysical parameters for study of topological insulator .",
    "the model hamiltonian is very similar to ours , and there are much in common .",
    "nevertheless , the great merit of our theory is that silicene is a realistic material , and any experimental test on our results is feasible .",
    "furthermore , it is remarkable that the band structure is controllable by applying the electric field to bilayer silicene .",
    "just as monolayer silicene undergoes a phase transition from a topological insulator to a band insulator at a certain electric field@xcite , bilayer silicene makes a transition from a quasi - topological insulator to a simple band insulator beyond a certain critical field .",
    "it is a metal at the critical field .",
    "there exists also a new feature .",
    "we find that the band gap closes a few times when we increase electric field , which is absent in the case of monolayer silicene .",
    "it is a trigonal warping effect .",
    "bilayer silicene has an additional degree of freedom how to stack two buckled monolayer silicenes .",
    "there are four types of stacking even if we concentrate on the bernal ( ab ) stacking ( fig.1 ) .",
    "for example , the forward stacking has an electron - hole symmetry but the backward stacking does not .",
    "it is possible to determine the type of stacking of a sample by experimental measurement .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the hamiltonian for bilayer silicene and study the band structure of a nanoribbon .",
    "we point out by numerical calculation that the edge modes are almost gapless and helical though bilayer silicene has a trivial @xmath6 topological charge . in section",
    "iii we derive the effective dirac theory to describe the low - energy physics around the k and k points . in section",
    "iv we investigate the band structure under homogeneous electric field based on the effective dirac theory .",
    "bilayer silicene is shown to become metallic at the critical electric field , though the band structure depends considerably on the type of stacking of two buckled silicenes .",
    "silicene consists of a honeycomb lattice of silicon atoms with two sublattices made of a sites and b sites . due to the buckled structure",
    "the two sublattice planes are separated by a distance , which we denote by @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "the states near the fermi energy are @xmath9 orbitals residing near the k and k points at opposite corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "we refer to the k or k point also as the k@xmath10 point with the valley index @xmath11 .",
    "the monolayer silicene system is described by the four - band second - nearest - neighbor tight binding model@xcite ,    @xmath12    where @xmath13 creates an electron with spin polarization @xmath14 at site @xmath15 , and @xmath16 run over all the nearest / second - nearest neighbor hopping sites .",

    "the second term represents the effective so coupling with @xmath18mev , where @xmath19 is the pauli matrix of spin , and @xmath20 if the second - nearest - neighboring hopping is anticlockwise and @xmath21 if it is clockwise with respect to the positive z axis .",

    ", @xmath27 in the top layer is indicated by solid line , while bond connecting sites @xmath28 , @xmath29 in the bottom layer by dashed line .",
    "the interlalyer interactions are indicated by arrows together with the couplings @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we model a bilayer silicene as two coupled buckled hexagonal lattices including inequivalent sites @xmath33 in the top layer and @xmath34 in the bottom layer , respectively .",
    "these are arranged according to bernal ( @xmath35-@xmath29 ) stacking , as illustrated in fig.[figillustbilayer ] .",
    "there are four types of bernal stacking in bilayer silicene , since the top and bottom layers can be buckled upward and downward independently .",
    "irrespective of the type , the bilayer silicene system is described by the eight - band second - nearest - neighbor tight binding model,@xmath36@xmath37where @xmath38 is the hamiltonian ( [ basichamil ] ) for the top ( t ) or bottom ( b ) layer ; @xmath39 is the interlayer hamiltonian , where the first term is the nearest - neighbor interlayer vertical hopping between @xmath40 sites of the top layer and @xmath29 sites of the bottom layer with the coupling @xmath41 , and the second term is the next - nearest - neighbor interlayer hopping between @xmath27 sites of the top layer and @xmath28 sites of the bottom layer with the coupling @xmath31 .",
    "there are three @xmath31 hopping vectors from one site , as implies the trigonal symmetry of the bilayer system .",
    "the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath31 depend on the type of bernal stacking , but we expect @xmath42 in all of them .",
    "the third term describes the interlayer so interaction@xcite with the coupling @xmath43 .",
    "its magnitude would be the same order as that in graphene ( @xmath44mev ) .     in unit of @xmath45 .",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath46 .",
    "( a ) when the rashba and interlayer interactions are switched off ( @xmath47 ) , there are eight bands crossing the gap , which are edge modes .",

    "the gapless edge modes are helical .",
    "( b ) when these interactions are switched on ( @xmath50 ) , a crossing turns out to be an anticrossing due to a spin mixing , as induces a small gap .",
    "the edge modes are almost helical except for the anticrossing point . in fact , spin mixing occurs only in the vicinity of the anticrossing point .",
    "we have taken @xmath51 and @xmath52 for illustration to emphasize the gap.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    it is readily shown that the band structure of the hamiltonian ( [ blg ] ) is gapped , and hence bilayer silicene is an insulator . to study what type of insulator it is ,",
    "we have analyzed the energy bands of a bilayer silicene nanoribbon based on the tight - binding model ( [ blg ] ) , whose result we give in fig.[figbiribbonband ] .",
    "the band structure consists of the bulk modes and the edge modes , where the bulk modes are gapped .",
    "there exists an intriguing feature with respect to the edge modes .",
    "when we switch off the rashba and interlayer interactions ( @xmath53 ) there emerge eight helical zero - energy modes in the edges [ fig.[figbiribbonband](a ) ] .",
    "this is what we expect since the number is simply twice as much as that in monolayer siliceneliuprl , ezawanjp .",
    "namely , four helical zero - energy modes arise from each monolayer silicene .",
    "indeed , according to the bulk - boundary correspondence rule , and since the chern number of the bilayer system is shown to be twice that of the monolayer , the number of helical edge states should also be double .",
    "however , when we switch on these interactions ( @xmath54 ) , a spin mixing occurs , as turns a two - band crossing into a two - band anticrossing and opens a small gap for the edge modes [ fig.[figbiribbonband](b ) ] .",
    "this makes a sharp contrast to the monolayer case , where the gapless edge modes are protected topologically against perturbations . despite",
    "each layer behaves as a topological insulator , an even number of such layers renders the overall system topologically trivial that is characterized by a vanishing @xmath0 charge .",
    "the topological triviality of a bilayer system may be understood as follows . in the bilayer system , backscattering between channels at the same edge moving in opposite directions with opposite spins is not forbidden , in contrast to the case for the monolayer system .",
    "we note that a similar behavior has been pointed out in bilayer graphene@xcite .    nevertheless , the properties of bilayer silicene are more akin to those of a topological insulator than those of a band insulator . when @xmath53 the edge modes are purely helical , which is one of the characteristic feature of a topological insulator .",
    "when @xmath55 a spin mixing occurs only around the anticrossing point , and the edge modes are almost helical away from the point , as we can confirm numerically .",
    "as we shall soon show , by applying a critical electric field , the gap becomes precisely zero at the k and k points : bilayer silicene becomes a metal due to a parabolic dispersion , just as monolayer silicene becomes a semimetal@xcite due to a linear dispersion .",
    "it is reasonable to call such an object a quasi - topological insulator .",
    "we analyze the physics of electrons near the fermi energy based on the low - energy effective hamiltonian derived from the tight binding model ( blg ) .",

    "actually , @xmath67 and @xmath43 are small constants with respect to the other parameters .",
    "hence , it is a good approximation to set @xmath68 in most cases . in what follow , although we carry out numerical analysis by including the nonzero effects of @xmath69 and @xmath43 , we develop an analytic formalism by assuming @xmath70 .",
    "it enables us to make a simple and clear physical picture on the basis of analytic formulas .",
    "for instance , the spin @xmath71 becomes a good quantum number in this simplification , where the spin - chirality is given by @xmath72 .",
    "we can always check the validity of the approximation numerically .",
    "we rewrite down the hamiltonian @xmath73 explicitly  in the basis @xmath74 , @xmath75where the diagonal blocks are @xmath76@xmath77while the off - diagonal blocks are @xmath78with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "we have introduced this parameter for a later convenience , though it is irrelevant here .",
    "we make a further simplification of the theory by reducing the @xmath83 hamiltonian to the @xmath84 hamiltonian , which is valid as the effective two - band hamiltonian for the lower energy bands@xcite .",

    "we take a bilayer silicene sheet on the @xmath97-plane , and apply the electric field @xmath1 perpendicular to the plane .",
    "it generates a staggered sublattice potential @xmath98 between silicon atoms at a sites and b sites in a single silicene sheet , and also a staggered sublattice potential @xmath99 between two silicene sheets .",

    "silicon atoms prefer having the neighboring atoms in regular tetrahedron directions , and hence the case 1 seems most likely .",
