    "high counting - rate detectors capable of efficient single photon sensing in the infrared region are needed for several applications in different fields , including high - bandwidth interplanetary optical communications , test of high - speed semiconductor circuits , quantum optics and quantum communications @xcite .",
    "nanowire superconducting single photon detectors ( sspds ) @xcite are interesting candidates for these requirements .",
    "so far , high - sensitivity ultrafast sspds have been fabricated only on 4 nm thick nbn films grown on sapphire substrates at high temperatures ( typically @xmath1c ) @xcite .",
    "this significantly limits the integration of sspds with advanced optical structures ( e.g. waveguides and microcavities ) and read - out electronics , typically realized on other substrates and not compatible with these deposition temperatures .",
    "for instance , high reflectivity dbr realized on gaas do not withstand such temperatures due to as outgassing @xcite .",
    "very recently , fabrication of sspds on mgo at room temperature has been reported , but their quantum efficiency ( _ qe _ ) is very low @xcite . in an effort to develop an exportable technology ,",
    "we show that high performance nbn sspds can be implemented on different substrates ( e.g. mgo ) and at lower deposition temperatures ( @xmath2c ) , which opens the way to monolithic integration .",
    "nbn films ranging from 150 nm to 3 nm in thickness were deposited on epitaxial - quality single crystal mgo @xmath3 substrates by current controlled dc magnetron sputtering from a nb target ( 5 cm diameter , 99.95% purity ) in a mixture of ar ( 99.9997% purity ) and n@xmath4  ( 99.999% purity ) .",
    "the background pressure was in the low @xmath5 torr range .",
    "the distance between target and substrate was fixed at the maximum allowed by our system ( 85 mm ) to maximize film uniformity . in order to control the thickness of ultrathin films , the deposition rate _",
    "r _ was kept in the few  / s range , which fixed the plasma current at @xmath6ma .",
    "low total pressures @xmath7 ( in the few mtorr range ) were used , resulting in power densities of the order of 10w/@xmath8 .",
    "the high sputtering energy allowed to promote the growth of high quality nbn films at a substrate temperature as low as @xmath9c . following a well established procedure @xcite",
    ", the superconducting  properties of nbn films were optimized studying the effects of @xmath7 and composition of reactive gas on film structural and electrical properties . for every @xmath7",
    "the superconducting  critical temperature @xmath10  showed a maximum as a function of nitrogen partial pressure @xmath11 , which was varied within the limits determined by the requirement to produce the nbn superconducting  @xmath12 phase @xcite .",
    "decreasing @xmath7 improved the quality of nbn films : an increase in the maximum of @xmath10  and a decrease in the superconducting  transition width @xmath13@xmath10  and residual resistivity ratio ( the ratio between the resistivity at 300k and at 20k , @xmath14 ) were observed .",

    "electrical contact was realized by a cooled 50@xmath21 microwave probe attached to a micromanipulator , and connected by a coaxial line to the room - temperature circuitry .",

    "the voltage offset is due to thermoelectric effects ( electrical contact from room temperature to the device is realized through junctions between different metals at different temperatures , so a voltage is created due to the seebeck effect ) .",

    "after the current through the device exceeds the superconducting  critical current @xmath29 , circuit - controlled relaxation oscillations are observed until , with increasing voltage , the circuit switches along the load line to the hotspot plateau .",
    "finally , at high voltages , the extension of the hotspot approaches the total length of the nanowire and does not grow any further , so ohmic behavior is observed . the critical current density @xmath30  was estimated from the measured value of @xmath29  and the entire geometrical cross - section of the meander .",
    "@xmath30  at 4.2k varied in the 2 - 4 ma/@xmath8 range , which is a state of the art value .",
    "the ten devices which showed the highest @xmath30  in each chip were mounted on a cryogenic dipstick and optically tested in an liquid he bath at 4.2k .",
    "this selection criterion relies on the fact that the most constricted segment of a nanowire determines its @xmath29 .",
    "devices with a constriction ( which show a low @xmath29 ) are biased well below @xmath30  in most of the meander length , and thus they have a lower quantum efficiency ( _ qe _ ) .",
    "bias current was supplied through the dc port of a 10mhz-4ghz bandwidth bias - t connected to the voltage bias circuit already described , avoiding the latching effects associated with the current bias .",
    "the value for the bias resistor ( @xmath26 ) was chosen to attain the highest value for the bias current @xmath31 with respect to critical current @xmath29  ( dashed line in fig .",
    "3 ) . increasing @xmath25 , the noise on @xmath31  due to the voltage source",
    "is reduced , but the dc load line ( dotted line ) become less steep .",
    "consequently , for a given bias current @xmath32 it may intersect the i - v at two points , in the superconducting  region and in the hotspot  plateau , so that the device permanently switches from the superconducting  to the dissipative state .",
    "the ac port of the bias - t was connected through a 4db attenuator to the series of two 18bb gain , 20mhz-3ghz bandwidth , low - noise amplifiers .",
    "the amplified signal was then fed to either a 1ghz bandwidth fast oscilloscope for time resolved measurements or a 300mhz counter for statistical analysis .",
    "the devices were optically probed using 50ps wide , 25mhz repetition rate pulses at 1.3@xmath19 m wavelength from a fiber - pigtailed , gain - switched laser diode .",
