    "@xcite , see also  @xcite for a more recent summary of the status .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the method which is used to compute @xmath20 and @xmath21 is based on the dimensional recurrence relation and analyticity with respect to space - time dimensionality @xmath1 ( the so - called `` dra method '' ) and has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite this method has been applied for the first time to the case with more than one master integral in a sector .",
    "some integrals taken from families of integrals for the three - loop static quark potential and denoted in  @xcite by @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig::3mis](d ) ) have been calculated .",
    "note that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the only nontrivial integrals entering the right - hand side of the dimensional recurrence relation for @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , in principle , the results of ref .  @xcite make the calculation of @xmath21 straightforward",
    ".    however , the numerical issues related to the calculation of contributions to the inhomogeneous terms proportional to @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the right - hand side of dimensional recurrence relations for @xmath21 are quite involved .",
    "the most complicated part of this contribution has the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are a row - vector , a @xmath33 matrix and a column - vector , respectively .",
    "their components are rational functions of the variable @xmath34 . in order to calculate the sums in eq .",
    "( [ eq::t ] ) without nested loops , we apply the standard trick of the dra method , see ref .",
    "namely , let us denote @xmath35 where @xmath36 . then @xmath37 using eq .  , the function @xmath38 can be calculated for given @xmath39 in one loop if one takes into account the recurrence relation @xmath40 .",
    "now we note that @xmath38 satisfies the recurrence relation @xmath41 therefore , in order to calculate consecutive terms of the sum in eq .",
    "we need to use eq .   only once , and then use the recurrence relation",
    ". however , the price we have to pay is much higher than for scalar sums .",
    "this is connected with the multiplication by the inverse matrix @xmath42 .",
    "for @xmath43 the elements of @xmath31 are of order unity , while its determinant tends to @xmath44 . due to this fact ,",
    "the multiplication by @xmath45 involves large cancellations which result in rapid precision loss .",
    "for example , using a precision of 7000 digits in the initial expression we obtain only about 370 digits in the final result .",
    "besides , it appears that the sum over @xmath46 in the definition of @xmath38 converges very slowly , with the summand behaving as @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) at large @xmath46 .",
    "so , in order to obtain the high - precision numerical result suitable for using pslq  @xcite , one has to apply the matrix analog of the convergence acceleration algorithm described in ref .",
    "in particular , one needs to know the exponent @xmath49 of the power - like decay .",
    "this appears to be possible thanks to ref .",
    "@xcite , where a method for finding the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of recurrence relations was developed .",
    "once we dealt with these numerical issues , we have obtained the result @xmath50 where @xmath51 is riemann s zeta function evaluated at @xmath46 and @xmath52 @xmath53 are multiple zeta values given by @xmath54    in order to apply the dra method to @xmath20 , one has to take into account that the dimensional recurrence relation for @xmath20 contains now two non - trivial integrals denoted in  @xcite by @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "so , in a first step one has to apply the dra method to these two integrals .",
    "fortunately , they can be calculated along the same lines as @xmath26 and @xmath27 from which they differ only by the @xmath57 prescription in one of the linear denominators .",
    "in particular , the summing factor has the same form as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see eq . ( 4.14 ) of that paper ) . plugging the results for @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the dimensional recurrence relation for @xmath20 and applying the dra method ,",
    "we obtain @xmath58 note that the @xmath59 terms of @xmath21 and @xmath20 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq::i16 ] ) and  ( [ eq::i11 ] ) are not needed for @xmath60}$ ] .",
    "we nevertheless provide these results to demonstrate the powerfulness of the dra method .    in principle",

    "its perturbative part is obtained from the exchange of soft gluons which are conveniently considered in the framework of non - relativistic qcd .",
    "numerical results for the three - loop potential , which have entered a number of physical observables , have been obtained eight years ago by two independent groups  @xcite .",
    "the obtained precision has been sufficient for all physical applications where @xmath19 entered as a building block .",
    "however , from the aesthetic point of view it is important to obtain analytic results for higher order quantum corrections .",
    "this has been achieved in this paper .",
    "we have obtained analytic results for the three - loop corrections to the singlet and octet potential which are presented in sections  [ sec::sing ] and  [ sec::oct ] , respectively .",
