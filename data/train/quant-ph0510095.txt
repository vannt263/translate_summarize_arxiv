    "discussions of the foundations of quantum mechanics have been largely concerned with three related foundational questions which are often intermingled , but which i believe should be kept apart :    \\1 . a semi - empirical question : is quantum mechanics complete ?",
    "in other words , do we have to supplement or restrict the formalism by some additional assumptions ?",
    "\\2 . a mathematical - logical question : what are the constraints imposed by quantum mechanics on its possible alternatives ? this is where all the famous `` no - hidden - variables ''  theorems belong .",
    "\\3 . a philosophical question : assuming that quantum mechanics is complete , what then does it say about reality ?    by _ quantum mechanics _",
    "i mean the hilbert space formalism , including the dynamical rule for the quantum state given by schrdinger s equation , born s rule for calculating probabilities , and the association of measurements with hermitian operators .",
    "these elements seem to me to be the core of the ( nonrelativistic ) theory .",
    "i shall be concerned mainly with the philosophical question .",
    "consequently , for the purpose of this paper the validity and completeness of the hilbert space formalism is assumed .",
    "by making this assumption i do not wish to prejudge the answer to the first question .",
    "it seems to me dogmatic to accept the completeness claim , since no one can predict what future theories will look like . at the same time",
    "i think it is also dogmatic to reject completeness .",
    "present day alternatives to quantum mechanics , be they collapse theories like grw @xcite , or non - collapse theories like bohm s @xcite , all suffer from very serious shortcomings .",
    "however , one can not ignore the strong philosophical motivation behind the search for alternatives .",
    "these are , in particular , two conceptual assumptions , or perhaps dogmas that propel this search : the first is j. s. bell s dictum that the concept of measurement should not be taken as fundamental , but should rather be defined in terms of more basic processes @xcite .",
    "the second assumption is that the quantum state is a real physical entity , and that denying its reality turns quantum theory into a mere instrument for predictions .",
    "this last assumption runs very quickly into the measurement problem .",
    "hence , one is forced either to adopt an essentially non - relativistic alternative to quantum mechanics ( e.g. bohm without collapse , grw with it ) ; or to adopt the baroque many worlds interpretation which has no collapse and assumes that all measurement outcomes are realized .",
    "in addition , the first assumption delegates secondary importance to measurements , with the result that the uncertainty relations are all but forgotten . they are accepted as empirical facts , of course ; but after everything is said and done we still do not know why it is impossible to measure position and momentum at the same time . in bohm s theory , for example",
    ", the commutation relations are adopted by fiat even on the level of individual processes , but are denied any fundamental role in the theory .",
    "my approach is traditional and goes back to heisenberg , bohr and von neumann .",
    "it takes the uncertainty relations as the centerpiece that demarcates between the classical and quantum domain .",
    "this position is mathematically expressed by taking the hilbert space , or more precisely , the lattice of its closed subspaces , as the structure that represents the `` elements of reality '' in quantum theory .",
    "the quantum state is a derived entity , it is a device for the bookkeeping of probabilities . the general outlook presented here",
    "is thus related to the school of quantum information theory , and can be seen as an attempt to tie it to the broader questions of interpretation .",
    "i strive to explain in what way quantum information is different from classical information , and , perhaps why .",
    "the main point is that the hilbert space formalism is a `` logic of partial belief '' in the sense of frank ramsey @xcite .",
    "in such a logic one usually distinguishes between possible `` states of the world '' ( in savage s terminology @xcite ) , and the probability function .",
    "the former represent an objective reality and the latter our uncertainty about it . in the quantum context",
    "possible states of the world are represented by the closed subspaces of the hilbert space while the probability is derived from the @xmath1 function by born s rule . in order to avoid confusion between the objective sense of _ possible state _ ( subspace ) , and @xmath2- which is also traditionally called the state- we shall refer to the subspaces as _ events _ , or _",
    "possible events _ , _ _  _ _ or _ possible outcomes _ ( of experiments ) . to repeat , my purpose is to defend the position that the hilbert space formalism is essentially a new theory of probability , and to try to grasp the implications of this structure for reality .",
    "the initial plausibility of this approach stems from the observation that quantum mechanics uses a method for calculating probabilities which is different from that of classical probability theory .",
    "moreover , in order to force quantum probability to conform to the classical mold we have to add objects ( variables , events ) and dynamical laws over and above those of quantum theory .",
    "this state of affairs calls for a philosophical analysis because the theory of probability is a theory of inference and , as such , is a guide to the formation of rational expectations .",
    "the relation between the above stated purpose and the completeness assumption should be stressed again .",
    "we can always avoid the radical view of probability by adopting a non - local , contextual hidden variables theory such as bohm s .",
    "but then i believe , the philosophical point is missed . it is like taking steven weinberg s position on space - time in general relativity :",
    "there is no non - flat riemannian geometry , only a gravitational field defined on a flat space - time that appears as if it gives rise to geometry @xcite .",
    "i think that weinberg s point and also bohm s theory are justified only to the extent that they yield new discoveries in physics ( as weinberg certainly hoped ) .",
    "so far they havent .",
    "jeffrey bub was my thesis supervisor over a quarter of a century ago , and from him i have iearnt the mysteries of quantum mechanics and quantum logic @xcite .",
    "for quite a while our attempts to grasp the meaning of the theory diverged , but now seem to converge again @xcite .",
    "it is a great pleasure for me to contribute to this volume in honor of a teacher and a dear friend .",
    "traditionally a theory of probability distinguishes between the set of possible events  ( called the algebra of events , or the set of states of nature , or the set of possible outcomes ) and the probability measure defined on them . in the bayesian approach what constitutes a possible event",
    "is dictated by nature , and the probability of the event represents the degree of belief we attach to its occurrence .",
    "this distinction , however , is not sharp ; what is possible is also a matter of judgment in the sense that an event is judged impossible if it gets probability zero in all circumstances . in the present case we deal with physical events , and",
    "what is impossible is therefore dictated by the best available physical theory .",
    "hence , probability considerations enter into the structure of the set of possible events .",
    "we represent by @xmath3 the equivalence class of all events which our physical theory declares to be utterly impossible ( never occur , and therefore always get probability zero ) and by @xmath4 what is certain ( always occur , and therefore get probability one ) .",
    "similarly , the _ identity _ of events which is encoded by the structure also involves judgments of probability in the sense that _ identical events always have the same probability .",
    "_ this is the meaning of accepting a structure as an algebra of events _ in a probability space_. an important example is the following : consider two measurements @xmath5 , @xmath6 , which can be performed together , so that @xmath7=0 $ ] ; and suppose that @xmath5 has the possible outcomes @xmath8 , and @xmath6 the possible outcomes @xmath9 .",
    "denote by @xmath10 the event `` the outcome of the measurement of @xmath5 is @xmath11 '' , and similarly for @xmath12 .  now consider the identity : @xmath13 this is the distributivity rule which holds in this case  as it also holds in all classical cases .",
    "this means , for instance , that if @xmath5 represents the roll of a die with six possible outcomes and @xmath6 the flip of a coin with two possible outcomes , then eq ( [ 1 ] ) is trivial .",
    "consequently the probability of the left hand side of eq ( [ 1 ] ) equals the probability of the right hand side , for every probability measure .    in the quantum mechanical context",
    "this observation has further implications . if @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath14 , are observables such that @xmath7=0 $ ] , and @xmath15=0 $ ] but @xmath16\\neq0 $ ]",
    ". then the identity @xmath17 holds , where @xmath18 are the possible outcomes of @xmath14 . by the rule _",
    "identical events always have the same probability _ we conclude that the probabilities of all three expressions in eq ( [ 2 ] ) are equal .",
    "this is _ the principle of the non - contextuality of probability_. there is a large body of literature which attempts to justify this principle . for why should we apply the same probability to @xmath19 in the @xmath20 context as in the @xmath21 context ?",
    "if this is a good question in the quantum domain it should be an equally good question in the classical regime . for consider eq ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath5 representing the throw of a die , and @xmath6 the flip of a coin .",
    "now think of two contexts : in one we just flip the coin without rolling the die ; in the other we do both",
    ". why should the probability of @xmath19 be the same in both contexts ?",
    "( regardless of our judgment about the dependence , or independence of the events ) . by the very act of putting the outcomes of the two procedures coin flipping  and",
    "die throwing  in the same _ probability _ space ( the product space ) we are ipso facto assuming eq ( [ 1 ] ) as an identity in a probability space which implies equality of probabilities .",
    "although routinely made , this assumption ultimately represents an empirical judgment .",
    "counterexamples are hard to come by , and are usually quite contrived .    my proposal to take the hilbert space formalism as a ramsey type logic of partial belief involves the same commitment .",
    "hence , in the following i _ assume _ that the @xmath3 of the algebra of subspaces represents impossibility ( zero probability in all circumstances ) @xmath4 represents certainty ( probability one in all circumstances ) , and the identities such as eq ( [ 1 ] ) and eq ( [ 2 ] ) represent identity of probability in all circumstances .",
    "this is the sense in which the lattice of closed subspaces of the hilbert space is taken as an algebra of events .",
    "i take these judgments to be natural extensions of the classical case ; a posteriori , they are all justified empirically .      in their 1936 seminal paper the logic of quantum mechanics  garrett birkhoff and john von neumann @xcite formulated the quantum logical program .",
    "their strategy was to take the following steps :    \\1 .",
    "identify the quantum structure which is the analogue of the event structure of classical statistical mechanics .",
    "distill a set of principles underlying this structure and formulate them as axioms .",
    "show that the quantum structure is , in some sense , the model of the axioms .",
    "birkhoff and von neumann identified the quantum event structure ( which they called `` quantum logic '' ) as the algebra of closed subspaces of a hilbert space . in the rest of this section",
    "i shall review the efforts to accomplish steps 2 and 3 of their program , that is , begin with the axioms and generate the structure . the elements in the structure we shall refer to as events , or outcomes  ( meaning outcomes of gambles or of measurements ) or  sometimes loosely as `` propositions '' ( meaning propositions that describe the events ) .",
    "notice that the axioms below are shared by both classical and quantum systems , with the exception of the last axiom .",
    "it should also be noted that i do not claim that this structure is _ logic _ in the same sense that the predicate calculus or intuitionistic logic are .",
    "( nor do i think that birkhoff and von neumann made such a claim ) .",
    "a proposition that describes a possible event in a probability space is of a rather special kind .",
    "it is constrained by the requirement that there should be a viable procedure to determine whether the event occurs , so that a gamble that involves it can be unambiguously decided .",
    "this means that we exclude many propositions .",
    "for example , propositions that describe past events of which we have only a partial record , or no record at all .",
    "we also exclude undecidable mathematical propositions such as the continuum hypothesis , and many other propositions that form a part of the standard conception of logic .",
    "our structure is logic  only insofar as it is the event component of a logic of partial belief .",
    "we use small latin letters @xmath22 , to designate events , and denote by @xmath23  the totality of events .",
    "@xmath24  stands for intersection ,  @xmath25  for union ,  and implication is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "finally , @xmath27  denotes the complement of @xmath28 . the certain event is denoted by @xmath4  and the null event by @xmath3 .",
    "these are the axioms :    * s1 * @xmath29 .    * s2 * @xmath30if @xmath31  and @xmath32  then @xmath33 .",
    "* s3 *  if @xmath31  and @xmath34  then @xmath35 .",

    "* o4 * @xmath30orthomodularity if @xmath31  then @xmath50 .",
    "axiom o4 is sometimes replaced by a stronger axiom :    * o4 * * @xmath30modularity if @xmath33  then @xmath51 .",
    "the axioms * s1 * -*s6 * , * o1 * -*o4 * are true in the classical system of propositional logic or , more precisely , in the lindenbaum - tarski algebra of such a logic , when we interpret the operations as logical connectives . the rest of the axioms are more specific to the physical context .",
    "* h1 *  atomism : if @xmath52  then there is an atom @xmath53  such that @xmath54  and @xmath55 . here by an _ atom _ we mean an element @xmath56  such that @xmath57 entails @xmath58  or @xmath59 .    *",
    "h2 *  covering property : for all atoms @xmath53  and all elements @xmath28  if @xmath60  then @xmath61  entails @xmath62  or @xmath63 .",
    "atomism and the covering property are introduced to ensure that every element of the lattice is a union of atoms .",
    "the atoms , whose existence is guaranteed by * h1 * , are maximally informative propositions . in the classical case",
    "they correspond to points in the phase space ( or rather , singleton subsets of phase space ) ; in the quantum case they correspond to one dimensional subspaces of the hilbert space .",
    "* h3 *  completeness : if @xmath64  then @xmath65  and @xmath66  exist .",
    "usually we do not assume such a strong axiom in the classical physical case .",
    "there , the algebra of possible events is the @xmath67-algebra of lebesgue measurable subsets of phase space , which is assumed to be closed only under countable unions and intersections .",
    "however , axiom * h3 * is _ consistent _ with the classical physical event space .",
    "it is known that in some models of set theory every set of reals is lebesgue measurable @xcite .",
    "in such models * h3 * will automatically be satisfied for the lebesgue algebra in phase space .",
    "this means that no substantial difference between the classical and quantum case arises from * h3*.    the one single axiom that separates the quantum from the classical domain is    * h4 *  irreducibility : if @xmath68  satisfies for all @xmath69  @xmath70  then @xmath71  or @xmath72 .",
    "this last axiom is non - classical in the following sense : there is only one boolean algebra which is irreducible , the trivial algebra @xmath73 . in classical physics",
    "the set of events is a large boolean algebra .",
    "in fact , it is _ totally reducible _ :  for all @xmath28  and all @xmath68  we have @xmath70 .",
    "so consider the case @xmath74    the intuitive meaning of eq ( [ 3 ] )  is that the events @xmath28  and @xmath68  are _ incompatible _ , that is , can not be the outcomes of a single experiment .",
    "thus , axiom * h4 * is the formal expression of indeterminacy .",
    "later we shall see how eq([3 ] ) entails a more familiar uncertainty relation between the probabilities of @xmath28  and @xmath68 . for the sake of illustration , at this stage , consider the case in which @xmath28 and @xmath68 are atoms .",
    "one implication of eq([3 ] ) is that _ there are non orthogonal atoms_. so consider some measurement in which @xmath28 is the _ actual _ outcome , and the other possible outcomes are @xmath75 , @xmath76, ... etc .",
    ", all orthogonal to @xmath28 , so that @xmath68 is not among them .",
    "this means that after the measurement is performed we gain no knowledge as to whether @xmath68 is the case or not .",
    "this state of affairs would not be very surprising were it not for the fact that @xmath28 and @xmath68 are atomic events ; but in this case it seems to imply that _ there is no fact of the matter as to whether _ @xmath68 _ _  is the case or not__. in other words , no certain record about the possible outcome @xmath68 is obtainable , in principle , while we perform the @xmath28 measurement . by `` fact '' i mean here , and throughout , a _ recorded _",
    "fact , an actual outcome of a measurement . restricting the notion of fact  in this way should not be understood , at this stage , as a metaphysical thesis about reality .",
    "it is simply the concept of fact  that is analytically related to our notion of event , in the sense that only a recordable event can potentially be the object of a gamble .",
    "later , in section 4.1 and in the last section we shall come back to this issue , when we discuss the implications of the theory to the structure of reality .      in the classical case",
    "we assume that _ for all _ @xmath28 _ _  and _ _ @xmath68 _ _  the following holds _ _ @xmath77 .",
    "this makes the lattice @xmath23 an atomic boolean algebra .",
    "more specifically @xmath78  is isomorphic to the boolean algebra of the subsets of the set of all atoms , with the the usual boolean operators , with @xmath4  the set of all atoms and @xmath3  the null set .",
    "the representation theorem for quantum systems is more complicated , in this case  @xmath79  is isomorphic to the lattice of subspaces of a vector space with a scalar product , more specifically :    \\1 .",
    "there is a division ring @xmath0  ( field whose product is not necessarily commutative ) , with involutional automorphism @xmath80 ,  that is , for all @xmath81  @xmath82 , @xmath83  , @xmath84    \\2 .",
    "there s a ( left ) vector space @xmath85  over @xmath0 .",
    ". there s a hermitian form @xmath86  satisfying for all @xmath87 , and @xmath81    @xmath88 ,    @xmath89 ,    @xmath90 ,    @xmath91  if and only if @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93  be a subspace , let @xmath94  then @xmath95  is also a subspace .",
    "if @xmath96  we shall say that @xmath97  is _ closed _ , then we have @xmath98 .",
    "the representation theorem asserts that @xmath23  is isomorphic to the lattice of closed subspaces of @xmath85 , in other words @xmath99 .",
    "the operation @xmath24  is just subspace intersection , and @xmath100 .",
    "the proof of this representation theorem has essentially two parts .",
    "the first is the classical representation theorem for projective geometries which goes back to the middle of the 19th century .",
    "an irreducible , atomic , complete , lattice with a complementation @xmath101 that satisfies * o2 * , and which is modular ( * o4 * * ) is a projective geometry .",
    "the traditional result on the coordinatization of projective geometries yields the field @xmath0 and the vector space @xmath85 over it .",
    "adding the stronger conditions on @xmath101 , in particular * o4 * , enabled birkhoff and von neumann to derive the inner product structure on @xmath85 .",
    "note that so far we have not introduced any explicit physical assumption , or even a probabilistic assumption , save perhaps the indeterminacy implicit in * h4*. nevertheless , we see that the principle of superposition ( that is , the fact that @xmath85 is a linear space ) already presents itself .    in both the classical and the quantum cases some additional assumptions are needed to obtain the actual models . in the quantum case the construction will be completed if we are able to infer that @xmath102  ( the field of complex numbers ) on the basis of a probabilistic or a physically intuitive axiom .",
    "at least we would like to force @xmath0 to be either the field of real numbers , or the complex numbers , or the quaternions . in these cases the inner product of a non - zero vector by itself @xmath103 is a positive real number , and gleason s theorem describes the probabilistic structure .",
    "this is a gap in the argument which has been closed to a certain extent ( in the case of infinite dimensional hilbert spaces ) by the work of solr @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that a reasonable more straightforward probabilistic or information theoretic axiom ( such as a constraint on tensor - like products ) will close the gap even more tightly .",
    "the best result known in this direction involves a geometric axiom .",
    "it is the celebrated theorem of maria pia solr which applies in case the lattice is infinite dimensional .",
    "the extra axiom connects a projective geometric concept ( harmonic conjugation ) to the orthogonality structure .",
    "recall that a projective geometry is associated with the lattice in the following way : every atom is a _ point _ every pair of atoms generates _ a projective line _ and every triple of atoms which are not colinear determine a _ projective plane_. let @xmath28  and @xmath104 be two atoms then the line through them is @xmath105 .",
    "suppose that @xmath68 is another atom on this line , @xmath106 , then we construct a fourth point @xmath107 on the line which is called the harmonic conjugate of @xmath68 relative to @xmath28 and @xmath104 -denoted by @xmath108- as follows ( fig [ 1 ] ) : let @xmath109 be arbitrary and let @xmath110 , @xmath111 . denote by @xmath112 and @xmath113 then @xmath114 .",
    "the harmonic conjugate is unique ( that is , independent of the choice of @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) .",
    "it is a basic construction in projective geometry , closely related to the definitions of the algebraic operations in the field @xmath0 ( realized as the projective line ) .",

    "another way to see this point is to think about the classical propositional calculus .",
    "the lindenbaum - tarski algebra on countably many generators gives us all the expressive power we need as far as the propositional connectives are concerned .",

    "the axiomatic systems of bayesian probability theory typically include axioms which imply interpolation of probability values .",
    "the most famous ( or infamous ) one is ramsey s axiom on the existence of an `` ethically neutral '' proposition whose probability is one half ( axiom 1 in ramsey s system @xcite ) .",
    "the axiom allows ramsey to construct his theory of utilities ( or `` values '' , in his terminology ) .",

    "i propose to read solr s axiom as a probability interpolation axiom ; or at any rate to reformulate or replace it by a direct axiom about probabilities .",
    "this , however , can not be straightforward .",
    "we are not even guaranteed that a globally defined state exists on @xmath23 in the first place .",

    "finite _ orthogonality graphs such as @xmath178 of theorem 3 force any state defined on them to interpolate probability values between zero and one .",
    "this is our _ logical indeterminacy principle _ which expresses probabilistically the basic principle that differentiates the quantum event structure from the classical one .",
    "now , we can turn the tables and assert axiomatically that orthogonality relations like those in @xmath178 are realizable in @xmath23 .",
    "this assertion indirectly expresses the indeterminacy relations in their probabilistic sense . here , for example ,",
    "is how this can be done :    consider @xmath228 and the rays @xmath28 , @xmath68 through the vectors:@xmath261 , and @xmath262 respectively .",
    "let @xmath263 be the finite subset of rays guaranteed in theorem 3 ( and explicitly constructed in @xcite ) .",
    "this means that if @xmath145 is a state on @xmath178 with @xmath256 then @xmath264 .",
    "now , consider the rays in @xmath178 and their orthogonality relations _ abstractly _ , that is , as a graph , which we shall also denote @xmath178 . a candidate to replace solr s axiom",
    "can then be formulated as :    * so * * let @xmath28 , @xmath104 , @xmath265 be three orthogonal atoms then there is @xmath106 , such that the graph @xmath266 is realizable in @xmath267 .",
    "there is a way to construct the graph @xmath178 which will make * so * * obviously stronger than the original * so*. to do this simply add to @xmath178 the rays ( and orthogonality relations ) which force the relation @xmath268 .",

    "one has to solve    find the minimal @xmath178 that forces logical indeterminacy and that allows the proof of solr s theorem ( and even , perhaps , improves it to include finite dimensional cases ) .",
    "another possible candidate -analogous to savage s axiom on the existence of arbitrarily fine partitions- is the following :    * so * * * let @xmath277 ; then the wondergraph @xmath218 is realizable in any three dimensional subspace of @xmath23 that includes @xmath68 .",
    "the restriction of the graphs we have used to those realizable in @xmath202 is not essential .",
    "it may very well be that a more natural candidate for our @xmath178 or @xmath278 exists , e.g. , in @xmath279 .",
    "we turn now to the explanatory power of our analysis .",
    "the `` logic of partial belief '' provides straightforward probabilistic , or even combinatorial derivations of a variety of phenomena for which alternative approaches require complicated ad - hoc dynamical explanations .",
    "we shall consider two central examples : the first is the epr paradox and the violation of bell inequality , and the second is the measurement problem . in particular , we shall discuss the way macroscopic objects can be handled in this framework .",
    "the phenomenological difference between classical and quantum probability is most dramatic when quantum correlations associated with entangled states are concerned .",
    "let us recall what the classical probabilistic analysis of the situation is : a pair of objects is sent from the source , one in alice s direction , one in bob s direction .",
    "alice can perform either one of two measurements on her object ; she can decide to detect the event @xmath280 or its absence ( which means detecting the event @xmath281 ) .",
    "alternatively , she can decide to check the event @xmath282 or @xmath283 .",
    "so each of these measurements has two possible outcomes .",
    "similarly , bob can test for @xmath284 or use a different test to detect @xmath285 . assuming _ nothing _ about the physics of the situation , and just considering the outcomes we get the following possible logical combinations expressed in the truth table : @xmath286{cccccccc}% x_{1 } & x_{2 } & y_{1 } & y_{2 } & x_{1}\\cap y_{1 } & x_{1}\\cap y_{2 } & x_{2}\\cap y_{1 } & x_{2}\\cap y_{2}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\\\ ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{array}\\ ] ]    it is the truth table of four propositional variables @xmath287 and four ( out of the six ) pair conjunctions , so it has @xmath288 rows , three of them shown explicitly .",
    "each row represents a possible state of affairs regarding the possible outcomes where @xmath4 indicates that the event occurs . now",
    ", suppose that we were to bet on the outcomes .",
    "there are , of course many ways to do this , but they all have to conform with the canons of rationality .",
    "the only constraint here is that each one of the @xmath288 possibilities will be assigned a non - negative probability , and the sum of these probabilities be @xmath4 .",
    "to give this fact a geometric interpretation consider each one of the @xmath288 rows in the truth table as a vector in an @xmath289 dimensional real space , then the vector of probabilities ( writing @xmath290 for @xmath291 ) @xmath292 lies in the convex hull of these @xmath288 vectors , which is a correlation polytope in @xmath293 with the @xmath288 truth values as vertices shown schematically in fig([3 ] ) .",
    "[ ptb ]    polytope1.png    the facets of the polytope , are given by linear inequalities in the probabilities , in this case the non - trivial inequalities have the form @xmath294 they are called clauser - horne inequalities , they are among what is generally known as bell inequalities .",
    "remarkably , in the mid 19-century george boole considered the most general form of the constraints on the values of probabilities of events that can be derived from the logical relations among them .",
    "he proved that these constraints have the form of linear inequalities in the probabilities . paraphrasing kant he called such constraints _ _ conditions of possible experience__.",
    "so far we have been concentrating on the classical picture .",
    "what is the quantum mechanical analysis ?",
    "again , we shall make no physical assumptions beyond those which are given by the axioms of the event structure .",
    "with the two particles we associate a hilbert space of the form @xmath295 , where in case the objects are spin-@xmath296 particles , @xmath297 .",
    "the relevant lattice is thus @xmath298 .",
    "the element of @xmath23 corresponding to the event @xmath280 is a two dimensional subspace of the form @xmath299 where @xmath300 and @xmath4 is the unit in @xmath301 .",
    "similarly , the event corresponding to the outcome @xmath284 on bob s side is @xmath302 , and likewise for the other cases .",
    "the event corresponding to the measurement of @xmath280 on alice s side and @xmath284 on bob s side is just the intersection : @xmath303 note also that @xmath304 , and @xmath305 are compatible .",

    "when we vary @xmath145 and the subspaces @xmath11 , @xmath308 , we see that the quantum range is larger than the classical one , and some points lie outside the classical polytope ( fig [ 3 ] ) , that is , they violate one of the facet inequalities of clauser and horne .    from the point of view developed so far this consequence is natural and follows from the event structure of quantum mechanics via gleason s theorem .",
    "we also know from corollary 10 that a violation of a clauser - horne inequality can already be depicted in a finite gamble ( an explicit construction can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "altogether , in our approach there is no problem with locality and the analysis remains intact no matter what the kinematic or the dynamic situation is ; the violation of the inequality is a purely probabilistic effect .",
    "notice that we are just using the quantum event space notion of intersection between ( compatible ) outcomes : @xmath309 , as we have used the intersection in the classical event space .",
    "the derivation of clauser - horne inequalities , indeed of many of boole s conditions , is blocked since it is based on the boolean view of probabilities as weighted averages of truth values .",
    "this , in turn , involves the metaphysical assumption that there is , simultaneously , a matter of fact concerning the truth values of incompatible propositions such as @xmath310 and @xmath311 .    recall that in section 2.2 we restricted `` matters of fact '' to include only observable records .",
    "our notion of fact  is analytically related to that of event  in the sense that a bet can be placed on @xmath280 only if its occurrence , or failure to occur , can be unambiguously recorded . however , this leaves open a metaphysical question : given that @xmath280 occurred , what is the status of @xmath282 for which no observable record can exist ?",
    "our axioms are not designed to rule out the possibility that @xmath282 _ has _ a truth value which we do not know .",
    "initially our approach was agnostic with respect to facts which leave no trace .",
    "however , as the above analysis shows , assigning truth values to @xmath282 and @xmath280 simultaneously is untenable .",
    "in other words , it is prohibited by the axioms _ a posteriori_. i believe that bohr deserves the credit for this insight , although his arguments fall short of establishing it .",
    "we should also recall that there are alternatives to quantum mechanics in which the violations of the clauser - horne inequalities have non - local dynamical origins .",
    "however , from our perspective the commotion about locality can only come from one who sincerely believes that boole s conditions are really conditions of possible experience .",
    "since these conditions are just properties of the classical intersection of events , their violation must indicate that something is not kosher with the _ measurements _ , that is , the choice of a measurement on one side may be correlated with the outcome on the other .",
    "but if one accepts that one is simply dealing with a different notion of probability , then all space - time considerations become irrelevant",
    ".      there are two measurement problems  the big problem , which is illusory , and the small problem which is real and concerns the quantum mechanics of macroscopic systems .",
    "the big problem concerns those who believe that the quantum state is a real physical state which obeys schrdinger s equation in all circumstances . in this picture a physical state",
    "in which my desk is in a superposition of being in chicago and in jerusalem is a real possibility ; and similarly a superposed alive - dead cat .",
    "in fact the linearity of schrdinger s equation implies that ( decoherence notwithstanding ) it is easy to produce states of macroscopic objects in superposition- which seems to contradict our experience , and sometimes , as in the cat case , does not even make much sense",
    ".    in our scheme quantum states are just assignments of probabilities to possible events , that is , possible measurement outcomes .",
    "this means that the updating of the probabilities during a measurement follows the von neumann - lders projection postulate and not schrdinger s dynamics .",
    "indeed , the projection postulate is just the formula for conditional probability that follows from gleason s theorem .",
    "so the big measurement problem does not arise .",
    "in particular , the cat in the schrdinger thought experiment is not superposed , but is rather cast in the unlikely role of a particle spin detector .",
    "schrdinger s equation governs the dynamics between measurements ; it dictates the way probability assignments should change over time in the absence of a measurement .",
    "the general shape of the schrdinger s equation is not a mystery either ; the unitarity of the dynamics follows from the structure of @xmath204 via a theorem of wigner @xcite , in its lattice theoretic form @xcite .",
    "however , these remarks do not completely eliminate the measurement problem because in our scheme quantum mechanics is also applicable to macroscopic objects .",
    "so suppose that @xmath28 is one of the rays in the cat s hilbert space corresponding to a living cat .",
    "let @xmath104 be one of the atoms corresponding to a dead cat so that @xmath258 . by solr",
    "s axiom there is an atom @xmath117 which bisects the angle between @xmath28 and @xmath104 .",
    "does this mean that we are back with the big measurement problem ?",
    "the answer is ` no ' ; remember that @xmath68 is not a state of the system , it is a possible measurement outcome .",
    "it is a mistake to think that by merely following schrdinger s experiment we are `` observing '' the event @xmath68 , or something like it .",
    "obviously we are not , we either see an @xmath28-like event , a live cat , or a @xmath104-like dead cat event . in order to `` see ''",
    "@xmath68 we have to devise and perform a measurement such that @xmath68 is one of its eigenspaces . for reasons that will be explained below , with all probability",
    "this is impossible .",
    "but even agreeing that _ performing _ such a measurement is impossible , we can surely think about operators for which @xmath68 is an eigenspace , say the projection on @xmath68 .",
    "so let us imagine what one will see when one performs this measurement ; what does the event @xmath68 look like ? presumably , the imagined measuring device is a huge piece of very complicated equipment , because in all likelihood the measurement of the projection on @xmath68 involves manipulating individual cat particles . in the end",
    ", however , there is a dial with two possible readings @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and @xmath68 is just the event that the dial reads @xmath4 . by lders rule the state of the cat after the measurement -assuming that @xmath68 was",
    "the outcome- is the projection on @xmath68 .",
    "the quantum state is not a physical object , it is a representation of our state of knowledge , or belief .",
    "the projection on @xmath68 represents an extremely complex assignment of probabilities to all possible events in a hilbert space of @xmath312 particles , an intractable business .",
    "one thing is clear , though , there is complete uncertainty about the cat being dead or alive @xmath313 , and of course @xmath314 .",
    "ignorance aside , is it not the case that now , after the measurement , there is a matter of fact about the cat being dead or alive ?",
    "well , no ! as in all such circumstances",
    "we can not say that there is a fact regarding this matter .",
    "it is impossible in principle to obtain a record concerning the cat being alive or dead simultaneously with the @xmath68-measurement .",
    "there is no fundamental difference between the present case and epr , meaning that we can not consistently maintain that the proposition the cat is alive  has a truth value .",
    "but the devil is in the details ; there is no way to tell from our completely schematic description what is going on in the laboratory .",
    "consequently , there is no way to tell what is the biological state of the cat .",
    "it is only after we have mastered the details of the measuring process that we can understand the exact sense in which no record of @xmath28 or of @xmath104 is obtainable .",
    "the small measurement problem is the question why we do not routinely observe events like @xmath68 for macroscopic objects .",
    "more precisely why is it hard to observe macroscopic entanglement , and what are the conditions in which it might be possible ?",
    "one answer which is certainly valid is decoherence- meaning that it is extremely hard to isolate large pieces of matter and equipment from environmental noise .",
    "decoherence is a dynamical process and its exact character depends on the physics of the situation .",
    "i would like to point a possible more fundamental , purely combinatorial reason which is an outcome of the probabilistic structure : _ the entanglement of an average ray in a multiparticle hilbert space is very weak_. to make this intuition precise we have to quantify entanglement , and define what we mean by average ray .    to make the discussion simpler",
    "we shall concentrate on qbits .",
    "so our hilbert space is composed of @xmath129 copies of the two dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath315 , and @xmath316 .",
    "an atom @xmath317 is called _ separable _ if it has the form @xmath318 with @xmath319 , otherwise an atom is called _",
    "entangled_. also , we shall call the projections on separable ( entangled ) rays , separable ( entangled , respectively ) pure states .",
    "we keep the letter @xmath320 to designate separable atoms , and denote by @xmath321 the set of all separable atoms . as usual",
    "if @xmath322 is a ray ( atom ) , we shall denote by @xmath323 a _ unit _ vector along it .",
    "now , suppose that we want to observe an entangled atom @xmath28 .",
    "more precisely , we want to obtain a positive proof that it is indeed entangled . to do this we have to design a measurement that will distinguish the ray @xmath28 from all the separable atoms @xmath324 .",
    "a hermitian operator that does this always exists , and will be called an _ entanglement witness for _ @xmath28 , or in short , a witness .",
    "the normalization of witnesses is a matter of convention and for our purpose we shall use the following :    an hermitian operator @xmath154 on @xmath325 ( @xmath129 copies ) is called an entanglement witness if it satisfies @xmath326 while @xmath327    so a witness is an observable whose expectation on every separable state is bounded between @xmath328 and @xmath4 , while it has an eigenvalue that is larger than @xmath4 in absolute value .",
    "any one - dimensional eigenspace @xmath28 corresponding to this eigenvalue is obviously entangled .",
    "denote by @xmath329 the set of all entanglement witnesses on @xmath330 .",
    "one way to estimate _ how much _ a given @xmath331 is entangled is to calculate @xmath332 a witness @xmath154 at which the value @xmath333 obtains is the best witness for the entanglement of @xmath28 .",
    "if we allow that every measurement involves errors then the larger @xmath333 is , the more likely we are to actually observe it .",
    "the good news is that _ there are rays _",
    "_  such that _ _ @xmath335 .",
    "these correspond to the the maximally entangled states , the so - called generalized ghz states .",
    "however , it seems that such rays become more and more rare as @xmath129 increases . to formulate this intuition precisely ,",
    "let @xmath336 be the _",
    "normalized _ uniform ( lebesgue ) measure on the unit sphere of @xmath330 .",
    "then we    there is a universal constant @xmath337 such that @xmath338    a similar result has been established for a large family of witnesses that for each @xmath129 contains @xmath339 witnesses , and which include those that give the best estimation for the ghz states @xcite ; hence the conjecture .",
    "i think the conjecture , if true , concerns our ability to observe macroscopic entanglement .",
    "there are two types of macroscopic or mesoscopic rays whose entanglement might be witnessed , and the conjecture concerns the second case :    * 1*. there may be relatively rare cases in which the entanglement witness happens to be a thermodynamic observable , that is , an observable whose measurement does not require manipulation of individual particles but only the observation of some global property of the system .",
    "there are some indications that this may be the case for some spin chains and lattices @xcite .",
    "* 2*. cases of very strong entanglement , like ghz , which do require many manipulations of individual particles to be observed ; however , the value of @xmath333 is large enough to give significant results that rise above the measurement errors .",
    "if we assume that the measurement errors are independent , then the total expected error grows exponentially with the number of particles that are manipulated .",
    "so , in general , one expects that only @xmath28 s for which @xmath333 is exponential in the number of manipulated particles could yield a significant outcome .",
    "the conjecture proposes that the proportion of such @xmath28 s is low .",
    "to sum up : the answer to the question `` why do nt i see chairs in superposition '' is twofold , decoherence surely , but even if we could turn it off , there is the combinatorial possibility that `` seeing '' something like this is nearly impossible .",
    "all this , luckily , does not prevent the existence of exotic macroscopic superpositions that can be recorded .",
    "in this paper , all we have discussed is the hilbert space formalism . i have argued that it is a new kind of probability theory that is quite devoid of physical content , save perhaps the indeterminacy principle which is built into axiom * h4*. within this formal context there is no explication of what a measurement is , only the identification of `` observables '' as hermitian operators . in this respect",
    "the hilbert space formalism is really just a syntax which represents the set of all possible outcomes , of all possible measurements .",
    "it is analogous to the mathematical concept of a probability space , in which certain subsets are identified as events .",
    "however , the mathematical theory of probability itself does not tell us the nature of the connection between these formal creatures and real events in the world .    but even before a connection is made between the formal and physical sense of measurement i think there is an interesting philosophical problem here .",
    "our formalism seems to be consistent : there is a _",
    "possible _ world where measurements and their outcomes behave in the way described above .",
    "this would not have been a serious problem if the classical theory of probability were not conceived as _ a priori _ in some sense .",
    "but the theory of probability is a part of what we take as our theory of inference , hence the term ` _ _ logic _ _ of partial belief ' . as such it is also a ground for the formation of rational expectations .",
    "therefore , the fact that there is a consistent alternative poses a problem similar to the problem that non - euclidean geometry raised even before general relativity .",
    "what should we make of a world in which boole s conditions of possible experience are violated for no reason other than the structure of probabilities described here ?    what is real in the quantum world ?",
    "firstly , there are objects- particles about which the theory speaks- which are identified by a set of parameters that involve no uncertainty , and can be recorded in all circumstances and thus persist through time and context @xcite . among them",
    "are the rest mass , electric charge , baryonic number , etc .",
    "the other part of quantum reality consists of events , that is , recordings of measurements in a very broad sense of the word .",
    "now , one has to distinguish between measurements on the one hand and interactions between material objects on the other .",
    "the latter are best described in the heisenberg picture : there is a time dependent interaction hamiltonian @xmath340 which , like any other observable , defines at every moment @xmath341 a set of _ possible _ outcomes , one of the outcomes would obtain _ if _ @xmath340 were measured .",
    "if , in addition , we have formed a belief about the state of the system at time @xmath342 ( as a result of a previous measurement , say ) we automatically have a probability distribution over the set of all possible outcomes of all possible measurements at each @xmath341 .",
    "so each interaction constrains the set of possible outcomes in a certain specific way , and the question which interactions can actually be executed is an empirical question , to be tested by observing the outcomes and their distributions .",
    "measurements are _ not _ interactions in this sense ; although in the broad description of an experiment there is usually an interaction leading to the measurement .",
    "it is impossible to give a precise definition of all the physical processes that deserve the name _ measurement _ ; just as it is not possible to define the term _ event _ to which the theory of probability can be applied .",
    "even a non - contextual definition of a singular concrete measurement is hard to provide ; in this sense measurement outcomes are events `` under a description '' , as philosophers say . broadly speaking",
    ", a measurement is a process in which a material system @xmath343 , prepared in a specific way , records some aspect of another system @xmath344 , a recording that effects a permanent change in @xmath343 , or at least one that lasts long enough .",
    "the outcomes to which we have referred throughout the paper are such recordings .",
    "probably the best way to describe measurements is in informational terms .",
    "the information recorded by a measurement is _ systematic _ in the sense that a repeated conjunction of @xmath343 and @xmath344 yields the same set of results , and the frequency distribution over the set of results stabilizes in the long run . of the same importance",
    "is the information that is lost during a measurement , the outcome that we could have obtained if any other measurement @xmath345 were performed instead of @xmath343 @xcite .",
    "this description is broad enough to include the change that photons imprint on the receptors of the retina ; it also includes the change caused by a proton hitting a rock on the dark side of the moon .",
    "there is nothing specifically human about measurements , nor does @xmath343 have to be associated with a macroscopic system .",
    "what constitutes a `` measuring device '' can not be determined beyond this broad description",
    ". however , there is a structure to the set of events . not only does each and every type of measurement yield a systematic outcome ; but also the set of all possible outcomes of all measurements -including those that have been realized by an actual recording- hang together tightly in the structure of @xmath204",
    "this is the quantum mechanical structure of reality .",
