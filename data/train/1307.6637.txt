    "the bending of light is among the first experimental confirmations of the theory of general relativity . as one of the important tools in modern astronomy and cosmology , the gravitational lensing",
    "is widely used for investigating extrasolar planets , dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the light bending is also of theoretical importance , in particular for studying a null structure of a spacetime .",
    "a rigorous form of the bending angle plays an important role in understanding properly a strong gravitational field @xcite . for example , strong gravitational lensing in a schwarzschild black hole was considered by frittelli , kling and newman @xcite , by virbhadra and ellis @xcite and more comprehensively by virbhadra @xcite ; virbhadra , narasimha and chitre @xcite studied distinctive lensing features of naked singularities .",
    "virbhadra and ellis @xcite and virbhadra and keeton @xcite later described the strong gravitational lensing by naked singularities ; deandrea and alexander @xcite discussed the lensing by naked singularities to test the cosmic censorship hypothesis ; eiroa , romero and torres @xcite treated reissner - nordstrm black hole lensing ; perlick @xcite discussed the lensing by a barriola - vilenkin monopole and also that by an ellis wormhole .",
    "one of peculiar features of general relativity is that the theory admits a nontrivial topology of a spacetime , for instance a wormhole .",
    "an ellis wormhole is a particular example of the morris - thorne traversable wormhole class @xcite .",
    "furthermore , wormholes are inevitably related with violations of some energy conditions in physics @xcite .",
    "for instance , dark energy is introduced to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe by means of an additional energy - momentum component in the right - hand side of the einstein equation .",
    "furthermore , the left - hand side of the einstein equation , equivalently the einstein - hilbert action , could be modified in various ways ( nonlinear curvature terms , higher dimensions , and so on ) inspired by string theory , loop quantum gravity and so on .",
    "because of the nonlinear nature of gravity , modifications to one ( or both ) side of the einstein equation might admit spacetimes significantly different from the standard schwarzschild spacetime metric , even if the spacetime is assumed to be asymptotically flat , static and spherically symmetric .",
    "one example is an ellis wormhole ( being an example of traversable wormholes ) .",
    "many years ago , scattering problems in wormhole spacetimes were discussed ( for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the ellis wormhole has a zero mass at the spatial infinity but it causes the light deflection @xcite . moreover , the gravitational lensing by wormholes has been recently investigated as an observational probe of such an exotic spacetime @xcite .",
    "several forms of the deflection angle by the ellis wormhole have been recently derived and often used @xcite .",
    "a reason for such differences has been clarified by several authors @xcite .",
    "small changes in gravitational lensing in modified gravity theories such as @xmath4 and fourth - order gravity have been studied ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , horvath , gergely , and hobill @xcite studied lensing effects with negative convergence by so - called tidal charges in the dadhich et al .",
    "solution , where , for a brane world black hole , the tidal charge arises from tidal forces acting at the brane - bulk boundary @xcite .",
    "a point is that negative convergence in this case does not require any exotic matter .",
    "it comes from the weyl curvature in higher dimensions .    inspired by a number of works on modifications in gravitational lensing , kitamura et al .",
    "@xcite assume , in a phenomenological sense , that an asymptotically flat , static and spherically symmetric modified spacetime could depend on the inverse distance to the power of positive @xmath0 in the weak field approximation .",
    "the schwarzschild spacetime and the ellis wormhole correspond to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , so that these spacetimes can be expressed as a one - parameter family .",
    "this one - parameter model expresses a spherical mass distribution .",
    "note that birkhoff s theorem could say that cases @xmath3 might be non - vacuum , if the models were interpreted in the framework of the standard einstein equation .",
    "kitamura et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that demagnification could occur for @xmath5 including the ellis wormhole case ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "they have also shown that time - symmetric demagnification parts might appear in light curves due to gravitational microlensing effects by such exotic models , where light curves are useful in microlensing observations in our galaxy .",
    "for cosmological situations , however , the einstein ring size becomes so large and hence the typical time scale is so long that light curves can not be observable in cosmology .",
    "on the other hand , the image separation angle becomes sufficiently large , so that it can be practically measured . by using the latest result in the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search , takahashi and asada",
    "have recently set the first upper bound on the cosmic abundances of ellis wormholes and also negative - mass compact objects @xcite . in theoretical physics , negative mass is a hypothetical concept of matter whose mass is of opposite sign to the mass of normal matter .",
    "although possible negative mass ideas have been often discussed since the 19th century , there has been no evidence for them @xcite .",
    "the negative masses might attract each other to form a negative massive clump , so that such clumps could reside in cosmological voids ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "gibbons and kodama @xcite have shown that curvature - regular asymptotically flat solitons with negative mass are contained in the myers - perry family , though the soliton solutions in the odd spacetime dimensions might not express real astrophysical objects .    however , the information on the image separation angle is not sufficient for distinguishing exotic lens models . hence , izumi et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated gravitational lensing shear by an exotic lens object with negative convergence or negative mass .",
    "they have shown that images by the lens models for the gravitational pull ( like a convex lens in optics ) are tangentially elongated , whereas those by the repulsive ones ( like a concave lens ) are radially distorted .",
    "their study @xcite might concern the strong ( or weak ) lensing surveys at the extra - galactic or cosmological distance .",
    "therefore , the main purpose of the present paper is to study microlensed image centroid motions by such exotic gravitational lens models . here",
    ", we focus on the microlensing in our galaxy . studies of centroid displacements of lensed images have been often done for the schwarzschild lens @xcite .",
    "virbhadra and keeton @xcite have investigated the centroid displacement for naked singularities by using the janis - newman - winicour solution .",
    "toki et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the centroid motion by ellis wormhole .",
    "the main results of the present paper are : ( 1 ) for certain exotic lens models , the centroid shift from the source position might move on a multiply - connected curve like a _ bow tie _ for large @xmath0 cases , while it is known to move on an ellipse for @xmath1 case @xcite and to move on an oval curve for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "( 2)for concave - type repulsive lens models , the centroid displacement might move on a simply - connected curve but might be elongated vertically to the source velocity , while it is tangentially elongated for schwarzschild case .",
    "we take the units of @xmath6 throughout this paper .",
    "this section briefly summarizes the basics of the exotic lens models @xcite .",
    "following kitamura et al .",
    "@xcite , the present paper assumes that an asymptotically flat , static and spherically symmetric modified spacetime could depend on the inverse distance to the power of positive @xmath0 in the weak field approximation .",
    "we consider the light propagation through a four - dimensional spacetime , though the whole spacetime may be higher dimensional .",
    "the four - dimensional spacetime metric is expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the circumference radius and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are small book - keeping parameters in iterative calculations .",
    "the weak field approximation means @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "namely , we study a far field from the lens object as @xmath13 and @xmath14 . note that eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) is not valid in the strong field near @xmath15 ( please see @xcite for more detail ) . here",
    ", @xmath9 and @xmath10 may be either positive or negative , respectively .",
    "negative @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath1 correspond to a negative mass ( in the linearized schwarzschild metric ) .    without loss of generality , we focus on the equatorial plane @xmath16 , since the spacetime is spherically symmetric . the deflection angle of light is obtained at the linear order as @xcite @xmath17 where the integral is positive definite , @xmath18 denotes the impact parameter of the light ray , and we define @xmath19 . by absorbing the positive integral into the parameter @xmath20 , we rewrite the linear - order deflection angle simply as @xmath21 , where the sign of @xmath22 is the same as that of @xmath20",
    "this deflection angle recovers the schwarzschild ( @xmath1 ) and ellis wormhole ( @xmath2 ) cases . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the deflection angle of light is always positive , which means that the corresponding spacetime model causes the gravitational pull on light rays . for @xmath24 , on the other hand , it is inevitably negative , which implies the gravitational repulsion on light rays like a concave lens .",
    "we mention an effective mass .",
    "a simple application of the standard lens theory @xcite suggests that the deflection angle of light in the form of @xmath21 corresponds to a convergence ( scaled surface mass density ) as @xmath25 which implies an extended spherical distribution of matter ( or energy ) for @xmath3 and a singular source only for @xmath26 .    for the weak - field schwarzschild case ( @xmath26 )",
    ", it follows that the convergence vanishes . for @xmath23 and @xmath5 , the effective surface mass density of the lens object",
    "is interpreted as negative in the framework of the standard lens theory @xcite .",
    "this means that the matter ( and energy ) needs to be exotic if @xmath23 and @xmath5 .",
    "also when @xmath24 and @xmath27 , the convergence is negative and hence the matter ( and energy ) needs to be exotic .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath24 and @xmath5 , the convergence is positive everywhere except for the central singularity and hence exotic matter ( and energy ) is not required in the framework of the standard lens theory , in spite of the gravitational repulsion on light rays .",
    "attraction ( @xmath23 ) and repulsion ( @xmath24 ) in the above two - parameter models do not have a one - to - one correspondence to positive convergence @xmath28 and negative one @xmath29 .",
    "this point is summarized in table [ table-1 ] @xcite .      under the thin lens approximation , it is useful to consider the lens equation as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the angular position of the source and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the distances from the observer to the lens , from the observer to the source , and from the lens to the source , respectively . note that there is the mathematical consistency of the use of the lens equation eq .",
    "( [ lenseq ] ) , where the trigonometric functions are approximated by their leading terms .",
    "the present paper studies the leading term in the deflection angle , so that eq .",
    "( [ lenseq ] ) can be mathematically consistent . on the other hand , if one wishes to include the next ( and higher order ) for the bending angle , the third - order ( or higher - order ) terms in the expansion of the trigonometric functions have to be taken into account in the lens equation , because of the mathematical consistency @xcite .    for @xmath23 ,",
    "there is always a positive root corresponding to the einstein ring for @xmath35 .",
    "the einstein ring radius is defined as @xcite @xmath36 if @xmath24 , on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ lenseq ] ) has no positive root for @xmath37 .",
    "this is because this case describes the repulsive force . for later convenience in normalizing the lens equation",
    ", we define the ( tentative ) einstein ring radius for @xmath24 as @xmath38 though the einstein ring does not appear for this case .",
    "this radius gives a typical angular size for @xmath24 lenses .",
    "like schwarzschild lenses , there might exist a photon sphere for @xmath23 . the radius of the photon sphere for the spacetime metric by eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) might become @xmath39 see @xcite for a more thorough discussion on the photon surfaces .      following izumi et al .",
    "@xcite , let us begin with @xmath23 case .",
    "as already stated , the matter ( and energy ) needs to be exotic if @xmath40 . in the units of the einstein ring radius ,",
    "( [ lenseq ] ) is rewritten in the vectorial form as @xmath41 where we normalize @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the angular position of the image @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the corresponding vectors .",
    "there is always one image for @xmath47 , while the other image appears for @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "next , let us mention @xmath24 case @xcite . in the units of the einstein ring radius , eq .",
    "( [ lenseq ] ) is rewritten in the vectorial form as @xmath49 without loss of generality , we assume @xmath50 . then , eq . ( [ lenseqm2 ] ) has no root satisfying @xmath48 , while eq .",
    "( [ lenseqp2 ] ) has at most two positive roots .",
    "figure [ figure-1 ] shows that there are three cases of the image number .",
    "for a large impact parameter case , two images appear on the same side with respect to the lens position , while no image appears for a small impact parameter .",
    "the only one image appears only when the impact parameter takes a critical value .",
    "let us focus on the two image cases , from which the single image case can be discussed in the limit as the impact parameter approaches the particular value .",
    "let us study the microlensed image centroid motions . in any case of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",
    "the image positions are denoted by @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the corresponding amplification factors are denoted by @xmath53 and @xmath54 . without loss of generality , we take @xmath55 . in analogy with the center of the mass distribution ,",
    "the centroid position of the light distribution of a gravitationally microlensed source is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the total amplification as @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding scalar is defined as @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath60 is positive , when the centroid is located on the same side of the source with respect to the lens center .",
    "the relative displacement of the image centroid with respect to the source position is written as @xmath61 henceforth , this is referred to as the centroid shift .",
    "the corresponding scalar is defined as @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 is positive , when @xmath60 is larger than @xmath64 .    by taking account of the relation between the lens and source trajectory in the sky ,",
    "the time dependence of @xmath64 is written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the impact parameter of the source trajectory and @xmath67 is the time of closest approach . here",
    ", the source is assumed to be in uniform linear motion .",
    "we choose @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 is the einstein radius crossing time given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the transverse velocity of the lens relative to the source and observer . in the following numerical computations ,",
    "time is normalized by the einstein ring radius crossing time .",
    "in making numerical figures , we employ @xmath72 coordinates , such that the coordinate origin is chosen as the lens center , @xmath73-axis is taken along the direction of the source motion and @xmath74-axis is perpendicular to the source motion .",
    "let us begin with the @xmath23 case .",
    "see figure [ figure-2 ] for the image centroid trajectories by @xmath23 models for @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "figure [ figure-3 ] shows the image centroid shift by the @xmath23 models . for @xmath75 for instance , the maximum vertical shift of the image centroid position by the exotic lens models is @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the units of the einstein ring radius , respectively . for @xmath81 , it is nearly @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these results suggest that the astrometric lensing by the exotic models with large @xmath0 is relatively weak compared with that by the schwarzschild one ( @xmath1 ) . in the weak - field region",
    ", one can understand the suppression of the anomalous shift of the image centroid position for large @xmath0 , because the bending angle by the large @xmath0 models is proportional to the inverse impact parameter to the power of @xmath0 , whereas that by the schwarzschild lens depends on the inverse impact parameter .",
    "a distinctive feature is that in @xmath23 and @xmath86 cases bow knots might be added into the centroid shift trajectory , while the trajectory is known to be an ellipse for @xmath1 case @xcite and to be oval for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "such a multiply - connected shape of the centroid shift orbit would be an evidence of the corresponding exotic lens in astrometric observations .",
    "figure [ figure-3 ] shows the bow - tie shape might disappear when the impact parameter becomes sufficiently large , for instance @xmath87 . for @xmath23 and @xmath88",
    ", the centroid shift could be negative for the @xmath81 case .",
    "this is partly because @xmath54 becomes large compared with the @xmath1 case .    at the center of the bow tie in the centroid shift ,",
    "the image centroid position is the same as the intrinsic ( unlensed ) source position . at which time ( and the corresponding source position )",
    "does the image centroid position agree with the source position ?",
    "for schwarzschild lens , the image centroid position agrees with the source position only at @xmath89 , namely @xmath90 . in order to study this coincidence time ( and source position ) , it is convenient to use figure [ figure-4 ] for @xmath91 and @xmath92 and figure [ figure-5 ] for @xmath93 and @xmath92 . roughly speaking",
    ", the coincidence occurs at @xmath94 , namely a few times the einstein crossing time .",
    "this timescale might be used for applications to observations .",
    "next , we consider the @xmath24 case .",
    "figure [ figure-6 ] shows the image centroid motion by the @xmath24 models .",
    "note that the centroid curve does not exist for small @xmath92 because of no images .",
    "see also figure [ figure-1 ] for no image cases .",
    "such a peculiar event might be misinterpreted as an eclipse in astronomy .",
    "figure [ figure-7 ] shows the image centroid shift by the @xmath24 models . there does not appear any bow - tie shape .",
    "note that the image centroid shift is always negative , because the effective force is repulsive . for unseen lens objects ,",
    "the negative shift can be hardly distinguished from the positive one .",
    "the centroid shift trajectory for the repulsive models might be elongated vertically to the source motion direction like a prolate spheroid as shown by figure [ figure-7 ] , whereas that for convex - type attractive models such as the schwarzschild one is tangentially elongated like an oblate spheroid ( see figure [ figure-3 ] ) .",
    "figures @xmath95 and @xmath96 show that the size of the centroid shift by the repulsive models for each @xmath0 and @xmath97 is comparable to that for the corresponding @xmath23 models .      equations ( [ theta_e ] ) and ( [ theta_e2 ] ) are rewritten as @xmath98 here , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath99 are observables in astronomy , while @xmath100 and @xmath0 are not direct observables but model parameters .",
    "note that @xmath101 is comparable to the typical size of the deflection angle .    the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ observable ] ) consists of the observables and it is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "hence , eq . ( [ observable ] ) allows us to investigate @xmath102 from observations .",
    "see tables [ table-2 ] and [ table-3 ] for einstein ring size and einstein radius crossing time , respectively .",
    "near future astrometry space missions such as gaia and jasmine are expected to have angular sensitivity of a few micro arcseconds , for which the relevant parameter combination is limited as @xmath103 .",
    "roughly speaking , the mission life time is several years , for which the relevant timescale is limited as @xmath104 a few years and table [ table-3 ] thus tells the limit as @xmath105 ( for bulge ) and @xmath106 ( for lmc ) . in total , the parameter range relevant for the near future missions is @xmath107 .    before closing this section , we mention how large @xmath0 models could lead to a multiply - connected curve of the microlensed centroid shift .",
    "numerical calculations suggest that @xmath108 and @xmath23 models could produce a bow - tie shape .",
    "see also figure [ figure-8 ] for numerical computations in the vicinity of @xmath2 as @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the numerical calculations suggest that the bow tie shape could appear , if @xmath86 .",
    "numerical computations for other parameter values suggest that the maximum numbers of the loops and the knots in the the centroid curve are three and one , respectively , which are actually achieved by the @xmath88 model .",
    "we examined gravitational lens models inspired by modified gravity theories , exotic matter and energy . by using an asymptotically flat , static and spherically symmetric spacetime model of which metric depends on the inverse distance to the power of positive @xmath0",
    ", it was shown in the weak field and thin lens approximations that , for large @xmath0 cases in the convex - type models , the centroid shift from the source position might move on a multiply - connected curve like a bow tie , while it is known to move on an ellipse for @xmath1 case and to move on an oval curve for @xmath2 .",
    "this bow - tie shape by the convex - type exotic lens models is distinguishable from standard ones due to binary motions or due the microlensing by schwarzschild lens .",
    "the distinctive feature such as the bow - tie shape may be used for searching ( or constraining ) localized exotic matter or energy with astrometric observations .",
    "the parameter range relevant for the current and near - future missions such as gaia and jasmime is @xmath107 , where we assume that the accuracy in astrometry will reach a few micro arcseconds and the mission lifetime will be several years .",
    "it was shown also that the centroid shift trajectory for concave - type repulsive models might be elongated vertically to the source motion direction like a prolate spheroid , whereas that for convex - type attractive models such as the schwarzschild one is tangentially elongated like an oblate spheroid .",
    "the image centroid shift by the repulsive models is always negative , because the effective force is repulsive . for unseen lens objects ,",
    "the negative shift can be hardly distinguished from the positive one . in this sense",
