    "the study of pairing phenomena in nuclear physics has been an important topic for many years and different theoretical approaches have been developed .",
    "on one side , the seniority scheme , developed by racah and collaborators @xcite , allows for the study of pairing in the shell - model framework .",
    "modern developments of this approach led to the so - called exact pairing formalism ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . on the other side , the bardeen ",
    "schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity @xcite , originally developed for large , macroscopic systems , led bohr , mottelson and pines @xcite to point out the possible usefulness of the the bcs ideas for describing pairing phenomena in the finite nuclear systems .",
    "further work by belayev along this line showed that pairing correlations affect practically all low - energy properties of nuclei @xcite . since the early approaches",
    ", a great amount of work has been done on the effects of pairing in nuclei ( see , e. g. @xcite and references therein ) , however there are problems which deserve further attention , especially when finite - size effects become important .",
    "one of these topics , which is of current interest both in the physics of nuclei @xcite and of other mesoscopic systems @xcite , is the issue of possible collective phenomena associated with the pairing interaction .",
    "here we address this problem by using a semiclassical approximation for the equations of motion , but taking into due account the finite size of the many - body system .",
    "recently , urban and schuck @xcite have used a semiclassical approach to study the dynamics of trapped systems made of atomic fermions .",
    "these mesoscopic systems can contain a very large number of particles and can be viewed as laying between the macroscopic systems described by the bcs theory and the `` small '' nuclear systems .",
    "the semiclassical approximation of @xcite leads to simplified equations , thus allowing for the solution of problems that would become unmanageable in a fully quantum approach for a large number of constituents .",
    "the semiclassical approximation is valid for small or mesoscopic systems with a characteristic size @xmath1 , provided @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fermi momentum .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a frequency characteristic of the classical orbits and @xmath6 the fermi energy .",
    "we consider systems which , in the absence of pairing , are described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 . except for special cases , the classical orbits in the potential @xmath8 are not exactly periodic , they are rather multiply periodic ( see , for example , @xcite p.463 ) , leading to eigenfrequencies @xmath9 , which are harmonics of the fundamental frequencies @xmath10 @xcite . in nuclei , these eigenfrequencies are related to the frequencies of giant resonances .",
    "since in heavy nuclei the condition @xmath2 is well satisfied , in @xcite we have used an approach similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite to study the linear response of ( heavy ) nuclei , with the aim of developing a simplified tool for the study of pairing effects in low - energy nuclear excitations . in that paper",
    "a drastic approximation has been made : the pairing field @xmath11 has been approximated with a constant phenomenological parameter @xmath0 ( both in the statics and dynamics ) .",
    "it is well known that such an approximation violates the continuity equation and consequently introduces spurious contributions into the density strength function and its energy - weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) .",
    "this problem was solved in @xcite by means of an appropriate prescription which enforces upon the density fluctuations the constraint coming from the continuity equation , however a prescription is not very satisfactory from a theoretical point of view and here we want to improve on that approach by introducing better kinetic equations that do not need any prescription in order to satisfy the continuity equation and the ewsr .",
    "the resulting equations allow also for the study of collective effects associated with the pairing interaction .    both here and in ref .",
    "@xcite , pairing is included in semiclassical equations of motion as in ref .",
    "we focus on weak pairing where the pairing gap @xmath12 .",
    "this paper is concerned with the frequency response of nuclei and in our formalism the pairing gap is a frequency . in the limit of small @xmath13",
    "the gap may be small , while the frequency @xmath14 remains finite .",
    "mesoscopic systems with @xmath15 can also be studied with the formalism of this paper , but they are not discussed here .    while in @xcite the ( complex ) time - dependent wigner - transformed pairing field @xmath11 was approximated with a real , constant , phenomenological parameter @xmath0 , here we study the improved approximation in which , for small density fluctuations ( , , t)=_0(,)+(,,t)+^r(,t)+i^i(,t ) .",
    "thus , in the present approximation , the pairing field is allowed to oscillate and to become complex , the possible momentum dependence of the complex fluctuations is neglected though , in order to simplify the theory .",
    "the static pairing field @xmath16 is approximated with the same phenomenological constant used in @xcite , hence our approach is not fully self - consistent , however , the pairing - field fluctuations @xmath17 and @xmath18 are derived from self - consistent relations .",
    "we study the new set of equations of motion that arise in this improved approximation and determine the effects of the additional terms on the density response function of nuclei .",
    "we assume that our system is saturated both in spin and isospin space , so we do not need to introduce explicitly the spin and isospin variables and the physics can be discussed , semiclassically , in terms of the two equilibrium phase - space distributions @xmath19 , and @xmath20 which , according to ref .",

    "the nuclear mean field has been approximated with a spherical square - well potential and it has been found that the isoscalar octupole strength function shows an increase in the region of the low - energy octupole resonance , which is due to collective pairing effects .    we conclude that the semiclassical treatment of pairing introduced in @xcite and improved in the present paper , gives results in good agreement with previous quantum approaches and that the self - consistent pairing - field fluctuations considered here have two main effects :    * the fluctuations of the imaginary part are essential for restoring the particle - number symmetry which is broken by the constant-@xmath0 approximation ( this is already well known from studies of infinite systems ) ; * there is a mild collective effect in the octupole response function due to the pairing interaction and no similar effect is found in the monopole and quadrupole response function .",
    "in this appendix it is shown that only one branch of the solutions of the equations of motion ( [ coe1][coe4 ] ) approximately satisfy the supplementary condition ( [ pauli ] ) required by the pauli principle for the modes @xmath110 .",

    "it is important to note that , if we put @xmath170 in this relation , it gives ^r_(|_)=-^ev_(| _ ) , in agreement with the pauli constraint ( [ pauli ] ) .",
    "the solutions of the homogeneous system ( [ eom1][eom4 ] ) are non vanishing only at the eigenfrequencies @xmath66 and @xmath67 , but we have seen that the frequencies @xmath66 are well approximated by @xmath57 and the fact that the condition ( [ pauli ] ) is satisfied when @xmath170 , means that the branch of solutions corresponding to @xmath66 approximately satisfies the supplementary condition ( [ pauli ] ) : ^r_(_+)-^ev_(_+ ) , while the same is not true for the solutions corresponding to the frequencies @xmath67 .",
    "thus , following anderson @xcite and valatin @xcite , we can say that only the solutions corresponding to the branch @xmath171 are acceptable .",
