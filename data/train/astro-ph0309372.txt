    "star formation is the main driver of galactic evolution . despite four decades of intense observational and theoretical investigation",
    "( see e.g. elmegreen 2002 for a recent overview ) our understanding of the subject remains frustratingly poor . as a result ,",
    "important questions related e.g. to the putative threshold and to the rate of star formation in galaxies have no clear answers yet .    in",
    "most ( if not all ) studies of galaxy evolution , empirical formulae are used to describe the star formation .",
    "such formulae are based on the original suggestion by schmidt ( 1959 ) , namely that the star formation rate ( sfr ) is simply proportional to some power @xmath1 of the gas mass density @xmath2 . in the case of disk galaxies and starbursts observations ( kennicutt 1998b ) suggest that such a relation indeed holds when gas surface density @xmath3 is used instead of the mass density and when quantities are averaged over the whole optical disk ; in that case , the exponent @xmath1 is found to be close to 1.5 .",
    "however , kennicutt ( 1998b ) noted that other interpretations of the data are possible : in particular , an equally good fit to the data is obtained when it is assumed that gas turns into stars within a dynamical timescale ( taken to be the orbital timescale at the optical radius ) .",
    "such `` global '' laws may be useful for some applications ( like e.g. semi - analytical models of galaxy evolution ) but for detailed models of galactic disks `` local '' sf laws are required .",
    "several such laws have been suggested either on observational ( e.g. dopita & ryder , 1994 ) or theoretical grounds ( e.g. dynamical instabilities in spirals , ohnisi 1975 , wyse & silk 1989 ) . in a recent work ,",
    "wong & blitz ( 2002 ) find that the simple schmidt law is valid locally , with @xmath1=1.1 - 1.7 ( depending on whether extinction on the observed h@xmath0 emissivity profiles of their disks is assumed to be uniform or dependent on gas column density ) .",
    "they also find that a dynamically modified schmidt law ( i.e. by introducing the orbital timescale as kennicutt 1998b ) gives also an acceptable fit to their data .",
    "the question of a threshold in star formation in galactic disks has been observationally assessed by kennicutt ( 1989 ) , who found that star formation is strongly suppressed below @xmath45 - 10 m@xmath5 pc@xmath6 .",
    "the existence of such a threshold is indeed suggested by dynamical stability analysis of thin , gaseous , differentially rotating disks ( e.g. toomre 1964 , quirk 1972 ) . in a recent investigation ,",
    "martin and kennicutt ( 2001 ) found that the threshold gas density ( measured at the edge of the star forming disk ) varies by at least an order of magnitude among spiral galaxies , but the ratio of gas density to a critical density ( see sect . 4 for its definition ) is much more uniform .",
    "martin & kennicutt ( 2001 ) also identified the limitations of their observational strategy : uncertainties associated with non axisymmetric gas distributions and with the extrapolation of the molecular gas density profile , from the last observed point to the edge of the star forming disk .",
    "the latter issue was properly studied by wong & blitz ( 2002 ) with the help of detailed molecular profiles , but for a limited sample of spirals , particularly rich in molecular gas .",
    "their conclusion is that the gravitational stability criterion has only a limited application .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", quite a lot of work has been done to include more physics in the analysis than the simple stability criterion ( e.g. toomre 1981 , elmegreen 1987 , romeo 1992 , wang & silk 1994 etc . )",
    "the general conclusion is that the various physical factors ( stars , magnetic fields , turbulence ) affect only slightly the stability parameter , by a factor of order unity .    in a recent work schaye ( 2002 )",
    "reassesses the role of the gas velocity dispersion in the application of the simple stability criterion .",
    "he suggests that the usual assumption of a constant dispersion over the disk may not hold and he investigates the stability of thin , gaseous , self - gravitating disks imbedded in dark halos and illuminated by uv radiation .",
    "he finds that the drop in the velocity dispersion associated with the transition from a warm to a cold phase of the interstellar medium ( i.e. from @xmath710@xmath8 k to below 10@xmath9 k ) causes the disk to become gravitationally unstable .",
    "this analysis leads to prescriptions for evaluating threshold surface densities as a function of metallicity , intensity of uv radiation , and gaseous fraction .",
    "however , a major prediction of his model analysis seems to be contradicted by observations .",
    "indeed , he finds that at the phase transition there is always a sharp increase in the molecular gas fraction , whereas martin & kennicutt ( 2001 ) find that at the thresholds of their star forming disks the gas is primarily atomic ( for the low gas surface densities ) or molecular ( for the highest gas surface densities ) , i.e. no clear sign of a phase transition .    in this work ,",
    "we reassess the applicability of the toomre criterion in galactic disks and we study the local star formation law by means of a homogeneous sample containing 16 spirals , half of which belong to the virgo cluster . in sect .",
    "2 we present our data sample , which consists of profiles of stars , atomic and molecular gas , star formation rates ( from h@xmath0 emissivities ) , metallicities and rotation curves . in sect .",
    "3 we present briefly the theoretical background of the stability criterion , including a modification suggested by wang & silk ( 1994 ) .",
    "we show that it applies successfully to the case of the milky way disk ( sect .",
    "3.2 ) but it has limited success with the data of our sample . in sect .",
    "4 we test various sf laws proposed in the literature , i.e. either the simple schmidt law or modifications of it , that take into account dynamical factors .",
    "we find only small differences among them as far as the overall fit to our data is concerned ; in particular , we find that all three sf laws ( with parameters derived from the fits to our data ) match particularly well observations in the milky way disk . in all cases",
    "we find that the exponent @xmath1 of our best fit sfr has slightly higher values than in other recent works and we suggest several reasons that may cause that discrepancy .",
    "our results are summarised in sect .",
    "the galaxies of our sample were selected for a detailed study of the star formation properties in nearby spirals .",
    "our first requirement was that abundance measurements in hii regions are available so that a metallicity gradient is defined .",
    "the molecular gas profile can then be deduced from co observations with a metallicity dependent conversion factor recently determined ( see boselli et al . , 2002 and sec .",
    "2.3 below ) . for this reason",
    ", these galaxies do not form a complete sample in any sense but are the ones for which the metallicity - dependent conversion factor can be used .",
    "an accurate estimate of the radial profile of atomic gas and of the star formation rate ( here deduced from  emission line intensities ) is also required for our purpose .",
    "some of the proposed instability criteria in galactic disks involve the rotation frequency ( requiring knowledge of the rotation curve ) , the stellar surface density profile ( obtained from the h and k band profiles ) , and also the velocity dispersion of the stellar component ( derived in sec .",
    "the final list of galaxies , only selected to have abundance gradients published and the other data needed for our analysis , includes 16 galaxies , 7 of them `` isolated '' and 9 belonging to the virgo cluster ( most of the data concerning the virgo galaxies are available via the goldmine database , gavazzi et .",
    "al , 2003 ) .",
    "note that some of the `` isolated '' galaxies are in fact part of small groups ( ngc2403 , 3031 , 4258 , 5194 ) .    in order to estimate the degree of perturbation induced by the interaction of a galaxy with its environment , we use the _ hi deficiency parameter _",
    ", defined as hi def .",
    "= log(@xmath10hi@xmath11/hi ) , the ratio of the average hi mass in isolated objects of similar morphological type and linear size to the hi amount of an individual galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sample includes both gas deficient ( hi def .",
    "@xmath110.3 ) and gas rich galaxies to study whether their sfr profiles are affected by the amount of available gas .",
    "it has been selected to span the largest possible range in gas column density within late - type galaxies of similar type .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     the differences are relatively modest , contrary to what occurred for the threshold , since the fits are essentially determined by the data concerning the main body of the molecular disk .    adopting a flat rotation curve instead of the analytical rotation curve of equ .",
    "[ pseudorota ] leads also to small differences : we obtain a slightly lower slope ( 1.28 in the case of no h@xmath12 extrapolation and 1.32 in the case of h@xmath12 extrapolation ) for a flat rotation curve than with the analytical rotation curve ( respectively 1.38 and 1.48 ) .",
    "in conclusion , the sf laws that we obtained depend only weakly on assumptions concerning the rotation curve and the molecular gas profile in the outer disk .      in the previous section",
    ", we determined the parameters of three widely used star formation laws ( equations [ eqsfr1 ] , [ eqsfr2],[eqsfr3 ] ) by means of our galaxy sample .",
    "as in the case of the sf threshold ( see sec .",
    "3.2 ) , it is interesting to see how the resulting sf laws match the star formation data of the milky way disk .    using the well known gaseous and stellar radial profiles of the milky way and a flat rotation curve ( v(r)=220 km s@xmath13 ) , we calculated the corresponding sf profiles ; the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ profilmw ] , respectively for the simple schmidt law ( _ dotted curve _ ) , the schmidt law modified by the dynamical factor v / r ( _ short - dashed curve _ ) and the schmidt law modified by the stellar density ( _ long - dashed curve _ ) .",
    "we compare the results to the sf radial profile of the galaxy , as estimated through various tracers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "note that the observations were scaled to the value of the sfr in the solar neighborhood which has its own uncertainty ; the box in the center of the figure indicates the range of its possible values @xcite .",
    "the three sf laws produce quite similar results in the range 4 - 18 kpc , i.e. in the whole radial extent of the disk .",
    "the pure schmidt law fails considerably in the inner disk ( inside 3 kpc ) , since the low amounts of gas there do not allow it to reproduce the relatively high values of observed sfr .",
    "all three laws give satisfactory results in the 4 - 15 kpc range , while the modified schmidt laws fit the observations also in the inner disk ; however , due to several complications that might arise in that region ( i.e. role of the bar in the star formation ) the `` success '' of the modified schmidt laws in that region should not be considered as a `` proof '' a their validity .    in summary ,",
    "data for the milky way disk are compatible with all three sf laws that we empirically determined in the previous section .",
    "only a consistent application of those sf laws in a chemical evolution model of the milky way could ( perhaps ) favour one of these sf laws over the others , by comparison to as many observed radial profiles as possible ( e. g. chemical and photometric profiles , as in the work of boissier & prantzos 1999 for the gaseous , chemical and photometric profiles of the mw disk ) .",
    "we note , however , that in practice , even this test may not be conclusive , because of the poorly known radial and temporal dependence of the gas infall rate on the disk .",
    "gaseous infall is indeed required , at least in the solar neighborhood to account for the so - called `` g - dwarf problem '' ( e.g pagel 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed study of the properties of star formation in disk galaxies .",
    "we use an extended data set , consisting of ( azimuthally averaged ) radial profiles of stellar and gaseous ( atomic and molecular ) surface densities , of star formation rates and rotation curves .",
    "the molecular gas is derived from co with a metallicity dependent conversion factor for the first time in this kind of study .",
    "these data allow questions related to the star formation rate and to the existence of a star formation threshold in galactic disks to be studied .",
    "our sample comprises 16 disk galaxies , about half of which belong to the virgo cluster .",
    "the existence of star formation threshold in our disks was studied by using the toomre ( 1964 ) instability criterion and using either the gaseous component alone or both the gaseous and stellar components in the definition of the instability parameter q. in the latter case , the profile of stellar velocity dispersion is also required and we calculated it for our disks based on the observations of bottema ( 1993 ) .",
    "we also used both analytical and observed rotation curves for the evaluation of q.    we find that only half of our sample galaxies are overcritical ( i.e. locally unstable and prone to form stars ) when the gaseous component alone is taken into account , even in disk regions where observations indicate that vigorous star formation is taking place . including the stellar component improves substantially the situation , since only two disks remain sub - critical then ( and only marginally so ) .",
    "these results refer to an average value of the instability parameter q=0.70@xmath140.20",
    "( i.e. slightly lower than unity ) , as observationally determined by martin & kennicutt ( 2001 ) with a larger disk sample ( 32 galaxies ) .",
    "our own q value , determined at the termination of the sf profile , is similar to the above value when the stellar component is included and slightly lower when it is ignored ( 0.71 and 0.5 , respectively ) .",
    "however , in both cases , corresponding uncertainties are larger than found by martin & kennicutt ( 0.38 and 0.33 , respectively , compared to 0.20 in their case ) .",
    "we find that the instability criteria apply fairly well to the milky way disk , where q values are systematically @xmath70.7 when the gaseous component alone is used and @xmath70.9 - 1 when the stellar component is also included .",
    "we find it encouraging that the galaxy with the best defined profiles shows such an exemplary behaviour .",
    "we think that the large dispersion in the q values found in our sample result ( at least partly ) from systematic uncertainties in the various profiles entering the evaluation of q. among them , of crucial importance are : i ) the conversion factor of co emission to h@xmath12 gas amount ( we use a metallicity dependent conversion factor , unlike previous studies ) and , even more so ii ) the extrapolation of the h@xmath12 profile beyond the last observed point .",
    "these factors explain to a large part the quantitative differences between our results and those of martin & kennicutt ( 2001 ) and wong & blitz ( 2002 ) .",
    "in particular , our findings do not support the claim of wong & blitz ( 2002 ) that q is actually a measure of the gas fraction in the disks .",
    "in agreement with wong & blitz ( 2002 ) we find that the observed local ( i.e. at a given radius ) sf rate density correlates better with the total gas density or with the molecular gas density than with the neutral gas density .",
    "we analysed three local sf laws with our data : a pure schmidt law sfr@xmath15 , a schmidt law modified by the disk rotational frequency sfr@xmath16 , and a schmidt law modified by the local surface density @xmath17 : sfr@xmath18 ( according to a suggestion by dopita & ryder 1994 ) .",
    "we find that the modified schmidt laws do slightly better than the pure schmidt law , as expected in view of their supplementary degrees of freedom .",
    "we also find a larger index @xmath1 for the gaseous component than kennicutt ( 1998 ) , both for the pure schmidt law and for the one modified by rotation ( 2 and 1.5 , compared to 1.4 and 1 , respectively ) .",
    "we note that kennicutt s analysis included starburts , so that his gas surface densities covered five decades in magnitude , instead of @xmath71.5 decade in our case ; by limiting his analysis to the low surface density normal spirals , kennicutt ( 1998 ) also found larger values of @xmath1 , close to ours .",
    "besides , his analysis concerned only averaged quantities over the galactic disks , whereas ours concerns azimuthally averaged quantities , a fact which certainly explains the largest dispersion and the poorest fits that we obtain . on the other hand , wong & blitz ( 2002 ) used only azimuthally averaged quantities in their study and found values of @xmath1=1.1 for a uniform extinction model and 1.7 for an extinction dependent on the column density in the case of the pure schmidt law ; the latter case corresponds more to our own results .",
    "again , we find that the three derived sf laws apply fairly well to the data of the milky way disk , although the pure schmidt law fails in the inner galaxy ( where the situation is uncertain anyway , due to the poorly known role of the galactic bar ) .",
    "the exemplary behaviour of the milky way disk makes us think that ( either it is exceptional or ) a much more systematic work than this one could allow to determine much better the local properties of star formation in disks .",
    "such a work should involve : a much larger number of ( unperturbed ) disks than used here ; much more extended and detailed radial profiles , especially in the case of molecular gas ( for instance the results of the recent bima survey , regan et al .",
    "2001 ) ; and , above all , a much better understanding of the various systematic uncertainties of the problem , for instance concerning the absolute local values of the star formation rate and the role of non axisymmetric profiles .",
