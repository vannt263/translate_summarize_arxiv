    "inelastic hard spheres ( ihs ) provide a useful theoretical , computational , and experimental framework for studying granular gases @xcite . in the simplest version , the spheres are assumed to be smooth ( i.e. frictionless ) and the inelasticity in collisions is specified in terms of a constant coefficient of normal restitution @xmath4 @xcite . at a kinetic theory level , the essential information about the dynamical properties of the fluid is embedded in the one - particle velocity distribution function . for sufficiently low - densities ,",
    "the conventional boltzmann equation can be extended to ihs by changing the collision rules to account for the inelastic character of the interactions @xcite .",
    "however , the complex mathematical structure of the boltzmann collision operator prevents one from obtaining exact results , so that most of the analytical progress for ihs has been achieved by using approximated methods and/or simple kinetic models @xcite .",
    "for instance , the explicit forms of the navier - stokes transport coefficients have been approximately determined by considering the leading terms in a sonine polynomial expansion @xcite .",
    "needless to say , the difficulties of solving the boltzmann equation increase considerably when one considers far from equilibrium situations , such as shear flow problems .",
    "although good estimates for _ nonlinear _ transport properties of ihs have been obtained @xcite , the search of _ exact _ results has stimulated the use of model interactions simpler than hard spheres .",
    "one possibility is to consider a mean field version of the hard sphere system , where randomly chosen pairs of particles inelastically interact with a random impact direction .",
    "this assumption yields a boltzmann equation where the collision rate is _ independent _ of the relative velocity of the two colliding particles @xcite .",
    "this interaction model is usually referred to as the inelastic maxwell model ( imm ) .",
    "it must be noted that in the conventional case of ordinary gases colliding elastically , maxwell models correspond in three dimensions to particles interacting via a repulsive potential proportional to the inverse fourth power of distance @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the framework of the boltzmann equation , one can introduce maxwell models at the level of the cross section , without any reference to a specific interaction potential @xcite .",
    "thanks to the simplifications introduced by imm in the kernel of the boltzmann collision operator , it is possible in some particular situations to find non - trivial exact solutions to the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "apart from their academic interest , it has also been shown in some cases that the results derived from imm @xcite agree well with those obtained analytically for ihs from grad s method @xcite and by means of monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "we will substantiate this point in the concluding section .",
    "in addition , even recent experiments @xcite for magnetic grains with dipolar interactions are qualitatively well described by imm .",
    "all of these results clearly show the utility of imm as a toy model to unveil in a clean way the influence of the inelasticity of collisions in granular flows , especially in far from equilibrium situations where simple intuition is not enough .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the dynamics of an intruder or impurity immersed in an inelastic maxwell gas subject to the simple or uniform shear flow ( usf ) .",
    "this state is perhaps one of the most widely studied states in granular gases @xcite . from a macroscopic point of view",
    ", the usf is characterized by constant partial densities @xmath5 , a uniform granular temperature @xmath6 , and a linear velocity field @xmath7 , @xmath0 being the constant shear rate . because the only hydrodynamic gradient is that of flow velocity",
    ", the mass and heat fluxes vanish by symmetry and the pressure or stress tensor @xmath8 is the only relevant flux in the problem .",
    "the knowledge of the elements of @xmath8 gives access to the rheological properties of the mixture . in the context of imm ,",
    "the above transport properties have been recently obtained @xcite in terms of the shear rate and the parameters of the mixture .",
    "our goal now is to consider the tracer limit .",
    "since this case corresponds to a situation in which the mole fraction @xmath9 of the tracer species is negligible , one expects that the properties of the excess species ( granular gas ) are not affected by the presence of the impurity particle . in particular , the relative contribution of the impurity to the total energy of the system , @xmath10 ,",
    "is expected to be proportional to @xmath11 when @xmath12 ( here , @xmath13 denotes the total kinetic energy of the system and @xmath14 is the kinetic energy of the impurity ) .",
    "consequently , the contribution of the impurity to the total energy is likely to be negligible .",
    "however , as in the elastic case @xcite , we present in this paper a violation of the above expectation , that is ascribable to a non - equilibrium phase transition . specifically , we found that the impurity particle has a _",
    "finite _ contribution to the total energy of the system ( impurity plus granular gas ) either for light impurities under conditions that depend critically on the asymmetry of collisional dissipation ( impurity - gas against gas - gas collisions ) , or conversely , for heavy impurities provided the shear rates are not too large .",
    "this phenomenon is akin to a phase transition , where the order parameter is given by the ratio of the impurity kinetic energy over the total kinetic energy of the system .",
    "we borrow here the terminology of equilibrium phase transitions ; it should nevertheless be stressed that the kind of ordering under discussion is not spatial , but refers to a specific , kinetic , order parameter ( @xmath10 ) ; as such , the `` ordering '' scenario specifically belongs in non - equilibrium .",
    "moreover , we found that ordering always sets in at large enough shear rates ( i.e. , for shear rates larger than a certain critical value ) , provided the impurity is sufficiently light compared to the grains of the host gas . while this feature is common to elastic @xcite and inelastic systems , the possibility of what we refer below as heavy tracer ordering , is specific to inelastic gases .",

    "( `` improved maxwell model '' ) , the collision rates @xmath22 are functions of the temperature ratio @xmath35 , that is itself a function of the ( reduced ) shear rate in the usf problem .",
    "a consequence of this choice is that one has to _ numerically _ solve a set of nonlinear equations in order to get the shear rate dependence of the temperature ratio @xcite . since we wish to obtain in this paper analytical results for arbitrary spatial dimensions in a quite complex problem that involves a delicate tracer limit , we will consider here a simple version of imm where @xmath22 is independent of the partial temperatures of each species ( `` plain vanilla maxwell model '' ) .",
    "thus , one defines @xmath22 as @xmath36 where the value of the constant @xmath37 is irrelevant for our purposes . here , @xmath38 is the total number density of the mixture .",

    "the key advantage of inelastic maxwell models , in comparison with the more realistic inelastic hard sphere model , is that the collisional moments of the boltzmann collision operators @xmath287 $ ] can be exactly evaluated in terms of the velocity moments of @xmath40 and @xmath53 , without the explicit knowledge of these velocity distribution functions . here , we have explicitly determined the collisional moments associated with the second - degree velocity moments to get the pressure tensor of the mixture .",

    "<S> the boltzmann equation for inelastic maxwell models is considered in order to investigate the dynamics of an impurity ( or intruder ) immersed in a granular gas driven by a uniform shear flow . </S>",

    "<S> where the mole fraction of the intruder species vanishes , a non equilibrium phase transition takes place . </S>",
