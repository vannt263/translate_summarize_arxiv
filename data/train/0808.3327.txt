    "in order to improve the extragalactic distance scale using stellar standard candles observable in nearby galaxies , the araucaria projectbresolin / araucaria / index.html ] ( gieren et al .",
    "2001 ) has been investigating the most promising stellar distance indicators : cepheid variables , rr lyr stars , red clump stars , blue supergiants and the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) .",
    "the main goal of our project is to obtain an accurate calibration , better than 5% , of these primary distance indicators as a function of the environmental properties of the host galaxy : metallicity , age and star formation history . to achieve this goal , the araucaria project studies galaxies of different morphological types , ages and metallicities in the local group , and in the more distant sculptor group which contains a number of spiral galaxies easily accesible from the southern hemisphere .",
    "one of the araucaria target galaxies is the spiral galaxy ngc 247 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , member of the sculptor group ( jerjen et al . 1998 ; karachentsev 2005 ) .",

    "we give a brief overview about previous studies of ngc 247 which have measured the most important properties of this galaxy .",
    "+ the first authors conducting a photoelectric study of bright stars in ngc 247 in the u , b , v , r and i bands were alcaino & liller ( 1984 ) who provided a fundamental reference for the subsequent photometric calibration of resolved stellar populations of this galaxy .",
    "+ > from schmidt plates , carignan ( 1985 ) studied the surface brightness of ngc 247 and computed a distance modulus of 27.01 mag for the galaxy .",
    "it was also possible to establish that ngc 247 has an inclination of 75.4 @xmath3 , indicating the difficulty involved in the study of its stellar populations due to the problems of crowding and blending accentuated by this high inclination .    through a study of the properties of the neutral hydrogen and",
    "the mass distribution using vla data , carignan & puche ( 1990 ) established that the hi disk of ngc 247 is relatively limited in extension .",
    "based on their distance of 2.52 mpc ( carignan 1985 ) , these authors determined the total mass in hi as ( 8.0@xmath4 0.3 ) @xmath5 , which corresponds to a mass - luminosity ratio of @xmath60.34 .",
    "strssle et al .",
    "( 1999 ) made a study in the x - ray energy range between 0.25 and 2 kev using rosat data .",
    "they found that the mass of the hot gas of ngc 247 , which emits mainly in the band of 0.25 kev , is 0.7 @xmath7 .",
    "taking the model for dwarf galaxies of burlak ( 1996 ) , which integrates three components of the galaxy : stellar disk , gaseous disk and dark halo , these authors found that the total mass of ngc 247 is 7.5 @xmath8 , a value consistent with their measurements of the rotation curve for this galaxy .",
    "based on these data , strssle et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found a mass - luminosity ratio of @xmath9=28.4 , which is in agreement with determinations of the same ratio for other sculptor galaxies .    using the mosaic ii camera at the 4.0 m blanco telescope at cerro tololo , olsen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) conducted a modern study of globular clusters in the sculptor galaxies .",
    "these authors were able to detect a very small population of three globular clusters in ngc 247 .",
    "karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2006 ) were the first to measure the distance to ngc 247 from the tully - fisher method and obtained a value of 27.87 @xmath0 0.21 mag , in significant disagreement with the earlier , shorter distance value obtained by carignan . in their infrared study of the central regions of nearby galaxies , davidge & courteau ( 2002 ) had adopted a distance modulus of 27.3 mag for ngc 247 .",
    "the most recent study reporting a measurement of the distance of ngc 247 from a stellar population was performed by davidge ( 2006 ) .",
    "based on the i - band magnitude of the trgb , he obtained a distance modulus of 27.9 @xmath0 0.1 mag , which implies a distance of 3.80 @xmath0 0.18 mpc , making this galaxy one of the most distant targets of the araucaria project . taking into account the inclination of the ngc 247 disk",
    ", davidge stressed that variable internal extinction is expected , since the galaxy inclination favors the possibility that the line of sight passes through dust clouds more than once .",
    "freedman et al . ( 1988 ) , and catanzarite et al . (",
    "1994 ) were the first to mention the discovery of a number of cepheid variables in ngc 247 .",
    "they reported that twelve cepheids had been found from optical surveys in b , v , r and i bands conducted at ctio and lco .",
    "unfortunately , a catalog and/or photometric data for these cepheids were never published .",
    "this paper is the first study which reports the discovery of a sizeable cepheid population in ngc 247 in a verificable catalog .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : details of the observations , data reductions , and calibrations are described in  2 .",
    "the catalog of photometric properties of the 23 cepheid variables in ngc 247 we have discovered is presented in  3 .",
    "the determination of the distance of ngc 247 from the observed period - luminosity relations in the v and i bands , and in the reddening - independent wesenheit index is the subject of  4 .",
    "we discuss our results in  5 and summarize our conclusions in  6 .",
    "ngc 247 was observed with the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at lco , the 2.2 m mpg / eso telescope at la silla observatory and the 4.0 m blanco telescope at ctio .",
    "each telescope was equipped with a mosaic 8k @xmath10 8k detector with a field of view ( fov ) and a scale factor ( sf ) as indicated in the table 1 . for more instrumental details on these cameras ,",
    "the reader is referred to the camera web sites .",
    "the observations of ngc 247 with the 1.3 m warsaw telescope were conducted in service mode . the collection of data began on 2003 august 5 , and ended on 2004 december 18 .",
    "we obtained 40 epochs in the v - band and 38 epochs in the i band . with the 2.2 m telescope at la silla , service mode observations in the v band",
    "were obtained for 19 epochs between 2003 june 23 and 2005",
    "november 6 . with the ctio 4.0 m telescope , we obtained data in the v and i bands during 9 epochs .",
    "these observations were conducted in visitor mode between 2002 october 30 and 2005 january 17 .",
    "table 2 summarizes the information about the observations for each telescope .    for all images ,",
    "the debiasing and flat - fielding reductions were done with the iraf package .",
    "then , point - spread function photometry was obtained for all stars in the same way described by pietrzyski et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "independently , data taken with the 1.3 m warsaw telescope were reduced with the ogle - iii pipeline based on the image subtraction technique ( udalski 2003 ; woniak 2000 ) .",
    "+ in order to perform an accurate calibration of our instrumental photometry obtained with the 1.3 m warsaw telescope onto the standard system , this galaxy was observed on an excellent photometric night , 2006 january 26 , in v and i bands , along with 25 landolt standard stars which were monitored at very different air masses , and covered a wide range of colors ( -0.14 @xmath11 1.43 ) . because the transformation equations for each chip can have different zero points , the standard star sample was observed on each chip individually .",
    "the transformation equations which were obtained for each chip on which the galaxy was recorded ( chips 2 and 3 ) are given in table 3 .",
    "lower case letters @xmath12 and @xmath13 refer to the aperture instrumental magnitudes , standardized to one second exposure time .",
    "capital letters refer to the magnitudes calibrated onto the standard system .",
    "the computed color coefficients are consistent with those which were derived to calibrate our earlier mosaic data from the same telescope and camera for ngc 6822 ( pietrzynski et al .",
    "2004 ) , ngc 3109 ( pietrzynski et al .",
    "2006a ) , ngc 55 ( pietrzynski et al .",
    "2006b ) and wlm ( pietrzynski et al .",
    "2007 ) , all these galaxies being targets of the araucaria project .    to correct the possible small variation of the photometric zero points in v and i over the mosaic , the maps established by pietrzyski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) were used .",
    "comparison with studies in the other araucaria papers revealed that these maps allow us to correct the zero - point variations across the mosaic field in such a way that the residuals do not exceed 0.02 - 0.03 mag .    in order to perform an external check of our photometry",
    ", we compared it to the photoelectric measurements obtained by alcaino & liller ( 1984 ) , who established a sequence of secondary standards in the field of ngc 247 . in our database four stars",
    "were found to be common to this sequence .",
    "the remaining ones were either saturated or located outside our field of view . in table 4 ,",
    "the first column gives the identification of the stars according to the alcaino & liller ( 1984 ) system .",
    "the second column is the v magnitude measured by alcaino & liller .",
    "the third column reports the v magnitude obtained in this work .",
    "the comparison of our v - band photometry for these objects with that of alcaino & liller demonstrates that the zero points of the two data sets agree within 0.02 mag .    in order to calibrate the instrumental photometry obtained with the 2.2 m and 4.0 m telescopes ,",
    "linear offsets were applied to the photometric zero points of the data since the magnitudes did not show any dependence on the color terms .",
    "we developed an internal test to estimate the zero point photometry accuracy of the final data set obtained by joining data of the three telescopes . computing the mean magnitudes of bright stars observed with each telescope , and comparing the values with those obtained by combining data of the three telescopes , we were able to establish that the accuracy of the v and i zero points of the photometry is 0.02 mag and 0.01 mag , respectively .",
    "this is borne out in the cepheid light curves obtained from the combined datasets , where in no case evidence for systematic offsets between the datasets from the different cameras is observed ( see fig .",
    "the photometric database was made with the 2.2 m and 4.0 m telescopes data .",
    "this database was constructed using the daomaster and daomatch programs ( stetson 1994 ) .",
    "a search for variable stars with periods between 0.2 and 150 days was conducted using the analysis of variance algorithm ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1989 ) and fnpeaks software ( kolaczkowski private information ) . in order to distinguish cepheids from other types of variable stars , the same criteria used by pietrzyski et al .",
    "( 2002b ) were adopted .",
    "all light curves showing the typical shape of cepheid variables were approximated by fourier series of order less than 5 and 4 for photometric time - series in the v and i bands , respectively .",
    "then we rejected all candidates whose amplitudes in the v band were smaller than 0.4 mag , which is approximately the lower limit amplitude for normal classical cepheids .",
    "for the variable stars passing our selection criteria , mean v and i magnitudes were derived by integrating their light curves which had been previously converted onto an intensity scale , and converting the results back to the magnitude scale . the quality and phase coverage of the light curves allowed us to obtain a statistical accuracy of the derived mean magnitudes in the v band as typically 0.01 mag for the brightest variables , increasing to 0.03 mag for the faintest cepheids in our sample .",
    "our cepheid catalog consists of 23 members .",
    "table 5 presents their identifications , equatorial coordinates , periods , v and i mean magnitudes , and their wesenheit index magnitudes defined as @xmath14 = i - 1.55(@xmath15 ) ( see udalski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ) .",
    "other variables in ngc 247 discovered in our search for photometric variability and not classified as cepheids will be studied in a forthcoming paper . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the v and i light curves of a typical cepheid we have discovered in ngc 247 , cep015 with a period of 41.4 days , as obtained from the combined datasets . it can be seen that the different datasets match each other very well indeed , and that the light variations of this ( and the other ) cepheid in our catalog in the v and i bands are very well determined .",
    "the relatively small number of cepheids detected from our images in ngc 247 is not surprising , given the distance to this galaxy and the fact that most of the frames were obtained on small telescopes ( there were only 9 epochs obtained on the blanco 4-m telescope ) , which restrict the detection to the bright , long - period cepheid population in this galaxy . on the other hand , this is the population most useful for the distance determination , which is the primary purpose of our project , and a sample of 23 cepheids with a period baseline of more than 100 days is very well suited for an accurate distance determination .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show the locations of the ngc 247 cepheids in the v , v - i color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , where they delineate the expected cepheid instability strip ( chiosi et al . 1992 ; simon & young 1997 ) .",
    "three stars in table 5 are missing in this plot because we could not measure their i - band light curves ( objects cep001 , cep002 and cep013 ) .",
    "while the eighteen brightest cepheids in our sample delineate the instability strip very well , supporting their correct identification as cepheid variables , the two faintest cepheids in our sample appear too blue for their periods and seem to be placed beyond the blue edge of the cepheid instability strip .",
    "while this is likely to be attributed to the relatively low accuracy of the photometric data for these two stars , it could also mean that these objects are not cepheids , which we consider very unlikely however from an inspection of their light curves . in any case",
    ", as discussed in the following section of this paper , these two variables are excluded from our distance determination for ngc 247 .    in table 6 , we report our individual v and i band observations of the discovered cepheids .",
    "the full table 6 is available in the electronic edition of the journal .",
    "in figures 4 , 5 and 6 we show the pl relations in the v , i and wesenheit bands ( the latter defined in the usual way ) resulting from the data from table 5 . for the distance determination from these diagrams ,",
    "we adopt the eighteen cepheids in the period range from 27.8 to 73.3 days .",
    "the variables with smaller periods in table 5 were excluded from the distance analysis because they might be affected by a malmquist bias , given that their mean magnitudes are relatively close to the cutoff in our photometry ( see fig .",
    "we also exclude the one very long - period variable at 131.3 days because such very luminous cepheids might not obey the linear pl relation defined by the shorter period ( less than 100 days ) variables ( e.g. freedman et al .",
    "1992 ; gieren et al . 2004 ) .",
    "such an effect is also predicted from theoretical models ( bono et al .",
    "although the 131.3 day cepheid in ngc 247 seems to perfectly fit the linear extension of the pl relation in both v and i , it carries a strong weight in the solution and we prefer not to use it in the distance calculation .    as in the previous papers in this series",
    ", we adopt the slopes of the cepheid pl relations as given by the ogle - ii project for the cepheids in the lmc ( udalski 2000 ) .",
    "these slopes are extremely well determined , with 1 @xmath16 errors of 0.021 , 0.014 and 0.008 in the v , i and the reddening - free wesenheit bands , respectively .",
    "least - squares fits to the observed pl relations in ngc 247 from our data yield slopes of -2.571 @xmath0 0.261 in v , -2.685 @xmath0 0.214 in i and -3.497 @xmath0 0.421 in @xmath17 , which are all consistent with the ogle lmc slopes within about 1 @xmath16 .",
    "this supports our adopted procedure to use the well - measured lmc cepheid pl relation slopes for the distance determination of ngc 247 .",
    "fitting the lmc cepheid pl relation slopes to our data of the 18 adopted cepheids ( indicated as filled circles in figs . 4 - 6 )",
    "yields the following equations : + v = -2.775 log p + ( 26.766 @xmath0 0.048 ) @xmath16 = 0.199 + i = -2.977 log p + ( 26.131 @xmath0 0.056",
    "@xmath16 = 0.229 + @xmath17 = -3.300 log p + ( 25.163 @xmath0 0.086 ) @xmath16 = 0.355 + if we fit the data of _ all _ cepheids in table 5 ( 23 stars ) with the same slopes , the zero points in the above pl relations change to 26.735 , 26.134 and 25.219 in v , i and the wesenheit index , respectively .",
    "this shows that our distance result for ngc 247 changes by less than 3% if we replace our adopted sample of 18 cepheids by the full sample of cepheids we detected and measured in ngc 247 , in any filter .",
    "if we take into account the small errors on the adopted lmc pl relation slopes in our calculation , the effect on the zero points of the ngc 247 pl relations is less tha 0.01 mag in each band , and therefore insignificant .    adopting , as in our previous papers , a value of 18.50 for the true distance modulus of the lmc , a value of 0.02 mag for the foreground reddening toward ngc 247 ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the reddening law of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( @xmath18 = 3.24 e(b - v ) , @xmath19 = 1.96 e(b - v ) ) we obtain the following absorption - corrected distance moduli for ngc 247 in the three different bands : + @xmath20 ( v ) = 28.135 @xmath0 0.048 + @xmath20 ( i ) = 27.998 @xmath0 0.056 + @xmath20 ( @xmath17 ) = 27.795 @xmath0 0.086 + these values suggest that in addition to the foreground reddening towards our target galaxy , there is substantial intrinsic reddening in ngc 246 affecting the cepheid magnitudes in v and i. we will determine this intrinsic component of the total reddening affecting the ngc 247 cepheids with high accuracy in a future study which will provide near - infrared photometry for the cepheids and combine it with the present optical vi data , as we did in previous papers of the araucaria project ( e.g gieren et al .",
    "2005a ) . from the distance moduli derived in the v and i bands , our current best estimate for",
    "the _ total _ mean reddening of the ngc 247 cepheids , including that produced in the galaxy itself , is e(b - v)=0.13 mag .",
    "this value of the total reddening brings the true distance moduli in the v and i bands in very good agreement with the value derived from the @xmath17 . as our present best determination of the true distance modulus of ngc 247",
    ", we adopt the value 27.80 @xmath0 0.09 mag ( random error ) derived from the reddening - free wesenheit magnitude .",
    "the corresponding distance of ngc 247 is ( 3.63 @xmath0 0.15 ) mpc and places the galaxy at about twice the distance of the other two sculptor group galaxies for which our project has provided accurate cepheid distances so far , ngc 300 ( gieren et al .",
    "2004 , 2005a ) and ngc 55 ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2007 , gieren et al . 2008 )",
    ". we will discuss our distance determination for ngc 247 and estimate its total uncertainty , including systematic errors , in the following section .",
    "the current distance determination to ngc 247 is the first one based on cepheid variables discovered in our present wide - field imaging survey .",
    "it is affected to some extent by the well - known sources of systematic error inherent in such studies which have been discussed in some detail in our previous wide - field cepheid surveys of araucaria galaxies mentioned in the introduction .",
    "these systematic error sources include the zero point of our photometry , possible problems with the cepheid sample itself ( overtone pulsators , malmquist bias , filling of the instability strip ) , blending of the cepheids with objects not resolved in the images , possible metallicity effects on the pl relation , reddening , and the adopted distance of the lmc to which the ngc 247 distance is tied .",
    "we will in turn discuss these factors and estimate their influence on our current distance determination .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , we have been very careful to determine the photometric zero points of the different sets of photometric data used in this study with the highest possible accuracy .",
    "our tests and discussion in section 2 lead us to believe that the photometric zero points of the common datasets in v and i are determined to better then @xmath0 0.03 mag in both bands .",
    "this is in agreement with our previous experience with datasets obtained with the same instruments and reduced and calibrated in the same way , which always led to photometric zero points whose accuracy was better than 2% .",
    "while the cepheid sample used in this study of about 20 stars is relatively small as compared to our previous surveys of other ( and nearer ) araucaria galaxies , it is still large enough to expect that an inhomogeneous filling of the instability strip is not a significant problem in the present case of ngc 247 .",
    "indeed , the dispersion of the positions of the cepheids in fig . 3 seems to indicate that the distribution of the cepheids in the instability strip is approximately random .",
    "this idea is supported by the fact that the effect of sample size , or adopted cutoff period on the distance solution is only @xmath21 2% in all bands , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "this same result also suggests that there is no significant malmquist bias affecting our distance result , in agreement with the fact that even the faintest cepheids in our sample are still about one magnitude brighter than the faintest stars in ngc 247 detected and measured from our images .",
    "also , we can clearly assume that our adopted cepheid sample has only fundamental mode pulsators , given that many studies have shown that overtone cepheids are restricted to periods smaller than about 6 days ( e.g. udalski et al .",
    "1999 ; gieren et al . 1993 ) .",
    "blending of the cepheids in ngc 247 used for the distance determination is potentially a more serious problem . in extrapolation of our result of the effect of blending on the cepheid - based distance of ngc 300 ( bresolin et al .",
    "2005 ) , which was found less than 2% , we would expect a slightly larger effect for ngc 247 due to its larger inclination as compared to ngc 300 , and the larger distance which both tend to increase the probability of significant blending with unresolved and relatively bright nearby stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative effect of blending decreases with the period of the cepheids ; longer - period cepheids are more luminous , and therefore the relative effect of a given unresolved companion star on its observed flux tends to be less important . since all cepheids in our sample used for the distance determination have periods longer than 27 days , and the mean period of the sample is about 50 days , our ngc 247 sample should be less affected in this regard than the sample in ngc 300 for which the mean period is considerably shorter ( about 30 days ; gieren et al . 2004 ) . from these considerations , we expect that any residual systematic effect on the ngc 247 distance due to blending of the cepheids should not exceed 4% , or 0.08 mag in the distance modulus . it should be noted that the sign of this error is to _ underestimate _ the true distance of the galaxy by such an amount .    the effect of metallicity on the pl relations in different bands has been discussed in some detail in the previous papers of this series .",
    "here we just note that for any of the araucaria target galaxies we have studied so far the observed slopes of the cepheid pl relations in the vijk bands were consistent with the respective slopes found in the lmc by the ogle - ii project in vi bands , and by persson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in the near - infrared bands .",
    "ngc 247 is no exception , as evident from figs . 4 , 5 and 6 ,",
    "although the slope is less well determined in the present case of ngc 247 due to the relatively small cepheid sample we were able to detect .",
    "the recent work of gieren et al .",
    "( 2005b ) , and of fouqu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) on galactic and lmc cepheid distances measured from the infrared surface brightness technique ( fouqu & gieren 1997 ) has confirmed that the slope of the cepheid pl relation does not change significantly with metallicity even for a solar abundance sample of cepheid variables .",
    "the effect of a possible nonlinearity of the pl relation at a period of 10 days discussed by ngeow et al .",
    "( 2008 ) does not affect the determination of distances of galaxies in any significant way .",
    "the question of the effect of metallicity on the zero point of the pl relation is less clear , at the present time , and it is one of the main goals to determine this effect by comparison of the cepheid distances of our target galaxies with those derived from other methods .",
    "however , the effect of metallicity on the pl relation zero points in vijk is certainly not dramatic and likely less than @xmath21 3% ( e.g. storm et al .",
    "2004 ; sakai et al .",
    "2004 ; macri et al .",
    "the generally very good agreement of our cepheid distances with those derived from the trgb method ( e.g. rizzi et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) for common galaxies seems to support the idea that the effect of metallicity on the pl zero point is small .",
    "for ngc 247 , the agreement of the trgb distance of 27.9 @xmath0 0.1 mag of davidge ( 2006 ) with our present value of 27.80 mag is clearly excellent .",
    "although we do not have any detailed information on the metallicity of the young stellar population in ngc 247 , it is likely more metal - rich than that of the less massive local group irregular galaxies wlm , ngc 3109 and ic 1613 for which the metallicity of young stars is about -1.0 dex ( bresolin et al .",
    "2006,2007 ; evans et al .",
    "2007 ) , suggesting that cepheid and trgb distances do agree well over a range of metallicities , and not only for very metal - poor galaxies .",
    "a detailed quantitative discussion of this issue will be given in a forthcoming paper of the araucaria project .",
    "any residual systematic effect of reddening on our present distance result adopted from the wesenheit pl relation should be small . in our previous cepheid studies",
    ", we have usually found that the distance of a galaxy derived from the @xmath17 magnitude pl relation agreed to within 2% with the one derived from our combined optical - near infrared technique ( gieren et al .",
    "2005a , 2006 , 2008a ; pietrzyski et al .",
    "2006c ; soszyski et al .",
    "this is in principle expected due to the reddening - free nature of the wesenheit magnitudes .",
    "however , the wesenheit band pl relations for more distant galaxies tend to show an increasing dispersion which is in the order of , or even surpasses the one observed in v and/or i , which is likely due to the combined effect of photometric errors and blending with unresolved nearby stars which affect the wesenheit magnitudes by increasing amounts . in our recent study of the wlm galaxy ( gieren et al .",
    "2008b ) , we find a distance from near - infrared data which is 0.09 mag shorter than the one we had previously obtained from the wesenheit index . in the case of ngc 247 , there might be an effect of similar order .",
    "future , planned infrared photometry of the cepheids in ngc 247 will allow to investigate this question and provide a more accurate distance determination to the galaxy .",
    "we estimate that the remaining systematic effect due to reddening on the present distance modulus determination for ngc 247 should not be larger than 4% . our planned infrared work on the ngc 247 cepheids will definitively prove or disprove the validity of our current estimation of the effect of reddening on the distance of ngc 247 .    finally ,",
    "there is the problem of the adopted lmc distance , which has been most recently discussed by schaefer ( 2008 ) .",
    "we do not wish to add to the discussion here , but just mention that some recent results for the distance modulus of the lmc using local open clusters ( an et al .",
    "2007 ) , revised hipparcos cepheid parallaxes ( van leeuwen et al . 2007 ) , and the infrared surface brightness technique ( fouqu et al . 2007 ) have yielded a somewhat shorter lmc distance , with values close to 18.40 mag . since all galaxy distance moduli reported in previous papers of the araucaria project have been tied to the same , assumed lmc distance modulus of 18.50 , we will retain this value here .",
    "therefore , their _ relative _ distances will not be affected should future work definitively change the adopted 18.50 mag value of the lmc distance .",
    "the distance of ngc 247 seems very well determined now . within their respective uncertainties ,",
    "the trgb distance of 27.9 @xmath0 0.1 mag of davidge ( 2006 ) and the tully - fisher distance determination of 27.87 @xmath0 0.21 mag of karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2006 ) agree with the present , first distance determination of the galaxy from cepheid variables .",
    "the new cepheid distance to ngc 247 reported in this paper has an uncertainty which is similar to the trgb measurement of the distance , but more accurate than the distance of this spiral derived from the tully - fisher method .    from the previous discussion",
    ", we estimate that the systematic uncertainty of our present distance determination is about 0.09 mag .",
    "this leads to a final , adopted value for the true distance modulus of ngc 247 of @xmath20 = 27.80 @xmath0 0.09 ( random ) @xmath0 0.09 ( systematic ) mag , corresponding to 3.63 mpc , with a total uncertainty of about 6% .",
    "we expect to improve on this value , and significantly reduce its uncertainty , with our planned near - infrared work on the ngc 247 cepheids .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper can be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "we have conducted an extensive wide - field imaging survey in the sculptor group spiral galaxy ngc 247 in the optical v and i bands which has led to the discovery of 23 cepheid variables with periods between 17 and 131 days .",
    "these are the first cepheid variables with published data reported in this galaxy .",
    "\\2 . from the periods and mean magnitudes of the cepheids derived from our photometry , we have constructed pl relations in the v , i and @xmath17 bands .",
    "the data define tight pl relations which are well fitted with the slopes of the corresponding lmc cepheid pl relations adopted from the ogle - ii project .",
    "we have derived reddened distances for the 3 bands , which lead to a determination of the total mean reddening of the ngc 247 cepheids of e(b - v ) = 0.13 mag . with an adopted foreground reddening towards ngc 247 of 0.02 from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we determine a reddening value of 0.11 produced _ inside _ ngc 247 and affecting its cepheid population .",
    "we adopt a final true distance modulus of 27.80 mag for ngc 247 from the reddening - free wesenheit magnitude pl relation , in very good agreement with the reddening - corrected values coming from the v and i bands . the total uncertainty on this distance value , including the contribution from systematic errors , is estimated to be @xmath0 6% .",
    "the cepheid distance to ngc 247 derived in this paper agrees very well , within the respective 1 @xmath16 uncertainties , with the recent determinations of davidge ( 2006 ) from the i - band trgb method , and of karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2006 ) from the tully - fisher method .",
    "the distance of ngc 247 of 3.63 mpc is about twice as large as the respective distances of two other sculptor group galaxies , ngc 300 ( gieren et al . 2005a ) and ngc 55 ( gieren et al .",
    "this supports the evidence that the sculptor group has a filament - like structure ( jerjen et al .",
