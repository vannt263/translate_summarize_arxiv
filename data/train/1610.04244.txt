    "<S> finally we show that the method can be generalized to higher - dimensional and multipartite cases with a complexity that scales linearly with the number of parties .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum entanglement provides many advantages beyond classical limits , including quantum communication , computation , and information processing  @xcite . yet , determining whether a given quantum state is entangled or not is a theoretically and experimentally challenging task  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the ideal approach of reconstructing the full quantum state via quantum tomography is practically infeasible for all but the smallest systems .    </S>",
    "<S> an elegant solution to this problem , known as entanglement witnessing , relies on the geometry of the set of all non - entangled ( separable ) quantum states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since these states form a convex set , it is always possible to find a hyperplane such that a given entangled state lies on one side of the hyperplane , while all separable states are on the other side , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wpc ] . </S>",
    "<S> this hyperplane is a so - called _ entanglement witness _ ( ew ) and corresponds to a joint observable that has a bounded expectation value over all separable quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> any quantum state that produces a value beyond the bound must therefore be entangled . </S>",
    "<S> this simplification , however , comes at a cost : first , different entangled states in general require different entanglement witnesses to be detected ; second , not every ew can be practically realized , i.e. ,  can be decomposed in terms of operators corresponding to available local measurement devices ( see also refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for examples of the reverse procedure : constructing ews from local observables ) ; third , when such a decomposition is possible , it might require multiple measurement devices ( with multiple settings ) to be implemented ; and fourth , witnessing bounds can be elusive in the presence of experimental imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , one would ideally like to construct ews that have a simple decomposition and , at the same time , detect a large set of entangled states .        </S>",
    "<S> there are three main techniques to improve ews . </S>",
    "<S> first , to use nonlinear ews by addition of nonlinear terms to the original witness operator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , by using collective measurement of ews on multiple copies of quantum states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> third , by optimizing a given witness to tighten the bound on the statistics of separable states as much as possible  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter , which we refer to as standard entanglement witnessing ( sew ) , is the most common procedure and enjoys the property that it can be used as a complementary procedure to the first two techniques . in sew one </S>",
    "<S> first evaluates the supremum ( infimum ) expectation value of the witness observable for all separable states . </S>",
    "<S> the witness operator is then decomposed into local measurements , such that the expectation value can be computed from the combined local measurement statistics . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison against the corresponding upper ( lower ) bound for separable states establishes the entanglement of the tested state . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , a significant amount of information from these measurements remains unused by combining the statistics .    in this letter , we introduce and demonstrate a novel approach for witnessing quantum entanglement that makes use of this otherwise unused additional information to seamlessly and easily enhance any existing witnessing protocol . </S>",
    "<S> our method , which we call _ ultrafine entanglement witnessing _ ( uew ) , relaxes the requirements on the test operators , which facilitates entanglement detection of a wide range of states , even if no witness decomposition in the common sense is provided . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our approach makes it possible to detect entanglement using only a simple measurement device for each party with the minimal number of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we implement this technique experimentally on two - qubit entangled states shared by alice and bob , each of whom has access to a fixed three - outcome measurement device . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that uew can straightforwardly be extended to multipartite scenarios , with an experimental complexity that scales linearly with the number of parties involved .    </S>",
    "<S> standard entanglement witnessing relies on the fact that the set of all separable states , @xmath0 , is the collection of all convex combinations of pure product states . as a fruitful consequence of this convexity </S>",
    "<S> , we can identify quantum states outside @xmath0 ( i.e. ,  entangled states ) as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the hahn - banach theorem implies that for every entangled state @xmath1 there exists a hyperplane cutting through the state space that separates @xmath1 from the set of separable states , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wpc ] . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , there exists a hermitian operator @xmath2 such that @xmath3 for all @xmath4 , while @xmath5  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath2 is called an _ </S>",
    "<S> entanglement witness_.    powerful ews are most commonly constructed by optimizing a hermitian ( and possibly completely positive ) _ test _ operator @xmath6 over the set of separable states as  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the identity operator , and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is sufficient to optimize only over pure product states @xmath10  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can also employ a similar recipe using the infimum value @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this optimization procedure can be geometrically understood as translating the hyperplane corresponding to the test operator until it is tangent to the set of separable states , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wpc ] . </S>",
    "<S> hence , there exists a pure product state , called the _ optimal point _ , </S>",
    "<S> for which @xmath12  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting ew is said to be the _ </S>",
    "<S> finest _ witness in the sense that any further shift of its corresponding hyperplane will lead to an operator whose expectation value becomes negative for some separable states , thus , violating the proper witnessing conditions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is , however , possible to significantly increase the detection power of any test operator by taking into account additional constraints and information about the states under investigation , which effectively reduces the size of the set of viable separable states , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wpc ] . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints reflect physical restrictions on the measurement statistics that can be produced by separable states in certain situations . </S>",
    "<S> similar considerations have previously been applied in the context of non - gaussianity detection  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider , for example , a system composed of two spin-@xmath13 particles , which , in a measurement along the @xmath14-axis , are always found either both with spin up , or both with spin down . </S>",
    "<S> there is a large number of separable states that can not produce such statistics and can thus be excluded from the optimization procedure for any witness aiming to detect the potential entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , the required information about the state is already available , but not used , in almost every standard witnessing experiment .    consider a hermitian operator @xmath15 corresponding to some physical observable . </S>",
    "<S> just like a witness , @xmath16 corresponds to a hyperplane cutting through the space of all quantum states , splitting it into two half - spaces @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a real - valued free parameter . depending on the choice of constant @xmath19 , the hyperplane @xmath16 may or may not cut through the set of separable states , defining the two closed convex subsets @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , whenever one of the sets is empty the other one coincides with the set of all separable states , and hence , our method reduces to sew . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the following , we will consider parameter values for which both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are nonempty . </S>",
    "<S> using the test operator @xmath6 one can now construct two ews , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , optimal to the sets @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , by replacing @xmath26 of eq .   with @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",

    "<S> this in particular implies that for a given @xmath19 one of the conditions in eq .   is advantageous over sew . </S>",

    "<S> now , the agents chose the test and constraint operators as @xmath105 and @xmath106 which implies that @xmath107 .    </S>",
    "<S> as a proof - of - principles , suppose that @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> in the supplemental material  @xcite , we prove that the maximum separable bound for a partition @xmath109 is given by @xmath110 since the test and constraint operators are invariant under the exchange of agents between different parties , so is the bound @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> three cases are of particular interest . </S>",
    "<S> first , if @xmath112 , then no partitioning has been made and @xmath113 represents the maximum expectation value of the test operator @xmath6 over _ all _ @xmath97-partite quantum states and hence , this bound can not be violated by any quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> second , if @xmath114 the resulting bound corresponds to the bipartitions for which there is one subsystem in one party and @xmath115 subsystems in the other . </S>",
    "<S> one can easily see that for any bipartition with @xmath116 , @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , any state violating this bound is entangled within all bipartitions and thus , genuinely @xmath97-partite entangled . finally , if @xmath118 each party constitutes one agent corresponding to the partition with the highest resolution , i.e. , @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , any state violating the bound @xmath120 is partially entangled .     versus the cardinality of the largest party @xmath121 for @xmath122 , where each @xmath97 is shown in a different color . for a state of interest with @xmath108 , a violation of </S>",
    "<S> the bound @xmath123 proves its ( partial ) entanglement , while a violation @xmath124 proves its genuine @xmath97-partite entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the case @xmath125 with the four black dots representing the four subsystem and the purple shaded boxes visualize the maximally allowed entangled subset . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : multipartite ] shows @xmath126 versus the cardinality of the largest party @xmath121 for @xmath122 . as @xmath97 increases it becomes increasingly harder to detect genuine @xmath97-partite entanglement with the simplest version of our approach . </S>",
    "<S> however , detecting partial entanglement by violating the bound @xmath123 remains experimentally feasible for larger @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> this example shows that our approach can be extended to the multipartite case , where it allows for simple entanglement detection with a number of measurements that scales as @xmath127 with the number of agents @xmath97 , as opposed to the tomographic methods or bell tests for which the number of measurements scales exponentially with the number of qubits  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , current ews require at least @xmath128 measurements for each agent , where @xmath129 is the minimum hilbert space dimension of the subsystems  @xcite , while our technique provides the possibility of detecting entangled states using only three - outcome measurements independent of the hilbert space dimensionality .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a novel procedure for witnessing quantum entanglement using additional information that is typically already available in a standard witnessing experiment . </S>",
    "<S> our ultrafine entanglement witnessing relaxes the requirements on the test operators and allows for entanglement detection with a much smaller number of measurements compared to the standard entanglement witnessing . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our procedure makes it possible to witness entanglement using a single fixed measurement - device for each party . </S>",
    "<S> this is a considerable experimental simplification which potentially allows for faster and more precise detection of entanglement compared to the existing protocols . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated this in practice for a family of two - qubit entangled states using two fixed three - outcome povms . </S>",
    "<S> we also showed that our method always performs at least as well as the standard procedure and seamlessly and easily improves it . </S>",
    "<S> we have described a scalable experimental protocol that generalizes to higher dimensional and multipartite quantum systems , and showed that , in its simplest form , the number of measurements required for this protocol scales linearly with the number of agents .
