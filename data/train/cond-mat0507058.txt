    "in mid-2002 , two semiconductor - optics experimental groups reported dramatic ring - shaped photoluminescence patterns when a focused laser was used to excite electron - hole pairs near a coupled quantum well system biased with an electric field @xcite . despite initial speculation invoking bose - einstein condensation of excitons",
    ", it was later found that the luminescence ring is well - explained by classical reaction - diffusion dynamics of the electrons and holes @xcite .",
    "the idea is that there is net hole injection into the quantum well near the laser irradiation spot , together with an electron source due to leakage current that is roughly uniform across the two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum well plane .",
    "this combination can lead to a charge - separated steady state configuration , with a circular hole - rich island sustained by the localized hole source in an electron - rich sea .",
    "the interface , where outward - diffusing holes recombine with inward - diffusing electrons , is the luminescence ring .",
    "the position of the interface , i.e. , the radius of the luminescence ring , is not well - understood theoretically , despite some theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite efforts . while a full understanding may or may not require extra ingredients in addition to the diffusion - reaction model @xcite , a thorough study of the behavior of the interface position _ within _ the diffusion model is certainly a necessary first step .",
    "the present article fills this gap by presenting a detailed analysis of the steady state , addressing aspects such as the position and width of interface , density distributions , etc .",
    "there are a number of length scales in the problem which we identify cleanly .",
    "the phenomenon is put into the context of previous theoretical studies of steady - state reaction fronts and variations thereof @xcite . by considering various possible relative values of the tunneling decay rates of the two carrier species ,",
    "we clarify the roles of the tunneling strengths in determining the steady - state configuration .",
    "a curious feature of the steady state is that the reaction zone has , in addition to the sharp interface , an extended feature on one side where the luminescence does not vanish but instead is a nonzero constant .",
    "this aspect turns out to have a drastic influence on the interface position and the overall steady - state structure , which we explain in detail .    in comparison with previous theoretically studied diffusion - annihilation systems @xcite",
    ", the present problem has several unusual features which justify an extended study .",
    "these include the single - particle ( tunneling ) decay of one or both species , and the fact that one of the reacting species has a spatially extended source spanning both sides of the interface .",
    "in addition , while diffusion - controlled reaction interfaces and patterns have been studied in a wide variety of chemical , biological and fluid flow contexts @xcite , they are rather novel in electronic systems . indeed , this may well be the only currently known example of a diffusion - limited nonequilibrium reaction front or pattern in electronic systems .",

    "our calculations are in the same spirit , but we have specific source and decay terms in addition , which play crucial roles .",
    "a related ( and more often studied ) phenomenon is that of time - dependent fronts , where two species are initially well - segregated @xcite .",
    "many of the same considerations apply , with powers of inverse time ( @xmath155 ) playing a similar role as the particle flux @xmath131 does in the steady - state case .",
    "geometries similar to ours have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , where one species of the reaction - annihilation pair forms an island in a sea of the other .",
    "we have limited ourselves to the mean - field diffusion - reaction equations . in principle , mean - field treatments are valid only above the critical dimension , which happens to be two . at and below the critical dimension ,",
    "fluctuations become important @xcite . in the 2d system of the present article",
    ", effects of fluctuations may show up in several ways .",
    "first , the form of the annihilation term we have used , @xmath67 , can be expected to have logarithmic corrections in 2d @xcite .",
    "logarithmic corrections are also expected for the power - law scaling of the width @xcite .",
    "we justify the mean - field approximation by noting that almost all the quantities we have considered involve large numbers of particles so that fluctuations are unimportant .",
    "we have assumed that the charged carriers annihilate directly , neglecting the diffusion , dissociation and quantum dynamics of bound exictons @xcite .",
    "exciton diffusion might cause the observed luminescence width to be larger than what corresponds to @xmath67 in our model , but the overall trends of sec .",
    "[ sect_width ] are not expected to be affected severely .",
    "we have also ignored possible effects of quantum degeneracy of the charged carriers , which could change the form of the diffusion terms , so that @xmath9 are themselves density - dependent @xcite .",
    "all effects of coulomb interactions , including screening effects from the conducting leads @xcite , have also been left out of our formulation .",
    "in their brief analytic treatment of the steady state , butov _ et .",
    "_ @xcite have assumed @xmath156 ( lack of hole tunneling decay ) and @xmath46 .",
    "our results of sec .",
    "[ sect_tauh ] allow an assessment of the @xmath156 approximation ( secs .",
    "[ sect_simple - model ] , [ sect_dark - region ] and ref .",
    "[ fig_tauh]a shows that it is reasonable for @xmath157 , but breaks down for smaller @xmath112 .",
    "since @xmath158 is typical in the experimental realizations , the @xmath159 results may well be experimentally relevant in some cases .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath46 approximation is more questionable .",
    "first , with the @xmath160 $ ] behavior , a relatively small change in @xmath35 can induce an orders - of - magnitude change in @xmath38 .",
    "this implies that fluctuations in the effective @xmath35 would cause the ring position to fluctuate wildly , so that the stable luminescence ring pattern would be unlikely to have been observed .",
    "( such fluctuations have also been observed in the numerical simulations for @xmath161 . )",
    "second , experimental data on the ring radius as a function of intensity @xcite show power - law behavior rather than any strong @xmath162$]-like behavior . while the relationship between @xmath35 and the intensity is not known , it is unlikely to compensate for the @xmath162 $ ] behavior and give power - law - like @xmath38-vs - intensity curves .",
    "it is therefore important to consider the @xmath47 case in detail , as we have done .",
    "we now comment on the experimental @xmath38 vs. intensity data @xcite . the non - monotonic behavior in fig . 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite strongly indicates that the dependence of the @xmath35 parameter of our model on the laser intensity is complicated .",
    "note that @xmath35 is an effective parameter measuring the amount of _ excess _ holes diffusing out of the laser irradiation region . to the best of the author s knowledge ,",
    "the process of generating excess holes has not been modeled carefully , and nothing is known conclusively about the @xmath35-intensity dependence .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , denev _ et .",
    "al . _ have suggested that the linear behavior of @xmath38 vs. intensity might be due to the importance of coulomb terms which are not included in the present diffusion - reaction model .",
    "however , if the effective @xmath35 parameter is a quadratic power of the intensity , our @xmath163 prediction for @xmath164 would also show up as a linear @xmath38-intensity result .",
    "our analytic results gives insight into other simulations , for example the numerical results in fig .",
    "1b of ref .",
    "the fact that this curve behaves roughly logarithmically at large @xmath38 ( large @xmath35 ) , rather than as a power law with exponent 1/2 , shows that the simulations were done using finite @xmath134 , with @xmath112 not too large compared to @xmath52 .",
    "note that the lambert @xmath121 function of eq .",
    "is roughly logarithmic for large arguments , @xmath165 .",
    "to summarize , motivated by semiconductor luminescence experiments , we have investigated a two - species inhomogeneous steady state arising from mean - field diffusion - annihilation equations with a localized source for one and an extended source for the other . if the holes are not allowed to have single - particle ( tunneling ) decay , our analysis predicts the density profiles and the radius of the ring - shaped interface with spectacular success .",
    "when both species are allowed to tunnel out , the quality of the analytic predictions is more modest .",
    "we have detailed the crossover between finite hole tunneling and zero hole tunneling behaviors of the interface position .",
    "the thorough study of the steady state within the diffusion - reaction model should serve as a baseline for evaluating the need to invoke additional physical effects for explaining experimental observations .",
