    "accurate stellar radii are important for the study of cepheid mass , pulsation and distance .",
    "direct radius measurements of bright , nearby cepheids allows for comparison to radii found by indirect and/or theoretical methods such as numerical models @xcite , the infrared flux method @xcite and surface brightness relations @xcite .",
    "these methods are easily applied to distant cepheids including those in nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "each of these indirect methods results in period - radius and period - radius - mass relations which yield different radii , and different masses , at very small and very large periods . from",
    "directly measured radii we may make comparisons with these relations . since there will always be cepheids too small or too faint for direct measurement ,",
    "the comparison between these indirect measurements and relations is crucial for the radius estimation of ever more distant cepheids .    at its current magnitude limit ( m@xmath6 @xmath75 ) and longest baseline ( 38 meters )",
    "the angular diameter of four cepheids are measurable with the npoi : @xmath2 cephei , @xmath1 geminorum , @xmath3 aquilae and @xmath0  ursae minoris ( hereafter polaris ) . in this paper",
    "we present mean angular diameters and compare linear radii for all four cepheids with those in the literature and with published period - radius , period - mass - radius , and period - mass relations . even though the sample is small , these four cepheids span an interesting range in pulsation period and characteristics .",
    "polaris and @xmath1 gem were observed over the course of two years .",
    "polaris was observed on 10 nights from september to november 1997 , while @xmath1 gem was observed for four nights : 12 october 1998 , and 20 , 23 and 24 february 1999 .",
    "the detailed observing strategy and data reduction techniques for obtaining mean angular diameters at the npoi are described in @xcite .",
    "@xcite present the specific observations and data reduction of @xmath2 cep and @xmath3 aql .",
    "comparisons between the reduction method employed by @xcite and that used in this work are made at the end of this section .",
    "briefly , as described in @xcite squared - visibilities are measured in each of 10 spectral channels , spaced evenly in wavenumber , ranging from 649 nm to 849 nm .",
    "a uniform - disk model is fit to the visibility data from which a uniform - disk diameter is derived .",
    "the uniform - disk diameters of polaris and @xmath1 gem are found to be 3.14 @xmath4 0.02 mas and 1.48 @xmath4 0.08 mas respectively . as reported in @xcite the uniform - disk diameters for @xmath2",
    "cep and @xmath3 aql are 1.46 @xmath4 0.02 mas and 1.65 @xmath4 0.04 mas respectively .",
    "figure 1 shows visibility data for the npoi s longest baseline ( east - west ) for each of the four cepheids .",
    "the data shown in figure 1 ( a ) - ( d ) are for the night listed in each .",
    "the mean uniform - disk diameter for each is the overall mean diameter determined for that cepheid .",
    "although limb - darkening of evolved stars has been directly observed with the npoi @xcite , those stars are three times larger than the cepheids in this study . at the spatial frequencies currently available to the npoi the visibility differences between limb - darkened and uniform - disks for such small stars",
    "is less than the scatter in the data . until the availability of longer baselines , limb - darkened diameters , @xmath8 , can be derived from uniform - disk diameters using a multiplicative conversion factor .",
    "this conversion factor is a single quadratic coefficient from @xcite interpolated for the cepheid s average specific gravity ( @xmath9 ) , average effective temperature , and for the mean central wavelength of the npoi bandwidth ( 740 nm ) .",
    "the bright star catalogue @xcite categorizes both @xmath1 gem and polaris as spectral type f7ib . for this spectral type @xcite give a @xmath9 of 1.71 and an effective temperature of 6000 k. using these values and the technique described in @xcite we derive a limb - darkened conversion factor ( ratio of limb - darkened diameter to uniform - disk diameter ) of 1.046 for both cepheids at 740 nm",
    "the uncertainty in this conversion factor is estimated to be on the order of 0.5% @xcite even for zeta gem , whose spectral type is very uncertain . with this derived limb - darkening coefficient",
    "we find a limb - darkened diameter of 3.28 @xmath4 0.02 mas for polaris and 1.55 @xmath4 0.09 mas for @xmath1 gem .    using this method in @xcite resulted in a limb - darkened diameter of 1.52 @xmath4 0.02 mas for @xmath2 cep and 1.65 @xmath4 0.04 mas for @xmath3 aql .",
    "@xcite use a different reduction method for the calibration of the raw visibility data for these two cepheids ( as well as two non - variable `` check - stars '' ) .",
    "in addition limb - darkened diameters are fit directly to the squared - visibility data without first calculating uniform - disk diameters .",
    "@xcite measure a limb - darkened angular diameter of 1.520 @xmath4 0.014 mas for @xmath2 cep and 1.69 @xmath4 0.04 mas for @xmath3 aql . for",
    "the non - variable star @xmath10 lac , @xcite derive a limb - darkened diameter of 1.909 @xmath4 0.011 mas while @xcite finds 1.92 @xmath4 0.02 mas . since these two different reduction methods produced diameters equal within the errors there is strong confidence in the robustness of the final results .",
    "the diameters for @xmath2 cep and @xmath3 aql used throughout the rest of this work are those of @xcite .",
    "finally , each of the four cepheids is part of a multiple system .",
    "if the npoi should detect light from more than one star , the visibilities measured will be depressed depending upon the position angle and separation of the system .",
    "if not taken into account this variation will have the effect of changing the model diameter that best fits the observed data .",
    "fortunately , each of the companions is either several magnitudes fainter than the cepheid being observed ( placing it well below the npoi s detection threshold ) , at a large enough separation ( @xmath1118 arcseconds ) that it is outside the npoi s photometric field of view , or both .",
    "for example , the companion to @xmath3 aql is 4.6 magnitudes fainter @xcite while at the same time being substantially bluer ( spectral type a1v compared to f6ib - g4ib for @xmath3 aql ) . since the visibilities from only the ten reddest channels are used to fit diameters , further chances of contamination by the companion are reduced .",
    "there is therefore no indication that there has been contamination of the measured diameters for any of the cepheids due to stellar companions .      where there is a measured trigonometric parallax , @xmath12 , the distance , @xmath13 , to the cepheid is the reciprocal of @xmath12 , and the linear radius is simply : @xmath14 all four cepheids have parallaxes measured by hipparcos @xcite , while @xmath2 cep and @xmath3 aql have additional parallaxes measured at the u.s .",
    "naval observatory flagstaff station ( h. harris , 1999 , personal communication ) .",
    "for these two cepheids , the distance and linear radius , are derived from the weighted mean of the two measured parallaxes : 3.60 @xmath4 0.53 mas for @xmath2 cep and 2.62 @xmath4 0.74 mas for @xmath3 aql .",
    "these linear radii are nearly model - independent ; what dependence there is enters from the conversion between uniform - disk and limb - darkened angular diameters , and as previously noted , is estimated to be at the level of @xmath70.5% of the mean radius . when the @xmath770 meter baseline at the npoi becomes operational spatial frequencies of @xmath7400 cycles per arcsecond will be accessible and at that time limb - darkened angular diameters for these stars can be measured directly .",

    "while still using the surface brightness technique for estimating cepheid diameters , @xcite find k and j - k ( as well as v - k ) photometry yield more accurate results than optical photometry , due to minimal effects of gravity and microturbulence on infrared fluxes . for periods",
    "less than 11.8 days , @xcite derive smaller radii than the other two methods .    for periods less than 48 days , which is the range within which all of the cepheids in this paper are found , the theoretical relation predicts a larger radius ( @xmath77% ) than that found from surface brightness relations .",
    "these representative p - r relations are shown in figure 2 along with the four cepheid radii measured at the npoi as given in table 1 .",

    "since the ratio of the first overtone period to the fundamental period is 0.71 , an overtone cepheid plotted on a p - r diagram using the log of the first overtone period instead of the fundamental period , will result in a radius larger than what the p - r relation would predict @xcite .",

    "the excellent agreement of polaris with these radii derived from published p - r relations is evidence of the overtone nature of polaris suggested by @xcite .",
    "in the same way that p - r relations yield radii from a known period , there are period - mass and period - radius - mass relations from which masses can be derived .",
    "the period - radius - mass relation of @xcite ,    @xmath35    when solved for mass yields    @xmath36    from this equation @xcite calculates masses for a sample of 101 cepheids using the radii of @xcite .",

    "compare this to polaris which has the highest radius precision and thus a mass uncertainty of only 17% .",
    "this percent error is slightly less than the 20% `` accidental '' error @xcite estimates for @xmath37 based on errors in their radii of @xmath77 - 8% .",
    "masses from two theoretical p - m relations are also listed in table 4 : evolution mass and pulsation mass @xcite .",
    "the evolution mass , @xmath44 , is calculated from stellar evolution theory :    @xmath45    whereas the pulsation mass , @xmath46 , is calculated from period - effective temperature relations :    @xmath47    figure 3 shows the three p - m relations relative to @xmath39 . as with the estimated error of @xmath37 the uncertainty in @xmath44",
    "is estimated to be on the order of 15 - 20% , while uncertainties in the effective temperature scale for cepheids are capable of bringing the pulsation mass relation into agreement with the evolution mass @xcite .",
    "direct diameter measurements will be able to address the uncertainties in this scale once one can directly measure cepheid diameter variations and thus calculate effective temperature as a function of pulsation phase to a precision limited only by the photometry . within the present uncertainties",
    "then , all three p - m relations are consistent with each other and the npoi masses .",
    "the cepheid @xmath3 aql , with a period @xmath77 days , possesses a bump in the descending phase of its radial velocity and light curves .",
    "radii for bump cepheids ( 6 days @xmath48 p @xmath48 20 days ) can be calculated using the bump phase and pulsation theory @xcite .",
    "there is a discrepancy , however , between the radius derived in this manner and the radius ( and hence mass ) derived from surface brightness techniques @xcite . for a cepheid such as @xmath3 aql",
    ", @xmath37 will be larger than the predicted bump mass .",
    "since the linear radius observed by the npoi for @xmath3 aql is larger than derived by @xcite , @xmath39 will be larger than @xmath37 and therefore in even worse agreement with the mass from the predicted bump phase method ( although the error in @xmath39 is quite large owing to the large parallax uncertainty ) .",
    "recent theoretical models of bump cepheids by @xcite using full amplitude , nonlinear , convective models ( with no convective core overshooting ) result in a cepheid mass of 6.9 @xmath4 0.9 m@xmath5 for a period of 11.2 days .",
    "this result agrees well with the wesselink mass of equation ( 4 ) for a 11.2 day cepheid which yields m@xmath49 = 6.85 m@xmath5 .",
    "although @xcite calculate the mass , and thus make their comparison to @xcite for a p = 11.2 day cepheid , the implication is that the disagreement between observation and theory has been resolved in the matter of bump cepheid masses with a resolution in favor of the larger wesselink mass , and thus closer to @xmath39 in table 4 .",
    "the agreement between polaris and @xmath2 cep and the curve for @xmath50 is less significant than it would at first seem since the method for calculating @xmath39 is based upon the same theory as that used for calculating @xmath50 . in the same way that it is desirable to compare the model - independent cepheid radii of table 1 to radii derived through indirect methods ,",
    "the same should be done for mass . a number of cepheids are located in binary systems ( including all four cepheids in this study as noted earlier ) .",
    "already @xcite have used spectroscopy to calculate the masses of five cepheids in binaries : u aql , s mus , v350 sgr , y car , su cyg .",
    "using ground based optical and satellite ultraviolet spectra the mass ratio of the two members of the binary were found .",
    "inferring the mass of the companion based on the spectral type yielded the mass of the cepheid .",
    "these five cepheids are plotted in figure 3 as open circles and show good agreement with the p - m relations and the npoi observations . with long enough baselines ,",
    "optical interferometry will be able to image the orbits of cepheids as has already been done for binaries of non - cepheids @xcite . in conjunction with radial velocities from spectroscopy ,",
    "all the orbital elements of the system , including the mass and distance , will be directly determined and independent of all models .",
    "at the present time only four cepheids have had their diameters measured with the npoi . over the next two years",
    "as the longest baseline available increases from 38 meters to 440 meters , the number of cepheids resolvable and the precision of their measurements will increase by at least a factor of five .",
    "figure 2 shows that at the present the measured linear radii are consistent with each of the published p - r relations . with the increased precision of the angular diameter measurements , and the increased precision of parallax observations ( also undertaken at the usno ) it will be possible to differentiate between the various p - r relations which are seen to diverge in figure 2 for periods shorter than 30 days",
    "this is precisely the range of periods for which cepheids observable by the npoi are located .",
    "optical long baseline interferometry has successfully measured the mean angular diameters of the four brightest cepheid variables in the northern sky .",
    "these angular diameters coupled with trigonometric parallaxes have produced virtually model - independent linear radii .",
    "these radii are compared to radii in the literature which have been derived from a variety of baade - wesselink , or surface brightness , methods .",

    "the derived linear radius is in marginal agreement with the optical surface brightness results but it is in very good agreement with the radius estimated from infrared spectroscopy by @xcite . for polaris the radius precision ( 6% ) is high enough that we are able to confirm its overtone nature . at a period of 3.97 days a radius of 46 @xmath4 3 r@xmath5",
