    "ultrafast magnetization dynamics are important for determining the data rate ( @xmath6 1ghz ) of magnetic information storage.@xcite recent advances in time - domain measurement techniques have provided clear pictures of the ensemble@xcite and sub - micron spatial@xcite response of magnetization to short magnetic field pulses , governed by the landau - lifshitz ( ll ) or -gilbert ( llg ) equations . the ll relaxation rate @xmath7 or gilbert damping @xmath8 determines the characteristic time for the magnetization to relax into new equilibria .",
    "characteristic times are given by @xmath9 ( ll ) or @xmath10 ( llg ) and are on the order of 2 ns in ni@xmath1fe@xmath2(50 nm )",
    ".    dilute concentrations of rare - earth ( re ( dopant atoms can be used to increase the damping of the precession in ni@xmath1fe@xmath2 , speeding the return of magnetization to equilibrium.@xcite terbium ( tb , 0 - 10% ) has been shown to provide roughly two orders of magnitude of enhancement in @xmath8@xcite , from @xmath11 .",
    "the contributed damping has been found to be general for lanthanide dopants sm - ho , with effectiveness scaling roughly with the nominal orbital moment @xmath12 of the dopant @xmath13 shell.@xcite .",
    "consistent with this idea , and with early measurements of fmr linewidth in re - substituted yig@xcite , gd dopants have shown no significant effect on damping .",
    "direct evidence has not been available previously to link re impurity magnetization states to precessional damping , either in yig or in modern thin - film magnetic systems .",
    "the rare earth magnetization is usually approximated as that of an isolated @xmath13 shell , occupied as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the atomic number of the re impurity ; spin , orbital , and total moments ( @xmath16 ) are calcuated using hund s rules .",
    "this approach yields moments which agree well with experimental moments except for metallic lanthanides near eu@xcite ; measurement of the magnetic character of gd and tb in a metallic alloy is therefore worthwhile .",
    "x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) is an ideal tool to characterize the magnetic character of re dopants .",
    "orbital and spin moments @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be measured separately on individual atomic sites using sum rules@xcite .",
    "high resolution xmcd data have been measured previously in tb single crystals at m@xmath0 edges@xcite and in gd single crystals at the m@xmath19 edge@xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , however , sum rules have not yet been applied to the dilute re impurities in transition metal ferromagnets relevant for controlled damping .",
    "we have used xmcd to measure spin to orbital moment ratios of gd and tb ( 2% ) in ni@xmath1fe@xmath2(50 nm ) .",
    "we show that for these elements , the calculated @xmath20 ratios from a @xmath14 shell are verified .",
    "a fivefold enhancement in ghz relaxation rate from tb dopants is accompanied by a large orbital moment fraction on the tb site , indicating that spin - lattice coupling is decisive in enhancing relaxation .",
    "films were deposited and magnetization dynamics were measured using methods described in ref .",
    "ni@xmath1fe@xmath2 ( 50 nm ) thin films were prepared with 2% atomic concentrations of gd and tb .",

    "doping concentrations were measured as 1.7% of gd and 1.8% of tb using rutherford backscattering spectroscopy ( rbs ) .",
    "the top surface of the films was protected by a 20  ta cap layer    magnetization dynamics of the thin films were characterized using time - domain pulsed inductive microwave magnetometry ( pimm ) .",
    "measured waveforms are proportional to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the in - plane angle of the magnetization .",

    "magnetization dynamics were measured within one day of deposition ; samples were stored in a dessicator for less than a week before xmcd measurement .",
    "xmcd measurements were taken in total electron yield mode ( tey ) at the uv ring of the national synchrotron light source ( nsls ) , brookhaven national laboratory , beamline u4b.@xcite xmcd was measured for fixed circular photon helicity , 75% polarization , with pulsed magnetization switching ( @xmath26 ) at the sample ; photon incidence was fixed at 45@xmath27 with respect to the sample normal .",
    "the samples were mounted with magnetic easy axis along the applied field direction ; measurements taken at remanence and in a saturating field were not found to differ appreciably .",
    "xmcd measurements with @xmath28 measured first and @xmath29 measured second were averaged with measurements taken in reversed order ( `` duplex mode '' ) , to correct for any drift in the monochromator which might lead to derivative - like artifacts in xmcd .",
    "xmcd measurements were divided by the factor @xmath30 to correct for non - grazing incidence and incomplete circular polarization .",
    "sample tey currents were normalized to tey currents measured at a reference grid ( i@xmath31 ) , located ahead of the sample , to correct for any variation in beam intensity over the measurement .",
    "photon energies could be varied continuously in the experiment from 500 - 1350 ev using a grating monochromator , with a general drop in beam intensity towards higher photon energies .",
    "high photon energies ( 1130 - 1320 ev ) were calibrated using electron yield signals from inline eu@xmath32o@xmath33 and dy@xmath32o@xmath33 powder references , taking re edge positions for the oxides reported in ref .",

    "the fast risetime pulse is applied at @xmath34 .",
    "it can be seen that the tb - doped sample experiences a much larger damping of magnetization motion than do the undoped or gd - doped samples .",
    "this behavior can be connected with the materials parameter @xmath7 through the ll equation ( si units ) ,    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the magnetization , @xmath37 is the effective applied field including demagnetizing and anisotropy components , @xmath38 is the gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath7 is the relaxation rate in @xmath39 .",

    "the xmcd measurement verifies an important criterion for an atomistic basis of contributed damping in doped ni@xmath1fe@xmath2 .",
    "it has been proposed that the presence of spin - orbit coupling is essential for the damping of uniform precession by electronic excitations@xcite which can ultimately be absorbed by a phonon and dissipated as heat .",
    "rare - earth elements can provide local centers for spin - orbit coupling : the orbital moment of the re can couple to the fe , ni spin system through the re spin moment .",
    "a necessary criterion for this mechanism is the presence of an orbital moment on re sites which enhance the damping .",
    "we have validated its presence in tb and absence in gd .",
    "we have seen that xmcd characterization of tb and gd dopants in ni@xmath1fe@xmath2 reveals a large orbital moment fraction on tb sites , accompanied by a large increase in precessional damping , but zero orbital moment on gd , with no effect on precessional damping .",
