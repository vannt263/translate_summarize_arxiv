    "the laminar - turbulent transition of boundary layers is of large importance in several practical applications and in particular for the aeronautical industry .",
    "naturally it occurs when external disturbances affect the near wall region , generating turbulent spots ( emmons @xcite ) occurring randomly and growing uniformly independently of one another as they are swept downstream by the flow .",
    "more efficiently , the transition can be promoted by inserting solid obstacles on a smooth wall at a certain distance from the leading edge .",
    "therefore the shape of the elements may play an effect on the location at which the flow becomes turbulent .",
    "the tripping device can be obtained by a series of obstacles widely separated ( thee - dimensional ) or by a wire in the whole span ( two - dimensional ) .",
    "different scenarios can be achieved , for the former configuration the transition can be classified as a wake instability , which is associated to the generation of vorticity layers at the obstacle walls which evolve in the streamwise direction . for disturbances in the whole span of the plate an inflectional point in the velocity profile inside the recirculating region behind the obstacle appear . therefore the small disturbances grow rapidly and a turbulent flow is generated in the whole boundary layer .",
    "klebanoff @xcite wrote an exhaustive paper on the transition of boundary layers induced by solid elements , claiming that two - dimensional obstacles are more efficient to excite three - dimensional disturbances than the oscillating ribbon previously used ( klebanoff @xcite ) .",
    "the klebanoff study had such impact that this type of laminar - turbulent transition was defined as klebanoff transition .",
    "klebanoff @xcite used hemispherical obstacles with an aspect ratio equal to @xmath1 and height @xmath2 smaller than the boundary layer thickness @xmath3 .",
    "they compared the values of the transition reynolds number ( @xmath0 , where @xmath4 is the velocity of the undisturbed flow at the top of the element ) with those obtained in other experimental setup .",
    "large differences were found , for instance their value equal to @xmath5 was different than those in tani @xcite , varying between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "dryden @xcite emphasized that , once the transition occurred , a further increase of the reynolds number had the effect of moving the location of the transition upstream .",
    "the reasons of the differences in the critical @xmath8 depend on the nature of the laminar - turbulent transition .",
    "for instance for isolated obstacles it occurs at a certain distance from the obstacle rather smoothly , and each scholar used different criteria to establish when the turbulent flow is assessed . in the discussion of the results",
    "klebanoff @xcite claimed that the shape of the obstacle plays a role and that the data in literature were limited . for us",
    "this assertion is still true and hence it has been decided to give a contribution to understand the effects of the shape of the obstacles by numerical simulations .",
    "the klebanoff s transition was reconsidered experimentally and numerically by bake @xcite .",
    "however , the dns was performed by taking the disturbances from the experiments and it was observed that the vortical structures responsible for the transition consisted in series of @xmath9-shaped vortices .",
    "ergin & white @xcite , analysing the experimental results , related the transitional mechanism to the shape of the optimal disturbances producing the largest growth over a specified distance or time .",
    "they claimed that these disturbances are similar to those produced by three - dimensional obstacles .",
    "flow visualizations as that by acarlar & smith @xcite have shown that three - dimensional obstacles in a laminar boundary layer generate horseshoe vortices wrapping around the upstream side of the obstacle with the two legs downstream .",
    "flow visualizations are qualitative and quantitative measurements are difficult , in particular to have insights on the effect of the shape of the obstacle .",
    "acarlar & smith @xcite for clear flow visualizations used obstacles with @xmath10 different from those typical of the tripping devices and different from those used by klebanoff @xcite .",
    "therefore , they got different profiles for the streamwise velocity fluctuations . in discussing the reason of the differences and on the possibility to find a scaling of the transition , klebanoff @xcite were asking for further investigations .",
    "ergin & white @xcite designed their experiments to understand the flow behavior in the kendall s near and far wake ( kendall @xcite ) . in the near wake region",
    "the energy of the disturbance decreases ; in the far wake , depending on the reynolds number , the growth is similar to the optimal growth predicted by the theory .",
    "ergin & white @xcite used an array of cylindrical elements separated by a distance such that the elements can be considered isolated .",
    "they did not change the shape of the obstacles and they still used the critical @xmath8 as a parameter to establish when the flow becomes turbulent .",
    "our opinion is that @xmath8 can not mark the transition from laminar to turbulent flow .",
    "the @xmath8 should be replaced by a quantity related to the velocity disturbance generated by the solid obstacle . in wall",
    "bounded turbulent flows the normal to the wall velocity fluctuations ( @xmath11 ) are those producing the turbulent reynolds stress @xmath12 characteristic of the turbulent regime ( the index @xmath13 indicates streamwise , @xmath14 normal and @xmath15 spanwise directions , angular brackets @xmath16 averages in the homogeneous directions and in time ) .",
    "these fluctuations produce also @xmath17 , the only normal stress entering in the mean momentum equations , for channel and pipes . for boundary layers other stresses appear , but the relative terms are one order of magnitude smaller . in wall bounded flows the importance of @xmath17 was not emphasized in the early experiments , designed to understand the physics of the near wall turbulence , for the difficulties to measure @xmath18 , close to a wall , by hot wires . in numerical simulations",
    "all the quantities are available and in addition the boundary conditions at the surface can be arbitrarily varied .",
    "for instance , in turbulent channels , orlandi @xcite demonstrated that , the normal velocity distribution on the plane of the crests is the driving mechanism for the modifications of the near wall structures .",
    "the preliminary results suggested that , a new parametrisation for rough flows could be obtained by @xmath19 , with @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ndicates values at the plane of the crests ) . a continuous transition between smooth ( @xmath22 ) and rough walls ( @xmath23 ) was observed .",
    "the importance of this quantity has been further emphasized by orlandi @xcite performing dns of transitional channels with different type of solid disturbances in one wall of the channel .",
    "it was observed that the flow in the channel becomes turbulent when @xmath24 ( the superscript @xmath25 indicates wall units ) .",
    "however when this threshold is achieved , the smallest value for turbulent flows is @xmath26 . by increasing the reynolds number",
    "there is a growth of this stress tending to a value approximately equal to @xmath1 , which is also the value of the maximum @xmath27 in smooth pipes or channels .",
    "bake @xcite introduced normal velocity disturbances at the wall derived by laboratory experiments designed ad hoc . from the previous arguments a similarity between a solid obstacle and a distribution of @xmath18 at the wall , for instance a round jet ,",
    "does exist .",
    "therefore for rough boundary layers @xmath28 could be a quantity whose value when overcomes a threshold value detect the laminar - turbulence transition . regarding the transition this quantity can not replace the @xmath8 criterium because it can not be apriori extimated , but qualitatitevely it can help to design the optimal shape of the obstacle producing the highest value at the top , this is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "the strategy to change the shape of the obstacle helps to demonstrate that @xmath8 can not mark the transition .",
    "in fact for certain geometries the transition may occur and for others no , even if @xmath8 does not largely varies .",
    "a further interest is to investigate whether the numerical simulation of a laminar inlet flow past a solid obstacle can be an affordable procedure to get turbulent boundary layers at high reynolds number . to reach these goals",
    "it is necessary to understand which tripping device gives the fastest growth and to have a quantitative measure of the transitional distance necessary to get a fully turbulent regime .",
    "the first dns of boundary layers by spalart @xcite used a pseudo - spectral numerical method together with a fringe method to recycle the output flow to the inlet .",
    "more sophisticated recycling methods were developed as reported by pirozzoli & bernardini @xcite in dns of compressible turbulent boundary layers .",
    "simens @xcite asserted that with a distance of @xmath29 momentum initial thickness the influence of the artificial inlet conditions are eliminated .",
    "lee @xcite used similar inlet conditions in presence of rough walls . in these conditions the disturbances , continuously emanating from the interior of the rough surfaces , reduce the distance to achieve a fully turbulent rough boundary layer .",
    "wu & moin @xcite simulated the whole transitional flow by adding to the potential flow patches of isotropic turbulence .",
    "this disturbance can be considered an attempt to reproduce the conditions in wind tunnels similar to those by emmons @xcite , where turbulence grows as random organised turbulent spots .",
    "more recently schlatter @xcite used a low - amplitude trip force acting in the wall - normal direction . in this way they had a rapid laminar - turbulent transition close to the inlet",
    "the authors did not furnish the velocity distributions so it is difficult to connect the disturbance to a real tripping device .    with the exception of the dns of rough boundary layers ( lee @xcite ) the numerical methods in the mentioned simulations",
    "did not allow to reproduce the flow interaction with solid obstacles . the numerical method used in this paper ( orlandi & leonardi @xcite )",
    "is based on a second order finite difference method and on an immersed boundary technique ( ibm ) to reproduce bodies of any shape .",
    "the method was tested in previous papers and in particular it was shown by orlandi @xcite that the pressure distribution on the rod - shaped elements was in a very good agreement with those measured by furuya @xcite .",
    "in addition a combined experimental - numerical study ( burattini @xcite ) was performed to validate the dns , with square bars with @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the spacing between two elements ) .",
    "the basic numerical method requires small modifications to deal with boundary layers .",
    "radiative outlet boundary conditions allow to the vortical structures to exit smoothly from the computational domain .",
    "the modifications in time and space of the three components of the vorticity fields , near the solid element , allows to understand why at the same reynolds number for some geometries are amplified and for others are not .",
    "a comparison between coarse and refined simulations ( not presented ) suggests that the inaccurate representation of the surface acts as disturbances reducing the critical reynolds number , therefore small inperfections in a solid obstacle while do not change @xmath8 would enhance the transition , this is a further reason of the inadequacy of @xmath8 to mark the transition .",
    "the basic numerical method consists of a second order finite difference scheme with staggered velocities , which in the inviscid limit conserves total energy .",
    "the method for the channel is described in orlandi @xcite where the global conservation properties in presence of non - uniform grids in the normal directions are presented .",
    "the boundary layers simulations require inlet , outlet and initial conditions .",
    "the radiative conditions at the outlet ( pauley @xcite ) allow the flow vortical structures to exit from the computational domain without producing disturbances , which propagating backwards can affect the flow . in these circumstances ,",
    "a cos fft is necessary to have a direct flow solver for the elliptic equations necessary to have a solenoidal velocity field . at the inlet",
    "a blasius velocity profile is imposed by fixing the reynolds number and the distance from the leading edge .",
    "the theory of laminar boundary layers allows to derive at @xmath32 the streamwise and normal velocity profiles in the entire computational domain .",
    "this two - dimensional flow is replicated in the whole spanwise direction , and small random disturbances are added at the inlet to trigger the spanwise disturbances , which , interacting with the large scale created by the obstacles at the supercritical reynolds number , produce a turbulent flow .    the navier - stokes and the continuity equation in dimensionless form , are    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the dimensionless pressure",
    ". the reynolds number is defined as @xmath35 , being @xmath36 the constant free - stream velocity and @xmath3 the boundary layer thickness at the inlet section ( usually indicated as @xmath37 ) .",
    "the solid element is located at a distance @xmath38 from the inlet , whose effect on the flow is reproduced by an immersed boundary technique . the efficiency of the method together with the mpi ( message parallel interface ) instructions allow to use a sufficient number of grid points to describe the body surface .",
    "the ibm method differs from that developed by fadlun @xcite , where the velocities at the nearest points to the surface were evaluated by interpolations .",
    "indeed orlandi & leonardi @xcite , after the evaluation of the right hand side of the discretized equations in the regular grid , correct the viscous terms , in the explicit and implicit step . for the flows here considered where the obstacles do not move ,",
    "the metrics coefficients at the nearest points are calculated only once initially .",
    "a first set of simulations were performed on a coarse grid with @xmath39 points in the streamwise and spanwise directions respectively . in the normal direction",
    "a non - uniform grid was used with @xmath40 grid points for @xmath41 and @xmath40 for @xmath42 .",
    "the three - dimensional solid obstacles have aspect ratio equal to @xmath1 and a dimensionless height @xmath43 .",
    "the computational box , for the coarse simulations , has @xmath44 and @xmath45 . with these parameters",
    "the solid elements are described by @xmath46 points in @xmath47 and @xmath48 and @xmath49 points in @xmath50 .",
    "such coarse grid was chosen on the purpose to investigate the dependence of the results on the shape of the element .",
    "three - dimensional solid disturbances with cylindrical , cubic and wedge shape were used .",
    "the experimental results described by klebanoff @xcite showed that two - dimensional obstacles behave differently than three - dimensional obstacles .",
    "therefore an additional set of simulations with a square rod , located at the same distance from the inlet ( @xmath51 ) were performed .",

    "the latter did not largely differ from that for the wedge .",
    "it was also observed that for square bars the critical reynolds number was much smaller than that for the three - dimensional obstacles . from these results",
    "it was decided to look at the transition mechanism for the cubic obstacle by varying the @xmath60 number in a well resolved simulations with @xmath61 grid points in a domain with the same size above cited .",
    "the obstacles is , then , descibed by @xmath62 grid points in @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the occurrence of transition was detected by monitoring the time evolution of of @xmath63 at @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "as it was previously mentioned , an unsteady simulation evolves towards a stationary condition , that depending on the value of @xmath66 remains laminar or becomes turbulent . in both cases the transient time necessary to the disturbance , produced by the obstacle , to reach the outlet boundary , depends on @xmath67 .",
    "figure [ fig1]a shows the trends at @xmath56 , where upstream of the obstacle is found a high positive peak , due to the formation , of the opposite sign vorticity characterising the head of the horseshoe vortex . behind and close to the obstacle the other positive peak is due to the three - dimensional separation bubble , which does not depend on time , and weakly is affected by @xmath60 .",
    "when the flow reattaches the wall vorticity varies with @xmath60 and with time . the profiles at low @xmath60 show that the negative bump",

    "<S> results of numerical simulations obtained by a staggered finite difference scheme together with an efficient immersed boundary method are presented to understand the effects of the shape of three - dimensional obstacles on the transition of a boundary layer from a laminar to a turbulent regime . </S>",
    "<S> fully resolved direct numerical simulations ( dns ) , highlight that the closer to the obstacle the symmetry is disrupted the smaller is the transitional reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> it has been also found that the transition can not be related to the critical @xmath0 used in the past . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations highlight the differences between wake and inflectional instabilities , proving that two - dimensional tripping devices are more efficient in promoting the transition . </S>",
    "<S> simulations at high reynolds number demonstrate that the reproduction of a real experiment with a solid obstacle at the inlet is an efficient tool to generate numerical data bases for understanding the physics of boundary layers . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the numerical method to fully resolve the small scales , that is one ingredient for a dns was shown by a comparison of the exponential range of the velocity spectra , in kolmogorov units , with those for isotropic turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the good comparison reinforces the idea of local isotropy at the smallest scales .    </S>",
