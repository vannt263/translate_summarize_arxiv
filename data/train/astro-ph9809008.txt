    "the intrinsic luminosity of an object is estimated using the luminosity distance to the object .",
    "this distance is usually derived assuming a robertson - walker model of the universe where the matter is uniformly and homogeneously distributed in space , the so - called filled - beam distance ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the matter , as we know it however , is comprised of compact objects such as stars and galaxies , and has a clearly inhomogeneous distribution .",
    "the opposite extreme to the filled - beam case is the so called empty - beam case , where all the matter is in the form of compact objects far from the the line - of - sight ; the derived distance being called the empty - beam distance ( @xmath4 ) . in this latter case the weak lensing of the rest of the universe de - magnifies the source relative to the filled - beam case .",
    "although reality may be somewhere between these two extremes ( simulations indeed show that the intermediate case is more representative of the actual matter distribution , see below ) it is clearly important to see to what extremes the matter distribution can affect the derived luminosity .",
    "recently several authors have re - examined this phenomenon with detailed investigations of the expected range of magnification effects expected in various model cosmologies ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these results , which build on earlier works such as ostriker & vietri ( 1986 ) , and dyer & roeder ( 1973 ) , demonstrate that in most commonly acceptable cosmologies the probability distribution of the observed magnitude is strongly peaked intermediate to the empty and filled - beam cases ( the skewness depending largely on whether the lensing matter is distributed as points or more diffusely , the former skewing magnitudes significantly towards the empty - beam , de - magnified , case ) .",
    "however a tail to high magnification exists , so sources may also be brightened .    in this short paper",
    "we point out the relevance of this effect to grbs and their host galaxies , we also present a simple diagram for reading off the extreme case of empty vs filled beam demagnification factors for various cosmologies .",
    "we present the estimated energy output of several grbs and the range allowed due to de - magnification effects , as well as the range of effects on the host galaxy magnitudes .",
    "since the bolometric luminosity for a given flux / apparent magnitude varies as the square of the luminosity distance ( @xmath5 ) we estimate here the maximum possible difference in inferred luminosity as the ratio @xmath6 . in figures 1 and 2 we plot this luminosity factor as a function of the cosmological density parameter , @xmath7 , and redshift , @xmath8 , for both open and flat ( non - zero cosmological constant , @xmath9 ) universes .",
    "the relevant equations are given in dyer & roeder ( 1973 ) and fukugita et al ( 1992 ) .",
    "several features are worth noting .",
    "first , as expected , the higher the matter density the larger the luminosity factor between empty and filled beam estimates since the empty beam will be in higher contrast to the rest of the universe as @xmath7 increases .",
    "second , the luminosity factors are fairly small for @xmath10 , at most @xmath11% , but by @xmath12 can rise as high as @xmath13% ( for @xmath14 ) .",
    "in table 1 we summarize the current data on grbs with identified hosts and measured redshifts ( note : grb 970228 has a redshift estimated from photometric colours ; sahu et al .",
    "1997a , fruchter et al . , 1998 ) . in the final column",
    "we give the range of intrinsic grb energies if the sources have been demagnified .",
    "these energies represent the extreme case of empty - beam demagnification for flat ( @xmath15 ) cosmologies with @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath14 values are given to illustrate the effect of the overall cosmology .",
    "the burst grb971214 is subject to the largest possible underestimate of intrinsic energy ( odewahn et al .",
    "1998 ) , by a factor of 2 , to a maximum of @xmath1 ergs .",
    "recently hogg & fruchter ( 1998 ) have shown how the distribution of grb host galaxy magnitudes ( @xmath18 , and one with @xmath19 ) appears to be biased towards the fainter end of the expected magnitude distribution , based on measured and inferred redshifts .",
    "the bias results in an apparent deficit in hosts with @xmath20 , albeit at low significance . while there are clearly other potential reasons for such a bias the possibility that at least some fraction of these high - z objects have been de - magnified to lower apparent magnitudes can not be discounted .",
    "a luminosity factor of @xmath21 ( a plausible ` typical ' maximum factor over the redshift range @xmath22 , a range expected from the star - formation history of the universe ( sahu et al .",
    "1997b ; hogg & fruchter , 1998 ) ) results in a magnitude shift of @xmath23 which could account for a significant amount of the faint end bias .",
    "even a more realistic factor of 1.2 ( @xmath24 magnitudes ) which might be expected from detailed simulation , e.g. wambsganss , cen , & ostriker ( 1998 ) helps alleviate the dearth of brighter hosts .",
    "since grb 971214 is the only grb with an observed redshift @xmath25 , this deserves special mention .",
    "if the luminosity distance for high - z grbs is more accurately described by the empty - beam case , then the quoted energy of grb971214 could be higher by a factor @xmath2 ( @xmath26 ) , implying an energy output of some @xmath27 ergs .",
    "if the energy is isotropic , the released energy is too high for most models , including the neutron star merger models . this would indicate that the grb emission may be strongly beamed , which would be a natural consequence of relativistic expansion , or may require a neutron star - massive black hole merger model , or a hypernova model for the grb .",
    "furthermore , grb host galaxies to the fainter side of the expected magnitude distribution could easily be explained by such a variation in the luminosity distance .",
    "detailed studies of cosmological lensing indicate that the most probable effect is a milder demagnification of high - z sources than these extreme values , with a probability tail of positive magnification leading up to strong lensing events . given the extreme nature of grbs however , where the observed energies are already too large compared to the predictions from many models , the possibility that we are systematically underestimating the intrinsic energy release is perhaps the more relevant issue .",
    "filled beam estimates of intrinsic luminosity should therefore be considered subject to an unknown amount of scatter , tending towards underestimates of the true value by as much as the factors presented here ."
