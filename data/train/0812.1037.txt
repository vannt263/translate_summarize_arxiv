    "experiments will soon measure correlations in the peculiar velocity field traced by massive galaxy clusters .",
    "the linear theory description of these correlations as traced by dark matter particles whose motions are driven by gravitational instability from an initially gaussian random field , has been available for about 20 years ( gorski 1988 ) .",
    "the extension of this formalism to biased tracers , within the framework of perturbation theory , is in fisher ( 1995 ) ; sheth et al . ( 2001b ) derive similar results within the context of the halo model ( see cooray & sheth 2002 for a review ) ; and regs & szalay ( 1996 ) study this problem in the context of peaks ( see desjacques 2008 for corrections to their expressions ) .",
    "all these analyses yield consistent results .",
    "however , measurements of the velocity correlations of massive haloes in simulations have given the impression that , although biased linear theory provides a reasonable description of the correlations between the velocity components that are perpendicular to the line of separation @xmath0 , it is wildly discrepant for the components which are parallel to the line of separation @xmath1 ( croft & efstathiou 1994 ; peel 2006 ) , except on scales larger than about 100 mpc .",
    "this discrepancy has been attributed to nonlinear effects , such as those described by colberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and sheth & diaferio ( 2001 ) .",
    "the main purpose of this short note is to show that , in fact , linear theory does indeed provide a good description of @xmath1 , provided one accounts for the fact that the measurement is actually pair weighted , and so the mean streaming motions may not be negligible . for dark matter",
    ", this mean is sufficiently small that it can be ignored , but ignoring the mean streaming of massive halos towards one another is a very bad approximation .",
    "we show that keeping this term in the theoretical calculation provides substantially better agreement with the measurements .",
    "section  [ theory ] provides the linear theory expressions for the velocity statistics of interest , section  [ measurement ] presents a comparison of these expressions with simulations , and a final section summarizes our results .",
    "an appendix provides some technical details of the calculation .",
    "in linear theory for dark matter , the mean approach velocity of particle pairs along the line of separation is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hubble constant , @xmath4 for flat @xmath5cdm models , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the linear theory power spectrum of the density fluctuation field .",
    "this is often called the streaming motion ; the term @xmath8 in the denominator reflects the fact that the average is over all pairs with separation @xmath9 . for what is to follow",
    ", it will be convenient to write this as @xmath10 , to emphasize the fact that the motion is parallel to the separation vector . in linear theory , the mean motion",
    "perpendicular to the line of separation is zero : @xmath11 .",
    "dark matter halos are biased tracers of the underlying density field . if this bias is linear , but the velocities are unbiased , then @xmath12\\,\\langle v_{||}(r)\\rangle      = b\\ , v_{12}^{\\rm dm}(r)\\,[1+\\xi(r)],\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the linear bias factor ( see appendix ) .",
    "the linear theory velocity dispersion is @xmath14 where the smoothing window is related to halo mass by setting @xmath15 with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the comoving number density .",
    "the factor of 3 makes this a one - dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "the presence of @xmath18 makes the velocity dispersion decrease slightly with increasing halo mass ( sheth & diaferio 2001 ) .",
    "note that there is no additional dependence on halo bias factor .",
    "the two - point velocity correlation tensor is @xmath19 \\,\\hat{{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}}}_i \\hat{{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}}}_j,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the radial and transverse correlation functions ( monin & yaglom 1975 ) . in linear theory ,",
    "the velocity field is potential , so @xmath24 ( e.g. gorski 1988 ) . for gaussian initial conditions ,",
    "the linear theory correlation between velocity components perpendicular to the line of separation is @xmath25 whereas the linear theory correlation between velocity components parallel to the line of separation is @xmath26\\over 4}.   \\label{psill}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a number of previous analyses have ignored the final term in this expression .",
    "the appendix shows why , if the velocity correlations are estimated using pairs of tracer particles ( as is commonly done ) , it should be included .",
    "we compare the expressions above with measurements made in the hubble volume simulation ( evrard et al .",
    "the background cosmology for this simulation is flat @xmath5cdm with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29  km  s@xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "we present results for halos within a very narrow mass bins centered on @xmath32 and 15 .",
    "there were 28956 , 21461 , and 9352 haloes in each bin .     and 15 ( bottom to top ) .",
    "smooth curves show the linear bias prediction , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and 3 . ]    the measured one - dimensional velocity dispersions of the halos are @xmath35 313 , 303 and 283  km  s@xmath30 , whereas the values predicted by equation  ( [ sigmav ] ) are slightly smaller : 289 , 276 and 258  km  s@xmath30 .",
    "this may be an indication that nonlinear effects of the sort discussed by colberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and sheth & diaferio ( 2001 ) have affected halo velocities . if we were to set @xmath36 in equation  ( [ sigmav ] ) as a crude way of accounting for nonlinear evolution , then this would make @xmath37  km  s@xmath30 .",
    "figure  [ v12plot ] shows the mean streaming motions of massive halos along the line of separation .",
    "notice that these velocities can be large : the important point in the present context is that , on small scales , @xmath38 .",
    "the smooth curves show @xmath39 $ ] of equation  ( [ v12 ] ) , multiplied by bias factors of @xmath34 and 3 .",
    "they provide a reasonably accurate description of the measurements",
    ". one might have thought that a more appropriate model would not multiply by @xmath8 , and would include a factor of @xmath40 in the integral of equation  ( [ v12 ] ) , for the same reason that it is included in the expressions for @xmath41 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that including such smoothing produces too little streaming ( compared to the simulations ) on small scales . if the larger streaming on small scales is a consequence of nonlinear effects ,",
    "then it may be that removing the smoothing term is a convenient way to approximately account for nonlinear evolution .",
    "( e.g. , setting @xmath36 in equation  [ sigmav ] brings @xmath41 into slightly better agreement with the measurements . )",
    "multiplying by @xmath8 serves a similar purpose .",
    "figure  [ xivkms ] compares the predicted velocity correlations for these halos ( curves ) with the measurements ( symbols ) .",
    "the solid curves show the predictions of equations  ( [ psiperp ] ) and  ( [ psill ] ) .",
    "the dashed curves in the panels on the left show the result of ignoring the final term in equation  ( [ psill ] ) ; notice how the dashed curves grossly overestimate the measured signal ( filled symbols ) .",
    "this is the apparent failure of linear theory noted by croft & eftathiou ( 1994 ) and peel ( 2006 ) .",
    "however , they are in good agreement with the measurements if , in the measurements , we add back the contribution from the mean streaming term ( open symbols ) .",
    "this , and the reasonable agreement between the solid curves and solid symbols , indicates that linear theory is , in fact , not so badly flawed .",
    "the mean streaming motions of massive halos can be as large as 1000  km  s@xmath30 on scales of order @xmath42  mpc .",
    "in contrast , the one dimensional velocity dispersions of these halos is of order 300  km  s@xmath30 .",
    "nevertheless , these motions are rather well described by biased linear theory .",
    "the fact that the mean streaming motions of halos can be substantially larger than the halo velocity dispersions has an important consequence : they must not be ignored when making the linear theory estimate of velocity correlations @xmath1 and @xmath0 for pair - weighted statistics . ignoring",
    "this contribution leads one to predict that @xmath1 is positive ; i.e. , objects stream along with one another , whatever their mass .",
    "the measurements show that while this is true for the lower mass halos ( they are still quite massive ! ) , @xmath1 is negative for the most massive halos .",
    "this means that the most massive halos move towards , rather than along with , one another ; this is consistent with linear theory provided one accounts for the fact that the measurements are pair - weighted , so one should not ignore the contribution of the mean streaming motions .",
    "we note that , although they do not say so explicitly , halo model analyses of halo motions ( sheth et al .",
    "2001a ) have correctly included the effects of this mean streaming .",
    "it is the appearance of more recent studies which ignore this effect ( e.g. we had communicated the importance of this term to peel 2006 , but his figures do not include it ) which prompted our work . because our analysis shows that linear theory can be used down to scales which are significantly smaller than previously thought , we hope that our analysis will aid in the interpretation of data from the next generation of surveys .    for deep surveys ,",
    "the gain in accuracy is likely to be modest .",
    "this is because sky surveys typically estimate the correlation between radially projected velocities , separated by some angle @xmath43 on the sky .",
    "this quantity is related to ours by @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , both are evaluated at scale @xmath47 , and @xmath48 this can also be written as @xmath49 showing that our extra term is most important for pairs which are close in angle but lie at different distances along the line of sight . for very deep surveys ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 greater than 100 mpc , say ) the observable is dominated by @xmath0 for all scales where the addition of our extra term is important .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that the term is present , and its inclusion greatly improves comparison with simulations , thus strengthening ones confidence in the validity of linear theory .",
    "although accounting for mean streaming motions results in substantially better agreement with the simulations , there remains room for improvement .",
    "our treatment of how @xmath52 should depend on halo mass on small scales is rather ad hoc .",
    "methods motivated by perturbation theory are beginning to provide more detailed prescriptions for this term ( e.g. smith et al . 2008 ) .",
    "also , in perturbation theory , the power spectrum of peculiar velocities is expected to be slightly suppressed relative to the linear theory prediction , even on relatively large scales ( e.g. bernardeau et al .",
    "2002 ; cooray & sheth 2002 ; pueblas & scoccimarro 2008 ) .",
    "although including this effect is beyond the scope of this work , we note that accounting for it will lower the theory curves slightly , reducing the small discrepancy in the panels on the right of figure  [ xivkms ] .",
    "incorporating these refinements into our analysis is the subject of work in progress .",

    "dark matter halos are biased tracers of the underlying density field . if this bias is linear , but the halo velocities are unbiased , then pair - weighted ( as opposed to volume weighted ) velocity statistics of halos may be biased relative to those of the mass , with the effect increasing with spatial bias .    to see this , it is helpful write the expressions in the main text explicitly as averages over pairs . in linear theory , the mean streaming motions are @xmath53 where @xmath54 and it is understood that @xmath55 .",
