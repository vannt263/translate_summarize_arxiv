    "one of the classical problems in queueing theory is to schedule the customers / jobs in a network in an optimal way .",
    "these problems are known as the scheduling problems which arise in a wide variety of applications , in particular , whenever there are different customer classes present in the network and competing for the same resources .",
    "the optimal scheduling problem has a long history in the literature .",
    "one of the appealing scheduling rules is the well - known  @xmath4 rule .",
    "this is a static priority policy in which it is assumed that each class-@xmath5 customer has a marginal delay cost @xmath6 and an average service time @xmath7 , and the classes are prioritized in the decreasing order of @xmath8 .",
    "this static priority rule has proven asymptotically optimal in many settings @xcite . in @xcite , a single - server markov modulated queueing network is considered and an _ averaged _",
    "@xmath4-rule is shown asymptotically optimal for the discounted control problem .",
    "an important aspect of queueing networks is abandonment / reneging , that is , customers / jobs may choose to leave the system while being in the queue before their service .",
    "therefore , it is important to include customer abandonment in modeling queueing systems . in @xcite , atar et al . considered a multi - class @xmath9 queueing network with customer abandonment and proved that a modified priority policy , referred to as @xmath10 rule , is asymptotically optimal for the long run average cost in the fluid scale .",
    "dai and tezcan @xcite showed the asymptotic optimality of a static priority policy on a finite time interval for a parallel server model under the assumed conditions on the ordering of the abandonment rates and running costs .",
    "although static priority policies are easy to implement , it may not be optimal for control problems of many multi - server queueing systems .",
    "for the same multi - class @xmath9 queueing network , discounted cost control problems are studied in @xcite , and asymptotically optimal controls for these problems are constructed from the minimizer of a hamilton  jacobi ",
    "bellman ( hjb ) equation associated with the controlled diffusions in the halfin  whitt regime .    in this article",
    ", we are interested in an ergodic control problem for a multi - class @xmath9 queueing network in the halfin  whitt regime .",
    "the network consists of a single pool of @xmath0 statistically identical servers and a buffer of infinite capacity .",
    "there are @xmath11 customer classes and arrivals of jobs / customers are @xmath11 independent poisson processes with parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the service rate for customers is @xmath14 , @xmath13 .",
    "customers may renege from the queue if they have not started to receive service before their patience times .",
    "class-@xmath5 customers renege from the queue at rates @xmath15 , @xmath13 .",
    "the scheduling policies are _ work - conserving _",
    ", that is , no server stays idle if any of the queues is nonempty .",
    "we assume the system operates in the halfin ",
    "whitt regime , where the arrival rates and the number of servers are scaled appropriately in a manner that the traffic intensity of the system satisfies @xmath16 in this regime , the system operations achieve both high quality ( high server levels ) and high efficiency ( high servers utilization ) , and hence it is also referred to as the quality - and - efficiency - driven ( qed ) regime ; see , for example , @xcite on the many - server regimes .",
    "we consider an ergodic cost function given by @xmath17,\\ ] ] where the _ running cost _",
    "@xmath18 is a nonnegative , convex function with polynomial growth and @xmath19 is the diffusion - scaled queue length process .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in addition to the running cost above which is based on the queue - length , we can add an idle - server cost provided that it has at most polynomial growth .",
    "for such , a running cost structure the same analysis goes through .",
    "the control is the allocation of servers to different classes of customers at the service completion times .",
    "the value function is defined to be the infimum of the above cost over all _ admissible _ controls ( among all work - conserving scheduling policies ) . in this article , we are interested in the existence and uniqueness of asymptotically optimal stable stationary markov controls for the ergodic control problem , and the asymptotic behavior of the value functions as @xmath0 tends to infinity . in @xcite ,",
    "section  5.2 , it is stated that analysis of this type of problems is important for modeling call centers .",
    "the usual methodology for studying these problems is to consider the associated continuum model , which is the controlled diffusion limit in a heavy - traffic regime , and to study the ergodic control problem for the controlled diffusion .",
    "ergodic control problems governed by controlled diffusions have been well studied in literature @xcite for models that fall in these two categories : ( a ) the running cost is _ near - monotone _ , which is defined by the requirement that its value outside a compact set exceeds the optimal average cost , thus penalizing unstable behavior ( see assumption  3.4.2 in @xcite for details ) , or ( b ) the controlled diffusion is uniformly stable , that is , every stationary markov control is stable and the collection of invariant probability measures corresponding to the stationary markov controls is tight .",
    "however , the ergodic control problem at hand does not fall under any of these frameworks .",
    "first , the running cost we consider here is not near - monotone because the total queue length can be @xmath20 when the total number of customers in the system are @xmath21 . on the other hand , it is not at all clear that the controlled diffusion is uniformly stable ( unless one imposes nontrivial hypotheses on the parameters ) , and this remains an open problem .",
    "one of our main contributions in this article is that we solve the ergodic control problem for a broad class of nondegenerate controlled diffusions , that in a certain way can be viewed as a mixture of the two categories mentioned above .",
    "as we show in section  [ s - ergodic ] , stability of the diffusion under any optimal stationary markov control occurs due to certain interplay between the drift and the running cost .",
    "the model studied in section  [ s - ergodic ] is far more general than the queueing problem described , and thus it is of separate interest for ergodic control .",
    "we present a comprehensive study of this broad class of ergodic control problems that includes existence of a solution to the ergodic hjb equation , its stochastic representation and verification of optimality ( theorem  [ t - hjb2 ] ) , uniqueness of the solution in a certain class ( theorem  [ t - unique ] ) , and convergence of the vanishing discount method ( theorem  [ t - hjb3 ] ) .",
    "these results extend the well - known results for near - monotone running costs . the assumptions in these theorems are verified for the multi - class queueing model and the corresponding characterization of optimality is obtained ( corollary  [ c - unique ] ) , which includes growth estimates for the solution of the hjb .",
    "we also introduce a new approximation technique , _ spatial truncation _",
    ", for the controlled diffusion processes ; see section  [ s - truncation ] . it is shown that if we freeze the markov controls to a fixed stable markov control outside a compact set , then we can still obtain nearly optimal controls in this class of markov controls for large compact sets .",
    "we should keep in mind that this property is not true in general .",
    "this method can also be thought of as an approximation by a class of controlled diffusions that are uniformly stable .",
    "we remark that for a fixed control , the controlled diffusions for the queueing model can be regarded as a special case of the piecewise linear diffusions considered in @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that these diffusions are stable under _ constant _ markov controls .",
    "the proof is via a suitable lyapunov function .",
    "we conjecture that uniform stability holds for the controlled diffusions associated with the queueing model . for the same multi - class markovian model , gamarnik and stolyar",
    "show that the stationary distributions of the queue lengths are tight under any work - conserving policy @xcite , theorem  2 .",
    "we also wish to remark here that we allow  @xmath3 to be negative , assuming abandonment rates are strictly positive , while in @xcite , @xmath22 and abandonment rates can be zero .",
    "another important contribution of this work is the convergence of the value functions associated with the sequence of multi - class queueing models to the value of the ergodic control problem , say @xmath23 , corresponding to the controlled diffusion model .",
    "it is not obvious that one can have asymptotic optimality from the existence of optimal stable controls for the hjb equations of controlled diffusions .",
    "this fact is relatively straightforward when the cost under consideration is discounted .",
    "in that situation , the tightness of paths on a finite time horizon is sufficient to prove asymptotic optimality @xcite .",
    "but we are in a situation where any finite time behavior of the stochastic process plays no role in the cost . in particular",
    ", we need to establish the convergence of the controlled steady states .",
    "although uniform stability of stationary distributions for this multi - class queueing model in the case where @xmath22 and abandonment rates can be zero is established in @xcite , it is not obvious that the stochastic model considered here has the property of uniform stability",
    ". therefore , we use a different method to establish the asymptotic optimality .",
    "first , we show that the value functions are asymptotically bounded below by @xmath23 . to study the upper bound , we construct a sequence of markov scheduling policies that are uniformly stable ( see lemma  [ lem - uni ] ) .",
    "the key idea used in establishing such stability results is a spatial truncation technique , under which the markov policies follow a fixed priority policy outside a given compact set .",
    "we believe these techniques can also be used to study ergodic control problems for other many - server queueing models .",
    "the scheduling policies we consider in this paper allow preemption , that is , a customer in service can be interrupted for the server to serve a customer of a different class and her service will be resumed later .",
    "in fact , the asymptotic optimality is shown within the class of the work - conserving preemptive policies . in @xcite ,",
    "both preemptive and nonpreemptive policies are studied , where a nonpreemptive scheduling control policy is constructed from the hjb equation associated with preemptive policies and thus is shown to be asymptotically optimal . however , as far as we know , the optimal nonpreemptive scheduling problem under the ergodic cost remains open .    for a similar line of work in uncontrolled settings ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "admission control of the single class @xmath9 model with an ergodic cost criterion in the halfin ",
    "whitt regime is studied in @xcite .",
    "for controlled problems and for finite server models , asymptotic optimality is obtained in @xcite in the conventional heavy - traffic regime .",
    "the main advantage in @xcite is the uniform exponential stability of the stochastic processes , which is obtained by using properties of the skorohod reflection map .",
    "a recent work studying ergodic control of a multi - class single - server queueing network is @xcite .    to summarize our main contributions in this paper :    * we introduce a new class of ergodic control problems and a framework to solve them .",
