    "in recent years , long term evolution ( lte ) standardized by the 3rd generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) has become one of the most popular cellular technologies in the world .",
    "the increasing use of smartphones and other wireless devices has caused an exponential increase in mobile broadband data usage , which results in the so - called _ spectrum scarcity _ problem .",
    "since the existing spectrum is not enough for lte system and available limited licensed spectrum can be costly to increase , implementing lte in unlicensed frequency bands is a promising way to solve the problem mentioned before .",
    "it is inevitable for lte to co - exist with other networks when it expands over to unlicensed spectrums .",
    "co - existence between heterogeneous systems has been studied before , for instance , ieee 802.15.4 and ieee 802.11b / g @xcite , lte and wlan @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the co - existence causes significant degradation on system performance . besides , interference coordination schemes have also been studied to increase spectral efficiency in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an effective approach to reduce the interference in underlay spectrum sharing networks with multiple users and antennas by transmitting antenna selection in decode - and - forward relaying is presented in @xcite .",
    "theoretical analysis of channel sharing methods is discussed in @xcite , and the authors perform stochastic performance analysis of a finite - state markov channel shared by multiple users .    several studies of lte co - existing with wlan in unlicensed frequency bands can be found in @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors realize the co - existence between lte and wlan by limiting lte presence in the shared band . similarly , in @xcite , a mechanism to enable co - existence between lte and wlan in 900 mhz is described .",
    "this mechanism utilizes a modified version of almost - blank subframes ( abs ) and improves the wlan system performance by allocating more subframes to it .",
    "however , simulation results show that only when lte gives up more than 80% of the subframes can wlan reach the optimum performance .",
    "otherwise , wlan degrades severely . in @xcite ,",
    "the concept of deploying lte in the license - exempt band is presented .",
    "also , some modifications needed to be made in lte systems : a listen - before - talk ( lbt ) scheme and rts / cts protocol .",
    "however , communication efficiency will decrease because lte listens to the channel before every transmission .",
    "it is necessary to enable lte co - exist with wlan and not to degrade their performances .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate an adaptive mechanism for the co - existence of lte and wlan .",
    "lte does not occupy all the subframes in this mechanism but spares subframes to wlan system dynamically .",
    "in other words , lte adjusts its subframe configuration periodically regarding the traffic load of wlan system .",
    "therefore , the two systems both can deliver significant capacity during the co - existence .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section ,",
    "the adaptive co - existence methodology is discussed . in section , the co - existence mechanism of lte and wlan system in unlicensed frequency bands",
    "is presented .",
    "section presents the simulation scenarios and results .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section .",
    "before discussing the adaptive co - existence methodology , we should notice that lte differs greatly from wlan in terms of allocating bandwidth resources when transmitting data on physical medium .",
    "the main difference between lte and wlan system is that lte just reduces its transmission speed while wlan holds its transmission in the case of channel interference .",
    "wlan is a contention based system and is based on carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance ( csma / ca ) , that is , terminals and access points ( ap ) contend together for the same band .",
    ".subframe configuration examples of lte system . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from table [ table:3 ] , if we guarantee that the throughput loss of wlan system is less than 15% in co - existence , lte can only work in mode 4 and adaptive co - existence mechanism . from table",
    "[ table:3 ] we can see that in mode 4 , wlan performance is a little better than that of adaptive co - existence mechanism . however , from table [ table:4 ] , it is obvious that lte with adaptive co - existence mechanism performs much better than that in mode 4 .",
    "this is because lte allocates less than 8 subframes to wlan system during most of the simulation time in adaptive co - existence mechanism .",
    "the number of mute subframes is adjusted adaptively . on the other hand",
    ", lte always gives 8 subframes to wlan system in mode 4 , which leads to higher performance of wlan system while the performance of lte system degrades a lot .",
    "the combined throughput of lte and wlan in these mechanisms are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "[ fig:7 ] shows that the adaptive co - existence mechanism outperforms mode 4 in terms of combined average throughput of lte and wlan . in simulations ,",
    "wlan traffic load increases linearly while in reality , it will change randomly , which indicates that the combined performance of lte and wlan may be better than other mechanisms when the average throughput of wlan is expected to lose 15% at most . from the simulation results we have presented",
    ", the adaptive co - existence mechanism will bring much better performance to wlan .",
    "in this paper , an adaptive co - existence mechanism of lte co - existing with wlan in the same unlicensed band is proposed .",
    "its performance is verified to outperform the existing ones .",
    "if lte works in a fixed subframe configuration mode , the throughput of wlan will increase gradually while that of lte will decrease at the same time . from simulations , we have found that the adaptive co - existence mechanism guarantees a significant performance of wlan system which only loses about 10% compared to the wlan optimum performance .",
    "collections of lte and wlan average throughput and number of mute subframes every reallocation cycle in simulations prove that lte can track wlan traffic load and modify its subframe configurations correspondingly . as a result",
    ", the adaptive co - existence mechanism brings a better combined throughput when wlan loses no more than 15% average throughput .",
    "future research is needed to find more sophisticated co - existence mechanisms that can ensure higher lte performance when it co - exists with wlan while wlan system performance is also significant .",
