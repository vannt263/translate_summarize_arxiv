    "<S> we study the convergence of the eigenvalue problems resulting from the displacement rayleigh quotient , the stress rayleigh quotient and the mixed quotient . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence rates of the three quotients are found to be related to the continuity and differentiability of the density and compliance variation over the unit cell . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the mixed quotient converges faster than both the displacement rayleigh and the stress rayleigh quotients , however , there exist special cases where either the displacement rayleigh or the stress rayleigh quotient shows the exact same convergence as the mixed - method . </S>",
    "<S> we show that all methods converge faster for smoother material property variations , but when density variation is rough , the difference between the mixed quotient and stress rayleigh quotient is higher and similarly , when compliance variation is rough , the difference between the mixed quotient and displacement rayleigh quotient is higher . since eigenvalue problems such as those considered in this paper tend to be highly computationally intensive , it is expected that these results will lead to fast and efficient algorithms in the areas of phononics and photonics .    </S>",
