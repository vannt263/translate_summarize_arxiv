    "the calculated conductance almost systematically deviates from the value expected for pristine graphene by up to one spin - degenerated conduction channel [ fig .",
    "6(a ) ] , for weak disorder ( @xmath118 ) , significantly larger than what is experimentally observed . the deviation is higher for electrons than for holes , where the asymmetry results from the sublattice symmetry breaking caused by the line defect . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "6(c ) , the deviation of the conductance from the case of pristine graphene is caused by a circulating current along the line defect .",
    "an analysis of the energy spectrum shows that counter - propagating states on either side of the line defect can hybridize and form non - chiral quasi-1d extended states @xcite able to carry current , which crosslink the opposite sample edges . acting as a direct short - circuit , such states are responsible for a strong carrier backscattering .",
    "remarkably , higher anderson disorder reinforces wave - function localization along the line defect and reduces the circulation of current ( fig .",
    "6(d ) ) , which finally improves the hall conductance quantization .",
    "it is also found that , due to the disorder , the deviation of the hall conductance from pristine quantization reduces with increasing magnetic field and sample width ( i.e. the length of the line defect network ) , both of which enhance the localization .",
    "see appendix b for additional details .",
    "thus , a moderate alteration of the hall conductance quantization comparable to what is experimentally observed can be reproduced .",
    "moreover , even though the simulations were run at 0 k , the existence of extended or poorly localized states along the line defect suggests smooth temperature behavior .",
    "localization by strong disorder along the line defect also leads to the possible observation of vrh or thermal activation behavior , characteristic of an anderson insulator .",
    "this is in sound agreement with our experimental observations , since , following the proposed scenario , @xmath65 measured at @xmath54 values corresponding to minima should be dominated by the conductance along the line defects , which is much higher than the bulk conductance inside the grains .",
    "finally , calculations performed for scrolled graphene @xcite indicate that wrinkles are also expected to alter the hall conductance quantization in a similar fashion .",
    "recent experimental results also suggest such an impact @xcite .",
    "to conclude , in polycrystalline cvd graphene characterized by a high density of line defects such as gbs and wrinkles , we highlight an unusual highly dissipative electronic transport in the qhe regime , which reveals the existence of poorly localized states between lls and manifests itself as a deviation of @xmath22 from the pristine quantization .",
    "numerical simulations confirm that such states can exist along a line defect crossing a hall bar and yielding strong backscattering between edge states .",
    "the impact of line effects turn out to be similar to that of crossing bilayer stripes in graphene grown by sublimation of silicon from silicon carbide@xcite",
    ". further theoretical work , possibly considering coulomb interactions and luttinger physics @xcite , is required to explain the observed temperature , magnetic field and current dependence of @xmath65 .",
    "our work also motivates the investigation of the qhe in cvd graphene monocrystals , whose size is continuously in progress @xcite , not only to discern the respective roles of gbs and wrinkles but also to progress towards an operational graphene - based quantum resistance standard .",

    "8(b , c ) , the states of the line defect are not localized enough to avoid transmission along the section of the ribbon , thus allowing for backscattering .",
    "as mentioned above , a wider ribbon width , i.e. a longer line defect length , would suppress electronic transmission from edge to edge and impede backscattering , thus restoring the conductance quantization as for @xmath130100 mev .",
    "note that the full scale in fig .",
    "8(a - c ) has been reduced to allow for the observation of the edge channels and the states around the line defect .",
    "however , a higher full scale highlights the presence of very localized states exactly on the atoms of the defect .        as indicated in the main text , we considered the joint effect of anderson disorder along the line defect ( with strength @xmath133 ev ) and varying magnetic field ( up to 120 t ) .",
    "the results are reported in fig .",
    "9 , where we scaled the energy as @xmath134 in order to have the same position of the lls for different fields and facilitate the comparison between different configurations .",
    "the quality of the quantization increases with the magnetic field ( especially at weak fields ) .",
    "this may be related to the fact that at higher magnetic field the magnetic length is shorter and then the states along the line defect are more confined in the region where disorder is , thus making them more sensitive to it . at high disorder strength and high magnetic field , very little backscattering",
    "is observed .",
    "in high magnetic field , extended states form along the line defect , which results in crosslinking opposite ribbon edge states .",
    "this can be qualitatively pictured by making a fictitious cut of the ribbon along the defect to obtain two uncoupled regions , where chiral edge states are generated for energy in between lls , see fig .",
    "note that , in the region of the cut , the current flows in opposite direction in the two uncoupled ribbon parts ( green and magenta arrows ) .",
    "when we join these two parts along the line defect , the counterpropagating edge states become spatially close the one another , see fig .",
    "at this point , there are two possibilities , which depend both on the electron energy and the specific ribbon edge @xcite .",
    "we may have a gap along the weld joint , as , for example , in a perfect ribbon without any line defect . in this case , the counterpropagating edge channels cancel out , thus being unable to crosslink the ribbon edge channels .",
    "this is observed in fig .",
    "6(a ) of the main paper at energies @xmath135 mev , where the conductance is perfectly quantized .",
    "the second possibility is that the counterpropagating states survive and hybridize , thus giving rise to nonchiral edge states .",
    "this implies that electrons can flow in both directions .",
    "the level of spatial superposition of the channels determines the degree of their hybridization . for low hybridization degree ,",
    "a residual chirality is expected , in the sense that electrons moving from the top edge to the bottom edge will be more concentrated at one side of the line defect , while electrons moving from the bottom edge to the top edge will be mainly located at the other side .",
    "however , due to the spatial proximity between the channels , a weak disorder is likely to induce a significant scattering between them . indeed , as shown in the main paper , disorder is even able to localize these states , thus suppressing their extended nature .",

    "<S> we report on the observation of strong backscattering of charge carriers in the quantum hall regime of polycrystalline graphene , grown by chemical vapor deposition , which alters the accuracy of the hall resistance quantization . </S>",

    "<S> such states could be caused by the high density of line defects ( grain boundaries and wrinkles ) that cross the hall bars , as revealed by structural characterizations . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations confirm that quasi-1d extended non - chiral states can form along such line defects and short - circuit the hall bar chiral edge states . </S>"
