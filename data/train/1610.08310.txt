    "then , using eq .",
    "( [ undeformedboost ] ) to transform @xmath92 , we deduce that @xmath117 this defines a lorentz boost on @xmath118 as a map @xmath119 .",
    "once the form of the boosts is obtained , one can find the relativistic relations between different observers in spacetime . in the low rapidity limit @xmath120 the galileo transformations characterize the relations between energies of two boosted observers .",
    "furthermore special relativity also defines the time dilatation and length contraction effects seen by a stationary observer while looking at phenomena characterized by high velocities ( i.e. @xmath121 ) .",
    "however in any case ( and in any limit ) even if two boosted observers measure different energies , momenta , time - intervals and lengths , the relativity principle imposes that if some physical phenomenon , e.g. the decay of a particle , takes place in some reference frame , spacetime transformations should always allow all the observers to agree on the fact that such a decay happened .",
    "one consequence of this principle is that interaction vertices should be conserved by boost transformations .",
    "for instance , in the decay of a particle with momentum @xmath118 in two particles with momenta @xmath122 and @xmath123 , we expect to have @xmath124 , where @xmath118 , @xmath123 and @xmath122 are transformed according to  ( [ transformationofpsmall ] ) .",
    "however , taking into account that our deformed addition of momenta @xmath85 can be nonlinear , generally @xmath125 to obtain equality , we need to make explicit the lorentz group element implicit in the expression above .",

    "in other words , as observed first in  @xcite , while special relativity is implicitly assuming that the three momenta @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath135 all transform with the same lorentz group element @xmath130 , the nonlinearity of the momentum composition law may impose more complicated relations , in which each momentum transforms with a different lorentz group element . in @xcite",
    "the particular case of @xmath18-poincar was studied , and the findings of  @xcite were that there is a ` backreaction ' effect of momenta on lorentz transformations , which , for infinitesimal transformations , can be interpreted as an action of momenta on rapidity .",
    "the equations above impose a series of constraints on the functions @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 . in  @xcite",
    "these constraints were calculated in a perturbative setting ( at first order in @xmath10 and assuming undeformed rotational simmetry ) .",
    "the constraints found were enough to completely fix @xmath136 and @xmath137 , and to establish a few relationships between the parameters of @xmath138 and @xmath139 . as functions of the parameters of @xmath138 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 . ] in order to effectively calculate the backreaction effect acting on different interacting particles , we can formalize this feature as the `` right action '' of particles momenta on @xmath140 s rapidity parameters @xmath141 .",
