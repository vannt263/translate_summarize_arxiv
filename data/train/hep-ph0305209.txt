    "recently the babar collaboration announced the discovery of a @xmath3 positive parity meson at @xmath4  mev and a width smaller than 10  mev in the @xmath5 channel  @xcite .",
    "no spin assignment has been made as yet but in view of the low mass @xmath6 appears likely .",
    "for simplicity we shall refer to it as the scalar or the @xmath7 @xmath0 meson .",
    "this state was subsequently confirmed by the cleo collaboration  @xcite .",
    "cleo also reports the observation of another state near 2460 mev in the @xmath8 channel which is consistent with having @xmath9 .",
    "these discoveries triggered a series of articles with different claims . in this note",
    "we discuss the scalar state in view of recent lattice results , after briefly summarising the different interpretations .",
    "if one treats the charm quark as a heavy spectator , the spin and angular momentum of the light antiquark can either couple to @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) or to @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) . the interaction with the spectator spin will then result in a pseudoscalar - vector mass splitting for @xmath10 , in @xmath7 and @xmath15 states for @xmath13 and in @xmath16 and @xmath17 states for @xmath12 .",
    "the two @xmath15 states can undergo mixing .",
    "the pseudoscalar and vector @xmath0 states have been identified as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . then there is a @xmath20 state and a @xmath21 which",
    ", with the likely spin assignment @xmath22 in the latter case , form the @xmath23 doublet .",
    "the @xmath13 states can strongly decay into @xmath24 and @xmath25 and are expected to be broad resonances .",
    "the new @xmath1 and the state at 2.46  gev might constitute the missing doublet , where at least the former state , which lies almost 40 mev below the @xmath24 threshold , is narrow .",
    "cahn and jackson  @xcite interpret experiment in this way , in the context of a potential model .",
    "barnes and collaborators  @xcite in contrast argue that this state is most likely a @xmath24 molecule since its mass is 160  mev lighter than other potential model predictions which result in a mass around 2.48 gev  @xcite for the scalar @xmath26-wave @xmath0 .",
    "their argument is supported by the proximity to the @xmath24 threshold and they interpret this system as a generalisation of an @xmath27 @xmath28 molecule .",
    "a four - quark interpretation is also shared by cheng and hou  @xcite .",
    "szczepaniak  @xcite argues in favour of a strong @xmath29 atomic contribution .",
    "van beveren and rupp  @xcite also liken this state with the @xmath27 but interpret it as a quark model state .",
    "in their view the @xmath30 states are part of a low lying scalar quark - antiquark nonet , together with a @xmath31 and a @xmath32 .",
    "consequently , they postulate additional scalar @xmath33 mesons . according to them , in both the @xmath30 and the new @xmath34 systems , due to mixing with the @xmath35 or the @xmath24 continuum , respectively",
    ", the lowest scalar nonet is artificially lowered with respect to the quark model expectation .",
    "bardeen et al .",
    "@xcite discuss the heavy quark limit .",
    "they then follow refs .",
    "@xcite and interpret the @xmath36 ",
    "@xmath7 splitting in terms of chiral symmetry .",
    "the symmetry breaking scale corresponds in leading order to the constituent quark mass in the chiral limit  @xcite and has been estimated to be  @xcite @xmath37  mev , a value that is very close to the experimental splitting of @xmath38  mev .",
    "chiral loops however will somewhat reduce the former expectation  @xcite .",
    "colangelo et al .",
    "@xcite share this picture and godfrey  @xcite investigates the decays that one would expect in the case of a quark - antiquark interpretation .",
    "one should note that the vector - scalar splitting , which vanishes in the heavy quark limit , is as large as 143  mev in the @xmath0 system , indeed an @xmath39 correction to @xmath40 . in view of this",
    ", we would not expect the static approximation to be quantitatively correct for @xmath33 systems .",
    "we also remark that the @xmath7 can be interpreted as a chiral partner of the @xmath36 , independent of the quark model content , as long as isospin and strangeness agree .",
    "unfortunately , most predicted decay rates in many of the above pictures seem to be more dictated by the mass and quantum numbers of the state than by its quark content .",
    "however , in the case of an interpretation as a molecule or as part of an additional low lying scalar nonet ( or triplet ) , an extra quark - model scalar state should still exist above the @xmath24 threshold",
    ". however , this might turn out to be a rather broad resonance  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in a straight @xmath0 interpretation there is no room for extra states other than the @xmath41 and @xmath42 between a @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ? ) and the newly discovered @xmath1 ( @xmath6 ? ) .",
    "the chiral heavy quark interpretation results in similar predictions for @xmath43 systems  @xcite , which in principle can be checked experimentally .",
    "we will confront the new scalar state with lattice results in the static limit in the quenched approximation and for @xmath44 , before discussing finite charm quark mass corrections .    in the static limit",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath23 doublets will be exactly mass degenerate .",
    "we wish to calculate the @xmath46 and @xmath47 masses .",
    "these can be extracted from the asymptotic large @xmath48 decay of the two euclidean correlation functions , @xmath49 respectively .",
    "we made use of the relation @xmath50 for the wilson - dirac operator @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 denotes the wilson - schwinger line , connecting the point @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the spatial coordinate @xmath56 is suppressed in @xmath57 as well as in @xmath51 and the colour trace is implicit .     the @xmath47  @xmath46 splitting in the static limit , as a function of the light quark mass @xmath58 .",
    "open symbols denote inter- and extrapolations to physical up / down and strange quark masses .",
    "circles denote the @xmath44 case while squares denote the quenched approximation .",
    "the horizontal lines are the experimental values for the @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath18 splittings and the @xmath24 threshold.,width=317 ]    this static - light splitting has been calculated in the quenched approximation by michael and peisa  @xcite with wilson action at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the results are in agreement with earlier references  @xcite at additional lattice spacings and no significant lattice spacing dependence has been observed : the fine structure splittings , that strongly depend on short distance physics  @xcite , vanish by definition .",
    "the quenched results , extrapolated to up / down and strange quark masses are depicted in figure  [ figure ] ( open squares ) where @xmath61  mev .",
    "the results are @xmath62  mev and @xmath63 mev , respectively .",
    "the splittings of the @xmath46 states with respect to the @xmath64 states are 434(5 )  mev and 323(131 ) mev for strange and up / down quarks , roughly 50  mev larger .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath20 is 120  mev heavier than the scalar @xmath0 .",
    ".[table ] the static @xmath47  @xmath46 mass splittings @xmath40 for @xmath44 sea quarks  @xcite for different hopping parameters @xmath65 at @xmath66 .",
    "the numbers in the last column are subject to an additional 5  % overall scale uncertainty . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that while the nrqcd results for the @xmath43 systems agree with the respective @xmath67 static limits , the splitting is enhanced in the @xmath33 system , in agreement with the fully relativistic calculation .",
    "the relativistic @xmath0 splitting is bigger by as much as @xmath68  % with respect to the static limit . if we assume a similar increase for the case with sea quarks we would expect a splitting of 600(110 )  mev for the @xmath0 system , yielding the prediction @xmath69  gev .",
    "the potential model of ref .",
    "@xcite predicts 2.48  gev , while the quenched results are 2.44(5 )  gev ( nrqcd ) and 2.47(3 )  gev ( relativistic @xmath33 quark ) , all significantly bigger than the candidate s mass of 2.32  gev .",
    "the quenched lattice results for the @xmath0 system also indicate a tiny @xmath16  @xmath15 splitting , suggesting that the @xmath15 state should be heavier than 2.46  gev .",
    "we calculate a scalar - pseudoscalar splitting of @xmath70  mev in the static limit for @xmath44 sea quarks , significantly larger than the value 338  mev suggested by a heavy quark constituent quark model  @xcite and larger than the quenched qcd value @xmath71  mev .",
    "we also report a significant finite charm mass correction that casts doubt onto nave generalisations to the @xmath43 system .",
    "lattice predictions on the masses are consistent with the quark model of ref .",
    "@xcite and incompatible with the new state observed by babar and cleo .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath1 might receive a large @xmath24 component : the physics of this heavy scalar might indeed resemble elements of that governing the @xmath72 system .",
    "if this is the case then the masses of the up and down quarks will play a major rle and simulations with non - mass - degenerate sea quarks are required .    unfortunately , on the lattice the possibility of four - quark states has so far only been addressed in the static limit where attraction was reported in some channels  @xcite . in view of the new experimental candidate quenched simulations of relativistic four quark molecules are urgent . to understand the exact nature of the new state not only the spectrum but also predictions of decay rates are required . while lattice calculations of strong decays are unfeasible , a study of electro - magnetic decay rates is a possibility . +",
    "* notes added in proof * + the discovery of the two @xmath0 mesons has also been confirmed by the belle collaboration  @xcite .    a new lattice study of @xmath0 mesons by the ukqcd collaboration has appeared recently  @xcite and a paper by terasaki  @xcite on the new @xmath0 mesons was submitted to the preprint server only one day after this article .    in view of the possibility of similar states in the @xmath73 spectrum",
    "it appears worthwhile to mention that the static @xmath44 lattice results presented here imply that the scalar quark model @xmath73 meson should have a mass of 5837(43)(24 ) mev , with additional @xmath74 corrections of order 40  mev , possibly upwards , based on the @xmath0 experience .",
    "this has to be compared with the @xmath75 threshold of about 5775 mev .",
    "this work has been supported by the eu network hprn - ct-2000 - 00145 , a pparc advanced fellowship ( grant ppa / a / s/2000/00271 ) and pparc grants ppa / g / o/2000/00454 , ppa / g / o/2002/00463 .",
