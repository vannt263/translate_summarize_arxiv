    "still , the fact that it is possible to conduct searches for x - ray absorption lines in the hot igm is promising . to form a large enough database to make firmer statements about the baryonic contribution of gas hotter than that contained in the ovi absorption systems will likely require spectrographs on x - ray telescopes with very large effective areas , such as constellation - x .",

    "( 2003 ) have recently reported the detection of strong ovii absorption toward the low mass x - ray binary 4u1820 - 303 in ngc6624 , which is at odds with this prediction since 4u1820 - 303 is only @xmath77 kpc from the galactic plane",
    ". however , futamoto et al . (",

    "additional observations of this type would be valuable for determining the distribution of hot gas near the plane of the galaxy .",
    "investigators working in this field should report significant non - detections whenever possible .",
    "given the probability that several regions contribute to the observed absorption , it is dangerous to assume that the x - ray bearing gas is uniform , at a single temperature , or confined to one type of region .",
    "the same holds true for the lower temperature ovi gas , which is known to have a patchy spatial distribution and line profiles that contain multiple components ( see savage et al .",
    "2003 ; sembach et al .",
    "2003 ; howk et al .",
    "an example of the pitfalls that can be encountered in analyses of the x - ray absorption is provided by the pks2155 - 304 sight line .",

    "( 2002 ) associated the x - ray absorption near @xmath78 along the pks2155 - 304 sight line with the high - velocity ovi absorption observed by sembach et al .",
    "they found that a relatively uniform , ultra - low density , single - phase plasma with a density @xmath79 @xmath48 and a size of roughly 3 mpc was able to explain the ovi - viii absorption , modulo some difficulties in reproducing the observed ne / o ratio in the hot gas . from this , they concluded that the x - ray bearing gas must be distributed throughout the local group .",
    "however , this conclusion rested strongly on the supposition that the high velocity ovi absorption and the x - ray absorption in this direction are uniquely related , with no other significant sources of ovi or ovii - viii inside or outside the galaxy .",
    "this conclusion fails to account for the complex distribution of gas along the sight line and the ample evidence that the ovi hvcs in this direction have kinematical signatures similar to lower ionization species whose presence is not consistent with gas at @xmath80k and @xmath81 @xmath48 [ see sembach et al .",

    "the ionization parameter in the proposed medium is far too high to explain the strengths of the low ionization lines observed at essentially the same velocities as the ovi hvcs .",
    "other types of inhomogeneities in the hot gas distribution may also be present , as they are needed to reconcile the observed ne / o ratio with a solar ratio of ne / o ( nicastro et al . 2002 ) .",
    "( the possibility of explaining the factor of 2 discrepancy between the observed ne / o ratio and the solar ratio by preferential incorporation of oxygen into dust grains seems dubious given the much higher cosmic abundance of oxygen ) .",
    "if one invokes inhomogeneities in the gas distribution to explain the lower ionization gas , then such regions must necessarily account for some , or perhaps even all , of the ovi . as a result , the ionization constraints used to deduce the existence of an ultra - low density medium break down , and the adoption of a uniform single temperature medium is cast in doubt",
    ".    the low ionization high velocity clouds toward pks2155 - 304 should have densities typical of those of clouds located near the galaxy ( i.e. , @xmath82 @xmath48 ) .",
    "an example of one such region is high velocity cloud complex  c , whose ionization conditions suggest that the cloud is interacting with gas in an extended galactic corona ( sembach et al .",
    "2003 ; fox et al . 2004 ; collins et al .",
    "interactions of this type are consistent with the wider distribution of high velocity ovi seen on the sky ( see  4 ) and provide a dynamic , non - equilibrium view of the gas ionization that is far more amenable to creating a range of ionization conditions than is possible in a static , ultra - low density medium having enormous cooling times .",
    "thus , while some of the highly ionized oxygen may be located in the local group , consideration of all of the available information indicates that an ultra - low density ( @xmath83 @xmath48 , @xmath84 ) local group medium is not a viable explanation for all of the x - ray and high velocity ovi absorption toward pks2155 - 304 .",
    "a low density ( but not too low density ) medium with @xmath85 @xmath48 is still a possible repository for much of the highly ionized gas , but is in all likelihood only part of a complex distribution of hot gas along this sight line .",

    "for example , ovi is present in the magellanic stream , which passes through the south galactic pole and extends up to @xmath109 , with positive velocities for @xmath110 and negative velocities for @xmath111 .",
    "ovi is present in high velocity cloud complex  c , which covers a large portion of the northern galactic sky between @xmath112 and @xmath113 and has velocities of roughly 100 to 170 kms@xmath11 .",
    "the h1821 + 643 sight line ( @xmath114 ) contains ovi absorption at the velocities of the outer arm ( @xmath115 kms@xmath11 ) as well as at more negative velocities .    in some directions ,",
    "high velocity ovi is observed with no corresponding high velocity hi 21 cm emission .",
    "for example , at @xmath116 there are many ovi hvcs with @xmath117 kms@xmath11 .",
    "some of these features are broad absorption wings extending from the lower velocity absorption produced by the galactic thick disk / halo .",
    "high velocity ovi features toward mrk478 ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 kms@xmath11 ) , ngc4670 ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 kms@xmath11 ) , and tons180 ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 kms@xmath11 ) stand out as having particularly unusual velocities compared to those of other ovi features in similar regions of the sky .",
    "they too lack counterparts in hi 21 cm emission . these features",
    "may be located outside the local group ( i.e. , in the igm ) .",
    "we are currently investigating the hi content of some of these clouds through their hi lyman - series absorption in the fuse data .",
    "the segregation of positive and negative velocities in figure  4 is striking , indicating that the clouds and the underlying ( rotating ) disk of the galaxy have very different kinematics .",
    "a similar velocity pattern is seen for high velocity hi 21 cm emission and has sometimes been used to argue for a local group location for the high velocity clouds ( see blitz et al .",
    "the kinematics of the high velocity ovi clouds are consistent with a distant location , but do not necessarily require an extended local group distribution as proposed by nicastro et al .",
    "the dispersion about the mean of the high velocity ovi centroids decreases when the velocities are converted from the local standard of rest ( lsr ) into the galactic standard of rest ( gsr ) and the local group standard of rest ( lgsr ) reference frames .",
    "while this reduction is expected if the ovi is associated with gas in a highly extended galactic corona or in the local group , it _ does not _ provide sufficient proof by itself of an extended extragalactic distribution for the high velocity gas because the correction to the lgsr reference frame requires proper knowledge of the total space velocities of the clouds .",
    "only one component of motion - the velocity toward the sun - is observed .",
    "additional information , such as the gas metallicity , ionization state , or parallax resulting from transverse motion across the line of sight , is needed to constrain whether the clouds are located near the galaxy or are farther away in the local group .",
    "the high velocity ovi features have logarithmic column densities ( @xmath63 ) of 13.06 to 14.59 , with an average of @xmath124 and a median of 13.97 ( see figure  5 , left panel ) .",
    "the average high velocity ovi column density is a factor of 2.7 times lower than the typical low velocity ovi column density found for the same sight lines through the thick disk / halo of the galaxy ( see savage et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the line widths of the high velocity ovi features range from @xmath12516 km  s@xmath11 to @xmath12581 km  s@xmath11 , with an average of @xmath126 km  s@xmath11 ( see figure  5 , right panel ) .",
    "the lowest values of b are close to the thermal width of 17.1 km  s@xmath11 expected for ovi at its peak ionization fraction temperature of @xmath127k in collisional ionization equilibrium ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "the higher values of b require additional non - thermal broadening mechanisms or gas temperatures significantly larger than @xmath17k .",
    "one possible explanation for some of the high velocity ovi is that transition temperature gas arises at the boundaries between cool / warm clouds of gas and a very hot ( @xmath128k ) galactic corona or local group medium .",
    "sources of the high velocity material might include infalling or tidally disturbed galaxies .",
    "a hot , highly extended ( @xmath129 kpc ) corona or local group medium might be left over from the formation of the milky way or local group , or may be the result of continuous accretion of smaller galaxies over time .",
    "evidence for a hot galactic corona or local group medium is given in  3 .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of clouds moving through a hot , low - density medium show that weak bow shocks develop on the leading edges of the clouds as the gas is compressed and heated ( quilis & moore 2001 ) .",
    "even if the clouds are not moving at supersonic speeds relative to the ambient medium , some viscous or turbulent stripping of the cooler gas likely occurs .",
    "an alternative explanation for the ovi observed at high velocities may be that the clouds and any associated hi fragments are simply condensations within large gas structures falling onto the galaxy .",
    "cosmological structure formation models predict large numbers of cooling fragments embedded in dark matter , and some of these structures should be observable in ovi absorption as the gas passes through the @xmath130k temperature regime ( dav et al .",
    ".      some of the high velocity ovi clouds may be extragalactic clouds , based on what we currently know about their ionization properties .",
    "however , claims that essentially _ all _ of the ovi hvcs are extragalactic entities associated with an extended local group filament based on kinematical arguments alone appear to be untenable . such arguments",
    "fail to consider the selection biases inherent in the ovi sample , the presence of neutral ( hi ) and lower ionization ( siiv , civ ) gas associated with some of the ovi hvcs , and the known `` nearby '' locations for at least two of the primary high velocity complexes in the sample  the magellanic stream is circumgalactic tidal debris , and complex  c is interacting with the galactic corona ( see fox et al .",
    "furthermore , the ovii x - ray absorption measures used to support an extragalactic location have not yet been convincingly tied to either the ovi hvcs or to a local group location .",
    "the ovii absorption may well have a significant galactic component in some directions ( see fang et al .",
    "the local group filament interpretation ( nicastro et al . 2003 ) may be suitable for some of the observed high velocity ovi features , but it clearly fails in other particular cases ( e.g. , the magellanic stream or the pks2155 - 304 hvcs  see  3 ) .",
    "it also does not reproduce some of the properties of the ensemble of high velocity ovi features in our sample .",
    "for example , the `` local supercluster filament '' model ( kravtsov , klypin , & hoffman 2002 ) predicts average ovi velocity centroids higher than those observed ( @xmath131 kms@xmath11  vs. @xmath132 kms@xmath11 ) and average ovi line widths higher than those observed ( fwhm @xmath133 kms@xmath11  vs. fwhm @xmath134 kms@xmath11 ) .",
    "additional absorption and emission - line observations of other ions at ultraviolet wavelengths , particularly civ and siiv , would provide valuable information about the physical conditions , ionization , and locations of the ovi clouds .",
    "the detection of hot gas locally and at low redshift has altered our perspective on the presence of highly ionized gas outside of galaxies and has led to refined estimates of the baryonic content of the present - day universe . clearly , there is much work yet to be done in determining the spatial distribution of the hot gas , its physical conditions , and its association with galaxies and the larger - scale gaseous structures from which galaxies form .",
    "a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution of the hot gas would be possible with ultra - sensitive maps of the diffuse ovi emission associated with the cosmic web .",
    "emission maps would enable estimates of the filling factor of the hot gas , and would set the context for ongoing absorption - line studies of the hot gas .",
    "experiments to produce ovi emission maps over large regions of the sky are well - suited to small and medium explorer - class missions and have been proposed to nasa .",
    "the hubble space telescope cosmic origins spectrograph , which is to be installed as part of the next hst servicing mission , will greatly enhance studies of ovi systems at redshifts @xmath135 by increasing the number of accessible background sources to use for the absorption - line measurements .",
    "larger redshift paths will be probed , and more sight lines will be examined .",
    "in addition , the high sensitivity of the spectrograph will permit the acquisition of very high signal - to - noise spectra for bright extragalactic sources .",
    "in the longer term , larger ( 6 - 20 m ) ultraviolet / optical telescopes in space will make it possible to select many closely spaced lines of sight for detailed spectroscopic and imaging investigations of galactic and intergalactic structures associated with the hot gas",
    ". a key scientific motivation for such investigations will be to determine feedback mechanisms operating on the hot gas and the degree to which these processes affect the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "i thank blair savage , bart wakker , philipp richter , and marilyn meade for their efforts in making the fuse ovi survey a reality .",
    "i acknowledge lively discussions about ovi absorption with todd tripp and mike shull .",
