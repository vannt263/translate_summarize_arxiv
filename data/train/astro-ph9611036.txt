    "the era is now underway when faint galaxy surveys include estimates of internal kinematics .",
    "rotation curves and line - widths are routinely measured on 3 - 4 m class telescopes to @xmath6 ( vogt _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 , franx 1993 , bershady 1995b , bender _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , rix _",
    "_ 1996 , simard & pritchet 1996 ) , and to @xmath5 with 10 m class telescopes ( vogt _ et al .",
    "_ 1996a , b ) .",
    "a pressing question is whether current kinematic surveys show evidence for rapid evolution in @xmath1 , or if internal velocity  luminosity relations can be used to construct standard candles for cosmological measurements ( kron 1986 , van der kruit & pickles 1988 ) .",
    "how @xmath1 changes with redshift , say as a function of total mass , will depend in part on the amount and composition of dark matter .",
    "a number of recent pilot surveys have attempted to construct tully - fisher ( tf ) relations at intermediate redshifts with a dismaying range of results as interpreted by departures from local tully - fisher relations .",
    "our survey of h@xmath0 rotation curves for blue , luminous galaxies reveals little evidence for evolution in @xmath1 to @xmath7 ( bershady 1995b , bershady , mihos , & koo 1997 ) .",
    "the left panel of figure 1 shows our sample closely matches the @xmath8-band tf relation of local calibrators ( pierce & tully 1992 ) assuming h@xmath3=75 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 .",
    "a similar agreement is found in @xmath10 and @xmath11-bands .",
    "a small offset is observed to increase systematically from @xmath12 ( negligible ) to @xmath8 ( @xmath13 + 0.3 mag ) .",
    "the trend is consistent with underestimates of disk inclination and hence under - corrections for internal reddening in our sample .",
    "better inclination estimates are in progress .",
    "0.9 in    -0.15 in    more relevant to the issue of evolution is an examination of differential departures from a fiducial tf relation vs. redshift ( right panel of figure 1 ) . our sample together with those extending to @xmath5 from the keck telescope ( vogt _ et al .",
    "_ 1996a , b ) show little evidence for dramatic changes in @xmath1 .",
    "it is clear that with these small samples , little can be determined about q@xmath3 .",
    "however , two other samples ( rix _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , using [ o  ii ] @xmath14 line - widths ; and simard & pritchet 1996 , using [ o  ii ] @xmath14 rotation curves ) find evidence for brightening of 1.5 - 2 mag by z=0.25 - 0.4 .",
    "why are there such differences between surveys spanning comparable redshifts ?",
    "the above surveys consist of samples selected to optimize telescope efficiency .",
    "our strategy ( see bershady 1995b ) was , in short , to select galaxies that were optically blue ( expected to have strong line emission ) , but luminous in the near - infrared ( expected to be large and have rapid rotation ) .",
    "( 1996 ) and simard & pritchet ( 1996 ) surveys relax the luminosity criteria but have ( different ) color or emission line - strength criteria .",
    "the samples of vogt _ et al . _",
    "( 1996a , b ) are selected on the basis of visual morphology from hst wfpc-2 images .",
    "for a variety of reasons , either the characteristic luminosity , rest - frame color , or redshifts of these four surveys are different ( figure 2 ) .",
    "_ s ( 1996 ) sample is @xmath131 mag lower in luminosity than the others ; simard & pritchet s ( 1996 ) sample is intermediate in redshift between ours and vogt _ et al . _",
    "s ( 1996a , b ) ; our sample is redder ( in the rest - frame ) than the other three .",
    "3.15 in    -0.15 in    selection based on luminosity , color , line - strength or morphology is not a problem for differential measurements with redshift as long as the selection is well - defined over all redshifts .",
    "what is difficult , however , is comparing samples selected with different criteria , particularly because internal velocity  luminosity relations may systematically vary with galaxy type ( e.g. rubin _ et al .",
    "alternatively , galaxies may evolve differently depending on mass or other physical attributes .",
    "it is critical to distinguish between the above two possibilities .",
    "most current samples , however , are either too small or probe too narrow a range of redshift to _ internally _ measure changes with redshift .",
    "1.0 in    -0.15 in    more troublesome are potential biases with redshift in the kinematic measurements themselves .",
    "for example , interpretation of spatially integrated line - widths suffers from the ambiguity of not knowing the spatial distribution of the line - emitting material . in the optical , a centrally concentrated star - burst compared to a blue , star - forming disk may have drastically different line - widths even though their gravitational potentials are similar .",
    "( 1996 ) have presented the most comprehensive attempt to treat this problem to date . to complicate matters ,",
    "it is likely that there are systematic differences between the spatial distribution of [ o  ii ] @xmath14 and h@xmath0 in galaxies .",
    "a comprehensive comparison of h@xmath0 and [ o  ii ] @xmath14 even within local galaxies is lacking .",
    "more subtle are the effects of spatial resolution on spatially resolved rotation curve measurements . for example , how does the apparent maximum rotation velocity change for identical galaxies observed at different distances but in the same seeing ? one expects such effects are small if the galaxies remain larger than the seeing disk ; still , this question must be answered in detail .",
    "careful examination of all of the above questions is critical because of the steep slope in the relation between line - width and luminosity .",
    "the future success of using the tf relation to study galaxy evolution and cosmology depends on two additional factors .",
    "first , samples must be assembled intelligently to make internally - consistent comparisons over substantial ranges of redshift .",
    "surveys must be large enough to construct template relations at different redshifts and account empirically for internal absorption , as is now becoming possible locally ( e.g. giovanelli _ et al .",
    "second , independent assessments of luminosity evolution must be available because deviations from the power - law tf relation are degenerate for changes in @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "one possibility is the tolman surface - brightness test , an example of which is illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "while assumptions must be made about evolution in size , the beauty of this test is that surface - brightness , like line - width , is curvature independent . for the most luminous galaxies from bershady _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) , figure  3 indicates there is little evidence for brightening in the @xmath17-band surface - brightness to @xmath18 .",
    "one reasonable interpretation is that the luminous mass has changed little in luminous galaxies over this look - back time .",
    "note that the sample in figure 3 is not the same as our ( rotation curve ) sample in figure 1 , but illustrates the concept .",
    "such studies _ in the field _ are easily extendible  using 10m - class telescopes or the hubble space telescope  to include tf samples at @xmath5 or lower luminosities .",
    "the near - infrared is advantageous because @xmath19-corrections are well - defined to high redshifts , vary little between galaxy types , and presumably trace stellar mass .",
    "global kinematic measurements , such as rotation curves , are a rather blunt tool for probing dark _ and _ luminous matter in galaxies because they are sensitive to the total mass . for spirals ,",
    "the @xmath1 of the disk is likely to vary much more rapidly with look - back time than the halo @xmath1 .",
    "yet the disk constitutes only a small portion of the total mass , while providing substantially to the total light .",
    "hence it would be desirable to independently measure the masses of the disk and halo .",
    "this is possible for spirals if rotation curve and disk scale length measurements are combined with measurements of the @xmath20-component of the disk velocity dispersion ( @xmath21 ) and scale height ( bahcall & casertano 1984 ) .",
    "direct determinations of disk and total masses would alleviate the assumptions in most disk / halo decompositions , namely maximal disks and constant disk @xmath1 ( e.g. van albada _",
    "_ 1985 , sackett 1995 ) .            how would such measurement be made ?",
    "an important issue to consider is disk inclination . in order to maximize projection ,",
    "face - on galaxies are preferable for measuring @xmath21 ( which is small ) , while more inclined systems are preferable for rotation in order to minimize corrections .",
    "disk scale height measurements must be made for highly inclined systems .",
    "one option is to survey similar galaxies with a range of disk inclinations .",
    "to separate @xmath21 from the other components of the disk velocity dispersion ellipsoid in inclined disks requires observations at multiple position angles .",
    "such observations will also provide sensitivity to ( i ) non - circular motions ( franx & de zeeuw 1992 ) ; ( ii ) the radial dispersion @xmath22 , which can be used to explore disk stability ( toomre 1964 ) ; and ( iii ) kinematic estimates of disk inclination ( e.g. van der kruit & allen 1978 ) .",
    "can such measurements be made ?",
    "disks generally have low surface brightness and velocity dispersions of few @xmath23 10 km / s , requiring spectral resolutions of @xmath138,000 - 10,000 .",
    "there have been a number of measurements of disk velocity dispersions in nearby galaxies ( e.g. recently bottema 1993 , and references therein ) , but they have proven difficult on 4m - class telescopes . however , integral field spectroscopy on 10m - class telescopes would make such measurements quite feasible .",
    "in addition to the increased light gathering power of a 10 m telescope , multiple position angles could be observed simultaneously .",
    "we are designing integral field units for the 9 m hobby - eberly telescope s ( het ) medium resolution spectrograph specifically for observing disk kinematics .",
    "one example of an integral fields unit for the het is illustrated in figure 4 . in two hours",
    "the het can measure a disk velocity dispersion at @xmath20=0.2 for what would take 6 hours at @xmath20=0 on a 4 m telescope .",
    "a simulation of a large spiral galaxy observed with an integral field unit at @xmath20=0.2 is shown in figure 5 .",
    "a second unit is designed for galaxies at redshifts as low as 0.05 .    even without disk scale height information for individual galaxies ,",
    "integral field spectroscopy will enable us to determine the ratio of rotation speed to disk velocity dispersion in a single observation per galaxy . to first order",
    ", this ratio scales as the ratio of the total mass to the mass of the disk .",
    "hence it should be possible to substantially improve our estimates of galaxy disk and halo masses .",
    "this in turn will allow us to better interpret observed changes in global @xmath1 at intermediate redshifts and the nature of dark matter .",
    "i thank c. mihos and d. koo for allowing me to present results of our rotation curve survey and simulations prior to publication .",
    "this research was supported in part by nasa through grant hf-1028.02 - 92a from stsci ( operated by aura , inc . under contract nas5 - 26555 ) ."
