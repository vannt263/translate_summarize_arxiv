    "the large radio lobes of radio galaxies both affect and are affected by their environment",
    ". they may be distorted by motion through an intracluster medium or by an encounter with interstellar matter in the host galaxy or a companion galaxy .",
    "in addition , impacts between jets and interstellar matter may trigger star formation . to investigate",
    "the interplay between radio lobes and the interstellar matter in radio galaxies , detailed studies of the interstellar matter in nearby radio galaxies are essential . in this paper",
    ", we present a study of the interstellar matter in the nearby low luminosity radio galaxy ngc 4410a .",
    "ngc 4410a is part of a small group containing a dozen known members .",
    "ngc 4410a has a prominent bulge surrounded by a ring - like or loop - like structure ( figure 1a ) .",
    "east and southeast of the nucleus , luminous h  ii regions are detected ( figure 1b ) .",
    "there is an hi tail extending to the southeast of the ngc 4410a+b pair , coincident with a stellar tail ( figure 2 ) .",
    "ngc 4410a was also detected in co ( 1 @xmath0 0 ) , yielding m@xmath1 @xmath2 4 @xmath3 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 .",
    "ngc 4410a has two distorted radio lobes ; the southeastern lobe is superposed on the optical / hi tidal tail .",
    "x - ray maps show a 2@xmath6 long ` tail ' coincident with the ngc 4410a+b / ngc 4410c stellar bridge .",
    "the ngc 4410 group shows clear evidence for gravitational interactions between galaxies as well as evidence for an external force acting upon the radio lobes .",
    "the peculiar ring - like structure of ngc 4410a suggests that a near - head - on collision with ngc 4410b has occurred .",
    "we suggest that the distortion of the radio lobes was caused by ram pressure from the interstellar medium , due to the motion of this gas relative to the radio source during a gravitational interaction between galaxies",
    ". the x - ray extension may be due to shocked tidal gas or intragroup gas coincidently superposed on the stellar bridge .",
    "the star formation may have been induced by the collision or by a jet / interstellar medium impact ."
