    "in the past few years , the community modeling heavy ion collisions has made tremendous progress incorporating viscous effects into hydrodynamic models . however , even viscous models are based on an assumption of short mean free paths and become invalid near the breakup stage when densities become low enough that particles can traverse a significant fraction of the reaction volume .",
    "fortunately , since these densities are low , the system can be treated as a hadronic gas undergoing binary collisions and boltzmann treatments are justified .",
    "this paper focuses on issues related to the interface between the two treatments . for transitions from ideal hydrodynamics ,",
    "the transition is treated by generating particles consistent with a thermal distribution as a source term for the boltzmann transport .",
    "here , we present and test a detailed prescription for consistently incorporating viscous effects into such an interface . we also address the question of whether bulk viscosity plays a role in a low density hadronic gas .    from a phenomenological point of view , an understanding of these issues is crucial before the viscosity of the so - called `` perfect fluid '' created in heavy ion collisions can be properly ascertained .",
    "most of the elliptic flow observed in the final state is generated in the earlier stages of the collision @xcite whic can be undestood with ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "however , there are substantial differences between ideal and viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "only @xmath0 of the difference of elliptic flow between ideal and viscous hydrodynamics comes from the reduction of the second component of the flow gradient by viscous forces .",
    "the rest comes from a modification of the cooper - frye @xcite formula at freeze - out @xcite .",
    "while this modification is generally demanded by energy - momentum conservation in the presence of a pre - existing flow gradient , non - equilibrium effects _ at freeze - out _ are now known @xcite to be capable of modifying the @xmath1 resulting from a given flow gradient by parametrically non - negligible factors .",
    "thus , the detailed dynamics of the decoupling of the fluid into particles , and their subsequent interactions , introduce a @xmath0 systematic effect in any determination of @xmath2 from comparison of hydrodynamic simulations with data , and needs to be properly accounted for .      in the next two sections , we present calculations of the bulk and shear viscosities for low density hadronic gases in terms of collision times .",
    "although the shear calculation is a familiar result @xcite , the bulk calculation is more complicated , but similar calculations can also be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "sophisticated calculations of the shear and bulk viscosity would account for differing relaxation times for different species or for particles with different momentum @xcite , something which could give rather non - trivial results close to the hagedorn temperature @xcite . by using simulations , calculations of the shear viscosity",
    "can more accurately incorporate effects from memory being transferred to colliding partners @xcite .",
    "the calculations of the next section are not meant to be competitive with these more realistic treatments .",
    "instead , these simple relaxation - time based calculations are included to provide background and context for the algorithms presented here to alter phase - space densities so that they are microscopically consistent with the relaxation time picture . by adjusting the relaxation time",
    ", one can reproduce any desired viscosity .",
    "although the bulk viscosity is zero for a gas of massless particles , or for a gas of non - relativistic particles , a small and nearly negligible bulk viscosity ensues for a gas of semi - relativistic particles . for a gas with a mixture of non - relativistic and highly relativistic particles , e.g. pions and nucleons ,",
    "one finds a larger , but still small , bulk viscosity .",
    "identical results are derived from the perspective of kubo relations , and from a more microscopic picture based on the evolving phase space density in the presence of velocity gradients .",
    "the next two sections present results for the bulk and shear viscosities respectively , and the subsequent section describes a consistent design of an interface between hydrodynamic and boltzmann models .",
    "the final section summarizes the findings .",
    "the bulk viscosity will be non - zero whenever the trace of the stress - energy tensor , @xmath18 , can differ from the equilibrium pressure , @xmath9 .",
    "the inability to maintain equilibrium is assumed to derive from rapidly changing densities , i.e. , @xmath19 . for a non - interacting gas of non - interacting particles ,",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the phase space density for particles of species @xmath22 . for massless particles , @xmath23 , and ,",
    "as long as the gas is isotropic ( @xmath24 depends on just @xmath25 and not on the angle of * p * with a preferred direction ) , one finds @xmath26 regardless of the form for @xmath24 .",
    "thus , there is no bulk viscosity for massless gases as the effective pressure is set as a function of the energy density , and is independent of kinetic thermalization .",
    "similarly for non - relativistic gases , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 again , this depends only on the energy and particle densities , and is independent of whether @xmath21 is in an equilibrated form and the gas has zero bulk viscosity .",
    "a gas of semi - relativistic particles can have @xmath29 by distributing the energy more or less amongst the higher or lower momentum modes .",
    "such a gas with @xmath30 can support a small , but negligible for heavy ion collisions , bulk viscosity .",
    "the results above are common knowledge in the relativistic heavy ion community . what is less known is that a modest bulk viscosity ensues for a gas with a mixture of non - relativistic and relativistic particles .",
    "this will be illustrated below .    for interacting systems",
    ", significant bulk viscosities can arise from several non - equilibrium effects @xcite . near a phase transition , where the vacuum expectations of fields may change suddenly",
    ", the finite equilibration time can lead to a peak in the bulk viscosity near @xmath31 .",
    "hints of this behavior can be seen in lattice results @xcite and ads / cft calculations @xcite , and the peak in viscosity could well have a significant effect on subsequent dynamics @xcite .",
    "long - range correlations from finite - range interactions or structures , e.g. polymers , experience frictional heating in an isotropic expansion and thus have bulk viscosities .",
    "non - equilibrium chemistry can also lead to a bulk viscosity , but only if one compares @xmath32 to the pressure calculated with the equilibrium density .",
    "if the densities of various species are calculated dynamically , and if non - equilibrium concentrations are then used to calculate the pressure , there is no need to add a bulk viscosity to account for the non - equilibrium pressure .",
    "similarly , if non - equilibrium mean fields are modeled dynamically @xcite the bulk viscosity associated with non - equilibrium fields can be ignored .",
    "in fact , incorporating the effects of non - equilibrium chemistry or fields through a bulk viscosity is potentially clumsy as the effects can easily become non - linear . for this study",
    ", we ignore the effects mentioned in this paragraph and consider only the case of a dilute gas where the viscosities are solely due to kinetic non - equilibrium .",
    "these effects are much smaller than those mentioned above , and should be the dominant sources at low density when particle interactions are of a purely binary character .",
    "we present calculation of the bulk viscosity of a dilute gas from two perspectives . for each calculation we neglect bose / fermi effects and assume that relaxation can be described with a single relaxation time independent of the particle s momentum or species type .",
    "this is certainly unrealistic , but the single - relaxation time derivation allows one to precisely relate the alteration to the phase - space density , @xmath33 , due to a change in the stress - energy tensor , @xmath34 .",
    "first , we calculate the bulk viscosity through the kubo relation for a dilute gas .",
    "this is done by first finding the fluctuation of the pressure for non - interacting particles , then multiplying by the relaxation time .",
    "the second calculation is based on a more dynamical picture based on the evolving phase space density in an isotropically expanding medium .",
    "both calculations yield the same result .",
    "the kubo relation for bulk viscosity , @xmath35 assumes the averaging is for states with fixed energy and fixed charges .",
    "`` charges '' refer to anything that is conserved on the time scale for which the correlation lasts .",
    "unfortunately , it is easier to calculate thermal averages in the grand canonical ensemble , which allows energy and charges to fluctuate . for the gc ensemble",
    ", one needs to replace @xcite @xmath36    the partial derivatives are complicated given that the pressure is most easily calculated in the gc ensemble as a function of the temperature @xmath37 and the chemical potentials for each species , @xmath38 .",
    "after some algebra , they can be expressed in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "since we consider only non - interacting hadrons , with no bose or fermi statistics , the expression simplifies by using @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 assuming simple exponential decays in time , characterized by a common relaxation time , the kubo relation can be calculated once one knows the equal - time fluctuations , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 could be any combination of the operators @xmath47 , @xmath48 or @xmath49 . for non - interacting particles ,",
    "the operators are of the form , @xmath50 where @xmath51 sums over all particles in the subvolume @xmath52 . for non - interacting particles , equal - time fluctuations of the type @xmath44 , which have sums of the type @xmath53",
    "are simplified by eliminating all @xmath54 terms , since different particles are uncorrelated and are thus unlikely to be in the same subvolume .",
    "the fluctuation of @xmath55 is then , @xmath56 with similar expressions for the other sums .",
    "one can then replace the sums with integrations over phase space with the phase space occupations for the species @xmath22 being @xmath57 . in terms of the inverse temperature , @xmath58 , and the scaled chemical potentials , @xmath59 ,",

    "@xmath89      according to the kubo relations , the viscosity is a product of an equal - time fluctuation and the relaxation time . the relaxation time , @xmath90 , falls roughly inversely with the density thus making both the shear and bulk viscosities strongly temperature dependent .",
    "the equal - time fluctuations also depend on temperature . for the bulk viscosity ,",
    "the fluctuation , @xmath91 , is zero for both the non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic limits .",
    "this can be understood by considering the behavior of the momenta as measured in the local rest - frame , @xmath92 for an isotropic velocity gradient , @xmath93 the corresponding change in the phase space density is proportional to @xmath94 for a change in the temperature and chemical potential , @xmath95 which means that for an ultra - relativistic particle , @xmath96 , the change in the phase space density is equivalent to a change in the temperature .",
    "the phase space occupancy is thus changed in a way consistent with changing the temperature , which means that the distribution remains thermal .",

    "the two cases have very different densities at low temperatures .",
    "due to the chemical non - equilibrium , the non - equilibrated state has many more particles due to the finite fugacities that develop @xcite , which gives much shorter relaxation times and thus much smaller viscosities . since the temperature range for which one would switch from hydrodynamics to microscopic prescriptions is in the neighborhood of 150 mev , the behaviors shown in fig .",

    "the principal motivations for altering the form would be to incorporate longer relaxation times for high energy particles , given that they may require multiple collisions to re - thermalize , or to give longer relaxation times to species with longer mean free paths .",
    "it has been shown that the difference between saturating @xmath1 values for different species , often associated with quark - number scaling in coalescence , might partially derive from different relaxation times @xcite . if two species are emitted from the same fireball , but characterized by different relaxation times , the species with the shorter relaxation time ( e.g. protons ) will have a more isotropic local momentum distribution .",
    "since the anisotropy of the local phase space density lowers @xmath1 , those particles with smaller relaxation times will then have higher values of @xmath1 .    comparing this procedure to the grad form described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gradform ] ) , reveals no difference if the departure from equilibrium is small , assuming an appropriate choice is made for @xmath129 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gradform ] ) . to see this",

    "( [ eq : adef ] ) was used to replace @xmath150 . by comparison with eq .",
    "( [ eq : gradform ] ) one can see that the two expressions are identical for small @xmath167 if @xmath215 for the assumption of uniform relaxation time applied thus far for the scaling procedure , @xmath148 was indpedendent of the momentum . however , one could in principle choose an arbitrary function form , i.e. , instead of the assumption that the scaling function @xmath150 is independent of momentum as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adef ] ) , one could instead have chosen , @xmath216 where @xmath217 could be any arbitrary function of the magnitude of the momentum ( recent developments show @xmath217 could indeed be non - trivial and species - dependent @xcite ) one would then retrace the procedure above and derive the value for @xmath218 .",
    "in the small @xmath16 limit , the grad form and the scaling procedure would then equate once one had chosen @xmath219 even if one were to use the grad form rather than the scaling procedure presented here , this expression offers insight as to how one might choose the form for @xmath129 .",
    "if one thought the relaxation time were independent of momentum , or particle species , one would choose @xmath129 consistent with @xmath217 being constant .",
    "otherwise , it would make most sense to choose @xmath217 proportional to the relaxation time . for higher momentum hadrons",
    ", one might expect longer relaxation times , not so much because of reductions in the overall cross sections , but because it can take several collisions for a high energy particle to completely lose memory of its momentum .",
    "the extreme case would be a high - energy jet , for which the relaxation time might be so large that it can not re - thermalize on the time scale of the expansion . in this limit both the grad form and the scaling procedure lose their validity .",
    "the grad form , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gradform ] ) , has drawbacks in that it yields negative phase space densities for large momentum .",
    "the momentum range for which the phase space densities become unphysical depends on the size of the viscous corrections . for correction of the order @xmath220 ,",
    "negative phase space densities ensue for momenta only a few times the thermal momentum .",
    "this problem occurs even for the case where @xmath217 is chosen to be a constant . if one chooses a functional form @xmath217 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdef ] ) that grows with momentum , the problems of negative phase space densities become all the more acute .",
    "the scaling algorithm outlined above also has some drawbacks in that one loses the equivalence between the non - equilibrium components of the generated stress - energy tensor and the non - equilibrium components used to determine the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adef ] ) is lost for large departures from equilibrium .",
    "one advantage of the procedure described above is that it accommodates monte carlo generation of particles in a fairly straight - forward manner .",
    "the procedure is also better behaved at large momentum . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdafdef ] ) , one can see that if all particles are given a fixed lifefime , i.e. @xmath217 is a constant , that the scaling matrix @xmath150 is independent of momentum , and as long as @xmath150 is not large , the linear approximation is reasonable for all momenta .",
    "however , if @xmath217 increases with momentum , there will again be some momentum range for which the approximation becomes unwarranted and perhaps even unphysical .",
    "both procedures have difficulty adjusting for bulk corrections to the stress - energy tensor , i.e. @xmath221 , as one must also adjust the temperature and chemical potentials to maintain fixed energy and particle number densities .",
    "once these densities are conserved , both forms require large deviations of the phase space density to produce small @xmath222 . although it would be straight - forward to do this consistently , linear approximations ( assuming that the modification factors are proportional to @xmath17 ) , are bound to run into difficulties such as negative phase space densities for specific momenta in the grad form , or for non - linear corrections overwhelming the linear corrections for the scaling procedure .",
    "given that the bulk corrections to the stress energy tensor tend to be less than one percent of the pressure in the region of hydrodynamic / microscopic interface , the best course of action may be to ignore the bulk correction altogether . this recommendation would change if the bulk correction were not small for the hadron case .",
    "such might be the case if the hadronic mean fields @xcite , e.g. the chiral condensate , are away from equilibrium .",
    "however , that would suggest adding a dynamic mean field to both the hydrodynamic and microscopic prescriptions @xcite , rather than attempting to incorporate the viscous corrections into the momentum distributions , which as shown in sec . [",
    "sec : bulk ] , can accommodate only small viscous corrections .",
    "by calculating the bulk and shear from both a dynamic perspective and from kubo relations , it is clear how one should alter the phase space distribution for a system where the relaxation time is independent of species or of momentum .",
    "the calculations of the bulk viscosity were especially useful , as they illustrate why the bulk viscosity is so small for most applications to heavy ion collisions .",
    "in particular , one can see that @xmath223 for both ultra - relativistic and non - relativistic system .",
    "a mixture of the massive ( @xmath224 ) and massless ( @xmath225 ) components leads to the largest values of @xmath226 , but even in those cases bulk viscosity from kinetic non - equilibrium is negligible for designing an interface between hydrodynamic and boltzmann models in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the viscous calculations alluded to above inspired the algorithm described in sec .",
    "[ sec : interface ] for interfacing hydrodynamic and microscopic descriptions .",
    "the method was based on generating particles with a thermal distribution , then scaling their momenta linearly with a matrix composed of a unit matrix plus a piece proportional to the non - equilibrium stress - energy tensor taken from the hydrodynamic calculation .",
    "the constant of proportionality was then expressed in terms of integrals of the thermal distributions .",
    "the method was shown to be better than one percent accurate as long as the non - equilibrium shear components of the stress - energy tensor remain @xmath227 one third of the equilibrium pressure .",
    "the method did not appear useful for accurately generating non - equilibrium deviations of the bulk pressure , although such deviations are so small they can be safely neglected .",
    "the method has an advantage over previously considered techniques to generate corrected phase space densities , in that the phase space densities remain positive for all momenta .",
