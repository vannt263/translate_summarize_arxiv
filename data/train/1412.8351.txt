    "rise of graphene certainly revived the interest to the classical graphite systems , presenting a wealth of not yet well understood electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "the challenge is related to the complicate semi - metallic multi - branch energy spectrum in the vicinity of the half - field fermi - level , caused by splitting of the dirac - cone graphene spectrum by the graphite - forming inter - carbon - layer coupling .",
    "the point of special interest is the crossover from graphene to graphite through the multilayer structures with few number of layers .",
    "it is well known that such systems may exhibit metallic or semiconductor behavior as a function of the number of layers and the stacking process latil2006,partoens2007,santos2007 , finkenstadt2008,koshino2013 , characteristic that makes them highly appealing for gated controlled electronic devices .",

    "particularly , a characteristic for graphene diamagnetic @xmath0-function singularity of susceptibility @xcite appears at the dirac point at @xmath1 . for even number of layers the magnetic properties are more similar to those for bilayer graphene koshino1 and the diamagnetic response has the weaker logarithmic divergency . such odd / even layer decomposition can give the coexistence of dirac and normal carriers , observed in the pure graphite lukyanchuk2004,lukyanchuk2006,lukyanchuk2009 .",

    "this gap , however can be filled by the energy level of novel electronic states , localized in the vicinity of the sample boundary @xcite . for nanoscopic and even for mesoscopic clusters these _ edge states",

    "the situation can drastically depend on size and shape of the clusters .",
    "even the geometrical structure of the edges ( armchair vs zigzag ) plays the important role ezawa , zhang2008,heiskanen . in general two types of edge states , located nearby the dirac point can be discerned , the zero energy states ( zes ) that are degenerate and located _ exactly _ at @xmath1 and the dispersed edge states ( des ) that fill the low - energy energy - spectra domain within the gap and are symmetrically distributed with respect to @xmath1 espinosa , zarenia , heiskanen , espinosa2    in this paper , we consider the electronic and magnetic properties of finite - size multilayer quantum dots ( mqd ) that should generalize the principal features of gqd in that sense as the described above extended multilayer systems grasp the properties of graphene . in particular we show that the edge state located close to @xmath1 are again responsible for the principal electronic properties , but the level arrangement inside the gap is more diverse as in gqd . to stress the most prominent aspects we consider the characteristics examples of mqd of hexagonal and of triangular shape having zigzag edges . for calculations we use the approach of tight binding ( tb ) model in the nearest neighbor ( nn ) approximation . for magnetic properties we are mostly concentrated on the orbital diamagnetic effects .",

    "the hamiltonian ( htb_s ) can be extended for the multilayer systems by taking into account the nn  hopping between the adjacent layers .",

    "the dos of _ triangular _ gqds ( fig.[figt ] ) reveals the remarkable feature : the large number of degenerate states is observed _ exactly _ at @xmath1 and is manifested by the huge central peak of zero energy states ( zes ) located inside the energy gap . this property was shown to be explained by the considerable imbalance of atoms in cluster sublattices @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite that leads to degeneracy    @xmath54    the wave functions of zes are localized mainly at the edges of the flake @xcite .",

    "similar to the single - layer case the energy gap with the interior central peak in dos is observed .",

    "importantly , they are not completely degenerate except the states appeared in the odd - layer clusters exactly at @xmath1 .",
    "another new property is the electron - hole asymmetry of dos with respect to the dirac point , @xmath59 . to examine the origin of these new features we tested the variation of dos under consecutive variation of the coupling parameters @xmath60 and found that this is the coupling @xmath61 which is responsible for the both effects .",

    "importantly , the term with @xmath73 and @xmath74 exists only for the odd number of layers .",

    "this residual degeneracy however is removed when the nnn couplings @xmath18 and @xmath28 are taken into account . for even number of layers",
    "only two - layers states contribute to @xmath63 and no peaks in dos appear within the size - quantization gap that vanishes with increasing of the cluster size @xcite .",
    "_ hexagonal _ mqds , in contrast to triangular mqds demonstrate practically the same structure of dos as the single - layer gqd with near - zero - energy dispersed electronic states ( fig.[fig_dosh ] ) .",

    "the large - energy scale plot of magnetic susceptibility for _ triangular _ mqds with @xmath75 demonstrates the random oscillations between diamagnetic and paramagnetic states ( fig.fig_st ) , similarly to what was observed for the single - layer case .",
    "typically , the absolute values of susceptibility for the odd - layer mqd is always higher than those for the even - layer mqds that can be explained by contribution of one decoupled single - layer , whose susceptibility is remarkably higher @xcite .",
    "however at @xmath55 the prominent asymmetric splash is revealed in the gap region , where for the @xmath76 case only the flat energy - independent plato was observed .",

    "the structure of @xmath50 for _ hexagonal _ mqd is approximately the same as for hexagonal gqd , albeit some asymmetry of the broad diamagnetic peak at @xmath55 appears .",
    "in this paper we studied the electronic and magnetic properties of mqd with zig - zag edges in nn tb approximation as function of the fermi energy and their relation with similar properties of gqd .",
    "the behavior of electronic dos and of orbital magnetic susceptibility in the near - zero energy region in vicinity of dirac point is found to be provided by the edge - localized electronic states .",
    "the details substantially depend on shape of mqd and on parity of layer number . in hexagonal mqd",
    "the situation is practically the same as in gqd , previously studied in espinosa2 : the quasi - continuum distribution of edge - localized levels is observed at @xmath55 that provides the broad diamagnetic peak in the orbital susceptibility .",
    "in contrast , in triangular mqd the qualitatively new feature appears . the highly - degenerate zes states , centered in the near - zero energy gap - region of triangular gqd , are split by the inter - layer coupling parameter @xmath61 onto the narrow multi - peak band .",
    "this gives the non typical splash - wavelet feature in the orbital diamagnetic susceptibility at dirac point , absent for gqd .    in our work",
    "we were focused on susceptibility arising from the orbital electronic properties whereas the spin - paramagnetic effects were not taken into account .",
    "meanwhile their role can be decisive in case of highly - degenerate electronic states at @xmath1 in the half - field triangular gqd with zig - zag edges .",
    "the smearing of zes into near - zero - energy band in mqd removes such degeneracy and one can assume that the spin - paramagnetic effects will be less pronounced there .",
    "meanwhile , this question is less trivial when the hubbard - u coulomb interaction and temperature - induced intra - band electron jumps are properly taken into account . therefore study of the competition between the temperature - independent orbital - diamagnetic and temperature - dependent spin - paramagnetic properties in mqd posses the challenging problem for many - body statistical physics .",
    "these effects can be discerned experimentally , basing on the temperature dependence of susceptibility .",
    "another interesting property that we observed is the electron - hole asymmetry with respect to the level with @xmath1 , provided by the same interlayer coupling parameter @xmath61 .",
    "being of the same origin as asymmetric semi - metallic multi - branch spectrum of electron - hole carriers in graphite this feature can result in the non - zero location of fermi - level in the half - field mqd .",
    "oscillation of finite dos at fermi - level as function of magnetic field can give the quasi- de haas van alphen oscillations similar to those observed in the bulk graphite .",
    "study of their character and comparison with graphite presents another challenging problem ."
