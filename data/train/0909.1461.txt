    "priority - based queueing models are of interest among statistical physics community recently @xcite .",
    "they were originally introduced in the context of human dynamics @xcite , aiming to model individual s internal decision making process underlying observed human activity patterns , yet bear implications to other problems in statistical physics such as the bak - sneppen model for biological evolution @xcite and invasion percolation @xcite as well , from the extremal dynamics perspective .",
    "thus the understanding of dynamics of the priority - queue models is of broader interest beyond the human dynamics .",
    "the primary fingerprint of priority - queue dynamics is the heavy tail in the waiting time distribution @xmath0 , often taking an asymptotic power - law form for large waiting times , @xmath1 where the waiting time @xmath2 is the time interval between two consecutive events . in the original single fixed - length queue model by barabsi @xcite ,",
    "the exponent @xmath3 was obtained numerically , which was verified analytically later @xcite .",
    "such heavy - tailed dynamics have been observed for a range of human activities such as the e - mail , library loan , web browsing , and call initiation from a mobile phone @xcite , prompting further interests and debates .",
    "later on , the barabsi model has been modified to include different factors such as memory and multi - task executions that would be of potential relevance in human decision making @xcite . among them",
    ", one of the most confounding factor would be the human interaction @xcite : in a modern society , the activity of an individual is rarely an outcome of completely autonomous decisions , but of delicate compromises and balanced conflicts between often competing priorities of various settings in complex social networks @xcite . beyond its sociological context , the human interaction introduces coupling of multiple queue dynamics , rendering the model highly nontrivial .",
    "thus the study of the role of human interaction on priority - queue dynamics is of theoretical interest as well .",
    "there are a few studies investigating the impact of interactions on the patterns of priority - queue dynamics .",
    "oliveira and vazquez introduced a model of two interacting priority queues with and - type interaction @xcite , and found that the waiting time distribution @xmath0 of the model is still a power law for large @xmath2 , yet with different exponents such as @xmath4 for the @xmath5-tasks in the @xmath6 case .",
    "their model has been further generalized into the priority - queue _ networks _ of @xmath7 interacting queues @xcite , where it is found that the and - type interaction is not suitable for the network with loops when @xmath7 , leading to frozen , trivial queue dynamics .",
    "therefore a scalable interaction of or - type rule is introduced in the priority - queue network ( the or model @xcite ) .",
    "the or model leads to different @xmath0 than the and - type one and the power - law exponent @xmath8 is found to depend on various factors such as the network size , global network topology , and local position of a queue node in a diverse way .",
    "these works have demonstrated that the interaction is indeed a relevant and consequential factor in the priority - queue dynamics .    in this paper , we extend the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , and consider further forms of human interaction in the priority - queue networks . here",
    "we are specifically interested in two factors : the team - based task execution and the hierarchy in decision making .",
    "the former refers to the situation when a task demands simultaneous actions of more than two individuals and an individual s decision is affected by more than one others .",
    "the latter applies when there is a hierarchy in the queue nodes status in a way that a node in higher hierarchy can order the execution of a task to the node in lower hierarchy .",
    "both forms of human interaction are encountered in many real - life situations , thus the understanding of their impact is essential for a more complete human dynamics modeling , as well as for a more thorough understanding of the priority - queue network dynamics in general .",
    "-5 mm    =    -5 mm",
    "the models studied in this paper are built upon the priority - queue network model of ref .",
    "@xcite , with newly - introduced interaction rules . depending on the interaction rule ,",
    "each queue node has @xmath9 @xmath5-tasks and an @xmath10-task @xmath11 . initially each task is given a priority value drawn from a uniform distribution in @xmath12 .",
    "then each step , a queue node is chosen randomly ( say it to be @xmath13 ) and its highest priority task is identified . if it is an @xmath5-task , its execution is challenged against the queue discipline ( interaction rules ) of the particular model .",
    "if the selected @xmath5-task does pass the challenge , the node @xmath13 and all other nodes involved in the task executes it simultaneously .",
    "otherwise , only the node @xmath13 executes its @xmath10-task instead . upon execution , the waiting time @xmath2 of the tasks is recorded , and the executed tasks are replaced with new tasks each with a random priority value in uniform @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath14 such updates constitute a monte carlo step , which is the time unit of waiting time measurement .",
    "_ interaction rule in the team - based task execution _ in the team - based task execution model , each @xmath5-task is associated with a group of queue nodes of size @xmath15 , meaning that more than two individuals are involved in the execution of the task . here",
    "the size of a team @xmath15 is the important parameter characterizing the model .",
    "we call it an @xmath16-model hereafter . in the @xmath16-model ,",
    "each queue @xmath13 has @xmath17 @xmath5-tasks plus an @xmath10-task , thus is of equal fixed length of @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "1a ) . in this model , when a node ( chosen randomly in each step ) has the @xmath5-task , @xmath19 , as its highest priority task , all the nodes in the team @xmath20 executes it at the step ; an or - type rule .",
    "the case with @xmath21 is the same as the original or model with the pairwise task execution of ref .",
    "@xcite . as @xmath22 ,",
    "the number of @xmath5-tasks @xmath9 changes drastically , which is expected to affect the queue network s dynamics and thus is of interest in this work .",
    "this model can be thought of as the generalization of the priority - queue network model into the priority - queue hypergraphs .",

    "when a node @xmath13 ( @xmath13-th in the hierarchy ) chooses its @xmath5-task to be the highest priority , all the lower hierarchy nodes ( from @xmath27 to @xmath14 ) follow to execute it simultaneously with the node @xmath13 .",
    "depending on the node s position in the hierarchy , the degree of interruption ( number of @xmath5-task calls from other nodes ) varies , the effect of which is of interest in this work .",

    "the waiting time dynamics is found to have the same asymptotics as the @xmath21 case ( fig .  2 , @xmath33 ,  @xmath34 ,  @xmath35 ) .",
    "notable exception is the @xmath5-task dynamics for @xmath36 , for which the waiting time exponent is larger than the other cases as @xmath37 ( figs .",
    "2a - c , @xmath35 ) .",
    "interestingly , this distinct power - law exponent for @xmath36 has also been observed in the pairwise @xmath38 or model on fully - connected networks . there",
    "the case with @xmath39 exhibits a distinct power - law exponent than other cases with @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the origin of this distinct behavior of @xmath36 case is not fully understood yet , calling for a further study . for the @xmath10-task dynamics , although the probability density for large @xmath2 becomes elevated with @xmath15 , the power - law exponent remains unchanged ( figs .",

    "for @xmath41 , each queue node has one @xmath5-task and one @xmath10-task , similar to the @xmath45 or model .",
    "however , the @xmath5-task should be executed if any one queue has the @xmath5-task as its highest priority task , giving a disproportionately high probability to @xmath5-task executions , thereby leading to the exponential - like @xmath0 for the @xmath5-task . meanwhile , from the perspective of the @xmath10-task , the situation is not different from that of the @xmath45 or model , thereby leading to the same exponent @xmath46 as that of the @xmath45 or model @xcite .    in the @xmath16-model , the mean @xmath5-task",
    "waiting time is finite but the variance diverges for @xmath47 @xmath48 . for the @xmath10-task , not only the variance but also the mean waiting time diverge @xmath49 , implying the lack of characteristic scale in the waiting times dynamics @xcite .",

    "3 , we show the @xmath0 of the @xmath23-model with @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in the @xmath23-model , the node at the top of hierarchy ( @xmath24 )",
    "is not affected by any other nodes in its decision making .",
    "thus the @xmath24 node s dynamics , having one @xmath5-task and one @xmath10-task , is the same as that of the barabsi queue with length @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "thus we have @xmath52 for both the @xmath5-task and @xmath10-task for the @xmath24 node ( fig .  3 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "the @xmath5-task dynamics of nodes with @xmath53 is found to follow the power - law @xmath0 with the same exponent @xmath54 , although these nodes @xmath5-task dynamics is affected by the nodes in the higher hierarchy .",
    "this behavior can be understood by the following argument . in the @xmath23-model ,",
    "a node s @xmath5-task dynamics is the superposition of subdynamics having power - law @xmath0 with tail exponent @xmath55 , originating from the node itself and its higher hierarchy nodes . due to the singular nature of the power - law distribution with the exponent @xmath55 ,",
    "the superposed dynamics maintains the same tail exponent @xmath3 , upto the characteristic @xmath2 which decreases with @xmath56 , namely the number of superposed subdynamics .",
    "therefore , @xmath5-task dynamics of the @xmath23-model follows the power - law @xmath0 with the same exponent @xmath54 independent of node s position in the hierarchy .",
    "meanwhile , although the power - law exponent @xmath57 is close to @xmath58 , the mean waiting time is finite , as the mean value is dominated by the strong peak of @xmath0 at @xmath59 .",
    "however , the power - law tail with @xmath54 means that once the @xmath5-task is shelved incidentally , it may wait for an extremely long time before execution .",
    "the @xmath10-task dynamics of nodes with @xmath53 is affected more significantly by the hierarchical decision . for these nodes ,",
    "the relative priority of the @xmath10-task can be changed by the forced execution of the @xmath5-task following the call from the higher hierarchy nodes .",
    "thus the situation becomes similar to the @xmath10-task dynamics in the or model with @xmath45 nodes having @xmath46 , where the @xmath5-task priority can be updated via the @xmath5-task call from the other node regardless of its own priority value .",
    "this similarity explains the exponent @xmath46 for the @xmath53 nodes in the @xmath23-model .",
    "whereas for the highest hierarchy @xmath60 node the mean @xmath10-task waiting time is finite , for @xmath53 nodes it is marginally diverging @xmath61 , suggesting a lack of the characteristic waiting time .",
    "in this paper , we have considered two additional forms of interaction in the priority - queue network models , motivated by the team - based task execution and hierarchy - based decision - making , which are encountered in many real - life human activities .",
    "our numerical study has shown that these generalizations maintain the power - law decaying waiting time distribution @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , yet yield different values of the exponent @xmath8 depending on the model parameters .",
    "most of the power - law behaviors exhibited by the team - based @xmath16-model are found to have a counterpart in the pairwise or model s dynamics .",
    "this suggests that the two - body interactions may contain the most fundamental dynamic consequence of interactions in the priority - queue network dynamics , although the precise mechanism of these correspondences has yet to be understood , due to the lack of analytic results . for the hierarchical decision - based @xmath23-model ,",
    "it is found somewhat counterintuitively that it is the @xmath10-task dynamics , rather than the @xmath5-task dynamics , that is more strongly affected due to the hierarchical , directional interaction , compared to the reciprocal interaction case of the pairwise or model in which both the @xmath5- and @xmath10-task dynamics are affected .",
    "it thus highlights the nontrivial role of reciprocity of interaction in the priority - queue dynamics .",
