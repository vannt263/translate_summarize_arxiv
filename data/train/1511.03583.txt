    "anyone who has tried to hang a coat on a corner of a table knows the futility of such an endeavor .",
    "in fact , for a frictionless rectangular table the coat will slide toward the corner even if that corner is tilted upward . this situation is reminiscent of a double - cone that rolls up an incline , which is a nice classroom demonstration .",
    "the double - cone moves to lower its center of gravity even while its end points ascend on v - shaped rails @xcite . due to this seemingly paradoxical motion ,",
    "a double - cone has significant pedagogical appeal , yet there have been very few quantitative studies of the dynamics of this demonstration @xcite .",
    "this lack of analysis is likely due to the difficulty in identifying the points of contact between the double - cone and the rails @xcite .",
    "here we provide a simple mechanical model to emulate the motion of the coat on the corner of a table .",
    "this example consists of a massless string that connects two hanging masses and slides up an inclined plane .",
    "similar to the motion of the double cone , here , as the string moves up the incline , the center of gravity of the system moves down .",
    "however , unlike the double - cone , this system is easy to investigate and is well within the capabilities of undergraduate students .",
    "we consider two equal masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 connected via an ideal string of length @xmath2 that is symmetrically placed over the corner @xmath3 of a frictionless table , as depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : twoballs ] .     and @xmath1 connected by an ideal string of length @xmath2 , falling symmetrically over the corner of a horizontal table .",
    "note that point @xmath4 moves toward point @xmath3 , opposite to the directed segment @xmath5.,width=321 ]    the center point of the string is labelled @xmath4 .",
    "initially the system is at rest with the masses at table height and horizontally separated by the length @xmath2 of the string .",
    "we first investigate the motion of the system assuming a horizontal table .",
    "then we will show that the corner of the table can be tilted upwards by an angle @xmath6 and the point @xmath4 will still accelerate upward toward the table s corner , and we determine an upper limit for the angle @xmath6 .",
    "as the system is released and point @xmath4 advances toward the corner , we will be interested in finding the acceleration of @xmath4 as a function of time and as a function of the angle @xmath7 subtended by the edges of the table at the corner @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : twoballs ] ) . for this",
    "we want to find the motion of the two masses and of their center of mass .",
    "the central point @xmath4 moves along the bisector of angle @xmath7 , which we take to be the @xmath8-axis with the origin at @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twoballs ] ) .",
    "the center of mass of the system moves along the @xmath8-axis towards @xmath3 and also moves down along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "initially , the center of mass of the system is at the level of the table , at @xmath10 . some time after release , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoballs ] , masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 have descended by a vertical distance @xmath11 as point @xmath4 moves along @xmath8 towards the vertex @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the angle that the hanging masses make with the vertical , which is indicative of the acceleration of the masses ( it will be shown later that this angle is constant ) .",
    "mass @xmath0 moves along side @xmath13 of the table and vertically along @xmath9 , with mass @xmath1 moving symmetrically along the other edge of the table .",
    "we begin by determining the angle @xmath12 for the general case of a tilted table .",
    "we now consider a table that is tilted by angle @xmath6 symmetrically about the bisector of angle @xmath7 so that corner @xmath3 is the highest point , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tiltedplanes ] .",
    "moreover , we assume the string is oriented so that the portion in contact with the top of the table is always horizontal .",
    "because the table is assumed frictionless , the interaction between a piece of string and the table will always be perpendicular to the surface of the table , and we denote by @xmath14 the force of the table on the small portion of the string that is in contact with the edge of the table .    .",
    ", width=321 ]    the tension forces acting on this portion of string are given by @xmath15 for the segment of the string on the table , and by @xmath16 for the hanging segment of the string , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are unit vectors that point along these string segments ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tiltedplanes ] ) .",
    "note that , owing to our assumptions of a massless string and the smoothness of the table , the tension can be safely assumed to be uniform along the string .",
    "because the string is strictly massless , the net force on any segment must be zero ; applying this to the portion of the string in contact with the edge of the table then gives @xmath19 .",
    "this equation tells us that @xmath20 , and this vector must be perpendicular to the unit vector @xmath21 that points along the edge of the table .",
    "considering that the motion of ball @xmath0 is confined to a vertical plane containing the edge of the table , we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : tiltedplanes ] that we can write @xmath18 as a linear combination of unit vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constant coefficients .",
    "we need to determine these coefficients in order to find the angle @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath27 is a unit vector , we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , because @xmath30 , the fact that @xmath31 is perpendicular to @xmath22 implies that @xmath32 . hence , taking the dot product of @xmath21 with eq .",

    "( [ eq : coefffcients1 ] ) and ( [ eq : coefffcients2 ] ) for @xmath26 we find @xmath34 and , guided by fig .",
    "[ fig : tiltedplanes ] , we choose the negative sign . having found @xmath26 , the coefficient @xmath25 is then found to be @xmath35    we can now determine the angle @xmath12 defined by @xmath36 .",
    "this angle is a crucial parameter that is related to the acceleration in the forward direction because the masses only accelerate horizontally when @xmath37 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansionof_ell ] ) , we have @xmath38    which gives @xmath39 note that for a horizontal table , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , angle @xmath12 should be positive . thus , choosing the negative sign in eq .",
    "( [ e : beta1 ] ) we obtain @xmath42 which , for a horizontal table , gives @xmath43    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] , this last relationship can be verified experimentally .",
    "note that if we start the system from a different initial configuration where @xmath12 differs from @xmath44 , and the two masses hang symmetrically at a given depth below the table , then the angle @xmath12 will not remain constant , as the onset of the motion will induce oscillations of the moving masses .",
    "in this section we return the case of a horizontal table , which has @xmath45 , @xmath41 , and @xmath46 . from the geometry of the system ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : twoballs ] ) , we have @xmath47 and @xmath48 mass @xmath0 moves along side @xmath13 with speed @xmath49 and along @xmath50 with speed @xmath51 , so its velocity vector is @xmath52 .",

    "at this point we are well equipped to describe the motion of the two masses .",
    "we consider only mass @xmath0 , because the motion of @xmath1 follows by symmetry . as the system evolves , from eqs .",
    "( [ e : balls1 ] ) and ( [ e : balls2 ] ) we find that @xmath0 moves along the edge of the table with acceleration @xmath65 and along @xmath50 with acceleration @xmath66 to determine the trajectory , we express the position of mass @xmath0 in terms of the coordinates @xmath67 and @xmath9 , as measured from the origin @xmath3 ; that is , the position vector of mass @xmath0 is given by @xmath68 .",
    "assuming the masses are released from rest at the height of the table , we have @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the initial position of the mass along the edge of the table , and we have made use of eq .",
    "[ e : balls_acceleration ] in the last line . at the same time",
    ", we have @xmath71 these equations give a linear trajectory for the mass described by @xmath72    the acceleration of mass @xmath0 can be found from eqs .",
    "[ eq : l(t ) ] and [ eq : z(t ) ] as @xmath73 . \\ ] ] for a horizontal table , the vectors @xmath21 and @xmath74 are orthogonal , so the magnitude of the acceleration is @xmath75 , which is precisely the acceleration that results when a mass slides down a frictionless incline of angle @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the motion of mass @xmath0 is quite similar to the motion that would result if the table were folded along the bisector of the corner angle ( along @xmath8 in fig .  1 ) .",
    "when @xmath77 ( and hence @xmath78 ) the system will not move and @xmath79 .",
    "but as @xmath63 , the components @xmath80 and @xmath81 so that @xmath82 approaches @xmath83 as expected .",
    "because @xmath1 moves symmetrically on the other side of the table , the magnitude of its acceleration will be identical : @xmath84 .",
    "interestingly , from eq .  [",
    "e : balls_acceleration ] we see that @xmath85 , which demonstrates that point @xmath4 also accelerates as if it were sliding down an incline of angle @xmath76 .",
    "this result is not a simple coincidence .",
    "let us consider that we are folding up the table along the bisector while keeping the edges horizontal as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : folding](a ) .",
    "this ( tent - like ) structure is completely equivalent to the initial horizontal table , as all the constraints derived in section [ sec : dynamic ] remain the same , leading to @xmath46 .",
    "hence , both point @xmath4 and mass @xmath0 move with accelerations of the same magnitude @xmath86 . in the limiting case of a completely folded table ,",
    "one simply obtains an incline of angle @xmath76 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : folding](b ) ) . in this case , if the motion is started with the string perpendicular to the incline , it follows that again , both point p and the mass @xmath0 move synchronously with accelerations of the same magnitude .",
    "the center of mass of the system moves simultaneously along the @xmath8 and @xmath9 axes , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm ] ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : twoballs ] ) .",
    "thus , the center of mass descends on a oblique path making an angle @xmath87 with respect to the horizontal .        to determine @xmath87 , we note that mass @xmath0 hangs at an angle @xmath12 with respect to the vertical axis , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . if @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the position vectors for masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , then the center of mass position is given by @xmath90 .",
    "as previously discussed , the position of mass @xmath0 can be written @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath93 given by eqs .",
    "[ eq : l(t ) ] and [ eq : z(t ) ] , respectively . in this equation",
    ", we write @xmath94 to represent the unit vector along the edge of the table for mass @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the position of mass @xmath1 is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the unit vector along the edge of the table for mass @xmath1 .",
    "using the geometry of fig .  2 to note that @xmath97 , the position of the center of mass then becomes @xmath98 \\hat{w } + z(t)\\,\\hat{z},\\ ] ] where , for a horizontal table , we have used @xmath99 .",
    "the acceleration of the center of mass can be found by differentiating the position vector twice .",
    "carrying out the differentiation and again making use of eqs .",
    "[ eq : l(t ) ] and [ eq : z(t ) ] , we find that the center of mass undergoes a constant acceleration @xmath100 .",
    "\\label{eq : a_cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because the center of mass starts from rest , its trajectory points in the same direction as the ( constant ) acceleration .",
    "using the acceleration components in eq .",
    "[ eq : a_cm ] , the angle of the center - of - mass trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm ] is found to be @xmath101 in the limit @xmath63 ( so that @xmath102 ) , the acceleration of the center of mass becomes @xmath103 , while the angle of the trajectory approaches @xmath104 , as expected .",
    "so far we have been considering the motion of the string on a horizontal plane .",
    "we now relax this constraint and find , surprisingly , that the string will slide _ up _ an inclined plane .",
    "for a given corner angle @xmath7 , we can tilt the table upwards at an arbitrary angle @xmath6 by symmetrically raising the point @xmath3 in such a way so that the two edges of the table intersecting at @xmath3 make the same angle with the horizontal .",
    "it is then natural to determine the maximum tilt angle @xmath105 for which point @xmath4 still moves towards @xmath3 .",
    "the angle @xmath12 that the hanging mass makes with the vertical ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tiltedplanes ] ) , expressed in eq .",
    "( [ e : beta1 ] ) in terms of @xmath106 , is essential for ensuring that there is a forward acceleration ( e.g. , @xmath78 signals that the string is vertical and hence there is no horizontal force on the masses , and hence no pull towards the corner ) .",
    "thus , we need to relate @xmath12 to the angle of inclination @xmath6 of the table . from fig .  [",
    "fig : tiltedplanes ] , because the vectors @xmath22 , @xmath17 , and @xmath107 all lie on the plane of the table , we can deduce that @xmath108 . taking the scalar product of this relation with @xmath74 , we get @xmath109 where we have used @xmath110 and @xmath111 . meanwhile , from eq .",
    "( [ e : beta0 ] ) we know that @xmath112 combining these last two equations , we obtain the connection between the dynamical angle @xmath12 , the inclination of the table @xmath6 , and the corner angle @xmath7 : @xmath113    to find the maximum angle @xmath105 at which the string will no longer be able to climb , we note that there will be no acceleration towards @xmath3 when the angle @xmath12 becomes zero , which implies @xmath114 this is a quadratic equation for @xmath115 that can be solved to give @xmath116 thus , for @xmath117 we find @xmath118 ; that is , the string will advance towards the corner for _ any _ angle of inclination except a vertical table . in a moment we will show that this is also true for @xmath119 .",
    ", the center of mass moves along the horizontal dashed line.,width=245 ]    note that we could have determined the angle @xmath105 from the geometry of the table as well .",
    "the upward motion of @xmath4 is possible only if the center of mass of the system moves downward .",
    "hence , from fig .  [ fig : maxangle ] we see that when the inclination @xmath6 reaches the maximum value @xmath105 , the corner of the table should be a distance @xmath120 higher than the initial location of point @xmath4 . in this geometry , the center of mass will move exactly horizontally as point @xmath4 moves up the plane , which gives @xmath121 thus , we arrive at the same condition as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thetamax1 ] ) .",
    "note also that for small values of @xmath7 , we have @xmath122 , and in general @xmath123 .",
    "figure  [ fig : vertical](a ) shows that for @xmath124 and a vertical table , the masses ( and hence the center of mass ) will remain at the same height as point @xmath4 is moved toward @xmath3 . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig : vertical](b ) shows that for a vertical table with a corner angle @xmath125 the masses ( and hence the center of mass ) will _ decrease _ in height as point @xmath4 moves toward @xmath3 . in practice , of course",
    ", it is impossible to have a completely frictionless apparatus .",
    "therefore , the motion will most likely cease before reaching a vertical tilt of the table",
    ".     leads to no change in height for the masses .",

    "we analyzed a system that consists of two identical masses connected by an ideal string placed symmetrically over a corner of a frictionless table . on a horizontal table , the string moves towards the corner for any value of the corner angle @xmath7 . if the table is tilted upward , we find that the string still moves towards the corner provided that the tilting angle is less than a critical value .",
    "this system is reminiscent of a double - cone rolling up a set of inclined v - shaped rails . the double - cone s motion , while relatively easy to demonstrate , is rather difficult to analyze .",
    "the example considered here is straightforward to understand , and it does not involve the subtleties of the three - dimensional geometry required for the involved analysis of the double - cone problem .",
    "indeed , we find that the corner problem is not without intrigue",
    ". if the corner angle is greater than @xmath126 , then the string will slide up and jump over the corner , even for a vertical plane .",
