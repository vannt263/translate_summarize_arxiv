    "black holes ( bhs ) are one of the most puzzling legacies of general relativity .",
    "their existence implies that space - time is geodesically incomplete and has at least one singular point where physical quantities are divergent .",
    "furthermore , semiclassical considerations reveal , rather surprisingly , that bhs radiate and have an associated thermodynamics .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that a quantum gravity theory might allow for an underlying statistical mechanical explanation of the thermodynamical properties of bhs and shed some light on the prevalence and possible evolution of space - time singularities .    in this respect , given that a quantum gravity theory is not within grasp , a quantum cosmology approach based on the mininsuperspace approximation might bring some insight about the prevalence of singularities under quantum conditions .",
    "furthermore , the evidence that noncommutative features are present in string theory , one of the most discussed quantum gravity proposals , suggests that some noncommutativity structure should be equally included into the quantum cosmology approach .",
    "this means that one should seek for a noncommutative version of the wheeler - de witt equation .",
    "this generalization has been carried out in the context of the kantowski - sachs ( ks ) cosmological model for the most general ( canonical ) noncommutative algebra , namely the one that includes noncommutativity of the momentum variables as well @xcite .",
    "an additional bonus of this approach is that the ks model can be used to study the interior region of a schwarzschild bh .",
    "thus , the aim of the present work is to use the phase - space noncommutative generalization of the ks cosmological model developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to examine the interior of a schwarzschild bh . as we shall see",
    "this will allow for a proper treatment of the bh thermodynamics , contrary to what happens when momentum noncommutativity is absent , and for an analysis of the impact of the quantum and noncommutative effects on the issue of singularities .",
    "let us start our discussion with the description of a schwarzschild bh .",
    "general relativity allows for solutions where the causal structure of space - time changes at different regions of space - time .",
    "a well known example is the schwarzschild bh , described by the following metric , [ eq0.1 ] ds^2=-(1 - 2mr)dt^2+(1 - 2mr)^-1dr^2+r^2(d^2+^2d^2 )  , where @xmath2 is the radial coordinate .",
    "the fact that the first component of the metric vanishes at @xmath3 defines the horizon of events for the schwarzschild bh .",
    "for @xmath4 the time and radial coordinates are interchanged ( @xmath5 ) so that space - time is described by the metric [ eq0.2 ] ds^2=-(2mt-1)^-1dt^2+(2mt-1)dr^2+t^2(d^2+^2d^2 )  .",
    "this means that an isotropic metric turns into an anisotropic one , implying that the interior of a schwarzschild bh can be described by an anisotropic cosmological space - time .",
    "indeed , the metric ( [ eq0.2 ] ) can be mapped to the metric of the ks cosmological model @xcite , which , in the misner parametrization , can be written as [ eq1.4 ] ds^2=-n^2dt^2+e^2dr^2+e^-2e^-2(d^2+^2d^2 )  , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are scale factors , and @xmath8 is the lapse function . the following identification for @xmath9 , [ eq0.3 ]",
    "n^2=(2mt-1)^-1 , e^2 = ( 2mt-1 ) , e^-2e^-2=t^2  , allows for turning the metric eq .",
    "( [ eq1.4 ] ) into the metric eq .",
    "( [ eq0.2 ] ) away from the horizon @xmath10 , the coordinate singularity .    in what follows",
    "we shall assume that , at the quantum level , the interior of the bh is described by the phase - space noncommutative extension of the quantum ks cosmological model .",
    "in this setting , the noncommutative wheeler - de witt ( ncwdw ) equation has been recently obtained and its solutions calculated explicitly @xcite . as we shall see , the introduction of momentum noncommutativity changes the wdw equation and has a significant impact on the functional form of its solutions .",
    "the new wdw equation allows for consistently calculating the partition function for the schwarzschild bh through the feynman - hibbs procedure @xcite and then on all the relevant thermodynamic quantities .",
    "this , as we will see , is in contrast with what happens in the commutative and configuration space noncommutative cases .",
    "moreover , the solutions of the ncwdw equation provide a new insight into the problem of the bh singularity",
    ". we will show that these solutions vanish in the neighbourhood of @xmath1 , but that this does not necessarily imply a vanishing probability of finding the system at the singularity .",
    "we conclude that the canonical phase - space noncommutativity discussed in this work is insufficient to ensure the avoidance of singularities , but quite interestingly , our results strongly suggest that the singularity may be removed through other , slightly different , forms of momentum noncommutativity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we start by recalling the main features of phase - space noncommutative quantum mechanics ( ncqm ) and quantum cosmology in section ii . in section iii , we use the solutions of the phase - space ncwdw equation to obtain the relevant thermodynamical properties of the schwarzschild bh through the feynman - hibbs procedure . in section",
    "iv we discuss the implications of our results for the bh singularity issue .",
    "section v contains our conclusions .",
    "it is believed that the theory of quantum gravity will determine the ultimate structure of space - time at the planck scale .",
    "it has been pointed out that at this scale space - time might have a noncommutative structure , as suggested , for instance by string theory @xcite . in this work",
    "we use units such that @xmath11 , which imply for the planck length and mass @xmath12 .    at the quantum mechanical level",
    ", noncommutativity has been extensively discussed @xcite . in this instance , one considers canonical extensions of the heisenberg - weyl algebra , where time is assumed to be a commutative parameter and the theory is set in a @xmath13-dimensional phase - space of operators with noncommuting position and momentum variables .",
    "the noncommutative algebra reads , [ eq1.1 ] = i_ij , = i _ ij , = i _ ij , i , j= 1 , ... , d where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are antisymmetric real constant ( @xmath16 ) matrices and @xmath17 is the identity matrix .",
    "the extended algebra is related to the standard heisenberg - weyl algebra : [ eq1.2 ] = 0 , = i _ ij , = 0 , i , j= 1 , ... , d  , by a class of linear ( non - canonical ) transformations : [ eq1.3 ] q_i = q_i ( r_j , _ j ) , p_i = p_i ( r_j , _ j )  . in the mathematics literature",
    "this mapping is usually referred to as darboux ( d ) map @xcite .",
    "a phase - space noncommutative extension of a quantum cosmology was studied in ref .",
    "the presence of at least two scale factors is necessary to consider such an extension and the ks cosmological model , based on the metric eq .",
    "( [ eq1.4 ] ) , is a most natural candidate . in this case , we impose the following ( noncommutative ) classical poisson algebra on the scale factors @xmath7 , @xmath6 and their conjugate momenta @xmath18 , @xmath19 [ eq1.4.1 ]    l l \\ { , p _ } = 1 & \\ { , p _ } = 1 + & + \\ { , } = & \\{p _ , p _ } =  .    the remaining brackets vanish .    following the adm procedure and taking @xmath20 as configuration variables",
    ", one can derive the hamiltonian constraint for this system , [ eq1.5 ] h = nh = ne^+2  .",
    "the lapse function for the hamiltonian problem associated to metric eq .",
    "( [ eq1.4 ] ) , @xmath8 , is chosen as @xmath21 @xcite . with this choice ,",
    "the classical equations of motion simplify drastically .",
    "for the algebra ( [ eq1.4.1 ] ) , these read : [ eq1.6 ] & & = -2p _  , ( a ) + & & = 2p_-96e^-2  , ( b ) + & & = 2p_-96e^-2  , ( c ) + & & = 2p _",
    ".(d ) an analytical solution of this system is beyond reach , given the entanglement among the four variables .",
    "however , a numerical solution can be obtained and used to provide predictions for several relevant physical quantities @xcite . despite the difficulty to obtain analytic solutions",
    "one notices that eqs .",
    "( [ eq1.6]a ) and ( [ eq1.6]d ) yield a constant of motion [ eq1.7 ] = -(-2p_)=-p_+=c  , which will play an important role in solving the phase - space ncwdw equation .",
    "the canonical quantization of the classical hamiltonian constraint , @xmath22 , based on the ordinary heisenberg - weyl algebra , yields the commutative wdw equation for the wave function of the universe . for the simplest factor ordering of operators this equation reads [ eq1.8 ] ( , ) = 0  .",
    "where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the fundamental momentum operators conjugate to @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . here , on the other hand , we shall perform the quantization of the classical algebra ( [ eq1.4.1 ] ) .",
    "we thus obtain the following noncommutative heisenberg - weyl algebra : [ eq1.8.1 ]    l l = i & = i + & + = i & = i  .",
    "the remaining commutators vanish .",
    "the simplest way to implement algebra ( [ eq1.8.1 ] ) in this context is through a suitable d map ( i.e. a non - unitary linear transformation mapping the noncommutative algebra into the standard heisenberg - weyl algebra ) @xcite [ eq1.9 ] = _ c-2 p__c , = _ c + 2 p__c  , + p_= p__c + 2 _ c , p_=p__c- 2 _ c  , where from now on the index @xmath27 denotes commutative variables , i.e. variables for which @xmath28=\\left[\\hat p_{\\omega_c } , \\hat p_{\\beta_c}\\right]=0 $ ] and @xmath29=\\left[\\hat{\\beta}_c , \\hat p_{\\beta_c}\\right]=i$ ] . the transformation eqs .",
    "( [ eq1.9 ] ) can be inverted , provided [ eq1.91 ] 0x_0 < -1 ( )  .",
    "we then get for the potential function @xmath30 to second order in @xmath31 : [ eq2.6 ] v(x)=48(6e^-2x_0-^2)(x - x_0)^2 + 48 e^-2x_0 - ( x_0-c)^2  .",
    "so , one can rewrite the ordinary differential equation resulting from the ncwdw equation as [ eq2.7 ] -12d^2dx^2 + 24(6e^-2x_0-^2)(x - x_0)^2+[24 e^-2x_0 - 1 2(x_0-c)^2]=0  .    comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq2.7 ] ) with the schrdinger equation of the harmonic oscillator we can clearly identify the potential and the energy of the system .",
    "thus , the noncommutative potential required to compute the partition function is [ eq2.8 ] v_nc(y)=24(6e^-2x_0-^2)y^2  , where we have defined a new variable @xmath32 .",
    "the feynman - hibbs procedure allows for introducing quantum corrections to the partition function through the potential , i.e. one can admit a quantum correction for the potential given by @xcite , [ eq2.9 ] _",
    "bh24v_nc(y)=2_bh(6e^-2x_0-^2 )  , where @xmath33 is the inverse of the bh temperature .",
    "the noncommutative potential with the corresponding quantum corrections then reads , [ eq2.10 ] u_nc(y)=24(6e^-2x_0-^2)(y^2+_bh12 )  .",
    "finally , the noncommutative partition function is given by [ eq2.11 ] z_nc=  .",
    "we are now in conditions to compute the thermodynamic quantities of the schwarzschild bh .",
    "starting from the noncommutative internal energy of the bh , @xmath34 , [ eq2.12 ] |e_nc=1_bh+4(6e^-2x_0-^2)_bh  , the equality @xmath35 , allows for obtaining an expression for the bh temperature : [ eq2.13 ] _ bh = m8(6e^-2x_0-^2 )  . inverting this quantity ,",
    "one obtains the bh temperature .",
    "dropping the term proportional to @xmath36 , as presumably @xmath37 , and considering the positive root , we obtain : [ eq2.13a ] t_bh=4 m(6e^-2x_0-^2 )  . notice that this quantity is positive ( cf .",
    "( [ eq2.5a ] ) ) . to compare this result with the hawking temperature @xmath38",
    ", we should be cautious as the limit @xmath39 is ill - defined .",
    "indeed , our whole construction rests on the premise that we have a stable local minimum of the potential .",
    "however , this is only true provided @xmath40 .",
    "we remark that our expression displays the same mass dependence as the hawking temperature , and we write it as [ eq2.13.1a ] t_bh = b()m  , where @xmath41 is a @xmath42 dependent constant : [ eq2.13.1b ] b ( ) = 4 ( 6e^-2x_0-^2 )  .",
    "moreover , a simple numerical calculation reveals that we may recover the hawking temperature even in the presence of the momentum noncommutativity for a specific value of @xmath0 . indeed , equating eq .",
    "( [ eq2.13a ] ) with the hawking temperature and using the stationarity condition ( [ eq2.5 ] ) , we obtain for @xmath43 [ eq2.13.1c ] x_0=1.8478 = 0.025  . and thus , since @xmath0 can not be exactly equal to zero , we can regard @xmath44 as a reference value which yields the hawking temperature , and as @xmath0 increases we get a gradual noncommutative deformation of the hawking temperature .",
    "the entropy is calculated using the definition , @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the entropy for the phase - space noncommutative bh is given by : [ eq2.14 ] s_bh&=&+m^2(1+)+ + & -&m^2(1+)^2 + + & -&(1 + )  . neglecting as before terms proportional to @xmath36 , as @xmath37 , we finally obtain [ eq2.16 ] s_bh+  .",
    "for the reference value @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 .",
    "we then recover the hawking entropy , but also some `` stringy '' corrections s_bh=4m^2 + -(8 m )  .",
    "[ eq2.16a ] in summary , as in the case of the temperature , we obtain that the noncommutative entropy of the bh is the hawking entropy plus additional contributions and some noncommutative corrections",
    ".    as can be clearly seen , the relevant thermodynamic quantities are corrections of the schwarzschild bh ones that depend explicitly on the momentum noncommutative parameter @xmath0 through @xmath48 . if @xmath49 , the hawking temperature and entropy for the black hole are recovered . on the contrary , by inspection , if @xmath50 , the potential eq .",
    "( [ eq2.1 ] ) reduces to a monotonous exponential term with no local minima .",
    "it is only if @xmath51 that the potential function acquires a quadratic term .",
    "this in turn ensures that the potential function has a local minimum and a local maximum .",
    "it is around the minimum of the potential that the calculations of quantum corrections can be carried out .",
    "thus , the feynman - hibbs procedure is meaningful only in the presence of the momentum noncommutativity .",
    "in this section , we use eq .",
    "( [ eq1.11 ] ) to extract some information about the essential @xmath52 singularity .",
    "it should be noticed that in order to employ the ks metric to describe the interior of the schwarzschild black hole the identification ( [ eq0.3 ] ) has to be imposed .",
    "thus , we can see that for @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we are thus interested in studying the limit [ eq3.1.1 ] _ _ c,_c + ( _ c,_c )  , where @xmath56 is a generic solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq1.11 ] ) .",
    "we seek for a representation of solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq1.11 ] ) in terms of the eigenstates of @xmath57 eq .",
    "( [ eq1.12 ] ) [ eq3.1.2 ] ( _ c,_c)= da c(a ) _",
    "a(_c,_c ) where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is of the form [ eq3.1.3 ] _",
    "a(_c,_c)=_a ( _ c ) and @xmath60 , @xmath61 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq1.13 ] ) . in the limit @xmath62 ,",
    "if we keep only the dominant terms , eq.([eq1.13 ] ) reads : [ eq3.2 ] _ a(z)+(z - a)^2_a(z)=0  .",
    "this equation can be rewritten for @xmath51 as [ eq3.3 ] \\{-^2z^2-^2 z^2 } _",
    "a(z)=0  . where the change of variables has been performed @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "( [ eq3.3 ] ) is analogous to the eigenvalue equation for an inverted harmonic oscillator .",
    "this hamiltonian is self - adjoint in @xmath65 , its spectrum is continuous and its zero eigenfunction ( the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq3.3 ] ) ) displays the asymptotic form @xcite ( for @xmath66 ) , [ eq3.4 ] _",
    "a(z)~1z^1/2and so , for all @xmath67 , [ eq3.5 ] _ z + _",
    "a(z ) = _ z + _ a(z - a)=0 _ _ c,_c + _ a(_c,_c)=0  .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to expect that , for a suitable , although fairly general choice of the coefficients @xmath68 [ eq3.6 ] _ _ c,_c + ( _ c,_c)=0  , which is a necessary condition to provide a quantum regularization of the classical singularity of the schwarzschild bh .",
    "however , one should be cautious before running into the conclusion that the probability of finding the bh at the singularity is zero .",
    "first of all the calculation of probabilities for general covariant systems is a subtle issue . in our case ,",
    "given that the wave function is oscillatory in @xmath69 , it seems natural to fix a @xmath69-hypersurface , corresponding to the introduction of the measure @xmath70 in the probability distributions .",
    "the probability @xmath71 of finding the bh at the singularity would then be given by the expression : [ eq3.7 ] p(r=0,t=0)= _ _ c,_c + _ _ c^+|(_c,_c)|^2 d _",
    "c__c + _ _ c^+|_a(_c)|^2d_c which , unfortunately , is divergent .",
    "this follows from the conclusion ( which can be derived from the asymptotic expression ) that the inverted harmonic oscillator displays non - normalizable eigenstates @xcite .",
    "hence , the noncommutativity of the form ( [ eq1.8.1 ] ) can not be regarded as the final answer for the singularity problem of the schwarzschild bh .    however , it is quite interesting to realize that an hamiltonian @xmath72 with the asymptotic form [ eq3.8 ] h= -^2x^2 + v(x ) , v(x ) ~-^2 x^2 + 2 for some @xmath73 , displays zero energy eigenstates of the kind @xcite [ eq3.9 ] ( x ) ~1x^(1+)/2  , which are normalizable .",
    "one may then speculate that a suitable perturbation of the noncommutative structure ( [ eq1.8.1 ] ) may lead to a ncwdw equation associated to a potential of the form @xmath74 for some arbitrarily small @xmath73 .",
    "the solutions of this new ncwdw equation would then display zero probability ( in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ eq3.7 ] ) ) at the singularity , thus solving this problem for the schwarzschild bh @xcite .",
    "in this work , the ncwdw equation for a ks cosmological model was used to study the thermodynamic properties of the schwarzschild bh and to obtain information about the structure of the singularity at @xmath1 . working out the ncwdw equation we implemented the feynman - hibbs procedure identifying the quadratic part of the minisuperspace potential .",
    "this allows for obtaining the partition function and hence the bh thermodynamic quantities .",
    "as we have shown , this is possible for a noncommutative bh only if noncommutativity in the momentum space is introduced .",
    "the essential singularity @xmath52 is studied with the help of the ncwdw equation . in the limit of @xmath53 , or @xmath75 ,",
    "one arrives at the schrdinger problem of the inverted harmonic oscillator , whose wave function vanishes at the limit @xmath75 , but is not square integrable .",
    "therefore , it is not possible conclude that the singularity problem is solved by the considered momentum noncommutativity .",
    "nevertheless , we can foresee that a noncanonical form of phase - space noncommutativity may allow for a square integrable wave function .",
    "this possibility will be analysed elsewhere @xcite .",
