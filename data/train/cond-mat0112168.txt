    "as revealed by the increasing number of recent papers @xcite-@xcite , the quantum counterpart or the quantization of classical discrete breathers ( cdbs ) has become these very last years a real challenging and exciting field . at present , indeed , the theory of cdbs , i.e. `` time - periodic spatially localized motions in networks of oscillators ( mackay @xcite ) '' , has reached a high degree of perfection and may certainly be considered as a real achievement .",
    "as it is well known , the necessary condition required for a hamiltonian lattice to support such cdbs is that the breather frequency as well as its harmonics do not lie inside the phonon band .",
    "such a non resonance condition may be achieved by the interplay of discreteness and nonlinearity , the first providing a natural upper bound of the linearized hamiltonian spectrum ( say phonons ) whereas the latter allowing for a tuning of frequencies out of this spectrum @xcite .",
    "mathematical existence proofs of cdbs have been obtained for a wide variety of model hamiltonians @xcite and have simultaneously given rise to an accurate numerical method allowing for their practical construction @xcite . both are based on the so - called _ anti - continuous _",
    "limit ( i.e. the limit where the coupling between oscillators vanishes ) , provided a nonlinear onsite potential is present . in this limit",
    "time - periodic spatially localized ( on one or more sites ) solutions trivially exist .",
    "more recently , an existence proof of cdbs based on a discrete version of the center manifold reduction has also been given for the fpu chain for which the method based on the anti - continuous limit fails @xcite .",
    "this completes and enlarges the results previously obtained in @xcite by a homoclinic orbit approach . at last , also recently , a variational approach has been carried out to prove the existence of hard discrete breathers in some classes of hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "obviously , the wide range of applications of these rigorous mathematical results supports the idea that cdbs are generic solutions of nonlinear hamiltonian lattices as claimed for the first time by sievers and takeno in 1988 when they discovered this new kind of intrinsic localized modes @xcite .",
    "together with their existence proofs , the properties of cdbs have been extensively studied .",
    "it has been shown for example that they are structurally stable provided the non resonance condition holds @xcite and linearly stable in any dimension provided the coupling is weak enough @xcite .",
    "their spatial decay is generally exponential ( for any finite range interaction potential ) but may be also algebraic in case the interaction potential itself is algebraically decaying @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has even been confirmed that a pure nonlinearity of the interaction potential may give rise to a super - exponential decay of the breather tail @xcite . at",
    "last , and directly related to their spatial decay properties , possible energy thresholds for their appearance have been derived according to whether the lattice dimension exceeds a system - dependent critical value or not @xcite .",
    "extensive studies of cdbs properties as well as the perspectives in this field may be found in different reviews ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the general properties of cdbs briefly listed above shows how well their theory is understood at present .",
    "much less is known on the other hand about their quantum counterparts ( qdbs ) , that is , about the quantum states which would behave similarly to cdbs in a sense to be clarified below",
    ". nevertheless , this question is of great importance given one natural area of application , namely , the condensed matter physics where quantum effects have generally to be considered ( see @xcite and refs . therein for a review of the materials where the presence of dbs is suspected , expected or has been detected ) .",
    "this is the precise reason why the quantum theory of breathers is currently in full development .",
    "let us turn back to an essential property of cdbs .",
    "these time - periodic solutions occur in a lattice but are spatially localized which means that they are not invariant under the discrete translational symmetry of the lattice whereas the hamiltonian does .",
    "if we now consider the corresponding quantum problem , the invariance of the quantum hamiltonian @xmath0 with respect to the discrete translational symmetry ( the operator of which we denote by @xmath1 ) yields @xmath2=0 $ ] .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath1 are thus eigenstates of @xmath0 and are delocalized along the lattice ( bloch waves ) .",
    "of course , this discrete translational symmetry of the lattice is broken if we consider for instance a finite system with fixed or open boundary conditions .",
    "nevertheless , if the lattice consists of a sufficiently large number of sites , discrete translational symmetry is practically restored similar to the infinite lattice . however , at large enough energy the quantum and the classical descriptions of the system should give similar results !",
    "it is possible to reconcile the quantum and the classical points of view provided we again start from the anti - continuous limit . in this limit indeed , the hamiltonian consists only of a sum of identical hamiltonians ( one for each site ) @xmath3 and a general eigenstate @xmath4 of the system may be represented as the tensorial product of local eigenstates @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "then , a localized excitation is obviously constructed by creating an excitation of level @xmath7 at site @xmath8 , @xmath9 whereas the other sites reside in their ground state @xmath10 .",
    "this leads to @xmath11 .",
    "this case corrresponds to the classical one used to initialize the construction algorithm of a cdb at non zero coupling",
    ". nevertheless , any eigenstate of the form @xmath12 has the same energy .",
    "the corresponding eigen - subspace has a dimension @xmath13 equal to the number of sites ( provided no additional accidental degeneracy occurs ) .",
    "therefore in the uncoupled ( anti - continuous ) limit , any unitary transform of the preceeding basis leaves the subspace invariant although it yields a new basis .",
    "as the hamiltonian system is invariant under the discrete translation @xmath1 whatever the intersite coupling @xmath14 is , at non zero coupling , the eigenstates of @xmath0 must belong to one of the @xmath13 symmetry sectors defined by @xmath1 .",
    "when the coupling becomes zero , we may thus choose the eigenbasis of @xmath1 as a basis of the @xmath13-dimensional subspace .",
    "we denote its eigenvectors by @xmath15 where @xmath16 labels the symmetry sector . of course",
    "each of these new eigenstates is completely delocalized ( in the sense that latexmath:[$\\forall q,\\ [ \\sum_j     let us assume now that we switch on the coupling between the sites .",
    "we expect the @xmath13-fold degenerated eigenenergy to be splitted under the effect of the perturbation and to form a band of @xmath13 nearly degenerated eigenenergies .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates , which already had the correct symmetry because of the unitary transform @xmath1 performed on the local basis at @xmath18 , now give a new ( perturbed ) basis @xmath19 .",
    "provided @xmath14 is weak enough , these new eigenvectors are close to those defined at the uncoupled limit and thus an inverse unitary transform @xmath20 is expected to yield a basis @xmath21 close to the local basis of the uncoupled limit , that is , @xmath22 .",
    "these states are thus well localized provided the coupling is weak enough . however , being a linear combination of non degenerated eigenstates , they are no more eigenstates of @xmath0 and evolve in time .",
    "this tunneling effect , corresponding to the transfer of an initial excitation from site to site , takes a time typically given by the width of the band at a given value of the coupling @xmath14 . in order to gap the bridge between the classical manifestation of the breather solution and its quantum realization ,",
    "we thus expect the quantum system to exhibit bands of @xmath13 nearly degenerated eigenstates whose width tends to zero as the average energy of the band goes to infinity .",
    "the purpose of a quantum theory of breathers is thus to know how the above defined bands behave as the coupling increases .",
    "several successful attempts to answer this question have already been done in one - dimensional systems which present the particularity to be integrable ( @xcite , @xcite-@xcite and the review @xcite ) .",
    "the ( soliton / breather ) bandwidth is shown to behave typically like @xmath23 where @xmath8 is strictly speaking the number of bosons in the system .",
    "this number corresponds to the number of the excited level of a single site in the absence of interaction @xmath24 and typically depends on energy as a power law .",
    "finally @xmath25 is a measure of the onsite ( quartic ) nonlinearity .",
    "it is then obvious that for bands of high energy ( @xmath26 ) , the bandwidth goes rapidly ( in fact more than exponentially fast ) to zero with increasing @xmath8 . in this case",
    "the tunneling time goes to infinity in the classical limit and the quantum breather ( quasi - classical ) state remains localized on its initial site .",
    "several questions remain however . at high energy ,",
    "if the onsite potential behaves like @xmath27 , the density of states ( evaluated at @xmath28 by the mean of the weyl s formula ) scales like @xmath29 as @xmath30 , where @xmath13 is the number of sites .",
    "an immediate conclusion is that if the number of sites is greater or equal to 2 , the density of states ( dos ) increases with energy according to a power law with exponents linearly depending on @xmath13 .",
    "then , we may ask whether the corresponding raise of interaction possibilities ( hybridization ) will destroy the quantum breather bands or not . a partial answer to this question",
    "should be given by the ratio of the breather bandwidth and the mean level spacing @xmath31 at a given ( high ) energy @xmath32 : @xmath33 ?",
    "assuming that the dos scales as indicated by the weyl s formula , the ratio of the bandwidth to the mean level spacing will tend to zero provided the bandwidth decreases exponentially with increasing energy ( or faster ) .",
    "the above mentioned integrable examples fall into this category .",
    "this result seems to indicate and to explain the possibility , starting from the quantum problem , to recover the limit of the classical breather at high energy .",
    "another natural question is related to the impact of the nonintegrability of the system on the quantum breather bands and in particular the influence at the quantum level of the chaotic trajectories induced by the nonintegrability lying nearby the classical breathers .    up to now , except for integrable systems , where analytical results are obtainable ,",
    "studies of quantum breathers have been done numerically .",
    "such studies become rapidly extremely difficult due to the huge matrices to be diagonalized and so far have been restricted to small 1d systems for which the number of sites has not exceeded @xmath34 @xcite . even for these moderate lattice sizes ,",
    "the average dimension of the ( truncated ) hamiltonian matrices is generally of order @xmath35 and requires specific numerical diagonalization methods @xcite .",
    "the numerical results reported in the papers mentioned above are restricted to the low energy sector as soon as the number of sites exceeds a few units .",
    "this is easily understood given the number of configurations obtainable by truncating the basis to @xmath36 bosons per sites on @xmath13 sites ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "remains the possibility to study very small systems ( @xmath38 or @xmath39 ) , as it has already been done for the dimer ( integrable ) @xcite and the trimer ( non integrable ) @xcite .",
    "the dimer has also been used to describe the tunneling of a qb along a chain by a suitable linearization of the lattice around it @xcite .",
    "this linearization method was also employed to study the properties of classical rotobreathers in a chain of pendula @xcite .",
    "but the specific properties of quantum rotobreathers have not been discussed yet .",
    "we will consider a dimer of two coupled quantum pendula which , due to the presence of both nonlinear onsite and interaction potentials , is not integrable .",
    "as far as we know , no experimental study of quantum rotobreathers has been done yet .",
    "this is possibly due to their quite large activation energy .",
    "the reader should notice however that a large number of studies have been devoted to the rotational motions of molecules ( see e.g. @xcite ) especially concerning the methyl groups whose dynamical properties are usually obtained via neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "but the transitions thus obtained concern the so - called quantum rotational tunneling effect @xcite .",
    "this tunneling occurs between the equilibrium positions defined by the onsite potential which is @xmath8-fold according to the individual symmetry of the observed molecule and the symmetry of its environment .",
    "for the methyl groups @xmath8 is generally equal to 3 but for ammonia in hofmann clathrates , the fourfold symmetry of the host crystal induces an approximative 12-fold @xcite or more complex @xcite symmetry .",
    "this tunneling is thus responsible for a rotation of the molecule forbidden in the classical case .",
    "the quantum rotobreather on an other hand is a state whose energy is situated _ above _ the energy of the separatrix .",
    "a tunneling effect appears , because of the coupling between molecules , which consists in the transfer of the excitation from site ( molecule ) to site .",
    "a study of the properties of the 4-methyl - pyridine by fillaux and co - workers has revealed the presence of a quantum sine - gordon breather in this compound @xcite .",
    "the properties of this state , shown to be the ground state of the system , are theoretically analyzed via a semiclassical quantization procedure of the classical solution of the sine - gordon equation and then successfully compared to experimental results .",
    "however , the coupling between adjacent methyl groups is so strong along certain axes of the crystal ( chains ) that the relative phases on neighbouring groups are small .",
    "that allows to use the continuum sine - gordon theory . in the case of a rotobreather ,",
    "such an approximation becomes of course impossible due to the unavoidable large phase difference created at the interface between the rotating and oscillating groups .",
    "the study of the properties of rotobreathers ( either classical or quantum ) thus requires to preserve the rotational invariance of the interaction potential .",
    "our system under study consists of two pendula coupled by a cosine interaction potential ( which preserves the rotational invariance ) . to simplify the study ,",
    "the onsite and interaction potentials are the same functions and are 1-fold .",
    "this avoids to deal with the nearly degeneracies coming from the @xmath8 different arches of a @xmath40 potential at low energies ( typically below the separatrix ) .",
    "notice that this does not change essentially the high energy part of the single site spectrum ( which tends to the free rotor one whatever the value of @xmath8 ) but removes the splittings of the doublets which are not coming from the center ( @xmath41 ) or the edge ( @xmath42 ) of the corresponding brillouin zone @xmath43 .",
    "the results we will obtain in section 2 concerning the upper part ( above the separatrix energy ) of the spectrum are thus easy to adapt to the case of an @xmath8-fold onsite potential .",
    "notice at last that despite its very short size , our `` pendula dimer '' still possesses the discrete translational invariance @xmath1 which corresponds to the permutation symmetry .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we briefly review the properties of a single quantum pendulum and we derive important formulas concerning the splitting occurring in the doublets in the high energy sector . in section 3 ,",
    "we start by presenting some results of the classical problem corresponding to two coupled pendula .",
    "then we show how to compute the quantum spectrum of this system .",
    "we derive the exact spectrum at the uncoupled limit and we construct a quantum rotobreather according to the method presented in the introduction . by increasing the coupling between the pendula , we follow the quantum rotobreather ( qr ) and we compute the splittings occurring in the corresponding quadruplet .",
    "in this section we briefly review some of the properties of the classical and quantum one pendulum problem ( for more details see for instance @xcite ) . in the quantum case ,",
    "we particularly focus on quasi - degenerated states and their energy splitting .",
    "we show by two different methods that it is possible to compute this splitting exactly in leading order .",
    "the hamiltonian of the pendulum system is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath36 represent respectively the angle variable and the associated momentum .",
    "@xmath46 tunes the barrier height of the onsite potential .      from ( [ hp1 ] )",
    "we deduce the classical equation of motion @xmath47 which possesses two different solutions . denoting by @xmath32 the energy of the pendulum and by @xmath48 the energy of the separatrix separating the oscillatory motion from the rotational one we get :    * oscillation : @xmath49 @xmath50 where the modulus of the jacobian elliptic function @xmath51 is defined by the relation @xmath52 and the period of the oscillation is @xmath53 , @xmath54 being the complete elliptic integral of the first kind @xcite ; * rotation : @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 and where the rotation period is @xmath58 .",
    "surprisingly , while the classical problem of the pendulum is a very basic one , it seems that a thorough study of the related quantum problem has been done quite recently ( r. aldrovandi and p. leal ferreira @xcite ) .",
    "our purpose here is not to repeat the analysis done in the paper cited above but rather to insist on the momentum reversal symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ hp1 ] ) which leads to the appearance of pairs of quasi - degenerated states above the separatrix .",
    "the stationary schrdinger equation corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ hp1 ] ) is given by @xmath59 @xmath60 is the wave function of the pendulum and @xmath32 its energy . as the wave function of the pendulum has to be single - valued ( @xcite,@xcite ) , we impose the periodicity condition @xmath61 it is possible to get an analytical solution of ( [ schr1 ] ) by performing the following change of variables : @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we immediately obtain the canonical form of the mathieu equation ( @xcite ) @xmath64 where @xmath65 because of the previous change of variables , @xmath66 is now a @xmath67-periodic function .",
    "it can be shown ( @xcite ) that the mathieu equation supports @xmath67-periodic solutions if and only if the characteristic value @xmath68 belongs to an infinite countable set of values denoted by @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 is related to the _ even _ mathieu function @xmath71 whereas @xmath72 is related to the _ odd _ mathieu function @xmath73 . as follows from their definition ( [ defqa ] ) ,",
    "@xmath16 is directly related to the energy of the separatrix @xmath74 that is to the depth of the cosine potential appearing in the schrdinger equation whereas , up to a scaling and a shift factor , @xmath68 represents the eigenenergies of the pendulum hamiltonian . for a given value of @xmath16 ( that is of @xmath75 ) ,",
    "the series @xmath76 increases monotonically with @xmath8 keeping the property @xmath77 .",
    "for @xmath78 the only possible solution is an even function @xmath79 which represents the ground state of the system .",
    "according to the previous results , the analytical solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ schr1 ] ) reads @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath78 which represents the ground state of the pendulum hamiltonian .      according to the periodicity condition ( [ percond1 ] ) imposed to the wave function",
    ", it is rather natural to consider its fourier expansion : @xmath83 where @xmath84 because of the periodicity of the wave function , the fourier space associated to the pendulum problem is infinite but discrete . in the fr ,",
    "the stationary schrdinger equation becomes @xmath85 where for later convenience we have redefined the energy as @xmath86    equation ( [ schfour ] ) represents a tight - binding equation whose hopping terms and onsite potential would be respectively @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in this equation , the sum @xmath89 related to the cosine potential plays now the role of a discrete laplacian while the onsite `` potential '' term @xmath88 comes from the kinetic energy .",
    "thus , in fr , the terms of the schrdinger equation have inverted their role .",
    "this fact is important in understanding how the discrete wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( dwkb ) method ( @xcite,@xcite ) applies to the mathieu equation ( see section [ sectdwkb ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ schfour ] ) is invariant under the transformation ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "this symmetry operation corresponds to the inversion of the momentum of the system ( @xmath91 ) which originates in the time reversal symmetry of the original problem .",
    "this allows us to separate the eigenstates of ( [ schfour ] ) into symmetric @xmath92 and antisymmetric @xmath93 states .",
    "we may write the hamiltonian of ( [ schfour ] ) as @xmath94 where we have used the ket notation @xmath95 to represent the plane wave function @xmath96 .",
    "the matrix representing @xmath97 in the fr is infinite , tridiagonal and symmetric .",
    "its diagonal elements are @xmath88 and the off - diagonal elements are constant and equal to @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , @xmath98 .",
    "this additional `` central '' symmetry is a direct consequence of the time reversal symmetry and the hermitian properties of @xmath97 .      without any onsite potential ( @xmath99 )",
    ", it follows from ( [ hfour1 ] ) that @xmath95 and @xmath100 are eigenstates of @xmath97 with identical energy @xmath88 .",
    "consequently , each state except the ground state @xmath101 is two - fold degenerated in this limit .",
    "this two - fold degeneracy is due to the two equivalent possible motions consisting in rotating in a given sense or its opposite .",
    "the switching on of an onsite potential governed by the parameter @xmath75 lifts this degeneracy but in a way depending on the energy level of the state under consideration .",
    "indeed , when @xmath75 becomes nonzero , the pendulum system admits a new kind of motion , namely , the oscillating motion which corresponds to the motion in the cosine arch of the potential well in the classical system ( see fig . [ elalp5e1 ] ) .",
    "the quantum system also admits such kind of states but their number is limited by the value of @xmath75 because of the quantization rules .",
    "as @xmath75 becomes larger , the number of states below the separatrix increases and can be estimated to @xmath102 by using the weyl formula ( see below ( [ neopp ] ) in the limit @xmath103 ) .",
    "if the value of @xmath75 is large enough it becomes possible to look at the properties of the low energy states by expanding the cosine potential around zero in a series of powers of @xmath45 .",
    "we obtain @xmath104    the first order of this expansion leads to the harmonic approximation of ( [ hp1 ] ) whose frequency is given by @xmath105 .",
    "thus , low energy states of the quantum pendulum are well represented by the corresponding low energy harmonic eigenstates ( at least for large enough values of @xmath75 ) . as the level spacing of the harmonic oscillator is constant ( and equal to @xmath106 )",
    "we expect the states to be quite regularly spaced deep inside the well .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ elalp5e1 ] which represents the lower part of the spectrum of a pendulum whose parameter @xmath107 .",
    "the energy levels of @xmath92 and @xmath93 states have been respectively represented to the right and to the left .",
    "we clearly see that the few first states are quite regularly spaced while they condensate in reaching energies close to the separatrix . by using standard second order perturbation theory within the natural harmonic basis ,",
    "we may obtain the first corrections to the pure harmonic spectrum .",
    "this perturbation in the nonlinear terms gives @xmath108 where @xmath8 labels the states ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "of course , this expression ceases to be valid when nonlinear corrections become large as compared to the harmonic term .",
    "nevertheless , it shows how the spacing becomes smaller as the energy increases but remains below the energy of the separatrix : @xmath110    .",
    "states have been distinguished according to their parity . only a few states lying above the separatrix have been displayed .",
    "the number @xmath8 of the corresponding doublet is written on top of it .",

    "[ elalp5e1 ] shows that symmetric and antisymmetric states glue together to form pairs of nearly degenerated states . from a physical point of view",
    "this phenomenon is due to the fact that far above from the separatrix the cosine potential appears like a perturbation of the free rotor and only shifts the levels a bit around their value @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) . because of the momentum reversal symmetry",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ hfour1 ] ) diagonalizes into two blocks each related respectively to @xmath92 or @xmath93 states . in the fr ,",
    "the corresponding reduced matrices are still tridiagonal . by applying standard perturbation theory in the parameter @xmath75 to one of these matrices",
    "whose spectrum is now free of nearly degenerated eigenvalues , we obtain corrections to the free rotor energy @xmath113 .",
    "to second order , we find @xmath114 explicit corrections up to @xmath115 are obtainable ( see @xcite p. 724 ) .",
    "as we mentioned , this energy is the mean energy of a doublet .",
    "this is indicated by the subscript @xmath116 in ( [ endoub ] ) .",
    "it is also possible to calculate explicitely the splitting between the symmetric and antisymmetric states of a doublet labeled by @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the inverse of this splitting is a direct measure of the time required by a rotating state to invert its initial momentum .",
    "it has to be noticed that by `` rotating state '' we mean the superposition of the states @xmath92 and @xmath93 belonging to the same doublet .",
    "because of their symmetry , the expectation value of the momentum for @xmath92 and @xmath93 are zero .    a possible way to get",
    "this splitting is to use high order perturbation theory as it has already been done in @xcite ( equation ( 12 ) ) .",
    "a proof of this formula has been derived in @xcite and applied to the quantum discrete self - trapping equation .",
    "the special `` centro - symmetric '' form of the tridiagonal hamiltonian matrix in the fr allows us to compute the exact leading order of the splitting as    @xmath119    notice that due to the obvious relation between the eigenfunctions of the spp and the mathieu functions , the splitting @xmath120 gives in turn the result of the splitting between the characteristic values associated to the symmetric and antisymmetric @xmath67-periodic mathieu functions @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "a similar computation allows us to obtain the splitting for the @xmath123-periodic mathieu functions . by using the notations of @xcite",

    "moreover , it can be verified to be correct by using the small @xmath16 expansions of the low order characteristic values themselves .    as @xmath8 , which represents",
    "the label of the doublet , becomes large enough , we find the following asymptotic form for the splitting @xmath127 indicating that it decays more than exponentially fast as @xmath8 increases . moreover this expression contains its limit of validity as the number @xmath8 has to be greater than the critical value @xmath128 to ensure that the splitting is small ( see comment , @xmath129 ( see ( [ neopp ] ) in the limit @xmath130 ) .",
    "the number of ( nondegenerated ) pairs of symmetric and antisymmetric eigenstates below the separatrix is thus @xmath131 which is very similar to @xmath132 as @xmath133 . as @xmath134 it proves that expression ( [ den ] )",

    "this distribution is then superposed to the corresponding poincar section of the classical system which allows to compute the overlap .",
    "this method has for instance been used in the case of a driven bistable system @xcite . at the same time these studies have shown that doublet states overlapping up to 70% with the chaotic layer may still possess a small splitting . to avoid misinterpretations , here we will compare the fourier components of the quantum rotobreather @xmath257 , with the poincar section of the classical system in the momenta space .",
    "the main result will be that the phase space locations of the classical and the quantum rotobreathers are roughly the same .",

    "finally , when the coupling parameter becomes larger than 5 , the splittings corresponding to the transfer of the excitation between the pendula start to be of the same order as the mean spacing in the spectrum ( @xmath384 here as shown in ( [ netilde ] ) ) .",

    "we follow the resulting evolution of the quadruplet and monitor the different splittings .",
    "each of them can be shown to be associated to a given tunneling process according to the involved states .",
    "in general , we have seen that two processes have to be distinguished .",
    "the first concerns the tunneling ( or transfer ) of the initial excitation ( energy ) between the pendula which corresponds to a tunneling of the quantum rotobreather @xmath257 between neighboring sites .",
    "this tunneling effect is associated to the permutation symmetry present in the system .",
    "the second tunneling effect relies on another symmetry due to the invariance of the system to a reversal of its total momentum .",
    "this symmetry already appears in the single pendulum problem where it is responsible for the occurrence of doublets of nearly degenerated states at sufficiently high energy ( above the separatrix ) .",
    "this second tunneling effect takes a time which is orders of magnitude larger than the time of the excitation transfer between pendula ( except for very small coupling values ) .",
    "by progressively increasing the pendula coupling , we have shown that the quadruplet under investigation may survive crossings ( or avoided crossings ) with other states . nevertheless , for large enough coupling , the nearly degenerated states of different permutation symmetry parities separate sufficiently from each other , leading to splittings of order of the mean level spacing in the spectrum .",
    "this situation corresponds classically to a large chaotization of the phase space at the considered energy level and thus to a strong overlap of the quantum state with the chaotic layer surrounding the quasi - regular island where the classical rotobreather is located .",
    "the disappearance of the quantum rotobreather can be interepreted by the fact that the corresponding state is no more able to keep the excitation in a given pendulum for a long time as compared to the typical oscillation time of the system .    to conclude this paper",
    ", we would like to comment on the relation between the classical and the quantum ( roto)breathers .",
    "an essential ingredient for the existence of a quantum breather is the appearance of bands of nearly degenerated eigenstates whose bandwith remain very small as the coupling increases .",
    "nevertheless , the general method employed to construct the quantum breather by starting from the anti - continuous limit may be used as well for a chain of @xmath13 purely harmonic oscillators ( with a harmonic coupling ) . as",
    "this chain can not possess any kind of classical breathers , what prevents quantum breathers from existing on such a chain ? to answer this question , we compute the bandwith corresponding to a local excitation of @xmath8 bosons close to the anti - continuous limit . we obtain @xmath391 , @xmath106 being the oscillator frequency and @xmath14 the coupling .",
    "this shows that the bandwith becomes large as the mean energy of the band @xmath392 does .",
    "moreover , the density of states scales like @xmath393 ( see the introduction ) and the product @xmath394 as @xmath395 .",
    "this shows that like the classical harmonic chain , the quantum system can not support quantum breathers .    a second comment concerns the `` classical - like '' behavior of the quantum breather .",
    "by defining the latter as a superposition of the eigenstates making up a single band , its time evolution is de facto restricted to these states .",
    "the fine structure of the band thus provides the only available frequencies of this evolution .",
    "as the corresponding splittings are very small , none of them is related to the classical breather frequency .",
    "these frequencies only concern the tunneling of the excitation from site to site . on the other hand ,",
    "the individual energies of particles making up a classical breather , for example , oscillate around their mean value at the breather frequency .",
    "where does such a frequency appear in the quantum system ?",
    "it turns out that this frequency is naturally recovered by considering quantum states which display an excitation similar to the quantum breather but which are not restricted to a single band .",
    "we have verified in our system that a coherent state parametrized by the average phases and momenta of the quantum rotobreather @xmath257 excites mainly the quadruplets separated by an energy difference which corresponds approximately to the classical rotobreather frequency .",
    "the interaction between quadruplets is thus responsible for the `` classical - like '' time behavior of averaged observables ( like individual energies ) .",
    "this should generalize to nonlinear systems with more than two degrees of freedom where we expect interactions between bands to play a similar role as the interaction between quadruplets in our system .",
    "in this appendix , we solve the problem of two coupled rotors , i.e. the limit of the two coupled pendula when the onsite parameter @xmath75 is equal to zero . in this case , the system defined by the hamiltonian ( [ h2pend ] ) is integrable . indeed ,",
