    "weak gravitational lensing by large - scale structure @xcite is becoming a central means of constraining our cosmological model ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the current status ) .",
    "continuing effort has yielded increasingly stringent control of systematic errors and ever larger surveys are decreasing the statistical errors rapidly . as the precision with which the measurements are made increases , one demands ever higher fidelity in the data - analysis , modeling and theoretical interpretation .",
    "one such area is the computation of the theoretical predictions for various statistics involving the measurable ` reduced shear ' @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the ` plain ' shear and @xmath2 is the convergence which is related to the projected mass along the line of sight .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath1 are defined through the jacobian of the mapping between the source and image planes . if the lensing is weak then @xmath3 , and to lowest order @xmath4 and the power spectra of the shear and convergence are equal : @xmath5 .",
    "thus measurements are usually compared to predictions of @xmath6 derived from models of the non - linear clustering of matter .",
    "this relation has corrections however , which need to be taken into account if precise comparisons with data are to be made in the future .",
    "while there has been previous analytic work on this subject @xcite and some numerical work on magnification statistics @xcite , there has been no comprehensive investigation of this effect in simulations . in this short paper",
    "we present some results , derived from simulations similar to those described in @xcite , on the size of the corrections for a variety of commonly used statistics on the angular scales where most current lensing work has focused .",
    "the results are derived from 7 n - body simulations of a @xmath7cdm cosmology run with the treepm code @xcite .",
    "each simulation employed @xmath8 equal mass dark matter particles in a periodic cubical box of side @xmath9mpc run to @xmath10 with phase space data dumped every @xmath11mpc starting at @xmath12 .",
    "the cosmology was the same for each simulation ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) but different random number seeds were used to generate the initial conditions .",
    "the purpose of these runs was to allow a study of the statistical distributions of lensing observables .",
    "each box was used to generate 16 approximately independent lensing maps , each @xmath18 , using the multi - plane ray - tracing code described in @xcite .",
    "each map was produced with @xmath19 pixels and then downsampled to @xmath20 pixels pixels indicate that our results are converged at the several percent level in the ratios that we quote , with better agreement at larger scales as expected . ] .",
    "thus a total of 112 maps or @xmath21 square degrees were simulated , all with the same cosmology .",
    "we report on the results for sources at @xmath22 ( specifically all at a comoving distance of @xmath23mpc ) here .",
    "other data can be obtained from http://mwhite.berkeley.edu/lensing .",
    "the lowest order information on large - scale structure comes from studying the 2-point statistics of the shear field .",
    "a number of different 2-point statistics have been used in the literature , each with their own strengths and weaknesses .",
    "we survey the most commonly used statistics here .",
    "we first show the results on the variance of the shear , smoothed on a range of angular scales .",
    "though it has numerous drawbacks in interpretation , this was one of the first statistics computed from shear maps due to its ease of computation .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : svar ] shows the ( reduced ) shear variance as a function of smoothing scale .",
    "for each point we compute a map of the amplitude of the reduced shear , smooth the map with a 2d boxcar of side length @xmath24 and then compute the variance of the resulting map .",
    "the points are highly correlated .",
    "since we have full information about the shear and convergence from the simulation we are able to compare this with the plain shear results which are usually computed .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : svar ] shows the difference of this statistic computed for the reduced shear ( @xmath25 ) to that for plain shear ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we see that the reduced shear variance is larger than the usually predicted shear variance by a non - trivial amount .",
    "the bias very gradually drops as we go to larger scales ( not shown here ) but we are unable to follow it to convergence due to the finite size of the fields simulated .",
    "naively one might imagine that the corrections would be smaller than shown in figure [ fig : svar ] because @xmath2 is small ` on large scales ' .",
    "however @xmath2 is only small when averaged over a sizeable region of sky , and this smoothing does not commute with the division in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : red ] ) .",
    "this fact also means that perturbative calculations must be used with care , because the convergence or shear amplitude can be quite large on small scales leading to a break down of the approximation .",
    "though the smoothed shear variance has the worst behavior of the two point functions we consider , we will see qualitatively similar behavior below .",
    "in general this tendency for the small - scale power to be increased over the theoretical prediction for plain shear needs to be considered before attributing `` excess small - scale power '' to additional physical effects e.g.  intrinsic galaxy alignments",
    ". a signature of the effect might be the difference in the sensitivity of the various statistics that we compute here .",
    "another popular measure of the power is the aperture mass @xcite .",
    "this is a scalar quantity which can be derived from an integral over the shear @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the tangential shear as measured from @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a kernel .",
    "we have chosen the @xmath30 form for definiteness , so @xmath31 and @xmath29 vanishes for @xmath32 .",
    "the results for the aperture mass variance are shown in figure [ fig : mapvar ] .",
    "note that the correction is quite large on small scales , but drops rapidly on scales above a few arcminutes .",
    "finally we show results for the 2-point correlation function of the shear in figure [ fig : xip ] .",
    "this is the best behaved 2-point statistic that we consider , since it explicitly eliminates the contribution from small angular scales$ ] . ] .",
    "we define @xmath33 where @xmath34 is ( minus ) the component @xmath35 of the shear in the rotated frame whose @xmath36-axis is the separation vector between the two points being correlated .",
    "the component at @xmath37 is called @xmath38 .",
    "we find that the correction to the correlation function is quite small on the scales shown here .",
    "the correction to the other correlation function , @xmath39 , is even smaller than for @xmath40 .",
    "it is not too surprising that @xmath40 receives smaller corrections than var@xmath41 $ ] when we recall that @xmath42 probes smaller scales than @xmath24 by a factor of roughly @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "a smaller piece of the difference is that @xmath42 can be expressed as an integral over @xmath40 extending all the way to zero lag must have weight at zero lag . ] , making @xmath42 slightly more sensitive to the difference between @xmath25 and @xmath1 on small scales .",
    "a similar argument holds for var@xmath44 $ ] , with the effect being more pronounced .",
    "a reduction in the sensitivity to small scale power and to shot - noise could be obtained from differencing these measures between scales , with an associated loss of power .",
    "these are all of the 2-point functions commonly derived from shear data  the power spectrum has only been derived by two groups @xcite despite being almost ubiquitous in forecasts of the potential of future lensing experiments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the lensing maps are non - gaussian there is information beyond the 2-point statistics .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : equ ] the dominant 3-point function for equilateral triangles as a function of scale .",
    "the 3-point function is @xmath45 with @xmath34 defined with respect to a line joining the triangle center to each vertex @xcite . in the weakly non - gaussian limit one can argue that the corrections to the 3-point function from considering reduced shear could be very large .",
    "counting powers of our small parameter , @xmath2 or @xmath1 , the lowest order contribution vanishes in the gaussian limit .",
    "thus the first non - vanishing term is of order @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the first correction from the reduced shear also comes in at order @xmath46",
    ". however we see that the difference is not significantly larger than in the case of the 2-point functions on the scales shown here .",
    "we also show , in figure [ fig : tpt ] , how the configuration dependence of the 3-point function is modified . the 3-point function for triangles with sides @xmath47 and",
    "@xmath48 is plotted as a function of the cosine of the included angle .",
    "we have chosen here a triangle with no special symmetries in order to illustrate a `` typical '' case .",
    "note that the correction is dependent on angle , showing that the shear and reduced shear have different shape dependence which should be taken into account in cosmological inferences ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "deflection of light rays by gravitational potentials along the line of sight introduces a mapping between the source and image plane .",
    "the jacobian of this mapping defines the shear and convergence as a function of position on the sky . in the absence of size or magnification information neither the shear nor the convergence is observable ,",
    "rather the combination @xmath49 is .",
    "since on small scales @xmath2 can be non - negligible this introduces complications in predicting the observables of weak lensing .",
    "we have illustrated specifically the effect of using @xmath25 rather than @xmath1 on a number of commonly used statistics of weak lensing .",
    "we found that the correlation function is least affected , as expected since it specifically eliminates small - scale information .",
    "the variance of the shear amplitude , smoothed on a scale @xmath24 , is the most dramatically affected , and the amplitude of the effect declines very slowly with increasing smoothing scale .",
    "existing lensing experiments derive most of their cosmological constraints from angular scales of a few arcminutes to a few tens of arcminutes .",
    "the corrections described here are below the current statistical errors , and so should not affect existing constraints .",
    "the next generation of experiments may have sufficient control of systematic errors , and sufficient statistics , that this effect will need to be included in the analysis . note that even for the correlation function the difference between the commonly predicted plain shear result and the reduced shear value is comparable to the level of systematic control that we need to achieve to study dark energy ! if we are to reap the science rewards of future , high precision measurements of cosmic shear we will need to be able to include this effect in our theoretical predictions .",
