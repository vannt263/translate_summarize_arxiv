    "over the last few decades , electron - phonon interaction physics has offered a variety of intriguing and exciting phenomena such as superconductivity ( inorganic and organic ) , cdw states , colossal magnetoresistance , metal - insulator transition , polaronic ordered phases , etc @xcite . of the electron - phonon models available , the spinless holstein model @xcite is a simple and widely used model that mimics strongly correlated electron systems with a strong on - site coulombic repulsion and short range electron - phonon interactions .",
    "it was conjectured a long while ago by peierls that 1d electron - phonon metallic systems , such as the spinless holstein model , will undergo an electronic charge - density - wave ( cdw ) transition with a concomitant lattice distortion of the same periodicity @xcite .",
    "quasi-1d organic charge transfer salts [ such as ttf(tcnq ) ] and conjugated polymers [ such as @xmath4 as well as inorganic blue bronzes ( e.g. , @xmath5 ) , mixed valence platinum chain compounds ( e.g. , krogmann s salt ) , and transition metal chalcogenides ( e.g. , @xmath6 ) @xcite exhibit such spontaneous symmetry breaking in the ground state and are good candidates for the holstein model .",
    "furthermore , even the strongly correlated two - band manganite systems ( e.g. , @xmath7 ) @xcite , in the low - doped regime , can be modeled using the holstein model @xcite .",
    "contrary to the mean - field picture , at half - filling , it is now clear that the ll to cdw transition occurs only above a critical electron - phonon coupling strength that depends on the adiabaticity .",
    "progress has been made over the last few decades , in terms of studying the peierls transition at half - filling of the spinless holstein model , by using various techniques such as quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , two - cutoff renormalization - group analysis @xcite , variational method @xcite , density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite , and exact diagonalization @xcite .",
    "however , a controlled analytic treatment of the quantum phase transition has been reported only recently and that too only in the anti - adiabatic regime @xcite .",
    "contrastingly only little effort has been devoted to understand the quantum phase transition away from half - filling @xcite .",
    "the present paper is aimed at providing a well controlled analytic approach to understand the peierls quantum phase transition in the adiabatic regime for the one - dimensional spinless holstein model at a general filling .",
    "we employ a novel blocking approach that avoids the difficulties posed by both time - dependent- and degenerate - perturbation theories . using the condition",
    "that the effective phonon frequency becomes soft at the symmetry breaking point , we obtain an instability criterion that preempts the energy levels crossing condition for phase transition . in the adiabatic regime and at half - filling ,",
    "we capture the essential features of the ll - cdw transition results obtained by the  benchmark \" dmrg method in ref . @xcite . at fillings other than half ,",
    "we show that the ll phase certainly exists in the small polaron limit when @xmath8 and in the extreme anti - adiabatic regime .",
