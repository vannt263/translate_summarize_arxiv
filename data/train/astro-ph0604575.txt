    "clusters traditionally known as cooling flow clusters , with highly peaked surface brightness profiles and cool cores , typically host a large galaxy in their very centre ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "these galaxies would be expected to pollute their environment with metals , leading to peaked abundance distributions .",
    "such profiles are often seen in x - ray observations of the intracluster medium ( icm ) in cooling flow clusters ( e.g. fukazawa et al 1994 ; de grandi & molendi 2001 ) .",
    "however some clusters and elliptical galaxies exhibit a dip in abundance in their very centres , including centaurus ( sanders & fabian 2002 ) , abell  2199 ( johnstone et al 2002 ) , perseus ( sanders et al 2004 ; schmidt , fabian & sanders 2002 ; churazov et al 2003 ) and ngc  4636 ( jones et al 2002 ) .    some possible reasons for these abundance dips are resonance scattering ( gilfanov , syunyaev & churazov 1987 ) , incomplete spectral modelling ( e.g. buote 2000 ) , a bimodel metallicity distribution ( morris & fabian 2003 ) , and complex flows ( mathews et al 2003 ; fabian 2003 ) .",
    "resonance scattering in clusters of galaxies was first considered by gilfanov et al ( 1987 ) .",
    "they pointed out that clusters of galaxies could be optically thick at the energies of strong resonance lines .",
    "resonance transitions are transitions from the ground state of an ion .",
    "they are more likely to occur than other transitions as there are a large population of ions in the ground state .",
    "if there is a sufficient ion column density along a line - of - sight , radiation which would otherwise travel to the observer is scattered out of that line - of - sight into another one . as many resonance lines are strong emission lines , this may lead to an underestimate of the abundance of the gas in the centre of the cluster , and an overestimate in the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "we describe here a spectral model which includes the effects of resonance scattering , for use in fitting x - ray spectra from clusters of galaxies . by applying this model to data from clusters exhibiting an off - centre abundance peak",
    "we will assess whether resonance scattering can explain these effects .",
    "some authors report that resonance scattering is not important for the bulk of the x - ray emission from the core of the perseus cluster ( churazov et al 2004 ; gastaldello & molendi 2004 ) . it is however still unclear whether the emission from the very centre of the cluster , or the emission in l - shell lines are significantly affected by resonance scattering .",
    "several other authors have modelled resonance scattering in clusters , including a monte carlo radiative transfer method used on data from m87 ( mathews , buote & brighenti 2001 ) , and a radiative transfer method by shigeyama ( 1998 ) in elliptical galaxies .",
    "it should also be stated that resonance scattering has been considered important when modelling the solar corona ( e.g. acton 1978 ) .    rather than a full radiative transfer code , we have aimed for a simpler method which can be calculated in real - time whilst fitting x - ray spectra using xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "we assume the single - scattering approximation , and that photons are conserved .",
    "the method calculates the emission and scattering as a function of spectral energy in shells in the cluster . by integrating along lines - of - sight , model x - ray spectra from annuli on the sky",
    "are calculated for a particular temperature , abundance and density cluster profile .",
    "the model spectra are fit against data extracted from the appropriate annuli on the sky .",
    "the model can also self consistently account for photoelectrically absorbing material within the cluster .",
    "it is interesting to study the amount of this material as it is a possible contributing factor to the lack of emission lines seen emitted from cooling gas ( e.g. fabian et al 2001 ) , although such absorption would need to operate preferentially on the emission from the cool gas .",
    "we assume the solar abundance ratios of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) .",
    "for distance calculation , we assume that @xmath0 .",
    "all uncertainties shown are 1-@xmath1 .",
    "for a particular annulus , the model emission spectrum is calculated by summing the emission from each spherical shell along its line of sight through the cluster .",
    "if there are @xmath2 annuli on the sky , then @xmath2 shells are used to model the cluster .",
    "each shell is divided into @xmath3 `` subshells '' to allow for the variation of gas properties across the shell .",
    "a typical value of @xmath3 we use is 3 .",
    "in addition each annulus on the sky is similarly divided into @xmath3 `` subannuli '' .",
    "the spectrum from an annulus is the sum of the spectra from its subannuli .",
    "the electron density , temperature and solar relative abundance are specified at the centre of each shell .",
    "the gas properties of subshells are found using linear interpolation in logarithmic radius of the properties from the centres of the nearest shells , or by just using a fixed value within a shell .",
    "we later find that using constant values within each shell appears to produce more consistent results .",
    "in general , the model works as follows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] ) .",
    "we iterate over each of the subannuli on the sky . for a particular subannulus , we start at the far side of the cluster .",
    "we calculate the emission spectrum from the volume of intersection of the outermost subshell with that subannulus .",
    "this spectrum is carried forward towards the observer into the volume of intersection with the next subshell . using the list of resonance lines ,",
    "we compute how much radiation is scattered as a function of energy in that volume , and remove this radiation from the summed spectrum .",
    "the thermal emission from the volume is added to the sum , and the calculation carries on to the next subshell .        to account for radiation scattered into other lines of sight",
    ", we keep track of the total radiation scattered by a particular subshell .",
    "after we have summed along each line of sight , this spectrum is then distributed among the subannuli according to the fraction expected from rayleigh scattering .",
    "in addition the model can also take account of x - ray photoelectric absorption within each subshell , applying it consistently . within each volume of intersection",
    ", radiation is removed according to the column density the radiation intercepts .",
    "absorption is also applied to radiation scattered into other lines of sight .",
    "since the model cluster is spherically symmetric , it is only necessary to do the calculation along one line of sight .",
    "we discuss each of the steps of the model in detail below .",
    "we used the aped atomic data database ( version 1.3.1 ; smith et al 2001a ) to generate a list of resonance lines to use in the model .",
    "this enabled us to use the same source of lines as was used to calculate the emission spectra ( apec ; smith et al 2001b ) .    for each ion , we identified those lines involving transitions from the ground state ( i.e. the resonance lines ) .",
    "we took their einstein - a coefficients , @xmath4 , wavelengths , @xmath5 , and upper and lower statistical weights for the energy levels the transition is between , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . from these we calculated the oscillator strength of the lines , which in si units is for each @xmath8 where if @xmath9 , @xmath10    in fig .",

    ".    the cluster is modelled by shells in the cluster corresponding to the annuli on the sky .",
    "each shell is divided into @xmath19 subshells ( fig .  [",
    "fig : projdia ] ) .",
    "this gives a total of @xmath20 subshells , where @xmath19 is chosen to be as large as possible without making the calculation too slow .",
    "subshell @xmath12 lies between a radius of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the cluster .",
    "we use either a fixed temperature , abundance and density in the subshells within each shell , or linear interpolation in logarithmic radius of these values from the centre of each shell .",
    "the second option allows for a smooth distribution of gas components between each shell , which we refer to as `` interpolation '' in this paper .",
    "when interpolating , the properties within the inner half of the inner shell and the outer half of the outer shell are extrapolated in logarithmic radius from the neighbouring points",
    ".     corresponds to the radii of the annuli on the sky and the shells in the cluster , and radius @xmath23 corresponds to the radii of the subshells in the cluster . ]    for each subshell , @xmath12 , in the set of shells we calculate the spectrum of the emitting plasma per unit volume , @xmath24 , at high spectral resolution in order to adequately sample the major spectral lines over their line width .",
    "we used @xmath25 linear spectral elements between 0.3 and 9 kev , giving a spectral resolution of 0.087  ev .",
    "this is around half the thermal width of a 0.6  kev oxygen line at temperatures of 0.6  kev , or a 1  kev iron line at the same temperature .",
    "the spectrum is calculated using a rewritten implementation of the apec model in xspec , highly optimised for the case of fixed spectral resolution .",
    "it works by precalculating high - resolution spectra at the apec grid - points .",
    "the implementation also includes a gaussian approximation for the thermal widths of the spectral lines plus an additional turbulence component .",

    "in addition to the emission spectrum in each subshell , also calculated is the scattering coefficient , @xmath32 , in units of length@xmath33 , over the same energy range and resolution as the emitted spectrum . in order to calculate the scattering coefficient we iterate over each of the resonance lines in the energy range considered . for each line",
    "we calculate the scattering profile using ( again mathews et al 2001 ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the hydrogen density of the shell , found using @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the abundance of the element producing the line relative to solar , @xmath38 is the solar abundance of the element relative to hydrogen , and @xmath39 is the fraction of the element ionised into the ion producing the line ( which is a function of the temperature of the subshell ) .",
    "we use the ionisation fractions of mazzotta et al ( 1998 ) , interpolating between the provided values . the dimensionless line frequency , @xmath40 .",
    "we add the line scattering profile ( calculated out to three times @xmath31 from the central frequency ) to the total ` scattering coefficient spectrum ' for the subshell , accounting for redshift .      to model the spectrum in an annulus",
    ", we divide the annulus into @xmath19 subannuli ( this is chosen to be the same as @xmath19 as was used to create the subshells in section [ sect : emissspec ] , but this need not be the same value ) . along the centre of each subannulus , we integrate along the line - of - sight from the back of the cluster to the observer .",
    "we take account of the radiation emitted in a particular subshell , and the radiation scattered out of the line - of - sight by that subshell .",
    "optionally , absorbed radiation is also removed . when the spectra for all of the subannuli has been calculated , the code takes the radiation scattered by a particular subshell , computes the fraction scattered into each annulus on the sky , and adds this back to give the final model spectra .",

    "may be indicating that there is photoelectrically absorbing material in that region .",
    "there is also evidence for small spatial scale absorbing material in the central regions of the cluster with a similar morphology to the dust lane in ngc  4696 ( crawford et al 2005 ) .",

    "[ fig : cenprof ] .",
    "the amount of absorption found in the western half of centaurus appears fairly consistent between the model variants , except perhaps in the very innermost annulus .",
    "the level of absorption appears to increase inside 40  kpc radius , in the form of a rough power law .",
    "the region with the apparent absorbing material appears to be only that gas below around 2.5  kev .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath67 within the inner 40  kpc , would indicate an equivalent absorbing hydrogen density of @xmath68 . within 40  kpc",
    "this would correspond to a mass of @xmath69 of absorbing material assuming solar relative abundances .",
    "we should note , however , that there is a build - up of contaminant on the acis detector , which is not spatially uniform ( see sanders et al 2004 for a map of this contaminant from a perseus cluster observation ) .",
    "although the mkwarf tool that we used to create the ancillary responses includes a correction for the spatial variation of this contaminant over time , there may still be uncertainties in this calibration .",
    "it is possible that the evidence we show is due to calibration uncertainties .",
    "the absorbing material on small spatial scales found by crawford et al ( 2005 ) indicates that the calibration is not likely to be responsible for all of the signal within the central regions .",
    "it will be important to confirm the absorption detection in data from _ xmm - newton _ in future .",
    "our model shows that the effect of resonance scattering in the two clusters of galaxies examined is minimal to the determination of abundances from ccd resolution x - ray spectra .",
    "the change in abundance measured is less than 10  per  cent .",
    "the model assumes that spherical symmetry is a good approximation in these clusters .",
    "it also ignores the effects of non - solar abundance ratios , or the presence of multiphase gas which is not the result of projection .",
    "the largest effect on the determined abundance in the central regions is using a model which allows for an interpolated range of components in each shell .",
    "although this should produce results which more closely match the real profile if the gas properties vary smoothly , it seems that it is prone to effects which cause instability and oscillating profiles ( e.g. in the outer parts of the eastern temperature profile , the western profile at high spatial resolution ; fig .",
    "[ fig : cenproffine ] , and the inner region of the eastern abundance profile ) .",
    "we suspect that non - spherical geometry may be a the cause of this instability .",
    "the inner parts of the cluster show obvious asymmetric features .",
    "the cluster , centred on ngc  4696 , is also thought to be merging or has merged with a subcluster 15  arcmin to the east centred on ngc  4709 ( allen & fabian 1994 ; churazov et al 1999 ; furusho et al 2001 ; dupke & bregman 2001 ) .",
    "the oscillations are particularly evident in the outer regions on the eastern sector .",
    "although resonance scattering appears not to be important when examining low spectral resolution spectra from clusters of galaxies ( at least in clusters similar to centaurus ) , it is an important process when examining high resolution x - ray cluster spectra in detail .",
    "the effect increases the strength of the fe - k resonance lines by up to 30  per  cent from the centre of the centaurus cluster if turbulence can be neglected .",
    "the effect on fe - l resonance lines is smaller ( @xmath70  per  cent ) , but there are many more of them . when fitting the low resolution ccd spectra from _ chandra _ the effect on the obtained abundance is small ( @xmath70  per  cent ) .",
    "however , if turbulence is low the effect will be important to consider when examining high spectral resolution data .",
    "the straightness of the h@xmath71 filaments in the perseus cluster suggests that the intracluster medium may not be highly turbulent ( fabian et al 2003 ) , although gas flows @xmath72 are inevitable",
    ". it will be useful to include resonance scattering effects when examining higher resolution spectra from the _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometers , or from a future x - ray bolometer mission .",
    "photoelectric absorption affects the spectra emitted from the innermost regions of clusters of galaxies , as is indicated by the small scale variations in ngc  4696 ( crawford et al 2005 ) .",
    "we find evidence for larger scale absorbing material in centaurus , providing calibration uncertainties are not important .",
    "if this absorbing material can preferentially act on the radiation from cool material , it has the possibility of disguising the rate of cooling in the cluster ( fabian et al 2001 ) .",
    "our results show that accounting for projection , resonance scattering and absorption does not remove the abundance drop seen in the centre of the centaurus cluster .",
    "unfortunately this result is not as clear cut as we would like .",
    "we have shown that when fitting projected spectra , allowing for extra absorption , and using three temperature components , it is possible to lose the drop in the central metallicity ( fabian et al 2005 ) .",
    "the uncertainty on the innermost gas abundance does however , increase substantially , which means the drop may or may not exist .",

    "we discuss this further in sanders & fabian ( in preparation ) , where we will also examine the relative abundances in more depth , in the context of models of enrichment .",
    "the plots show that there are declines in metallicity in many elements , even with this fairly complex model .",
    "the declines are not as deep as for single temperature projected models , however . if there is additional absorption within the central region ( as we may have detected ) , or additional temperature components which do not have spherical symmetry , then this could remove the drop .",
    "we have also tried simple single - temperature models , but including a nonthermal component in the innermost bins , but this was insufficient .        although the drop in centaurus may be removed with a complex enough spectral model",
    ", it is more difficult to remove the decline seen in the perseus cluster , for which we have done detailed spatial mapping ( sanders et al 2004 ; sanders , fabian & dunn 2005 ) .",

    ". it may be possible that the inclusion of a range of detected multiphase gas ( fabian et al 2006 ) , and nonthermal emission ( sanders et al 2005 ) , may help remove the drop , but our initial results indicate that they do not .",
    "the relative amount of cool gas in the perseus cluster is much smaller than centaurus , compared to the hotter gas .",

    "<S> a possible explanation for the central abundance dips found from spatially - resolved x - ray spectroscopy of several groups and clusters of galaxies is resonance scattering . </S>",
    "<S> a number of the prominent iron emission lines are resonance lines . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a unique spectral model which takes account of resonance scattering for several thousand resonance lines , projection effects , photoelectric absorption , and allows direct spectral fitting . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our model to _ chandra _ observations of two clusters with pronounced central abundance dips , centaurus and abell  2199 . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the effect of resonance scattering on emission from the centre of the cluster can be as much as 30  per  cent for the fe - k resonance lines , and 10  per  cent for several fe - l lines , if turbulence is low . </S>",
    "<S> the change to the metallicities obtained by fitting low resolution ccd spectra is at most 10  per  cent . </S>",
    "<S> accounting for resonance scattering does not remove the central dip . allowing for internal absorption within the centaurus </S>",
