    "the entropy production of the surrounding medium of a system driven out of equilibrium is arguably the most convenient tool for quantifying the irreversiblity . in the long time limit when the steady state value of the entropy production arising due to the boundary contributions could be neglected ,",
    "the probability distribution function @xmath1 for the change in the medium entropy @xmath2 at time @xmath3 , is known to satisfy certain symmetry relation , generally known as the fluctuation theorem @xcite : @xmath4 this symmetry relation implies that the probability of observing the entropy annihilation over a long time interval becomes negligibly small and can be viewed as the nonequilibrium generalization of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the derivation of the distribution function in the asymptotic time limit is often performed by finding out the corresponding large deviation function(ldf ) @xmath5 which is related to the distribution function as , @xmath6 the ldf plays the role of the free energy functions in equilibrium systems @xcite and in the case of nonequilibrium systems , its symmetry property , @xmath7 , validates the fluctuation theorem or the gallavotti - cohen symmetry @xcite .",
    "for a system described by the continuous time markov dynamics , a microscopic transition from its configuration @xmath8 to @xmath9 with a transition rate , @xmath10 , causes the entropy of the surrounding medium to change @xcite by the amount @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , the boltzmann constant , is assumed to be unity .",
    "of the many studies on the entropy production of the medium for systems with microscopic reversibility @xcite , some recent works on the properties of the ldf and its symmetry relation can be found in @xcite where the authors studied the asymptotic distributions of the entropy production by finding out the ldf using a generating function based approach . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors obtained the ldf for partially asymmetric simple exclusion processes and reaction - diffusion processes with microscopic reversibility .",
    "the emergence of a kink - like feature in the ldf at zero entropy production was argued to be generic for such processes .",
    "this kink could be characterized by the average value of the medium entropy production rate , making the entropy production rate a good candidate for quantifying the irreversibility in nonequilibrium systems .",
    "while there is a wide applicability of the above formula for finding the medium entropy production for nonequilibrium systems having bi - directional transitions between its various states , this formula can not be applied directly when we encounter a system with irreversible microscopic transitions between its states @xcite .",
    "totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes(tasep ) where particles move in only one direction respecting the exclusion principle is one such example of systems with irreversible microscopic transition .",
    "other examples include enzymatic reaction networks modeled by michaelis - menten scheme , directed percolation etc . in these systems",
    "when some of the transition rates @xmath10 become zero , this formula predicts an infinite entropy production which have not been observed in realistic situations @xcite . to address this shortcoming , ben - avraham _ et _ _ al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a regularization scheme by sampling the states of the system at small time interval and obtained the modified transition probabilities . using those transition probabilities , they computed the medium entropy production rate and its ldf for a three - state irreversible loop . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors used a slightly different method by introducing small backward transitions and determined the lower bound for the average rate of medium entropy production originating from the predominant irreversible transitions .    in this paper , we obtain the effective time - dependent transition rates for systems with irreversible transitions by allowing the systems to undergo all possible allowed transitions over small time interval @xmath0 and , then , deriving the probabilities of transition between any two states at the end of the time interval , @xmath0 .",
    "the new transition rates are identical to the original transition rates for small @xmath0 .",
    "these transition rates allow us to extend straightforwardly the generating function based approach used earlier @xcite to find out the ldf for the mean entropy production for irreversible systems . for a two - site tasep and a three - state irreversible system , we first obtain the transition probabilities between any two arbitrary states by solving the governing master equations .",
    "the transition rates are obtained after keeping the leading order terms in @xmath0 in the taylor expansion of the time - dependent probabilities and then differentiating with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "these new rates are used to obtain the average rate of medium entropy production and further to obtain the ldf for the entropy production through a saddle point approximation . at zero entropy production ,",
    "the ldfs for both the models show a kink which can be characterized by the average entropy production rate @xcite .",
    "finally , the ldf is used to find the distribution of the entropy production in the long time limit . in the case of a two - site tasep ,",
    "the average rate of medium entropy production monotonically increases with the particle injection and withdrawal rates @xmath13 . for large values of the medium entropy production rate ,",
    "the distribution function for the entropy production appears like a gaussian distribution .",
    "for low entropy production rates , the distribution function turns out to be a non - gaussian one .",
    "the features of the ldf that are responsible for producing the non - gaussian shape of the entropy distribution function are strongly ( exponentially ) suppressed in the case of large entropy production rates .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we introduce the entropy production formalisms for markov jump processes and a practical way to apply those for systems having unidirectional transitions . in section [ sec:3 ] , we first compute the rate of medium entropy production in the nonequilibrium steady state for two - site tasep with equal injection and withdrawal rates denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "next , we obtain the ldf as well as the distribution function for the medium entropy production for different values of @xmath13 . in section [ sec:4 ] , using the same lines of approach , we obtain the analytical form of the ldf for entropy production for a three - state irreversible loop .",
    "the results are summarized in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "in this section , we first present a brief overview of these relations @xcite valid for stochastic dynamics modeled as continuous time markovian dynamics with finite , discrete configuration space .",
    "next , we elucidate the feasibility of using the known entropy production formulae for a system having one or more microscopically irreversible transitions between its finite number of discrete states . due to the microscopic irreversibility inherent in the system ,",
    "some of the transition rates involved in the entropy production formulations are zero . here , without introducing negligibly small backward transition rates as was done in @xcite , we obtain the new set of transition rates by sampling the states of the system at a small time interval @xmath0 . in the limit @xmath14 , these new transition rates approach their original values , thus making the computations of entropy production rate and its ldf more accurate .",
    "we consider a continuous - time markov jump process , for the time interval @xmath15 , with finite number of states .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the probability @xmath16 , that the system is found in state @xmath8 , is described by the master equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath10 are the transition rates for the jump from state @xmath9 to @xmath8 and from state @xmath8 to @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "equation([1 ] ) can be written in matrix form as , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the column matrix and the @xmath21th element of the transition matrix @xmath22 are @xmath23    in order to obtain the expression for the entropy production due to a transition from one state to another , we begin by defining the average gibbs entropy of the system as @xmath24 the expression for the time evolution of the system entropy has the form @xcite @xmath25 where the overdot implies a derivative with respect to time . the first term on the right hand side of the above relation is always positive and is identified as the total entropy production rate due to stochastic transitions .",
    "the second term is the medium entropy production rate or the entropy flow into the medium due to these transitions .",
    "the total rate of the entropy production is now expressed as @xmath26 with @xmath27      in order to calculate the medium entropy production rate , we first briefly describe the strategy to compute the transition rates employing a matrix - based approach . to begin with ,",
    "we consider a markov process in which transitions between the discrete states @xmath28 are measured in discrete time steps , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",

    "the diagonal matrix @xmath34 has the eigenvalues of @xmath22 as its diagonal elements .",
    "the solution of equation([matrix_form ] ) then reads @xmath35 the elements of the @xmath36 matrix are the transition probabilities .",
    "for instance , the element @xmath37 , in conventional notation , implies @xmath38 , i.e. , the probability of finding the system at @xmath8-th state at time @xmath3 , provided it was at @xmath9-th state at the initial time .",
    "these transition probabilities allow us to obtain the time - dependent transition rates @xcite if the states of the system are sampled at small time interval @xmath39 . to be more specific , let us consider the probability @xmath40 at time @xmath41 of finding the system at state @xmath8 . in the limit @xmath42",

    "the distribution functions @xmath97 for three different values of @xmath13 are plotted in figure [ fig : entropy_prodiction_dist ] .    to have a qualitative understanding of the distribution function for larger values of @xmath84 , it should be noted from figure [ fig : largedeviation](a ) that the values of the ldf from its minimum are larger if the rate of medium entropy production is increased .",

    "the matching between the original distribution and the approximated one is remarkable and thus , the distribution can be approximated as gaussian for large @xmath84 .",

    "in summary , we have obtained the ldf and the probability distribution function for the medium entropy production for a two - site tasep and a three - state cyclic process .",
    "both tasep and the three - state process involve irreversible transitions due to the hopping of particles in a specific direction and the unicyclic nature of the three - state process . in order to apply the general results of entropy production for stochastic jump processes",
    ", we obtained first the time - dependent transition rates by sampling the states of the systems over a short time interval .",
    "these new transition rates are incorporated in the subsequent derivations of the ldf for the entropy production which satisfies gallavotti - cohen symmetry .",
    "for the two - site tasep , the value of the ldf for large fluctuations becomes higher as the average entropy production rate is increased . as a consequence of this , the distribution function tends to be gaussian . for smaller values of particle injection and withdrawal rates , which in turn makes the average entropy production rate smaller ,",
    "the distribution function becomes non - gaussian and it resembles poisson distribution because of lesser number of events over the time interval . for the three - state irreversible loop , we have found the analytical forms of the smallest eigenvalue and the ldf . for both the processes , the smallest eigenvalue and the ldf",
    "are derived keeping the first order terms in @xmath0 in the new transition rates .",
    "the smallest eigenvalue and the ldf for the medium entropy production satisfy the fluctuation theorem .",
    "our results for the three - state process differ slightly from the previous study @xcite since we incorporate here the conventional definition of the transition rates in the subsequent derivations of the smallest eigenvalue and the ldf . in reference",
    "@xcite , applying bayes theorem to the posterior probabilities , it has been shown that the microscopic reversibility condition is not a necessity to propose a generalize fluctuation theorem for total entropy production . since",
    "using time coarse - graining procedure , we obtain nonzero reverse transition probabilities even for processes involving irreversible transitions , it is expected that this procedure leads to holding symmetry relations of certain kinds for the probability distribution of entropy production . using similar coarsening theorem ,",
    "the authors in reference @xcite have shown the validity of integral fluctuation theorem and crooks relation for hatano - sasa entropy of many - state irreversible processes .",
    "finally , the present methodology based on derivation of the time - dependent transition rates seems to be useful for studying a broad range of models relevant to physical and biophysical processes including complex networks involving multiple degrees of freedom @xcite .",
