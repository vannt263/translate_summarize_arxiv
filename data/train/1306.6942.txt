    "<S> the concept of polarization in gyrokinetic theory is clarified and generalized to include contributions from the guiding - center ( zeroth - order ) polarization as well as the nonlinear ( second - order ) gyrocenter polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the guiding - center polarization , which appears as the antecedent ( zeroth - order ) of the standard linear ( first - order ) gyrocenter polarization , is obtained from a modified guiding - center transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear gyrocenter polarization is derived either variationally from the third - order gyrocenter hamiltonian or directly by gyrocenter push - forward method .    </S>",
