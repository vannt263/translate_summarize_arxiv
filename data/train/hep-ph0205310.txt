    "the mass insertion approximation ( mia ) is often used to simplify expressions involving supersymmetric contributions to flavour changing neutral current processes from loop diagrams  @xcite .",
    "the simplification is achieved by the replacement of a sum over all possible internal propagators and the appropriate mixing at the vertices , with a single ( small ) off - diagonal mass insertion in a basis where all gauge couplings are diagonal .",
    "the resulting expressions are formulated in terms of parameters which can be estimated in various supersymmetric models .",
    "it may seem , naively , that the smallness of the off - diagonal mass - squared matrix element would justify the approximation . the true picture , however , is that these off - diagonal elements are the product of mixing angles at the vertices and mass - squared differences between intermediate squarks .",
    "the mia , on the other hand , is a taylor expansion only with respect to the latter , namely , the mass - squared difference ( we give an exact formulation of these statements in section  [ sec : form - mass - insert ] ) .",
    "a small off - diagonal element does not necessarily imply a small mass difference .",
    "instead , it may be related to small mixing angles .",
    "but then the validity of the mia is questionable .",
    "this is exactly the situation in the framework of quark - squark alignment ( qsa ) models  @xcite . in this class of supersymmetric models the squark masses - squared",
    "are all of the same order of magnitude , a free parameter denoted by @xmath2 , and the mass squared differences between them are also of the same order of magnitude , that is : @xmath3 .",
    "apriori , this is a problematic situation for using the mia . yet",
    ", it is frequently used in the literature .",
    "but not of the individual masses , the mia provides the best way to derive meaningful results . ]",
    "we therefore study the validity of the mia in the context of qsa models .",
    "we confirm that the approximation is applicable and useful for such models .",
    "we also clarify the connection between the ( unknown ) details of the squark mass spectrum and the mia parameters .",
    "the organization of this work is as follows : we formulate the details of the mia in section  [ sec : form - mass - insert ] .",
    "the analysis and our results for non - degenerate squarks masses are presented in section  [ sec : analys - non - degen ] .",
    "let us first formulate the details of the mia . to illustrate it in the context of qsa , we study a specific example : the supersymmetric contribution to neutral @xmath4 meson mixing from gluino box diagrams with two intermediate squarks .",
    "the relevant diagrams are shown in figure  [ fig : boxdiag ] .",
    "we focus on the following term arising from these diagrams  @xcite : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is a numerical factor , given in terms of the @xmath4 meson parameters : @xmath7 @xmath8 are the quark - squark mixing angles , and @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 with @xmath11 the gluino mass , @xmath12 the down squark masses and @xmath13 \\ ; ,    \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath14\\;.    \\end{split}\\ ] ]     - @xmath15 mixing . ]",
    "the mia is nothing more than a taylor expansion of @xmath9 .",
    "we choose to expand the squark masses around some point @xmath16 .",
    "owing to the specific form of @xmath9 we find @xmath17 where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath20 is the @xmath21th derivative of @xmath9 evaluated at @xmath16 , times the symmetry factor @xmath22 .",
    "( the exact form of the coefficient is not important for our purpose . )    substituting   in   we get @xmath23      \\left[z^d_{2j}\\left(\\delta\\mj^2\\right)^n     z^{d\\dag}_{j1}\\right]\\right\\ } \\;.\\ ] ] note that a sum over @xmath24 and @xmath25 is implied .",
    "if the mia is valid , this expansion converges fast and we can keep only the lowest order terms . however , due to the unitarity of @xmath26 , the terms with either @xmath27 or @xmath28 vanish . the first non - vanishing contribution , therefore , will be from the term with @xmath29 .",
    "this term , however , is special since we can write ( again , a sum over @xmath25 is implied ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the squark mass - squared matrix in the basis where quarks masses and gluino couplings are diagonal .",
    "thus , if the mia holds we can replace   with : @xmath32 we stress that a small @xmath33 is not enough , by itself , to justify the use of the mia .",
    "the question of validity should be considered in the context of eq .  .",
    "we note , however , that the quality  of the mia is not completely equivalent to the quality of the approximation that is obtained by keeping only the lowest terms in  .",
    "the reason is that the zeroth order term ( @xmath34 ) , the first order terms ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) and some of the second order terms ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , while appearing in  , do not contribute to the mixing amplitude in   due to the unitarity of @xmath26 .",
    "in other words , the validity of   has to do with one of the second order terms in  , rather than with all lowest order terms .    nonetheless , it is obvious that when the expansion parameter is small , @xmath39 , the approximation is good .",
    "it is the condition in qsa models , @xmath40 which needs a special consideration .",
    "in order to study quantitatively the non - degenerate case , we simplify the form of @xmath26 by assuming that only one mixing angle , namely @xmath41 , is large .",
    "this is usually the case in qsa models .",
    "such an assumption allows us to consider only the first two generations .",
    "expression   then simplifies to @xmath42 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the single large mixing angle .",
    "equivalently ,   can be written as @xmath44 the above expression manifestly demonstrates the vanishing of terms with either @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "the mia is obtained by keeping in   only the term with @xmath29 @xmath45 we can now test the accuracy of the mia by defining the deviation parameter ( using the symmetry of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) @xmath48 figure  [ fig : mqsolve1 ] shows @xmath49 as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 tev , @xmath53 tev .      obviously , when @xmath54 , we expect the deviation to be small . the interesting result , however , is that the deviation is small ( of order @xmath55 ) even for non - degenerate @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as long as @xmath56 .",
    "this is the case , for example , when @xmath57 tev , @xmath58 tev and @xmath52 tev . in other words ,",
    "the result of the exact expression   using @xmath50 and @xmath51 , can be reproduced using the mia of   with @xmath59 and the knowledge of @xmath60 .",
    "we see , therefore , that as long as the squark masses are not strongly hierarchical , the ` right ' choice of the expansion point @xmath16 results with the mia being a rather accurate approximation .",
    "this is very useful in qsa models where we have @xmath61 .",
    "the amplitudes in these models can therefore be expressed in the mia by using @xmath62 .",
    "although this result was demonstrated here for a specific mixing contribution and using specific assumptions on the mixing angles , we found it to be quite a general result .",
    " @xmath63 mixing . ]",
    "the result @xmath59 is not trivial . looking at  , it seems that the best strategy is to choose @xmath64 .",
    "this choice results with @xmath65 , which eliminates all terms with either @xmath66 or @xmath67 even .",
    "odd are eliminated , since @xmath68 odd implies either @xmath66 even and @xmath67 odd or vice versa .",
    "some of the @xmath68 even terms which are due to both @xmath66 and @xmath67 even are eliminated as well . ] in particular , it eliminates the next - to - leading order terms with either @xmath69 or @xmath70 . naively , one would expect faster convergence in this case and therefore obtaining a good approximation .",
    "this naive expectation is , however , wrong . studying the form of the coefficients @xmath71 we find that the sign flips between even and odd @xmath68 terms . the choice @xmath72 , which eliminates all odd @xmath68 terms , eliminates therefore all the negative sign terms in  .",
    "since the @xmath71 coefficients decrease slowly , this induces a larger error and a worse approximation .    on the other hand",
    ", we find that the choice @xmath59 is the most sensible one since it leads to an approximate cancellation between the next - to - leading order and the next - to - next - to - leading order terms .",
    "the extent to which such a choice is optimal , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : mqsolve1 ] , is remarkable .      to summarize , we confirm that the common practice of using the mia in supersymmetric models is justified even in the case of non - degenerate squark masses , as long as the masses are not strongly hierarchical .",
    "we showed that over a wide range of masses , the best strategy is to choose the mia expansion point @xmath16 to be the average of the masses involved . using this strategy ,",
    "the mia provides a surprisingly good calculation of neutral meson mixing in models where a single mixing angle dominates , such as qsa  @xcite and ` effective supersymmetry '  @xcite ."
