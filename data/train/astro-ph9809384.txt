    "sgr a east is an elliptical shell structure elongated along the galactic plane with a major axis of length @xmath9 pc and a center displaced from the apparent dynamical nucleus , sgr a west , by @xmath10 pc in projection toward negative galactic latitudes .",
    "the latter is a ( @xmath11 pc ) three - arm spiral configuration of ionized gas ( ekers et al . 1983 ; lo & claussen 1983 ) that engulfs a compact nonthermal radio source , sgr a * , having a dimension between 1.1 au and 0.1 au ( morris & serabyn 1996 ) .",
    "the bulk of the thermally emitting sgr a west appears to be located in front of sgr a east ( yusef - zadeh & morris 1987 ; pedlar et al . 1989 ) , whose exact distance behind the nucleus is not known , but a number of arguments suggest that it is positioned very close to the galactic center ( e.g. , gsten & downes 1980 ; goss et al .",
    "1989 ; yusef - zadeh et al . 1998 ) .",
    "thus , if present , the massive black hole ( presumably associated with sgr a * ) lies within the sgr a east shell , but at one extreme end of its elongated structure .",
    "sgr a east may be a supernova remnant ( snr ) , but its inferred energetics ( @xmath0 ergs ; mezger et al .",
    "1989 ) and size appear to be extreme and have generated some uncertainty regarding this interpretation .",
    "the explosion that produced sgr a east may have been the tidal disruption of a main sequence star whose trajectory took it within ten schwarzschild radii of the central object ( khokhlov & melia 1996 ) .",
    "however , regardless of what actually caused the initial explosion , recent observations of this region at 1720 mhz ( the transition frequency of oh maser emission ) have revealed the presence of several maser spots on the remnant s boundary ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "this is important because oh masers can be effective tracers of shocks produced at the interface with molecular clouds , particularly for supernova remnants ( frail et al .",
    "1994 ; wardle , yusef - zadeh & geballe 1998 ) .",
    "radio continuum observations of this object at @xmath12 and @xmath13 cm ( pedlar et al .",
    "1989 ) reveal that these sites are also nonthermal emitters , but if this is due to synchrotron , then a relativistic electron distribution with @xmath14 is required , where @xmath15 .",
    "this is rather peculiar for several reasons .",
    "first , such a particle spectrum is unlike that ( @xmath16 ; jones & ellison 1991 ) thought to be produced directly in shock acceleration .",
    "second , this situation appears to be different from that of other snrs in which @xmath17 ( e.g. , gaisser et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "this latter distinction is very noticeable in view of the kinship between sgr a east and other snrs suggested by egret observations ( see e.g. , green 1995 ; esposito et al .",
    "1996 ; saken et al . 1992 ; lessard et al .",
    "the galactic center is very complex and the @xmath3-rays from this region may be produced by other means .",
    "for example , the egret @xmath3-ray source 2egj1746 - 2852 may be the black hole candidate sgr a * ( markoff , melia & sarcevic 1997 ; mahadevan et al .",
    "1997 ) or it may be due to a process different than what is producing the @xmath3-ray emission in the snrs ( melia , yusef - zadeh & fatuzzo 1998 ; see below ) . our goal in this _",
    "letter _ is to demonstrate in a self - consistent manner how the radio through tev spectrum of sgr a east may be produced with a single process , and how it can be placed in context with the other egret snrs when one takes into account the differences between the ambient medium surrounding sgr a east and that of the other remnants .",
    "egret has identified a central ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19 mev - @xmath20 gev continuum source with luminosity @xmath21 ergs s@xmath22 ( mayer - hasselwander et al .",
    "its @xmath3-ray flux does not vary down to the instrument sensitivity ( roughly a @xmath23 amplitude ) , suggesting that it may be diffuse ( see , however , markoff , melia & sarcevic 1997 ) . in a recent study ( melia , yusef - zadeh & fatuzzo 1998 )",
    ", we showed that the @xmath3-ray characteristics of 2egj1746 - 2852 may be understood as arising from inverse compton scatterings between the power - law e@xmath24 ( inferred from the radio data ) and the uv and ir photons from the nucleus .",
    "this is facilitated by the unique environment at the galactic center , where the inner @xmath25 pc region is a source of intense ( stellar ) uv and ( dust - reprocessed ) far - ir radiation that bathes the extended synchrotron - emitting structures .",
    "however , this analysis left several questions unanswered .",
    "for example , it is rather suspicious that the galactic center @xmath3-ray source has a similarly distinctive bump at @xmath26 gev as the five snrs detected by egret ( see , e.g. , esposito et al . 1996 ) . in their detailed calculations of the emission in the snr shells of ic 443 and @xmath3 cygni , gaisser , protheroe and stanev ( 1998 )",
    "included the contribution to ic from microwave background radiation , the galactic ir / optical background radiation and the ir resulting from shock - heated dust .",
    "at least in these snrs , the dominant contributions to the @xmath3-ray spectrum come from bremsstrahlung ( by relativistic electrons colliding with the ambient proton distribution ) and pion decay , the latter constituting the aforementioned @xmath27 mev characteristic bump .",
    "thus , if 2egj1746 - 2852 is the @xmath3-ray counterpart to the radio emitting shell in sgr a east , one might expect that its @xmath3-ray bump could also be due to pion decays . at the same time , an observationally significant pion production rate in sgr a east also offers the exciting possibility that the @xmath28 pion decay byproducts may produce the @xmath29 power - law distribution inferred from sgr a east s radio spectrum , and these particles then also self - consistently account for the underlying @xmath3-ray spectrum via either bremsstrahlung , or the ic scattering of the central ir and uv photons .",
    "we work with the hypothesis that the egret @xmath3-ray bump is due primarily to @xmath4 decays ( @xmath30 ) , these being produced in @xmath31 scatterings between ambient protons and a relativistic population accelerated by shocks within the sgr a east shell . in this process ,",
    "a multiplicity of pions is produced , the charged members of which decay leptonically ( @xmath32 , with @xmath33 ) .",
    "we first find the physical conditions required to produce this @xmath3-ray bump , and then use the associated electrons and positrons produced in the pion decays to calculate the radio spectrum . fitting the synchrotron emission to the vla data ( see fig .",
    "3 ) is then a matter of adjusting just one unknown , viz .",
    "the average magnetic field @xmath34 in the gyration region , though this is expected to be close to equipartition .",
    "a full description of our @xmath31 scattering algorithm is given elsewhere ( markoff , melia & sarcevic 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "briefly , we assume that the accelerated protons are accelerated at the shock with a rate of @xmath35 @xmath36 s@xmath22 gev@xmath22 .",
    "the steady - state proton spectral index is thought to lie in the range of @xmath37 ( jones & ellison 1991 ) , and is determined from a diffusion loss treatment . because the protons are ultrarelativistic , the leading order nucleons produced will continue contributing to the spectrum via multiple collisions in an ensuing cascade , until they lose enough of their energy to rejoin the ambient plasma .",
    "the procedure for calculating the pion production rate is complicated by the energy dependence of the pion multiplicity and the @xmath31 scattering cross section .",
    "fortunately , uncertainties in the @xmath31 scattering are likely to be smaller than @xmath38 , within the possible errors of the astrophysical components , such as the source size .",
    "we calculate the steady - state proton distribution resulting from the balance of injection from the shock , cascade collisions producing secondary particles which feed back into the system , and synchrotron and inverse compton losses .",
    "we note that proton - photoproduction processes are here relatively insignificant , since the maximum energy attained by the relativistic protons in the face of energy losses due to @xmath31 scatterings and other processes is about @xmath39 gev , close to the pair creation threshold for protons scattering off uv radiation ( see below ) .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the @xmath3-ray spectrum produced from @xmath4 decays for two different cases , characterized by their respective values of @xmath40 and the ambient proton density @xmath41 .",
    "of course , the full spectrum will be the sum of this component and those arising from bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering , which we consider below .",
    "however , we can already see that the fit to the @xmath3-ray data between @xmath42 mev and @xmath20 gev is rather robust over a range of conditions .",
    "what does change from case to case is the energy content in the relativistic proton population , which is related to the efficiency introduced above .",
    "so , for example , when the ambient proton density @xmath41 is low ( case 2 ) , the removal rate of protons from the relativistic distribution is smaller than that in case 1 , resulting in a higher equilibrium density of relativistic protons .",
    "this is why the energy content of these particles is much higher in case 2 than in case 1 , accounting for roughly @xmath43 and @xmath44 of a typical sn burst of @xmath45 ergs for these two situations , respectively .",
    "the electron distribution resulting from these two cases is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the @xmath46 and @xmath47 distributions can mimic a power - law with a spectral index @xmath7 very well , consistent with the value implied by the radio spectrum of sgr a east .",
    "apparently , the leptons produced in @xmath5 decays in this source are numerically dominant over those accelerated directly within shocks .",
    "in fact , assuming the same spectral index for the electrons and protons , the shock would have to accelerate roughly @xmath48 as many of the former compared to the latter at any given energy in order to account for the synchrotron emissivity without the decay leptons .",
    "this imbalance comes about because ( 1 ) each relativistic proton produces an average of @xmath49 electrons and ( 2 ) a shock accelerated electron distribution would contain a much larger contribution from low energy electrons than the distribution shown in figure 2 , which shows a deficiency at small @xmath3 .",
    "these relativistic electrons are immersed in an intense source of uv and ir radiation from the central @xmath25 parsecs .",
    "the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) is a powerful source ( @xmath50 ) of mid to far - infrared continuum emission with a dust temperature of @xmath51 k ( e.g. , telesco et al .",
    "1996 ; davidson et al .",
    "this radiation is due to reprocessing by warm dust that has absorbed the same power in the uv ( becklin , gatley and werner 1982 ; davidson et al .",
    "models of the photodissociation regions in the cnd require an incident flux ( @xmath13 ev @xmath52 ev ) of @xmath53@xmath54 erg @xmath55 s@xmath22 ( wolfire , tielens & hollenbach , 1990 ) , implying a total uv luminosity of about @xmath56 .",
    "this radiation field has a specific photon number density per solid angle @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . here , @xmath60 is the lab - frame photon energy and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are , respectively , the temperature ( assumed to be @xmath63 k ) of the stellar uv component and of the reprocessed cnd radiation , which is assumed to peak at @xmath64 m , corresponding to a characteristic temperature @xmath65 k. the normalization constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 incorporate the dilution in photon number density as the radiation propagates outwards from the central core .",
    "this is calculated assuming that the radiation emanates from a sphere of radius @xmath68 pc for the uv , and that the ir luminosity is @xmath69 from a disk with radius @xmath70 pc .",
    "the calculation of the inverse compton ( x - ray and @xmath3-ray ) emissivity for this known @xmath28 population bathed by the ir and uv radiation is carried out according to what is now a standard procedure ( see , for example , melia , yusef - zadeh & fatuzzo 1998 ) .",
    "the upscattered radiation is emitted isotropically from within a volume @xmath71 pc@xmath72 in sgr a east , corresponding to a shell with radius @xmath73 pc and thickness @xmath74 pc .",
    "the centroid of this structure is assumed to lie at @xmath75 pc behind the nucleus .",
    "the remaining continuum component of importance is bremsstrahlung radiation resulting from the interaction between the relativistic leptons and the ambient ( fixed target ) nuclei ( see koch & motz 1959 ) .",
    "thus , the overall spectrum from sgr a east is a superposition of the @xmath3-rays from @xmath4 decays , synchrotron radiation by the relativistic leptons produced during the decay of the charged pions , bremsstrahlung emission by these electrons and positrons , and their comptonization of the ir and uv radiation from the central @xmath25 pc .",
    "the key result of our calculations is displayed in figure 3 for case 2 above .",
    "the inferred magnetic field is @xmath76 gauss , which is within a factor of @xmath77 of the equipartition value of @xmath34 in sgr a east , assuming a radio luminosity of @xmath78 ergs s@xmath22 arising from relativistic leptons gyrating in a magnetic field over a volume of @xmath79 pc@xmath80 .",
    "the asca measurement is an upper limit , since it does not distinguish between thermal and nonthermal emission from this region .",
    "our predicted hard x - ray spectrum is also consistent with ginga observations , which show evidence of a hard tail in the diffuse x - ray spectrum from the inner region of the galaxy ( yamasaki et al .",
    "1996 ) , and with the current osse upper limits ( purcell et al . 1997 ) . at the highest energy measurement to date , a 270 minute exposure by the whipple observatory produced a small excess ( @xmath8 ) of @xmath81 tev emission from within the egret error box of 2eg j1746 - 2852 , yielding an integrated flux upper limit of @xmath82 @xmath55 s@xmath22 ( buckley et al .",
    "although this signal is at best only @xmath8 above the noise , our calculated spectrum would be consistent with a detection at this level .",
    "case 1 would not produce an acceptable spectrum because the larger ambient proton density ( @xmath83 @xmath36 ) results in a significantly higher lepton bremsstrahlung flux .",
    "the spectral shape would then also not be a good fit to the data since the @xmath3-rays from @xmath4 decays would be swamped by the other radiative components . in fact , we found it very difficult to fit this broadband spectrum with any ambient density in excess of @xmath84 @xmath36 .",
    "this raises an interesting issue , since the energy content in the relativistic protons ( see above ) is then a large fraction ( @xmath85 ) of the energy in a `` standard '' sn burst ( @xmath86 ergs ) . on the other hand",
    ", this relativistic energy content would constitute only @xmath87 of the available energy if the burst that produced the sgr a east remnant was @xmath0 ergs , as suggested by other observations ( see above ) .",
    "our results may therefore be somewhat consistent with the supposition that sgr a east was produced not by a single , standard supernova explosion , but rather by several such events , or a single more catastrophic incident , such as the tidal disruption of a star . in both cases 1 and 2",
    "we adopted a value of @xmath40 within a narrow range close to @xmath77 .",
    "we found our fit to be very sensitive to @xmath40 .",
    "even with the large error bars associated with the vla points , a proton distribution steeper than this produces a steeper lepton distribution , whose synchrotron emissivity does not fit the radio data .",
    "a shallower proton index is , of course , uncomfortably below the theoretical range .",
    "if the @xmath3-rays detected by egret are indeed produced in this fashion , it seems inevitable to us that the upscattered ir and uv photons should result in a significant intensity at intermediate ( i.e. , @xmath88 kev ) energies , as indicated in figure 3 . this flux density ( @xmath89 photons",
    "@xmath55 s@xmath22 mev@xmath22 ) may be above the sensitivity limit ( at @xmath90 photons @xmath55 s@xmath22 mev@xmath22 for a point source ) of unex , a proposed balloon flight instrument ( rothschild 1998 ) .",
    "other than the overall energetics , it appears that the main distinction between sgr a east and the snrs is the intensity of the external radiation upscattered by the relativistic electrons and positrons . whereas the ambient soft photon intensity in the latter is too low to produce an observationally significant spectral component compared to bremsstrahlung ( gaisser , protheroe & stanev 1998 ) ,",
    "the ir and uv radiation from the galactic center does produce a dominant broadband continuum when scattering with the relativistic leptons in sgr a east ."
