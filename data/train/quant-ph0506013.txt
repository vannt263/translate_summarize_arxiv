    "<S> this paper considers the realizability of quantum gates from the perspective of information complexity . since the gate is a physical device that must be controlled classically , it is subject to random error . </S>",
    "<S> we define the complexity of gate operation in terms of the difference between the entropy of the variables associated with initial and final states of the computation . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the gate operations are irreversible if there is a difference in the accuracy associated with input and output variables . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that under some conditions the gate operation may be associated with unbounded entropy , implying impossibility of implementation .    </S>",
    "<S> psfig # 1      in this paper , we consider complexity and realizability of quantum gates from the point of view of information theory . </S>",
    "<S> a gate is a physical system that is controlled by varying some input variables , which are classical . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , such a physical system could implement a variety of operators based on the control variables . </S>",
    "<S> the gate functions may be also implemented by a single physical system that operates sequentially on the qubits in the quantum register . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of the gate will be defined in terms of the entropy associated with its control . from a practical point of view , one is interested in asking how easy it is to control a gate .    </S>",
    "<S> as no analog system can have infinite precision , we investigate what happens if the precision levels at the input and the output are different . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of the gate , defined in terms of entropy , will be examined for the rotation and cnot gates in certain circuits .      </S>",
    "<S> one aspect of gate performance is its accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> researchers on quantum information science have given much attention to the question of errors and their correction [ 1 - 3 ] by drawing upon parallels with classical information . </S>",
    "<S> quantum error - correction coding works like classical error - correction to correct some large errors .    </S>",
    "<S> but the framework of quantum information is distinct from that of classical information . in the classical case </S>",
    "<S> , it is implicitly assumed that there occurs an automatic correction of errors that are smaller than a threshold by means of clipping or by the use of a decision circuit . in the case of quantum information , </S>",
    "<S> the input data is nominally discrete , but in reality its precision can not be absolute in any actual realization . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , unknown small errors in quantum information can not be corrected [ 4 - 5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , proposals for error correction and fault tolerance ( such as [ 6 - 8 ] ) remain unrealistic .    </S>",
    "<S> classical analog computation and quantum processing do have parallels . </S>",
    "<S> in general , fixed errors in gate operation could become irreversible due to actual small nonlinearity of nominally linear elements . </S>",
    "<S> analog computing is not practical to implement because noise can not be separated from useful signal and it accumulates , degrading the system performance in an uncorrectable manner .    </S>",
    "<S> if there were no noise , the practicality of analog computing would depend on the feasibility of the gate implementation over the expected input - output range . </S>",
    "<S> this feasibility must be checked in the context of the limitations on information processing by the gate .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the gate g of figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> it may be assumed that it is a physical system which is controlled by means of some variable . </S>",
    "<S> this control is implemented by choosing a setting on an instrument , and this choice is associated with random error . </S>",
    "<S> if one views the circuit operations to be implemented by the same device transitioning through various states in sequence , then one can determine the distribution of the control variable states , and compute its entropy . </S>",
    "<S> this entropy , when determined for the entire computing circuit , may be taken to represent its complexity .    </S>",
    "<S> information is preserved , therefore one can define the following relationship for the entropy expressions for the input @xmath0 , the gate control information @xmath1 , and the output @xmath2 :    @xmath3    although it is assumed that the variable @xmath0 is discrete , in reality the lack of perfect precision at the state preparation state makes it a continuous variable [ 9 - 11 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of precision may not affect the measurement variables , but it would introduce continuous phase error .    similarly , the output variable @xmath2 has discrete measurement associated with it , but it may come with additional component states and many unknown , continuous phase terms . </S>",
    "<S> this has implications for quantum amplitudes and , consequently , with the probabilities associated with the states .    as an aside , equation ( 1 ) </S>",
    "<S> provides an explanation for the no - cloning theorem . </S>",
    "<S> a gate can not clone a state since this would require the gate to supply information equal to that of the unknown state , which , by virtue of its being unknown , is impossible .    as the variables @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( defined together with associated continuous phase terms ) are continuous </S>",
    "<S> , the classical variable @xmath1 must also be continuous . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy associated with a continuous variable @xmath4 is given by the expression :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the differential entropy :    @xmath7 dz\\ ] ]    and @xmath8 is the precision associated with the variable .    </S>",
    "<S> if the precision is the same at both input and output , the term @xmath9 will cancel out and the differential entropies would be a proper measure of the entropy of @xmath0 and @xmath2 . in other words ,    @xmath10    the entropy associated with h(c ) is the information lost in the computation process and it may be converted to heat according to thermodynamic laws [ 12 - 14 ] . if @xmath11 is non - zero , error - free quantum computation is impossible , since this is associated with loss of information .      </S>",
    "<S> * example 1 . * </S>",
    "<S> consider a gate which multiples the inputs by a fixed constant @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> if the input @xmath0 is distributed uniformly over the interval @xmath13 , then the output @xmath2 is distributed uniformly over @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the differential entropy values of the input and the output are :    @xmath15    @xmath16    assuming the same precision at input and output , the gate needs to supply entropy equal to @xmath17 , which become large as @xmath18 increases . </S>",
    "<S> this supply of entropy will have to be done in terms of interpolation or other processing which can not be perfect .    if @xmath19 , then the output entropy is smaller than input entropy and , therefore , @xmath11 represents loss of information in the output . in effect , the assumption of fixed amplification of a variable with the same absolute precision at the output amounts to a nonlinear , irreversible process . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when a picture is compressed , one can not obtain the original to the earlier precision by amplifying it back . in practical terms , the precision needed for the realization of a universal gate will be unattainable for a variety of reasons : one can not have perfectly linear behavior in an electrical circuit over an unrestricted range . </S>",
    "<S> unrestricted multiplication of a continuous variable is not implementable if the precision remains unchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> in quantum computing , problems that somewhat parallel this above example are the implementation of rotation and cnot gates , two operators that are basic to the computation process [ 15 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the necessarily classical control of the gate is marred by random errors as well as calibration errors .      </S>",
    "<S> * example 2 . </S>",
    "<S> * consider a quantum gate that rotates the input qubit by a fixed angle . </S>",
    "<S> since the input @xmath0 and the output @xmath2 will be distributed uniformly over the same interval @xmath13 , the entropy associated with this gate will be @xmath20 ( as per equation 4 ) as is required by the reversible nature of the assumed quantum evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> but if the precision associated with the measurement and initialization processes at the input and the output is different , then lossless ( or , equivalently , error - free ) evolution can not be assumed .      consider the cnot gate together with a companion hadamard gate . </S>",
    "<S> the errors in the device implementation of the cnot gate may make the gate effectively nonlinear and hence nonunitary . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix values that the device embodies may be different from the nominal ones below :    @xmath21\\ ] ]    for simplicity , we consider a very straightforward situation which does not affect the cnot gate , but where its companion hadamard gate is off the correct value , stuck in the state @xmath22\\ ] ] where @xmath23 .      </S>",
    "<S> * example 3 . * </S>",
    "<S> consider the arrangement of figure 2 , where the stuck gate @xmath24 ( @xmath25 , but its value is known ) is to the left of the cnot gate ; this circuit demonstrates that quantum processing can compute a global property of a function by a single measurement [ 1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> it will be seen that at the output of the cnot gate , the state is :    @xmath26    the state @xmath27 , which is in error , may be passed through the gate @xmath28 $ ] followed by another @xmath24 to yield @xmath29 , which can be transformed to the correct @xmath30 . in this example , the state @xmath31 was not affected by the stuck gate @xmath24 .    when the stuck gate is the lower hadamard gate , as in figure 3 , the state at the output of the cnot gate is :    @xmath32    corresponding to this we have the density function @xmath33 given below :    @xmath34 $ ]    it follows that the reduced density matrix for the state @xmath35 is :    @xmath36 $ ]    therefore , when @xmath37 , @xmath33 is a mixture , and we can not perform any local correction to @xmath38 to obtain the correct product state , for a unitary transformation on a mixture will keep it as a mixture . in other words , this error is not locally correctable .      </S>",
    "<S> * example 4 . </S>",
    "<S> * in the teleportation protocol , an unknown quantum state ( of particle @xmath0 ) is teleported to a remote location using two entangled particles ( @xmath2 and @xmath4 ) and classical information . here , </S>",
    "<S> for convenience , we use the variant teleportation protocol [ 16 ] which requires only one classical bit in its classical information link ( figure 4 ) . but instead of the hadamard operator , we consider @xmath24 to be the rotation operator with angle @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the receiver has a copy of @xmath24 available for local processing , and we would like to estimate what would happen if this copy is not identical to the one used at the transmitting end .    </S>",
    "<S> the state @xmath0 is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are unknown amplitudes , and @xmath2 and @xmath4 are in the pure entangled state @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state of the three particles is :    @xmath44    the sequence of steps in figure 4 is as follows :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> apply chained transformations : cnot on @xmath0 and @xmath2 , followed by cnot on @xmath2 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   apply @xmath24 on the state of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   measure the state of @xmath0 and transfer information regarding it . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .   apply appropriate operator @xmath45 to complete teleportation of the unknown state .    </S>",
    "<S> a simple calculation will show that the state before the measurement is :    @xmath46    therefore , after the measurement , we get either    @xmath47    or    @xmath48    based on whether the measurement was @xmath20 or @xmath49 . assuming that the value of @xmath39 is also communicated to it , </S>",
    "<S> the receiver can recover the unknown @xmath0 probabilistically ; when the value of @xmath39 is @xmath50 , then the inversion is trivially simple .    for simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> assume that the receiver needs to invert @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> he will replicate figure 4 at his end which means that the hadamard gate that he would use would have identical characteristics ( the same precision ) to the one used during the earlier operation . </S>",
    "<S> he would now obtain either    @xmath52    or    @xmath53    similarly , @xmath54 will , in the next iteration , lead to :    @xmath55    or    @xmath56    this procedure may be extended , and the probability of recovering the unknown state @xmath0 can be shown to be given by the tree diagram of figure 5 .    in the first pass , there is a fifty percent probability of getting the correct state , and this probability reduces in further passes ( figure 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of recovering the state @xmath0 is thus : @xmath57    the ability of the receiver to implement the needed transformation will depend on the precision available in its gate control mechanism . if the value of @xmath39 at the sending point is smaller than the precision available to the receiver , then the state @xmath0 can not be recovered .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that as long as the receiver possesses a rotation operator @xmath24 that is identical to the one used at the sending point , there is no need to know the value of @xmath39 and still obtain the unknown state @xmath0 probabilistically , as in expression ( 9 ) .      we have considered the problem of gate complexity in quantum systems . the control of the gate  a physical device  is by modifying some classical variable , which is subject to error . since one can not assume infinite precision in any control system , the implications of varying accuracy emongst different gates becomes an important problem .    we have shown that in certain arrangements a stuck fault can not be reversed down the circuit stream using a single qubit operator , for it converted a pure state into a mixed state .    </S>",
    "<S> we considered the case of the teleportation circuit with the rotation gate stuck at @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath58 , the state @xmath0 collapses to @xmath20 or @xmath49 . when @xmath59 or @xmath60 , one may obtain the unknown state back probabilistically by passing @xmath61 or @xmath54 back through the circuit of figure 4 iteratively </S>",
    "<S> .    </S>",
    "<S> consider two parties , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , who are both presented with the state @xmath61 or @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> if the precision available to one of them is greater than or equal to that of the sender , and that of the other is less , then one of them can recover the state , whereas the other can not .    </S>",
    "<S> it is essential that the entropy rate associated with the quantum circuit be smaller than what can be implemented by the information capacity of the controller </S>",
    "<S> . this perspective may be useful in evaluating proposals [ 17 ] for quantum computing with noisy components . </S>"
