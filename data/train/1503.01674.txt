    "<S> a laterally confined thin elastic sheet lying on a liquid substrate displays regular undulations , called wrinkles , characterized by a spatially extended energy distribution and a well - defined wavelength @xmath0 . as the confinement increases </S>",
    "<S> , the deformation energy is progressively localized into a single narrow fold . </S>",
    "<S> an exact solution for the deformation of an infinite sheet was previously found , indicating that wrinkles in an infinite sheet are unstable against localization for arbitrarily small confinement . </S>",
    "<S> we present an extension of the theory to sheets of finite length @xmath1 , accounting for the experimentally observed wrinkle - to - fold transition . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an exact solution for the periodic deformation in the wrinkled state , and an approximate solution for the localized , folded state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a second - order transition between these two states occurs at a critical confinement @xmath2 . </S>"
