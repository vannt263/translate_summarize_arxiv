    "we have evaluated the latter  @xcite by means of the optical theorem and the so - called @xmath18-valley approximation  @xcite for the relevant @xmath19 forward elastic scattering amplitude in the @xmath18 background .",
    "this method resums the exponentiating final state gluons in form of the known valley action @xmath20 and reproduces standard @xmath2-perturbation theory at larger @xmath18 separation @xmath21 .",
    "corresponding to the symmetries of the theory , the instanton calculus introduces at the classical level certain ( undetermined ) `` collective coordinates '' like the @xmath22-size parameters @xmath23 and the @xmath18 distance @xmath24 ( in units of the size ) .",
    "observables like @xmath8 must be independent thereof and thus involve integrations over all collective coordinates .",

    "the @xmath18-valley action , @xmath36 $ ] , is restricted by conformal invariance to depend only on the `` conformal separation '' , @xmath37 , and its functional form is explicitly known  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that , for all separations @xmath38 , the interaction between @xmath2 and @xmath39 is _ attractive _ ; in particular , the @xmath18-valley action monotonically decreases from 1 at infinite conformal separation to 0 at @xmath40 , corresponding to @xmath41 .    the collective coordinate integration in the cross - section  ( [ sigma ] )",
    "can be performed via _ saddle - point techniques_. one finds @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where the saddle - point solutions @xmath44 and @xmath45 behave qualitatively as @xmath46 thus , the virtuality @xmath47 controls the effective @xmath33-size : as one might have expected intuitively , highly virtual quarks probe only small instantons .",
    "the bjorken - variable @xmath48 , on the other hand , controls the conformal separation between @xmath2 and @xmath39 : for decreasing @xmath48 , the conformal separation decreases .",

    "[ isorho ] , indicating lines of constant @xmath44 ( top ) and of constant @xmath54 ( bottom ) , nicely illustrate the qualitative relations  ( [ qual - exp ] ) and their consequences : the @xmath47 dependence essentially maps the @xmath2-density , whereas the @xmath48 dependence mainly maps the @xmath18-interaction .",
    "fortunately , important information about the range of validity of @xmath2-perturbation for the @xmath2-density and the @xmath18-interaction , in terms of the instanton collective coordinates ( @xmath55 ) , can be obtained from recent ( non - perturbative ) lattice simulations of qcd and translated via the saddle - point relations  ( [ qual - exp ] ) into a `` fiducial '' kinematical region ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "in fact , from a comparison of the perturbative expression of the @xmath2-density  ( [ density ] ) with recent lattice `` data ''  @xcite one infers  @xcite semi - classical @xmath2-perturbation theory to be valid for @xmath57 fm . similarly , it is found  @xcite that the attractive , semi - classical valley result for the @xmath18-interaction applies down to a minimum conformal separation @xmath58 , corresponding to @xmath59 .",

    "thus , it seems to be a question of _ signature _ rather than a question of _ rate _ to discover @xmath2-induced scattering processes at hera .",
    "hence , we turn now to the _ final states _ of @xmath2-induced events in dis .    in fig .  [ typical ]",
    "we display the lego plot of a typical @xmath2-induced event at hera , as generated by our monte - carlo generator qcdins  @xcite .",

    "the partons from the @xmath2-subprocess , on the other hand , are emitted spherically symmetric in the @xmath69 c.m .",
    "the gluon multiplicities are generated according to a poisson distribution with mean multiplicity @xmath70 .",
    "the total mean parton multiplicity is large , of the order of ten .",
    "after hadronization we therefore expect from the @xmath2-subprocess a final state structure reminiscent of a decaying fireball : production of the order of 20 hadrons , always containing strange mesons , concentrated in a `` band '' at fixed pseudorapidity @xmath71 in the ( @xmath71 , azimuth angle @xmath72)-plane . due to the boost from the @xmath69 c.m .",
    "system to the hera - lab system , the center of the band is shifted in @xmath71 away from zero , and its width is of order @xmath73 , as typical for a spherically symmetric event .",
    "the total invariant mass of the @xmath2-system , @xmath74 , is expected to be in the 10 gev range , for @xmath75 , @xmath76 gev .",
    "all these expectations are clearly reproduced by our monte - carlo simulation .",
    "these features have been exploited by experimentalists at hera to place first upper limits on the fraction of @xmath2-induced events to normal dis ( ndis ) events , in a similar kinematical region as our standard cuts  ( [ standard - cuts ] ) : from the search of a @xmath77 excess in the `` band '' region the h1 collaboration could establish a limit of @xmath78 % , while the search of an excess in charged multiplicity yields @xmath79 %  @xcite . the limit from the charged multiplicity distribution has been further improved in ref .",
    "@xcite to about 1 % .",
    "thus , despite of the high rate of @xmath2-induced events at hera , no _ single _ observable is known ( yet ) with sufficient ndis rejection .",
    "a dedicated _ multi_-observable analysis is required .",
