    "the calculation of high order terms in low - energy effective field theories ( efts ) is a difficult task .",
    "nowadays , most interesting observables have been calculated at the second order of the expansion , and the difficulty of these calculations shows little hope for any further expansion . the main problem which restricts",
    "the potential of efts is their non - renormalizability .",
    "the non - renormalizability does not bring any problem , in principle , for the calculation by means of counting schemes for efts , first introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , the rapidly increasing number of low - energy coupling constants ( lecs ) , makes very high order applications practically of little use in general .    nevertheless , there are contributions of the higher order terms which are free from higher order lecs . in particular this",
    "is true for the leading logarithmical ( llog ) contributions .",
    "llogs are not in general dominant for a generic observable . however",
    ", for some observables the llog contribution is dominant . examples of such observables are the generalized parton distributions at small-@xmath3 @xcite and certain @xmath4 scattering lengths @xcite . in addition , the llog terms are of great theoretical interest because they allow us to judge the behaviour of a whole series of corrections in efts .",
    "we therefore consider the calculation of llog terms in efts as an interesting and useful task .    in renormalizable field theories",
    "the llog terms can be calculated to all orders using the renormalization group ( rg ) and ( simple ) one - loop calculations of the beta functions . in efts , as e.g. chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , they can also be calculated using one - loop calculations as was suggested already in @xcite , and proven in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to renormalizable theories , in efts the llog terms can not be obtained simultaneously for all orders , and every order of the perturbative expansion requires an additional calculation .",
    "however , the evaluation of llog terms is considerably simpler than a full calculation . as an example , the full two - loop leading logarithms in bosonic chpt were known long before the full results @xcite .    within bosonic efts",
    "the llogs have been studied extensively .",
    "it has been shown that for efts with massless particles the llog behaviour is described by a closed set of equations with known kernels , which were elaborated in @xcite .",
    "although , the analytical solution of these equations is not known , one can generate numerically the first few hundreds coefficients rather fast , and use the approximate numerical solution in applications .",
    "an example is the exploration of the `` chiral inflation '' of the pion radius within chpt @xcite .",
    "taking into account the mass of the fields allows for non - zero tadpole diagrams , which leads to a rapidly increasing number of equations with the chiral order since one has to consider one - loop diagrams with an ever increasing number of external legs .",
    "therefore , one needs to incorporate new processes at every new order . as a result",
    ", the difficulty of the calculation grows extremely fast with the chiral order . by automatizing the procedure for a large number of processes the llogs",
    "are known up to seven loops for some quantities @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to generalize the methods used for bosonic efts with masses to the nucleon case . as mentioned earlier , it is not only interesting from the theoretical side , but also necessary for the evaluation of nucleon parton distributions at @xmath5 @xcite . in the paper",
    "we present the extension of the rg method of @xcite to nucleon - pion chpt . with its help",
    ", we calculate the llog coefficients for the chiral expansion of the nucleon mass in the heavy - baryon formulation of chpt .",
    "the main results are presented in sects .",
    "[ sec : resultmass ] and [ sec : conjectures ]",
    ". an earlier application of llogs in the nucleon sector was the calculation of the two - loop llog contribution to the axial nucleon coupling constant @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : rgo ] we introduce the concept of renormalization group order ( rgo ) .",
    "this is needed since in the nucleon sector chiral counting and loop counting are not identical .",
    "[ sec : meson ] shows how the rgo concept works in the meson sector and quotes some known results .",
    "[ sec : hb_lagrangian ] introduces the heavy baryon chpt lagrangian in its two most common variants and the different meson parametrizations we have used as a check on our result .",
    "[ sec : general_comm ] shows how the rgo can be used to prove the calculation of the leading logarithms using only one - loop diagrams also in the nucleon sector .",
    "this is then used to calculate the llogs for the nucleon mass in sect .",
    "[ sec : nucl_mass ] .",
    "some technicalities are discussed in sects .",
    "[ sec : propagator ] and [ sec : pole ] .",
    "we then calculate the llogs for the nucleon mass as well as the odd - power next - to - leading logarithms ( nllogs ) in sect .",
    "[ sec : resultmass ] up to four respectively five loops .",
    "the observed regularity in the leading logarithm allows to also calculate the five loop result with a mild assumption .",
    "the llogs , then essentially known to five loops , show a remarkable regularity when rewritten in the physical pion mass .",
    "we conjecture that this regularity holds to all orders and in that case using the known results for the pion llogs we have a result for the nucleon mass llogs up to 7 loops .",
    "this is described in sect .",
    "[ sec : conjectures ] . a short numerical discussion of our results is given in sect .  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the llogs for a general heavy baryon one - loop integral are discussed in app .",
    "[ app : loopintegrals ] .",
    "in this section we present a short , hopefully self - contained , introduction to the renormalization group approach in efts .",
    "our main goal is to present the method of obtaining the dependence of observables on the renormalization or subtraction scale @xmath7 .",
    "the material is presented in a form transparent for the application at higher orders .",
    "more extensive discussions can be found in @xcite . in particular , what we call llogs is the contribution with the highest power of @xmath8 at a given order of the expansion .    to start with ,",
    "we remind the reader that the lagrangian of an eft is the most general local lagrangian satisfying given symmetry properties with a given set of degrees of freedom or fields .",
    "such a lagrangian contains an infinite number of terms . in the absence of additional restrictions ,",
    "every independent operator is multiplied by an unknown coupling constant , usually called low - energy constant ( lec ) .",
    "it is convenient to multiply every operator by the counting parameter @xmath9 to the power which reflects the minimal order of the perturbative expansion the operator contributes to . in this way ,",
    "the constant @xmath9 resembles the coupling constant in a renormalizable field theory as a way to keep track of ( loop ) orders in the expansion .",
    "therefore , an eft lagrangian takes the form @xmath10 the lagrangian @xmath11 we call the lagrangian of @xmath12th @xmath9-order - order . ] and its lecs are consequently called lecs of @xmath12th @xmath9-order .",
    "let us , following @xcite , denote lecs of @xmath12th @xmath9-order as @xmath13 , where the index @xmath14 enumerates independent operators .",
    "in this way , the @xmath12th @xmath9-order lagrangian reads @xmath15 for some low - energy efts , like mesonic chpt , the @xmath9-ordering of operators is in one - to - one correspondence with the chiral ordering .",
    "however , the definition ( [ 1:l = sum l^(n ) ] ) is more general .",
    "it can be applied to any eft , and , even , to renormalizable theories , some examples can be found in @xcite .",
    "we should mention that there is no unique definition of the @xmath9-ordering for a theory .",
    "the only constraint is that the @xmath9-order of an operator should increase with increasing perturbative order .",
    "the choice made is for efts often referred to as the choice of power counting .    the bare lagrangian is now split into a part with renormalized couplings @xmath13 , which depend on @xmath16 , and the counterterms .",
    "the renormalization scale independence of the lagrangian leads to the set of rg equations for the lecs @xmath13 .",
    "these equations are of the form @xmath17 where the beta - function is a polynomial in the lecs and we have indicated explicitly the @xmath16-dependence .",
    "an important point , used later , is that the right - hand side of ( [ 1:dc = beta ] ) contains only combinations of lecs with total @xmath9-order strictly less then @xmath12 .",
    "the general formal solution of the system of equations ( [ 1:dc = beta ] ) is @xmath18 this defines also @xmath19 .",
    "the operator @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 the derivative in ( [ defh ] ) is defined by @xmath22 such that @xmath23 with the help of @xmath20 or @xmath19 , one can obtain the coefficients of the llog for any observable , without actual calculation of loop diagrams , if the beta - functions are already known .",
    "we will demonstrate this explicitly in the next sections .",
    "the crucial property of the operator @xmath20 is that the repetitive action of @xmath20 nullifies any given lec ( or products of lecs ) .",
    "this is the direct consequence of two features of @xmath9-counting .",
    "the first one is that the lowest order couplings , with @xmath9-order equal to zero , have zero beta - function , and therefore @xmath24 .",
    "the second one is that the @xmath25-function of lec @xmath13 , as defined in ( [ 1:dc = beta ] ) , contains only products of couplings with total @xmath9-order lower then @xmath12 .",
    "thus , every application of the operator @xmath20 onto a product of lecs lowers the total @xmath9-order of that product , until it becomes zero .    for future convenience ,",
    "we introduce the concept of renormalization group order ( rgo ) .",
    "a product @xmath26 of lecs has rgo @xmath27 if @xmath28 for a generic in three - flavour bosonic chpt .",
    "this does not invalidate our later use of the rgo . ]",
    "quantity with a tree level contribution of @xmath9-order @xmath12 , the rgo is the same as the maximum loop order that can appear when calculating that quantity to @xmath29 .    in the bosonic efts treated in the earlier works , e.g.@xcite",
    ", there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath9-order and rgo , namely @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the notion of rgo is unnecessary and was not used in these works .",
    "however , such a relation does not hold in general , i.e. lecs of different @xmath9-order can have the same rgo .",
    "for example , in the nucleon chpt , the @xmath9-counting as is related to rgo as @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 $ ] indicates the integer part of @xmath3 ( see detailed discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : general_comm ] ) .",
    "in such a case the use of the rgo concept is convenient .",
    "it is natural to split the beta - function into terms with the same rgo . for the beta - function of a coupling constant @xmath13 with rgo @xmath27 we can write @xmath33 here @xmath30 or @xmath34 $ ] for the two cases mentioned above .",
    "one can show that the part of the beta function with the highest rgo , @xmath35 , contains only contributions from one - loop .",
    "the next part , @xmath36 , contains contributions from one and two - loop diagrams and so on .",
    "thus , the expression for the operator @xmath20 can be ordered by rgo as @xmath37 @xmath38 contains the beta - functions @xmath39 of the coupling constants @xmath13 of rgo @xmath27 . as a consequence , acting with @xmath38 on an expression reduces its rgo by @xmath40 .",
    "in mesonic chpt the choice of @xmath9-counting versus chiral counting relates both as @xmath41 .",
    "the lowest order lagrangian is of the second chiral order and reads @xmath42},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the standard notation @xmath43 here and though the text , @xmath44 is the bare pion decay constant and @xmath2 is the bare pion mass , @xmath45 in the notation of @xcite .",
    "@xmath46 contains the meson fields , a few examples of possible parametrizations are given in ( [ u_param1]-[u_param3 ] ) .",
    "the next order lagrangian @xmath47 is of fourth chiral order .",
    "the absence of odd chiral order lagrangians is guaranteed by lorentz invariance .    in mesonic chpt ,",
    "the generic rgo of a lec @xmath48 is equal to @xmath12 .",
    "the one - to - one correspondence between generic rgo and the @xmath9-order is the result of the absence of odd - chiral - order lagrangians .",
    "any product of lecs is also in one - to - one correspondence with its generic rgo , which is equal to the sum of the lecs @xmath9-orders .",
    "that , in turn , results in the simple ordering of beta - functions : the beta - function @xmath49 contains only @xmath50-loop beta functions .    as an example of using the operator @xmath20 of ( [ defh ] ) to obtain the llog",
    ", we look at the physical pion mass . in order to obtain the physical pion mass",
    "one should solve the equation @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a series of perturbative corrections to the pion propagator .",
    "the expression for @xmath53 has the general form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a dimensionless expression of maximum @xmath9-order @xmath12 .",
    "the first argument of @xmath56 appears only as the argument of logarithms .",
    "we have suppressed the arguments @xmath57 .",
    "note , that @xmath57 can also enter the arguments of logarithms , moreover there can be logarithms of more complicated expressions of it .",
    "such logarithms are not rg logarithms , and can not in general be obtained by any procedure based on rg .",
    "the expression for @xmath53 is renormalization scale independent .",
    "moreover , it is renormalization scale invariant at every chiral order independently : @xmath58 \\sigma^{(n)}_\\pi{\\left(}\\frac{\\mu^2}{m^2},c(\\mu^2){\\right)}= \\left[\\mu^2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mu^2 } + \\hat h\\right ] \\sigma^{(n)}_\\pi{\\left(}\\frac{\\mu^2}{m^2},c(\\mu^2){\\right)}= 0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , we again have as solution , similar to ( [ defr ] ) , @xmath59 choosing @xmath60 , one neglects all the rg logarithms in @xmath55 on the right - hand - side .",
    "thus , all rg logarithms are collected in the action of the operator @xmath19 .",
    "the expression for @xmath55 has the following form @xmath61 where @xmath62 form the tree contribution to @xmath63 .",
    "the symbol @xmath62 denotes here the products of @xmath64 with the highest possible rgo for the product .",
    "the @xmath65 depend on @xmath57 .",
    "the highest power of the rg logarithm @xmath66 in the expression ( [ 2:sigma = r sigma ] ) accompanies the highest power of @xmath20 , in @xmath67 , which gives a non - zero result acting on @xmath63 .",
    "since every action of @xmath20 reduces the rgo of expression , the coefficient of the llog is @xmath68 where nllog is the the acronym for the next - to - leading logarithms , and hence @xmath69 denotes the part of expression without llog .",
    "therefore , constructing the higher chiral order lagrangians , and calculating the one - loop beta - functions of their lecs , one can obtain the ll coefficients without actual calculation of multi - loop diagrams .",
    "moreover , the result is independent on the details of the higher order lagrangians , as long as they are sufficiently general for the process at hand @xcite .",
    "practically it is convenient to use a non - minimal lagrangian generated `` on - the - fly '' by the counterterms to one - loop diagrams only .",
    "this was the approach used in @xcite for the mesonic theory for several processes .",
    "the solution of the pole equation gives us the expression for the physical pion mass to llog accuracy .",
    "it is known up to sixth power of logarithms @xcite and reads @xmath70 where @xmath71",
    "the nucleon - meson chpt in the naive form has the problem of the large nucleon mass @xmath72 .",
    "there are several ways of dealing with the presence of this large scale , each with advantages and disadvantages . in this article , we use the heavy baryon approach to meson - nucleon chpt since in this approach all scales that explicitly appear are soft and there are no divergences nor @xmath16-dependence associated directly with the scale @xmath72 .    for the llog calculation , we have to determine the lagrangians of zero rgo . for the pion - nucleon system , these are lagrangians of the first and the second chiral orders .",
    "the first chiral order lagrangian , neglecting terms with external fields , reads @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a spin vector .",
    "we use the standard notation for the field combinations ( see also the definitions in ( [ 2:u_mu_def ] ) ) : @xmath75    the second order lagrangian is sensitive to redefinitions of the nucleon field .",
    "the most standard form of the second chiral order heavy baryon lagrangian reads @xcite @xmath76n_v.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a different but equivalent version of the second order chiral lagrangian is given in @xcite , and it reads @xmath77n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the relation between the lecs @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the following @xmath80    although the s - matrix elements are independent of the parametrization of the nucleon field , the contributions of individual diagrams , and expressions for the beta - functions are dependent on the field parametrization . therefore , the comparison of results for calculations performed in different parameterizations is a very strong check of a calculation .",
    "the calculations presented in the next sections have been done in both parametrizations of the nucleon field .",
    "additionally for further cross - checks , we used different parameterizations of the pion field @xmath46 .",
    "we have used @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    "the consideration of the llog behavior of nucleon - meson systems is similar to meson systems , but with some additional features .",
    "the main additional feature of meson - nucleon systems is the presence of operators with odd number of derivatives .",
    "therefore , the relation between @xmath9-order and chiral order is @xmath84 for the single - nucleon sector of the chpt lagrangian , and @xmath85 for the meson sector of eft lagrangian . at the same time",
    ", every loop increases the chiral order by at least two .",
    "therefore , the rgo is not in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath9-order .",
    "a lec of @xmath12th @xmath9-order @xmath48 has generically an rgo @xmath86}$ ] .",
    "this has important consequences in the rg and llog structure of the theory .",
    "the first consequence is the contribution of diagrams with different rgo to the same chiral order .",
    "indeed , a loop diagram with several vertices of even chiral order ( i.e. odd @xmath9 order ) has an rgo less then a diagram with the same chiral order but with fewer even - chiral - order vertices .",
    "an example of diagrams with the same chiral order but different rgo is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .        using the relation between chiral order and rgo",
    ", one can see that every two even - chiral - order vertices reduce the rgo of a diagram by one , from the possible maximum .",
    "for example : for any diagram with two even - chiral - order vertices with certain rgos , there exists diagrams of the same chiral order and of the same topology , but with these two vertices replaced by odd - chiral - order vertices , one with a chiral order one lower and one chiral - order one higher .",
    "the lower chiral order has the same generic rgo as the even vertex but the higher chiral order vertex has generic rgo one higher .",
    "the latter diagram has thus a higher rgo .",
    "we conclude that at a given chiral order the highest rgo contribution is given by the diagrams with _ zero or one _ vertex of even chiral order .",
    "the second consequence is the ambiguity of the definition of a leading logarithm .",
    "the natural definition of llogs , the logarithm of a maximum power of @xmath66 at a given chiral order , does not always coincides with the rg definition for the same observable . in sect .",
    "[ sec : nucl_mass ] we will show that in the chiral expansion of the physical nucleon mass , the llog terms of odd chiral order are actually of nllog origin when seen from an rgo perspective .",
    "the physical mass of the nucleon is given by the position of the pole in the dyson propagator . in the heavy baryon approach",
    "the inverse dyson propagator reads ( we remind the reader that superscripts @xmath12 refer to the @xmath9-order of quantities , and that the meson and meson - nucleon sectors of the action have different chiral counting ) @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath40 is the momentum of the nucleon , and @xmath89 is the reference four velocity of the heavy nucleon .",
    "there are some intricacies of defining the propagator and renormalization of the nucleon wave function in heavy baryon theory , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however for the determination of the nucleon mass the straightforward usage of ( [ 5:inverse_prop ] ) is sufficient .",
    "the expressions for @xmath63 are the result of the calculation of one - particle irreducible diagrams with a nucleon line at the @xmath90th chiral order .",

    "the second observation is that the coefficients @xmath163 contains a very particular combination of lecs .",
    "the pattern appearing in @xmath163 is not well understood yet .",
    "let us consider it in detail .    as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : general_comm ] , one can have at most one insertion of the order @xmath164 lagrangian .",

    "the coupling constant @xmath167 or @xmath168 can not enter the nucleon mass at llog since it produces an @xmath169 .",
    "however , we found no simple argument why @xmath6 only appears up to order @xmath170 .    for the powers of @xmath6 , there are two sources for factors of @xmath6 in the loop diagrams , namely from the vertices @xmath171 ( [ 3:l0 ] ) and from the vertices @xmath47 ( [ 3:bkkm]-[3:em ] ) .",
    "while the number of vertices from @xmath47 is restricted to one , the number of vertices from @xmath171 is naturally unrestricted .",
    "moreover , the expression for @xmath172 contains all allowed powers of @xmath6 .",
    "these powers cancels within the solution ( [ 5:mass_sol ] ) .",
    "we have checked that if one introduces new lecs for the terms proportional to @xmath6 in @xmath47 ( say coefficients @xmath173 in front of the first two terms in ( [ 3:em ] ) ) the coefficients @xmath163 would contain higher powers of @xmath6 .",
    "these induced higher powers are proportional to @xmath174 and disappear when @xmath175 . since these operators appear in @xmath47 as the compensation of the non - relativistic nucleon reference frame , we conclude that absence of higher powers of @xmath6 in coefficients @xmath163 is a consequence of lorentz invariance .",
    "supposing that the cancelation of the higher powers of @xmath6 takes place at all orders , one can neglect these powers during the computation of diagrams .",
    "this procedure significantly reduces the demands for computer time and allows us to calculate the coefficient @xmath156 , which is presented in tab .",
