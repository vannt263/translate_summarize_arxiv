    "quantum dots have been studied extensively as low - dimension nanostructures interesting from the intrinsic theoretical point of view and due to their importance to modern electronic devices @xcite .",
    "the most spectroscopy experiments were carried out on quantum dots with soft parabolic confinement potential @xcite .",
    "those parabolic quantum dots attract the attention as simple model systems for electron - electron interaction studies .",
    "although the parabolic quantum dots have some disadvantage due to kohn theorem @xcite which shows that only the center of mass motion usually can be excited ( in absorption and even in tunneling ) , the confining potential in a dot very often is rather close to the parabolic one .",
    "that is why the parabolic dots can serve as a good starting point or the reference for the investigations of more sophisticated quantum dots .",
    "the small nonparabolicity usually helps to reveal peculiarities of the relative electron motion spetrum which is sensitive to the electron - electron interaction .    only in the case of quantum dot with two electrons the exact analytical solution of the eigenvalue problem for the parabolic dot",
    "can be obtained @xcite .",
    "the most of theoretical investigations were mainly based either on some mathematical tricks ( which is possible in the case of parabolic dot with 2 and 3 electrons @xcite ) , or on the straightforward diagonalization of the coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "although the latter gives the exact solution of the problem , due to time consuming calculations it can be applied only in the case of small number of electrons in a dot .",
    "that is why the construction of approximate solutions is of interest .",
    "one of them was demonstrated in @xcite where in the case of high magnetic field rather accurate results were obtained using the moving eckardt frame .",
    "recently it was shown @xcite that some approximate technique based on the renormalized perturbation series can be successfully used for the energy spectrum estimations in a wide coupling constant range . the other technique based on pade approximants @xcite",
    "was shown to be very successful in the case of parabolic dot with small number of electrons .",
    "both of those approximations are based on some interpolating technique between the perturbation series in coupling constant and the asymptotic expansion valid in large coupling constant range .    in the present paper in order to obtain the total picture of energy spectrum , including the ground and some excited states , we performed the proper classification of the asymptotic energy levels paying attention to the symmetry properties of the spin wave function part and constructed the renormalized perturbation series for the energy of quantum dots with 2  5 electrons based on rahter simple two term expansion in both limiting regions of the coupling constant .    the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the problem is formulated and the perturbation series technique is outlined .",
    "the asymptotic series are formulated in section 3 and the spin wave function part for asymptotic region is constructed in section 4 .",
    "the interpolating technique is described in section 5 and in the last section 6 the results for quantum dots with 2  5 electrons are presented and discussed . in appendix a the algebraic expression for coulomb matrix element is given and in appendix b all coefficients which are necesssary for construction of the renormalized perturbation series are collected .",
    "generally the system of @xmath0 electrons in a quasi-2d quantum dot is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath1 +    \\sum_{i < j}^{n } \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon |{\\bi r}_i-{\\bi r}_j|}.\\ ] ] here @xmath2 stands for the effective electron mass , @xmath3 is the static dielectric constant , and @xmath4 is the characteristic frequency of parabolic confinement potential . for the sake of convenience we shall scale the coordinates @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and measure the energies in dimensionless units of @xmath7 . after this transformation",
    "we obtain the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath8 with the single dimensionless coupling constant @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the effective bohr radius ) characterizing the energy spectrum of electrons in the parabolic quantum dot .",
    "the simplest way to solve the eigenvalue problem is just to use the perturbation series in coupling constant @xmath11 @xmath12 the first coefficient is the eigenvalue of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath13 and can be presented as the sum of noninteracting electron energies @xmath14 where @xmath15 labels the one electron quantum number set .",
    "the first order correction @xmath16 can be estimated in a standard way ( see , for instance @xcite ) and presented as a sum of two - electron coulomb matrix elements @xmath17 where the one electron wave functions can be expressed in associated laguerre polynomials @xmath18 for numerical estimation of the coulomb matrix element ( [ meleme ] ) we used the analogue of girvin and jach expression @xcite which is given in [ aps1 ] .    when calculating the first order correction the main problem is the degeneracy of zero order energy levels because the good quantum numbers of the total angular momentum @xmath19 and the total spin @xmath20 are not sufficient for classification of energy levels .",
    "that is why we used numerical diagonalization of the degenerate blocks of the above first order correction matrix .",
    "the obtained results  the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath16 are collected in [ coeff ] .",
    "in the @xmath22 case the kinetic energy of the electron system is small if compared to the potential one .",
    "it is known that such systems are strongly correlated and show tendency for wigner crystallization @xcite .",
    "monte carlo results for classical particles in the parabolic dot @xcite show that the particles crystallize in some structure of concentric rings . when the number of electrons in a dot is small @xmath23 they fall into a single ring on which the electrons are located equidistantly and separated by the angle @xmath24 .",
    "the quantum dynamics of such a wigner crystal can be described by means of the rotation and vibration modes .",
    "the general theory of vibration modes is given in @xcite .",
    "it is based on introducing the moving eckardt frame and the diagonalization of the vibrational hamiltonian in the harmonic approach . in the case of small number of electrons located on a single ring",
    "the vibrational hamiltonian and the problem of its diagonalization can be essentially simplified by representing the electron coordinates as complex variables @xmath25 and turning them to the local electron coordinates on the ring by means the following transformation @xmath26 here @xmath27 labels the electrons on the ring .",
    "we shall follow the simpler way restricting our consideration by the following two term asymptotic expansion @xmath28 the first term of it can be easily obtained minimizing the potential in ( [ bedim ] ) .",
    "the minimization leads to the equilibrium ring radius @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 ) which corresponds to the main term @xmath31 in the asymptotic energy expansion .",
    "the next term in expansion ( [ eksp ] ) corresponds to the ring oscillations . to obtain it we insert ( [ coord ] ) into hamiltonian ( [ bedim ] ) and expand the potential into @xmath32-series .",
    "it leads to the following second order correction to the equilibrium potential @xmath33 where @xmath34+z_m\\left[1-\\e^{i\\alpha(m - n ) }    \\right ] }    { 4\\sin^2[\\alpha(n - m)/2 ] } \\equiv \\gamma_{n - m}.\\ ] ] now let us apply the fourier transform @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the vibration modes . inserting it into the above potential expression and subsequently into ( [ bedim ] ) after simple but laborious transformation we obtain the following expression for the asymptotic hamiltonian with the second order potential corrections @xmath37 where @xmath38 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "they can be diagonalized in a standard way just introducing the proper variables .",
    "let us separate the real and imaginary parts of the initial variables , and introduce the new variables in the following way @xmath41 in these variables every hamiltonian ( [ hamz ] ) part @xmath39 splits into two terms .",
    "the first term is @xmath42 while the other part @xmath43 can be obtained just replacing @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "both @xmath46 have the same eigenvalues that can be found by the diagonalization of the symmetric matrix @xmath47 which defines the quadratic form of the potential term , and leads to the following expression for the eigenfrequencies @xmath48 ^ 2 + 4[b_k+b_{-k}]^2}}.\\ ] ] thus , since the transformed hamiltonian corresponds to the set of independent harmonic oscillators the corresponding vibration wave function @xmath49 can be constructed in a standard way introducing the `` phonon '' creation @xmath50 and annihilation @xmath51 operators @xmath52 the `` vacuum '' state @xmath53 corresponds to the system ground state , and the symbol @xmath54 stands for polarization .",
    "for the interpolation purposes it is important to know the wave function symmetry properties with respect to the rotation of the electronic ring as a whole .",
    "let us denote this operation by operator @xmath55 .",
    "it is evident that the ground state is invariant under that operation , i.  e. @xmath56 . as the above rotation is equivalent to the substitution @xmath57 it follows from expression ( [ fourier ] ) that @xmath58 . due to the mixing of both @xmath40 modes the operators @xmath59 and wave function ( [ wfvib ] ) obey more complicated symmetry condition",
    "however , because of the degeneracy of obtained vibration states it can be essentially simplified using the proper superposition of the eigenstates of both hamiltonian parts @xmath46 .",
    "so , we shall assume that the wave function superposition of this sort is constructed , and consequently the phonon operators obey the symmetry condition @xmath60 we shall use the above symmetry condition for the classification of obtained asymptotic vibration modes whose frequencies @xmath61 are collected in .",

    "the mode @xmath68 corresponds to the ` breathing ' mode for @xmath69 and to the rotation of the ring as a whole for @xmath70 .",
    "the last case should be considered separately . actually , in the harmonic approximation used the rotation mode is separated from the vibration modes .",
    "its eigenfunction is @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is an angle determining rotation of the ring as a whole ) and the corresponding energy is @xmath73 .",
    "it is seen that in the case of large angular momenta @xmath19 this term becomes essential and thus it should be included into the main asymptotic energy term , and consequently it leads to the equilibrium ring radius dependence on the total angular momentum @xmath19 ( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "however , the above term is of order @xmath74 and lies beyond the ( [ eksp ] ) approximation . hence considering the states with small @xmath19 only we neglect this rotation mode correction ( and the ring radius dependence on @xmath19 as well ) together with the anharmonicity corrections which are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we should keep in mind , however , that there are many states labeled by different @xmath19 values corresponding to every asymptotic vibration term .",

    "contrary to line @xmath137 the line @xmath138 is located in the finite region of the @xmath136-plane ( @xmath142 ) , and that is why the energy @xmath143 can be successfully expanded into @xmath62-series . adjusting the above series to the @xmath11-series ( [ perturb ] ) in the region @xmath144 and to the asymptotic expansion ( [ eksp ] ) in the region @xmath22 we obtain the final expression for the renormalized series @xmath145 the expansion coefficients can be expressed in terms of those in ( [ perturb ] ) and ( [ eksp ] ) as @xmath146 as we restricted ourselves with the two term approximation in both ( [ perturb ] ) and ( [ eksp ] ) expansions we introduced the additional adjustable parameter @xmath147 ( as proposed in @xcite ) for improving the interpolating accuracy . the geometric meaning of that parameter is clear from  it indicates the rotation angle of the mapping line @xmath138 around the point @xmath19 to which the energy @xmath148 is always mapped .",
    "the rotation changes the relative contributions of the @xmath11-series and the asymptotic expansion to the renormalized series .",
    "the value @xmath149 corresponds to the full control of the renormalization procedure by the @xmath11-series and the value @xmath150 to that of the asymptotic expansion .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that usually the energy exhibits some plateau as a function of the parameter controlling the mapping line ( @xmath147 in our case ) . when the number of terms in the @xmath11-series is increased that plateau shows the tendency to increase , too , thus giving a good reason for the controlling parameter choice . in the energy at the fixed point @xmath151 as a function of the parameter @xmath147 is shown by the solid line in the case of the first excited triplet state of the two electron system . as our @xmath11-series are rather short we have no prominent plateau . however , some curve twist is present , and we hope that it is a rather good idea to choose the controlling parameter @xmath147 somewhere between the max and min points .",
    "the difference of energy values corresponding to those points can serve as an estimation of the interpolation accuracy .",
    "we see that the accuracy is of about 1% .",
    "we used the inflection point of @xmath148 versus @xmath147 curve for the controlling parameter @xmath147 choice . the energy value obtained with that choice",
    "is shown by dashed line in . comparing it with the exact result which is known for two electron case ( dotted line )",
    "we see that the accuracy is even better than 1% .",

    "we should note that according to @xcite the same parameter values can be used for constructing the renormalized series in the case when the additional magnetic field @xmath152 is applied in the direction perpendicular to the quantum dot plane . in that case",

    "note that there is a misprint in ( 5.4 ) of @xcite .",
    "the last term added in ( [ energy_mag ] ) corresponds to the zeeman energy where @xmath156 is the effective @xmath157 factor and @xmath158 is the bohr magneton .",
    "as an illustration of the introduced renormalization technique we present in figures [ fig3][fig6 ] the excitation energy versus @xmath11 plot for the relative electron motion for the quantum dot with 25 electrons .",
    "the inclusion of the center of mass motion energy is a trivial one .",
    "one should just shift up the presented spectra by the some integer value , as the center of mass motion is not affected by the electron interaction .",
    "the main problem is to decide how the terms in both regions ( @xmath159 and @xmath22 ) should be interconnected . taking into account the fact known in quantum mechanics that two terms with the same good quantum numbers never cross each other we used the simplest term connection scheme . starting from the ground state we connected successively term in the region @xmath159 to the lowest possible unconnected term with the same @xmath19 and @xmath20 quantum numbers in the asymptotic region .    in figures",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] the energy plot for the system of two and three electrons are presented . the terms with the zero energy exceeding the ground state energy by 3 and 2 ,",
    "correspondingly , are depicted . in the case of four and five electrons",
    "the energy plots are given in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "the degeneracy of the states grows rapidly with the number of electrons and thus here we present only the two lowest terms tending to each of asymptotic vibration states .",
    "the asymptotic terms in the above figures are labeled by the numbers in parenthesis along right axis which indicate the @xmath131 values of the phonons present in the state . the phonon state with polarization corresponding to the larger frequency",
    "is indicated by prime .",
    "it can clearly be seen how the term structure transforms from that of the weakly interacting quantum system , where the energy levels are governed by filling of noninteracting single electron states to the semiclassical strongly correlated system , where the energy levels correspond to the electronic ring vibration frequencies .",
    "such switching of the dot behaviour can be explained by simple dimensional considerations .",
    "namely , the three terms in hamiltonian ( [ basic_ham ] ) can be estimated as @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 . equating them we define the critical @xmath11 value @xmath163 where the above mentioned switching occurs .",
    "this is in agreement with our energy dependencies .",
    "as the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath164 the above estimation leads to some condition for confinement potential frequency showing whether the dot behaves like quantum system or the classical one .",
    "when the confinement potential is mainly caused by some positive neutralizing charge located on the rather distant gate the increase in confinement potential frequency @xmath4 does not exceed @xmath0 @xcite . in that case increasing of the number of electrons in a dot leads to more classical system .    as an illustration of the presented renormalized series technique in the case with magnetic field ( according to ( [ energy_mag ] ) ) we calculated the ground state energies vs. magnetic field for 2  5 electrons which are displayed in figures [ fig7 ] ( a)(d ) .",
    "the curve ( a ) for two electron system is in good agreement with that presented in @xcite ( we choose the parameters as in @xcite and also include the fictitious gate charge but do not subtract the zero point motion of the center of mass ) .",
    "it is seen from figures [ fig7 ] ( b)(d ) that increasing the number of electrons the structure of the dependencies becomes less resolved and the peaks lose their sharpness .",
    "thus we miss a tiny additional peak in the position marked by an arrow in figure [ fig7 ] ( b ) which is present in data of exact diagonalization .",
    "comparing our results with those obtained in @xcite , say , for @xmath165 , @xmath166 t , @xmath98 , @xmath167 we obtained ground energy value @xmath168 mev and find a good coincidence which proves that the approximate separation of rotation and vibration modes works fairly well for small angular momenta .",
    "concluding we would like to mention that the parabolic quantum dot due to the softness of the confinement potential is rather favourable object for constructing the interpolating expressions in the contrary to the hard wall dot @xcite where the accuracy is much worse .",
