    "the lattice formulation of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is presently considered as the only first principle tool to investigate a transition between the confined and deconfined states of strongly interacting matter .",
    "such a phase transition ( pt ) is also expected in a pure non abelian su(n ) gauge theory which is known as gluodynamics .",
    "the svetitsky - jaffe hypothesis [ ] relates the deconfinement pt in ( d+1)-dimensional su(n ) gluodynamics to the magnetic pt in the d - dimensional z(n ) symmetric spin model .",
    "the key element of this correspondence is that the role of spin in the original su(n ) gluodynamics is played by the so called polyakov loop .",
    "the latter is interpreted as the time propagator of an infinitely heavy static quark . a high level of understanding of the spin systems along with the svetitsky - jaffe hypothesis led to a significant progress in studies of the su(n ) gluodynamics properties in the pt vicinity .",
    "formation of geometrical clusters composed of the polyakov loops is an important feature of the pure gauge theories [ , ] .",
    "a similar phenomenon is well known in spin systems and it is responsible for percolation of clusters . moreover , the deconfinement pt in gluodynamics already was studied within the percolation framework in refs . [ , ] , where the main attention was paid to the largest and the next to the largest clusters whereas the smaller clusters were ignored . however , in many respects the pt details are encoded in the properties of smaller clusters which is well - known after formulating the fisher droplet model ( fdm ) [ ] .",
    "an important finding of the fdm is that at the critical point the size distribution of physical clusters obeys a power law which is controlled by the fisher topological exponent @xmath0 .",
    "hence the value of this exponent is rather important in order to develop a consistent theory of pt in strongly interacting matter and to localize the critical point of qcd phase diagram which is a hot topic of the physics of heavy ion collisions .",
    "therefore , in this work we study the geometrical clusterization in su(2 ) gluodynamics and analyze the properties of clusters of all possible sizes .",
    "such an approach allows us to explain the deconfinement of color charges as a specific kind of the liquid - gas pt [ ] .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "in this contribution we present a novel approach to study the deconfinement pt in the su(2 ) pure gauge theory in terms of the geometrical clusters composed of the polyakov loops of the same sign .",
    "we demonstrate that the separation of ( anti)clusters into  liquid \" droplet and  gas \" of smaller fragments is well justified and reflects the physical properties of the lattice system .",
    "this concept allows us to explain the deconfinement pt as a special kind of the liquid - gas transition .",
    "however , in contrast to the ordinary liquids , the su(2 ) gluodynamics contains two types of liquid whose behavior is drastically different in the region of broken global z(2 ) symmetry .",
    "the cluster liquid droplet evaporates above pt whereas the anticluster liquid droplet experiences the condensation of the accompanying gas of anticlusters .",
    "a successful application of the ldf to the description of the size distributions of gaseous ( anti)clusters is the main result of this study .",
    "surprisingly , even the monomers are qualitatively described by eq .",
    "( [ eqii ] ) .",
    "the fit of the ( anti)cluster size distributions by the ldf formula allows us to determine the @xmath2-dependences of the reduced chemical potential and the reduced surface tension coefficient .",
    "while in the symmetric phase this quantities are identical for fragments of both kinds , their behavior is drastically different in the deconfined phase .",
    "another important finding of this study is a high precision determination of the fisher topological constant @xmath3 which is the same both for clusters and for anticlusters .",
    "this result is in line with the exactly solvable model of the nuclear liquid - gas pt [ ] . at the same time it disproves the fdm prediction that @xmath4 [ ] .",
    "we showed that the reduced surface tension coefficient and the mean size of the largest ( anti)cluster can be used as the new order parameters of deconfinement pt in su(2 ) gluodynamics .",
    "in contrast to the fdm the power law for the size distribution is found only for the gas of clusters and not at the pt point , but at @xmath5 .",
