    "quantum criticality is currently being pursued in a number of strongly correlated materials ranging from intermetallic rare earth compounds to insulating magnets and even engineered systems .",
    "this interest is spurred in part by the observation that unconventional superconductivity commonly occurs near quantum critical points , as well as by mounting experimental evidence of the inadequacy of the traditional theoretical approach to continuous transitions at absolute temperature @xmath7 .",
    "this approach , commonly referred to as the spin - density - wave or hertz - millis - moryia picture , is based on an extension to zero temperature of landau s theory of order - parameter fluctuations.@xcite the evidence for the breakdown of the spin - density - wave picture is particularly compelling in the context of intermetallic rare - earth compounds near an antiferromagnetic instability .",
    "as a result , a major thrust in the quest for a theoretical framework of critical phenomena beyond the landau - ginzburg - wilson paradigm has centered around the question of how kondo screening can be destroyed at a @xmath7 magnetic - ordering transition .",
    "an extensively discussed alternative to the spin - density - wave picture is local quantum criticality,@xcite in which kondo screening itself becomes critical precisely at the magnetic - ordering transition . in the vicinity of such a kondo - destruction quantum critical point ( qcp ) ,",
    "scaling properties of the order parameter are very different from those predicted by spin - density - wave theory .",
    "for example , inelastic neutron - scattering experiments have shown that the dynamical spin ( order - parameter ) susceptibility exhibits frequency - over - temperature ( or @xmath5 ) scaling , and displays a fractional exponent in the frequency and temperature dependences over a wide - range of momentum space.@xcite in addition , hall measurements have provided evidence that the single - particle relaxation rate is linear in temperature,@xcite a behavior that arises naturally from @xmath5 scaling of the single - particle green s function .",
    "a microscopic model of local quantum criticality in heavy - fermion metals has been provided@xcite through extended dynamical mean - field theory , which maps the kondo lattice model to a single magnetic impurity coupled to both a fermionic conduction band and to one or more bosonic baths representing collective spin fluctuations . the critical point in the lattice model",
    "is then captured in terms of a critical destruction of the kondo effect in the single - impurity problem .",
    "such a construction gives rise to a qcp that is spatially local but has interacting critical modes in imaginary time , and that correctly captures @xmath5 scaling in the order - parameter susceptibility .",
    "while the full extended dynamical mean - field treatment simulates the lattice through self - consistent determination of the band and bath densities of states , valuable insight can be gained by studying kondo - destruction qcps in pure impurity problems .",
    "this work investigates the quantum - critical destruction of the kondo effect in pseudogap variants of the ising - symmetric ( or easy - axis ) bose - fermi anderson ( bfa ) and bose - fermi kondo ( bfk ) models . in each model , a local degree of freedom couples to a band of conduction electrons having a density of states that vanishes as @xmath0 on approach to the fermi energy ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the local degree of freedom is also coupled via the @xmath8 component of its spin to a bosonic bath having a density of states proportional to @xmath9 for frequencies up to some cutoff @xmath10 ( i.e. , for @xmath11 ) .    in the presence of a metallic conduction band ( corresponding to an exponent @xmath12 ) ,",
    "the bfa and bfk models with a sub - ohmic bosonic bath characterized by a bath exponent @xmath13 feature a second - order quantum phase transition ( qpt)@xcite between a kondo - screened ( fermionic strong - coupling ) phase and a localized ( kondo - destroyed ) phase in which the bosons asymptotically suppress spin - flip scattering and a residual impurity moment survives to @xmath7 . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the ising - symmetry bfa and bfk models are thought@xcite to share the same critical properties as the corresponding sub - ohmic spin - boson model , which features an interacting qcp characterized by critical exponents that vary continuously with the bath exponent @xmath15 .    in the absence of the bosonic bath , by contrast , the pseudogap bfa and pseudogap bfk models reduce , respectively , to the pseudogap anderson and pseudogap kondo models , in which the depression of the low - energy density of states impedes the formation of a many - body kondo screening cloud and gives rise to qpts@xcite between a kondo phase and a localized phase in which the impurity exhibits a free spin-@xmath16 at @xmath7 .",
    "the qpts in the pseudogap anderson and kondo models belong to the same universality class@xcite and are described by critical exponents that vary with the band exponent @xmath17 .",
    "the pseudogap versions of the bfa and bfk models offer fascinating possibilities for nontrivial interplay between two different mechanisms for destruction of the kondo effect ; an interplay that we investigate in this work .    an su(2)-symmetric version of the pseudogap bfk model ( in which the cartesian components of the impurity spin couple to different bosonic baths sharing the same exponent @xmath15 ) has been studied via perturbative renormalization - group ( rg ) methods,@xcite while the ising - symmetric case of bosonic coupling to the @xmath8 component of the impurity spin has been the subject of preliminary investigation using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg).@xcite a spinless variant of the model ( coupling the impurity charge to a bosonic bath ) has been addressed by perturbative and numerical rg techniques.@xcite in all these previous studies , the order - parameter susceptibility has been found to exhibit an anomalous @xmath18 variation in the quantum - critical regime with an exponent @xmath19 independent of the band exponent @xmath17 .",
    "one of the objectives of the present work is to investigate more carefully the universality of this observation .",
    "another motivation for the present study is to expand our understanding of the conditions that lead to @xmath5- or dynamical scaling of critical correlation functions near unconventional quantum criticality .",
    "it is well known that a quantum impurity model with a bulk component that is conformally invariant can be described by a boundary conformal field theory.@xcite in any such theory , a conformal mapping can be used to obtain correlators at temperatures @xmath20 from their @xmath7 counterparts .",
    "in particular , the zero - temperature two - point correlator of a primary conformal field @xmath21 with scaling dimension @xmath22 exhibits a power - law decay @xmath23 .",
    "this gives rise , via a conformal mapping , to the scaling form@xcite @xmath24 the fourier transform of eq .   can be performed analytically and yields a function of @xmath25 that can be analytically continued to real frequencies provided@xcite that @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , demonstration that a system obeys eq .   with @xmath26 is sufficient to show the presence of @xmath5 scaling , a characteristic feature of interacting qcps .    in the pseudogap anderson model ,",
    "the conduction - band density of states breaks conformal invariance , while in the metallic ( @xmath12 ) bfk model , the conduction band is conformally invariant but the bosonic bath is not .",
    "nonetheless , local correlators of each model have been found@xcite to exhibit a boundary conformal scaling form in imaginary time , consistent with eq .  ;",
    "such properties have been attributed to an enhanced symmetry at the qcps .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the scaling form eq",
    ".   also applies to the critical correlators of the pseudogap bfa and bfk models , where the densities of states of the fermionic and bosonic baths both break conformal invariance in the bulk .",
    "we address these issues through a combination of techniques . for the particle - hole - symmetric pseudogap bfa model",
    ", we use a continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) method,@xcite which stochastically samples a perturbation expansion in the anderson hybridization , to probe static and dynamical quantities .",
    "we also use the bose - fermi extension of the nrg method@xcite to resolve the critical spectrum and extract static critical exponents of the pseudogap bfk model .",
    "our results show that the two models are in the same universality class .",
    "we find that within different ranges of the exponents @xmath17 and @xmath15 , the measured critical exponents are determined by the fermionic band alone , by the bosonic bath alone , or by both the fermions and the bosons .",
    "we show that both the single - particle green s function and the local spin susceptibility obey the scaling form of eq .   with exponents @xmath27 , proving that each correlator obeys @xmath5 scaling in both the quantum coherent ( @xmath28 ) and the relaxational ( @xmath29 ) regimes .",
    "agreement with nrg results for static quantities confirms the ability of the ct - qmc approach to study quantum - critical properties of models involving bosons .",
