    "the analysis of jet@xmath10 events uses a sample of events with one or two high @xmath11 jets and large @xmath12 , with angular cuts to suppress events with two back - to - back jets ( multi - jet background ) .",
    "the dominant remaining background is @xmath13 in association with jets , which is indistinguishable from the signal process of @xmath14+jets .",
    "the estimation of the background at large @xmath12 is problematic in simulated samples , due to the difficulties of accurately modeling the many sources of @xmath12 .",
    "the experimental results , therefore , rely on data - driven background estimates , typically extrapolating the @xmath15 contribution from @xmath16 events with large @xmath7 boson @xmath11 .    in this study , we begin from experimentally reported values  @xcite of the background estimates and signal efficiencies ( at @xmath17 tev , @xmath18 fb@xmath19 , @xmath20 gev ) , and use simulated samples to extrapolate to higher center - of - mass energies , where no data is currently available . at the higher collision energies and instantaneous luminosities of the proposed facilities , the rate of multi - jet production will also be higher , requiring higher @xmath12 thresholds to cope with the background levels and the trigger rates .",
    "we generate signal events as well as events for the dominant background @xmath15+jets in madgraph5  @xcite , with showering and hadronization by pythia  @xcite . in each case",
    ", we generate events with zero or one hard additional colored parton and use the mlm scheme to match the matrix - element calculations of madgraph5 to the parton shower evolution of pythia .      in the case of each potential facility , we must choose a @xmath12 threshold for the analysis .",
    "for a given threshold at a specific facility , estimating the sensitivity of the jet+@xmath12 analysis requires    * the dark - matter signal efficiency * an estimate of the @xmath15+jets background * the uncertainty of the @xmath15+jets background .    for the signal efficiency , we modify the reported experimental efficiency at @xmath17 tev  @xcite to estimate the efficiency at a higher @xmath12 cut . the estimated signal",
    "yield @xmath21 for a facility with center - of - mass energy @xmath22 and integrated luminosity @xmath23 is    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the published signal efficiency . in each case , the efficiency @xmath26 of a @xmath12 threshold is measured at parton - level using the simulated samples , see fig .",
    "[ fig : met ] , and the cross sections @xmath27 are leading order .    in the case of the background estimate",
    ", we extrapolate from the reported background estimate , denoted @xmath28 , by scaling with an extrapolation factor @xmath29 :    @xmath30    where @xmath29 is    @xmath31    accounting for the relative efficiency of a higher @xmath12 cut and larger background cross sections at increased center - of - mass energies .",
    "the relative uncertainty on the background @xmath28 is scaled from the reported relative uncertainty , @xmath32 , using the extrapolation factor @xmath29 as given above :    @xmath33    + jets ) and background ( @xmath15+jets ) samples generated at @xmath347 , 14 , 33 and @xmath35 tev with thresholds of 80 , 500 , 1000 and 4500 gev , with @xmath36 gev . ]",

    "given the expected background and uncertainties , we use the cls method  @xcite to calculate expected 90% confidence limits on contributions from new sources . together with the estimated signal efficiencies , we calculate cross - section limits .",
