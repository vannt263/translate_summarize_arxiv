    "antiferromagnetically interacting spin systems with a low dimensional structure often show a ground state unexpected from a classical picture .",
    "this is due to a quantum spin fluctuation , which destabilizes the n@xmath7el state and tends to bring the system to the non - magnetic state such as the haldane state or the singlet dime state .",
    "the title compounds ( ch@xmath0)@xmath1chnh@xmath0-cucl@xmath0 and ( ch@xmath0)@xmath1chnh@xmath0-cubr@xmath0 abbreviated as ipa - cucl@xmath0 and ipa - cubr@xmath0 are low - dimensional spin - gap systems with an isomorphic crystal structure  @xcite . the origin of the spin gap is quite different for these two compounds . in cl - system , which has recently been revealed by an inelastic neutron experiment to be a spin ladder@xcite , the most dominant coupling on the neighboring two spins with @xmath8=@xmath9 on the rung leads a formation of a ferromagnetic dimer .",
    "these fake @xmath8=1 spins interact weakly with antiferromagnetic bonds along a ladder , so that the system is well considered as the haldane system , that is , @xmath8=1 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain  @xcite .",
    "the spin excitation gap in this system is reported to be around 10k  @xcite .",
    "while in br - system , the dominant interaction between the two neighboring spins is antiferromagnetic , so that at low temperatures , they form a non magnetic dimer , which interacts weakly with other dimers .",
    "the spin excitation gap is reported to be around 80 - 100k  @xcite .",
    "though these two cl and br systems look quite different , one should notice that the underlying physics is the same in that the two have a gapped ground state .",
    "the subject of this study is to investigate what will happen when these two non magnetic systems with quite different spin - spin couplings are mixed . in a classical picture",
    ", one should note that a uniform antiferromagnetic ordering is instable against bond randomness , and that a spin - glass state is favorable .",
    "this is because ferromagnetic bonds embedded randomly in antiferromagnetic bonds randomly reverse the staggered phase factor of the antiferromagnetism , and hence destabilize it .    in the quantum mechanical picture , however , the effect of randomness is not self - evident . disorder usually breaks the order , but sometimes it brings order to disorder@xcite . for example",
    ", it is well known that doped holes of only three percent destroy the n@xmath7el order in high-@xmath10 cuprates  @xcite .",
    "this is explained in terms of the frustration effect . in spin peierls systems , on the contrary",
    ", an extremely small fraction of non magnetic impurities causes the antiferromagnetic order by destructing singlet dimers  @xcite . in the present system , where there is neither a frustration effect nor a destruction of a dimer",
    ", we expect a novel - type impurity effect .",
    "so far , investigations on macroscopic quantities such as uniform magnetization and specific heat on ipa - cu(cl@xmath11br@xmath3)@xmath0 have shown that there exists a phase transition in the limited range of the mixing ratio @xmath4=0.44 - 0.87  @xcite . from a uniaxial anisotropy in",
    "the magnetization observed below a certain temperature , they claim that an antiferromagnetic - like ordering takes place at low temperatures .",
    "the dependence of the transition temperature on the mixing ratio indicates that there exist the two quantum critical points , and that both the two are of the first order .    as a theoretical approach",
    ", nakamura has studied the @xmath8=@xmath9 ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic random alternating heisenberg quantum spin chain by a quantum monte - carlo method to show that a uniform antiferromagnetic state is stable in a certain region of @xmath4 , and that there exists a quantum phase transition at the edge of the region  @xcite .",
    "he also claims that the quantum effect is indispensable to the occurrence of the uniform antiferromagnetic ordering . on the other hand ,",
    "fisher and his colleagues had worked on the lattice boson system by introducing a randomness to the onsite chemical potential , and predicted the appearance of the new ground state , bose - glass phase at the absolute zero  @xcite .",
    "it has been well known that the field - induced or thermally - excited triplets in spin gap systems including the present compound can be treated as nearly - free bosons  @xcite , and that their theory is believed to be applicable to disordered spin gap systems .",
    "in fact , their prediction is supported by recent experiments on a solid solution of other two spin gap systems tlcucl@xmath0 and kcucl@xmath0 , on which a possibility of the existence of the bose - glass phase has been reported@xcite .    in this paper , we report by a microscopic probe of @xmath12sr an extensive study on the spin state in the two samples with mixing ratios @xmath4=0.80 and 0.95 , which are in and out of the ordering region  @xcite .",
    "we expect that this experiment will be of help for understanding the quantum effect of disorder in spin gap systems .",
    "single crystals of ( ch@xmath0)@xmath1chnh@xmath0cu(cl@xmath2br@xmath3)@xmath0 with @xmath4=0.85 and 0.95 have been grown by an evaporation method from isopropylalcohol solution of ( ch@xmath0)@xmath1chnh@xmath13hx and cux@xmath1 with x = cl , br.@xcite a mixing ratio @xmath4 in crystals is determined by the icp method .",
    "the outer shape of crystals is a rectangular - solid .",
    "following manaka _",
    ", we refer the orthogonal three planes on the outer shape of crystals as a , b , and c - plane  @xcite .    before the muon experiments",
    ", macroscopic quantities of the single crystals were measured to confirm their quality and homogeneity .",
    "the specific heat of the sample @xmath4=0.85 measured by the thermal relaxation method shows a cusp at @xmath14@xmath1512k , which agrees with manaka s report .",
    "the uniform magnetization also shows a significant anisotropy below this temperature , suggesting an existence of a phase transition .",
    "no spurious curie - term is observed at low temperatures down to 2k in either the two samples .",
    "these observations are quantitatively consistent with manaka s results  @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath12sr have been carried out at riken - ral muon facility in u. k. using a spin - polarized pulsed surface - muon ( @xmath16 ) with a momentum of 27mev/@xmath17 .",
    "the two single crystals with @xmath4=0.85 and one with @xmath4=0.95 were used for muon measurements .",
    "they are attached by an apiezon n grease on the silver plate with a purity of four nines , connected at the bottom of the cryostat .",
    "a typical size of crystals are 10@xmath182@xmath1820mm@xmath19 .",
    "the incident muon beam is perpendicular to c - plane of the crystals .",
    "the sample temperature was controlled by oxford @xmath19he cryostat in the range of 0.3 - 14k .",
    "the typical temperature stability during measurements is @xmath2010mk above 1.5k , and @xmath202mk below 1.5k .",
    "figure 1 shows the profile of zf ( zero - field ) muon rotation spectra of the sample @xmath4=0.85 .",
    "a clear rotation is observed at low temperatures .",
    "a short time region within 1@xmath12sec of relaxation curves is fit to the function @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are fitting parameters , corresponding to an inhomogeneity of the local field , a mean value of the local field , and a phase constant .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath23 is shown at fig .",
    "2 , where a scaling function @xmath25 is fitted to the data to obtain the transition temperature @xmath5=11.65(@xmath200.05)k and the critical exponent @xmath6=0.33(@xmath200.02 ) . the local field of the muon site at 0.33k",
    "is estimated to be @xmath26=@xmath27=360 oe . when the rotating frequency becomes close to the pulse width of the muon beam 70nsec / fwhm ,",
    "the oscillating amplitude is appreciably decreased at low temperatures . assuming the shape of the muon pulse as to be gaussian , we have calculated the convolution and found that the amplitude should decrease to be 65% , which is comparable to the observed value of 50% .",
    "this reduction is due to the effect of a finite pulse width of the muon burst rather than the change in the electronic spin state .",
    "the relaxation rate @xmath22 is around 5 - 7@xmath12sec@xmath28 in the ordered state , and shows a slight increase below 6k .",
    "the distribution of the internal field is @xmath29=@xmath30=130 - 160oe .    in fig .",
    "3 , we show relaxation curves under various longitudinal fields ( lf ) up to 10oe . in paramagnetic state at 14k , the asymmetry change in the entire zf curve is approximately 8% .",
    "the early part of curves within a few micro seconds shows the gaussian decay , indicating that the muon relaxation is caused by nuclear spins , which create a quasi static field around muon sites .",
    "this is confirmed by the observation that the weak lf of 100oe completely suppresses the relaxation .    when the temperature is lowered to 11.8k , which is higher than @xmath5 only by 0.15k , no sign of critical slowing down is observed , that is , the relaxation curve is identical to those in the paramagnetic state as seen in fig .",
    "1 . below @xmath5 , as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "3 , the initial asymmetry is drastically reduced by the large internal field due to the magnetic ordering . a very slow component of relaxation persists at the lowest temperature 0.33k .",
    "this relaxation is considered to be caused by a quasi static nuclear spin fluctuation , because it is easily suppressed by a weak lf of 10oe .",
    "the zf - asymmetry change due to this nuclear spin component is 4% , which is almost a half of that in paramagnetic state at 14k .    , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are fitting constants . ]",
    "next , we proceed to the results on the sample with @xmath4=0.95 , which shows no anomalies both in the specific heat and the macroscopic susceptibility at low temperatures down to 2k .",
    "figure 4 shows typical muon relaxation curves under lf up to 3900oe . in 10k",
    ", entire muon relaxation is driven by the quasi static nuclear spin fluctuation , because an initial part of the relaxation decays with gaussian - like function , and hence the relaxation is completely suppressed by a weak lf of a few tens oe .    in 0.33k ,",
    "the relaxation is divided into the two components .",
    "one is the quasi static nuclear spin part , which has the gaussian form , and is suppressed by a weak lf of 20oe .",
    "the other is a dynamically - fluctuating electronic part , which has the lorentzian form , and survives relatively high a field up to 3900oe .",
    "the relaxation rate @xmath22 was obtained by fitting the exponential function to the relaxation curves under lf above 20oe .",
    "the fraction of the latter components is around one half of the entire asymmetry , indicating that , roughly speaking , a half of the muons are not affected by any electron spins .",
    "( open square ) and relaxation rate @xmath22 ( solid square ) .",
    "the curve is the scaling function @xmath31 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the n@xmath7el temperature and the critical exponent .",
    "the two parameters are obtained by the least square method to be @xmath5=11.65k and @xmath6=0.33(@xmath200.02 ) ( _ inset _ ) , which is close the value for 3d - ising model . a fitting line with the exponent of 3d - heisenberg model @xmath6=0.367 is also shown for comparison . ]    the external field ( lf ) dependence of @xmath22 shown at fig .",
    "5 directly maps the fourier component of the fluctuating field produced by 3@xmath32-spins .",
    "assuming that the spin fluctuation of 3@xmath32-spins has a classical lorentzian spectrum , we fitted the function @xmath33 to the observed data to obtain the mean fluctuation time and the fluctuation amplitude to be @xmath34=0.44@xmath12sec and @xmath29=55 oe . the temperature dependence of @xmath22 under lf of 100oe , which is high enough for a complete suppression of the effect of nuclear spins , is shown in fig .",
    "a significant increase that looks to be diverging at the zero temperature is observed below 5k .",
    "here we mention that in both the two samples with and without a static order , approximately half of the muons are relaxed by the local field produced by 3@xmath32-spins .",
    "this means that the other half only feel the local field produced by nuclear spins , fluctuation of which is quasi static , or by the 3@xmath32-spins fluctuating with frequency out of the muon time window .",
    "we will discuss this point in the following section .",
    "= 0.85 at paramagnetic state ( upper panel , 14k ) and ordered state ( lower panel , 0.33k ) under various longitudinal fields ( lf ) up to 100oe . ]",
    "the muon spin rotation observed at low temperatures @xmath35=11.65k indicates the existence of the long - range and static magnetic order in the sample of @xmath4=0.85 . judging from the single fourier component observed in the rotational profile ,",
    "the spin structure is considered to be simple antiferromagnetic .",
    "this result microscopically demonstrates that the solid solution of the two spin gap systems has a magnetic ground state .",
    "the critical exponent of the order parameter @xmath6=0.33 agrees with the theoretical value of 3d - ising model  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the three dimensional exponent is explained as that the phase transition in this low dimensional spin system is set off by weak inter - ladder interactions , the path of which runs three - dimensionally in the system .",
    "the ising - type universality class is consistent with the existence of the effective uniaxial anisotropy @xmath36 due to the formation of ferromagnetic dimers in ipa - cucl@xmath0 , reported recently by manaka@xcite .",
    "next , we discuss the volume fraction of the magnetic order . as stated above , half of the muons are not affected by the local field produced by 3@xmath32-spins in both the two samples .",
    "this observation indicates the two possibilities .",
    "one is that there are the two muon stopping sites .",
    "the first site is , as in many other compounds , located near the negative ions of cl@xmath37 or br@xmath37 , which are close to cu-3@xmath32 spins , and bears a large local field . actually , if we assume that the ordered moment is around 1 @xmath38@xcite , and that its interaction with muon is of a classical dipole - dipole type , the distance between the muon site and the cu atom is calculated from the observed local field of 360 oe to be 0.3 - 0.37 nm , which is comparable with that between cl and cu atoms 0.22 - 0.23 nm , supporting our idea .",
    "the second site may be located , for example , around or inside the anion molecule ( ch@xmath0)@xmath1chnh@xmath0 , which is far from 3@xmath32-spins , and its local field should be very small . by considering this second site , we can understand why the half of muons are not affected by the magnetic field produced by 3@xmath32-spins even though the volume fraction of the magnetic order is nearly unity .",
    "the other possibility is that half of the muons only experience electronic moments fluctuating outside the muon time window .",
    "we emphasize here that the possibility of the phase separation in samples is excluded , because the sample quality is assured both by the macroscopic susceptibility containing no spurious curie - term , and by the sharpness in the phase transition observed by the specific heat and by the present muon experiment ( fig .",
    "2 ) . furthermore , if half the volume of the sample @xmath4=0.85 is contaminated by other concentration which do not shows magnetic order ( @xmath390.87 ) , the half of the contaminating region is expected to show an appreciable relaxation due to the dynamical spin fluctuation as is observed in the sample @xmath4=0.95 .",
    "this contradicts to the observed fact .",
    "the profile of the relaxation curves in the paramagnetic state does not change from one at high temperatures until the temperature reaches at @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the temperature region where the critical slowing down of 3@xmath32-spins , if exists , starts and its characteristic frequency gets into the muon time window ( @xmath40sec@xmath28 ) must be extremely narrow , that is , @xmath410.1k . on the other hand ,",
    "the sample of @xmath4=0.95 shows a diverging behavior of @xmath22 toward the absolute zero , indicating that a critical slowing down of the spin fluctuation takes place in rather a wide range of temperature , though there is no long range order at low temperature down to 0.33k .",
    "this sample of @xmath4=0.95 has been indicated to be gapped by the results of macroscopic measurements of manaka s group  @xcite and also of the present study .",
    "nevertheless , the present muon observation clearly demonstrates that the system has the magnetic instability in the ground state .",
    "we can immediately identify the dominant q - part of this instability to be antiferromagnetic like , because the uniform susceptibility vanishes at low temperatures . in regard to the origin of the magnetic instability , we propose the two possibilities .",
    "one is the precursor effect to the bose - glass phase at the absolute zero  @xcite . in solid - solution of the two spin - gap systems ( tl , k)cucl@xmath0 , an anomalous enhancement of @xmath22 as well as nmr-@xmath42",
    "have been reported and the possibility of the bose - glass phase is suggested.@xcite the other possible origin is the fluctuation effect around the quantum critical point at @xmath4=0.87 , which divides the area into the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic regions . in the samples",
    "@xmath4=0.95 , though the static order does not occur , the antiferromagnetic component of @xmath43 may be highly enhanced .",
    "this is analogous to the case of high-@xmath10 cuprates of the superconducting phase , where a pronounced antiferromagnetic fluctuation in 3@xmath32-spins persists , even though there is no magnetic order at finite temperatures .",
    "@xcite finally , we do not deny a possibility of the long - range order in this sample at a finite temperature much lower than the present study .",
    "the experiment in the temperature region of dilution - refrigerator is now on the progress .",
    "by an intensive @xmath12sr study on the solid solution of two spin - gap systems ( ch@xmath0)@xmath1chnh@xmath0-cu(cl@xmath2br@xmath3 ) ( @xmath4=0.85 , 0.95 ) , we have confirmed that the sample @xmath4=0.85 shows a long range magnetic order at @xmath5=11.65k .",
    "the local field at muon site is 360oe at the lowest temperature .",
    "the critical exponent estimated from the temperature dependence of the local field is @xmath6=0.33 , which agrees with the theoretical value of 3d - ising model . in the sample of @xmath4=0.95 , which does not show any long range order , a significant critical slowing down of the electron spin fluctuation toward the absolute zero was observed . the characteristic correlation time and fluctuation amplitude of the 3@xmath32-spin fluctuation at 0.33k",
    "was obtained as 0.44@xmath12sec and 160oe .     in the sample @xmath4=0.95 under longitudinal field ( lf ) of 100oe .",
    "the inset shows the profile of spectra at each temperatures .",
    "each spectrum other than that for 0.33k is shifted vertically by 1% .",
