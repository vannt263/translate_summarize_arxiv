    "numerical simulations and analytical work have shown that the gravitational amplification of small density fluctuations leads to a wealth of structures resembling the observed large - scale distribution of galaxies .",
    "the resulting mass density distribution can be thought of as a `` cosmic web '' @xcite characterised by the presence of structures with different dimensionality .",
    "most of the volume resides in low - density regions ( voids ) which are surrounded by thin denser sheets of matter .",
    "a network of filaments of different sizes and density contrasts departs from the sheets and visually dominates the mass distribution .",
    "dense clumps of matter lie at the intersections of filaments . from the dynamical point of view , matter tends to flow out of the voids , transit through the sheets and finally accrete onto the largest clumps through the filaments .    in a universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) , this description applies only after coarse - graining the density distribution on scales of a few mpc . on smaller scales ,",
    "the power in the primordial spectrum ends up producing a hierarchical distribution of ( virialised ) dark - matter haloes whose positions trace the large - scale structure described above . according to the current cosmological paradigm , galaxies form within these haloes .",
    "astronomical observations show that galaxy properties in the local universe vary systematically with environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a fundamental step towards understanding galaxy formation it is thus important to establish how the properties of dark - matter haloes depend on the environment in which they reside .",
    "a first attempt in this direction was made by @xcite who found that mass is the only halo property that correlates with environment at variance with concentration , spin , shape and formation epoch . using marked statistics , @xcite found evidence that haloes of a given mass form earlier in dense regions .",
    "higher resolution simulations confirmed this finding and helped to better quantify it as a function of halo mass and redshift @xcite . at the same time",
    "it has become clear that also other halo properties as concentration and spin correlate with local environment @xcite .    although the large - scale structure of matter is prominently reflected in the halo distribution , no efficient automated method has been proposed to associate a given halo to the dynamical structure it belongs to .",
    "most of the environmental studies mentioned above use the local mass density within a few mpc as a proxy for environment . in this paper",
    "we follow a novel approach and associate dark - matter haloes to structures with different dynamics .",
    "_ voids _ , _ sheets _ , _ filaments _ and _ clusters _ are distinguished based on a stability criterion for the orbit of test particles which is inspired by the zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "our method is accurate , fast , efficient and contains only one free parameter which fixes the spatial resolution with which the density field has to be smoothed ( as in the evaluation of the density ) .",
    "we show that any classification based on local density is degenerate with respect to ours which we regard as more fundamental .",
    "we find that _ all _ halo properties at zero redshift show some dependence on the dynamical environment in which they reside .",

    "particle positions and velocities were saved for 30 time - steps logarithmically spaced in expansion parameter @xmath23 between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "virialised dark - matter haloes were identified using the standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with a linking length equal to @xmath26 times the mean inter - particle distance .",
    "we only considered haloes containing at least 300 particles , since virtually all of the halo properties we investigated show strong numerical artefacts when measured for less well resolved haloes .",
    "we found 13353 , 16296 and 21041 of such haloes for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath22 , respectively .",

    "as this quantity is not well defined for fof groups , we took @xmath55 to be a fraction @xmath56 of the maximum distance between a halo particle and the centre of mass . to accommodate possible fuzzy boundaries of the haloes , we chose a value of @xmath57 .",

    "the median spin @xmath62 is roughly 10 per cent higher for haloes with only 100 particles than for haloes consisting of more than 300 particles .",
    "we use a simple stability criterion from the theory of dynamical systems to distinguish between haloes residing in clusters , filaments , sheets or voids . consider a test particle moving in the peculiar gravitational potential , @xmath63 , generated by a cosmological matter distribution frozen in time ( e.g. no hubble drag ) .",

    "we can thus linearise the equation of motion at the points @xmath65 and find the linear system @xmath67 where the tidal field @xmath68 is given by the hessian of the gravitational potential @xmath69 thus the linear dynamics near local extrema of the gravitational potential is fully governed by the three ( purely real , as @xmath68 is symmetric ) eigenvalues of the tidal field tensor .",

    "we solve poisson s equation using a fast fourier transform on a grid of twice the particle resolution ( @xmath77 grid cells ) .",
    "the density field @xmath76 is obtained by using cloud - in - cell interpolation of the particles onto the grid and then smoothed using a gaussian kernel @xmath78 . in this case , the smoothing length , @xmath71 , and the mean mass contained in the filter , @xmath79 , follow the relation @xmath80 to solve poisson s equation on the grid , we apply the green s function @xmath81 of the symmetric 5-point finite difference operator that we later use to compute the tidal tensor .",
    "altogether , we hence find the solution for the smoothed gravitational potential through the double convolution @xmath82 we then apply the second derivative operator to @xmath83 and get the diagonal components of the tidal tensor . for the off - trace components , we apply twice the symmetric first derivative operator in the corresponding coordinates .",
    "although the second derivative operator can not be produced from applying twice a symmetric first derivative operator , following this scheme ensures that the trace coincides with the smoothed overdensity to machine accuracy , while the off - trace components are indeed symmetric and are not suffering from a spurious self - potential . finally , we compute the eigenspace structure of the tensor at each halo s centre of mass .",
    "our criterion for determining the halo environment contains one free parameter , namely the smoothing radius of the gaussian kernel , @xmath71 .",
    "this corresponds to the typical length - scale over which we determine the dynamical stability of the orbits .",
    "the particular choice of @xmath71 directly affects the local eigenstructure and thus changes the classification of environment .",
    "smoothing on the scale of single haloes picks out each single halo as a stable cluster in the sense of the definition . in figure",
    "[ fig : structurefraction ] we show how the choice of @xmath71 affects the fraction of the simulated volume classified in the four categories .",
    "these fractions continuously vary with @xmath71 , which implies that some haloes change their classification . for @xmath84 mpc ,",
    "the density field becomes approximately gaussian , and we observe convergence to the theoretical volume fractions of 42 per cent for sheets and filaments , and 8 per cent for voids and clusters ( doroshkevich 1970 , see also shen et al .",

    "table [ matrix ] lists the fraction of the total number of haloes that are assigned to the 16 possible classifications with the two smoothing scales .",
    "the halos that contribute to the off - diagonal elements of this `` transition matrix '' typically live in regions where the tidal field has one nearly vanishing eigenvalue . in these transition regions ,",
    "a modification of @xmath71 can easily change the sign of this eigenvalue and thus the association of the corresponding halo to its environment .",
    "this results from using sharp boundaries ( positive vs negative eigenvalues ) to classify the different environments .",
    "note that only a negligible fraction of the haloes inverts the sign of more than one eigenvalue of the tidal field when the smoothing scale is changed , indicating that our classification is indeed physical . based on figure",
    "[ fig : transitionobjects ] , we conclude that the combined use of two ( or more ) smoothing scales can be used to classify a larger variety of environments with respect to the basic four that can be found with a fixed resolution , and in particular to identify boundary regions that bridge between the basic four types . we will explore this potentiality of the orbit - stability method in future works .",
    "for simplicity , in this paper we only consider a single smoothing scale , @xmath87 mpc ( corresponding to @xmath88 ) which provides startling agreement between the outcome of the orbit - stability criterion and a visual classification of the large - scale structure .",
    "the resulting classification of halo environments is highlighted in the top - left panel of figure [ fig : transitionobjects ] using different colours . for @xmath87 mpc ,",
    "the volume fractions occupied by voids , sheets , filaments and clusters are , respectively , 13.5% , 53.6% , 31.2% and 1.7% .",
    "this suggests that we identify as voids just the inner parts of the most under - dense regions ( see also figure [ fig : densitystat ] ) and consider as sheets the volume - filling regions around them . at the same time",

    "@xcite have recently shown that the halo spin parameter increases significantly after a major merger , and relaxes to more standard values after 1 - 2 gyr .",
    "the formation redshift of a halo , as defined in section [ sec : nbody ] , is a good indicator for the occurrence of major mergers .",
    "low formation redshifts correspond to recent major mergers , while high values of @xmath34 denote less violent accretion histories .",
    "figure [ fig : lambdazform ] shows the median spin parameter as a function of @xmath34 for two mass - bins .",
    "we find that , in all environments and mass ranges , the median @xmath130 is a decreasing function of @xmath34 . at the same time , for a given @xmath34 , the spin parameter shows an important environmental dependence : low - mass haloes tend to spin faster if they reside in clusters while massive haloes tend to spin slower in this environment .",
    "the haloes with the largest spin parameter ( median @xmath145 ) are low mass haloes @xmath146 that reside in clusters and have @xmath147 . however , for fixed @xmath34 haloes in clusters have higher median @xmath130 compared to the other environments .       and @xmath148 .",
    "the dotted grey lines indicate a random signal.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    do halo spin directions retain memory of the cosmic web in which the haloes formed ? both filaments and sheets have a preferred direction given by the structure of the eigenspace .",
    "while filaments are one - dimensional structures with a preferred direction in space , sheets are two - dimensional and can thus be uniquely described by their normal vectors . using the definition in section [ sec : classbasic ] these directions",
    "are given by the unit eigenvector @xmath149 corresponding to the negative eigenvalue of the tidal field tensor for filaments and the positive eigenvalue for sheets .",
    "one can therefore compute the degree of alignment between the angular momentum vector of a halo and the respective eigenvectors of the environment in which it resides , @xmath150 .",
    "figure [ fig : am - filament - alignment ] shows the distribution of alignments between halo angular momentum and both filament direction and sheet normal vector in the two mass - bins @xmath151 and @xmath152 . for haloes in filaments we find only a weak trend for their angular momenta to be aligned with the filament direction .",
    "haloes in sheets , however , show a very strong tendency to have their angular momentum parallel to the sheet .",
    "similar correlations are also found in walls delimiting voids @xcite , and might be reflected in the distribution of galactic disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we did not detect any strong correlation with eigenvectors of the other environments .",
    "the presence of alignments between large - scale structures and halo spins could produce a coherent alignment of galaxy shapes and thus generate a systematic contamination in weak lensing maps of cosmic shear ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we next compute correlations of the intrinsic angular momentum of each halo with both the intrinsic angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum of neighbouring haloes residing in the same environment .",
    "we define the spin - spin correlation function as @xcite : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the intrinsic angular momentum of each halo , and the average is taken over all pairs of haloes which are separated by a distance @xmath155 and reside in the same environment class .",

    "we find a significant correlation only for haloes with @xmath159 in cluster environments .",
    "these haloes have a strong tendency to have their spin vectors anti - parallel to the spins of haloes within a distance of a few mpc .",
    "all other correlations are essentially consistent with a random signal . the results for haloes with masses @xmath160 are fully consistent with those for the lower mass bin and therefore not shown in the plots . regarding the alignment of spin and orbital angular momenta ,",
    "the results , given in figure [ fig : amam_jl ] , show a much stronger signal and a clear dependence on environment .",
    "we find an evident tendency for the two angular momenta to be _",
    "parallel _ regardless of mass and environment .",
    "remarkably this correlation significantly extends out to @xmath161 mpc in all environments and is most prominent for smaller haloes in clusters and massive haloes in filaments .",
    "we have presented a new method to classify dark - matter haloes as belonging to four different environments : _ clusters _ , _ filaments _ , _ sheets _ and _ voids_. this scheme computes the dimensionality of the stable manifold for the orbits of test particles by simply looking at the number of positive eigenvalues of the local tidal tensor .",
    "the algorithm contains only one free parameter : the smoothing radius for the gravitational potential .",
    "this quantity fixes the length - scale over which the stability of structures is determined and can be fine tuned to optimise the classification . at the same time , combining the results obtained adopting two or more different smoothing scales allows us to select regions with particular properties in the large - scale structure ( e.g. transition regions between the basic four environments ) .",
    "our classification scheme correlates with local density so that the densest regions are always associated with clusters and the emptiest with voids .",
    "however , our method retains more information on the local dynamics and a simple halo classification based on density will unavoidably mix our populations up .",
    "we have used the classification scheme to study how the properties of isolated dark - matter haloes depend on the environment in which they reside at @xmath25 .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows .    _",
    "1 ) halo shapes _",
    "* massive haloes with @xmath162 do not show any significant dependence of their shape on environment .",
    "* less massive haloes in clusters are less spherical and more oblate than in other regions but the trend is generally weak compared with the intrinsic scatter .",
    "_ 2 ) halo formation times _    * for the whole halo population ( not split by environment ) we found a very strong correlation between median formation redshift and halo mass .",
    "a fit to this relation which holds for halo masses between @xmath163 is given in equation ( [ eq : fitmasszform ] ) .",
    "this dependence is a direct consequence of hierarchical structure formation . * for @xmath146 haloes of fixed mass in the four environments",
    "have significantly different mass assembly histories .",
    "in particular , cluster haloes tend to be older while void haloes younger .",
    "all this hints at mechanisms that suppress the growth of lower mass haloes in clusters and lead to an enhanced survival rate of fossil haloes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a possible explanation ) .",
    "* analytic fitting formulae for the dependence of the median formation redshift on halo mass and environment are given in section [ sec : formationtimes ] .",
    "_ 3 ) halo spins _    *",
    "the median spin parameter of all haloes is the highest in clusters followed in order by filaments , sheets and voids .",
    "this dependence , presumably , has its origin in the tidal - torque history of the haloes which likely correlates with the specific eigenstructure of the tidal field at the final halo position @xcite .",
    "* this trend is reversed for massive objects .",
    "haloes with @xmath159 in clusters are less rapidly spinning than in filaments .",
    "* on the other hand , for smaller masses , haloes in clusters generally possess higher spin parameters than in the other three environments . as these rapidly spinning haloes have also the most recent formation time , we conjecture that the high spin tail is generated by recent major mergers that bias the distribution towards rapid rotation .",
    "hence , the high - spin tail of unrelaxed haloes overlaps the distribution of quiescently evolving haloes which is best fit by a log - normal distribution .",
    "_ 4 ) alignment of halo spins and large - scale structures _    * haloes in sheets show a strong tendency for their spin vector to lie in the symmetry plane of the mass distribution .",
    "this effect is present for all haloes but it becomes much more prominent for haloes with @xmath164 .",
    "* for haloes in filaments , there is a slightly enhanced probability to find their angular momentum orthogonal to the filament direction , independently of mass . *",
    "no other significant correlation has been detected ( but we suffer from small - number statistics in voids ) .",
    "_ 5 ) spatial correlations between halo angular momenta _    * significant spin - spin correlations have been only detected for massive haloes in clusters . in this case , haloes in close pairs ( separations smaller than a few mpc ) show a weak tendency to have antiparallel spins .",
    "* alignments between spin and orbital angular momentum , however , were found to be much stronger .",
    "regardless of mass and environment , spins of haloes in close pairs tend to be preferentially parallel to the orbital angular momentum of the pair .",
    "this strong effect is even enhanced for low - mass haloes in clusters and massive haloes in filaments .",
    "our study has revealed that a number of halo properties depend on environment .",
    "this shows that our dynamical classification is physical and represents a first step towards understanding how the galaxy formation process is influenced by large - scale structures .",
    "we will further explore the potential of this method in future work .",
    "oh acknowledges support from the swiss national science foundation . all simulations were performed on the gonzales cluster at eth zurich , switzerland .",
    "we are very grateful to olivier byrde for excellent cluster support .",
    "while our paper was under consideration for publication , an interesting related work by @xcite appeared as a preprint ."
