    "1 ( b ) shows that there are two phase shift extrema as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "the one we do not use , between the spectator and line resonances , is less sensitive to detuning , but it would increase the rate of unintentional transfer out of the qubit basis . this is partly because there are many more spectator atoms than targets ; the small amount of off - resonant transfer would get multiplied by a much larger number .",
    "in addition , there can be atoms that see a fraction of the intensity that most line atoms see , due to misalignment of beams relative to the lattice or beam profile imperfections ; this can put their resonances closer to the phase shifting microwaves .",
    "to ensure operation near the phase shift extremum , we find it necessary to adjust the intensities of the addressing beam in a target specific way .",
    "this corrects for beam profile distortion by the mems mirror steering system and for the finite rayleigh range of the addressing beams near their foci .",
    "the deviation of the cross atom resonance , 1.8@xmath6 , from 2@xmath6 ( see fig . 1 ( a ) ) occurs because the zeeman shift due to the bias b - field is not very much larger than the addressing beams vector light shifts .",
    "thus when there is only one addressing beam , the quantization axis tilts slightly toward its propagation direction .",
    "our rb building block .",
    "these are the microwave pulses corresponding to a pg / cg pair .",
    "the red pulse is the pg .",
    "the cg is inside the dashed rectangle : the blue pulses are @xmath59 , the black pulses form the spin - echo type structure and the purple pulses are off - resonant microwaves that induce phase shifts .",
    "all the pulses have a blackman profile . ]",
    "we choose randomized benchmarking ( rb ) to characterize the performance of our gate instead of quantum state tomography for several reasons : it can distinguish gate errors from spam errors ; it has less resource overhead and is easily scaled to multi - qubit systems ; and it reflects the fidelity of a group of operations that is not biased by a particular kind of gate .    the basic building block of an rb sequence is a pg - cg pair executed on two target atoms . a cg is a @xmath84 rotation about the @xmath85 or @xmath86axis on the bloch sphere .",
    "it contains one phase gate @xmath37 sandwiched by two global @xmath87 rotations .",
    "a pg is implemented as a global @xmath88 rotation ( about the @xmath85 or @xmath86axis ) or the absence of one ( for the identity or a rotation about @xmath89 ) . for the @xmath90 rotation , we frame - shift all successive microwave pulses .",
    "we extend the spin - echo type structure to include the pauli pulses , as shown in supplementary fig .",
    "1 . the @xmath59 and the pauli pulses are at the rephasing points in this spin - echo type structure .",
    "while the main purpose of the echo @xmath3 pulses is to cancel the crosstalk due to addressing beams and microwave pulses , they also serve to preserve the qubit in the face of inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "moreover , their phases can be adapted to mitigate microwave power errors , as described in the next section .",
    "we have used separate measurements to isolate the factors that contribute to the spam error : collisions with background gas atoms ( 3@xmath34 ) , imperfect state transfer from @xmath91 to @xmath20 ( 2@xmath34 ) , and imperfect clearing ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the sum of these expected terms matches the measured @xmath81 from rb .",
    "generally , there are two types of microwave transition imperfections : power and frequency errors .",
    "our passively stabilized microwave source limits our power stability .",
    "we effectively measure it by driving atoms with up to 65 @xmath3-pulses and find the average fractional error to be @xmath93 .",
    "the source of frequency errors in our system is the inhomogeneous broadening of the ensemble of atoms ( @xmath23130 hz ) due to vibrational excitation .",
    "although , this is too small to affect the fidelity of individual microwave pulses at the @xmath83 level , state evolution between pulses affects our error cancellation scheme .",
    "various techniques have been developed in nmr for dealing with such errors , including composite pulses @xcite , and dynamical decoupling@xcite .",
    "composite pulses from the bb1 family can be made insensitive to imperfect pulse amplitude and pulses from the corpse families can be made insensitive to frequency errors . since neither does both , and they come at the cost of considerably longer pulse durations , they are not suitable for our purpose .",
    "we instead implement phase cycling schemes in which the errors introduced by microwave pulses are cancelled by subsequent pulses .    before tackling the more complicated case of a random sequence of clifford and pauli gates ,",
    "let us consider a simple spin echo sequence , a repeating sub - cycle of torque vector directions given by : \\{@xmath94 } on the bloch sphere .",
    "dephasing from any initial state is controlled , unlike with simpler schemes or the widely used xy class of pulses @xcite , which do nt have a perfect cancellation in the absence of inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "inhomogeneous broadening compromises error cancellation , but phase cycling still greatly improves the performance . in supplementary fig .",
    "2 we demonstrate the performance of this pulse scheme .",
    "supplementary fig .",
    "2 ( a ) plots the spin echo fringe with 100 @xmath3 pulses with phase cycling , with the dashed lines marking the maximum population .",
    "the almost lossless fringe contrast confirms the high fidelity of this spin - echo type structure .",
    "supplementary fig .",
    "2 ( b ) plots this contrast versus microwave rabi frequency .",
    "it is clear that this pulse scheme is quite robust against power fluctuation .",
    "while this pulse scheme works nearly perfectly in a set of four , its implementation in an rb sequence is interrupted when there is a @xmath59 pulse or a pauli pulse ( see supplementary fig .",
    "1 ) . we have empirically determined the following rules for choosing the right phase when the `` phase flow '' is interrupted :    1 .",
    "the spin echo @xmath3 pulses around successive pauli pulses ( see supplementary fig . 1 ) should follow the cycle : \\{@xmath95}. 2 .",
    "if the pg preceding a cg has a torque vector along the same axis as the cg s @xmath59 pulse , then the torque vector of the first @xmath3 pulse inside the cg should be opposite that of pg .",
    "otherwise , it can have the same phase as the @xmath59 pulse .",
    "3 .   the final four @xmath3 pulses in a cg should follow the cycle : \\{@xmath94}.    these rules are based on experimental testing with many randomized benchmarking sequences and phase schemes , but they may not be optimal .",
    "the fidelity for data in fig .",
    "2 . is calculated as follows .",
    "the qubit state takes the form of @xmath96 @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the polar and azimuth angles on a bloch sphere , and @xmath100 represents a spherically symmetric shrinkage of the bloch sphere .",
    "we measure the population in @xmath12 . after a detection @xmath101 pulse with a phase @xmath102 scanned",
    ", the population has a sinusoidal dependence on @xmath102 : @xmath103 .",
    "we first normalize the results by the maximum / minimum population ( 0.95/0.01 ) , which is set by the spam error , and then fit the curve to the above functional form , enabling us to reconstruct the qubit state after the gate operation .    the fidelity in the fig .",
    "inset is determined as follows .",
    "we fix all the qubit state parameters to the theoretically perfect values ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) , except for @xmath99 , which is determined by the @xmath106 gate .",
    "since both the fidelity @xmath51 and the population in @xmath12 are a function of @xmath99 , a relation between @xmath51 and @xmath107 can be established : @xmath108 .",
    "we normalize @xmath107 as before , and then calculate @xmath51 and its associated uncertainties .",
    "this approach is less mathematically rigorous than rb , but it is sufficient to illustrate the insensitivity of the gate to addressing beam alignment and intensity noise ."

    "<S> locally minimizes spontaneous emission , but an eight - fold reduction could be obtained by doubling the wavelength , which would not dramatically compromise site addressing . </S>",
    "<S> the required powerful addressing beams would exert a significant force on line atoms , but deeper lattices and adiabatic addressing beam turn - on would make the associated heating negligible . in our current experiment we need to wait 70 @xmath22 after the addressing beams are turned on for our intensity lock to settle . </S>",
    "<S> technical improvement there could halve the time the light is on , ultimately leaving the spontaneous emission contribution to the error just below @xmath83 per gate . </S>",
    "<S> that limit is based on addressing with a differential light shift . </S>",
    "<S> it would disappear were the same basic scheme to be employed on a 3-level system , where only one of the qubit states is strongly ac stark shifted by the addressing light . in that case the phase shifting microwaves ( or light ) would simply be off - resonant from the qubit transition , and the error due to spontaneous emission would decrease proportional to the detuning . since the dominant target errors have the same sources as the non - target errors , improvements to the gate will correspondingly improve the crosstalk . </S>",
    "<S> adapting this method to more common 1d and 2d geometries is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> only a single addressing beam is needed , and the dummy stages would be executed with half - intensity addressing beams . the same insensitivity to addressing beam power and alignment would follow .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we report on a universal single qubit gate based on targeted phase shifts . </S>",
    "<S> the gate is robust to addressing light fluctuations , and can be applied to large arrays of qubits , including our demanding 3d lattice geometry . </S>",
