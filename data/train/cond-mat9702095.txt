    "in the last fifteen years two powerful approaches to calculate the electron transport properties of quasi 1d disordered wires have been developed : a method based on the nonlinear @xmath5 model by efetov and larkin @xcite and a fokker ",
    "planck approach by dorokhov @xcite , mello , pereyra and kumar @xcite .",
    "both methods are nonperturbative in the sense that they do not assume that the system size is small compared with the localization length @xmath3 .",
    "therefore the full range from the metallic to the localized regime can be described within these two frameworks .",
    "very recently it has been shown @xcite that both approaches are in fact equivalent , despite their considerable technical dissimilarity . apart from the important conceptual point of unifying our theoretical understanding of quasi 1d wires",
    "this proof of equivalence enables us to choose among the available techniques the more suitable one for a given problem . combining the results",
    "obtained within both approaches , our knowledge about quasi 1d transport is very advanced , some would say almost complete .",
    "we mention only a few important facts : both the conductance @xmath6 and its variance var@xmath7 have been calculated for arbitrary system length and for all three symmetry classes @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution function for the generalized eigenvalues of the transfer matrix is known exactly in the unitary case @xcite and the corresponding @xmath8point correlation functions are also under control @xcite . however , in spite of all this progress , there are still a few unsolved problems .",
    "one of the probably most important questions concerns the magnetic field correlation function @xmath9 .",
    "this quantity can not be formulated within the so  called `` minimal '' @xmath5 model , i.e. the supermatrix space necessary to describe this correlation function is larger than in previous nonperturbative calculations .",
    "the technical difficulties to treat larger @xmath5 models exactly have so far been insurmountable . in the fokker ",
    "planck approach , on the other hand , the question is how to incorporate the magnetic field in the theoretical formulation .",
    "this more conceptual problem also still awaits a solution .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the conductance _ length _",
    "correlation function @xmath10 for all @xmath1 and @xmath2 using the fokker  planck technique . in this case",
    "the situation is more favourable than for the magnetic field correlation function since the system length  unlike the magnetic field  is the fundamental parameter of the whole approach .",
    "therefore it is possible to perform an exact calculation of a quantity that can not be formulated within the framework of the minimal @xmath5 model .",
    "we briefly summarize our results : in the metallic limit @xmath11 the length correlation function is given by a squared lorentzian , while it decays exponentially as a function of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the localized regime @xmath12 .",
    "as @xmath1 increases from the metallic to the localized limit the correlation length in @xmath2 , which is proportional to @xmath1 for @xmath13 , saturates at a constant value equal to @xmath3 .",
    "this explicitly confirms the view that a strongly localized wire is composed of independently fluctuating segments of size @xmath3 . in a recent paper @xcite , s. feng , j.l .",
    "pichard and f. zeng have argued that , in the localized regime , the conductance fluctuations induced by the motion of a single impurity should be _ universal _ , @xmath14 ^ 2\\rangle \\approx 1 $ ] .",
    "here , @xmath6 and @xmath15 are the conductances before and after the impurity has moved , respectively .",
    "the main qualitative assumption necessary to arrive at this conclusion was precisely the decomposition into segments , which is rigorously derived in our paper .",
    "therefore , the universality of the conductance fluctuations in the localized regime can now be regarded as analytically established in quasi 1d wires .",
    "the arguments in @xcite , however , go beyond the quasi 1d case and suggest , supported by numerical simulations , that this universality extends also to 2d and 3d .",
    "the conductance length autocorrelation function is in principle accessible by experiments in mesoscopic nanostructures . for this",
    ", one has to fabricate a `` quasi one  dimensional '' quantum  wire with several contacts at discrete distances @xmath16 .",
    "using such a geometry , one can measure the conductance as a function of @xmath16 ( and of the magnetic field @xmath17 ) , where the disorder realization is _ identical _ for the common parts of the wire .",
    "one has to take into account , however , that in these multi - lead devices phase coherent scattering in the attached contact arms typically influences the experimental result . as usual , the statistical average necessary to calculate the mean conductance or the length autocorrelation function may be replaced by an average over a suitable range of the magnetic field .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . after collecting a few important known results concerning the fokker ",
    "planck approach in section ii , we develop the technical framework for the length correlation function of an arbitrary linear statistic in section iii . in section",
    "iv we derive a ( complex ) expression for the special case of the conductance length correlation function .",
    "sections v , vi and vii are devoted to the metallic , localized and crossover regimes , respectively . in section viii we give a short summary and make some concluding remarks . considerations of a purely technical nature have been deferred to appendices a to e.",
    "in the fokker  planck approach @xcite the transmission properties of a quasi 1d wire with @xmath18 conducting channels and length @xmath1 are characterized by @xmath18 generalized eigenvalues @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "they parametrize the radial part @xcite of the transfer matrix . with @xmath21 the transmission coefficients",
    ", the conductance @xmath6 is given by the landauer formula @xmath22 the multiplicative combination law for the transfer matrix yields the following fokker ",
    "planck equation @xcite for the probability distribution @xmath23 of the wire , @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the collection of eigenvalues @xmath26 , @xmath27 the length of the wire measured in units of ( twice ) the localization length @xmath3 , and @xmath28 the radial part of the laplacian on the transfer matrix space , @xmath29 we have @xmath30 , where @xmath31 corresponds to the orthogonal , unitary , and symplectic symmetry class , respectively , and @xmath32 is the elastic mean free path .",
    "the usual initial condition for ( [ eq:1 ] ) is given by @xmath33 , corresponding to ideal transmission @xmath34 for a wire of zero length .",

    "planck equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) has been solved exactly @xcite by means of a sutherland  transformation .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath8point correlation functions of the @xmath26 ( at a fixed value of the length @xmath1 ) have been calculated @xcite for arbitrary @xmath18 and @xmath1 . in the following",
    "we summarize some of the results in @xcite for further reference .",

    "here , @xmath46 denotes the generalized legendre function , which can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function @xmath47 as indicated above @xcite .",
    "the expansion of @xmath39 in terms of these eigenfunctions is given by @xcite @xmath48 using ( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) the limit in ( [ eq:4 ] ) can be evaluated @xcite .",
    "the resulting expression can be rewritten @xcite in the very useful form @xmath49 where ( @xmath50 ) @xmath51 the legendre polynomial @xmath52 in ( [ eq:13 ] ) is also an eigenfunction of @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding eignevalue is @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath52 do not contribute in the expansion ( [ eq:10 ] ) because they are not normalizable in the range of integration @xmath54 .",
    "the advantage of the representation ( [ eq:12 ] ) is due to the biorthogonality relation @xcite @xmath55 which was the key to calculating the @xmath8point correlation functions @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will also need the two properties @xmath56 these identities can be verified using ( [ eq:8 ] ) , ( [ eq:14 ] ) and the fact that @xmath57 ( see([eq:13 ] ) ) .",
    "we are finally interested in calculating the conductance length correlation function @xmath58 . to this end",
    "we need to know the joint probability density function of finding a certain fixed set of eigenvalues @xmath59 at @xmath60 and another fixed set @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",

    "in the localized regime , however , we have the asymptotic expression ( [ eq:83 ] ) and the situation changes . the exponential function , of course , does decay on a typical intrinsic scale . since @xmath221 and the curve in fig . 2 saturates at @xmath220 we see explicitly that the wire is divided into independent segments of size @xmath3 .",

    "the result also shows that any rearrangement in the wire ( of the disorder potential , say ) affects the full system since the correlation width is given by the system length .",
