    "the experimental demonstration of near - unity absorption in ultra - thin metal - dielectric - metal metamaterial structures @xcite opens many potential applications in sensing , detection , stealth technology , photovoltaics , and thermovoltaics @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanisms of the so - called metamaterial perfect absorber ( mpa ) have been addressed using effective medium theory @xcite , which approximates the whole metamaterial structure as a homogeneous slab with an effective bulk permittivity and permeability .",
    "it was found that the retrieved effective permeability can be described by a lorentzian function around the designed frequency , indicating the appearance of a magnetic resonance @xcite .",
    "this observation was further supported by full - wave simulations which showed the currents in the two metallic layers form a circulating current loop @xcite .",
    "more recently , an interference - based theory of the mpa has been proposed @xcite . by approximating thin planar metallic layers as homogeneous impedance - tuned interfaces between their boundary media @xcite ,",
    "the near - zero reflection and transmission can be obtained through the interference and superposition of the multiple reflections and transmissions @xcite . in agreement with the previous numerical observations , the currents in the two metallic layers predicted by this theory have almost equal amplitude and",
    "are nearly out - of - phase .    according to the grating theory @xcite , the electric field inside a mpa can be expanded as a superposition of bragg waves .",
    "on the other hand , since both theoretical approaches mentioned above disregard the periodic nature of the metamaterial structure , they thereby restrict to zero - order bragg waves . in this paper",
    "we go beyond this approximation by including all orders of bragg waves inside the mpa .",
    "we analytically show that the condition of mpa requires the existence of two currents within the metamaterial , which are nearly out of phase and have almost identical amplitude .",
    "furthermore , using a combination of analytical and numerical arguments , we show that non - zero - order bragg waves within the mpa consume electromagnetic energy .",
    "let us consider a metamaterial membrane , surrounded by vacuum , which is periodic in the @xmath0 plane . for simplicity , we assume its meta - atoms are arranged in a rectangle lattice with primitive lattice vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are the corresponding lattice constants .",
    "we further assume that the external illumination is a plane wave propagating along the @xmath5 direction with a wave vector @xmath6 . under this external excitation polarization currents , @xmath7\\mathbf{e}(\\mathbf{r},\\omega)$ ] , will appear inside the metamaterial . here",
    "@xmath8 is the permittivity of the metamaterial , a periodic function of @xmath9 . using the free space green s function",
    ", we can express the scattered field in terms of the current @xmath10 where the integration is performed over one unit cell , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are integers , @xmath13 is the free - space intrinsic impedance , @xmath14 is the excitation wavelength , and @xmath15 is the free - space wave number . the wave vector @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are the reciprocal wave vectors , and @xmath20 is the projection of the incident wave vector onto the @xmath0 plane . here",
    "the positive sign corresponds to forward scattering ( propagating along the positive @xmath5 direction ) , and the negative sign corresponds to backward scattering ( propagating along the negative @xmath5 direction ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath21\\left[\\mathbf{e}-\\mathbf{k}_{mn}(\\mathbf{k}_{mn}\\cdot\\mathbf{e})/k^{2}_{0}\\right]$ ] .",
    "it is important to emphasize that @xmath22 contains information of all bragg modes through the total electric field @xmath23 .    under certain circumstances @xmath24 is imaginary except for @xmath25 , so that only the zero order waves can survive in the far - field zone , e.g. at normal incidence and for @xmath14 bigger than the lattice constants .",
    "the forward wave is then given by @xmath26 the backward wave bears a similar expression except that @xmath6 is replaced with @xmath27 .",
    "this equation suggests that the tangential component of the incident wave vector is conserved .",
    "we now apply these equations to a metamaterial perfect absorber .",
    "we use a typical mpa proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( depicted schematically in fig .",
    "1 ) , which consists of three thin layers . the first layer is a perforated metallic membrane which is referred to as the cross layer , the second layer , called the spacer layer , is filled with a homogeneous dielectric medium with weak absorption , and the last layer is generally a metallic ground plane .",
    "furthermore , the meta - atoms of the cross layer are arranged periodically in a square lattice .",
    "the whole structure possesses both @xmath28 and @xmath29 mirror symmetries . under normal incidence @xmath30 , by symmetry",
    "@xmath31 is an even function of @xmath28 , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 are odd functions of @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , the lattice constant @xmath34 is smaller than the incident wavelength , so that only the zero - order waves survive in the far field . the forward and backward scattered fields in the far - field zone",
    "are hence given by @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the thickness of the mpa , and the integral function @xmath37 stands for the current density at a specific @xmath5 plane .",
    "note that although the forward and backward waves in the far field are determined by the zero - order bragg mode , the current @xmath38 however contains contributions from all orders of bragg waves within the structure since the quantity @xmath39 defined in eq.(2 ) equals to @xmath40 , the transverse component of the total current inside the metamaterial . as a direct result ,",
    "the reflected wave is @xmath41 , and the transmitted wave is @xmath42 .",
    "metallic bars .",
    "the thicknesses of the cross , spacer and ground layer are 0.1 , 0.09 and 0.2 , respectively . the total thickness @xmath36 equals 0.39 , and the lattice constant @xmath43 .",
    "all dimensions are in micrometers.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    a metamaterial with unity absorption neither reflects nor transmits the incident em wave to the far field , which is equivalent to requiring @xmath44 to simplify the notation , we dropped the @xmath45 dependence of @xmath46 here and in the following .",
    "the first equation imposes no reflection , and the second one leads to zero transmission . because the thickness @xmath36 is much smaller than @xmath14 , we can employ multipolar analysis by expanding @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",
    "the leading order gives the electric dipole and the first order of @xmath49 gives the combination of magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole .",
    "supposing these three multipoles dominate the above two integrations , we arrive at @xmath50 as well as @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath46 , respectively . eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) immediately suggest that there exists an electric dipole moment with a value of @xmath54 , and eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) imply that the mpa possesses a magnetic dipole as well as an electric quadrupole , and their sum equals @xmath55 ( see eq .",
    "( 9.31 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , as suggested by eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , these three multipoles are destructive along the reflected direction , which leads to zero reflectance .",
    "it is important to notice that the dielectric layer generally has a permittivity @xmath56 which is very different from the permittivity @xmath57 of the metallic layers .",
    "for instance , the ratio @xmath58 of the mpa studied below is about @xmath59 when @xmath60 m . since @xmath31 is continuous crossing the spacer - ground interface , the polarization current @xmath38 is strongly concentrated inside the metallic layers .",
    "we therefore can neglect the polarization current within the dielectric layer . denoting the total current of the cross and ground layer as @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) suggest @xmath63 in addition , eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) imply @xmath64 is much bigger than @xmath65 because @xmath66 .",
    "we therefore expect that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are nearly purely imaginary .",
    "in other words , the currents in the two metallic layers are nearly out of phase and have almost identical amplitude .",
    "this fact , here proved analytically , was reported in earlier numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that our proof does not require the computation of the current @xmath38 , which is usually carried out by full - wave simulations .    to support the statements above , we will now perform full - wave simulations of a mpa whose geometrical and optical parameters are almost identical to the ones used in ref .",
    "the geometrical parameters are specified in fig .",
    "the permittivity of the dielectric is described by a lorentz model @xcite , @xmath67 $ ] with @xmath68 , @xmath69 thz , @xmath70 thz and @xmath71 thz , which results in a permittivity @xmath72 , approximately constant in the relevant frequency regime , and almost identical to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite . it should be emphasized that this specific lorentz model for @xmath56 does not alter the underlying physics of mpa .",
    "the permittivity of the metal is described by a drude model , @xmath73 , with @xmath74 thz and @xmath75 thz . using a finite - difference time - domain method @xcite , where the size of spatial grid cell is fixed at 5 nm",
    ", we calculate the linear spectra at normal incidence and plot the results in fig .",
    "1 . around a wavelength of 5.93 @xmath76 m",
    ", the absorption is found to be nearly 100% .",
    "note that this wavelength is bigger than the lattice constant @xmath77 m , so that only zero - order bragg wave propagates to the far field .",
    "we further calculate the current function @xmath78 at this wavelength and plot the result in fig .",
    "2(a ) . to check our numerical results , we computed the integrations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , and verified that they are nearly identically satisfied .",
    "as discussed above , we find that the polarization current are strongly localized inside the two metallic layers , and a phase jump of @xmath79 appears at the spacer - ground interface .",
    "furthermore , we obtain @xmath80 and @xmath81 , in perfect agreement with the discussions above .    , and ( b ) the function @xmath82 , when @xmath83 m . the dielectric layer is highlighted.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "next we consider the dissipation of the electromagnetic energy within the mpa . according to poynting s theorem ,",
    "the energy absorption can be described by @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "consequently we define @xmath85 to measure the relative contribution from a specific @xmath5 plane . here",
    "@xmath86 describes the permittivity of the whole mpa structure . in general ,",
    "the electric field intensity inside a metamaterial is highly inhomogeneous , which is an indication of the appearance of high - order bragg waves , since the zero - order mode only gives a homogeneous field distribution .",
    "therefore one can conclude that high - order bragg waves definitely consume electromagnetic energy inside any nanostructure , in particular a mpa .",
    "we numerically calculate @xmath87 for the structure shown in fig . 1 , and plot the result in fig .",
    "2(b ) . under normal incidence , the two approximate theories proposed in ref.@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite consider only the zero - order mode ( @xmath25 ) , which is a plane wave propagating along the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the corresponding em field of the @xmath25 mode is parallel to the interface and must be continuous across the spacer - ground interface .",
    "if only this mode consumes electromagnetic energy , we expect that @xmath87 of the spacer layer is much smaller than that of the ground layer because @xmath88 , which however does not agree with our full - wave numerical result ( a similar calculation was reported in ref .",
    "this disagreement implies that higher - order bragg waves ( contained in full - wave simulation but omitted in effective medium theory ) contribute significantly to the dissipation of energy within the metamaterial .",
    "indeed , we find numerically that the ratio of @xmath89 inside the spacer layer ranges from 0.84 to nearly 1.0 , suggesting that non - zero - order waves have a dominant contribution to the total field in the spacer region .",
    "as discussed in the previous paragraph , one can alternatively infer the existence of high - order bragg waves from the highly localized electric field distribution inside the mpa , which is shown in fig .",
    "4 of ref.@xcite .",
    "to sum up , we studied the metamaterial perfect absorber in the framework of grating theory .",
    "we proved analytically that there always exists one circulating current loop ( akin to a magnetic dipole ) , together with an electric dipole as well as an electric quadrupole .",
    "we further showed that non - zero - order bragg waves may contribute significantly to the dissipation of the electromagnetic energy inside the perfect absorber .",
    "such an understanding of the process in the microscopic scale is important in exploring potential applications of metamaterial absorbers .",
