    "<S> a remarkably simple dependence of fragmentation cross - section on average binding energy has been established in experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence was empirically parametrised leading to a very useful formula for extrapolation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the canonical thermodynamic model , which has been used in the past for successful computations of many observables resulting from multifragmentation , reproduces the salient fetures of fragmentation cross - sections of very neutron rich nuclei very well . </S>",
    "<S> this helps towards a theoretical understanding of the observed data .    as part of a drive towards understanding the production mechanisms of rare isotopes , fragmentation cross - sections of many neutron rich isotopes </S>",
    "<S> have recently been measured from the @xmath0ca and @xmath1ni beams at 140 mev per nucleon on @xmath2be and @xmath3ta targets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> copper isotope cross - sections have been measured in projectile fragmentation of @xmath4kr at 64 mev per nucleon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable feature is the correlation between the measured fragment cross - section and the average binding energy ( fig.1)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this observation has prompted attempts of paramtrisation of cross - sections . </S>",
    "<S> one very successful parametrisation@xcite is @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the binding energy of the nucleus with mass number @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is 1 for even - even nuclei , 0 for odd - even nuclei and -1 for odd - odd nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing term smooths the straggling seen in the data when logarithms of cross - sections are plotted against @xmath10 for even - even and odd nuclei ( or odd - even and odd - odd nuclei ) . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical basis for the simple appearence of @xmath10 or the pairing term correction is not transparent . </S>",
    "<S> another equation which is highly successful is @xmath11\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for values of parameters and details see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we do calculations for the production cross - sections of silicon isotopes from projectile fragmentation of @xmath0ca and of copper isotopes from projectile fragmentation of @xmath4kr using the canonical thermodynamic model . </S>",
    "<S> some of these cross - sections are very small and they serve as very stringent tests of the model . </S>",
    "<S> the model has been extensively applied for production cross - sections of other particles which are more numerous @xcite and agreements are good . </S>",
    "<S> the basic physics of the model is the same as in many other models of intermediate energy heavy ion collisions : the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) @xcite or the microcanonical simulations of heavy - ion collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but smm or the microcanonical simulations are totally impractical for calculations of very small cross - sections as they rely on monte - carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the canonical model gives closed expressions and calculations can be made as accurate as desired . </S>",
    "<S> the grand canonical model is unsuitable for exploring these furthest limits of the phase - space and is expected to be very unreliable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will come back to this point later .    </S>",
    "<S> we will consider production of silicon isotopes from the statistical break up of @xmath12ca . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the avaerage number ( multiplicity ) of @xmath13si@xmath14 by @xmath15 . then the cross - section will be @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant not calculable from the thermodynamic model . </S>",
    "<S> it depends upon dynamics which is outside the scope of the model . </S>",
    "<S> similarly we will consider the production of cu isotopes @xmath18cu@xmath19 from a source which has 36 protons and 50 neutrons , i.e. , @xmath4kr . </S>",
    "<S> the source sizes adopted for the calculation are zero order guesses </S>",
    "<S> . it could be sometimes smaller or greater depending on the diffusion from the target </S>",
    "<S> .    we will write down the formulae used for the calculations but we will not derive them as they can be found elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fragmenting system ( @xmath0ca or @xmath4kr ) has @xmath20 protons and @xmath21 neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> the canonical partition function is given by @xmath22 here the sum is over all possible channels of break - up ( the number of such channels is enormous ) which satisfy @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is the partition function of one composite with proton number @xmath26 and neutron number @xmath27 respectively and @xmath28 is the number of this composite in the given channel . </S>",
    "<S> the one - body partition function @xmath25 is a product of two parts : one arising from the translational motion of the composite and another from the intrinsic partition function of the composite : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the mass of the composite and @xmath31 is the volume available for translational motion ; @xmath31 will be less than @xmath32 , the volume to which the system has expanded at break up . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the normal volume of nucleus with @xmath20 protons and @xmath21 neutrons . in this calculation </S>",
    "<S> we have used a fairly typical value @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> the probability of a given channel @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 the average number of composites with @xmath26 protons and @xmath27 neutrons is seen easily from the above equation to be @xmath38 the constraints @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be used to obtain different looking but equivalent recursion relations for partition functions . for example @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> these recursion relations allow one to calculate @xmath40    we list now the properties of the composites used in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the proton and the neutron are fundamental building blocks thus @xmath41 where 2 takes care of the spin degeneracy . for deuteron , </S>",
    "<S> triton , @xmath42he and @xmath43he we use @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the ground state energy of the composite and @xmath46 is the experimental spin degeneracy of the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> excited states for these very low mass nuclei are not included . for si and cu nuclei whose </S>",
    "<S> production cross - sections are sought in this work we use the experimental binding energies tabulated in @xcite but also include a term for contribution from excited states ( see the discussion following ) . for mass number @xmath47 and greater ( but charge @xmath48 ) </S>",
    "<S> we use the liquid - drop formula . for nuclei in isolation , this reads ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the derivation of this equation is given in several places @xcite so we will not repeat the arguments here . </S>",
    "<S> the expression includes the volume energy , the temperature dependent surface energy , the coulomb energy and the symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath51 represents contribution from excited states since the composites are at a non - zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this form was used in other applications of the model and we have kept this unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this term is also included in @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the fitting formula of eq.(2 ) a different expression for contribution from excited states is used .    </S>",
    "<S> we have to state which nuclei are included in computing @xmath40 . for @xmath53 , ( the proton and the neutron number ) we include a ridge along the line of stability . </S>",
    "<S> the liquid - drop formula above also gives neutron and proton drip lines and the results shown here include all nuclei within the boundaries .    </S>",
    "<S> the long range coulomb interaction between different composites can be included in an approximation called the wigner - seitz approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate this following the scheme set up in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it remains now to state the results . </S>",
    "<S> taken from @xcite shows the remarkable correlation between experimental values of cross - sections of silicon isotopes ( from @xmath0ca on @xmath2be reaction at 140 mev per nucleon ) and average binding energies . the experimental data on cross - sections ( shown as solid symbols in this paper ) span about seven orders of magnitude . in fig.2 we show results of our calculations(crosses ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are basically two parameters : an overall normalisation factor ( chosen in the figure to give the correct value of cross - section for @xmath54si ) and the temperature ( taken here to be 9.5 mev which is within the range of temperatures expected for this reaction ) . except at the tails of the distribution , </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is fair and the calculation does indeed give the very rapid decrease of the cross - section for large @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the straggling in values of the cross - sections between even - even and odd nuclei is also reflected in the calculation . in fig.3 </S>",
    "<S> we compare data and calculations for the case of production of copper isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> the data here span more than eight decades and the calculation , except for the tails , does very well . </S>",
    "<S> the straggling between cross - section values for odd - odd and odd copper isotopes is highlighted in fig.4 . in the same figure </S>",
    "<S> we show that both for data and calculation the straggling disappears if the cross - section is plotted against @xmath55 rather than against just @xmath56 ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find it gratifying that the model is able to reproduce such fine details .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we will make a connection with grand canonical fitting of the data @xcite . in our model </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath57 where the value of @xmath17 has to be taken from experiment . </S>",
    "<S> thus in a model of this type what we need is the ratio @xmath58 to be predicted correctly . from eq.(6 ) this is @xmath59 here @xmath60 are the charge and neutron number of the projectile which is fragmenting ( @xmath4kr or @xmath0ca ) and @xmath61 denotes cu or si isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> the right hand side of eq.(9 ) is very simple in the grand canonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the two canonical partition functions is replaced by a term independent of @xmath62 , i.e. , the right hand side is simply @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a constant for all @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> . that would be correct if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are large and also @xmath66 and @xmath67 whereas in small systems such as here , the ratio of the partition functions varies as @xmath62 changes . </S>",
    "<S> as we approach neutron drip line it drops fast with @xmath62 . in order to approximate the right hand side of eq.(9 ) by the simpler expression @xmath63 we need to choose @xmath64 judiciously and further alter the value of the temperature from the one used in the canonical model . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the temperature has to be significantly reduced .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , the canonical model reproduces the salient features of production cross - sections of very neutron rich nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical formulae for extrapolation @xcite are very useful and the canonical thermodynamic model can not hope to replace these but it aids to a theoretical understanding of the data . the same parameters that we have used here can be used to predict the production cross - sections of intrermediate mass fragments or the properties of the largest fragment after mutifragmentation @xcite . </S>"
