    "strongly frustrated quantum magnets in an external field are fascinating systems because the interplay between interactions and kinetics can lead to very rich phase diagrams . the magnetization can be described as a gas of bosonic particles whose density is controlled by the external magnetic field , and because frustration typically reduces the kinetic energy , mott insulating phases ( corresponding to magnetization plateaux)@xcite , superfluid or even supersolid phases have been predicted to occur@xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of these phases is an on - going challenge .",
    "a major player in the field is the layered copper oxide srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 , in which several magnetization plateaux have been observed@xcite .",
    "however , the definitive sequence of plateaux and the presence of supersolid phases remain open issues that call for further experimental and theoretical investigation .",
    "the magnetization of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 is expected to be described by the two - dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model known as the shastry - sutherland model@xcite in a magnetic field @xmath2 with @xmath3 , where the @xmath4i , j@xmath5 bonds build an array of orthogonal dimers while the @xmath6i , j@xmath7 bonds are best seen as inter - dimer couplings ( see fig .  [ fig : interactions_v+hoppings+axis ] ) . for @xmath8",
    "smaller than the phase transition point at @xmath9 @xcite , the ground state of the model is exactly given by the product of dimer singlets , and the magnetization process can be described in terms of hardcore bosons which represent polarized triplons @xmath10@xmath11 on the dimers interacting and moving on an effective square lattice@xcite .",
    "all theoretical approaches agree on the presence of magnetization plateaux at 1/3 and 1/2@xcite , in agreement with experiments@xcite .",
    "additionally , a plateau at 2/5 has been recently proposed in ref .",
    ". however , the structure below 1/3 is rather controversial . on the experimental side ,",
    "the original pulsed field data have only detected two anomalies interpreted as plateaux at 1/8 and 1/4@xcite , but the presence of additional phase transitions and of a broken translational symmetry above the 1/8 plateau has been established by recent torque and nmr measurements up to 31 t@xcite .",
    "the possibility of additional plateaux has been pointed out by sebastian et al@xcite , who have interpreted their high - field torque measurements as evidence for plateaux at @xmath12 with @xmath13 and at @xmath14 .    on the theoretical side , the situation is not settled either .",
    "the finite clusters available to exact diagonalizations prevent reliable predictions for high - commensurability plateaux , and the accuracy of the chern - simons mean - field approach initiated by misguich _ et al._@xcite and recently used by sebastian _ et al._@xcite to explain additional plateaux is hard to access .",
    "the essential difficulty lies in the fact that , since plateaux come from repulsive interactions between triplons , an accurate determination of the low - density , high - commensurability plateaux requires a precise knowledge of the long - range part of the interaction .",
    "a quantitative step in calculating this long - range part of the interaction has been achieved by high - order series expansions @xcite as well as by contractor renormalization @xcite . in ref .",
    "an effective low - energy hardcore boson model for the shastry - sutherland model in a magnetic field is derived .",
    "the classical solution of the effective model ( which is expected to work very well at low densities @xmath15 and not too large values of the perturbation @xmath16 ) gives a sequence of magnetization plateaux at 1/9 , 2/15 , and 1/6 .",
    "interestingly , the experimentally most prominent and most studied 1/8 plateau is not favored energetically @xcite .",
    "recently , a phenomenological theory based on interpreting boron and copper nmr data of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 in high magnetic fields reveals an even more complex magnetization process @xcite .",
    "evidences for a sequence of plateaux at densities 1/8 , 2/15 , and 1/6 is found .",
    "furthermore , the regime between 2/15 and 1/6 is interpreted as an infinite hierarchy of stripe structures .",
    "interestingly , the structure of the different plateaux is in disagreement with the proposed plateau structures in the classical limit @xcite .    .",
    "thick solid lines ( dot - dashed lines ) correspond to the magnetic exchange coupling @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the two - body interaction labelled by @xmath19 are defined as the density - density interaction between the thick dimer labeled as @xmath20 and the dimer labeled @xmath19 .",
    "( right ) the hopping amplitudes @xmath21 and @xmath22 are illustrated . ]    in this work , we are aiming at a microscopic theory which we want to compare with the phenomenological findings . to this end",
    ", we treat the quantum fluctuations of the pure shastry - sutherland model present at low densities and we extend the effective low - energy model derived by perturbative continuous unitary transformations ( pcuts)@xcite by the dominant effect of additional magnetic couplings .",
    "most importantly , we find that the inclusion of dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions results in a natural microscopic mechanism for the stability of a 1/8 plateau with a diamond unit cell . physically , such unfrustrated terms give rise to kinetic processes in the effective description and therefore they introduce quanum fluctuations in the classical plateau structures .",
    "additionally , it is shown that our theory predicts a stable 1/6 plateau whose structure is only consistent with the phenomenological theory if the coupling ratio @xmath8 is rather large .",
    "this is not a consequence of the induced quantum fluctuations .",
    "it results from the fact that the two - body density - density interactions do not respect anymore the perturbative hierarchy close to the phase transition point and therefore novel structures are stabilized .",
    "finally , our theory predicts a series of stripe structures between 1/8 and 1/6 .",
    "altogether , our theory shares many similarities with the recent findings for srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 in a magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , several discrepancies between the microscopic and the phenomenological theory still remain .",
    "this is either due to the limited access to the most complicated non - perturbative regime of the studied microscopic model or due to the fact that the physics of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 in a magnetic field depends on further subtle details of the material .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : classicalplateaux ] , we explain the origin of the classical plateaux in the effective model and we introduce the relevant plateau structures . in sect .

    "the pcut transforms the shastry - sutherland model into an effective model conserving the number of triplons@xcite .",
    "the relevant processes for the physics in a finite magnetic field have maximum total spin and total @xmath23 .",
    "this is true as long as bound states are not essential at low energies @xcite which we assume in the following .",
    "the effective hamiltonian obtained by the pcut takes then the form of an interacting hardcore boson model where the amplitudes of the hardcore boson model are given as a high - order series expansion in @xmath8 .",
    "typically , any kind of kinetic and interaction processes are present in such an effective model .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath24 is by no means simpler than the original one in general , but it is in the limit of small density . in ref .",
    "all terms with up to three creation and annihilation operators and all four - body interactions that first appear up to order @xmath25 have been kept .",
    "but in the small density limit @xmath15 , the magnetization is not affected by the three - particle and four - particle interactions @xcite . furthermore , in that limit the kinetic terms are very small , and they can be considered as a perturbation of the interaction part .",
    "it is thus appropriate to use a hartree approximation in which the variational ground state is a product of local boson wave - functions since this approximation becomes exact in the limit of vanishing kinetic energy .",
    "this hartree approximation is most simply implemented by mapping the effective model onto a spin 1/2 model using the matsubara - matsuda representation@xcite of hardcore bosons . in the spin language",
    "it then translates into the classical approximation ( ca ) where the spins are treated as classical vectors of length 1/2 .",
    "it has been found in ref .   that only magnetization plateaux are realized in the classical limit ( except a tiny superfluid in the dilute limit ) although superfluid or supersolid phases can be described within the ca .",
    "the magnetization plateaux correspond to wigner crystals where triplons are frozen in a periodic fashion in the ground state breaking the discrete translational symmetry of the problem .",
    "the classical energy of all plateaux at low densities @xmath15 can be quantitatively captured by the following effective hamiltonian @xmath26 where the sum over @xmath20 runs over all the sites of the effective square lattice formed by the dimers .",
    "the first term represents the chemical potential @xmath27 of hard - core bosons where @xmath28 corresponds to the external magnetic field @xmath29 and where @xmath30 originates from the shastry - sutherland model .",

    "various extrapolations still give consistent results for the two - body interactions .",
    "interestingly , we find that the perturbative hierarchy becomes invalid for @xmath40 , i.e.  one observes @xmath41 and @xmath42 although these interactions do not originate from the same perturbative order . in the following",

    "the details of the calculation will be discussed below .",
    "it is remarkable that there are only two transitions with two multi - intersectional points ( see fig .",

    "the two plateaux @xmath52-diamond and @xmath52-tilted are almost degenerate and slightly above the @xmath52-ca plateau .",
    "the existence of the 1/8 plateau in the frustrated quantum magnet srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 can therefore not be explained solely by the effective interactions @xcite .",
    "the origin must be a consequence of quantum fluctuations which either originate from the shastry - sutherland model itself or from additional magnetic terms like the dm - interaction .",
    "below , we will indeed show that the dm - interaction plays a central role for the appearance of the 1/8 plateau with a diamond unit cell .",
    "although the sequence of plateaux is unchanged when @xmath8 is increased , the structure of the classical @xmath50 plateau becomes different for @xmath53 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the two - body interaction @xmath54 strongly increases for large @xmath8 compared to the competing terms @xmath35 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : interactions_v+hoppings+axis ] and [ fig : interactions_v_plot ] ) .",
    "it therefore becomes attractive to realize structures containing the latter interactions and to avoid @xmath54 .",

    "[ fig : classr2_j50 ] and fig .",

    "[ fig : classr2_j68 ] .",
    "all the three plateaux have exactly the same classical energy .",

    "let us remark that the accuracy of the value @xmath56 , where the 1/6 structure does change in the classical limit , of course depends on the accuracy of the two - body interactions @xmath19 which might lead to a little shift of this value .    .",

    "in the following we discuss the quantum fluctuations which are relevant for the magnetization plateaux at low densities .",
    "we study first the kinetic terms of the pure shastry - sutherland model .",
    "afterwards we discuss the effect of additional magnetic couplings like dm interactions or heisenberg exchanges to more distant neighbors .",
    "it is known that there exists only one very weak standard hopping process @xmath22 in the shastry - sutherland model due to the strong frustration @xcite .",
    "this kinetic process represents a hopping over the diagonal ( see fig .  [",

    "it is important to realize that all of these interactions are typically unfrustrated and , as a consequence , will pump kinetic energy into the system . here",

    "this is expected to be a reasonable approximation since all the additional couplings are small perturbations of the order @xmath65 .",
    "let us stress that these perturbations can nevertheless be important at low densities because perturbatively the two - body interactions stabilizing the low - density plateaux appear in a rather high order in @xmath8 as discussed in detail above .     in @xmath66-direction .",

    "we start by discussing the effects of dm interactions @xmath69 which turn out to be the most relevant correction for srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 .",
    "one has to distinguish between intra- and inter - dimer dm interactions .    taking the dm interaction as a perturbation of the bare shastry - sutherland model",
    ", it can be easily checked that the intra - dimer dm interactions leads to a mixing of singlet and triplet states on the single dimers .",
    "the effective low - energy model is therefore only affected in second order perturbation theory for this perturbation .",
    "this is different for the inter - dimer interaction between two dimers .",

    "another aspect for a microscopic description of the material srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 are additional heisenberg exchanges to more distant dimers .",
    "the couplings to next nearest - neighbor dimers are denoted by @xmath80 and by @xmath81 .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustrations_couplings ] . one can easily see that both couplings contribute in first order to the already discussed diagonal hopping element @xmath22 present in the pure shastry - sutherland model @xmath82 recently , ab - initio calculations estimated @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 @xcite . the latter ratio for @xmath8 is likely too small .",

    "indicate a melting of the wigner crystals which is expected once the kinetic terms are large enough to win over the potential terms . in our mean - field treatment focusing on crystalline phases ,",

    "we find that the nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath21 should be @xmath198 .",

    ", we should focus on a ratio @xmath53 and we should consider kinetic couplings @xmath198 and @xmath182 .",
    "consequently , we plot the density as a function of @xmath175 for @xmath45 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 in fig .  [",
    "fig : magnet_j68_2_15_3_32 ] . additionally , we present our results for the density pattern ( fig .  [",

    "the latter is calculated according to eqs .",
    "[ fig : obs ] ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : magnetscheme ] ) .",
    "most prominently , a @xmath52 plateau with diamond unit cell as well as the @xmath50-new plateau is realized in the phase diagram .",
    "the just discussed @xmath49 striped plateau is also realized but its width is very tiny .",
    "furthermore , there are additionally three interesting density regimes which one should discuss : i ) densities below @xmath48 , ii ) densities @xmath201 , and iii ) densities @xmath202 .",
    "we start the discussion with the regimes i ) and iii ) which are denoted by @xmath152 and @xmath155 in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnet_j68_2_15_3_32 ] .",
    "we believe that our mean - field theory gives unphysical results for both density regions , but due to different physical reasons . in the low - density region @xmath152 , we find a negative mean - field energy @xmath163 at @xmath154 for all plateau structures below @xmath48 .",
    "as explained above , it is very likely that these magnetization plateaux melt due to the introduced quantum fluctuations if one allows also superfluid mean - field solutions ( or treat the problem beyond mean - field theory ) .",
    "in contrast , for the regime @xmath155 between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , all plateau structures are such that at least one particle is completely delocalized between at least two different dimers .",
    "two examples of such structures for densities 1/7 and 3/20 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnet2 ] .",
    "these are therefore clearly structures which are extremely far away from perturbed classical plateau structures where our mean - field theory is expected to work well . in total , we do not trust our mean - field results in the regions @xmath152 and @xmath155 .",
    "+    the second regime ii ) which includes the above discussed striped @xmath49 structure is different .",
    "in fact , the same microscopic mechanism giving rise to the @xmath49 plateau , applies to an ( in principle ) infinite number of striped plateaux above @xmath52 .",
    "the specific stripe structures together with their magnetizations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : allstripemech ] .",
    "most importantly , our findings agree well with the experimental data of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 @xcite : one finds that the translational symmetry stays broken above the @xmath52 plateau .",
    "let us finally discuss to what extent so - called correlated hopping terms can alter the above findings .",
    "we have computed all correlated hopping terms starting at most in order 6 in @xmath8 up to order 14 in @xmath8 .",
    "as already mentionned , such couplings allow a hopping of a particle when another particle is present and remains static .",
    "the quantum fluctuations induced by correlated hopping depends therefore on the density . the higher the density , the more important is the effect of correlated hopping for the formation of plateau structures .",
    "let us remark that correlated hopping has been also identified as a possible driving force for the realization of so - called pair superfluids @xcite .",
    "if realized , such phases are expected to be present at very low densities in the density range which we have classified as @xmath152 .",
    "the description of such phases goes well beyond our mean - field considerations .",
    "formally , a correlated hopping process is written as @xmath203 , i.e.  a particle hops from dimer @xmath20 to dimer @xmath204 with an amplitude @xmath205 if another particle is present on dimer @xmath206 .",
    "the importance of such a correlated hopping term for a specific wigner crystal depends on one hand on the strength @xmath205 and on the other hand on the potential barrier on dimer @xmath204 on which the particle hops .",
    "a correlated hopping process induces therefore large quantum fluctuations whenever its amplitude is large and the involved repulsive interactions in intermediate states are small .",
    "let us discuss the most important correlated hopping terms for the relevant structures at densities @xmath48 , @xmath52 , and @xmath50 as discussed above . for @xmath94 ,",
    "there is no correlated hopping process starting up to order 6 which induce quantum fluctuations on the classical 1/9-plateau .",
    "one can therefore conclude that correlated hopping has no real impact on the mean - field energy of this plateau .    for the relevant structures at density @xmath160 , there",
    "exist correlated hopping terms starting in order six perturbation theory having an amplitude of the order @xmath207 in the regime @xmath87 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : correlated_hopping ] ) . in our mean - field treatment , these terms renormalize slightly the values for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , the induced quantum fluctuations are very similar for the structures @xmath52-diamond , @xmath52-tilted , and @xmath52-ca .",
    "altogether , all our findings for density @xmath52 are expected to be unchanged when correlated hopping terms are included .",
    "the situation is different for the structures at density @xmath63 .",
    "here correlated hopping processes exist which start already in order four perturbation theory .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes are of the order @xmath65 for @xmath87 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : correlated_hopping ] ) .",
    "the most relevant hopping processes are those which do not contain any of the large repulsive interactions @xmath34 or @xmath88 in intermediate states because then in full analogy to the discussion above fluctuations from the classical position are not strongly suppressed .",
    "interestingly , the induced quantum fluctuations due to these correlated hopping terms are again almost identical for the structures @xmath50-stripe , @xmath50-square , and @xmath50-new .",
    "we therefore expect that our results for density @xmath50 also hold when correlated hopping terms are taken into account .",
    "the most subtle density regime is the one between @xmath52 and @xmath50 where our mean - field calculation predicts an infinite sequence of stripe structures .",
    "again , there exist correlated hopping terms starting in order four perturbation theory which are of similar magnitude as the kinetic processes @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , one expects that correlated hopping may have some impact on this hierarchy of plateau structures",
    ". this might be especially true for the density regime just below @xmath50 where our mean - field calculation stabilizes unphysical states classified as @xmath155 in the phase diagram",
    ". it would be therefore highly interesting to study this part of the phase diagram in more detail , because one might expect supersolid phases due to the increasingly important correlated hopping terms @xcite .",
    "the main motivation of this work is the discrepancy between experiment and theory on the understanding of the magnetization curve of the frustrated quantum magnet srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 .",
    "the most prominent magnetization plateau at @xmath208 is currently not understood microscopically .",
    "instead a sequence of plateaux at @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 is found at low magnetization @xcite .",
    "interestingly , additional low - density plateaux at @xmath210 and @xmath211 have been recently observed experimentally @xcite but their structures disagree with theory .",
    "microscopically , it is believed that the material srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 is well described by the shastry - sutherland model . in ref .",
    ", an appropriate effective low - energy theory for the shastry - sutherland model in an external magnetic field is derived which is then solved in the classical limit .",
    "the classical approach is believed to work well because quantum fluctuations are strongly suppressed due to the strong frustration in the shastry - sutherland model .",
    "the latter is certainly true as long as one is not too close to the phase transition point @xmath212 or as long as additional magnetic couplings are negligible .",
    "additionally , one assumes that bound states of triplons are not essential for the formation of plateaux at low densities @xcite .",
    "here we have studied the effect of quantum fluctuations on the sequence of magnetization plateaux at low densities @xmath15 which originate either from additional magnetic couplings like the dm - interaction or from the one - particle hopping already contained in the shastry - sutherland model . both couplings",
    "are expected to be of the order @xmath65 at strong coupling @xmath87 which is the relevant parameter regime for srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 .",
    "physically , the plateaux are formed by freezing hardcore bosons in a regular fashion in order to avoid the strong repulsive interactions dominating the effective low - energy description .",
    "quantum fluctuations correspond then to kinetic processes of the hardcore bosons in the effective model . here",
    "we have treated the kinetic terms on a mean - field level by reducing the complex many - body problem to an effective one - body problem which is solved self - consistently .",
    "we have concentrated on crystalline solutions of the mean - field equations .",
    "it is the central result of this article that quantum fluctuations are essential to understand the low - density phase diagram of the compound srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we find several indications that the ratio @xmath8 is very large @xmath213 placing the frustrated quantum magnet srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 in the most complex parameter regime .",
    "both aspects together result in a low - density phase diagram which is different to the classical sequence @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 but much closer to the experimental results and their phenomenlogical interpretation @xcite : a ) we find that quantum fluctuations stabilize in a natural way a 1/8 plateau with a diamond unit cell consistent with experiments .",
    "the quantum fluctuations induced by the dm interactions play a central role .",
    "b ) the structure of the @xmath50 plateau changes already on the classical level for @xmath189 .",
    "microscopically , the repulsive interaction @xmath36 becomes comparable to @xmath35 in this parameter regime and , as a consequence , it becomes favorable to realize structures avoiding @xmath36 .",
    "this is likely the reason why the classical structures found in ref .   for @xmath44 are different to the ones observed experimentally .",
    "all classical structures for @xmath44 depend strongly on @xmath36 . for @xmath189 ,",
    "one finds that the three classical structures @xmath50-stripe , @xmath50-square , and @xmath50-new have exactly the same classical energy .",
    "interestingly , the structure @xmath50-stripe is proposed phenomenologically @xcite . in our mean - field theory ,",
    "quantum fluctuations favor the structure @xmath50-new but we would like to stress that energy differences are very small .",
    "c ) in the regime between @xmath52 and @xmath50 our mean - field theory predicts a sequence of stripe structures all containing substructures of densities @xmath52 and @xmath50 .",
    "this sequence includes a @xmath49 plateau .",
    "qualitatively , this is again consistent with the phenomenological interpretation of the nmr data @xcite .",
    "but in the mean - field treatment it is always the @xmath52 plateau with a diamond unit cell which is realized inside the stripes because it benefits most from the induced quantum fluctuations .",
    "d ) the mean - field solution is still consistent with a plateau at density @xmath48 which is in disagreement with the nmr data on srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 but in accordance with high - field torque measurements by sebastian et al@xcite .",
    "but we stress that it is well possible that the @xmath48 plateau melts completely when superfluid solutions are considered , when effects beyond the mean - field level are taken into account , or when additional magnetic couplings are present .",
    "indeed , as we have shown above , already slightly larger values for the kinetic terms lead to a melting of the @xmath48 plateau .",
    "( top ) and density @xmath50 ( down ) . ]    clearly , there are limitations of our microscopic approach .",
    "one has to distinguish the following three levels : i ) limitations of the mean - field treatment , ii ) limitations of the effective low - energy description , and iii ) limitations of the studied microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "\\i ) we have focused on crystalline solutions of the mean - field equations because the magnetization curve of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 is dominated by magnetization plateaux corresponding to gapped bosonic mott insulators .",
    "definitely , this approach is hard to justify in the dilute limit where one expects superfluid solutions to be present in the phase diagram . in our theory , we find a sequence of low - density plateau structures with a negative energy for @xmath154 .",
    "this part of the phase diagram denoted by @xmath152 in this work corresponds likely to a superfluid phase .",
    "additionally , the mean - field treatment becomes problematic when the physics can not be reduced to an effective one - body problem .",
    "we found solutions in the density regime between @xmath52 and @xmath50 denoted by @xmath155 where particles in the regions are completely delocalized between different dimers .",
    "this is clearly an artefact of the mean - field calculation and we do not trust the mean - field solution in this density regime .",
    "one possibility to go beyond might be to map the effective low - energy model in terms of hardcore bosons to a quantum spin model which is then solved by spin - wave theory on various large unit cells .",
    "\\ii ) the effective low - energy theory is limited by the extrapolations used for the various couplings and by the choice of operators included in the effective low - energy description .",
    "qualitatively , we expect that all revelant tendencies are correctly described by the extrapolations up to the relevant regime @xmath213 .",
    "it is nevertheless well possible that errors in the extrapolations lead to little changes , e.g.  the value @xmath189 where the structure of the @xmath50 plateau changes already on the classical level might shift slightly .",
    "one option to go beyond is to determine the effective couplings like the repulsive interactions non - perturbatively using continuous unitary transformation @xcite or contractor renormalization @xcite .",
    "indeed , this would be of great help in order to describe the physics quantitatively in the relevant coupling regime of large @xmath8 .",
    "the choice of operators to be treated in the effective low - energy models depends on the density .",
    "here we have included two - body interactions and one - particle hopping . at low densities",
    "this is certainly a very good approximation . as discussed above",
    ", corrections like correlated hopping are negligible for @xmath62 .",
    "we therefore expect that all our findings for the most relevant @xmath52 plateau are quantitatively correct .",
    "in contrast , the same is less obvious for the density regime @xmath214 . here",
    "certain correlated hopping processes could be important .",
    "a correct treatment of the correlated hopping processes is most likely only possible if one goes beyond a mean - field description . at larger densities like @xmath64 , correlated hopping",
    "is expected to be relevant @xcite .",
    "\\iii ) our results demonstrate clearly that residual interactions of the order @xmath65 beyond the pure shastry - sutherland model are important for the magnetization of the frustrated quantum magnet srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 . here",
    "we have included the effects of dm interactions and of additional heisenberg couplings to next - nearest neighbors by including the order - one contribution to the effective low - energy model .",
    "higher orders in such couplings are expected to be unimportant . but let us stress that we have not considered effects linear in the additional couplings times a factor @xmath215 with @xmath216 .",
    "most importantly , it would be interesting to study the feedback effect of the additional couplings on the two - body repulsive interactions @xcite . finally , let us mention that the role of inter - plane exchange couplings for the formation of plateau structures is currently not understood .    altogether",
    ", we have presented an important step towards a microscopic description of the frustrated quantum magnet srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 .",

    "<S> physically , such couplings result in kinetic terms in an effective hardcore boson description leading to a renormalization of the energy of the different plateaux structures which we treat in this work on the mean - field level . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the resulting plateaux are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our results indicate a series of stripe structures above 1/8 and a stable magnetization plateau at 1/6 . </S>",
    "<S> most qualitative aspects of our microscopic theory agree well with a recently formulated phenomenological theory for the experimental data of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 . interestingly </S>",
    "<S> , our calculations point to a rather large ratio of the magnetic couplings in the shastry - sutherland model such that non - perturbative effects become essential for the understanding of the frustrated quantum magnet srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 . </S>"
