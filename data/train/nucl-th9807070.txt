    "<S> 3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> as already discussed , a source of uncertainty in our calculations is given by the choice of the nucleon - nucleon cross sections . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we present calculations with in - medium reduced cross sections ( solid lines ) and with free - space cross sections ( dashed lines ) in comparison with experimental widths for nuclei @xmath2pb ( a ) and @xmath3sn ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is a quite good reproduction of the experimental trend independently on the choice of cross sections .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the isovector response of heated spin - isospin symmetric nuclear matter on the basis of the linearized landau - vlasov equation with a collision integral including memory effects in the relaxation time approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the thermal landau damping into the total damping rate of isovector vibrations is found to be very small . </S>",
    "<S> thus the relaxation of the volume isovector mode is caused mainly by nucleon - nucleon collisions . </S>",
    "<S> increasing temperature shifts the centroid energy of the isovector strength function to smaller values . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated width is proportional to @xmath90 in the temperature region @xmath1 mev studied in this letter , that corresponds to the collisional damping of the isovector zero sound mode . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a @xmath0 behaviour of the @xmath91 in the region where the collective mode can propagate .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that some general gdr properties at high excitation energy can be obtained directly from fermi liquid theory . however </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this work is not to get a perfect agreement with data for finite nuclei particularly at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we are well aware that other contributions to the damping are missing in the present approach : ( i ) the fragmentation width , observed in rpa calculations , which can be interpreted as a landau damping mechanism in finite fermi systems present also at zero temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) thermal shape fluctuations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) fluctuations due to nucleon - nucleon correlations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a recent statistical model analysis of @xmath92-spectra produced by inelastic @xmath93-scattering on @xmath3sn @xcite resulted in conclusion that neither the thermal fluctuation model of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite nor the collisional damping model of this work could reproduce data in details . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the combination of the two models would give a much better agreement .    </S>",
    "<S> extension to isospin asymmetric nuclear systems , more suitable for the @xmath94 case , can be performed following the approach of ref.s @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we do not expect to have substantial variations in the temperature behaviour of the isovector and isoscalar modes unless very high charge asymmetries are reached @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however in charge asymmetric nuclei , new soft mode , different from isovector and isoscalar ones , appears @xcite due to collisional coupling of proton and neutron vibrations , that requires further investigations .    </S>",
    "<S> finally a comment on the validity of the formalism applied here to the study of hot @xmath95 in nuclei to a broader context of physical problems . </S>",
    "<S> indeed it can be easily generalized to the description of relative vibrations of any two - component fermi liquid with a mutual attraction , for instance of a coulomb plasma consisting of opposite charged fermions . </S>",
    "<S> another application could be to the oscillations of the electronic cloud in metallic clusters , where momentum nonconserving @xmath20 term in collision integral appears due to scattering of electrons on impurities @xcite . </S>"
