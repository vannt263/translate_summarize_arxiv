    "in spite of remarkable progress , and although it is well established that the ultimate energy source is the coronal magnetic field , the question of how the magnetic energy is transformed to heat the coronal plasma is still to be solved ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . among the several aspects debated in the literature one important issue",
    "is whether the heating is released gradually and continuously or in the form of discrete , rapid and intense pulses .",
    "several physical and technical reasons inhibit a direct answer , e.g. , the efficient thermal conduction along the magnetic field lines , the low emission from the heating site , and limited spatial and temporal resolution @xcite .",
    "the question is made even more difficult by the increasing evidence for an extremely fine - structured confined corona : the magnetic flux tubes that confine the bright coronal plasma are collections of a multitude of thin strands , of expected cross - section below the resolution of past and current coronal telescopes @xcite . finding direct signatures with current instruments is therefore not feasible for these inherently elusive mechanisms that occur on very small spatial scales .",
    "indirect diagnostics are thus the only viable way at present .",
    "a feature that may strongly discriminate between gradual and impulsive heating release is the presence or absence of plasma at very high temperature .",
    "if we consider an active region , in order to keep the coronal loops at the typical temperature of 2 - 3 mk , we expect that occasional heat pulses should be so strong as to temporarily heat the plasma temperature to several mk , even above 10 .",
    "since we expect these heating episodes to be spread over all coronal structures , we might also search for a consequent minor but steady very hot plasma ( @xmath2  mk ) component .",
    "this might appear either as a hot tail or as a secondary peak to the hot side of the plasma emission measure distribution .",
    "increasing evidence for this minor hot component has been collected in recent times , both with filter ratios or differential emission measure ( dem ) reconstruction from imaging broad - band instruments ( xrt , e.g. , @xcite ) and with spectroscopic line analysis ( single line or dem reconstruction , e.g. , @xcite ) , but it is still not conclusive for various reasons .",
    "spectroscopy would be ideal to reveal hot plasma but the moderate spatial and temporal coverage inhibits systematic campaigns and makes any detection or non - detection partial and limited ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "also , dem reconstructions typically suffer from severe limitations due to several factors such as the small number of line fluxes available in a narrow range of temperature , uncertainties in the element abundances , and , also in atomic data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this makes dem reconstruction reliable on a large temperature scale at most , but much less on the details ( e.g. , @xcite ; testa et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "it becomes then appealing and reasonable to search for methods to discover hot plasma components with simple diagnostics and without addressing dem reconstruction methods .",
    "recently @xcite have used a different approach to infer the widespread presence of 6 - 8  mk plasma in the core of an active region .",
    "a model of multi - stranded pulse - heated coronal loop had predicted that if any very hot component were present , it would be characterized by spatial distribution of its emission significantly more sparse compared to the 2 - 3  mk emission @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; @xcite ) on board the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo ) is based on normal - incidence optics and is equipped with 6 narrow - band filters in the euv band ( 94 - 335 ) that contain a few strong spectral lines that sample the solar corona in a wide temperature range , approximately between 0.5 and 10  mk .",
    "the instrument continuously monitors the full - disk corona with high cadence ( @xmath3s ) and a pixel size of @xmath4  arcsec .",
    "one of the filter , the 94  channel , includes a highly ionized fe line , , that is sensitive to plasma at temperature in the range 6 - 8  mk .",
    "@xcite show that the bright 94  emission in an active region core matches very well the filamented aspect predicted in the modeling paper .",
    "however , the 94  passband nominally includes other spectral lines that make it sensitive also to plasma emitting in a range around 1  mk @xcite .",
    "the radically different morphology of the image obtained in the 171  channel , containing a very strong   line sensitive to plasma at @xmath5  mk , made the authors conclude that most of the plasma detected in the 94  channel was in the hot branch .",
    "however , the lack of spectral resolution in the _ aia _ observations leaves room to unknown line contributions that make the result not unequivocal .",
    "therefore , conclusive evidence whether the 94  bright emission in the core of active regions can be ascribed to hot plasma is expected to come from comparison with spectroscopic data .",
    "the extreme - ultraviolet imaging spectrometer ( _ eis _ ) on board _ hinode _",
    "@xcite is sensitive in the euv band ( in the 171 - 212  and 245 - 291   spectral ranges ) and is able to provide images ( spectroheliograms ) in spectral lines thanks to rastering programs that take few minutes to hours , depending on the target and field of view ( fov ) . in spite of the moderate spatial and temporal resolution ,",
    "this instrument is appropriate for our task , since it has imaging capabilities , and its spectral range includes a  line that is emitted by plasma at 6 - 8  mk @xcite .",
    "the scope of this work is to validate the detection of very hot plasma in active regions through the direct comparison of the morphology simultaneously observed with _",
    "hinode / eis _ in the  line and with _ sdo / aia _ in the 94  channel .",
    "finding that well - defined bright structures have the same appearance in both observations would be a very strong evidence that the bright 94  emission in the ar cores really is due to plasma at 6 - 8  mk .",
    "the task that we have tackled in this work is not so easy for various reasons : among the active regions that in the 94  _ aia _ channel show the presence of hot plasma , we have to find examples observed at the same time with _ eis _ in the band including the  line and including the hot plasma region in its fov .",
    "furthermore , the emission in the  line is not trivial to extract , because of blending with other lines , and consequently the deblended emission can be trusted only in regions where it is strong @xcite .",
    "finally , also the coalignment of the obtained _ eis _  image with the _ aia _ images is non - trivial .    in section  [",
    "s : method ] we describe the data selection , co - alignment procedure , analysis methods , and results .",
    "we discuss our findings and draw our conclusions in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "we searched for active region observations with simultaneous _",
    "sdo / aia _ imaging , and _ hinode / eis _ spectral data , including the _ eis _ short wavelength range ( 171 - 212 ) , where the hot  emission line lies ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we selected two active regions , ar 11281 and ar 11289 , observed close to disk center in september 2011 .",
    "the selected _ eis _ rasters are characterized by field of view of 120@xmath7160 , slit width of 2 , and exposure time of 60  s at each step ( study acronym atlas_60 ) .",
    "the images are built up by stepping the 2  slit from solar west to east over a @xmath5  hr period .",
    "the study takes full spectra on both the  detectors from 171 - 212  and 245 - 291 .",
    "the _ eis _",
    "observations of ar 11281 have a start time of 2011 september 02 at 23:32ut , whereas the observations of ar 11289 started on 2011 september 13 at 10:37ut .",
    "the  data are processed with the eis_prep routine available in solarsoft to remove the ccd dark current , cosmic - ray strikes on the ccd , and take into account hot , warm , and dusty pixels .",
    "in addition , the radiometric calibration is applied to convert the data from photon events to physical units .",
    "the  routine eis_ccd_offset is also used to correct for the ccd offset .",
    "we selected simultaneous _",
    "data in the 171 , 335 , 94 , and 193  passbands , and processed the level 1 data with the aia_prep routine , which performs image registration ( co - alignment , and adjustments for the different plate scales and roll angle ) and is also available as a part of solarsoft .    in figure",
    "[ fig : aia_eis ] ( left panels ) we show the 3 color full disk _ aia _ images combining the 171 , 335 , and 94  intensities ( green , blue , and red respectively ) , at the start time of the _ eis _ observations .",
    "the field of view of the eis observations ( 120  arcsec @xmath7 160  arcsec ) is marked on the full disk _ aia _ images .",
    "we coaligned the datasets from the two instruments by applying a standard cross - correlation routine ( tr_get_disp.pro which is part of the idl solarsoftware package ) , to the _ eis _ images of the  193   emission obtained from fitting the _ eis _ spectra , and the 193   _ aia _ synthetic rasters ( composite image , hereafter ) built as follows : each vertical stripe is extracted from the aia image closest in time to the time when the _ eis _ slit was at that location .",
    "after co - aligning the time series _ aia _ images in each channel ( for the 1 hour period corresponding to the _ eis _ observations ) , and between channels , and to the _ eis _ data , we created _ aia _ composite images in each channel . in figure",
    "[ fig : aia_eis ] ( middle panels ) we show the 3 color images , obtained by combining the 171 , 335 , and 94 , composite images in the _ eis _ fov . for each channel",
    "the intensity range chosen for the color scale covers a factor 40 , where the maximum is roughly half of the intensity maximum in the channel ; the color scale is the same for the two datasets .",
    "most features in the 3 color images appear dominated by a single color , the moss being a clear exception , as expected .",
    "for instance , the fan loops at the boundary of the ar are predominantly green ( i.e. , with dominant emission in the 171  band ) , whereas blue ( i.e. , 335 ) largely characterizes the emission of active region plasma .",
    "a few ar features are however dominantly pink - red , indicating significant emission in the 94   and 335  bands , with negligible contribution from the 171  emission .",
    "the contribution of different spectral features to the _ aia _ 94  channel , as predicted using the chianti database ( @xcite ; the _ aia _ responses as a function of temperature can be obtained using the solarsoft routine aia_get_response ) , are dominated by  emission at the high temperature end ( @xmath8 \\gtrsim 6.5 $ ] ) , and by  for warm plasma ( @xmath8 \\sim 6 $ ] ) .",
    "however , recent studies support the presence of significant additional contributions to the 94  _ aia _ passband missing from current atomic databases ( e.g. , @xcite ; also , h.  warren , priv .",
