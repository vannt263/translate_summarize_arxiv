    "the concept of quantum graph @xcite serves as a laboratory to study quantum dynamics in situations when the configuration space has a complicated topology . at the same time",
    ", it is a useful tool in modelling numerous physical phenomena . to employ its full power , one should be able to understand the meaning of parameters associated with vertex coupling in such models , because one can typically associate many self - adjoint hamiltonians with the same graph .",
    "an old and natural idea was to select plausible ones with the help of `` fat - graph '' approximations ; it was formulated for the first time by ruedenberg and scherr @xcite who proposed a heuristic green - formula argument to demonstrate that such a shrinking limit would yield the simplest coupling conditions conventionally labelled as kirchhoff . after the interest to the problem",
    "had been renewed about twenty years ago a lot of effort was made to establish this limit rigorously , both for one - body schrdinger equation  @xcite and the ginzburg - landau dynamics @xcite .",
    "the idea of fat graph approximations has also been used in spectral geometry by  @xcite in order to show that the first non - vanishing eigenvalue of a compact manifold of dimension three or higher can have arbitrarily high multiplicity . moreover , ( rescaled ) fat graphs and their limits can be used in calculating spectral invariants  see  @xcite for a survey and  @xcite for an example of a graph with one edge and two vertices .",
    "we refer to the monograph  @xcite for a detailed discussion of these problems and an extensive bibliography .",
    "however , already in the seventies investigations of branched electromagnetic waveguides @xcite indicated that the low frequency behavior , closely linked to the shrinking limit , can be different for different geometries , and after geometrically induced states bound states in dirichlet tubes were discovered it became clear that the answer depends substantially on what boundary conditions one chooses for operators on the tube - like manifolds constructed over the graph `` skeleton '' , and that the limiting coupling may _ not _ be of the kirchhoff type @xcite .",
    "more recent investigations investigations have shown that this is typically the case for dirichlet tube networks , cf .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "an energy renormalisation is needed and when one chooses the natural one which consists of subtracting the lowest transverse eigenvalue which blows up when the tube diameter @xmath0 tends to zero , a nontrivial limit is achieved provided the fat graph from which one starts has a threshold resonance .",
    "it is natural to ask whether and how can a shrinking limit produce _ all _ the admissible vertex couplings .",
    "far from being a mere mathematical conundrum the problem is of practical importance .",
    "when building network - type objects one is primarily interested in control of the transport ; the possibility to manipulate the junction dynamics is one of the most direct ways to achieve this goal .",
    "methods to alternate transport properties of beam splitters by changing the junction geometry @xcite or material characteristics @xcite have been devised for photonic crystals , and it is only a matter of time when the fabrication technique progress will allow to address analogous technological challenges for networks of metallic nanowires or carbon nanotubes , modeled by by manifolds with neumann boundary conditions or without a boundary , respectively , or semiconductor ones for which dirichlet conditions are used .",
    "furthermore , some applications of junction control can be made more specific .",
    "for instance , cheon et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the generalized point interaction , i.e.  the simplest nontrivial graph with two edges and a general vertex coupling , as a model gate for quantum computing ; in a similar way other star graphs can model an arbitrary _ qudit_. the point is that the geometry of the eigenvalue manifolds of the corresponding operators is described by the group @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of the connected edges ; for a concrete way how the corresponding eigenvalue anholonomy can be used in grover search algorithm see , e.g.  @xcite . to implement such proposals with real - world objects ,",
    "a proper understanding of the junction dynamics is again essential .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide a complete solution to the problem for tubular network manifolds the boundary of which is either neumann or absent .",
    "the approximation we are going to construct has several ingredients .",
    "the first is the use of scaled potentials .",
    "if the network dynamics is described by the laplace - beltrami operator the limit leads to the kirchhoff coupling , hence one has to replace it by a suitable family of schrdinger operators .",
    "one proceeds at that in two steps , first an approximation is constructed on the graph itself and subsequently it is `` lifted '' to the tubular manifold . in this way we have been able in  @xcite to approximate",
    "two important coupling types usually referred to as @xmath3 and @xmath4 . referring to the graph approximation result obtained in @xcite we conjectured existence of such approximation to any vertex coupling with real coefficients which covers all the couplings invariant with respect to the time reversal .",
    "we are going to show here that one is not only able to prove the said conjecture but in fact can do better : following the `` algebraic '' work done in  @xcite we demonstrate here existence of a `` fat - graph '' approximation for _ all _ self - adjoint vertex couplings .",
    "the new idea here is to lift the indicated , quite subtle approximation from the metric graph level to fat graphs keeping a precise control of the estimates .",
    "let us recall briefly how the approximation constructed in  @xcite works , a detailed description will be given in section  [ sec : graphapprox ] below .",
    "it has several steps :    1 .",
    "we change locally the graph topology disconnecting the edges and connecting the loose ends by addition finite edges the length of which tends to zero .",
    "some of them may be missing , depending on the coupling we want to approximate 2 .",
    "the additional edges will be coupled to the original ones by @xmath3 conditions of the strength dependent on the approximation parameter .",
    "we also add a parameter - dependent @xmath3 interaction to the centre of these finite edges 3 .   in order to accommodate the couplings with non - real coefficients we add magnetic fields described by ( the tangent components of ) appropriate vector potentials , also dependent on the approximation parameter    the main result of this paper consists of `` lifting '' this approximation to tubular networks and demonstrating that one can approximate in this way any self - adjoint vertex coupling .",
    "since the approximation bears a local character we concentrate our attention on star graphs having a single vertex ; an extension to general graphs satisfying suitable uniformity conditions can be performed in the same way as in  @xcite .",
    "let us remark in addition that in contrast to the approximation of kirchhoff coupling by neumann laplacians on a tubular network the limit constructed in this paper is _ non - generic _ , cf .",
    "@xcite , and at the same time _",
    "non - unique_. an example of different limits for the same coupling will be mentioned in section  [ sec : ex.vx ] , and one can conjecture also existence of significantly different approximation schemes , in particular , purely geometric ones  @xcite .",
    "the result of the present paper thus allows us to make several conclusions . from the physics point of view",
    "it answers affirmatively the question whether one can approximate all the vertex couplings allowed by the sole requirement of probability current conservation , and at the same time , it suggests one possible construction to achieve this goal technically . on the mathematics side , approximations of different vertex couplings open interesting possibilities in connection with the mentioned use of fat graphs in calculating spectral invariants .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the next section , we outline the approximation procedure on the graph level . in section  [ sec : app.mfd ] , we construct the graph - like manifold model .",
    "moreover , we introduce the quadratic forms corresponding to our operators on the graph and the manifolds and relate them with the `` free '' operators , i.e the corresponding laplacians .",
    "in section  [ sec : conv.op ] we briefly recall the convergence of operators and forms acting in different hilbert spaces , apply the abstract conclusions to our situation here , and demonstrate our main result expressed in theorem  [ thm : main ] . in section  [ sec",
    ": ex ] , we present some examples , including the case of a metric graph embedded in @xmath5 when the manifold model is an @xmath0-neighbourhood of the graph .",
    "as we have indicated in the introduction the approximation is constructed in two steps .",
    "first we solve the problem on the graph level , and the obtained approximation is then `` lifted '' to network - type manifolds .",
    "the first part of this programme was realised in  @xcite and we summarise here the results as a necessary preliminary .    any self - adjoint coupling in a vertex of degree @xmath2 can be expressed through vertex conditions  one usually speaks about _ admissible _ conditions  which involve the boundary values @xmath6 .",
    "they are conventionally written in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 are @xmath9 matrices such that the @xmath10 matrix @xmath11 has maximum rank and @xmath12 is hermitian , cf .",
    "a pair @xmath13 describing a given coupling is naturally not unique and there are various ways how to remove the non - uniqueness , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the most suitable for our purpose is the one given by the following claim proved in @xcite ; it is simple but it requires an appropriate graph edge numbering .    [ prp : stform ] for a quantum graph vertex of degree @xmath2 , the following is valid : + [ .2em ] ( a ) if @xmath14 with @xmath15 is a hermitian matrix and @xmath16 , then the equation @xmath17 expresses admissible vertex conditions which make the graph laplacian a self - adjoint operator .",
    "+ [ .2em ] ( b ) conversely , for any self - adjoint vertex coupling there is a number @xmath15 and a numbering of edges such that the coupling is described by the conditions   with uniquely given matrices @xmath16 and @xmath18 . if the edge numbering is given one can bring the coupling into the form by a permutation @xmath19 of the edge indices with the matrices @xmath20 uniquely determined by the permutation @xmath21 .",
    "now we can describe the approximation of such a general vertex coupling . for simplicity",
    "we consider a star graph of @xmath2 semi - infinite edges ; in view of the proposition we may suppose that the wave functions are coupled according to   renaming the edges if necessary .",
    "the construction has two main ingredients .",
    "first of all , we have to change locally the graph topology , adding vertices to the graph as well as new edges which would shrink to zero in the limit . in this way one",
    "is able to get   with _ real _ matrices @xmath22 ; to overcome this restriction we need to introduce also local magnetic fields , i.e.  to place suitable vector potentials at the added edges .",
    "the construction is sketched in figure  [ fig : gen - approx ] ; we disconnect the edges of the star graph and connect their loose endpoints by line segments supporting appropriate operators according to the following rules :    ( 0,0 )   and @xmath23 .",
    "the inner edges are of length @xmath24 , some may be missing depending on the choice of the matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "the external semi - infinite edges of the approximating graph , each parametrised by @xmath35 are at their endpoints @xmath29 connected to the inner edges by @xmath3 coupling with the parameter @xmath36 for each @xmath37 ( see below ) .",
