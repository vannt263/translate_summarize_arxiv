    "due to the broadcast nature of the wireless medium in ieee 802.11b / g - based wireless mesh and ad hoc networks , each node may form many links with its neighbors in a large network .",
    "the links are formed based on the data rates and data packet sizes used for neighbor discovery . to achieve high connectivity and end - to - end throughput",
    ", nodes must adapt the link data rates and routes , respectively .",
    "wireless link quality , usually measured by packet delivery ratio ( pdr ) , is the fundamental metric by which data rate and route selection are optimized  @xcite .",
    "therefore , efficient and accurate link quality estimation ( lqe ) is pivotal to the effective operation of wireless networks .",
    "however , there are multiple factors that affect pdr , predominantly snr , shadowing , multipath , interference , and packet collisions , which make effective lqe challenging .",
    "previous results indicate that link quality can differ significantly with different propagation environments , e.g. indoor and outdoor  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , our investigation shows that all known lqe methods do not meet the required objectives : ( i ) to measure link quality efficiently , ( ii ) to adapt measurement result to a new environment , and ( iii ) maintain certain level of accurate throughout .",
    "the popular lqe methods are based on received packet count .",
    "usually beacon  @xcite or unicast  @xcite packets are sent periodically over each link .",
    "later , transmitters count the number of acknowledged packets from each receiver . due to the difference between data packets and probing packets , the neighbor discovery is inefficient and the lqe is inaccurate . among the newer lqe methods ,",
    "a promising approach is based on correlating snr levels with pdrs , as proposed independently in  @xcite .",
    "however the evaluation of this method is very limited and its potential unknown .",
    "the issue of lqe adaptation to a new network environment is not well discussed in the literature either .",
    "simply put , most of the lqe methods we are aware of are evaluated using limited network scenarios , e.g. with limited transmission rates , and in limited propagation environments  @xcite .",
    "the impact of the rate and route selections by different lqe methods are unknown .",
    "most importantly these methods have not been evaluated in real - world scenarios .",
    "some proposed lqe methods require additional hardware to work , like location devices  @xcite , which are usually not available in ieee 802.11 nodes .",
    "therefore , the objective is to design and evaluate , at the transport layer , a highly efficient lqe method .",
    "this method must be accurate , rapidly adaptable , environment aware , easily implementable in ieee 802.11 devices , imposing no additional requirements on the hardware .      in this paper",
    "we propose a novel environment aware lqe method based on snr maps and broadcast packet counts .",
    "snr map is a profile for each data rate of ieee 802.11b / g obtained by counting received packets for each observable snr value . even in the absence of traffic on a particular link",
    "the snr map allows for accurate lqe . for broadcast packet counting",
    "we propose to use an exponentially weighted moving average ( ewma ) filter to assess pdr .",
    "this significantly simplifies the implementation aspect of lqe , since only the information on the success of two recent transmissions is necessary .",
    "the two tier approach taken in our proposal , which combines the method of snr maps and broadcast packet counts , is directed by the fact that in certain environments one approach might be better than the other , as we show later in the paper .",
    "the two tier approach is the most flexible one , however , time requirements are quite high , so we mainly use snr maps in the rate adaptation and routing experiments in the paper",
    ". we present a simple analytical model to compare different lqe methods outlined in this paper against our proposed method .",
    "we show that our proposed snr profile method is the most efficient and accurate one in most scenarios .",
    "a key point to note is that our method is also able to determine the weight for the ewma filter in various environments .",
    "moreover , we propose a novel rate adaptation algorithm for ieee 802.11b / g networks using our proposed lqe method . the routing layer is adapted to incorporate our accurate lqe information and fast response rate adaptation scheme to have better route selection performance .",
    "this is because the rate adaptation and route selection are two important application of the lqe .",
    "better rate adaptation can also enhance the performance of the routing layer .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate the lqe with its applications together in the system level .",
    "we implement our proposed lqe and rate and route algorithms in hardware ; and compare its performance using different testbeds and in diverse scenarios with the traditional beacon packet - based lqe .",
    "we show over 50% improvement using the throughput metric based on transport layer performance assessment . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this paper is the pioneering work which both propose better lqe and demonstrate the enhancement from the system level ( including better rate adaptation and route selection ) performance evaluation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : related_work ] introduces the lqe classification , lqe applications , and the work related to our studies .",
    "section  [ sec : comparison ] presents a comparison framework of lqe methods described in section  [ sec : related_work ] .",
    "section  [ sec : proposed_system ] describes in detail our proposed rate and route selection system with novel lqe .",
    "the testbed and the prototype used to evaluate the proposed method is introduced in section  [ sec : implementation ] .",
    "the evaluation results are presented in section  [ sec : evaluation ] . finally the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in section  [ sec : introduction ] , we have briefly explained existing link quality metrics . in this section",
    "we look at the different lqe methods closely , which are needed to compare them formally against our proposed lqe method in section  [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "we also review the issues related to the application of lqe in rate adaptation and routing .",
    "lqe in ieee 802.11 wireless networks can be categorized into four major types , based on the information sources for the estimation : packet- , snr- , ber - based and the combination of those methods .",
    "the direct method to assess wireless link quality is to count the number of packets received over each link in the network for a predefined unit of time . for the results of pdr properties in wireless network",
    "see  @xcite . due to",
    "the different packet types used , packet - based lqe can itself be categorized into four methods : beacon packet- , broadcast packet- , unicast packet- and data packet - based .",
    "[ [ beacon - packet - based ] ] beacon packet - based + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the earliest method of lqe used beacon packets ( 40b broadcast packets sent at 2mbps rate , also known as `` hello '' packets ) to probe the link .",
    "expected transmission count ( etx )  @xcite and estimated transmission time ( ett )  @xcite are two beacon - based metrics .",
    "several works reported the inefficiency of this method due to the fundamental differences between beacon packets and data packets  @xcite . in some application ,",
    "every node need to periodically send the beacon to its neighbors for other reason than lqe , if the lqe method use this beacon , we can call it passive lqe , or else we call this lqe to be active lqe method .",
    "[ [ broadcast - packet - based ] ] broadcast packet - based + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to resolve the problem of beacon packet - based probing , nodes assessing pdr can broadcast packets equal in length to data packets , transmitted at any desired data rate .",
    "the overhead of this method is much higher than the beacon packet - based probing .",
    "this is because rate adaptation requires the link quality for all data rates and packet lengths .",
    "thus many test packets must be broadcasted to cover all use cases .",
    "[ [ unicast - packet - based ] ] unicast packet - based + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    an approach to solve the difference between broadcast probe packets and data packets transmitted in various data rates and sizes was to use unicast packets to probe the links  @xcite . in  @xcite a combination of broadcast and unicast packet probing was used .",
    "when no unicast traffic was passing through the link , broadcast packets were transmitted and used for lqe . a method for very short term lqe with unicast packets",
    "was proposed in  @xcite , while in  @xcite a mathematical model was developed to account for packet retransmissions within a single coherence time of time varying channel which could be used to predict the state of the link .",
    "we note that short term lqe is of limited use in real networks , since frequent lqe messages would saturate the routing process . in  @xcite",
    "authors use spatial correlation to predict the link quality and find that different pdr is observed for different locations . to implement this method in a real network , localization hardware would have to be supported by all devices .",
    "the most significant drawback of this method is the detrimental effect on network connectivity since the unicast packet will trigger more retransmissions which consume more network resources .    [",
    "[ data - traffic - based ] ] data traffic - based + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to alleviate the problems of probing with broadcast or unicast packets , authors in  @xcite proposed to use the latest data packets , flowing through the link and generated by the users , for estimation of pdr .",
    "better performance in terms of throughput is observed compared to broadcast - based probing , however , this lqe method considers only heavily loaded links . for lightly loaded links",
    "this method is ineffective and results in incomplete link state information for the network .",
    "yet another approach to estimate the link quality is to utilize ber information  @xcite .",
    "the estimation accuracy of this method is better than packet - based lqe since it conveys more information on the link quality and is retrieved directly from the physical layer .",
    "however , as indicated in  @xcite , this method causes significant overhead since it requires processing a large amount of data .",
    "ber information is not reported by commodity wireless cards which makes this method hard to implement on standard ieee 802.11 devices .",
    "this lqe method is of highest relevance in the context of this paper .",
    "the authors of etx noted that there was a low correlation between the snr observed over the packet counting interval and measured pdr  @xcite .",
    "this incorrect conclusion was a result of combining data measurements from different environments , receivers and links .",
    "it was later found that snr can actually be a good indicator of wireless link quality  @xcite .",
    "the snr - based lqe method was evaluated independently by the authors of this paper in  @xcite and others  @xcite .",
    "however , the accuracy of these method , except for  @xcite , were not compared to any other estimation method . moreover , except for  @xcite , a static snr to pdr mapping profile was used , thus adaptation to changing environments was not considered .",
    "authors in  @xcite proposed different metrics that correlated with packet delivery probability and used machine learning techniques to select the best metric in the lqe process .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that different rates in ieee 802.11 have different snr profiles , as pointed out in  @xcite , was not taken into account in the analysis .",
    "a separate discussion is needed for  @xcite , which is closest to our work .",
    "although a correlation between snr and pdr was well discussed , a piecewise linear approximation of this relation was used in rate adaptation process , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "7 ) , which loses throughput gain in transitional regions of snr map  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) . also , to obtain the snr map , the authors required a calibration process in which , unrealistically , an interference - free channel was assumed .",
    "further , the profiles were obtained by probing the link with very high intensity , i.e. 20ms of each second , which creates huge overhead for the device .",
    "but the most significant drawback of this method is the usage of beacon packet of different size than data packet to obtain snr profiles , which as we pointed out earlier , results in inaccurate rate adaptation .      since , individually , snr- and packet - based lqe have advantages and disadvantages , authors in  @xcite remarked to combine them for use depending on the environment and lqe accuracy .",
    "works in which such combined methods were proposed and evaluated independently were  @xcite .",
    "the estimator was a weighted function of the individual packet- and snr - based lqes .",
    "however , the metric had limited practical application since the weight had to be set individually for each environment and data rate , among others , and the learning process for the optimal weight involved the entire history of network operation .",
    "a qualitative comparison of all existing lqe methods is given in table  [ lqe_comparision ] .",
    "as noted earlier , in section  [ sec : comparison ] we propose a simple analytical framework to compare them quantitatively .",
    ".qualitative comparison of lqe methods ( desired performance : update ability  high , accuracy  high , overhead  low ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      experiments at the routing layer are needed to evaluate the overall efficiency of a link quality aware system .",
    "first in fig",
    ".  [ fig_result_route_mobile_instan ] we plot the throughput versus time for the rate adaptive scenario r1 .",
    "we can see that our proposed mechanism can outperform the current olsr implementation using ett . in the initial phase our mechanism tends to select better data rates which achieve greater single hop throughput .",
    "we can see from the hop chart ( bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig_result_route_mobile_instan ] ) that after 20s both mechanisms start to use the two - hop route . as observed previously , due to better selection of data rate the throughput with our method is also much higher than the packet counting based system .",
    "this can be seen as the transmitter moves towards the receiver ( between 60s and 80s ) .",
    "this is due to the slow reaction time of samplerate and the inaccurate lqe of ett .",
    "the packet counting based system still chose a 2-hop route even when the distance between the transmitter and receiver is less than that between the transmitter and intermediate node .",
    "this results in much worse performance than our proposed link quality aware system .",
    "the results of experiments in r2 are given in fig .",
    "[ fig_result_route_stationary_3pillar ] .",
    "we can see that in this situation our proposed mechanism performs better than olsr with ett .",
    "when the receiver was node 2 or node 3 , only one or two hops were traversed .",
    "due to the fact that the connection between node 1 and the sender is not satisfactory , either a one or two hop route between the receiver and sender will result in decreased throughput .",
    "an interesting behavior is seen for node 4 which is supposed to achieve the lowest throughput due to its greatest distance from the sender . in this case",
    "the samplerate - based olsr performs better than our proposed system while both of them outperform node 3 and node 2 in terms of throughput .",
    "this is presumably due to sudden link breaks that decreased temporarily the throughput to zero , which resulted in fixed routing outperforming our proposed lqe - based routing .    the results of experiments for the scenario r3",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_result_route_stationary_4pillar ] . similar to the results in r2 ,",
    "the first node uses a one hop route to the sender and the performance of our algorithm is a little better than the classic olsr due to the same reason as described for r2 .",
    "however , when the receiver moves further away from the sender ( nodes 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively ) , our method performs even better and the throughput is much higher than in the samplerate based olsr . based on the results for the stationary scenarios , r2 and r3 ,",
    "our proposed system generally selects a better data rate and route based on more accurate link quality information and achieves higher end - to - end throughput .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a new lqe method to overcome the deficiencies of the existing methods viz . , accuracy , adaptability , environment awareness , ease of implementation and efficiency .",
    "we compared our proposed method with two general packet counting based methods in different scenarios .",
    "based on a detailed comparison , the snr profile based lqe has the advantage of high accuracy and low overhead , as shown via an analytical model . to overcome estimation inaccuracies due to environment changes , we proposed an updating mechanism for the snr profile .",
    "measurement results show the effectiveness of the profile updates , which suggest that the snr profile based lqe can be a general lqe method used in all environments .",
    "results have been presented indicating that our method generally selects a better rate and achieves higher throughput even in challenging , i.e. mobile , scenarios .",
    "further , each of the procedures presented in the paper can be executed in polynomial time making it easily implementable .",
    "we also used our proposed lqe method in the link quality aware data rate selection and routing mechanism .",
    "our measurements indicate that our proposed system improves two aspects : ( i ) per - link throughput , and ( ii ) faster and better route selection .",
    "these improvements are mainly because of faster and better rate selection procedures and lqe .",
    "the next task in our roadmap is to further reduce the error for lqe by combining both snr profiling and packet counting methods .",
    "we intend to input the data from our measurement to a network simulation to verify further the performance of our methods . through simulation",
    "we can test many scenarios and evaluate more metrics like scalability .",
    "further in the roadmap , we shall extend our work to consider multiple packet sizes and improve the performance in rate selection to select better data rate .",
    "also , self optimization work will be performed to let the system self - optimize the performance and decide the different @xmath0 values .",
