    "magnetic ordering in yb - based intermetallic compounds is quite rare .",
    "there are generally two reasons for that : i ) in many of these materials , the yb atom has a valence close to + 2 , which implies a zero or a very weak @xmath13-shell magnetic moment ; ii ) if the valence is close to + 3 , a strong hybridisation between the localised @xmath13 and the conduction electrons , i.e. the kondo effect , can progressively screen the yb magnetic moments and leave a non - magnetic ground state .",
    "one of the most studied examples of the latter category is ybrh@xmath1si@xmath1 , where a kondo temperature @xmath14  k has been estimated from the magnetic entropy and an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order state has been found just below @xmath15  k  @xcite . in this particular material ,",
    "the very low transition temperature made it possible to study the unconventional behaviour of the thermodynamic and transport properties caused by a novel type of quantum critical fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the real nature of these fluctuations may be observed directly in the magnetic response @xmath16 , measured by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) .",
    "these experiments require a certain knowledge of the magneticcally ordered structure below @xmath8 , e.g. , the ordering wave vector @xmath17 .",
    "+ in ybrh@xmath1si@xmath1  the structure of the ordered phase is still unknown .",
    "this is mainly due to experimental problems : limited size of the single crystals ( @xmath18  mm@xmath19 ) , low @xmath8 and also an unexpectedly very small ordered moment  @xcite . to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "ins experiments should be carried out under pressure , since @xmath8 and the corresponding ordered moment increase with increasing pressure in yb - based compounds  @xcite .",
    "however , such experiments have not been successful yet , mainly because of the reasons listed above .",
    "+ another way to approach the problem is using chemical pressure ; isoelectronic substitution of rh by co leads to a similar effect as pressure  @xcite .",
    "recently , the crystal growing process has been optimised in order to produce single crystals of yb(rh@xmath20co@xmath21si@xmath1 , which all crystallise in the tetragonal thcr@xmath1si@xmath1-type structure : several high - quality single crystals with a co content @xmath22 varying between 0.03 and 1 have been synthesised  @xcite .",
    "as expected , increasing @xmath22 stabilises magnetic order , enhancing @xmath8 and the value of the ordered moment .",
    "+ the main aim of our study is to investigate the magnetically ordered state in the yb(rh@xmath20co@xmath21si@xmath1  series , starting with ybco@xmath1si@xmath1 , and to try to get as much information as possible about the ordered state in ybrh@xmath1si@xmath1 . in this contribution , we present the first low - temperature study of the magnetic @xmath12 phase diagram of ybco@xmath1si@xmath1 , obtained by dc - magnetisation measurements .",
    "+ the first evidence of magnetic order in ybco@xmath1si@xmath1  has been observed by  hodges in @xmath23yb mssbauer spectroscopy experiments  @xcite .",
    "he found afm order below 1.7  k with the easy magnetisation along the basal plane and a saturated moment of @xmath24/yb .",
    "his results could be explained in terms of a yb@xmath25 valence state experiencing a tetragonal crystalline electrical field ( cef ) .",
    "ins experiments have unambiguously demonstrated that yb is trivalent at high temperatures and that the kramers doublet ground state is 4  mev away from the first excited state  @xcite .",
    "magnetic susceptibility @xmath6 , plotted as a function of @xmath26 for small ( a ) and large ( b ) fields .",
    "@xmath8 indicates the upper afm transition temperature and @xmath10 indicates the lower one . ]",
    "this agrees well with our high - temperature susceptibility measurements , which follow a curie - weiss behaviour with an effective moment of @xmath27/yb and a weiss temperature @xmath28 of -4  k and -160  k for magnetic field @xmath2 parallel and perpendicular to the basal plane , respectively .",
    "no magnetic contribution from co has been observed  @xcite",
    ". a similar fit at temperatures between 2 and 4  k leads to a reduced effective moment of @xmath29/yb .",
    "an exact analysis of the cef level scheme , that might match all previously mentioned results , is needed .",
    "our data will help to solve the cef hamiltonian by providing the values of the saturation magnetisation .",
    "+ the sample investigated here has a residual resistance ratio of 2 at 0.35  k and a mass of 35  mg .",
    "its shape is surprisingly square , with sides parallel to the crystallographic direction [ 100 ] , which made it easy to align the sample . in this paper",
    ", our study focuses on measurements with @xmath30 [ 100 ] .",
    "the dc magnetisation @xmath0 and susceptibility @xmath6 has been measured with a high - resolution faraday magnetometer , in magnetic fields as high as 4  t and temperatures down to 0.05  k  @xcite .",
    "owing to the magnetic anisotropy of ybco@xmath1si@xmath1  ( a factor of about 4  @xcite ) , the sample platform has been modified so as to reduce the torque contribution to the raw signal , which is proportional to the magnetisation perpendicular to the applied field .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the temperature dependence of the susceptibility in several fields . at a small field of 0.1  t",
    "two features can be seen ( indicated by arrows ) : a sharp kink at @xmath31  k and a distinct drop at @xmath32  k. at @xmath8 afm order sets it and possibly assumes a different afm structure below @xmath10 .",
    "while the phase transition at @xmath8 is @xmath7 order , the sudden drop at @xmath10 and the latent heat observed in the heat capacity in zero field indicates the @xmath9 order nature of the phase transition ; the entropy above both transitions suggests a local character of the yb @xmath13 quasi - hole , pointing to a very low kondo temperature @xmath33  k , compared to that of ybrh@xmath1si@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "both , @xmath8 and @xmath10 , shift to lower temperatures with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "it should be noticed , that at fields higher than 0.1  t , the sharp cusp at @xmath8 changes into a plateau where @xmath34 remains almost constant ( cf .",
    "curve at @xmath35  t ) .",
    "the phase transition at @xmath8 seems to split in field , as can be deduced by the points in the @xmath12 phase diagram of figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the lower transition becomes broader in @xmath26 as the external field is enhanced above 0.7  t , and , at @xmath36  t , disappears .",
    "a field of about 2  t is necessary to suppress @xmath8 to zero , where @xmath37 becomes nearly constant . to investigate the phase transition lines in more detail , we measured the field dependence of @xmath0 at different temperatures .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "frame ( a ) : @xmath0 vs @xmath2 at the lowest accessible temperature of 0.05  k and at 2  k , just above @xmath8 . in the inset",
    "we zoom on the metamagnetic - like transition to emphasise the hysteresis loop .",
    "frame ( b ) : @xmath0 vs @xmath2 at 0.5 , 0.65 and 0.8  k. the two metamagnetic - like transitions visible at 0.5  k join each other to become one at 0.65  k and split again at 0.8  k. this feature is accentuated in @xmath38 ( in form of peaks ) plotted in the inset . ]",
    "the isotherm at 0.05  k shows two metamagnetic - like steps at about 0.65  t and 0.85  t , followed by a kink at @xmath39  t , which is associated with the transition at @xmath8 .",
    "measuring @xmath0 , while sweeping the field up and down , a tiny hysteresis is observed across the first two phase transitions , whereas at @xmath40 the transition seems to be continuous .",
    "these signatures emphasise the @xmath9 and @xmath7 order nature of the phase lines . at a slightly higher temperature @xmath41",
    "k , the hysteresis vanishes . by further increasing @xmath26",
    ", the two steps merge into one at 0.65  k and afterwards split again at 0.8  k. this is well illustrated in the inset of figure  [ fig2 ]  ( b ) , where the derivative @xmath42 is plotted as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we determined the critical fields of the metamagnetic - like transitions as the fields corresponding to the maxima of the derivative .",
    "the points obtained in this way are depicted as circles in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the value of the magnetisation just above @xmath40 is 1.4  @xmath43yb , which is in agreement with the saturated moment calculated by hodges  @xcite , and enforces the hypothesis of the local character of the yb @xmath13 quasi - holes . above @xmath40 ,",
    "@xmath0 increases further , possibly because of the van vleck contributions to @xmath0 .     magnetic phase diagram of ybco@xmath1si@xmath1  with @xmath30  [ 100 ] .",
    "the square and circle points have been extracted from isofield and isothermal measurements of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "pm indicates the paramagnetic region while afm the antiferromagnatic one .",
    "the four different afm phases are labeled from i to iv .",
    "the full line represents the fit performed with the elliptical curve : @xmath44^{n}+[t / t_{n}(0)]^{n } = 1 $ ] where @xmath45  k , @xmath46  t and @xmath47 . ]",
    "the magnetic phase diagram is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the squares and circles indicate phase transitions observed in @xmath0 vs @xmath26 and @xmath0 vs @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the outer @xmath7 order phase - transition boundary line , which separates the afm from the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase , can be followed from 1.75  k in zero field up to a critical field of 1.9  t , which denotes a potential quantum critical point .",
    "the data along this line can well be described by an elliptical curve : @xmath44^{n}+[t / t_{n}(0)]^{n } = 1 $ ] with n = 1.9 , @xmath48  k and @xmath46  t ( full line in figure  [ fig3 ] ) . inside the magnetic phase , four afm regions can be identified .",
    "firstof all , the line associated to @xmath8 seems to split in field separating the reagion afm  ii and iv by a @xmath7 order phase transition .",
    "all other phase boundaries between afm i and iii appear to be @xmath9 order line . at first glance",
    ", we might interpret our data as follows :",
    "region ii is characterised by afm order with an incommensurable arrangement of the moments , which then assumes a commensurable structure in region i through a @xmath9 order phase transition . by applying a magnetic field along [ 100 ]",
    ", the moments arrangement undergoes metamagnetic - like transitions into a canted structure , which only become fully polarised above 1.9  t. + to extract the magnetic wave vector @xmath17 of the ordered phase and its evolution in field , neutron scattering experiments are on the way . for the time being , the magnetic phase diagram for field parallel to all three magnetic non - equivalent crystallographic directions ( [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] ) will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
