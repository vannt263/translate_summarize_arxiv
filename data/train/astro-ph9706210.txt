    "the case for dark matter in galaxies rests primarily on those spiral galaxies where the hi rotation curve has been measured at radii which are several times larger than the optical disk . at these large radii ,",
    "the observed rotation of the gas is fully a factor of two larger than that expected for circular orbits in the potential field of the luminous galaxy ( van albada  1985 ) .",
    "many of these extensive rotation curves are flat or even rising at the outermost points which means the edge of the mass distribution has not yet been found ( puche & carignan 1991 ) . in an attempt to find the edge ,",
    "several observers have pushed their hi observations to higher sensitivity ( van gorkom 1993 ; corbelli  1989 ) .",
    "these observations have shown that hi disks are abruptly truncated at column densities near 10@xmath3 atoms @xmath4 where the rotation curves are still flat .",
    "one possible explanation for the truncation is that , at large radii , the thin hi disks become fully ionized by the metagalactic uv background ( bochkarev & sunyaev 1977 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the outer parts of gaseous disks should be emitting h@xmath0 photons .",
    "maloney ( 1993 ) has shown that the expected h@xmath0 emission measure from the ionized disk beyond the truncation point falls in the range 0.0250.25 @xmath5 pc . after demonstrating that these flux levels are quite feasible with the taurus-2 fabry - perot interferometer ( bland - hawthorn  1994 , hereafter btvs )",
    ", we now use this technique to search for the signature of ionized gas at and beyond the hi edge in sculptor spirals .",
    "the implications of a positive detection are profound .",
    "if the outer disk could be detected , then we would firstly know how extensive galactic disks ( and dark haloes ) really are and , secondly , we could continue tracking the rotation curve in order to find the edge of the halo and hence find the total mass of galaxies .",
    "a positive detection also has important implications for explaining low redshift ly@xmath0 absorption - line systems towards quasars , and for constraining the poorly known metagalactic ionizing background .    in @xmath62",
    ", we describe the observations carried out at the aat . in @xmath63",
    ", we derive the expected level of  emission at an hi edge , and then describe the experimental procedure to achieve such faint detections .",
    "the reduction and analysis steps are briefly outlined in @xmath64 , the results of which are discussed in @xmath65 . in @xmath66 , we attempt a physical interpretation of both the gas kinematics and the gas excitation before drawing our conclusions in @xmath67 .",
    "the observations were carried out over three long dark nights ( 1994 aug 9@xmath712 ) at the f/7.91 cassegrain focus of the aat 3.9 m .",
    "follow - up observations were carried out at f/14.9 on 1995 sep 27 .",
    "the taurus-2 interferometer was used in conjunction with the refurbished hifi 40@xmath8 m gap queensgate etalon and a 4@xmath7cavity blocking filter ( 90% peak transmission ) , centered at @xmath96555 , with a 45   bandpass well matched to the etalon free spectral range ( 54.3  at h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the 50 mm filter was placed out of focus close to the focal plane and baffled to give a 5.0  field .",
    "the etalon was tilted by 3.4  to shift the optical axis to the field edge .",
    "an in - focus , focal plane , colander mask was used to ensure that low - order ghosts fall outside the field of view .",
    "the taurus-2 f/8 pupil diameter is 59.9 mm which is oversized for the the 50 mm diameter etalon . due to uncertainties of the precise location of the optical cavity within the etalon , we placed a 45.0 mm aperture stop immediately in front of the etalon .",
    "the pupil stop introduced a major loss of light ( 50% ) compounded by a cassegrain hole which is 17% of the total pupil area .",
    "the full pupil was used in the f/15 observations .",
    "the observational set - up was the same except for a 75 mm blocking filter centered at 6585  which was not baffled thereby producing a field of view similar to the f/8 observations .",
    "observations were made at four positions in ngc 253 ( plates 1 and 2 ) with several discrete tunings of the etalon at each position ( table 1 ) .",
    "the etalon was used at fixed gap spacings and the resulting ring pattern was imaged onto a tek 1024@xmath10 ccd with pixel scales of 0.594  pix@xmath11 ( f/8 ) and 0.315  pix@xmath11 ( f/15 ) with read noise @xmath12 2.3e@xmath13 .",
    "the wavelength range @xmath14 is dispersed quadratically over the 5  field at 1  resolution with blue wavelengths to the north .",
    "the instrument and detector were rotated to a position angle of 230  to align the detector with the galaxy major axis . at both foci , we observed two stellar flux standards ( table 1 ) ; at f/8 , we also observed four planetary nebulae .",
    "observations were also made of blank fields and in the direction of the smith high velocity cloud ( smith 1963 ; wakker 1991 ) , and twilight flats were taken on all nights with and without the etalon .",
    "we now derive the expected flux levels from spiral edges ionized by a metagalactic radiation field .",
    "the surface density of hi gas falls exponentially in spiral galaxies .",
    "a point is reached where the hi column is no longer able to support itself against ionization by the cosmic radiation field .",
    "a nave calculation can be used to predict the expected column density  at which this is likely to occur , in addition to the local electron density , , and the expected emission measure , .",
    "more sophisticated treatments are given in maloney ( 1993 ) and dove & shull ( 1994 ) .",
    "we shall assume that , at large galactocentric radius , the ionization rate is in rough equilibrium with the rate of recombination .",
    "therefore , along an axis @xmath15 perpendicular to the galactic disk , we find @xmath16 where the recombination coefficient  depends on the neutral hydrogen column and the local electron temperature ( case b : @xmath17 @xmath18 s@xmath11 at t@xmath19k ) . the local electron density  ( and therefore the proton density ) ,",
    "is related to the neutral hydrogen density , , through the ionizing fraction @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .",
    "equation  [ ion_balance ] assumes that the neutral gas sheet is ionized from both sides .",
    "we approximate the cosmic ionizing flux level as @xmath22 where  is the metagalactic flux at the lyman limit ( @xmath23 ) in units of .",
    "if the cosmic ionizing field ( e.g. haardt & madau 1996 ) is due largely to quasars at high redshift , @xmath24 is approximately unity .    for an exponential disk with density profile @xmath25 ,",
    "the electron density in the plane of the galaxy at the ionized edge is @xmath26 where the vertical scale height of the disk @xmath27 is in parsecs .",
    "we assume a value of @xmath28 pc throughout .",
    "the particle column density perpendicular to the disk is @xmath29 for a @xmath30 upper limit of @xmath31 ( vogel   1995 ; bland - hawthorn 1997 ) , the gas is fully ionized when @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath4 .",
    "the latter is in good agreement with observations ( e.g. corbelli   1989 ) .",
    "a crude upper limit on the  emission measure  is @xmath35 this surface brightness , equivalent to 90 millirayleighs ( mr ) and @xmath36 erg @xmath4 s@xmath11 arcsec@xmath37 , is reached at the 3@xmath38 level by the fabry - perot ` staring ' technique in less than one hour of observation ( btvs ) .",
    "s@xmath11 sr@xmath11 or 2.41@xmath3910@xmath40 erg @xmath4 s@xmath11 sr@xmath11 at . ]",
    "we exploit the ` staring ' technique to obtain a single , extremely deep spectrum of a diffuse source which fills the field of view . for a fixed gap spacing , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the angle of an incoming ray of wavelength @xmath9 to the optical axis .",
    "the spectrum in a narrow band ( @xmath4340 ) is dispersed radially from the optical axis across the field ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . like long - slit spectrometers ,",
    "the instrumental profile is projected onto the detector but the line fwhm in pixels varies across the field inversely with @xmath42 .",
    "complete fabry - perot rings have constant surface brightness and equal spectroscopic resolution .",
    "after flatfielding and point source removal , the data are binned azimuthally and resampled to a linear axis to obtain a single deep spectrum ( e.g. figs . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "maximum sensitivity is achieved when ( a ) the detector covers the unvignetted field , ( b ) the line - emitting source fills the field of view , and ( c ) the velocity range and internal kinematic dispersion , taken together , are comparable to the instrumental profile width .",
    "these criteria determine which galaxies are best matched to a given instrument .",
    "the isovelocity contours of a disk undergoing flat rotation show two distinct regimes .",
    "the central region of solid body rotation gives rise to contours which are parallel to the kinematic minor axis . at the turnover radius ,",
    "the contours become radial and therefore subtend a fixed angle as seen on the sky about the kinematic major axis . the spread in velocity within a fixed field of view declines inversely with radius until we reach the intrinsic spread of an isothermal hi disk ( @xmath12 10 ; kamphuis 1993 ) .",
    "an important concept is the angular extent of the `` innermost monochromatic field '' ( imf ) for a given instrument , telescope and object .",
    "we define this as the field at the smallest radius along the disk major axis within which the observed spread in velocities does not exceed the instrumental resolution .",
    "the necessary condition for a galaxy with maximum deprojected velocity  inclined at an angle @xmath44 is @xmath45^{-1 } + \\sigma^2_{\\rm hi}\\ \\   \\leq\\ \\",
    "\\sigma^2_{\\rm fp}\\ ] ] where  is the instrumental width ( in ) and @xmath46 is the radius to the field center ( in kpc )",
    ". truncated hi edges typically occur at radii larger than the semi - major axis distance (  in kpc ) of the @xmath47 mag arcsec@xmath37 contour . for a fixed field  ( in kpc ) , this condition is most easily satisfied in large , nearby galaxies where the instrument field of view is a small fraction of the object size .",
    "the constant @xmath8 allows for two different approaches to sky subtraction . if this is achieved through a separate exposure , @xmath48",
    "; otherwise , in a properly matched experiment , we assume that half the field is given over to the sky background for which @xmath49 .",
    "the optimal disk inclination is unclear : face - on galaxies have a smaller velocity spread and subtend larger solid angles , whereas an inclined disk has a higher projected column density .",
    "a potential problem in edge - on disks is flaring due to the declining stellar surface density ( olling 1995 ) which tends to reduce the projected emission measure . to minimize the velocity spread , we rotate the instrument so that the incomplete ring pattern is convex in the same sense as the projected velocity field , and is centered on the kinematic major axis ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of the many subtleties of data analysis are to be presented elsewhere ; a brief overview is given here .",
    "an important step is establishing the optical axis of the incomplete calibration rings to better than 0.1 pix .",
    "this was achieved with orthogonal distance regression ( e.g. boggs , byrd & schnabel 1987 ) .",
    "next , we azimuthally bin the calibration rings for all nights to ensure that ( a ) there were no opto - mechanical shifts , ( b ) the instrumental response was constant , and ( c ) the etalon gap zero - point was constant from night to night . in ( b ) , the etalon was found to behave reliably except that there was a slow drift in the optical gap during the first night .",
    "some calibration spectra showed baseline variations after binning over different parts of the field .",
    "this arises from illumination ( vignette ) effects , stray light , chip structure and ccd fringeing which can be divided out reliably with flatfields .",
    "the spectral bandpass seen by individual pixels is roughly 1  where the bandpass centroid declines by 40  from the optical axis to the field edge .",
    "twilight flats were found to be the most reliable except that the fraunhofer spectrum leaves its imprint in the data .",
    "we divide out the solar spectrum from the flatfield by establishing the mean spectrum and then generating a polar image with this spectrum . occasionally , the flatfields leave residual fringe structure in the data .",
    "it is possible to remove this with azimuthal smoothing but potentially informative , intensity variations in the data will be washed out .",
    "ccd fringeing constitutes the main systematic error in diffuse detection and provides a major challenge to achieving deeper detection limits than that quoted by btvs .",
    "the response of the blocking filter is removed in the twilight division .    to obtain discrete spectra from the summed ccd images ,",
    "the data were divided into annular rings two pixels wide . within each annulus",
    ", we can calculate the mean , median or mode of the histogram .",
    "cosmic ray events appear as outliers and are therefore easily removed .",
    "we tried more sophisticated methods ( e.g. the bi - weight statistic ) but the improvement was found to be marginal .",
    "the weak underlying galaxy continuum observed in ngc 253 had only a negligible effect on the final spectra .",
    "this was examined by subtracting a matching @xmath46 band exposure modulated by the polar response of the blocking filter .",
    "this same image was used to identify unresolved sources within the field .",
    "sky subtraction is particularly hazardous since atmospheric humidity produces variable water vapour features .",
    "if the object fills the field of view , as for ngc 253 , it is necessary to obtain off - field exposures at the same airmass and at comparable humidity . the oh lines are time variable but , most importantly , they vary with the zenith angle of the observation ( kondratyev 1969 ) .",
    "this is quite distinct from the geocoronal lines which reach a minimum at local midnight rising sharply towards dawn .",
    "the night sky lines allow for wavelength calibration to better than 0.04  ( osterbrock & martel 1992 ) as shown by the difference in wavelength produced by a discharge lamp and solar ly@xmath24 resonance excitation of the exosphere ( yelle & roesler 1985 ) .",
    "the velocity centroid of the galactic  emission ( ` reynolds layer ' ) , using new wavelengths from spyromilio ( 1995 ) , provides an independent measurement of the earth - sun motion with respect to the local standard of rest .",
    "for all four nights , the conditions were consistently photometric as judged by the reynolds layer emission .",
    "the photometric calibration was achieved using both line and continuum flux standards ( table 1 ) .",
    "the four taurus-2 field positions are shown in figs . 1 and 2 overlaid on a @xmath50 image of ngc 253 and the deepest hi image to date for this galaxy .",
    "a magnified section of one interferogram is shown in fig .",
    "3 and summed spectra are shown for the two outermost fields in figs . 4 and 5 . the ` staring ' method allows for an extremely deep spectroscopic detection over pixels that fall within the projected arc defined by a discrete frequency .",
    "there are two frequencies of interest so that kinematic measurements are possible at two positions within each field .",
    "the etalon was tuned to two different spacings for the two innermost fields so that we have kinematic measurements at no more than 12 independent positions along the major axis .",
    "these data are presented in figs .",
    "6 and 7 .",
    "optical line emission is detected in all field positions . in fields sw1 and sw2 , bright hii regions were clearly seen in both  and .",
    "these short exposures were taken to establish independently the systemic velocity of the gas .",
    "the kinematic measurements are seen in fig .",
    "6@xmath51 at @xmath52 .",
    "the large systematic errors in both axes are due to azimuthally averaging over a large spread in velocities and radial distances within the projected plane at small galaxian radii .",
    "field sw3 is the imf defined by the criterion in equation  [ imf ] .",
    "weak stellar continuum emission is seen over the central third of the field extending from roughly  @xmath53 23 mag arcsec@xmath37 ( ne ) to 25 mag arcsec@xmath37 ( sw ) .",
    "the  and  line emission comprise clumpy structure superimposed on a faint diffuse component . only two of the sources are unresolved : these show up on our matched @xmath54 images and are labelled in fig .",
    "3 . the two bright knots at the position of the  line are probably faint hii regions .    the summed spectrum for field sw3 is shown fig .",
    "the difference of the on - object and off - object spectra clearly shows the declining stellar disk along the major axis , in addition to the  and   lines at 6557.7  and 6572.8 . while these lines fall at different spatial locations within the galaxy , the strength of the blue   line with respect to  is striking , a result which holds after removing the bright knots .",
    "the weakness of the galaxy continuum rules out a significant correction to the  line flux due to stellar absorption ( bica & alloin 1987 ) .",
    "we achieved the same basic result in the 1995 september 27 observations although the signal - to - noise ratio was roughly half that of the earlier observations .",
    "both sets of observations show that the diffuse emission peaks towards the major axis .",
    "the summed spectrum for field sw4 is presented in fig .",
    "this field lies beyond the hi edge of ngc 253 .",
    "unfortunately , we did not manage to obtain a matching sky observation .",
    "the data clearly show weak emission and possibly broad diffuse  emission . we have attempted to subtract something approximating a background spectrum by dividing up the field into three vertical panels which have equal area when the outer panels are taken together .",
    "the central section constitutes our on - object spectrum , the outer quarter panels our off - object spectrum .",
    "the weak outer envelope of the galaxy is seen in the difference spectrum .",
    "the  emission peaks towards the major axis and is not detected in the outermost panels .",
    "broad diffuse  emission is seen in both regions at comparable intensity and therefore subtracts cleanly in the residual spectrum . that this feature is real",
    "can be seen by comparing the lower spectrum in fig .",
    "5 with the off - object spectrum in fig . 4 where such a feature is not seen .    the radial velocities for the emission lines in figs .",
    "4 and 5 were corrected for the earth s motion before subtracting the systemic velocity of ngc 253 .",
    "these measurements are presented in figs . 6 and 7 .",
    "the innermost taurus-2 measurements were used to establish the systemic velocity of the ionized gas .",
    "schommer  ( 1993 ) show the systematic uncertainties which can arise between hi and ionized gas kinematics .",
    "our optical determination ( @xmath55 ) is consistent with the weighted - average hi measurements ( 249@xmath568 ) from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database .",
    "we adopt the hi value 245@xmath565   ( puche  1991 , hereafter pcvg ) as we wish to relate the optical data to their data .",
    "for the measurements between @xmath57  and @xmath58 , the kinematic error is dominated by the uncertainty in systemic velocity .",
    "the smaller error bars compared to the inner taurus-2 measurements reflect the smaller intrinsic radial and kinematic dispersion . that the optical values appear systematically high by 10",
    "is discussed in the next section . for the outermost point",
    ", the diffuse broad feature has a large kinematic measurement uncertainty . unlike the other lines , this feature has fairly uniform intensity over the full field .",
    "its lack of continuity with the other measurements calls into question its association with the galaxy .",
    "the major axis measurements in ngc 253 pose an interesting problem . in fig . 6 , the `` rotation curve '' appears to flatten off before rising at a radius @xmath59 .",
    "this effect is seen for both the approaching and receding sides of the disk , with ( fig .",
    "6@xmath60 ) or without ( fig .",
    "6@xmath61 ) the correction for orbit inclination . in fig .",
    "6@xmath51 , the taurus-2 measurements confirm and extend this trend out to @xmath62 .",
    "the outer taurus-2 values are somewhat higher than the azimuthally averaged hi rotation curve , but this is a distinctive feature of the approaching side of the disk ( fig .",
    "6@xmath61 ) in that the outer hi measurements here are higher than average .    if we assume that the distribution of mass has spherical symmetry , then from poisson s equation , @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the local mass density and the circular velocity . for the flat region of @xmath65 ,",
    "@xmath64 declines as @xmath66 ; the sudden rise requires the density profile to become much flatter or even constant with increasing radius .",
    "a slightly flattened potential gives the same result although the inferred total mass will be overestimated in this case .",
    "the inflexion in the rotation curve can be understood naturally to arise from the potential of an exponential stellar disk with a much larger dark halo ( e.g. carignan & freeman 1985 ) . to illustrate this",
    ", we show a variety of possible 3-component fits to the data .    in the first model ( fig .",
    "7@xmath61 ) , the hi and stellar disks have the same form . the dark halo is represented by an isothermal sphere , which is fully specified by any two of the halo central density , @xmath67 , the central velocity dispersion @xmath68 , or the core radius @xmath69 .",
    "the stellar disk is specified by a central surface density @xmath70 and a scale length @xmath71 .",
    "the hi surface density profile is given in pcvg ( fig .",
    "5 ) ; the central hole within @xmath72 causes the gravitational force due to the gas to be directed outward ( e.g. staveley - smith  1990 ) .",
    "we have taken @xmath68 @xmath53 253 , @xmath73 kpc , @xmath74  kpc@xmath37 and @xmath75 kpc .",
    "these values compare well with pcvg except that the disk and halo scale lengths are 30% smaller than their values . in order to match the observed data ,",
    "the model rotation curves have been projected to a plane inclined at 72 .",
    "we note that such a large core radius is normal for the dark halo of large disk galaxies ( freeman 1993 ) .    in the second model ( fig .",
    "7@xmath60 ) , the radial forms of the disk and halo are given by dehnen & binney ( 1997 ) .",
    "for the halo , we adopt @xmath76 with @xmath77 the halo parameters are the halo density normalization , @xmath78 , the halo scale radius , @xmath79 , the outer cut - off radius , @xmath80 , and the inner and outer power slopes @xmath81 and @xmath60 . apart from the halo axis ratio ( @xmath82 ) , all of these parameters were obtained from a fit to the rotation curve .",
    "both the stellar and gaseous disks are assumed to be exponential in form , i.e. @xmath83 for each of the disks , the adopted parameters are the surface density normalization , @xmath84 , the disk scale height , @xmath85 , and the disk scale radius and inner cut - off radius , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . for the hi disk , these were fixed at @xmath88   kpc@xmath37 , @xmath89 kpc , @xmath90 kpc , and @xmath91 kpc . for the stellar disk , @xmath92 kpc , @xmath93 kpc , and @xmath94 kpc as suggested by the photometry .",
    "the surface density normalization for the stellar disk was obtained from the least - squares fit .",
    "the fit , kindly undertaken by w. dehnen , ignored the last taurus-2 measurement to yield the following results : @xmath95  kpc@xmath37 , @xmath96   kpc@xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 kpc and @xmath101 kpc .",
    "of these , @xmath60 was constrained to be greater than or equal to unity .",
    "7@xmath60 shows that the rising halo contribution to the rotation curve gives a better fit to the data overall .",
    "but there are strong correlations between the various parameters and the fitted results depend critically on which of the taurus-2 points are included .",
    "the outermost taurus-2  measurement in figs .",
    "6@xmath51 and 7 suggests that the rotation curve may be falling beyond a radius of about 10 kpc , but there are certainly other possible explanations for its low observed velocity .",
    "for example , _",
    "( i ) _  it may result from tidal distortion of the outermost regions of ngc 253 , or _",
    "( ii ) _  from accretion of a faint gas - rich object at large radius . in support of the accretion idea ,",
    "a stacked photographic image by d. malin shows extended stellar light at faint levels ( @xmath4326 mag arcsec@xmath37 ) to the sw of the disk ; similar emission is not seen to the ne . _ ( iii ) _  while the emission may arise from an outer ionized envelope , it is conceivable that this emission is associated with the group itself .",
    "an extragalactic  cloud has recently been discovered in the fornax cluster ( bland - hawthorn  1995 ) .",
    "mathewson , cleary & murray ( 1975 ) and arp ( 1985 ) found tentative evidence for hi clouds within the sculptor group ( cf . haynes & roberts 1979 ) .",
    "it is difficult , however , to reconcile the  radial velocity ( @xmath12440 ) with the magellanic stream which passes in front of the sculptor group ( mathewson & ford 1984 ) .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility that the rotation curve of ngc 253 is indeed falling beyond 10 kpc .",
    "such a rapid decrease suggests that the dark halo may be truncated .",
    "we can illustrate the effect of such truncation with a simple model .",
    "we take the halo density distribution to be @xmath102 with the rotation curve @xmath103 given by @xmath104\\ ] ] for @xmath105  and core radius @xmath106 kpc , the rotation curve for this model is very similar to that of the isothermal halo in fig .",
    "7@xmath61 : the optical galaxy lies well within the core radius of the halo , and the halo rotation curve is close to solid - body .",
    "we now truncate the halo at @xmath107 kpc ; its rotation curve is then keplerian for @xmath108 kpc .",
    "7@xmath51 shows how the resulting total rotation curve now provides an acceptable fit to all of the hi and taurus-2 data .",
    "the model is artificial ( the halo is sharply truncated , and we did not truncate the stellar and hi disks ) , but the point is obvious enough : truncation of the dark halo near the observed outer edge of the hi disk can produce the apparent falling rotation curve",
    ".    if this is all correct so far , there are some interesting consequences .",
    "the properties of dark halos are best studied in disk galaxies for which the hi distribution extends well beyond the optical distribution . in the outer regions of these galaxies ,",
    "the ratio of ( dark matter surface density)/(hi surface density ) is roughly constant ( bosma , 1978 ; carignan 1991 ) .",
    "ngc 253 is not such a galaxy .",
    "its hi extent is similar to its optical extent ( pcvg ) .",
    "our data provides the first hint that , in galaxies like ngc 253 where the hi and the light are co - extensive , the dark matter also may not extend much beyond the optical distribution .",
    "it is tentative evidence of the apparent link between the dark matter and the hi .",
    "we emphasize that the dark matter is still essential to generate the observed rotation curve for ngc 253 : the inferred mass ratio of dark matter to luminous matter is about 5 . our point is simply that the dark matter distribution in ngc 253 may be truncated at a radius of only 10 kpc , compared to the much larger dark halo distributions observed in our galaxy ( freeman 1996 ) and other large spirals ( zaritsky 1997 ) .",
    "the reduced chi square for the models presented in fig . 7@xmath61 and 7@xmath60 are 5.2 and 2.9 respectively .",
    "the latter model has the highest statistical significance of all models , but the basic assumptions are unlikely to be physical . a flat rotation curve given by equation  [ arctan ]",
    "does not fit the measurements adequately .",
    "the reduced chi square is 6.3 and , more significantly , 10 of 12 points outside of @xmath59  miss the curve by more than 2@xmath38 .",
    "but the inclusion of a truncation radius lowers the reduced chi square to 3.9 and the curve now passes through all the outer points ( fig .",
    "7@xmath51 ) .      the most striking feature of the spectra presented in figs .",
    "4 and 5 is the inferred high /  ratios . in order to ensure that the whitelight calibration adequately removed the filter response over the field ( @xmath64 ) , we examined the line ratios in hii regions over the inner disk . where we have two interference rings that fall close together on the sky ",
    "one from , the other from [ nii ]  the hii regions appear weak in [ nii ] compared to , indicative of the order of magnitude difference expected for inner disk hii regions .",
    "if the outer hi gas has sub - solar abundances ( pagel 1989 ; diaz 1989 ) , the enhanced line ratio must arise from one or more excitation processes .",
    "however , to date , numerical models involving a single ionizing source have not managed to produce such an enhancement ( e.g. sokolowski 1994 ) .",
    "thus , we separate our discussion of ionization and excitation wherever possible .",
    "almost certainly , the anomalous ratio is indicative of a higher local electron temperature for which there are various mechanisms . in solar - abundance hii regions , this ratio rarely exceeds 0.15 ( evans & dopita 1985 ) : to substantially increase this ratio",

    "the emission measure   from the surface of a cloud embedded in a bath of ionizing radiation gives a direct gauge , independent of distance , of the intensity of the ambient radiation field beyond the lyman continuum ( lyc ) edge ( hogan & weymann 1987 ) .",
    "this assumes that the covering fraction _ seen by the ionizing photons _ is known and that there are sufficient gas atoms to soak up the incident ionizing photons . at electron temperatures of 10@xmath109k , collisional ionization processes are negligible .",
    "perpendicular to the surface , from equation  [ ion_balance ] , the column recombination rate in equilibrium must equal the incident ionizing photon flux , @xmath110 , where  is the rate at which lyman continuum photons arrive at a planar cloud surface ( phot @xmath4 s@xmath11 ) , and   is the column density of ionized hydrogen .",
    "the emission measure produced by this ionizing flux is @xmath111 where @xmath112 ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 1997 , hereafter bm ) .",

    "the present upper limit on the metagalactic ionizing flux ( @xmath63.1 ) is @xmath122  ( @xmath30 ) which sets an upper limit on the one - sided ionizing flux at the surface of an optically thick hi sheet of @xmath123 , thereby ruling out the metagalactic background as the dominant ionizing source .",
    "the combined ionizing radiation from hot gas and galaxies within the sculptor group is also much too weak .",
    "sciama ( 1995 ) predicts an order of magnitude higher ionizing flux from decaying neutrinos which could conceivably account for much of the  flux .",
    "however , the narrow energy bandpass of decaying neutrinos ( sciama 1996 ) at the lyman limit can not produce , and therefore requires an additional source of ionization .",
    "the most recent summary of the macho project indicates that as much as half of the dark matter in the galaxy out to the lmc is made up of solar mass objects .",
    "there is wide disagreement on whether the missing mass could comprise a halo population of white dwarfs ( adams & laughlin 1996 ; kawaler 1996 ; chabrier , segretain & mera 1996 ) . but",
    "most plausible models invoke a population which produces essentially no uv flux today .",
    "this is supported by high redshift observations of the precursor halo population ( charlot & silk 1995 ) .",
    "unlike ellipticals , spiral galaxy disks tend not to `` grow '' when photographic plates are stacked or amplified to reveal light at very faint levels ( malin 1983 ) . but",
    "a photographically amplified plate of ngc 253 ( malin 1981 ) reveals a faint blue disk extending to the limits of our outermost detection ( @xmath124 ) . following a suggestion from g.b .",
    "field , we now consider whether these could comprise an extended white dwarf population ( including the precursor population of central stars in planetary nebulae ) young enough to produce a significant uv disk flux .",
    "such a population was originally broached by lyon ( 1975 ) and bania & lyon ( 1980 ) . in fig .",
    "8 , we consider whether white dwarfs are able to account for the diffuse line emission in concert with the faint stellar continuum at the hi edge in ngc 253 ( barred arrow ) .",
    "we present the expected  emission measure  versus @xmath50 surface brightness for an isothermal population of white dwarfs as a function of the disk surface density .",
    "the contribution to both of these quantities from white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood is also shown ( filled symbols ) .",
    "the luminosity function is taken from liebert , dahn & monet ( 1988 ) and the luminosity@xmath7temperature conversion from wood ( 1990 ) .",
    "there are two basic problems in using white dwarfs to explain the disk ionization . in the solar neighbourhood",
    ", the combined effect of all white dwarfs could produce  @xmath125  which fails to explain the reynolds layer emission by an order of magnitude or more , in agreement with nordgren , cordes & terzian ( 1992 ) .",
    "if we assume a comparable star formation history in the outer reaches of ngc 253 , this model could conceivably be used to explain the measured   emission .",
    "this is particularly attractive in that the high temperatures of the white dwarf population produce elevated /   ratios ( sokolowski & bland - hawthorn 1991 ) .",
    "however , if the luminosity function resembles the solar neighbourhood , the combined disk surface brightness at @xmath50 from the cooler white dwarfs is very much brighter than observed , particularly when one includes the contribution of early main sequence stars . alternatively , attempting to explain the low  emission measure in terms of 2000 white dwarfs kpc@xmath37 at 45,000 k leads to a timing problem .",
    "we have measured an age - temperature relation from wood ( 1990 ) for which @xmath126 stars hotter than 40,000 k have left the asymptotic giant branch less than 10@xmath127 years ago which would require a highly contrived star formation history throughout the disk .",
    "ryan has suggested the possibility of hot horizontal branch stars , in particular , an isothermal population with temperatures around 15,000 k ( lee 1993 ) . if we assume comparable line blanketing with white dwarfs , fig .",
    "8 illustrates that such a population will always produce too much blue light for the required ionizing flux , irrespective of the uncertain sizes and surface densities of both objects . the characteristic `` temperature '' of the ionizing source needs to be sufficiently high to fall within the strict @xmath50 band limit .",
    "interestingly , this is just what is needed to significantly enhance the /  ratio as photons with higher mean energies produce higher electron temperatures .",
    "_ ram pressure heating . _ mathis ( 1986 ) has stressed the problems associated with shocks as a source of ionization and heating for the reynolds layer , particularly the near - uniformity of the emission .",
    "an interesting possibility is ram pressure heating as ngc 253 moves through an external medium where the disk is inclined at some angle to its direction of motion .",
    "the wake of ngc 7421 ( ryder  1996 ) suggests that such a process can take place . to ionize a column of 10@xmath3 atoms @xmath4 requires shock speeds close to 130   ( dopita & sutherland 1996 ) . a medium with pre - shock density @xmath128 @xmath33 moving through an ambient medium with the relatively high density @xmath129 @xmath33 at 400  could produce the necessary ram pressure .",
    "the post - shock temperature at a shock velocity of 130   is @xmath130 which is a factor of ten higher than the upper limit from the doppler parameter ( 22 ) of the observed line profiles . for  and",
    "to have been collisionally ionized , the gas must have had time to cool . but",
    "groups with low velocity dispersions , like the sculptor group , tend to have very little intracluster medium ( fadda  1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the galaxy would need to be running into a large , external gas cloud for the shock model to remain plausible .",
    "there exists a wide range of ` exotic ' models for preferentially heating the electron population including turbulence - driven mhd wave heating ( raymond 1990 ) , and mixing layers driven by bulk flows ( slavin , shull & begelman 1993 ) .",
    "bulk flows and turbulence in the disk are thought to be maintained primarily by energy injection from star formation .",
    "the star formation rates at the hi edge are likely to be very small .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the outer disk is being rained on by galactic fountain material driven by the inner starburst ( e.g. benjamin & shapiro 1993 ) .",
    "it is unclear at present whether fountain models can generate the necessary heating through shocks .",
    "ferland & mushotsky ( 1984 ) have shown that under rather special conditions , low energy cosmic ray electrons can selectively heat ions and electrons through coulomb repulsion . however , sciama ( 1996 ) emphasizes the difficulties involved in cosmic rays penetrating gas clouds and these do not appear to be an important agent .",
    "the inner disk of ngc 253 hosts a young , stellar population producing copious amounts of ionizing photons .",
    "it is plausible that the outer disk sees this radiation either through dust scattering or through warps in the outer parts . for rayleigh scattering",
    ", we have repeated the calculations of jura ( 1980 ) using up - to - date dielectric phase functions ( martin & rouleau 1990 ; draine & lee 1984 ) and assuming a standard grain mixture and distribution ( mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 ) .",
    "we adopt the henyey - greenstein ( 1941 ) phase function which relates the asymmetry parameter @xmath81 to photon energy .",
    "the expected ionizing flux at the hi edge is much less than 10@xmath131  due primarily to the highly forward - scattering behaviour ( @xmath132 ) of the grains at increasing energy towards the lyman limit .",
    "while there is some uncertainty as to the fraction of ionizing photons which escape a normal spiral galaxy , two independent lines of argument suggest that roughly 5% of ionizing photons escape the galaxy ( domgrgen & mathis 1994 ; bm ) .",
    "the absolute @xmath50 magnitude of ngc 253 is comparable to that inferred for the galaxy and thus , if the disk opacity is comparable in both cases , the same models in bm apply here .",
    "bothun ( personal communication ) suspects that the disk of ngc 253 may be more opaque than the milky way , in which case our predicted fluxes should be considered upper limits .",
    "to explain the  flux at both outer positions ( 9 and 12 kpc ) requires an integral sign warp originating at 7 kpc reaching 20  at 10 kpc .",
    "it is difficult to rule this out on the basis of the hi data . at face value , fig .",
    "8 of pcvg indicates such a warp starts at 7 kpc reaching @xmath1210  at 9 kpc . in the next section ,",
    "we explore this model in more detail .",
    "after sokolowski ( 1994 ) , we attempt to simulate conditions at the hi edges of spiral galaxies ionized by the stellar radiation field from the central disk .",
    "this requires that the outer sw edge of ngc 253 is warped ( @xmath133 ) or flares up and therefore sees the central regions .",
    "we use the cloudy code ( ferland 1991 ) to ionize plane parallel slabs with cosmic abundances ( grevesse & anders 1989 ) . the physical state and emission spectrum of a low - density photoionized gas with a given composition",
    "are fixed by two parameters @xmath7 the shape of the ionizing continuum and the ionization parameter ( tarter , tucker & salpeter 1969 ) . for the ionization parameter , @xmath134 ( the ratio of ionizing photons to nucleons )",
    ", we adopt @xmath135 where @xmath51 is the speed of light . in fig .",
    "10 , the results for a range of emission - line diagnostics are presented as a function @xmath134 .",
    "the radiation - bounded models are truncated when the electron temperature @xmath136 falls below 4000k ; all models assume @xmath53 1 @xmath33 .",
    "the unabsorbed radiation field is a composite taking the form @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the current star formation rate , @xmath139 is the initial mass function , and @xmath140 is the main - sequence lifetime .",
    "the ionizing field is dominated by stars with @xmath141 ; we specify the upper mass cut - off to be @xmath142 .",
    "the stellar atmospheres are from mihalas ( 1972 ) and kurucz ( 1979 ) ; the solar metallicity evolutionary tracks are from maeder ( 1990 ) . for the massive star imf , we adopt @xmath143 which falls between the salpeter ( 1955 ) and the miller - scalo ( 1979 ) models .",
    "irrespective of the _ shape _ of the ionizing continuum , a dilute radiation field leads to enhanced emission from low ionization emission lines ( ferland & netzer 1983 ; halpern & steiner 1983 ) .",
    "but a general hardening of the ionizing field also produces the same trend ( e.g. sokolowski & bland - hawthorn 1991 ) .",
    "indeed , if the edges of spirals are ionized by the central stellar disk , the ionizing field is expected to be both dilute and hardened .",
    "there are at least two phenomena which serve to harden the local ionizing radiation field : interstellar opacity and metal depletion ( i.e. refractory elements ) onto grains .",
    "we assume that the ionizing photons have leaked from the young inner disk and that the ionizing spectrum has been hardened by intervening absorption ( @xmath144 perpendicular to the disk ) .",
    "we adopt the atomic photoionization cross - section for which the average interstellar opacity varies as @xmath145 above 13.6ev ( cruddace  1974 ) . in quiescent galaxies ,",
    "the outer hi disk is expected to have sub - solar metallicities (   molla  1996 ) .",
    "but the ongoing nuclear starburst in ngc 253 ( beck & beckwith 1984 ; antonucci & ulvestad 1988 ) could conceivably enrich the outer disk through long - range galactic fountains ( corbelli & salpeter 1988 ) . on balance ,",
    "we adopt solar abundances ( grevesse & anders 1989 ) modified by the known depletion rates for cold gas ( cowie & songaila 1986 ; jenkins 1987 ; savage & massa 1987 ) .",
    "the formation of grains depletes primarily ca , fe and si which in turn suppresses the dominant coolants from the singly - ionized stages of these atoms ( ferland 1992 ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath146 , 158@xmath8 m and 35@xmath8 m account for one quarter of the total nebular cooling .",
    "while c , n and o are not strongly depleted , the forbidden line emission from , ,  and  is greatly enhanced by the increased temperature .",
    "in particular , mathis ( 1986 ) finds that the /  ratio increases as @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , a 20% increase in the local electron temperature can effectively double this line ratio .",
    "we neglect grain heating and cooling processes ( reynolds & cox 1992 ) as these are only important in the high @xmath134 limit ( baldwin  1991 ; ferland 1992 ) .",
    "complete removal of the grain population from the depleted gas causes line strengths to change by no more than 5% ( shields 1992 ) .",

    "the high energy photons are essential : cutting off the continuum just below the ionization potential of nii ( 29.6 ev ) produces /  line ratios no higher than 0.25 .",

    "the dilute radiation field with interstellar absorption can produce line ratios closer to unity ( e.g. sokolowski 1991 ) .",
    "an additional 50% increase is achieved with the known gas phase depletions of refractory elements .",
    "further enhancement of this ratio ( for a fixed abundance ) requires that we selectively heat the electrons without producing a higher ionization state of nitrogen .",

    "the detected emission measures of the  and  lines are sufficiently strong that it is unlikely the source of the ionization is the metagalactic uv background .",
    "the strength of the  line with respect to the   line argues for an enhanced electron temperature at large galactic radius compared with the inner hii regions .",
    "the dominant ionization mechanism is suspected to be due to hot young stars in the inner regions which see the warped outer hi disk .",
    "we present a composite ionization model which may have some application to the hi edges of ngc 253 , but a full explanation requires additional heat sources .",
    "the kinematic measurements confirm that the rotation curve is still rising at and beyond the hi edge . in some respects , since the hi disk ceases to be detectable at only 1.2 , this is not an ideal object for testing the original proposal of bochkarev & sunyaev ( 1977 ) .",
