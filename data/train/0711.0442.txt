    "one can study the behaviour near blow - up . for the relation of singular pde problems to the renormalisation group , developed in the context of critical phenomena , see @xcite , for a more computational perspective , see @xcite .",
    "solutions to the original pde ( [ ge ] ) for given initial data can be viewed as orbits in some infinite dimensional phase phase , for instance , @xmath16 .",
    "if the fixed point is an attractor , blow - up will be self - similar for some class of initial initial conditions . however , other types of attractors ( @xmath17-limit sets in the notation which is customary in the context of partial differential equations , see @xcite and references therein ) are frequently observed , furnishing a very fruitful means of _ classifying _ singularities . in this paper",
    "we discuss the following cases :    1 .",
    "_ stable fixed points _ + initial conditions in some neighbourhood of the fixed point become attracted to it , so the solution converges exponentially to the self - similar solution ( [ ss ] ) .",
    "formally , two eigenvalues of the linearisation around the fixed point are always positive , but these unstable motions can be absorbed into a redefinition of the origin of space and time ; this is discussed in section [ sub : first ] . a sub - classification into self - similarity of the first and of the second kind is due to barenblatt @xcite .",
    "self - similar solutions are of the first kind if ( [ ss ] ) only solves ( [ ge ] ) for one set of exponents @xmath9 ; their values are fixed by either dimensional analysis or symmetry , and are thus rational .",
    "solutions are of the second kind ( in the sense of barenblatt ) if solutions ( [ ss ] ) exist for a continuous set of exponents @xmath9 ; the exponents are fixed by a non - linear eigenvalue problem , and take irrational values in general .",
    "2 .   _ unstable fixed points _ + the linearisation around the fixed point possesses positive eigenvalues , so it is never reached , except for non - generic initial data . often a stable fixed point is associated with an infinite sequence of unstable fixed points .",

    "_ strange attractors _ + in principle , more complex behaviour is possible , where the orbits of the dynamical system lie on a strange attractor .",
    "at the moment , we are not aware of an equation exhibiting such behaviour which would correspond to any physical phenomenon",
    ". however , this may simply be due to the fact that the corresponding singular behaviour is more difficult to detect numerically , and to grasp analytically . to demonstrate that such behaviour is at least possible ,",
    "we show that _ any _ finite dimensional dynamical system may be `` embedded '' in the singular dynamics . as an explicit example",
    ", we show that the phase - space trajectory may lie on the lorenz attractor . 7 .   _ exotic objects _",
    "+ there might be other types of behaviour that have no analogue in finite - dimensional dynamical systems .",
    "in particular , blow - up may occur at several points @xmath25 at the same time , in which case the description ( [ ds ] ) is not so useful .    this paper s aim is to assemble the body of knowledge on singularities of equations of the type ( [ ge ] ) that is available in both the mathematical and the applied community , and to categorise it according to the types given above .",
    "in addition to rigorous results we pay particular attention to various phenomenological aspects of singularities which are often crucial for their appearance in an experiment or a numerical simulation .",
    "for example , what are the implications of the type of singularity for the approach of the pde solution onto the self - similar form ( [ ss ] ) ? in most cases , we rely on known examples from the mathematical physics literature . to find an explicit example for limit cycle behaviour as well as chaotic dynamics , we propose a new set of model equations , inspired by a problem in general relativity .",

    "an experimental photograph of this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ lava ] . to further simplify the problem",
    ", we make the assumption ( the full problem is completely analogous ) that the fluid thread is slender .",
    "then the equations given in @xcite simplify to @xmath51 where @xmath52 here we have written the velocity in units of the capillary speed @xmath53 .",
    "the limits of integration @xmath54 and @xmath55 are for example the positions of the plates which hold a liquid bridge @xcite .",
    "dimensionally , one would once more expect a local solution of the form @xmath56 and @xmath57 has to be a linear function at infinity to match to a time - independent outer solution . in similarity variables , has the form @xmath58 we have chosen @xmath59 as a real - space variable close to the pinch - point , such that the similarity description is valid in @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "but if @xmath61 is linear , the integral in ( [ 58 ] ) diverges , which means that a simple `` fixed point '' solution ( [ 56 ] ) is impossible .",
    "however , the integral can be made convergent by introducing a shift in the similarity variable @xmath41 : @xmath62 with @xmath10 as usual .",
    "this means in similarity variables the solution is a travelling wave . with this modification , the mass balance ( [ interface ] ) becomes @xmath63 now we choose @xmath64 such that the logarithmic singularity cancels , namely we demand that @xmath65 finite for @xmath66 .",

    "in section [ fixed ] we described the generic situation that the behaviour of a similarity solution is determined by the linearisation around it . in the case of a stable fixed point , convergence is fast , and the observed behaviour is essentially that of the fixed point . in this section ,",
    "we describe two different cases where the largest eigenvalue vanishes , so higher - order non - linear terms have to be taken into account .",
    "the approach to the fixed point is now much slower , and much more of the observed behaviour is determined by the approach to the fixed point .",
    "depending on the type of non - linearity , there is great freedom of possible behaviours , of which we discuss two .",

    "a very good physical realization of ( [ mc ] ) is the melting and freezing of a @xmath74he crystal , driven by surface tension @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . as before ,",
    "the time scale @xmath75 has been chosen such that the diffusion constant , which sets the rate of motion , is normalised to one .",
    "a possible boundary condition for the problem is that @xmath76 , where @xmath30 is some prescribed radius . for certain initial conditions",
    "@xmath77 the interface will become singular at some time @xmath78 , at which @xmath79 and the curvature blows up .",

    "the recording takes a few minutes , the temperature is 0.32 k. 11 mk .",
    "the crystal first `` drips '' down , so that a crystalline `` drop '' forms at the bottom ( a to c ) ; then a second drop appears ( d ) and comes into contact with the first one ( e ) ; coalescence is observed ( f ) and subsequently breakup occurs ( h ) . ]    inserting the self - similar solution ( [ ss ] ) into ( [ mc ] ) , one finds a balance for @xmath80 .",

    "another potential solution is one that grows linearly at infinity , to ensure matching onto a time - independent outer solution .",
    "however , it can be shown that no solution to ( [ mean_sim ] ) , which also grows linearly at infinity , exists @xcite .",
    "our analysis below follows the rigorous work in @xcite , demonstrating type - ii self - similarity .",
    "in addition , we now show how the description of the dynamical system can be carried out to arbitrary order .",
    "the solution relevant to our analysis is the constant solution , but which of course does not match onto a time - independent outer solution .",
    "we thus write the solution as @xmath83 , \\label{blmc}\\ ] ] with @xmath84 as usual .",
    "the equation for @xmath85 is then @xmath86 which we solve by expanding into eigenfunctions of the linear part of the operator @xmath87    it is easily confirmed that @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the n - th hermite polynomial @xcite : @xmath90 thus the linear part of ( [ gequ ] ) becomes @xmath91 which means that all eigenvalues are negative except for the first , which vanishes . to investigate the approach of the cylindrical solution",
    ", one must therefore include nonlinear terms in the equation for @xmath92 .",
    "if we write @xmath93 the equation for @xmath92 becomes @xmath94 whose solution is @xmath95    thus instead of the expected exponential convergence onto the fixed point , the approach is only algebraic . since all other eigenvalues are negative , the @xmath14-dependence of the @xmath96 is effectively determined by @xmath92 .",
    "namely , as we will see below , @xmath97 , so corrections to ( [ a1 ] ) are of higher order .",
    "if one linearises around ( [ a1_r ] ) , putting @xmath98 , one finds @xmath99 this means that the coefficient @xmath100 of @xmath101 remains undetermined , and a simple expansion of @xmath96 in powers of @xmath102 yields an indeterminate system . instead , at quadratic order ,",
    "a term of the form @xmath103 is needed .",
    "fortunately , this is the only place in the system of nonlinear equations for @xmath96 where such an indeterminacy occurs .",
    "thus all logarithmic dependencies can be traced , leading to the general ansatz @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are coefficients to be determined .",
    "the index @xmath49 is the order of the truncation .",
    "indeed , the coefficients can be found recursively by considering terms of successively higher order in @xmath102 in the first equation : @xmath107 the next two orders will involve the next coefficient @xmath108 . from ( [ ai_sys1 ] ) and ( [ ai_sys2 ] ) ,",
    "one first finds @xmath109 and @xmath110 , by considering @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively . then , at order @xmath113 in the first equation , where @xmath114 , one finds all remaining coefficients @xmath106 in the expansion ( [ ai_gen ] ) up to @xmath115 . at each order in @xmath102 , there is of course a series expansion in @xmath116 which determines all the coefficients .",

    "two remarks are in order .",
    "first , the presence of logarithms implies that there is some dependence on initial conditions built into the description .",
    "the reason is that the argument inside the logarithm needs to be non - dimensionalised using some `` external '' time scale .",
    "more formally , any change in time scale @xmath123 leads to an identical equation if also lengths are rescaled according to @xmath124 .",
    "this leaves the prefactor in ( [ hmin_res ] ) invariant , but adds an arbitrary constant @xmath125 to @xmath14 .",
    "this is illustrated by comparing to a numerical simulation of the mean curvature equation ( [ mc ] ) close to the point of breakup , see fig .",
    "[ hminfig ] .",
    "namely , we subtract the analytical result ( [ hmin_res ] ) from the numerical solution @xmath126 and multiply by @xmath127 . as seen in fig.[hminfig ] , the remainder is varying slowly over 12 decades in @xmath128 .",
    "if the constant @xmath125 is adjusted , this small variation is seen to be consistent with the logarithmic dependence predicted by ( [ hmin_res ] ) .",
    "the second important point is that convergence in space is no longer uniform as implied by ( [ conv1 ] ) for the case of self - similarity of the first kind .",
    "namely , to leading order the pinching solution is a cylinder . for this to be a good approximation",
    ", one has to require that the correction is small : @xmath129 .",
    "thus corrections become important beyond @xmath130 , which , in view of the logarithmic growth of @xmath14 , implies convergence in a constant region _ in similarity variables only_. as shown in @xcite , the slow convergence toward the self - similar behaviour has important consequences for a comparison to experimental data .",
    "the next example is that of bubble breakup @xcite , for which a very different form of nonlinearity is observed .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the equation for a slender cavity or bubble is @xmath131 where @xmath132 .",
    "the integral runs over the fluid domain .",
    "if for the moment one disregards boundary conditions looks for solutions to ( [ bernoulli ] ) of cylindrical form , @xmath133 , one can do the integral to find @xmath134 it is easy to show that an an asymptotic solution of ( [ cyl ] ) is given by @xmath135 corresponding to a power law with a small logarithmic correction .",
    "indeed , initial theories of bubble pinch - off @xcite treated the case of an approximately cylindrical cavity , which leads to the radial exponent @xmath136 , with logarithmic corrections .",
    ", width=302 ]    however both experiment @xcite and simulation @xcite show that the cylindrical solution is unstable ; rather , the pinch region is rather localised , see fig .",
    "[ shape ] .",
    "therefore , it is not enough to treat the width of the cavity as a constant @xmath137 ; the width @xmath138 is itself a time - dependent quantity . in @xcite",
    "we show that to leading order the time evolution of the integral equation ( [ bernoulli ] ) can be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations for the minimum @xmath139 of @xmath140 , as well as its curvature @xmath141 .     between full numerical simulations of bubble pinch - off ( solid line ) and the leading order asymptotic theory ( dashed line ) .",
    "[ compare ] , width=264 ]    namely , the integral in ( [ bernoulli ] ) is dominated by a local contribution from the pinch region . to estimate this contribution , it is sufficient to expand the profile around the minimum at @xmath142 : @xmath143 . as in previous theories ,",
    "the integral depends logarithmically on @xmath144 , but the axial length scale is provided by the inverse curvature @xmath145 . thus evaluating ( [ bernoulli ] ) at the minimum , one obtains @xcite to leading order @xmath146 which is a coupled equation for @xmath139 and @xmath138 .",
    "thus , a second equation is needed to close the system , which is obtained by evaluating the the second derivative of ( [ bernoulli ] ) at the pinch point : @xmath147    the two coupled equations ( [ a0]),([deltaequ ] ) are most easily recast in terms of the time - dependent exponents @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 , are a generalisation of the usual exponents @xmath151 and @xmath152 . the exponent @xmath153 characterises the time dependence of the aspect ratio @xmath138 . returning to the collapse ( [ cyl ] ) predicted for a constant solution , one finds that @xmath154 and @xmath155 . in the spirit of the the previous subsection",
    ", this is the fixed point corresponding to the cylindrical solution .",
    "now we expand the values of @xmath151 and @xmath153 around their expected asymptotic values @xmath156 and @xmath157 : @xmath158    to leading order in @xmath153 , the resulting equations are @xmath159 which describe perturbations around the leading - order similarity solution .",
    "these equations are analogous to , but they have a degeneracy of third order , rather than second order .",
    "equations are easily solved to yield , in an expansion for small @xmath153 @xcite , @xmath160 thus the exponents converge toward their asymptotic values @xmath161 only very slowly , as illustrated in fig .  [ compare ] .",
    "this explains why typical experimental values are found in the range @xmath162 @xcite , and why there is a weak dependence on initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the cubic equation ( [ exp_ad ] ) applies to the exponents @xmath151,@xmath153 , rather than the solution itself , as in the previous subsection , where we dealt with mean curvature flow .",
    "in fact , it is easy to re - analyse the solution to the mean curvature problem , and to formulate it in terms of time - dependent exponents .",
    "let us define @xmath139 and @xmath141 for the mean curvature problem through @xmath163 . from ( [ blmc ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "this gives @xmath166 , and thus @xmath167 instead of ( [ deg_ad ] ) .",
    "this means mean curvature flow , formulated in terms of exponents , once more gives a quadratic non - linearity , rather than the cubic term ( [ deg_ad ] ) found for bubble collapse . from ( [ deg_mc ] )",
    "one finds to leading order @xmath168 and @xmath169 for the mean curvature flow .",
    "an example for this kind of blow - up was introduced into the literature in @xcite in the context of cosmology .",
    "there is considerable numerical evidence @xcite that discrete self - similarity occurs at the mass threshold for the formation of a black hole .",
    "the same type of self - similarity has also been proposed for singularities of the euler equation @xcite and for a variety of other phenomena @xcite .",

    "such high - dimensional systems in principle allow for a rich variety of dynamical behaviours , including those found in classical finite dimensional dynamical systems , such as chaos .",
    "consider for instance an equation for the perturbation @xmath85 ( the analogue of ( [ gequ ] ) ) of the form @xmath200 where @xmath201 is a linear operator .",
    "assuming an appropriate non - linear structure for the function @xmath202 , an arbitrary nonlinear ( chaotic ) dynamics can be added .    to give an explicit example of a system of pdes exhibiting chaotic dynamics , consider the structure of the example given in the previous section [ limit ] .",
    "it can be generalised to produce _ any _ low - dimensional dynamics near the singularity .",
    "namely , let us generalise the system ( [ f : a])-([f : c ] ) to    @xmath203    using the transformation ( [ char1 ] ) , the first @xmath49 equations are turned into : @xmath204 which is an ode system for constant @xmath174 .",
    "the system ( [ sys1 ] ) has to be solved with initial conditions @xmath205    as before , the function @xmath183 can be eliminated using ( [ v_trans ] ) , resulting in the general non - linear dynamical system @xmath206 now if one chooses @xmath207 and @xmath208 ( [ sys2 ] ) is the lorenz system @xcite .",
    "as before , for @xmath196 , the variable @xmath194 goes to infinity , and near the singularity one is exploring the long - time behaviour of the dynamical system ( [ sys2 ] ) . in the case of ( [ sys_l ] ) , and for sufficiently large @xmath209 , the resulting dynamics will be chaotic . specifically ,",
    "taking @xmath210 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 , as done by lorenz @xcite , the maximal lyapunov exponent is @xmath213 . now",
    "if @xmath214 is a solution of ( [ sys2 ] ) with initial conditions ( [ sys_init ] ) , the final form of the similarity solution is @xmath215 in the limit @xmath196 one can not replace the first argument by @xmath216 .",
    "the reason is that in the limit of large @xmath14 two trajectories diverge like @xmath217 , where the largest lyapunov exponent is larger than @xmath156 .",
    "the singularities described in this paper are point - like in the sense that they occur at a single point @xmath218 at a given time @xmath219 .",
    "there are two important situations we have not discussed and for which the dynamical systems point of view and analytical approach does not apply .",
    "first , the case of singularities not developing at single points , but on sets of finite measure .",
    "this is the case in a few simple examples of reaction - diffusion equations of the family @xmath220 where depending on values of @xmath221 and @xmath222 singularities in the form of blowing - up @xmath223 may be regional ( @xmath223 blows up in subsets of @xmath224 of finite measure ) or even global ( the solution blows - up in the whole domain ) .",
    "see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "another interesting possibility is that the stable fixed point which is approached depends on the initial conditions .",
    "thus exponents could vary either discretely or continuously with the choice of initial conditions .",
    "the infinite sequence of similarity solutions found for ( [ visc ] ) is _ not _ an example for such behaviour , since only one solution is stable .",
    "all other fixed points will not be visible in practise .",
    "singularities may even happen in sets of fractional hausdorff dimension , i.e. , fractals .",
    "this is the case of the inviscid one - dimensional system for jet breakup ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and might be case of navier - stokes system in three dimensions , where the dimension of the singular set at the time of first blow - up is at most @xmath225 ( cf .",
    "this connects with the second issue we did not address here .",
    "it is the nature of the singular sets both in space and time .  in many instances ,",
    "existence of global in time ( for all @xmath226 ) solutions to nonlinear problems can be established in a _ weak sense _ , that is , allowing certain kind of singularities to develop both in space and time . in the case of 3-d navier - stokes system ,",
    "the impossibility of singularities `` moving '' in time , that is of curves @xmath227 @xmath228 in the singular set is well - known @xcite .",
    "hence , provided a certain singularity does not persist in time , the question is how to continue the solutions after a singularity has developed .",
    "this paper is an outgrowth of discussions between the authors and r. deegan , preparing a workshop on singularities at the isaac newton institute , cambridge .",
