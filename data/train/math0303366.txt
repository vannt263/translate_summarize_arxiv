    "a packing of unit spheres in @xmath2 is _ @xmath3-saturated _ if it is not possible to replace @xmath4 spheres by @xmath3 and still have a packing ; it is _ completely saturated _ if it is @xmath3-saturated for all @xmath3 @xcite . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "every completely saturated packing has maximum density , and every periodic packing with maximum density is completely saturated .",
    "thus the densest lattice packing of circles in @xmath0 ( the _ honeycomb _ circle packing ) is completely saturated .",
    "this motivates the question : is the honeycomb circle packing the only one which is completely saturated ?",
    "g.  fejes tth , g.  kuperberg , and w.  kuperberg @xcite asked whether a honeycomb circle packing with a linear shift defect , as in figure  [ shift ] , is completely saturated .",
    "this question appears to be closely related to the ( still open ) conjecture of l.  fejes tth @xcite asserting that the same packing is _ solid _ , meaning that if you obtain another packing by rearranging finitely many circles , it is congruent to the original one .    in this paper",
    "we will instead consider packings with a linear or planar gap defect in which the spheres on either side do not touch .",
    "[ n - gap ] let @xmath5 be a sphere packing in @xmath2 let @xmath6 be a hyperplane , let @xmath7 be a closed half - space bounded by @xmath8 , and let @xmath9 be a vector perpendicular to @xmath8 in the direction of @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath10 be the packing obtained from @xmath5 by moving all spheres with centers in @xmath7 by the vector @xmath9 .",
    "( note that @xmath10 is a packing because the motion does not decrease the distances between sphere centers . )",
    "then @xmath10 is a _ sphere packing with a hyperplane gap defect _ and @xmath11 is the _ width _ of the gap .",
    "figure  [ gapa ] shows a honeycomb circle packing with a linear gap defect .",
    "a honeycomb circle packing in @xmath0 with a linear gap defect is not completely saturated , regardless of the width and direction of the gap .",
    "an fcc ( face - centered cubic lattice ) packing of spheres in @xmath1 with an arbitrary planar gap defect is also not completely saturated .",
    "since the honeycomb circle packing in @xmath0 @xcite and the fcc sphere packing in @xmath1 @xcite are the unique densest lattice sphere packings in 2 and 3 dimensions , we obtain the following corollary .    in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , no lattice sphere packing with a hyperplane gap defect is completely saturated .",
    "let @xmath12 be the honeycomb circle packing in @xmath0 with a circle center at every point of the form @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 and move all circles with center on or above the @xmath16-axis by the vector @xmath17 to obtain the packing @xmath18 .",
    "we will show that @xmath18 is not completely saturated .",
    "it suffices to rearrange finitely many circles in @xmath18 to create a void with enough space for an extra circle . to achieve that",
    ", we will widen the gap by a factor bounded away from @xmath19 in a sufficiently large finite region . if we can create a gap of width @xmath20 , with @xmath21 a non - decreasing function of @xmath22 , then by repeating the operation we can create a gap of any width .",
    "in particular , if the width is at least 2 , there is room for another circle .",
    "we define a _ triangular block of size @xmath23 _ to be a set of @xmath24 circles whose centers lie in an equilateral triangle of edge length @xmath25 , _ i.e. _ , with @xmath23 circles along each edge .",
    "note that a triangular block in @xmath18 must lie entirely on one side of the gap .",
    "if the block points up , we will call it a @xmath26-block ; otherwise we will call it a @xmath27-block . the rearrangement to widen",
    "the gap is as follows : take two @xmath26-blocks , two @xmath27-blocks , and one @xmath28-block that form a trapezoid , as in figure  [ blocks ] .",
    "move the two outer @xmath26-blocks down by a distance of @xmath29 , then move the two @xmath27-blocks at @xmath30 degree angles from vertical by @xmath31 , then move the middle @xmath26-block up by @xmath32 , as in figure  [ move ] . if we choose the distances",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 to maximize @xmath32 , then @xmath32 is at least weakly monotonic in @xmath22 , because increasing @xmath22 relaxes the constraints on the other parameters .",
    "thus the gap is widened by @xmath21 monotonic in @xmath22 , as desired .",
    "since the parameter @xmath23 is arbitrary , it can be taken large enough to repeat the operation with smaller blocks to reach any desired width .",
    "let @xmath12 be the above honeycomb circle packing and let @xmath34 be any line , and now let @xmath18 be the packing @xmath12 with a gap along @xmath34 .",
    "our plan in this case is to create another ( finite ) gap parallel to a lattice line of @xmath12 and reduce to the case of section  [ latgap ] .",
    "the gap can be made any length without sacrificing width .",
    "for each @xmath35 , we can choose a triangular block @xmath36 in @xmath12 of length @xmath23 so that @xmath34 intersects the triangle formed by its circle centers , moreover so that @xmath34 does not meet the vertices .",
    "then @xmath34 divides @xmath36 into two sub - blocks @xmath37 and @xmath38 , one of which , say @xmath37 , has only one corner of @xmath36 . in @xmath18 ,",
    "these two sub - blocks are separated by the gap , as in figure  [ split ] . in @xmath18 ,",
    "then , @xmath37 can be moved towards @xmath38 to introduce gaps on its other two sides .",
    "the length @xmath23 is arbitrary and the width of the new gaps does not depend on @xmath23 .",
    "this completes the reduction .",
    "the fcc sphere packing in @xmath1 decomposes into honeycomb layers , and , as noted by kepler @xcite , it also decomposes into square - lattice layers .",
    "we prove below that the fcc - lattice sphere packing with a gap defect is never completely saturated , no matter how narrow the gap is and no matter along which plane the gap is formed . as before , we first establish special cases .",
    "let @xmath39 be the fcc packing in @xmath1 whose sphere centers are at @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the packing @xmath39 with sphere centers in the upper half - space moved by @xmath43 for some @xmath44 . in this model the square - lattice layers are parallel to coordinate planes of @xmath1 , so @xmath42 has a square - layer gap .    to show that @xmath42 is not completely saturated",
    ", we will delete finitely many spheres , then rearrange finitely many others to create a void large enough to accommodate more spheres than the ones deleted .",
    "we define a _",
    "square pyramid block of size @xmath23 _ to be a collection of @xmath45 spheres in @xmath42 whose sphere centers lie in a square pyramid of edge length @xmath25 , _ i.e. _ , with @xmath23 spheres along each of its edges .",
    "we define a _ simplex block of size @xmath23 _ to be a collection of @xmath46 spheres in @xmath42 whose spheres centers lie in a regular simplex of edge length @xmath25 .",
    "both kinds of blocks have @xmath23 spheres along each edge ; see figure  [ clusters ] for examples .        by analogy with section  [ latgap",
    "] , we will widen the gap by moving 5 square pyramid blocks and 4 simplex blocks forming a cross gable roof , as in figure  [ config ] .",
    "the bases of the square pyramid blocks lie on the gap .",
    "we move the four outer square pyramid blocks down , then move the simplex blocks down and out , then move the middle square pyramid up after removing its top sphere . as before , we choose the motions in order to maximize the size of the last motion ; in this arrangement the last motion is weakly monotonic in @xmath22 .",
    "thus the gap widens by @xmath21 with @xmath21 weakly monotonic in @xmath22 . as before , @xmath21 does not depend on @xmath23 .    as in section  [ latgap ]",
    ", @xmath23 can be large enough to iterate the procedure many times .",
    "let @xmath3 be the number of iterations needed to widen the gap to 2 ; @xmath3 only depends on @xmath22 .",
    "one sphere is deleted in each iteration , for a total of @xmath3 spheres removed .",
    "since the void at the end grows with @xmath23 , we can choose @xmath23 large enough to accommodate these @xmath3 spheres and then some .",
    "our strategy in this case is to expose a square - layer gap in a large finite region by moving a large block that abuts the honeycomb gap .",
    "this reduces the problem to the case considered in section  [ squaregap ] .",
    "the shape of the block is a cuboctahedron sawed in half to expose a regular hexagon face , as in figure  [ hex ] .",
    "as the figure indicates , the three square faces lie in square - lattice directions . moving the block",
    "creates gaps along these faces .",
    "assume now that the plane of the gap does not belong to any of the four parallel classes of the honeycomb layers .",
    "in a manner similar to that of section [ linegap ] , we construct a large tetrahedron block which is cut by the gap into two sub - blocks @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "if the plane is not parallel to a square - lattice layer , then we can arrange that @xmath37 contains 1 vertex of the tetrahedron and @xmath38 contains 3 vertices .",
    "the sub - block @xmath37 can then be moved towards the opposite face , which creates a honeycomb - layer gap and reduces the problem to that of section [ squaregap ] .",
    "1 .   is there a completely saturated sphere packing with a gap defect in @xmath2 ( @xmath47 ) ? 2 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the densest lattice packing of spheres in @xmath48 , which is composed of fcc layers .",
    "let @xmath8 be a hyperplane in an fcc direction and let @xmath49 be a sphere packing obtained from @xmath5 by introducing a gap defect along @xmath8 .",
    "we conjecture that @xmath49 is not completely saturated .",
    "3 .   let @xmath50 be a tiling of @xmath0 with regular hexagons , and let @xmath51 be a packing obtained from @xmath50 by introducing a gap . if the gap is sufficiently narrow , is @xmath51 completely saturated ?",
