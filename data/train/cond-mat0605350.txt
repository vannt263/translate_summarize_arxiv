    "separating the bcs and bec extremes is the so - called unitarity point @xmath8 .",
    "it is worth noting that the unitarity regime is approximately realized in the inner crust of the neutron stars , where the neutron - neutron scattering length is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the mean interparticle separation @xcite .",
    "the fermi gas at unitarity is a peculiar case of a strongly interacting system with no interaction - related energy scale : the divergent scattering length and any related energy scale drop out completely .",
