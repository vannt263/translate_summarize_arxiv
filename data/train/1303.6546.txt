    "overcharging is a surprising phenomenon in which conterions adsorbed to a surface exceed the number of fixed surface charges  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", coions are drawn from the bulk toward the overcharged surface leading to a formation of a `` triple - layer '' .",
    "because the underlying mechanism of overcharging relies on electrostatic correlations  @xcite , it has become synonymous with the strong - coupling limit .",
    "indeed , a mean - field treatment which accurately captures the weak - coupling limit , can not describe overcharging .",
    "( however , the mean - field in combination with the excluded volume interactions can induce overcharging if the bulk volume fraction of an electrolyte is sufficiently large to generate a depletion force that pushes particles against a surface .",
    "this effect is seen in uncharged systems and persists for weakly charged surface charges @xcite . )    in the strong - coupling limit overcharging is the result of increased structuring within the layer of counterions .",
    "the electrostatic correlations between the condensed counterions lead to formation of correlation `` holes '' within the layer of condensed ions which can attract excess of counterions from the bulk .",
    "the value of the coupling constant @xmath0 , which is the ratio between the bjerrum and gouy - chapman length ( @xmath1 is the valency ) , estimates the extent of correlation effects . in the limit @xmath2 , the counterions are said to freeze into a 2d wigner crystal @xcite . at large , but finite @xmath3 , the local structure of an ionic fluid remains wigner - like @xcite .",
    "the above mechanism is specific to coulomb interactions that diverge as @xmath4 and , therefore , exhibit the excluded volume effects @xcite . if , however , the divergence in the pair interaction is removed ( the pair potential is bounded as @xmath4 ) , particles can interpenetrate and the usual excluded volume interactions underlying the crystal formation are eliminated ( at sufficiently high temperature and/or density ) .",
    "for some family of bounded potentials , particles can form stacks where two or more particles occupy the same position and act as an effective single particle .",
    "this is possible only if a pair potential is sufficiently flat around @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "one example is the penetrable sphere model where the pair potential is the step function @xcite .",
    "the stacking formations stabilize the liquid phase @xcite , since doublets , triplets , etc . effectively decrease the number of particles .",
    "the presence of stacked formations is signaled as a positive peak in the pair correlation function at @xmath4 @xcite . extrapolating these ideas to ions , which in addition to penetrable cores have long - range coulomb interactions , we ask what influence penetrability has on the structure of a double - layer .",
    "can the restructuring invoked by the penetrability lead to overcharging in the weak - coupling limit ?    in the present work , the divergence in the coulomb potential is removed by smearing - out the central charge of an ion over a finite region .",
    "the penetrating core , then , depends on the weight function used to smear out the charge .",
    "this procedure does not require going beyond the framework of electrostatics and the weak - coupling limit can be described by the modified version of the poisson - boltzmann equation .",
    "bulk properties and phase diagram of penetrable ions have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the main feature is the formation of the bjerrum pairs of two opposite ions that function as polarizable particles .",
