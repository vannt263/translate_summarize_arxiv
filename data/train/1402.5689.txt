    "debates over the status of the _ quantum state _ concept have been ongoing since the beginning of the theory .",
    "is the state @xmath0 a _ physically real _ object ( ontic interpretation ) , or is it an abstract entity that merely provides _ information _ about the system ( epistemic interpretation ) ?",
    "the introduction of _ ontological models _ by harrigan and spekkens @xcite created a framework whereby the discussion could be made much more precise .",
    "now the arguments are based on mathematically proven theorems , in addition to philosophical arguments .",
    "but the growing number of theorems , combined with some peculiar terminology , has led to confusion .",
    "we read of _ maximally @xmath0-epistemic _ models @xcite@xcite , and _ maximally nontrivial @xmath0-epistemic _ models @xcite .",
    "the two terms are not synonymous ; moreover , the authors of the first prove the nonexistence of that class of models , whereas the authors of the second provide constructive examples of their class .",
    "several other classes of ontological models have been discussed , many of which have constructive ( though often artificial ) examples . if this was not already complicated enough , it has been claimed to prove @xcite that the only _ mathematically _ consistent interpretation is that _ the wave function of a system be in one - to - one correspondence with its elements of reality_. yet the observational inadequacy of that interpretation was already well known to einstein and schrdinger in 1935 , since in that interpretation , schrdinger s cat would have neither the property of being live nor being dead .",
    "taken together , all of these claims seem to indicate that no satisfactory interpretation of quantum theory is even possible !",
    "`` a good joke should not be repeated too often , '' as einstein said to heisenberg . in this paper",
    "i shall try to overcome the confusion that may come from a casual reading of the recent literature , with its apparently conflicting claims .",
    "i shall limit myself to ontological models of _ single component _ systems , and",
    "so will not treat bell s theorem , nonlocality , or entanglement .",
    "those topics have their own extensive literature , and including them would make for much too long a paper .",
    "in an ontological model , we posit a space @xmath2 of _ ontic states _ , which underlie or supplement the quantum state @xmath0 .",
    "the two primary quantum - mechanical concepts of _ state preparation _ and _ measurement _ are each represented in an ontological model . a preparation @xmath3 of the quantum state @xmath0 actually yields some ontic state @xmath4 . a repetition of the same @xmath3 may yield a different @xmath5 , and the probability distribution of the resulting ontic states , @xmath6 , is called the _ epistemic state _ associated with @xmath0 .",
    "it satisfies @xmath7 the possible outcomes of a measurement of the observable @xmath8 may be labeled by its eigenvalues , or ( as is more convenient here ) by its eigenvectors @xmath9 .",
    "the probability of obtaining the @xmath10th outcome is given by the _ response function _",
    ", @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the particular measurement method used .",
    "if @xmath13 takes on only the values @xmath14 or @xmath15 , the model is called _ outcome - deterministic_. if @xmath13 may take on values between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the model is called _ outcome - indeterministic_.    there may be more than one preparation method , @xmath3 , that yields the same quantum state .",
    "if the epistemic state @xmath6 depends nontrivially on @xmath3 for the same @xmath0 , the model is called _",
    "preparation contextual_. similarly , there may be more than one way to measure @xmath8 .",
    "if the response function @xmath11 depends nontrivially on the method @xmath12 , the model is called _",
    "measurement contextual_. when contextuality is not relevant , the notations @xmath3 and @xmath12 may be omitted for brevity .",
    "the model is required to reproduce the quantum statistics for measurement outcomes . without serious loss of generality",
    ", we may consider only a projective observable , @xmath16 . then if the quantum state @xmath0 is prepared , the probability of a positive outcome of the measurement will be @xmath17    quantum mechanics has an interesting reciprocal relation between state preparation and measurement .",
    "+ _ quantum certainty : _ a system that is prepared in the state @xmath0 will _ always _ pass the test of measuring the projector @xmath18 .",
    "+ _ converse : _ the state @xmath0 is the _ only _ state that will pass the projective measurement filter @xmath18 with certainty .",
    "+ since both _ quantum certainty _ and its converse hold in quantum mechanics , there is a relationship of _ preparation  measurement reciprocity _ , which will be called _ reciprocity _ , for short .",
    "+ an ontological model must satisfy _ quantum certainty _ , otherwise it would not agree with a prediction of quantum mechanics .",
    "hence we must require @xmath19 the _ supports _ , in the ontic state space @xmath2 , of the two functions in the integrand above , are of considerable interest .",
    "define @xmath20 as the subset of @xmath2 for which @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , @xmath22 is the subset of @xmath2 within which @xmath23 is nonzero .",
    "we also define the _ core support _ of the response function , @xmath24 , as the subset of @xmath2 within which @xmath25 .",
    "the relation between core and supp is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "core support core@xmath26 , and total support supp@xmath26 . ]",
    "notice that the range of integration in ( [ q - cert ] ) may be reduced from @xmath2 to the subset @xmath27 , since only there is the integrand nonzero .",
    "but since @xmath28 is non - negative and satisfies ( [ munorm ] ) , the requirement ( [ q - cert ] ) can be satisfied only if @xmath25 for all @xmath5 inside @xmath27 .",
    "hence we conclude that @xmath29    this relation is very useful in clarifying several properties of ontological models .",
    "the first inclusion ensures that any ontic state that may be produced by a preparation of @xmath0 will also pass the projective filter @xmath18 , so the model satisfies _ quantum certainty_. but the _ converse _ need not hold .",
    "it is possible for the set of ontic states that pass the filter @xmath18 with certainty to be larger than the set @xmath27 that can be prepared with the quantum state @xmath0 . thus _",
    "reciprocity _ does not hold for all ontic models .",
    "the condition for _ reciprocity _ is @xmath30 an _ outcome - deterministic _ model satisfies @xmath31 whereas an _ outcome - indeterministic _ model satisfies @xmath32 the inelegant term _ deficiency _ has been used @xcite for the relation @xmath33 .",
    "it is apparent from ( [ mu - core - supp ] ) that _ deficiency _ may alternatively be defined as @xmath34",

    "@xmath0-ontic _ and _ @xmath0-epistemic_. intuitively speaking , _",
    "@xmath0-ontic _ means that the quantum state @xmath0 is an element of physical reality , whereas _",
    "@xmath0-epistemic _ means that @xmath0 is an abstract entity that provides information about the system .",
    "these intuitive notions are supplemented by a more precise mathematical definition .",
    "a model is considered to be _",
    "@xmath0-ontic _ if the specification of the ontic state @xmath5 uniquely determines the quantum state @xmath0 .",
    "for this to be true , it is necessary that the preparations of any pair of different quantum states , @xmath0 and @xmath35 , should yield ontic state distributions whose supports , @xmath27 and @xmath36 , do not overlap .",

    "but since no such models have yet been constructed , the point is moot . )",
    "although the class _ @xmath0-ontic _ was carefully defined , the class _ @xmath0-epistemic _ was merely defined as the complement of _ @xmath0-ontic_. this allows trivial @xmath0-epistemic models , such as ones for which there is only a single pair of states , @xmath0 and @xmath35 , for which @xmath27 and @xmath36 overlap . however , there are nontrivial @xmath0-epistemic models . indeed ,",
    "@xcite have shown that there are _ maximally - nontrivial _",
    "@xmath0-epistemic models , for which the supports @xmath27 and @xmath36 overlap for _ every _ non - orthogonal pair , @xmath0 and @xmath35 .",
    "these models can be constructed for any finite dimension of the hilbert space .    following this line",
    ", the most ambitious goal would be to construct _ maximally - epistemic _ models , for which the overlap probability of any two state vectors , @xmath37 , is fully accounted for by the overlap of the corresponding distributions , @xmath38 and @xmath28 .",
    "a way to implement this condition would be to require that all of the contributions to the integral on the left side of ( [ measurement ] ) should come from the overlap region @xmath39 .",
    "we have the elementary relations @xmath40 ( note : the first line uses @xmath41 from ( [ mu - core - supp ] ) , and the integrals are effectively over @xmath39 . ) a _ maximally - epistemic _ model is defined to satisfy the above relations with the inequality replaced by an equality . if we write @xmath42 where @xmath43 , then the condition for a model to be _ maximally - epistemic _ is @xmath44 for all @xmath35 and @xmath0 .",
    "the kochen - specker model for a spin-@xmath45 system is a nice example of a _ maximally @xmath0-epistemic _ model .",
    "( the original k - s paper predates the framework of ontological models , but both @xcite and @xcite give concise descriptions of the k - s model within this framework . )",
    "however , maroney @xcite has demonstrated that in hilbert spaces of 3 or more dimensions , it is impossible to have @xmath44 for all vectors . if @xmath46 is taken to be a constant , he obtains the bound @xmath47 for 3 dimensions .",
    "much tighter bounds have been obtained for higher hilbert - space dimensions @xcite@xcite .",
    "therefore , _",
    "maximally @xmath0-epistemic _ models do not exist for more than 2 dimensions .",
    "+ maroney s theorem @xcite is surprising , and we should try to better understand its significance . to reproduce the statistical predictions of qm , any model must satisfy @xmath48 a _ maximally @xmath0-epistemic _ model must also satisfy @xmath49 these equations must both hold for all choices of @xmath50 .",
    "we may assume that any @xmath51 can be reached by a preparation of some @xmath50 ( else the unpreparable values of @xmath5 would be superfluous , and could be discarded from the model ) .",
    "therefore , it is necessary that @xmath52 for @xmath53 , and that @xmath54 for @xmath5 outside of @xmath36",
    ". hence @xmath55 this equation says that a _ maximally @xmath0-epistemic _ model must satisfy _ reciprocity _ and _ outcome - determinacy_.    because it will be useful in the next section , i state a corollary of ( [ max - epist3 ] ) : @xmath56 suppose that @xmath57 were to depend nontrivially on the measurement procedure @xmath12 .",
    "we have already shown that @xmath52 for @xmath53 , and is zero elsewhere .",
    "since @xmath36 is fixed by the state preparation , it can not depend on @xmath12 , so there is no way that @xmath57 can acquire dependence on @xmath12 .",
    "thus @xmath58 is actually noncontextual .",
    "returning to the main argument , the _ converse _ of ( [ max - epist3 ] ) is also true .",
    "this can be seen by following the steps backwards to ( [ any - model ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have a new characterization of _ maximally @xmath0-epistemic _ models : @xmath59 it follows from this implication that any ontological model ( @xmath0-ontic included ) can fail to be _ maximally @xmath0-epistemic _ in only two ways .",
    "it can be _ outcome - indeterminate , _ or it can fail to be _ reciprocal _ ( the latter implying that the converse of _ quantum certainty _ does not hold for the model ) . in view of maroney",
    "s theorem , every ontological model ( except for those that treat only 2-d hilbert spaces ) must be either _ outcome - indeterminate _ or _",
    "nonreciprocal_.    in view of the failure of the attempt to explain the indistinguishability of non - orthogonal quantum states by the overlap of the corresponding ontic state probability distributions , we should ask how it is explained within the above two options . if the model is _ outcome - indeterminate _ then the explanation is qualitatively the same as for ordinary qm without any deeper layer of ontic states . it is",
    "not the case that non - orthogonal quantum states can not be distinguished  it is only that they can not be distinguished _",
    "with certainty_. it is a standard problem of quantum information theory to devise an optimal measurement for distinguishing non - orthogonal states . as the two states approach orthogonality , the success rate approaches 100% , and as they approach parallelism the success rate approaches that of pure chance ( 50% ) .",
    "but in all cases , the optimal strategy is better than pure chance .",
    "if the ontic states of the model are accessible , then the predictive power of the model may be greater than that of pure qm .",
    "but there will be no qualitative difference .",
    "the next case appears to be quite different . in the previous case ( _ outcome - indeterminate _ ) we have @xmath60 while in this case ( _ nonreciprocal _ ) , we have @xmath61 yet there is a similarity , in that both cases obey @xmath62 this property that has been burdened @xcite with the undescriptive name _",
    "deficiency_. but since _ non - deficiency _ is equivalent to _ maximally @xmath0-epistemic _ , perhaps the ugly word _",
    "deficiency _ can be laid to rest . far from being a defect of ontological models ,",
    "it is actually an aspect of quantum normality .",
    "example  1 in app .",
    "a ( the beltrametti - bugajski model ) is essentially ordinary qm , without any additional ontic structures , and it exhibits property ( [ defic2 ] ) .",
    "this section began with a discovery  the impossibility of _ maximally @xmath0-epistemic _ models in dimensions greater than 2  that appeared to pose a serious threat to epistemic interpretations of quantum states .",
    "it has concluded by showing that the impossibility of such models is equivalent to two structural features that affect all ontological models , both @xmath0-epistemic and @xmath0-ontic .",
    "so , thus far , both epistemic and ontic interpretations remain viable .",
    "the various concepts of _ contextuality _ have been studied in detail by harrigan and rudolph @xcite and by leifer and maroney @xcite .",
    "the latter paper contains the theorem : @xmath63 both implications are strictly one - directional .",
    "i shall discuss separately the significance of the two parts of this theorem ( for proofs , see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath64 be the probability of obtaining the ontic state @xmath5 from a preparation of the ( pure or mixed ) quantum state @xmath65 by the method @xmath3 .",
    "if this probability depends nontrivially on the preparation method @xmath3 for the same quantum state @xmath65 , this situation is called _ preparation contextuality_.",
    "although this concept could , in principle , be applied to pure states , in practice , it has only been used for states that are ( literally ) mixtures .",
    "it is well known that a mixed state operator can be represented as convex sum of pure components in many ways .",
    "for example , the unpolarized state of an ensemble of spin-@xmath45 particles can be obtained from the following two mixtures : @xmath66 the first equation describes a mixture of eigenstates of spin @xmath67 ( _ up _ and _ down _ ) , while the second describes a mixture of eigenstates of spin @xmath68 ( _ left _ and _ right _ ) .",
    "the state operator @xmath69 is the same in both cases . but are the distributions of ontic states @xmath70 the same in both cases ? for the kochen - specker model ( ex .  2 in app .  a ) , they are not .",
    "the state operator @xmath69 has spherical symmetry , but in the first case , the ontic state distribution has cylindrical symmetry about the z - axis , while in the second case it has cylindrical symmetry about the x - axis .    as was shown in the previous section , _",
    "maximal @xmath0-epistemic _ fails in most cases , therefore , from ( [ prep - max - ks ] ) , _ preparation noncontextuality _ must also fail in those cases . in other words , the ontic state distribution @xmath64 typically depends , not only on the quantum state @xmath65 , but also on the particular mixture used to prepare it",
    ".    should this fact be of concern to the supporters of any particular interpretation of qm ?",
    "i think not .",
    "it is quite common , in both classical and quantum physics , for a higher level theory to be more symmetric than the lower level theory that underlies it .",
    "consider the continuum theory of electrical conductivity , which is described by the conductivity tensor @xmath71 . beneath it",
    "lies the atomic theory , in which electrons flow through a crystal lattice .",
    "the crystal lattice is never isotropic , but if it possesses 4-fold symmetry , then it is easy to show that this implies an isotropic conductivity tensor , @xmath72",
    "this situation  that the higher level theory is more symmetric than the lower level theory beneath it  is typical .",
    "it is not at all surprising that a similar relation should hold between quantum theory and the ontological models .",
