    "charge - density - wave ( cdw ) systems are interesting as they exhibit an order parameter given by the modulation of the charge density of electrons in real space .",
    "often the ordering pattern is commensurate with the lattice , which means the translational invariance of the system is partially broken .",
    "in other cases , the order is incommensurate with the lattice , which proves to be much more difficult to simulate . in electron - mediated cdw s",
    "the ordering disappears by the build - up of subgap states which can open novel conducting channels .",
    "in particular , the cdw has a quantum critical point which is a metal - to - insulator critical point , being insulating at @xmath0 and metallic for nonzero @xmath1 due to the emergence of subgap states at the chemical potential precisely as @xmath1 increases from zero .",
    "we study how these subgap states affect the time - domain pumping of the cdw , especially with regards to photoemission experiments .",
    "recently , there has been significant interest in pump - probe experiments on these materials including photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) , core - level pes ( xps ) , and electron diffraction .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 ,  @xcite @xmath3 ,  @xcite and @xmath4 ,  @xcite were investigated with pump - probe angle - resolved pes , which provides both time and angle resolution .",
    "one of the reasons for performing these experiments was to try to resolve whether the cdw order is mediated by the electrons , by the phonons , or by the electron - phonon coupling@xcite .",
    "time - domain experiments have the potential to separate out these effects on short time scales  electron mediated interactions should be fast , and phonon mediated ones slow on fs time scales . in this sense",
    ", tise has been identified as an electron - mediated cdw ( and possibly an excitonic cdw@xcite ) .",
    "the nonequilibrium driving of these systems has also produced new `` nonequilibrium phases '' which do not occur in equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pes signal in the above experiments showed that the cdw gap generically closes for a short period of time , but at the same time the modulation of the charge density remains nonzero .",
    "the above experiments also displayed oscillations of the pes signal at long times after the pump pulse is gone , which oscillate at the frequency of the phonon responsible for the ordering ; we do not model such behavior in the all - electron model studied here .",
    "an initial theoretical study was conducted on the simplest noninteracting cdw system@xcite .",
    "the pes response shows that the cdw gap closes ( while the order parameter remains nonzero ) when the pump is on and it restores after the pump pulse is turned off .    in order to address how a cdw behaves after being pumped , we calculate the pes response for the cdw ordered phase of the falicov - kimball model.@xcite this model possesses both a metal - insulator phase transition and a transition from uniform to commensurate or incommensurate cdw ordered phases in equilibrium.@xcite it has an exact solution in nonequilibrium@xcite within the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "the equilibrium density of states ( dos ) displays nontrivial behavior in the ordered phase : the width of the cdw gap in the dos ( which occurs at zero temperature ) does not change when the temperature increases , in opposition to what happens in bcs theory@xcite , where the gap in the dos continuously closes as @xmath5 is approached from below .",
    "instead , it initially fills the gap region with subgap states which increase until the gap is fully filled at the critical temperature.@xcite another feature of this model is that there is a critical value of the interaction where the subgap states start to form at the chemical potential just as @xmath1 increases above zero .",
    "this quantum critical state has an instantaneous transition from an insulator at @xmath0 to a metal for any finite temperature .",
    "hence , the falicov - kimball model shows additional correlation effects and our work goes beyond the previous calculations of the pes signal on the simplest noninteracting cdw model.@xcite we expect our results to be useful in experiments on real cdw materials such as those already mentioned above .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] we present the theory for our calculations .",
    "it consists of two subsections : in subsec .",
    "[ subsec:1 ] , we define the time - dependent hamiltonian of system in the cdw ordered state . in subsec .",
    "[ subsec:2 ] , we describe the theory for the photoemission response function . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we present our results for pes function in the cdw ordered phase and discussion .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "we develop the nonequilibrium dmft to solve for the two - time contour - ordered green s function defined on the kadanoff - baym - keldysh time contour .",
    "we generalize the theory to encompass cdw ordered phases of the falicov - kimball model which requires an additional @xmath6 matrix structure .",
    "finally , we derive the formulas for the time - resolved pes response function .",
    "the falicov - kimball model involves two kinds of particles : heavy electrons which are localized on the lattice sites , and light itinerant electrons  @xcite which are allowed to hop between nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the model possesses a transition into a commensurate bipartite cdw ordered phase  @xcite at low temperature . at half - filling ,",
    "this occurs for any value of the coulomb interaction and sufficiently low @xmath1 . employing the kadanoff - baym - keldysh approach@xcite ,",
    "the nonequilibrium dmft formalism was developed previously for the uniform phase@xcite .",
    "recently , we generalized it for the case of the bipartite cdw ordered phase@xcite . here , we only summarize the main steps of the theory to establish our notation .",
    "the ordering arises from the nesting instability of the fermi surface with a modulation wavevector given by @xmath7 .",
    "we employ two sublattices `` @xmath8 '' and `` @xmath9 '' which have different electron density ( in a checkerboard pattern ) .",
    "this implies that the brillouin zone is cut in half and is called the reduced brillouin zone ( rbz ) . to define each sublattice",
    ", we apply the modulation wavevector @xmath10 as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the position vector for the @xmath13th lattice site .",
    "we express the hamiltonian in terms of fermionic annihilation and creation operators with respect to this underlying two - sublattice system .",
    "we can do this either in real space or in momentum space . in the real space picture , we simply add an extra index for the sublattice : @xmath14 performing a fourier transform to momentum space , but with the summation over the lattice restricted to be either over the @xmath8 sublattice or the @xmath9 sublattice only , produces the corresponding momentum - dependent operators @xmath15 . in the momentum space picture ,",
    "we introduce two new operators which define the fermionic operators for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 subspaces as follows : @xmath18 where the momentum @xmath19 is restricted to the rbz and @xmath20 is restricted to the complement of the rbz .",
    "the same notation is employed for the creation operators . applying a fourier transformation , we find that the relation between the real space operators in eq .",
    "( [ cab ] ) and the momentum space operators in eq .",
    "( [ ckq ] ) can be written in matrix form : @xmath21 the matrix @xmath22 is unitary and the @xmath23 factors are chosen to satisfy the standard commutation relations for the fermionic annihilation and creation operators .",
    "the connection between any quantity that is constructed from two operators in the real space representation @xmath24 ( which is a @xmath25 matrix in the ordered state ) , and in the momentum space representation @xmath26 follows from the unitary transformation via @xmath27    employing this notation , the time - dependent hamiltonian of the ordered system is written as @xmath28 where the local term describes the coulomb interaction between the localized and itinerant electrons on the @xmath13th site of the @xmath29th sublattice and the chemical potential ( site energy ) : @xmath30 the number operators of the itinerant and localized electrons are given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the nonlocal kinetic - energy term of the hamiltonian describes hopping of itinerant electrons between the nearest - neighbor sites ( that belong to different sublattices  we will work on an infinite - dimensional hypercubic lattice ) .",
    "we work in units where @xmath33 .    in a pump - probe experiment ,",
    "the material is first irradiated with an intense ultrafast pump pulse to excite the electronic subsystem .",
    "later , a higher frequency , lower amplitude probe pulse is used to measure the temporal evolution of the nonquilibrium electrons . to model this scenario , we choose the pump pulse to be an electric field @xmath34 with a gaussian envelope of the form @xmath35\\exp{[-(t - t_0)^2/\\sigma_p^2]},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the magnitude of the field at time @xmath37 ( the maximum of the pump pulse ) . here",
    ", we assume that the electric field is spatially uniform and that it is directed along the main diagonal in the infinite dimensional space ( 1,1,  ,1 ) .",
    "we also ignore all magnetic field and relativistic effects .",
    "this allows us to describe the electric field via a spatially uniform vector potential in the hamiltonian gauge : @xmath38 we exploit a peierls substitution to the kinetic - energy term of the hamiltonian to describe the interaction between itinerant electrons and the external electric field in eq .",
    "( [ efield ] ) .",
    "hence , the hopping matrix depends on time explicitly as follows @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ( constant ) hopping matrix in the absence of an external electric field .",
    "performing a fourier transformation to momentum space , we rewrite the time - dependent kinetic - energy term in the form @xmath41 here , the extended band energy @xmath42@xcite is off - diagonal in the real space two - sublattice representation @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( we apply the same scaling of the hopping term as in equilibrium dmft ) .",
    "the extended band energy in eq .  ( [ eps ] ) is diagonal in the momentum space representation . by performing the unitary transformation in eq .",
    "( [ transformation ] ) , we obtain for @xmath46 @xmath47 the cdw ordered state is characterized by two order parameters .",
    "the heavy electron order parameter @xmath48 is the difference of the heavy electron occupation on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 sublattices .",
    "it reaches its maximum value of @xmath49 at @xmath0 and becomes equal to @xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "since the heavy electrons do not interact with the external electric field , this order parameter does not change in time and remains fixed at its equilibrium value . while this may seem like an odd behavior , it arises because the heavy electrons arelocalized , and hence they remain fixed , even when a field is applied to the system .",
    "this behavior also occurs in the simplified model where the cdw is determined by a bandstructure with a fixed checkerboard pattern to the site potential . in cdws that arise due to a phonon distortion ,",
    "the order parameter associated with that distortion can relax in time , but the behavior described above is what one would expect to see for short times .",
    "the starting point for our calculations is an equilibrium state at a given temperature . to solve for the order parameter at this temperature",
    ", we avoid critical slowing down of the iterative dmft process by working with a fixed order parameter , which determines the heavy electron filling on each sublattice  @xcite",
    ". then the heavy electron site energies @xmath52 are calculated from the dmft solution .",
    "the order parameter is adjusted until these two energies are equal , signifying the thermodynamic equilibrium state . at this point",
    ", we can determine the order parameter of the conduction electrons ( which never reaches its maximal value of 1/2 due to pauli blocking ) .",
    "it is given by the difference of the itinerant electron filling on the two sublattices @xmath53/2[n_c^a(t)+n_c^b(t)]$ ] .",
    "since itinerant electrons interact with the external electric field , this order parameter changes in time when the field is applied .",
    "indeed , it is even distinct from the heavy electron order parameter when the system is in equilibrium and it can change sign when the external pulse excites the system@xcite .",
    "we exploit the theory for time - resolved , pump - probe , pes developed recently for the normal phase  @xcite .",
    "this theory also holds in the cdw ordered phase , but in this case we have to generalize it for the two - sublattice system .",
    "the pes response function is computed from the lesser green s function , which can be extracted from the contour - ordered green s function .",
    "since the hamiltonian of the system depends on time explicitly , we have to apply the kadanoff - baym - keldysh formalism to solve for the contour - ordered green s function that depends on two times . in this case",
    ", the contour - ordered green s function is defined on the kadanoff - baym - keldysh time contour in fig .",

    "surprisingly , this mott phase has more total excitation than the metal or the quantum critical cdw , both which have smaller spectral gaps .",
    "once again , in the supplemental material@xcite , movies are available that show the sharpening of the peaks , the band narrowing , and the fill in of the gap .",
    "since the pes spectra is convolved with the probe envelope function , we also show how such a convolution affects the equilibrium dos .",

    "in this work , we presented our results on the time - resolved pump - probe pes response function in the cdw ordered phase of the falicov - kimball model .",
    "we described the general formalism to solve for the two - time green s function defined on the kadanoff - baym - keldysh contour within the nonequilibrium dmft in the cdw ordered phase .",
    "these results are numerically exact , but we were forced to restrict ourselves to the time interval @xmath114 $ ] , and to the case of a large electric field amplitude for the pump pulse .",
    "similar calculations for small fields require significantly more computer time .",
    "we examined three cases with different coulomb interactions , which correspond to the correlated metal , the quantum - critical point for the cdw , and the critical point for the mott insulator in normal state .",
    "further , we examined different temperatures , starting from close to zero temperature ( when the system is fully ordered ) , to a temperature above @xmath5 , when the system is in the normal state .",
    "we have also analyzed the role of the form of the probe pulse by comparing the convolved equilibrium dos with the equilibrium dos .",
    "the main counter - intuitive result that we found is that including many - body correlations into the cdw greatly enhances the relaxation and de - excitation of the system . in particular",
    ", the quantum critical case is quite difficult to excite by the pump pulse .",
    "the most likely explanation for why this occurs is that the excitation and de - excitation processes are nearly balanced in this case , making it hard to generate net electron transfer from the lower to the upper band .",
    "_ surprisingly , it is much easier to excite a mott insulator than it is the quantum - critical cdw or a weakly coupled cdw_. we do not have a full understanding as to why and how the quantum correlations conspire to remove the excitations in this system ; this occurs in the absence of a thermal bath that the system is coupled to .",
    "the other interesting result is that there is a significant spectral cdw gap shrinkage , bandwidth narrowing , and peak sharpening in the field - dressed pes , which becomes less pronounced as temperature rises .",
    "some of these features could be related to recent experiments  @xcite , where a partial closing of the spectral cdw gap is seen , but not a full closing .",
