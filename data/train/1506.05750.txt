    "a main concern in extreme value theory , involved in many fields of application , such as e.g. hydrology , biology and finance , is the examination of the tail heaviness of a distribution .",
    "this analysis is deeply concentrated on random variables ( rv ) having survival functions @xmath1 being regularly varying ( rv ) functions , i.e. for some @xmath2 , called the tail index of @xmath1,@xmath3 the class of rv functions with tail index @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "( [ eq:20141020:001 ] ) shows that the notion of tail index is intimately related to the heaviness of the tail of a distribution .",
    "for instance , lower values of tail indices correspond to heavier tails .",
    "hence , a vast literature has been focused on the estimation of this index and its applications as the estimation of extreme quantiles .",
    "see e.g. @xcite and @xcite and the references therein for discussions on estimations of the tail index . a number of estimators of the tail index from a random sample @xmath6 , @xmath7 , ",
    ", @xmath8 have been proposed .",
    "the most well - known estimator is one proposed by hill @xcite in 1975 , which shows favorable features to be used than other competitors ( see e.g. @xcite , pp",
    ". 1181 - 1182 , and @xcite ) in terms of rate of convergence .",
    "more recently , cadena and kratz introduced the class @xmath0 that consists of measurable functions @xmath9 satisfying ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath10 it is not hard to see that the parameter @xmath4 in is unique , hence called the @xmath0-index of @xmath11 , and that @xmath12 may be taken sufficiently small .",
    "@xmath0 is strictly larger than the class of rv functions and the @xmath0-index of @xmath13 is its tail index if @xmath11 is rv ( see e.g. proposition 2.1 in @xcite or theorem 1.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "these authors showed several ways to characterize @xmath0 , i.e. .",
    "the following characterization of @xmath0 given by theorem 1.1 in @xcite or theorem 2.7 in @xcite is of interest in this manuscript . for the sake of completeness of this manuscript ,",
    "its proof is given in appendix , which is copied from theorem 1.1 in @xcite .",
    "[ teock ] let @xmath14 and let @xmath15 be a measurable function .",
    "then , @xmath13 with @xmath0-index @xmath16 , if and only if @xmath17    inspired by , which is related to quantile - quantile plots incorporating logarithm transformations that are frequently used in the extreme value analysis ( see e.g. @xcite ) and have motivated the formulation of estimators of the tail index ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we propose some estimators of the @xmath0-index of a tail of distribution belonging to @xmath0 .",
    "since any rv function belongs to @xmath0 , these estimators are new ones for the tail index .",
    "differences among these estimators and some well - known estimators are pointed out , namely on convergence rates .    in section [ mainresults ]",
    "we define an estimator for the @xmath0-index of @xmath13 and give some of its properties , namely its weak and strong consistency , and its asymptotic normality supposed the tail being rv . in section",

    "this plot is often used to analyze data behaviors related to extreme values .",
    "for instance , when the sample satisfy a strict pareto behavior this relationship is linear .",
    "also , this type of coordinates inspired the formulation of estimators for the tail index , for instance the called qq - estimator ( see @xcite ) .    from a natural estimator for @xmath4",
    "may be formulated .",
    "this is our proposal of estimator , which is given by , for @xmath35 , @xmath36 that may be rewritten as @xmath37 we see that this estimator is also based on the largest values of the sample but unlike most of well - known estimators a unique order statistic is used .",
    "this does not consider necessarily the top values , which are involved in the well - known estimators .",

    "the hill estimator , @xmath127 , shows a better performance than the moment estimator .",
    "this performance improves when @xmath4 decreases or when @xmath91 increases .",
    "in fact , considering @xmath91 , the better situation is when @xmath91 = 10 . observing sample size",

    "the dekkers , einmahl , and de haan estimator , @xmath128 , shows biases in its convergence , being these sharp when @xmath4 = 1 or @xmath4 = 1.5 .",
    "the influences of @xmath91 and @xmath54 on this estimator are not clear .",
    "the new estimator , @xmath47 , shows the best performance with respect to the other estimators presented in this manuscript .",
    "moreover , almost always its convergence is reached and is the fastest , without apparently evidencing any bias .",
    "the worst situation is when @xmath137 ( for @xmath54 = 1 000 and @xmath54 = 10 000 and observing @xmath47 for @xmath138 ) as expected , which was mentioned in remark [ rmqx2 ] .",
    "but , as was also mentioned there , this issue would be mitigated with large sample sizes .",
    "this is observed when @xmath54 = 100 000 , where a sharp convergence is evidenced .",
    "also expected , mentioned in remark [ rmqx2 ] , values of @xmath91 over 1 would promote faster convergences .",
    "this is observed when @xmath91 = 10 , evidencing in these cases the fastest convergence of the new estimator .",
    "also , it is appreciated that the increase of @xmath54 improves the convergence of this estimator .",
    "note that @xmath139 for @xmath140 ( supposed integer ) .",
    "we see that the behavior of this estimator near to @xmath141 is highly unstable .",
    "however , it is amazing the following fact among the plots of @xmath47 when @xmath91 = 0.1 : for @xmath142 with @xmath84 near to @xmath54 , @xmath47 seems to converge to @xmath4 .",
    "this means that to give an estimate of @xmath4 using @xmath47 , some values of @xmath84 over @xmath141 could be used .    from the fact that @xmath139 for @xmath140 , we deduce that when @xmath143 , an unstable behavior of @xmath47 would be expected when @xmath84 approximates @xmath54 .      in this subsection",
    "we evaluate the performance of @xmath47 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 using danish data on large fire insurance losses .",

    "this set consists of 2492 danish fire insurance losses expressed in millions of danish krone ( dkk ) from the years 1980 to 1990 inclusive and have been adjusted to reflect 1985 values .",
    "these data are frequently used in different contexts , namely to evaluate models or estimators . for instance , mcneil @xcite and resnick @xcite evaluate some tail estimators using extreme value theory , considering mainly losses above dkk 1 million .",
    "the latter author concludes a likely value of @xmath144 .",
    "we compute estimates of @xmath47 ( fixing @xmath143 ) , @xmath127 and @xmath128 for both all danish data and data above dkk 1 million . in the latter case",

    "figure [ fig02 ] presents plots of these two cases . to help the interpretation of estimates , a reference line is included at @xmath144 .    in the case of all registers ,",
    "i.e. @xmath145 , all of estimators approximate to or cross @xmath144 , including the new estimator .",
    "however , it seems that the convergence level would be a bit lower since at least @xmath47 ( solid line ) and @xmath127 ( solid line in bold ) seems to oscillate around to @xmath146 .",
    "then , the first estimators reaching convergence seem to be @xmath47 and @xmath127 but presenting oscillations , when @xmath84 is between 250 and 500 .",
    "as @xmath84 is over 500 these estimators make a big oscillation that seems to be completed for @xmath84 over 1 000 . on the other hand , @xmath128 ( dashed line in bold )",
    "shows the slowest convergence with respect to the other competitors . in any way",
    ", it seems that this estimator converges toward @xmath146 when @xmath84 increases over 1 000 .    analyzing losses above dkk 1 million , that gives a sample of @xmath147 observations .",
    "then , the results obtained when @xmath145 hold excepting for the new estimator .",
    "this happens since @xmath127 and @xmath128 depend on the @xmath84 highest values observed , independently of the subsample size of the highest values of a given sample . unlike to these estimators , @xmath47 depends on the sample size .",
    "hence , new estimates of @xmath47 show a different behavior to the ones found when @xmath145 .",
    "they show a trend to decrease from @xmath84 = 200 , without evidencing any convergence .",
    "this fact shows that variations of subsample sizes of the highest values of a given sample may sensibly affect the new estimator .",
    "a simple estimator for the @xmath0-index of the class @xmath0 , larger than the class of regularly varying functions , was formulated .",
    "it has good properties like strong consistency and asymptotic normality , with a better rate of convergence than the one of most well - known estimators .",
    "this last feature is illustrated in simulated examples where estimates converged faster than other competitors , excepting when scale parameters are lower than 1 .",
    "illustrations based on simulations showed that higher scale parameters , lower shape parameters or large sample sizes improve the convergence of the new estimator .",
    "furthermore , in an example using real data the new estimator confirmed estimates given by some classical estimators , when the whole sample was used .",
    "however , estimates given by the new estimator varied when a subsample concentrating on the highest losses was used , showing the sensibility of the new estimator to variations of sample sizes .",
