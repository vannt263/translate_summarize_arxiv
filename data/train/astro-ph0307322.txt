    "many theories address molecular cloud formation , but few observations can distinguish between them . as a result ,",
    "there is little consensus on which process dominates ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "one avenue for testing these theories is to study molecular clouds in a wide range of environments and to determine which aspects of the environment set the cloud properties .",
    "we have adopted this approach in a study of the local group galaxy m33 .",
    "* paper i ) completed a survey of the entire optical disk of m33 in @xmath7 with sufficient sensitivity to detect all molecular clouds more massive than @xmath8 .",
    "this survey represents the first _ flux - limited _ survey of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in any spiral galaxy .",
    "while there are complete surveys of molecular gas in the milky way , blending of emission along the line of sight make it impossible to obtain a complete catalog . the only other flux - limited survey of a molecular cloud population in another galaxy was completed by the nanten group studying the large magellenic cloud @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the ovro interferometer to study m33 gmcs at high resolution ( 20 pc ) , but their observations were limited to clouds in the central 1.5 kpc of the galaxy that are associated with optical extinction and bright single - dish co detections .",
    "this paper is a high resolution follow - up to the survey of paper i , targeting fields known to contain bright gmcs over a large range of galactic radii .",
    "the @xmath9 observations presented in paper i have sufficient linear resolution ( 50 pc ) to resolve the emission into molecular clouds , but not to measure the cloud sizes .",
    "the higher resolution observations presented here ( 20 pc ) resolve most of the gmcs , and provide additional information about their masses , angular momenta and morphologies .",
    "these data show that the gmcs in m33 are similar to those found in the milky way .",
    "in addition , the data constrain cloud formation theories , and they suggest that the co - to - h@xmath5 conversion factor is constant across the galaxy .",
    "we observed 17 fields in @xmath0co @xmath10 using the bima array @xcite in fall 2000 and spring 2001 .",
    "we chose fields that contain the highest mass gmcs cataloged in paper i ( figure [ fields ] ) .",
    "the observations were made in the c - array configuration yielding a synthesized beam fwhm of @xmath11 .",

    "three additional fields ( fields 18 through 20 in table [ table1 ] ) were observed in conjunction with the survey presented in paper i and are discussed in more detail in that paper . because of the longer integration times and smaller synthesized beam sizes , the high resolution observations can detect lower mass clouds than the survey in paper i.    cccccc field & @xmath15 & @xmath16 & beam size & source time & @xmath17 + name & ( 2000 ) & ( 2000 ) & ( ) & ( hours ) & ( jy beam@xmath12 ) + 1 & @xmath18 127 & 30  42  280 & 5.3 @xmath19 5.1 & 8.22 & 0.127 + 2 & @xmath18 876 & 30  39  878 & 5.8 @xmath19 5.4 & 0.872 & 0.199 + 3 & @xmath18 657 & 30  47  508 & 5.7 @xmath19 5.4 & 0.872 & 0.200 + 4 & @xmath20 235 & 30  25  398 & 5.8 @xmath19 4.9 & 0.255 & 0.205 + 5 & @xmath20 410 & 30  46  743 & 5.8 @xmath19 5.2 & 1.34 & 0.159 + 6 & @xmath18 382 & 30  40  381 & 5.8 @xmath19 5.2 & 1.34 & 0.160 + 7 & @xmath20 501 & 30  33  583 & 5.8 @xmath19 5.2 & 1.34 & 0.161 + 8 & @xmath18 107 & 30  42  280 & 6.4 @xmath19 5.4 & 1.88 & 0.178 + 9 & @xmath20 425 & 30  33  661 & 5.7 @xmath19 5.0 & 4.44 & 0.0912 + 10 & @xmath18 220 & 30  38  311 & 6.9 @xmath19 4.9 & 2.34 & 0.212 + 11 & @xmath18 135 & 30  33  442 & 6.5 @xmath19 6.0 & 1.33 & 0.262 + 12 & @xmath20 519 & 30  39  228 & 6.5 @xmath19 6.0 & 1.33 & 0.261 + 13 & @xmath18 342 & 30  46  167 & 6.6 @xmath19 6.3 & 1.45 & 0.221 + 14 & @xmath20 596 & 30  49  108 & 6.5 @xmath19 6.0 & 2.20 & 0.213 + 15 & @xmath18 164 & 30  39  181 & 6.7 @xmath19 6.2 & 1.92 & 0.196 + 16 & @xmath18 105 & 30  36  100 & 6.5 @xmath19 5.8 & 3.09 & 0.234 + 17 & @xmath18 950 & 30  49  120 & 6.7 @xmath19 6.1 & 16.0 & 0.0832 + 18 & @xmath20 583 & 30  41  699 & 6.6 @xmath19 6.6 & 4.00 & 0.155 + 19 & @xmath20 425 & 30  39  130 & 6.6 @xmath19 6.5 & 4.00 & 0.153 + 20 & @xmath20 522 & 30  37  190 & 6.6 @xmath19 6.5 & 4.00 & 0.155 +    our data reduction followed the algorithm developed for the bima survey of nearby galaxies @xcite .",

    "were done before observing each new field to compensate for rapid variations in the thermal stresses on the telescope .",
    "both polarizations were observed with the 500-khz and 1-mhz filter banks in parallel mode .",
    "the median system temperature was 350 k for the observations and the median column of water was 0.7 mm .    the observations used absolute off positions which targeted low - significance detections in the d - array survey ( see paper i ) .",
    "these observations help to establish the completeness limit in the survey by determining the fraction of real detections of low significance .",
    "the positions of the off fields were selected to be well separated in velocity from the strong molecular cloud emission in the on position .",
    "emission in the off fields appears as absorption features in the resulting spectra .",
    "only two of the off fields contained emission at the expected velocities .",
    "we reduced the data by flagging bad channels in every spectrum , combining the polarizations to reduce the noise , and fitting a quadratic baseline .",
    "the vane calibration of the antenna temperature was found to be accurate to better than 10% using continuum observations of jupiter and line observations of dr21(oh ) .",
    "all spectra were observed to an rms noise level of at most 10 mk in a 2.6 km s@xmath12 channel , equivalent to a molecular gas surface density of of 0.1 @xmath22 pc@xmath3 .    finally , we observed a 5 @xmath19 5 pointing mosaic centered on the most massive cloud complex in the galaxy ( field 17 in table [ table1 ] ) to map all flux associated with this cloud .",
    "the single dish map was combined with both the c and d array bima data using miriad s imcomb routine .",
    "the difference between the fully - recovered data cube and the cube generated solely from the interferometer data shows the location and spatial structure of the emission that is detected only by the 12-m telescope .      by comparing the interferometer and single dish data",
    ", we estimate the amount of flux that has been resolved out by the interferometer or not selected by our cloud identification techniques (  [ masking ] ) .",
    "we compare each of the 18 single dish spectra to a representative spectrum generated from the interferometer data by averaging together the spectra in the data cube and correcting for the beam profile of the 12-m . to improve the signal to noise in the interferometer spectrum , only pixels with significant ( @xmath23 ) co emssion",
    "are included in the average .",
    "both the c - array observations and the d - array observations discussed in paper i recover less than 100% of the flux as expected",
    ". the median ratios of the interferometer and single dish integrated intensities ( @xmath24 ) are : @xmath25 because the distribution of this ratio is asymmetric about its median , we quote the positive and negative dispersions separately .",
    "the 12-m observations indicate that a significant fraction of emission is resolved out or masked out ( see  [ masking ] ) .",
    "however , comparing the peak antenna temperatures in the spectra shows that : @xmath26 while the widths of the interferometer lines are narrower : @xmath27    three effects can lead to a discrepancy between the interferometer and single dish data : ( 1 ) calibration errors , ( 2 ) extended co emission resolved out by the interferometer , and ( 3 ) limited sensitivity or masking effects in the interferometer data .",
    "calibration discrepancies would appear as a relative scaling of the observed spectra by a constant factor .",
    "however , the ratios of the peak temperatures and linewidths indicate better flux recovery in the middle of the line . we conclude that scaling alone can not not be the source of flux loss .",
    "observations of the off positions using the 12-m telescope indicate that there is no extended co emission on kiloparsec scales with sufficient surface brightness to account for the discrepancy between the interferometer and the single dish observations .",
    "each of the 18 single dish spectra have a @xmath28 noise level of 0.07 k km s@xmath12 ( 0.3 @xmath22 pc@xmath3 ) ; however , accounting for the observed difference requires a surface brightness of 1.0 k km s@xmath12 ( 4.3 @xmath22 pc@xmath3 ) .",
    "to search for even fainter emission , we averaged together the 16 empty off positions , shifting the velocities to align any faint emission at the velocity .",
    "no line is present in the resulting spectrum , which has a @xmath28 surface brightness sensitivity of 0.019 k km s@xmath12 ( @xmath29 pc@xmath3 ) .",
    "since the off positions are separated by projected distances of roughly a kiloparsec , we conclude that a co emission component on this scale can account for no more than 2% of the discrepancy between the interferometer and the single dish fluxes .",
    "the extra emission detected in the single - dish spectra is likely from low mass clouds surrounding each gmc lying below our clipping threshold .",
    "figure [ diffmap ] compares the map of field 17 generated from interferometer data alone with the map generated by merging interferometer data with the single dish map .",
    "the greyscale image is the fully recovered map and the contours represent the _ additional _ emission seen only in the fully recovered map .",
    "the relative levels of the contours to the greyscale are indicated at the bottom of the scale bar , showing the additional flux recovered is a very low surface brightness component .",
    "taking the fourier transform of the added emission shows that @xmath30 of the added flux would be detected by the interferometer with more integration time .",
    "the spatial filtering of the interferometer occurs only at @xmath14 distances of @xmath31 and does not account for the discrepancy between the two telescopes .",
    "most of the added emission is excluded from the interferometer map simply by virtue of being below the significance threshold for our masking methods . also plotted in figure [ diffmap ]",
    "are the locations of low mass clouds seen only in the c - array data , where the synthesized beam is well matched to the cloud sizes .",
    "two of these clouds appear in the distribution of diffuse emission suggesting clumpy structure within this envelope .",
    "the diffuse emission seems principally associated with the gmcs , and",
    "a discussion of what this observation implies for cloud formation appears in  [ finis ] .",
    "we conclude that the interferometer observations detect the central clouds of complexes in the galaxy containing high mass gmcs ( @xmath32 , paper i ) .",
    "we defined clouds in the position - velocity interferometer data cubes as connected regions in three dimensions containing more than 50 pixels , each with a value greater than @xmath33 .",
    "our criteria guarantee that _ at least _ five statistically independent regions are included in each cloud because interferometer data cubes are oversampled by a factor of 3 in each spatial direction , though the velocity channels are nearly independent . for five joint @xmath34 detections , the likelihood of false detection is @xmath35 in these data cubes which have @xmath36 independent elements .",
    "analysis of the noise in the data indicates that the distribution is sufficiently gaussian to justify such a treatment .",
    "we simulated @xmath37 data sets mimicking the observation conditions , correlator configuration , and baselines of the array .",
    "the cloud extraction program found no false detections for these selection criteria .",
    "this algorithm extracts 45 molecular clouds from the data cubes , including all clouds in these fields cataloged in paper i. to account for low amplitude signal at the edges of the clouds , the regions were expanded by 1 pixel in both the position and the velocity directions .",
    "figure [ maps ] shows maps of the individual clouds .",
    "five of the 45 clouds are not completely recovered since they lie near the half power point of the primary beam .",
    "because their peaks are included in the maps , we estimate that the truncation will not increase their masses and areas by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "the observed parameters of the 45 clouds are listed in table [ cloudprop ] .",
    "the analysis uses a distance to m33 of 850 kpc @xcite .",

    "this discrepancy shows that nearly all clouds suffer an angular momentum problem independent of assuming solid - body rotation .",
    "the failure of the solid body model is particularly troubling since this model gives the minimum accumulation length required to gather the mass of the gmc from the atomic hydrogen .",
    "this constraint will limit even the most sophisticated models of cloud formation .",
    "there are at least two possible solutions to the angular momentum problem .",
    "one is to gather material for molecular clouds from similar galactocentric radii , thereby minimizing the shear in the atomic gas , as may happen in the swing amplification instability @xcite .",
    "if clouds have small radial accumulation lengths , they must have long azimuthal accumulation lengths .",
    "agreement with the observed angular momenta requires @xmath257 pc . to form a cloud of @xmath258 out of atomic hydrogen with a typical surface density of @xmath259 pc@xmath3 requires azimuthal accumulation lengths of @xmath260500 pc . with the maximum non - circular velocities in the atomic gas @xmath261 10 km s@xmath12 @xcite",
    ", this implies a limit on the timescale of cloud formation of @xmath262 myr , larger than the 1020 myr cloud lifetimes implied in paper i. this timescale is a significant fraction of the time between the spiral arm crossings for most of the galaxy away from the co - rotation radius @xcite .",
    "consequently , such a long time scale for cloud formation has difficulties explaining preferentially finding clouds in spiral arms of galaxies .",
    "a second solution is to brake the material with external forces such as magnetic fields .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic effects seem to be critical for shedding angular momentum in the star formation process and may also act in the early stages of cloud formation . if the magnetic field is so dynamically significant as to produce an instability , it may also provide enough tension to brake the clouds during their formation .",
    "@xcite measures the mean field strength in m33 as @xmath263 , which gives an alfvn speed of @xmath2606 km s@xmath12 ( assuming a sech@xmath264 density profile to calculate the midplane volume mass density ) .",
    "this value is comparable to the sound speed in the warm neutral medium of most galaxies , suggesting that mhd braking and cloud formation via instabilities occur on comparable timescales . the braking time is set by the time needed for an alfvn wave to sweep through a volume of diffuse gas with a moment of inertia equal to that of the forming cloud @xcite .",
    "if the atomic gas has a constant density , then the alfvn wave must pass through a distance comparable to the accumulation length for the molecular cloud .",
    "instabilities cause cloud formation on a time scale comparable to the sound crossing time for the accumulation length .",
    "since the crossing times for sound and alfvn waves are comparable , we conclude that mhd braking is a viable option to slow the rotation of forming clouds . because only 10% of clouds show angular momentum approaching the expected values from any of the formation mechanisms ( e.g. figure [ spangcomp ] ) , the mhd braking must occur in the atomic gas or during a small fraction of the molecular cloud lifetime .",
    "we return to the implications of these observations for cloud formation in  [ finis ] .",

    "the variations in the mean hydrogen surface density are small compared to the order of magnitude spanned in mass (  [ comparison ] ) , so the angular momentum is expected to scale with mass for any accumulation model . that @xmath272 instead of @xmath273 may be due to the action of the braking mechanism , though @xmath273 is not strongly ruled out by the poor quality of the fit . such correlation between @xmath220 and @xmath274",
    "is also expected for a turbulent velocity field .",
    "bb00 find that the velocity gradient scales with clouds size @xmath41 as @xmath275 so @xmath276 .",

    "there is no significant variation of specific angular momentum as a function of galactic radius , contrary to the predictions of all the accumulations mechanisms considered here ( figure [ spangcomp ] ) .",
    "this implies that the angular momentum of the clouds does not depend on any of the properties that change across the galactic disk , including galactic shear , surface mass density of stars and atomic gas , interstellar pressure , interstellar radiation field , or metallicity .",
    "the position angle of the angular momentum vector can be measured from the velocity gradients as discussed in  [ velgrad ] .",
    "the data show correlations between the cloud position angles and that of the galaxy as well as among the individual gmcs .",

    "because of the unknown inclination of the clouds relative to the line of sight , we analyze the distribution of position angles statistically .",

    "this pdf is motivated solely for ease of simulation so that a single parameter @xmath15 determines how well aligned the clouds are with the galaxy . by determining the value of @xmath15 that most closely represents the observed distribution of position angles , we measure the degree of alignment between the clouds and the galaxy .",

    "( 1 ) molecular clouds form directly from atomic hydrogen rather than the agglomeration of small molecular clouds .",
    "( 2 ) the formation process makes both low mass and high mass molecular clouds in regions of cloud formation .",
    "( 3 ) the formation events are local , _ i.e. _ length scales less than 500 pc . ( 4 ) the progenitor gas has its initial angular momentum dissipated by mhd effects . ( 5 ) the similarity of molecular clouds across many environments implies that the molecular mass distribution sets the properties of molecular clouds and star formation .",
    "our results complement those of paper i where it is argued that molecular clouds form directly from atomic hydrogen . in that paper",
    ", the striking correspondence between molecular clouds and dense atomic filaments strongly suggests cloud formation from atomic gas .",
    "this work strengthens that suggestion since we find no evidence for diffuse molecular gas that could serve as a precursor to gmcs (  [ fluxrec ] ) .",
    "additionally , the atomic gas is significantly more massive than the molecular component on a global as well as a local ( @xmath307 pc ) scale .",
    "if diffuse _ molecular _ gas were the precursor material , the angular momentum problem would be greatly exacerbated , scaling predicted angular momenta up by a factor of @xmath308 .",
    "we also find that the flux not recovered in paper i survey can be accounted for by halos of molecular gas around the detected gmcs , comprised in part by low mass molecular clouds (  [ fluxrec ] ) .",
    "these low mass clouds may form in the same event as the high mass cloud at the center of the interferometer field .",
    "such low mass molecular clouds would have easily been detectable in the off fields of the 12-m observation and may be restricted to regions where high mass molecular clouds also form .",
    "the position angle correlations in  [ pacorrs ] suggest that the formation of molecular clouds occurs on length scales less than 500 pc",
    ". a common formation event could produce aligned molecular clouds , analogous to the formation of the solar system producing aligned rotation in the planets .",
    "correlations in the orientation of angular momentum can be predicted in simulations of turbulent cloud formation that include realistic models of galactic shear .",
    "such predictions should show the observed degree of alignment with the galaxy and correlations among the gmcs .",
    "the angular momentum problem can be solved by appealing to mhd braking .",
    "forming the molecular clouds from a narrow range of radii requires a long formation time .",
    "formation mechanisms that accumulate gas supersonically can not have any angular momentum dissipated by alfvn waves since the accumulation time is smaller than crossing times for magnetosonic waves .",
    "in contrast , the magnetic field is sufficient to brake forming molecular clouds and braking occurs over timescales comparable to those of instabilities that could potentially form molecular clouds (  [ mhdsec ] ) .",
    "molecular clouds appear to have their macroscopic properties ( @xmath231 , @xmath302 ) set by their masses (  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "in addition , there appears to be a constant star formation rate per unit molecular mass within galaxies @xcite .",
    "if this is true , then the properties of star formation on a galactic scale depend on the amount of atomic gas converted into molecular clouds and little else .",
    "although there are similarities in the properties of molecular clouds for a fixed mass , there is good evidence that the mass distribution of molecular gas into individual clouds varies among galaxies .",
    "different mass spectra may be the hallmark of multiple formation mechanisms converting atomic into molecular gas .",
    "the steep mass spectrum for the molecular clouds in m33 ( paper i ) represents the _ only _ difference in the molecular cloud population between m33 and the milky way .",
    "the mass distribution of molecular gas is thus the dominant factor controlling star formation on a local and galactic scale .",
    "we have presented high resolution follow - up observations to a survey of gmcs in m33 made by @xcite , using the bima array and the uaso 12-m millimeter wave telescope .",
    "a total of 45 individual gmcs were detected .",
    "the uaso 12-m observations measured the total flux in 18 fields , providing information on the flux lost by the interferometer and the presence of a diffuse component of molecular gas . from our observations , we made the following conclusions .",
    "there is no evidence for a diffuse molecular component traced by co spanning the disk of m33 .",
    "we place a @xmath28 surface mass density limit of @xmath309 pc@xmath3 on the presence of such a component .",
    "this is significantly less than the typical surface density of atomic hydrogen , 7 @xmath22 pc@xmath3 .",
    "most of the co flux in the galaxy is associated with gmcs with smaller clouds clustered around the large cloud .",
    "low mass clouds may appear in other parts of the galaxy but are not ubiquitous .",
    "the velocity gradients of the molecular clouds are approximately linear .",
    "the magnitudes of the gradients are comparable to those found in the milky way .",
    "if the gradients are due to rotation , the rotation period is significantly longer than a cloud lifetime ( for @xmath310 myr ) .",
    "gmcs show significantly smaller angular momenta than are predicted by simple formation theories .",
    "the discrepancy is , on average , a factor of 5 and ranges up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "if the velocity gradients are due to turbulent motions , the discrepancy widens by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "both the toomre and parker instabilities predict angular momentum values that are discrepant from observations .",
    "the specific angular momentum is related to mass as @xmath311 .",
    "this value is consistent with the derived value for the galaxy of @xmath312 @xcite .",
    "there is no significant variation of the specific angular momentum with galactocentric radius , though such variations are predicted by all the large scale accumulation theories .",
    "the clouds appear somewhat aligned with the rotation of the galaxy , though a random distribution of position angles is not strongly excluded . if the velocity gradients are from rotation , only @xmath313 of the clouds are prograde rotators .",
    "the projected velocity gradients of neighboring , high - mass clouds are preferentially aligned .",
    "this correlation vanishes for separations larger than 500 pc .",
    "this alignment may be a signature of the large scale mechanisms that dictate the formation of molecular clouds and should be seen in turbulent cloud formation models .",
    "the observed molecular clouds are similar to those found in the milky way .",
    "we find a size ",
    "linewidth relationship of @xmath314 and a mass  line width relationship of @xmath315",
    ". both of these relationships are indistinguishable from those found in the milky way .",
    "there is also no detectable variation in the column density of the molecular clouds with the mass or radius of the clouds .",
    "equivalent virial masses and luminous masses imply that the @xmath180 factor for m33 is equal to @xmath316 .",
    "there is no significant variation of the @xmath180 factor with metallicity over a range of 0.8 dex .",
    "these observations support a model for cloud formation in m33 using atomic gas as the progenitor material for molecular clouds .",
    "the formation process accumulates the atomic gas over a small distance ( @xmath317 pc ) with significant braking by magnetic fields .",
