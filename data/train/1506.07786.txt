    "within the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , lepton flavour is conserved as long as the neutrino masses are exactly zero .",
    "the discovery of massive neutrinos and neutrino oscillations , however , shows that lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) is in principle allowed . for example the process @xmath4 can occur at the one - loop level if a tau - neutrino oscillates into a muon - neutrino within the loop that is supplemented with a charged vector boson . if this mechanism were the only source of lfv then the branching fractions of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 decay channels are non - zero , but tiny  @xmath7 or thereabouts  and clearly unobservable .",
    "many new physics ( np ) scenarios , however , predict much higher branching fractions , very roughly @xmath8 , which are at the edge of observability ( see e.g.  the review in @xcite ) . here and below @xmath9",
    "denotes either a muon or an electron .",
    "if such a decay were to be discovered ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , as is not unrealistic given the hints on deviations from the sm in the lepton sector with the recent measurements is @xmath10 away from the sm expectation @xmath11 and challenges the notion of lepton - flavour universality .",
    "] of @xmath12 by the lhcb collaboration @xcite and the lfv higgs decay @xmath13 by the cms experiment @xcite , it will be highly interesting to investigate the underlying interaction structure in order to disentangle possible np models . in this paper",
    "we employ a bottom - up approach and treat the sm as an effective field theory , i.e.  we consider higher - dimensional operators that consist only of sm fields and respect sm symmetries .",
    "our aim is to gain qualitative and quantitative information on the couplings of these operators .",
    "it is obvious that such an approach will allow us to only gain direct insight into the couplings at the _ low scale _  set by the tau - lepton mass  and not at the high scale of the responsible np mechanisms .",
    "the implementation of the renormalization - group running of the couplings , which has been derived at one - loop level in @xcite , is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "as some of us have shown in a previous publication @xcite , the @xmath14 decays are mediated by a handful of dimension-6 operators with possibly complex coefficients . in that publication a dalitz - plot analysis was entertained in order to differentiate between radiative and leptonic operators .",
    "clearly , a reconstruction of a dalitz distribution requires a large data sample which obviously is hard to obtain for a very rare , lepton number violating decay .",
    "thus , in order to obtain information on the type of operator that mediates the decay and on the helicity structure of the interaction , appropriate observables need to be defined .",
    "obvious candidates are observables such as forward - backward asymmetries , which can be measured even at very low statistics .",
    "our strategy is therefore to define observables of partially integrated phase space , which can be measured by a simple counting experiment .",
    "additional information on the structure of the interaction can be gained by studying the decay of polarized tau leptons @xcite .",
    "such a polarization can be realized at @xmath15 colliders @xcite running close to the @xmath16 threshold with polarized electrons or electrons and positrons .",
    "as we shall show in this paper , taking into account the spin direction of the decaying tau lepton allows us to obtain information on the structure of the interaction , even with quite small data samples .",
    "the idea of using polarized tau leptons has also been discussed in @xcite , however , in the context of a specific np model .",
    "our focus is a general analysis in order to pin down the structure of the relevant interaction .",
    "considering the possible lfv tau decays into leptons one may classify the six distinct channels as ( a ) @xmath17 with @xmath18 , or ( b ) @xmath19 , or ( c ) @xmath20 .",
    "the processes in @xmath21 and @xmath22 involve identical particles in the final state , whereas @xmath23 does not .",
    "radiative operators contribute to classes @xmath21 and @xmath23 , but not @xmath22 . for definiteness and simplicity",
    "we focus our attention solely on case @xmath21 , in which two external mass scales suffice , the mass of the tau lepton , @xmath24 , and the mass of the lighter lepton , @xmath25 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the next section we define the effective hamiltonian with open coefficients @xmath26 , where @xmath27 counts through the various operators of mass - dimension 6 .",
    "the setup of our calculation is described in detail , including the polarisation vector of the initial tau and the angles characterizing the position of the polarisation vector relative to the decay plane . as a result",
    "the totally differential decay rate is decomposed in terms of trigonometric functions of these angles . in chapter  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we integrate the differential decay rate over the relevant parts of the phase space .",
    "the results are rather bulky in print , so we have diverted them to the appendix for easier reading .",
    "chapter  [ sec:4 ] consists of a phenomenological study of the two decay channels @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the main question we try to answer is how well one could determine the wilson coefficients of the dimension-6 operators under the hypothesis of having discovered a low number of events experimentally .",
    "we summarize in chapter  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "in the following , we adopt the conventions and notation of @xcite .",
    "( for more details we also refer the reader to that reference . ) .",
    "starting point is the most general set of dimension - six operators respecting the sm gauge symmetries ( see @xcite ) . after integrating out the weak gauge bosons and the higgs field after electroweak symmetry breaking , there remain four purely leptonic 4-fermion operators of dimension six . ordering the operators by the chirality of the involved lepton fields",
    ", they can be expressed as @xmath30 where we have already singled out the @xmath1-lepton fields . in this notation ,",
    "the chirality structure @xmath31 can be fierz transformed to contribute to @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "notice that in order to feed terms of the form @xmath34 , one would have to include dimension - eight operators in the sm effective field theory .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the np scale @xmath35 is sufficiently large compared to the electroweak scale , that these contributions can be neglected ( for similar reasoning in other context , see e.g.@xcite ) . in an explicit uv completion of the sm",
    ", the dimensionless couplings @xmath36 should be determined from a matching calculation .",
    "+ similarly , one generates radiative operators , where , at low energies , only couplings to the photon field have to be considered .",
    "( contributions from intermediate @xmath37 or @xmath38 bosons are already contained in ( [ eq:1 ] ) . )",
    "we are then left with two more terms in the effective hamiltonian , @xmath39 they contribute to the @xmath17 amplitude via photon exchange , schematically @xmath40 here , for simplicity , we used the same notation for lepton fields and on - shell spinors , @xmath41 denotes the momentum flow through the virtual photon , and @xmath42 the usual electromagnetic fine - structure constant . in summary , the generic effective hamiltonian for @xmath43 decays can be written as @xmath44 for future convenience we shall combine the six couplings into a complex - valued vector @xmath45 of mass dimension ( -2 ) .",
    "the spin polarization of a beam of particles is typically measured in the flight direction of said particles . in the setup of our calculation",
    "we will define the @xmath46-axis of our lab - frame coordinate system to be the flight direction of the tau lepton .",
    "the reference vector for the spin orientation is then chosen as @xmath47 in the tau lepton s rest frame , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in the calculation of the squared amplitude @xmath50",
    "we will then use the dirac matrix @xmath51 to project onto tau leptons with `` spin - up '' . in this way",
    "the spin vector @xmath52 only appears at most linearly in the squared amplitude .",
    "note that there are then only three linearly independent invariants that one can build from @xmath52 and the lepton momenta in the decay @xmath53 .",
    "these can be taken as @xmath54 and therefore the squared amplitude of the spin - up tau decay can be decomposed as @xmath55 similarly the decay of a `` spin - down '' polarized tau lepton can be calculated with the help of the projector @xmath56 .",
    "we stress that the direction in which the spin is measured , i.e.  the @xmath46-axis ( or reference vector @xmath52 ) remains fixed . with this point of view to find the differential decay rate of a `` spin - down '' polarized tau . ]",
    "the variables defined in ( [ eq:7 ] ) remain unchanged when describing the decay of a spin - down rather than spin - up tau lepton . in this spin - down case one",
    "finds the same functions @xmath57 from above that describe the squared amplitude , albeit in the combination @xmath58 therefore only the part @xmath59 contributes to the _ unpolarized _ decay rate .",
    "the information contained in the functions @xmath60 would then be lost and could not be used in the effort to unveil the underlying operator structure . in what follows",
    ", we will use a slightly modified version of the decomposition ( [ eq:8 ] ) based on angles associated with these invariants .",
    "the three momenta @xmath61 of the decay product span the decay plane . in general",
    "the spin direction @xmath62 does not lie in this decay plane , and its orientation can be described with the help of two angles .",
    "for example , the angle between the normal of the decay plane and @xmath62 is the first , and the angle between the momentum @xmath63 of the antilepton and the projection of @xmath62 into the decay plane the second angle . for convenience",
    "we employ the technique of euler rotations instead , which also serve to define the orientation of @xmath62 and the decay plane : + we define the lab frame as the reference frame ( rf ) in which the tau lepton is at rest and the z - axis is aligned with the spin vector @xmath64 .",
    "we will now perform rotations until this plane is spanned by the new basis vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore the antilepton s momentum shall point directly in the @xmath66 direction .",
    "this new rf is called the decay frame , or rf. we define the following order of rotations to get from rf to rf : @xmath67 with mathematically positive convention : @xmath68 hence the polarization direction vector in rf reads @xmath69 note that there is no dependence on the first rotation angle @xmath70 , which reflects the azimuthal symmetry of the problem .",
    "the rotations are such that the decay plane coincides with the @xmath71 plane , so that we may parameterize @xmath72 where the parameter @xmath73 has a physical interpretation of the angle between @xmath74 and @xmath75 within the decay plane , which is independent of the rotation angles @xmath76 .",
    "the lengths of the 3-vectors @xmath77 and similarly @xmath78 are expressed in terms of the energies @xmath79 as @xmath80 while the momentum of the antilepton , @xmath63 , is well defined , the lepton pair in the final state is indistinguishable if the leptons are of the same flavour , and we must be careful not to double count . + for the last euler rotation , it is sufficient to consider values of @xmath81 to lock the decay plane into the @xmath71 plane",
    ". therefore , in total we restrict the values of the rotation angles as @xmath82 furthermore it is obvious that either @xmath83 has a positive @xmath84 component and @xmath85 a negative one , or the other way around .",
    "the parameter @xmath86 is well defined as the angle between @xmath74 and @xmath75 if we insist on naming that lepton s momentum @xmath74 which has a positive is negative definite . ]",
    "@xmath84 component , i.e. @xmath87 ( however , the squared amplitudes , which we are going to calculate , will be symmetric under the exchange of @xmath88 , as they must for identical particles in the final state . ) + in terms of the angles and energies the invariants in ( [ eq:7 ] ) are @xmath89 therefore we may decompose the squared amplitude in ( [ eq:8 ] ) in terms of the trigonometric functions that appear above instead of the invariants themselves .",
    "specifically we have +   + this setup allows us to quite easily pick out the individual contributions from @xmath90 to @xmath91 by folding the differential decay rate with appropriate weight functions .      besides the angles in ( [ eq:15 ] ) we choose two of the three energies of the final - state leptons , which in the rest frame of the tau satisfy @xmath92",
    "it is a straight - forward exercise to show that the totally differential decay rate is then given by @xmath93 since @xmath94 does not depend on the angle @xmath70 one can trivially integrate over the allowed range .",
    "the phase space for the energies @xmath95 and @xmath96 is nearly triangular with edges that are smoothened out by the light - lepton mass @xmath25 .",
    "one way of expressing the phase - space boundaries is , for example , @xmath97 where @xmath98 as before , and @xmath99 is a function of @xmath95 that is near 1 , except when @xmath95 is near the endpoint where @xmath100 rapidly falls to zero .",
    "sometimes it is more advantageous to express these energies in dalitz - like invariants @xmath101 , for example when addressing the momentum flowing through the virtual photon in the radiative operators in ( [ eq:2 ] ) . in terms of @xmath102",
    "the energies are @xmath103 for later reference",
    "we also state the phase - space region in which @xmath104 , which is @xmath105 similarly , for @xmath106 , we have the restrictions @xmath107 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show the phase space for all kinematically allowed values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 mentioned in equation  ( [ eq:20 ] ) as well as for the regions defined by ( [ eq:23 ] ) and ( [ eq:24 ] ) .",
    "in this section we will use the formulae from the last chapter to define observables , which can be measured even with sparse data samples .",
    "all the observables will be defined from the coarsely sliced phase space using the angular variables , so that the observables correspond to partial rates and forward - backward asymmetries with respect to the angles , which also involve the direction of the tau - lepton polarization .",
    "since lepton - flavour violating processes are rare , we focus on observables where the available phase space in @xmath108 is at least partially integrated .",
    "there are many such observables , and a measurement of them will allow us to draw conclusions on the underlying operator structures .",
    "we start by considering the integration of @xmath109 over the energies @xmath95 and @xmath96 in some region `` r '' of the phase space .",
    "the results are bilinears in the couplings @xmath110 in ( [ eq:4 ] ) , and can be expressed in terms of @xmath111 hermitian matrices @xmath112 that depend on the region r , to wit @xmath113 from this notation it is obvious that the doubly differential decay rate in @xmath114 is obtained by integration over the full energy phase space ( [ eq:20 ] ) , @xmath115 \\xi\\;,\\ ] ] from which asymmetries using @xmath114 are readily calculable .",
    "for example , the difference in the partial rates @xmath116 will only involve @xmath117 .",
    "we may express this difference as the convolution integral over the differential decay rate ( [ eq:26 ] ) with the weight function @xmath118 $ ] , where @xmath119 is the heaviside step function . in order to demonstrate that one can pick out each individual matrix using partial rates we note that @xmath120 \\xi\\;,\\ ] ] and list the coefficients @xmath121 for a few typical weight functions in table  [ tab : weights ] .",
    "( note the factor of @xmath122 that has been absorbed into the prefactor . )",
    ".[tab : weights]coefficients of the linear combination in ( [ eq:27 ] ) for a few typical weight functions .",
    "since the matrices @xmath112 depend on the region r in the energy phase space we leave the upper index @xmath123 on the partial rates open .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the central values for the asymmetry ( [ eq:65 ] ) in these two scenarios is @xmath124 .",
    "we show the outcome of 1000 simulations for each @xmath125 in table  [ tab:7 ] .",
    "it is notable that even very few events suffice for the distinction of these two scenarios .",
    "since the decay @xmath14 is very clean , already a single event of this type would immediately imply new physics , since the prediction of the standard model ( extended by including the neutrino masses through the weinberg operator ) is practically zero .",
    "however , once such a decay would be observed , the nature of the underlying interaction has to be uncovered . in general",
    "this would require to study decay distributions , which is impossible with only a few events .    in this paper",
    "we have studied the lfv decays of tau leptons into three muons or electrons , including a polarization of the tau lepton .",
    "such a polarization can be generated from running an @xmath126 collider in the vicinity of the @xmath127 threshold with polarized electrons and/or positrons .",
    "experimentally this could be realized at bes iii , once a polarization of the beams would become possible .",
    "we have considered a general , model - independent set - up for the interaction mediating the @xmath1 decay , which amounts to parameterizing the effective interaction in terms of a few operators .",
    "any specific model would correspond to specific values for the coupling constants in front of theses operators , and hence even a rough measurement of these couplings could discriminate between different np models .    however , when determining the couplings in view of very sparse data samples we are required to define proper observables , which we have discussed in this paper .",
    "all observables are of the same nature as a forward - backward asymmetry , and therefore can be measured by a simple counting experiment .    on this basis we have performed a feasibility study on how precisely one could assess the values of individual lfv couplings , based on only a small number of total signal events .",
    "it turns out that for some simplified cases ( i.e.  assuming short - distance coefficients to be real , or particular chiral patterns ) different np scenarios could already be distinguished with a quite small number of events . in the case",
    "that lfv could be experimentally established , our procedure could be easily extended by refining the binning for the energy phase space and by including independent information on radiative @xmath128 decays .",
