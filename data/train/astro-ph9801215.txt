    "the x - ray source cep x-4 was discovered in a transient high level x - ray flux in 1972 by the satellite oso-7 ( ulmer et al .",
    "early positions , accurate only to a fraction of degree , led to a suggested identification with the massive o6.5v star hd 206267 , responsible for the excitation of the ic 1396 nebula ( liller 1974 ) , though further observations did not confirm the identification ( hensberge & hammerschlag 1975 ) .",
    "the source was not detected again by an x - ray satellite till the observation of a new outburst by ginga in april 1988 . from these observations ,",
    "coherent 66s pulsations were reported , revealing an x - ray pulsar with a complex x - ray spectrum , including a possible 30kev cyclotron absorption feature ( koyama et al .",

    "the position of the pulsar cep x-4/gs2138 + 56 was refined to a ( 15x6 ) error box and , assuming circularity , doppler changes of the x - ray pulses were used to constrain the orbit to a period more than 23 days , suggesting a massive x - ray binary .",
    "a new outburst , detected in 1993 by the rosat satellite during pointed observations and a residual faint emission when the source has declined by a factor more than 1000 , were used to further refine the position ( schulz , kahabka & zinnecker 1995 ) .",

    "preliminary results were given in bonnet - bidaud & mouchet ( 1997 ) .",

    "series of ( 375 - 725 nm ) low resolution spectra were recorded through a long slit ( 2.3 \" x 5 ) aperture with typical exposure times of 15 min , covering 1 hr and 2.5 hr , respectively during the two nights .",
    "calibration spectra using an helium lamp were recorded at 1 hr interval and before and after the observations , from which a typical resolution of 1.3 nm was measured .",

    "we also identify the fe multiplet complex in emission at 501.7 , 517.0 and 531.5 nm , as well as shortward of h@xmath11 at 462.8 and 472.8 nm .",

    "spectral variability has been searched both in the continuum and lines .",
    "the h@xmath10 and h@xmath11 ew were found only slightly variable by 4.4% and 2.5% respectively , while the continuum varies by less than 10 % over the two days of observations .",
    "the h@xmath10 is broad with a deconvolved fwhm of ( 530@xmath340 ) km.s@xmath5 . using the empirical relation between the width and ew of the h@xmath10 line derived by dachs et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , this corresponds to a projected rotational velocity of ( 460@xmath350 ) km.s@xmath5 .",
    "the spectrum of the suggested cepheus x-4 optical counterpart appears typical of a be star with a strong h@xmath10 line in emission and a balmer series turning to absorption shortward of h@xmath13 .",
    "the probability to find such an active star inside the small ( 15x6 ) error box of an x - ray source is sufficiently low to consider that the object is indeed the optical counterpart of the 66s x - ray pulsar cepheus x-4 .",
    "the significance of the coincidence may be altered as the source is located in the line of sight of the open cluster , trumpler 37 , at the center of an ob association , but a be star located in the cluster will appear much more luminous ( see below ) .",
    "the high excitation heii ( 468.6 nm ) line is not always present in x - ray stars and its absence here may results from an x - ray low state .",
    "+ based on the compilation by reig et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we note that the star is the second brightest in h@xmath10 among other identified be / x - ray binaries ( see table 1 ) . assuming the approximate linear relation suggested by reig et al .",
    "( 1997 ) between h@xmath10 ew and the orbital period , yields an orbit of the order of 130 - 170 days , of the same order than the @xmath15 100 days period derived from the p@xmath16-p@xmath17 correlation ( koyama et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "significant constraints on the system can be derived from the shape of the continuum . a sample of representative spectra from o8 to b7 stars among classes iii and v was selected from the library of jacoby et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and the continuum in regions free of lines was fitted , using standard @xmath18 method , to the observed source spectrum after correcting for interstellar absorption .",
    "dereddening was applied according to the mean galactic law of seaton ( 1979 ) with values of e@xmath2 ranging from 0 to 2.0 .",
    "+ figure 4 shows the result of the fit .",
    "the best agreement is obtained for e@xmath2=1.3@xmath30.1 , where the range corresponds to 1@xmath19 error bars for a 2dim-@xmath18 fit .",
    "the fit only loosely constrains the spectral type between 09v and b4v .",
    "however , additional clues on the nature of the star are also given by the line spectrum .",
    "the absence of the heii pickering series is consistent with a spectral type at or later than b0 ( walborn and fitzpatrick 1990 ) while the presence of the hei lines in absorption constrains to types earlier than b5-b7 ( collins & sonneborn 1977 ) .",
    "the hei lines may however be affected by the veiling effect , a filling of the underlying absorption spectrum by the emission from the envelope . on the other hand ,",
    "the feii lines are clearly seen , which , according to jaschek et al .",
    "( 1980 ) is expected from spectral types peaking at b2 .",
    "this is also in accordance with the absence of significant siii ( 412.8 nm ) and mgii ( 448.1 nm ) lines whose contribution increases towards types later than b2 ( walborn & fitzpatrick 1990 ) , though the moderate resolution somewhat limits this conclusion .",
    "the most probable spectral type is therefore a b1-b2v star .",
    "a significant amount of interstellar absorption is visible in the spectrum with a strong nad line with ew=0.32@xmath30.03 nm and pronounced diffuse interstellar bands , including the dib ( 443 nm ) with ew = 0.28@xmath30.02 nm ( see table 1 ) .",
    "based on observations of stars with e@xmath2 ranging from 0 to 1.5 , a nearly linear relation between the ew of the dib(443 nm ) and the colour excess e@xmath2 has been derived by various authors . from the observed dib ew , values of e@xmath2=1.1 - 1.3 and",
    "e@xmath2=1.0 - 1.2 are derived , using relations by herbig ( 1975 ) and tg & schmidt - kaler ( 1981 ) respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the one derived from the continuum fit . + a discrepant result is however obtained if one uses the nad line as a tracer of interstellar absorption . using the parabolic relation nad1/e@xmath2 , recently derived by munari & zwitter ( 1997 ) from observations of nearby stars , and assuming equal contribution from each component of the doublet , a value of e@xmath20 1.3 would correspond to a nad ew of @xmath15 0.15 nm , approximatively half the observed value .",
    "the observed nad in cepheus x-4 is indeed the highest among the sources in table 1 , irrespective of the distance .",
    "this could result from peculiar abundances in the interstellar medium but also more likely from possible circumstellar contribution .",
    "circumstellar sodium has been reported in the be shell star @xmath21 tau by delplace ( 1970 ) with ew up to 0.26 nm . the observed excess of ew@xmath150.17 nm , could possibly have the same origin .",
    "we note that such absorption is usually detected mostly among be `` shell '' stars .",
    "the high rotational velocity derived from the h@xmath10 line width ( 460 km.s@xmath5 ) is close to the break - up velocity ( 470 - 520 ) km.s@xmath5 of b1-b2v stars ( collins & sonneborn 1977 ) , so that an inclination of the equatorial plane greater than ( 65 - 80)@xmath9 is indicated , which could explain the similarity of cepheus x-4 with the be - shell class .",
    "+      reddening towards the star hd239725 ( star 12 ) , in the foreground open cluster trumpler 37 , at a projected small distance of the source , has been measured to e@xmath2=0.46 ( clayton & fitzpatrick 1987 ) , so that the cepheus x-4 counterpart is clearly located behind the cluster . assuming a standard gas - to - dust ratio ( ryter et al .",
    "1975 ) , the reddening implies a n@xmath22 column density in the direction of the source of n@xmath22 = ( 8.8@xmath30.8 ) 10@xmath23 at.@xmath24 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the x - ray column density of n@xmath22 = ( 7.9@xmath31.9 ) 10@xmath23 at.@xmath24 derived by schulz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) from x - ray spectra . with a mean interstellar density",
    "n@xmath25 1 at.@xmath26 , this corresponds to a distance greater than ( 2.9@xmath30.2 ) kpc . at a galactic position of ( l@xmath27=99.01@xmath9 , b@xmath27=+3.31@xmath9 ) ,",
    "the source is located in the plane of the galaxy in the direction of the outer perseus arm .",
    "the total column density of neutral hydrogen at this position is n@xmath28 @xmath15 9.4 10@xmath23 at.@xmath24 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) so that the source is close to the most outer part of the galaxy . in this direction ,",
    "the leiden - greenbank hi survey ( burton 1985 ) clearly reveals distinct galactic structures at v@xmath15 - 10 km.s@xmath5 and v@xmath15 - 80 km.s@xmath5 .",
    "based on a detailed hi study of this region , simonson & van someren greve ( 1976 ) concluded to the superposition of three separate galactic contributions , a local star population at @xmath15 400 pc , the cep ob2 association including the ic1396 nebula at @xmath15 830 pc and a group of luminous stars at 3 - 5 kpc which corresponds to the perseus arm . in view of this galactic structure and of the distance derived from reddening ,",
    "it is most likely that the cepheus x-4 counterpart belongs to this last group . + the observed m@xmath6=14.2 magnitude with a reddening of e@xmath2@xmath151.3 and an absolute magnitude of mv=-(2.5 - 3.8 )",
    ", corresponding to b1v - b2v stars ( balona & crampton 1974 ) as indicated by our spectral results , corresponds to a distance d=(3.8@xmath30.6 ) kpc in accordance with such location .    with the lack of distance determination and the spatial coincidence with the cep ob2 association , schulz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have suspected that the x - ray source may be located at d@xmath29kpc , leading to the weakest observed quiescence luminosity among be / x - ray binaries .",
    "our distance determination implies instead a luminosity in quiescence , lx(0.1 - 100kev)=(3.3 - 6.2 ) 10@xmath4 erg.s@xmath5 and in outburst lx=(0.6 - 1.2 ) 10@xmath30 erg.s@xmath5 , in the normal range of what is observed among typical be / x - ray binaries ( apparao 1994 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "optical spectra of the cepheus x-4 transient x - ray pulsar appear fully consistent with a be / x - ray system located at a distance of d@xmath154kpc , in the outer perseus arm of the galaxy .",
    "the optical spectrum indicates a b1-b2v companion showing one of the strongest h@xmath10 emissions among be / x - ray binaries and a significative excess of absorption in the sodium line with respect to what expected from a purely interstellar origin .",
