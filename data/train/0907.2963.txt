    "the dependence of the quasar black hole mass ( @xmath4 ) on redshift is of fundamental cosmological interest , since it is a direct probe of the supermassive black hole ( bh ) formation and evolution and of the triggering of the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) phenomenon .",
    "a full understanding of the cosmic evolution of quasar population would also give important insights into the joint formation of bhs and their host galaxies .",
    "the basic procedure for the determination of the bh mass of agn is through a direct application of the virial theorem . in the hypothesis that the clouds responsible for broad lines emission move in keplerian orbits ( see e.g.  peterson & wandel 2000 for supporting evidence ) , the mass depends on the clouds velocity , which is constrained by the line - width , and the cloud distance , that was shown to be strictly linked to the continuum intensity ( e.g.  kaspi et al .  2000 ;",
    "vestergaard 2002 ; kaspi et al .  2005",
    "; see also references in section 2 ) .    in order to explore the @xmath4(@xmath0 ) dependence",
    ", one should take into account the malmquist bias , related to the minimum detectable flux , which affects all the large samples of quasars and is apparent as an increase of the average observed luminosity with @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath4  is related to the nuclear luminosity , a malmquist - type bias also affects the apparent trend of quasar bh masses ( see e.g.  vestergaard et al .",
    "2008 and kelly , vestergaard & fan 2009 for a detailed bias analysis ) .    in a previous paper ( labita et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter paper i ) we proposed a procedure to trace the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath4 overcoming the problems related to the malmquist bias .",
    "we considered the @xmath5 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 5 ( dr5 , schneider et al .  2007 ;",
    "see also richards et al .",
    "2002 ) for which mgii  line - width ( fwhm ) and 3000   continuum luminosity were measured ( shen et al .",
    "our scheme requires to fit the distribution of quasars in the luminosity  fwhm plane ( see also fine et al .",
    "2008 ) , using as free parameters the maximum mass , the eddington ratio limit and the minimum detectable luminosity .",
    "we obtained a dependence with redshift of the type @xmath6 in the interval @xmath7 , which indicates that most massive bhs exhibit quasar activity at smaller cosmic times than less massive ones ( downsizing , e.g.  merloni 2004 and shankar , weinberg & miralda - escud 2009 for a theoretical approach ) .    here",
    "we apply the analysis described in paper i on the sdss quasar sample for which civ  based virial bh mass estimates can be derived ( section [ secprocedurec4 ] ) .",
    "this extends the study of the @xmath0-dependence of the mass of active black holes to @xmath8 , including the redshift region where the quasar activity is maximal ( @xmath9 , e.g.   richards et al .",
    "to improve the coverage of the low redshift region , which is only marginally described by mgii  data , the adopted procedure is also applied to the sdss quasars for which the virial bh mass can be derived from measurements of the h@xmath1  spectral range ( section [ secprocedurehb ] ) .    the dependence on redshift of quasar bh mass from the h@xmath1 , mgii  and civ  analysis is derived in section [ evol ] , and the results are discussed in section [ sd ] . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time the @xmath4(@xmath0 ) dependence of active black holes is derived beyond the peak of quasar activity from a large sample of agn , taking into account the problems related to the malmquist bias .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a concordant cosmology with @xmath10  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "shen et al . ( 2008 ) studied @xmath14 quasars included in the sdss dr5 quasar catalogue . for @xmath15 of them ,",
    "they provide rest - frame line widths and monochromatic luminosities at 5100  , 3000   and 1350  from which it is possible to evaluate the bh mass through the virial theorem ( see shen et al .",

    "all together , the h@xmath1 , mgii  and civ  samples cover @xmath15 objects and spread over a wide redshift range , from @xmath21 to @xmath8 ( see table [ tabsample ] and fig .",

    "it is worth to notice that the @xmath25 of the three best - fitting lines are all smaller than 1 and this may indicate that the monte carlo procedure overestimates the errors on the @xmath24 values .",

    "[ mmax_zall ] also describes the trend in redshift of the mean quasar bh mass .",
    "we conclude that quasar samples at higher @xmath0 are increasingly dominated by higher mass bhs , i.e. the lower is the mass the longer is the cosmic age at which quasars exhibit their activity .",
    "more precisely , we find evidence that the most massive black holes _ stop _ nuclear activity before less massive ones , since we describe the upper envelope of the bh mass distribution .",

    "2006 and decarli et al .  in preparation , see section 4.3 of paper i for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "our results are in agreement with recent theoretical predictions by e.g. merloni ( 2004 ) and merloni , rudnick & di matteo ( 2006 ) , who studied the redshift evolution of the bh mass function and computed the average mass of supermassive active black holes as a function of @xmath0 through models accounting for radiatively efficient and inefficient bh accretion .",
    "there is also consistency with models by e.g.  shankar , weinberg & miralda - escud ( 2009 ) , who studied agn duty - cycles through bh accretion models to predict the @xmath0-dependence of the minimum bh mass at which supermassive black holes start to exhibit nuclear activity . the results by marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who modeled with similar methods the @xmath0-dependence of the bh mass of active bhs that accreted a fixed fraction of their total mass ( i.e. , which entered their agn phase ) , are also qualitatively consistent with our findings .",
    "[ m_z_literature ] also shows the @xmath29 trend corresponding to a minimum detected flux , which is representative of the effects of a malmquist - type bias on the observed average bh mass redshift dependence . in detail , we considered a survey flux limit that roughly corresponds to that of the sdss quasar selection algorithm ( @xmath30 at @xmath31 and @xmath32 at @xmath33 , see section [ secprocedurec4 ] and references therein ) . from the luminosity dependence of the virial bh mass estimator",
    "( see section 2 ) we estimate the corresponding mass limit at a given fwhm as a function of redshift .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ m_z_literature ] that the derived bh mass trend traces the observed average @xmath34 @xmath0-dependence of the sdss quasars at any redshift , thus confirming that it is dominated by the malmquist bias . on the other hand ,",

    "we presented the application of a procedure which allows the determination of the @xmath0-dependence of the bh mass to a large sample of quasars for which line - width and continuum measures are available .    combining the results from the h@xmath1 , mgii  and civ  samples of sdss quasars",
    ", we found that the maximum mass of the active bh populations evolves as @xmath2 from @xmath37 to @xmath8 .",
    "it is noticeable that the dependence on redshift of the typical mass of active black hole populations is substantially unchanged from @xmath38 of the actual age of the universe to now , covering the region of maximum quasar activity ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "this is a clear manifestation of cosmic downsizing : the most massive black holes were more actively accreting early in the universe and with time progressively less massive ones dominate the population of agn .",
    "a comparison between the three emission lines studied in the work suggests some considerations on the corresponding blr properties .",
    "consistently with other independent indicators of the blr geometry ( considerations on the broad lines shape and from the geometrical factor @xmath40 ) , we suggest that the mgii  blr is essentially isotropic ( or rather geometrically thick ) and the doppler velocities are practically purely rotational , as the assumptions produce a high quality description of the data distribution in the fwhm ",
    "luminosity plane .",
    "consequently the mgii  line width is a good indicator of the virial velocity from which it is possible to infer the bh mass . on the other hand ,",
    "there is increasing evidence that the civ  line emitting region is disc - like and hence this line is representative of the virial velocity only if the blr is observed edge - on , i.e.  when the doppler effect ( which acts only on the velocity component parallel to the line of sight ) is maximum .",
    "the bh mass determinations from civ  are then subject to an intrinsic error due to the uncertainty on the inclination angle and then on the virial velocity of the clouds .",
    "the h@xmath1  line emitting region of the blr is found to be closer to the isotropic case than civ  one , but we suggest that for some objects the h@xmath1  clouds are not at the equilibrium and are dominated by turbulent motion .",
    "this indicates that the h@xmath1  emission line is a mediocre estimator of the blr virial velocity and that the bh mass estimates from h@xmath1  are subject to an uncertainty which is difficult to constrain .    in conclusion",
    ", we suggest that an inflated disc broad - line region , in which the carbon line is emitted in a flat inner disc while mgii  is produced in a geometrically thick outer region , can account for the observed differences in the fwhm distributions of the two emission lines .",
    "the h@xmath1  broad emission line would be produced in clouds at the same distance from the central source as the mgii  ones , but the role of radiation pressure may be more relevant , accounting for non virial motion of the gas .",
    "we then propose that the mgii  line and the corresponding 3000   monochromatic luminosity are preferable indicators of the blr virial velocity and size respectively , and hence of the bh mass through eq .",
