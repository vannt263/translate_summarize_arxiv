    "it is still premature to conclude that the recently discovered scalar particle with a mass of around 125 gev at the lhc @xcite is the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson . among other possibilities",
    ", it can very well be the lightest neutral higgs boson of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which is the most advocated beyond the sm scenario .",
    "be that as it may , stringent constraints apply on the supersymmetric parameter space , which are , at least for the minimal versions , more severe than those placed from the non - observation of superparticles from direct searches at the colliders . in spite of several advantages that supersymmetry offers , like the solution of the big hierarchy problem and even the provision of a cold dark matter candidate",
    ", we can not escape the following pertinent question : does supersymmetry even partially ease the existing tension between the sm predictions and the experimental measurements for some specific observables ?",
    "the tension with @xmath9 of muon , namely , @xmath19 , i.e. a 3.5@xmath10 deviation of the measured value @xcite from its sm expectation @xcite , is an old intriguing one .",
    "similarly , there is a longstanding @xmath20 discrepancy between the sm expectation and the experimental value for the @xmath21 forward - backward asymmetry @xmath22 measured on the @xmath3-peak @xcite .",
    "recently , a 1.2@xmath10 discrepancy , but with an opposite pull to that of @xmath22 , between the sm prediction and the experimental value for @xmath23 has been reported following the latest sm calculation taking electroweak two - loop plus order @xmath24 three - loop effects @xcite .",
    "although 1.2@xmath10 is not statistically too much significant , it is this opposite pull between @xmath5 and @xmath22 that we would like to exploit for discriminating supersymmetric models .",
    "possible ways to ease these hiccups in a model - independent effective theory approach and the corresponding lhc signatures have recently been discussed @xcite .",
    "but , what these tensions imply for supersymmetric models is the main concern of the present paper .    for definiteness",
    ", we will start with the parameter space of the constrained mssm , called cmssm , completely specified at the grand unification ( gut ) scale by a common scalar mass ( @xmath25 ) , a common gaugino mass @xmath26 , a universal scalar trilinear parameter ( @xmath27 ) , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets ( @xmath28 ) , and the sign of the higgsino mass parameter ( @xmath29 ) @xcite .",
    "we place indirect constraints on the cmssm parameter space from observables classified here under three categories :    1 .",
    "the lightest cp - even higgs mass @xmath1 gev , reaching out to which requires the stop squarks to be very heavy ( several tev ) or having a substantial mixing between their left and right components @xcite . since all superparticle masses are interrelated in terms of the @xmath30 gut scale parameters , the higgs mass puts by far the strongest constraint on the cmssm parameter space .",
    "2 .   a set of @xmath8-physics observables , namely , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the first two processes , being loop - induced in both sm and cmssm , put a strong constraint on the cmssm parameters from the fact that the data on them are quite precise and completely consistent with the sm expectations .",
    "the new physics parts for the remaining ones are mediated essentially by the charged higgs boson , and here the data show some intriguing discrepancy with the sm expectations .",
    "we include the measurement of @xmath9 of muon too in this category , which prefers the smuons and gaugino / higgsino to be light .",
    "3 .   the @xmath3-peak observables @xmath5 and @xmath11",
    ". both are precision electroweak observables , with a pull of 1.2@xmath10 and 2.5@xmath10 respectively , when experimental data are compared with their sm predictions .",
    "the supersymmetric contributions to these observables in the current context form the core of our analysis .",
    "constraints from the interplay of the first two categories listed above have already been placed by several authors @xcite .",
    "the main thrust of the present paper is to explore if it is possible to additionally satisfy the constraints listed in the third category .",
    "the electroweak precision data was analyzed vis -  - vis mssm in ref .",
    "@xcite , but at a time when the discrepancy between the measured value of @xmath5 and the sm one - loop estimate was only about @xmath35 , and the higgs boson was not discovered .",
    "so it is only proper to readdress the issue in the light of the present wisdom , especially when the higgs boson has finally been observed , and estimate of higher - order effects on @xmath5 has widened the discrepancy from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "also , the opposite pull between @xmath5 and @xmath11 should be paid due attention , as these are precision observables .",
    "we note that in cmssm the masses of the squarks and the charged higgs boson stem from a common @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , non - observation of squarks in direct searches automatically implies that the charged higgs boson has to be heavy .",
    "for this reason , for some of the @xmath8-physics observables where the charged higgs boson contributes as the sole new physics at tree level , its numerical impact is rather suppressed . to liberate the charged higgs boson from this unfavorable tie - up with the squarks",
    ", we consider a slightly wider variant , called the non - universal scalar model ( nusm ) , which is characterized by two different soft scalar masses at the gut scale : @xmath37 for the matter scalars which belong to a 16-plet , and @xmath38 for the higgs scalars which belong to a decuplet , of the underlying so(10 ) @xcite .",
    "note that even if there is a common scalar mass at the planck scale @xmath39 , the matter and higgs scalar masses at the gut scale @xmath40 can be different because of renormalization group running controlled by _ a priori _ unknown physics between @xmath39 and @xmath40 . from this perspective",
    ", one might take @xmath38 and @xmath37 as independent parameters . in this case ,",
    "non - observation of squarks does not necessarily imply that the charged higgs boson is heavy and @xmath41 . for nusm ,",
    "the weak scale parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 are not independent as at gut scale these two parameters are the same as @xmath44 . ] .",
    "still , the masses of the charged higgs boson and the squarks in nusm are not fully uncorrelated because of the radiative corrections to the higgs mass parameters coming from the stop squarks involving large yukawa couplings .",
    "even then , we observe that a lot of parameter space in the charged higgs mass plane which is disfavored in cmssm is resurrected in nusm .    in the last part of this paper , we will consider selected benchmark points of the 19-parameter phenomenological mssm ( pmssm ) @xcite , which is a subspace of pmssm with parameters defined at the weak scale , without introducing any theoretical prejudice about their high scale behaviors .",
    "24 such benchmark model points have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which correspond to different regions of the mssm parameter space , consistent with all other constraints like the higgs mass , dark matter relic density , and direct searches at the lhc . out of these 24 model points ,",
    "5 have been shortlisted in @xcite .",
    "we will analyse how these well - motivated benchmark points react to the combined effects of ( @xmath5@xmath12 ) and a few other observables .",

    "the loop corrections induced by the superparticles can be approximated as @xmath57 the expressions for the quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 have been adapted from appendix b of ref .",
    "they contain contributions from top - charged higgs , stop - chargino and sbottom - neutralino loops , expressed in terms of the passarino - veltman functions @xcite . the new contribution to @xmath5",
    "can be written as @xmath60 with @xmath61 \\approx \\xi \\left[-\\frac{60}{13 } f_l + \\frac{12}{13 } f_r\\right ] \\",

    "( [ rb - susy ] ) is shown only for illustration by approximating @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "_ however , this approximation is shown only for illustrative purpose_. the full expression in mssm can be found in @xcite which we have employed for our numerical analysis .. the gfitter group @xcite has recently updated the sm fit ( after the higgs discovery ) using the improved calculation of @xmath5 with the result that the discrepancy with the measured value is now 1.2@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the new situation is the following : @xmath64    the change in @xmath22 can similarly be written as @xmath65 \\approx -\\frac{5}{13}\\xi \\left[f_l +    5 f_r\\right]\\ , , \\label{afb - susy}\\ ] ] for which a @xmath20 discrepancy between the sm and experimental values is known to exist for a while @xcite : @xmath66    a comparative study of @xmath5 and @xmath22 is now in order .",
    "it is not difficult to understand the tension between their supersymmetric contributions irrespective of any other constraints . in mssm ( i.e. not just in cmssm ) , both @xmath58 and @xmath59 turn out to be negative , with @xmath67 , because of the presence of the numerically dominant stop - chargino loop contribution for @xmath58 , which is absent for @xmath59 .",
    "thus , one can have a consistent solution for @xmath5 , as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ rb - susy ] ) and ( [ rb - data ] ) . on the other hand , as eq .",
    "( [ afb - susy ] ) shows , the supersymmetric contribution to @xmath22 is always positive , while according to eq .",
    "( [ afb - data ] ) experimental data prefers a negative contribution .",
    "thus , not only cmssm but a large class of supersymmetric model for which @xmath68 and @xmath67 can not simultaneously satisfy @xmath5 and @xmath22 .    to numerically appreciate the combined effects of @xmath5 and @xmath69 ,",
    "we first define what is known as ` pull ' for a given observable ( @xmath70 ) , as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the experimental central value and @xmath73 is one standard deviation experimental error .",
    "then we introduce a quantity @xmath74 defined as @xmath75 eqs .",
    "( [ rb - data ] ) and ( [ afb - data ] ) tell us that the pulls of @xmath5 and @xmath11 are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively , so that @xmath78 .",
    "light superparticles can improve the agreement in @xmath5 , but any such contributions can only worsen the tension in @xmath22 , as explained earlier . thus @xmath74 can not be smaller than @xmath77 .",
    "this motivates us to look for the parameter space where @xmath74 lies between 2.5 and its sm value 2.8 ( which corresponds to completely decoupled supersymmetry ) . for illustration ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath79 and 2.7 as two representative values , in the sense that for each case we accept the parameter space which yields @xmath74 less than that value .",
    "we recall in this context that although @xmath5 and @xmath11 both depend on the dynamics of the @xmath47 vertex , the former is a ratio of decay widths and the latter is an asymmetry , and they are experimentally independent observables .",
    "hence , @xmath74 is a good measure of the combined tension produced by these two observables .",
    "the model parameters have been scanned in the following range : @xmath80 , @xmath81 ( all in tev ) , @xmath82 .",
    "for the nusm scenario , we scan over the additional parameter @xmath38 in the range of [ 0:2 ] tev .",

    "the region which agrees with @xmath5 within 1@xmath10 is shown by blue dashed lines .",
    "while one might argue that a discrepancy of @xmath36 is not of much significance , we observe that softening the same to even @xmath91 requires such light sparticles , in particular the stop squarks , as to be untenable with the higgs mass constraint .",
    "we also show regions which admit @xmath94 ( red or dark grey ) and @xmath93 ( green or light grey ) .",
    "we reiterate that the 2.5@xmath10 pull in @xmath11 essentially controls the constraint from @xmath74 .",
    "_ in the right panel",
    "( b ) _ , we focus on the zone where constraints from several @xmath8-physics observables , as well as the region allowed by @xmath9 of muon , are prominent . wherever a single line is drawn for a particular observable , the space above that line is allowed from the corresponding constraint .",
    "we make a cautionary remark that these lines separate allowed and disallowed regions where all cmssm input parameters are marginalized .",
    "admittedly , we have not tried to simultaneously fit all the electroweak observables , however , with such large values of the sparticle masses , it is only natural to expect that the observables already consistent with the sm would not suffer any untenable tension .",
    "the zone allowed by @xmath9 of muon is shown by yellow patch . the dominant contribution to @xmath9 of muon",
    "comes when the bino and smuons floating inside the loops are light @xcite .",
    "we have kept the lightest higgs boson mass at a conservative value of 123 gev , allowing for the possibility that higher order radiative corrections may contribute a further 2 to 3 gev ( setting @xmath95 gev would result in even tighter constraints ) .",
    "even then , this rules out more region in the @xmath96 versus @xmath28 plane than the other constraints .",
    "the reason is that one requires stop masses as heavy as several tev and a substantial mixing in the stop mass - squared matrix to yield such a higgs mass @xcite . among the flavor observables",
    ", @xmath83 usually provides the strongest constraint @xcite , because it directly constrains the chargino mass which sits in the lower end of the cmssm spectrum .",
    "the constraint gets more stringent at large @xmath28 because the dominant chargino - stop loop amplitude grows as @xmath97 .",
    "the supersymmetric contribution to the branching ratio of @xmath98 grows as @xmath99 @xcite , and therefore at large @xmath28 the constraint is more stringent . as regards the process @xmath100 , the dominant new physics contribution comes from tree - level charged higgs mediation , and for very large @xmath28 provides a stronger constraint than @xmath101 .",
    "the constraint essentially applies on the ratio @xmath102 , which is a general feature of any two - higgs doublet model @xcite .     of muon , the combined @xmath8-physics data , and the requirement of satisfying @xmath92 .",

    "we show the impact of the combined constraints coming from the higgs mass , @xmath8-physics observables , @xmath9 of muon , and @xmath74 .",
    "constraints from the higgs mass are similar in the two cases in spite of the fact that in nusm the charged higgs mass has its origin in @xmath38 while the squark masses are unified at a different value @xmath37 .",
    "the reason can be traced to the weak scale sum rule that holds in both cases , namely , @xmath103 , where @xmath41 is the cp - odd higgs mass . in both cases ,",
    "the satisfaction of @xmath104 gev requires @xmath41 to be very large ( the ` decoupling ' limit ) .",
    "a crucial observation is that unlike in cmssm there is a small region in nusm which satisfies both @xmath94 and the higgs mass constraint .",
    "we now comment on how the requirement of @xmath74 being less than some representative value is transmitted to an upper limit on the charged higgs mass .",
    "this upper limit comes from the fact that the masses of the charged higgs and the stop squarks , both floating in independent triangle loops of the effective @xmath47 vertex , are intimately related through @xmath25 and @xmath105 . for moderate @xmath28 ,",
    "one gets @xmath106 , while it is somewhat reduced for large @xmath28 due to negative contribution from bottom and tau yukawa couplings .",
    "the squark masses of the first two generations are well approximated as @xmath107 . for the third generation",
    "the expressions are somewhat involved due to large mixing in the squared mass matrix , with the result that one eigenvalue is lighter than any of the first two generation squark masses .",
    "the charged higgs loop contribution to @xmath5 is numerically sub - dominant compared to the stop loop .",
    "the limit from @xmath5 or @xmath11 , i.e. from @xmath74 , effectively applies on the stop mass , which is then translated to the charged higgs mass .",
    "for nusm , the situation is different as the masses of the charged higgs and the stop squarks stem from different parameters , @xmath38 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "still , an upper limit on the charged higgs mass arises , though it is much weaker than in cmssm .",
    "the reason is that in nusm the charged higgs mass and the squark masses are not _ completely _ independent .",
    "as mentioned earlier , though @xmath108 and @xmath109 originate from the same @xmath38 at high scale , their splitting at the weak scale following renormalization group running picks up the squark mass dependence ( essentially of the third generation ) .",
    "so , beyond a certain charged higgs mass , the stop squarks become too heavy to leave any impact on @xmath74 .",
    "this is how an upper limit is placed on the charged higgs mass in nusm , though it is weaker than in cmssm .",
    "we now make some remarks on the impact of the observables @xmath110 and @xmath111 , defined as @xmath112 , with @xmath113 .",
    "these ratios have recently been measured by the babar collaboration @xcite : @xmath114 which are @xmath115 and @xmath116 away from their sm estimates , respectively .",
    "like @xmath117 , the supersymmetric contributions to these processes are completely dominated by tree - level charged higgs exchange . as has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , consistency with @xmath110 and @xmath118 requires @xmath102 to be @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively , ruling out any _ otherwise allowed _ value of @xmath102 at 99.8% confidence level .",
    "this conclusion would hold not only in cmssm or nusm but in any supersymmetric model having a single charged higgs .",
    "a comment on constraints from dark matter , which we have not included in our numerical analysis , is now in order .",
    "corners in cmssm and nuhm parameter spaces which contain points that satisfy both @xmath121 125 gev and the dark matter constraints have been explored , and one such benchmark point for cmssm parameters which satisfies lhc 2012 plus xenon100 dark matter data is : @xmath122 ( all in gev ) , and @xmath123 @xcite . however",

    "the fit improves considerably if one considers only the canonical set excluding the muon @xmath9 .",

    "we now conclude with the following observations .",
    "if the 125 gev scalar resonance discovered at the lhc be after all the lightest cp - even higgs boson of minimal supersymmetry , in particular of the cmssm or nusm variety , then accommodating all the _ three types _ of observables simultaneously becomes extremely difficult . as mentioned earlier ,",
