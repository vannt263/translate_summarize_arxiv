    "the purpose of the lipschitz truncation is to regularize a given function by a lipschitz continuous one by changing it only on a small _ bad _ set .",
    "it is crucial for the applications that the function is not changed globally , which rules out the possibility of convolutions .",
    "the lipschitz truncation technique was introduced by acerbi - fusco  @xcite to show lower semi - continuity of certain variational integrals .    since",
    "then this technique has been successfully applied in many different areas .",
    "let us provide a few examples .",
    "the lipschitz truncation was used in the context of biting lemmas , existence theory and regularity results of non - linear elliptic pde for example in  @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was also successfully applied in the framework of non - newtonian fluids of power law type  @xcite and even in the context of numerical analysis  @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the lipschitz truncation was used to develop an existence theory of vector valued very weak solutions of elliptic pdes .",
    "all of these application have in common that the desired test functions are a  priori not admissible , but have to be approximated by lipschitz functions . in order to preserve things like pointwise monotonicity of the system , it is important that the truncation takes place only on the small bad set .",
    "the bad set is usually defined in terms of the level sets of the maximal operator of the gradients .    during these years",
    "the lipschitz truncation technique has been refined with respect to several aspects . in the stationary situation",
    "the picture is almost complete .",
    "it is now possible to preserve zero boundary value , obtain stability in all  @xmath1-spaces and to apply the technique to sequences of functions .",
    "moreover , the lipschitz truncation can be interpreted as a -zygmund decomposition in the sobolev spaces of first order , see  @xcite .    in the parabolic context",
    "the theory is much less developed .",
    "the parabolic lipschitz truncation was introduced by kinnunen - lewis @xcite .",
    "they used it to prove higher integrability for very weak solutions of the evolutive @xmath0-laplacian systems . on the other hand",
    ", diening - ruzicka - wolf  @xcite developed a parabolic lipschitz truncation to show existence of fluids of power law type ; i.e. the evolutive analogue to @xcite . in @xcite a parabolic lipschitz truncation was developed , which preserves the solenoidal structure of the given function and makes the truncation more suitable for problems from fluids dynamics .",
    "the difficulty of the parabolic lipschitz truncation in contrast to the stationary case is due to the fact , that the time - derivative of the solution is only defined in terms of negative sobolev spaces or in the distributional sense .",
    "therefore , the parabolic lipschitz truncations mentioned above lacked the possibility to preserve zero boundary values and to obtain control on the time derivative of the truncation . in this paper",
    "we will overcome both of these problems .    in what follows we will introduce our parabolic lipschitz truncation in the setting of @xmath0-growth assumptions .",
    "the full statement that holds for general orlicz growth assumptions can be found in theorem  [ thm : orlicz ] in the next section .",
    "our standing assumption for the lipschitz truncation , is that the given function @xmath2 has a time derivative in the following sense : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a time interval and @xmath5 is a bounded domain in @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",

    "first , our assumptions are weaker : we only assume and we deduce the validity of a poincar inequality .",
    "second , our proof is directly and completely avoids any argument by contradiction .",
    "this direct approach via the parabolic lipschitz truncations gives us a much finer control on the quantities and allows us to show closeness both in @xmath58 and @xmath59 norms , ( the last closeness is via the natural quantity @xmath52 ) .",
    "in addition the previous estimate measures the closeness of the time derivatives and spatial gradients in a quantitative way .",
    "third , we can preserve boundary values , which is very handy for applications .    as mentioned above",
    ", the direct proof of harmonic and caloric approximation lemmas by means of the lipschitz truncation has many advantages .",
    "recently , the solenoidal parabolic lipschitz truncation of  @xcite was used in  @xcite to derive an caloric approximation lemma for the linear , parabolic @xmath60-stokes problem , which is useful in fluid mechanics .",
