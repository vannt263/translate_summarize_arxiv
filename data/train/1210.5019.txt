    "the other is the discrete behavior of the electric charge and is known as shot noise @xcite . from measures of shot noise ( @xmath12 ) and electrical current ( @xmath13 ) can be obtained information that usually is not found in conductance measures as the effective electric charge , by means of the ratio between @xmath12 and @xmath13 called fano factor ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "the shot noise in superconducting systems has attracted attention due to the possibility to obtain effective electric charge equal to @xmath8 , this has been analyzed for plain junctions and non - isotropic superconductors @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the shot noise has not been studied in a high tc superconductor connected to a quantum point contact , where the differential conductance and the other properties are affected by the size of the electrode .",

    "additionally , the recent discovery of high - tc superconductivity in ferropnictides @xcite has stimulated experimental and theoretical studies of these new superconductors .",
    "the main feature of these systems is their multiple band structure near of the fermi level . in a simplified scheme , the structure",
    "is reduced to two band model , where the symmetry of the pair potential in each band could be different , and experimental evidence has been favorable to the @xmath5 or @xmath4 symmetries @xcite .    in the present work",

    "one method used to determine the transport properties in superconducting junctions , is the hamiltonian approach @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this approach is to write a hamiltonian that describes every region involved in the junction and a coupling term between those regions , which gives information about the probability of one particle crossing from one region to other .",
    "the hamiltonian approach allows us to determine the transport properties using the non - equilibrium green functions of the system cuevas .",
    "we consider a semi - infinite superconductor ( @xmath17-region ) connected to one normal metal lead ( @xmath18 region ) .",
    "our aim is to find the electrical current , the shot noise and the fano factor when a voltage @xmath19 is applied between the lead and the superconducting region . for @xmath15 wave superconductors ,",

    ", we use the spectral density of the electrical current fluctuations , and taking into account the current expression , we obtain a similar equation for the shot noise ( [ shot noise ] ) . at zero temperature , non zero voltage and zero frequency , ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 )",

    "we obtain the green function for a one dimensional electrode coupled to a superconductor by    @xmath58    this green function ( @xmath59 ) is affected by the anisotropy of the superconductor pair potential and depends on the thickness for the contact . as we consider a contact that has only one transmission mode , the thickness of the lead satisfies the ratio @xmath60 and then @xmath61 is proportional to the wave number on @xmath62 direction ( @xmath63 ) and to the overlapping between the wave functions on @xmath25 direction , @xmath64 @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have fixed @xmath65 and the ratio @xmath66 , which are typical values for a htcs .    for voltages @xmath67 , general expressions that describes the contribution to the electrical current and the shot noise due to andreev reflections ( ar )",

    "the electric effective charge tends to @xmath7 . for @xmath1 symmetry",
    "the andreev reflection is suppressed and it does not exist effective charge related with ar . therefore the electrical current and the shot noise are produced only by quasiparticle transmission , for this reason the @xmath14 is equal to @xmath77 for every voltage ( fig .",
