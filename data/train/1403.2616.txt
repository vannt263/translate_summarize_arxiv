    "one is often led to distinguish `` more tractable '' measures , e.g. , those that have better hyperbolicity properties . indeed , some natural constructions will only work for those `` better measure '' .",

    "hofbauer @xcite built a partial borel isomorphism ( following prior work of takahashi @xcite ) and showed that the discarded set had zero measure for all ergodic invariant probability measures with nonzero entropy .",
    "hofbauer then used this isomorphism to analyze entropy maximizing measures and showed that whenever the topological entropy of the interval map is nonzero , then there are only finitely many ergodic entropy maximizing measures ( and exactly one for maps with a single critical point ) .",

    "entropy do not have the `` right '' properties ( for instance their support is contained in hypersurfaces ) .",

    "conditions ( a0)-(a3 ) are again easily checked . the resulting notion of partial borel isomorphism",

    "<S> these lectures focus on a recent result of mike hochman : an arbitrary standard borel system can be embedded into a mixing markov with equal entropy , respecting _ all invariant probability measures _ , with two exceptions : those carried by periodic orbits and those with maximal entropy . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the corresponding notions of almost borel embedding and isomorphism and universality .    </S>",
    "<S> the main part of this paper is devoted to a self - contained and detailed proof of hochman s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> we then explain how katok s horseshoe theorem can be used to analyze diffeomorphisms with `` enough '' measures that are hyperbolic in the sense of pesin theory , in both mixing and non - mixing situations . in the latter setting , new invariants generalizing the measures maximizing the entropy emerge . </S>"
