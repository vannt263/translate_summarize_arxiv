    "since langevin s early investigations @xcite , the motion of mesoscopic particles has been studied by equations basically of the newtonian type , supplemented by random stochastic force terms .",
    "through well - known and straightforward formalisms , these `` langevin equations '' are connected to the continuum descriptions of the fokker - planck type @xcite .",
    "the latter give access to the corresponding stochastic distribution functions , stationary or time - dependent .",
    "in the simplest set - up within this framework , the velocity component of a one - dimensional stochastic motion is investigated @xcite . here , we consider the second - simplest example .",
    "that is , we include both the velocity and spatial component of the one - dimensional motion of a single particle @xcite .",

    "an example of the latter type forms the subject of this paper .    more precisely , we refer to frictional forces of the coulombic type @xcite .",
    "they form a very basic example of nonlinear frictional behavior , in contrast to conventional linear viscous frictional forces . only very recently have they been included into the stochastic characterization of the langevin and fokker - planck type by de gennes @xcite , who studied the dry friction between two solids , and kawarada and hayakawa @xcite , who were interested in the statistics of vibrating granular media . in both studies ,",
    "the authors consider only the velocity component .",
    "the same is true for a more formal study using the path integral formalism @xcite .",
    "examples of studies in which the impact of coulombic frictional forces on the spatial displacement statistics is taken into account are even rarer .",
    "so far , such investigations have been performed numerically in the context of contact line motion of water droplets on vibrating solid substrates @xcite and of stick - slip motions of solid particles on vibrating substrates @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present results of further analytical considerations of the underlying equations .",
    "we find that the velocity - dependent part of the corresponding fokker - planck equation is formally connected to the schrdinger equation for the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator in the presence of a delta potential .",
    "the spatial distribution function is then obtained by numerically solving the corresponding brinkman hierarchy @xcite .",

    "a direct numerical integration of the fokker - planck equation in time reveals a crossover from a subsequent exponential to a gaussian spatial distribution function , as shown in section [ numerical ] .",
    "the exponential tails in the spatial distribution function result from the influence of the coulombic friction . this has been found before , using a less direct way of numerical calculation @xcite compared to the one applied here .",
    "we show that a data collapse of the resulting spatial distribution curves at different times is not possible by a simple rescaling procedure . taking into account higher moments of the spatial distribution function ,",
    "we identify an intermediate regime of multiscaling .",

    "( [ flucdiss ] ) marks an upper limit for the strength of the stochastic force @xmath11 in a system at thermal equilibrium ( see the appendix ) . on the other hand",
    ", the value @xmath32 corresponds to its value in the absence of coulombic friction . within the narrow window accessible to the direct numerical calculations ,",
    "both of these two scenarios lead to qualitatively identical results .",
    "the effect of coulombic frictional forces in stochastic equations of motion formed the central topic of this paper .",
    "we have mainly studied the statistical properties of the spatial distribution functions resulting from the related fokker - planck equation .    as a first step ,",
    "we have revealed the connection of the underlying equation to the case of a quantum mechanical oscillator in the presence of a pinning delta - potential .",
    "this allowed us to derive the coefficients in the corresponding brinkman hierarchy .",
    "the latter then offers the possibility of numerically calculating the spatial distribution functions in an approximate but time - efficient way .",
    "in addition , we numerically integrated the fokker - planck equation forward in time directly .",
    "we have found exponential tails in the spatial distribution functions that move out of the observation window with increasing time . in the intermediate time regime , where these exponential tails are present , effective",
    "multiscaling has been detected for the spatial distribution functions .",
    "the data collapse through a simple rescaling procedure fails .",
    "this becomes more evident when the time dependence of the different moments of the distribution is inspected and contrasted with the purely gaussian case .",
    "such a procedure serves to identify the regime where coulombic friction dominates , and a crossover time can be extracted .",
    "finally , we have discussed the possibility of observing the influence of coulombic friction during experiments on diffusive motions .",
    "our central conclusion is that it is important to determine and analyze the behavior of the higher order moments of the experimental distribution functions to learn more about the underlying physical processes .",
    "after this work had been completed , a related manuscript appeared @xcite .",
    "the authors of this manuscript also find the eigenfunctions to eq .",
    "( [ langevinv ] ) and present details on the analysis of the corresponding spectra .",
    "a spatial component corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ langevinx ] ) , however , is not taken into account in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we thank bo wang and steve granick for stimulating discussions on their experiments at the beginning of this study .",
    "support of this work by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through a research fellowship ( a.m.m . ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss the issue of deriving a fluctuation dissipation relation for a system in thermal equilibrium that obeys the langevin equations ( [ langevinv ] ) and ( [ langevinx ] ) , or the corresponding fokker - planck equation ( [ fp ] ) . in other words , we are looking for an expression for the strength of the stochastic force @xmath11 as a function of the friction parameters ( we restrict ourselves to constant values of @xmath11 in this study ) .",
    "for that purpose it is sufficient to concentrate on the velocity dependent part of the equations .",
    "then the only degree of freedom in the model is the velocity of the particle @xmath52 .      performing the ensemble average using the stationary velocity distribution function @xmath30 from eq .",
    "( [ fst ] ) , we obtain the condition @xmath148 this relation is satisfied , if the hamiltonian reads @xmath149    at this point , we must note that @xmath150 does not correspond to the kinetic energy of the particle itself , although @xmath52 describes its velocity .",
    "( [ langevinv])-([fp ] ) and ( [ h ] ) must rather be interpreted as effective phenomenological equations for one single remaining degree of freedom @xmath52 .",
    "`` effective '' here means that all the other degrees of freedom that are present in more microscopic characterizations and describe the energetic state of the environment of the particle have been integrated out . the energetic effect on the environment due to frictional interactions ,",
    "however , is expressed as a function of the magnitude of @xmath52 and enters into expression ( [ h ] ) .    in the viscous case of a freely moving brownian particle ( @xmath28 ) , the hamiltonian @xmath150 is set equal to the kinetic energy of the particle . from eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) we then find the usual textbook example @xmath32 ( or @xmath151 , if we do not scale out the viscous relaxation time @xmath6 ) @xcite . here , since deriving microscopic models is beyond the scope of this study , we do not know the value of the proportionality constant @xmath11 .",
    "what we do know on physical grounds is that the mean kinetic energy of the particle itself , @xmath152 , in a passive system can not be larger in the presence of coulombic friction than without it : @xmath153 performing the ensemble average , again using @xmath30 from eq .",
    "( [ fst ] ) , leads to the fluctuation dissipation relation ( [ flucdiss ] ) and thus sets an upper limit for the strength of the driving stochastic force @xmath11 ."
