    "charm physics plays a unique dual role in the modern investigation of flavor physics .",
    "charm decay and production experiments provide valuable checks and supporting measurements for studies of cp - violation in measurements of ckm parameters in b - physics , as well as outstanding opportunities for searches for new physics .",
    "historically , many methods of heavy quark physics have been first tested in charmed hadrons .",
    "the fact that a b - quark mainly decays into a charm quark makes charm physics an integral part of any b - physics program . as we shall see in many cases ,",
    "direct measurements of charm decay parameters directly affect the studies of fundamental physics in b decays .",
    "any search for new physics falls into two distinct categories : _ direct _ , when new physics particles are directly produced in the experiment and _ indirect _ , when they only affect low energy observables via quantum corrections . in turn",
    ", indirect searches can also be roughly divided into three classes , depending on which observables or processes are used in the search : 1 ) processes forbidden in the standard model ( sm ) , i.e. absent at any order in expansion in any of the coupling constants of sm .",
    "an example of those could be provided by charge - violating transitions @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "2 ) processes forbidden in the standard model at tree level , but possible at higher orders . examples of those processes involve flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions , such as familiar @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5/@xmath6 mixing .",
    "3 ) processes allowed in the standard model . examples of the tests that belong to this category include examinations of the relations between different observables that are satisfied in the standard model , but not necessary in general .",
    "an example of those are the triangle relations among ckm parameters extracted form several different decays .",
    "the standard model is a very constrained system , which implements a remarkably simple and economic description of all cp - violating processes in the flavor sector by a single cp - violating parameter , the phase of the ckm matrix .",
    "this fact relates all cp - violating observables in bottom , charm and strange systems and provides an excellent opportunity for searches of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "one of the major goals of the contemporary experimental @xmath7 physics program is an accurate determination of the ckm parameters . as we shall see below",
    ", inputs from charm decays are important ingredient in this program , both in the extraction of the angles and sides of the ckm unitarity triangle .",
    "some of the cleanest methods of the determination of the ckm phase @xmath9 $ ] involve the interference of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 quark - level transitions  @xcite . a way to arrange for an interference of those seemingly different processes",
    "was first pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "it involves interference of two _ hadronic _ decays @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being any common final state for @xmath15 and @xmath16 decays . since then , many different methods have been proposed , mainly differing by the @xmath17 final state and paths of reaching it : a combination of the cabibbo - favored ( cf ) and doubly - cabibbo suppressed decays ( dcsd ) @xmath18",
    "@xcite , singly - cabibbo suppressed decays ( scsd ) @xmath19  @xcite , cabibbo - favored decays employing large @xmath20 mixing @xmath21  @xcite , as well as multibody versions of these transitions  @xcite . for similar methods involving interference of the _ initial _ state , see  @xcite .",
    "each of those methods involve observations of several @xmath7 decay modes , so all of the hadronic unknowns , such as the ratio [ bdratio ] a(b^+ d^0 k^+)/a(b^+ k^+)=r_b e^i ( + _ b ) , or @xmath22 , as well as @xmath8 , can be determined from the @xmath7-decay measurements only .",
    "yet , all of those methods will benefit from the separately performed charm decay measurements , the primary reason being the need for large statistics in any experimental determination of @xmath8 .",
    "for example , an ads method  @xcite employs a ratio of a dcs to cf decays @xmath23 .",
    "the accuracy of this method will be greatly improved if @xmath24 and @xmath25 are measured separately . while the separate measurement of @xmath24 is already available ,",
    "determination of @xmath25 will became possible at the upcoming tau - charm factories ( tcf ) at cornell ( cleo - c ) and beijing ( bes - iii ) .",
    "the basic idea is to make use of an important experimental advantage of tcf : operation at the @xmath26 threshold , where the @xmath15 and @xmath16 are produced in the quantum - mechanically coherent initial state  @xcite .",
    "since the initial @xmath26 state is prepared as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the relative angular momentum of two @xmath29 mesons , @xmath0 properties of the final states produced in the decay of @xmath30 are anti - correlated , one @xmath29 state decayed into the final state with definite @xmath0 properties immediately identifies or tags @xmath0 properties of the state `` on the other side . ''",
    "that is to say , if one state decayed into , say @xmath31 with @xmath32 , the other state is `` cp - tagged '' as being in the @xmath33 state .",
    "this allows one to measure @xmath34 . in order to see this ,",
    "let us write a triangle relation , @xmath35 which follows from the fact that , in the absence of cp - violation in charm , mass eigenstates of the neutral @xmath29 meson coincide with its cp - eigenstates , [ cpeig ] | d_= | d^0 | .",
    "this implies a relation for the branching ratios , @xmath36 where we used the fact that @xmath37 and neglected @xmath0 violation in mixing , which could undermine the cp - tagging procedure by splitting the cp - tagged state on one side into a linear combination of cp - even and cp - odd states .",
    "its effect , however , is completely negligible here .",
    "now , if both decays of @xmath38 and @xmath39 are measured , @xmath34 can be obtained from the asymmetry @xmath40 both eqs .",
    "( [ cos1 ] ) and ( [ cos2 ] ) can be used to extract @xmath25 at tcf .",
    "similar measurements are possible for other @xmath29 decays  @xcite .",
    "in addition , some methods require cross - checks in the charm sector that might restrict the accuracy of these methods . a good example is provided by the original gw method  @xcite , which does not take into account the possibility of relatively large @xmath6 mixing  @xcite .",
    "this method relies on the simple triangle amplitude relation @xmath41 , again provided by eq .",
    "( [ cpeig ] ) .",
    "an amplitude @xmath42 is measured with @xmath29 decaying to a particular cp - eigenstate .",
    "neglecting @xmath6 mixing , angle @xmath8 can then be extracted , up to a discrete ambiguity , from the measurements of @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in particular , 1 + r_b^2 + 2 r_b c",
    "_ , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are defined from the ratio eq .",
    "( [ bdratio ] ) . then , ^2 = .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath6 mixing , if not properly accounted for , can affect the results of this analysis . indeed , taking @xmath6 mixing into account results in the modification of the definitions of @xmath48 , c_&&(_b ) 2_d + & - & , where @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 being the masses and widths of d - meson mass eigenstates @xmath52 , @xmath53 is a cp - parity of @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is a cp - violating phase of @xmath6 mixing .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath56 can impact the determination of @xmath8 from these modes .",
    "thus , separately constraining @xmath6 mixing parameters will be helpful .",
    "we shall discuss those later .",
    "there are several unitarity triangles that involve charm inputs  @xcite . since all cp - violating effects in the flavor sector of the sm are related to the single phase of the ckm matrix , all of the ckm unitarity triangles , including the ones with most charm inputs , have the same area .",
    "this could provides a non - trivial check of the standard model , if measurements of all sides of these triangles are measured with sufficient accuracy .",
    "unfortunately , `` charm triangles '' are `` squashed '' , with one side being much shorter then the other two .",
    "for example , in terms of the wolfenstein parameter @xmath57 , the relation @xmath58 has one side @xmath59 with the other two being @xmath60 , while the relations @xmath61 and @xmath62 have one side @xmath63 with the other two being @xmath64 .",
    "even though the second relation could provide an interesting information about the top quark ckm parameters and the last one can be checked using only the tree - level transitions , it is unlikely that the required accuracy will be achieved in the near future .",
    "in addition , tests similar to the `` first row unitarity '' , @xmath65 ( which at the moment fails at the level of @xmath66  @xcite ) are possible . for example , @xmath67 , it could provide an interesting cross - check on the value of @xmath68 extracted in b - decays , if sufficient accuracy on the experimental measurement of @xmath69 and @xmath70 is achieved .      since @xmath71 , both charm and bottom quarks can be regarded as heavy quarks .",
    "naturally , heavy quark symmetry relates observables in b and d transitions . as an example , let us consider measurements in the charm sector affect determinations of the ckm matrix elements relevant to top quark in @xmath5 mixing .",
    "a mass difference of mass eigenstates in @xmath5 system can be written as [ offdiag ] m_d = ^-6/23 |b_d^0|o()|b_d^0 , where @xmath72 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for complete definitions of the parameters in this expression ) .",
    "the largest uncertainty of about 30% in the theoretical calculation is introduced by the poorly known hadronic matrix element @xmath73 .",
    "evaluation of this matrix element is a genuine non - perturbative task , which can be approached with several different techniques .",
    "the simplest approach ( `` factorization '' ) reduces the matrix element @xmath74 to the product of matrix elements measured in leptonic @xmath7 decays @xmath75 @xmath76 , where we employed the definition of the decay constant @xmath77 , 0||b_l _",
    "d_l|b^0(*p*)= i p_f_b/2 . a deviation from the factorization ansatz is usually described by the parameter @xmath78 defined as @xmath79 ; in factorization @xmath80 .",
    "similar considerations lead to an introduction of the parameter @xmath81 defined for mixing of @xmath82 mesons .",
    "it is important to note that the parameters @xmath83 depend on the chosen renormalization scale and scheme .",
    "it is convenient to introduce renormalization - group invariant parameters @xmath84 [ bhat ] b_b_q = ^-6/23 b_b_q .",
    "we provide averages of @xmath84 , as well as the ratio @xmath85 from the review  @xcite as well as from two more recent evaluations  @xcite in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "thus , at least naively , one can determine ckm matrix element @xmath86 by measuring @xmath77 and @xmath87 and computing @xmath83 .",
    "this direct approach , however , meets several difficulties .",
    "first , leptonic decay constant @xmath77 can in principle be extracted from leptonic decays of charged b mesons .",
    "the corresponding decay width is ( b l ) = f_b^2 |v_ub|^2 m_l^2 m_b ( 1- ) .",
    "this width is seen to be quite small due to the smallness of the ckm factor @xmath88 and helicity suppression factor of @xmath89 .",
    "in addition , experimental difficulties are also expected due to the backgrounds stemming from the presence of a neutrino in the final state .",
    ".[table1 ] renormalization - group independent b - parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     second , computation of @xmath83 is quite difficult and requires the use of non - perturbative techniques such as lattice or qcd sum rules .",
    "current uncertainties in the determinations of @xmath77 and @xmath83 are quite large .",
    "it turns out that evaluation of the ratio of = ^2 ||^2 , is favored by lattice community , as many systematic errors cancel in this ratio .",
    "this gives a ratio of @xmath90 , which provides a non - trivial constraint on ckm parameters in the @xmath91 plane .",
    "instead , one can make use of ample statistics available in charm production experiments , as heavy quark and @xmath92 flavor symmetries relate the ratio of charm decay constants @xmath93 to beauty decay constants @xmath94 = 1+o(m_s)(1/m_b-1/m_c ) .",
    "note that su(3)-violating corrections can also be evaluated in chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "one still needs to rely on the theoretical determination of @xmath83 .",
    "similar techniques of relating @xmath7 and @xmath29 decays can also be used to extract other ckm matrix elements , like @xmath95  @xcite , studies of lifetime patterns of heavy hadrons  @xcite , and tuning lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "another area of modern phenomenology where charm decays play an important role is the indirect search for physics beyond the standard model . indeed , large statistics usually available in charm physics experiment makes it possible to probe small effects that might be generated by the presence of new physics particles and interactions .",
    "a program of searches for new physics in charm is complimentary to the corresponding programs in bottom or strange systems .",
    "this is in part due to the fact loop - dominated processes such as @xmath6 mixing or flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decays are sensitive to the dynamics of ultra - heavy _ down - type particles_. also , in many dynamical models , including the standard model , the effects in @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 systems are correlated .    the low energy effect of new physics particles can be naturally written in terms of a series of local operators of increasing dimension generating @xmath99 ( decays ) or @xmath100 ( mixing ) transitions . for @xmath6 mixing these operators , as well as",
    "the one loop standard model effects , generate contributions to the effective operators that change @xmath15 state into @xmath16 state leading to the mass eigenstates @xmath101 where the complex parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 are obtained from diagonalizing the @xmath104 mass matrix .",
    "the mass and width splittings between these eigenstates are given in eq .",
    "( [ definition ] ) .",
    "it is known experimentally that @xmath6 mixing proceeds extremely slowly , which in the standard model is usually attributed to the absence of superheavy quarks destroying gim cancellations  @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to see how new physics can affect charm mixing . since the lifetime difference @xmath105",
    "is constructed from the decays of @xmath29 into physical states , it should be dominated by the standard model contributions , unless new physics significantly modifies @xmath106 interactions . on the contrary ,",
    "the mass difference @xmath107 can receive contributions from all energy scales .",
    "thus , it is usually conjectured that new physics can significantly modify @xmath107 leading to the inequality @xmath108  , of the order of a percent , is observed  @xcite . ] .",
    "the same considerations apply to fcnc decays as well , where new physics could possibly contribute to the decay rates of @xmath109 ( with @xmath110 being exclusive or inclusive final state ) as well as other observables  @xcite .",
    "one technical problem here is that in the standard model these decays are overwhelmingly dominated by long - distance effects , which makes them extremely difficult to predict model - independently .",
    "this problem can be turned into a virtue  @xcite .",
    "another possible manifestation of new physics interactions in the charm system is associated with the observation of ( large ) cp - violation .",
    "this is due to the fact that all quarks that build up the hadronic states in weak decays of charm mesons belong to the first two generations .",
    "since @xmath111 cabbibo quark mixing matrix is real , no cp - violation is possible in the dominant tree - level diagrams that describe the decay amplitudes . in the standard model",
    "cp - violating amplitudes can be introduced by including penguin or box operators induced by virtual @xmath98-quarks . however , their contributions are strongly suppressed by the small combination of ckm matrix elements @xmath112 .",
    "it is thus widely believed that the observation of ( large ) cp violation in charm decays or mixing would be an unambiguous sign for new physics .",
    "this fact makes charm decays a valuable tool in searching for new physics , since the statistics available in charm physics experiment is usually quite large .    as in b - physics ,",
    "cp - violating contributions in charm can be generally classified by three different categories : ( i ) cp violation in the decay amplitudes .",
    "this type of cp violation occurs when the absolute value of the decay amplitude for @xmath29 to decay to a final state @xmath14 ( @xmath113 ) is different from the one of corresponding cp - conjugated amplitude ( `` direct cp - violation '' ) ; ( ii ) cp violation in @xmath6 mixing matrix .",
    "this type of cp violation is manifest when @xmath114 ; and ( iii ) cp violation in the interference of decays with and without mixing .",
    "this type of cp violation is possible for a subset of final states to which both @xmath15 and @xmath16 can decay .    for a given final state @xmath14 , cp violating contributions",
    "can be summarized in the parameter _",
    "f = = r_m e^i(+)| | , where @xmath113 and @xmath115 are the amplitudes for @xmath116 and @xmath117 transitions respectively and @xmath118 is the strong phase difference between @xmath113 and @xmath115 .",
    "here @xmath119 represents the convention - independent weak phase difference between the ratio of decay amplitudes and the mixing matrix .",
    "presently , experimental information about the @xmath6 mixing parameters @xmath107 and @xmath105 comes from the time - dependent analyses that can roughly be divided into two categories .",
    "first , more traditional studies look at the time dependence of @xmath120 decays , where @xmath14 is the final state that can be used to tag the flavor of the decayed meson .",
    "the most popular is the non - leptonic doubly cabibbo suppressed decay @xmath121 .",
    "time - dependent studies allow one to separate the dcsd from the mixing contribution @xmath122 , @xmath123 = e^{-\\gamma t}|a_{k^-\\pi^+}|^2 \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\nonumber",
    "\\\\ \\times ~\\left [ r+\\sqrt{r}r_m(y'\\cos\\phi - x'\\sin\\phi)\\gamma t + \\frac{r_m^2}{4}(y^2+x^2)(\\gamma t)^2 \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is the ratio of dcs and cabibbo favored ( cf ) decay rates .",
    "since @xmath107 and @xmath105 are small , the best constraint comes from the linear terms in @xmath125 that are also _ linear _ in @xmath107 and @xmath105 . a direct extraction of @xmath107 and @xmath105 from eq .",
    "( [ kpi ] ) is not possible due to unknown relative strong phase @xmath25 of dcs and cf amplitudes  @xcite , as @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "as discussed above , this phase can be measured independently  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding formula can also be written  @xcite for @xmath16 decay with @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "second , @xmath15 mixing can be measured by comparing the lifetimes extracted from the analysis of @xmath29 decays into the cp - even and cp - odd final states .",
    "this study is also sensitive to a _ linear _ function of @xmath105 via -1= y - x .",
    "time - integrated studies of the semileptonic transitions are sensitive to the _ quadratic _ form @xmath130 and at the moment are not competitive with the analyses discussed above .",
    "the construction of new tau - charm factories cleo - c and bes - iii will introduce new _ time - independent _ methods that are sensitive to a linear function of @xmath105 .",
    "one can again use the fact that heavy meson pairs produced in the decays of heavy quarkonium resonances have the useful property that the two mesons are in the cp - correlated states  @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( [ tcfinitial ] ) ) .    by tagging one of the mesons as a cp eigenstate",
    ", a lifetime difference may be determined by measuring the leptonic branching ratio of the other meson .",
    "its semileptonic _ width _ should be independent of the cp quantum number since it is flavor specific , yet its _ branching ratio _ will be inversely proportional to the total width of that meson .",
    "since we know whether this @xmath131 state is tagged as a ( cp - eigenstate ) @xmath132 from the decay of @xmath133 to a final state @xmath134 of definite cp - parity @xmath135 , we can easily determine @xmath105 in terms of the semileptonic branching ratios of @xmath132 .",
    "this can be expressed simply by introducing the ratio [ defcor ] r^l_= , where @xmath136 in @xmath137 stands for an inclusive set of all final states .",
    "a deviation from @xmath138 implies a lifetime difference .",
    "keeping only the leading ( linear ) contributions due to mixing , @xmath105 can be extracted from this experimentally obtained quantity , @xmath139 the current experimental upper bounds on @xmath107 and @xmath105 are on the order of a few times @xmath140 , and are expected to improve significantly in the coming years . to regard a future discovery of nonzero @xmath107 or @xmath105 as a signal for new physics , we would need high confidence that the standard model predictions lie well below the present limits . as was recently shown  @xcite , in the standard model , @xmath107 and @xmath105",
    "are generated only at second order in su(3)@xmath141 breaking , x , y ~^2_c ^2 , where @xmath142 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "therefore , predicting the standard model values of @xmath107 and @xmath105 depends crucially on estimating the size of su(3)@xmath141 breaking .",
    "although @xmath105 is expected to be determined by the standard model processes , its value nevertheless affects significantly the sensitivity to new physics of experimental analyses of @xmath29 mixing  @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions of @xmath107 and @xmath105 within and beyond the standard model span several orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "roughly , there are two approaches , neither of which give very reliable results because @xmath143 is in some sense intermediate between heavy and light . the `` inclusive '' approach is based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) . in the @xmath144 limit , where @xmath145 is a scale characteristic of the strong interactions , @xmath146 and @xmath147 can be expanded in terms of matrix elements of local operators@xcite .",
    "such calculations yield @xmath148 .",
    "the use of the ope relies on local quark - hadron duality , and on @xmath149 being small enough to allow a truncation of the series after the first few terms .",
    "the charm mass may not be large enough for these to be good approximations , especially for nonleptonic @xmath29 decays .",
    "an observation of @xmath105 of order @xmath140 could be ascribed to a breakdown of the ope or of duality , but such a large value of @xmath105 is certainly not a generic prediction of ope analyses .",
    "the `` exclusive '' approach sums over intermediate hadronic states , which may be modeled or fit to experimental data@xcite .",
    "since there are cancellations between states within a given @xmath92 multiplet , one needs to know the contribution of each state with high precision . however , the @xmath29 is not light enough that its decays are dominated by a few final states . in the absence of sufficiently precise data on many decay rates and on strong phases ,",

    ". the only robust potential signal of new physics in charm system at this stage is cp violation .",
    "cp violation in @xmath29 decays and mixing can be searched for by a variety of methods .",
    "for instance , time - dependent decay widths for @xmath151 are sensitive to cp violation in mixing ( see eq.([kpi ] ) ) . provided that the @xmath107 and @xmath105 are comparable to experimental sensitivities , a combined analysis of @xmath151 and @xmath152 can yield interesting constraints on cp - violating parameters  @xcite .",
