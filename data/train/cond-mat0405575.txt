    "solvation effects are of great importance in understanding the degree of solubility of ions in various polar solvents @xcite .",
    "a large number of papers have been devoted on this problem @xcite .",
    "the theoretical approaches range from solving phenomenological continuum models to performing computer simulations on microscopic models .",
    "originally , born used a simple continuum theory of electrostatics to derive the solvation ( polarization ) free energy of a single ion with charge @xmath0 @xcite , g_b= -(z^2e^2/2r_b ) ( 1- 1/ ) , [ eq:1.1 ] where @xmath1 represents the ionic radius @xcite . in his theory the solvent dielectric constant @xmath2 is assumed to be homogeneous and the contribution without polarization ( @xmath3 ) or in vacuum is subtracted . in the line of continuum models , considerable efforts have been made to take into account the dielectric saturation near the ion core ( which are particularly crucial for multivalent ions ) @xcite .",
    "the born theory also neglects possible inhomogeneity of @xmath2 in the vicinity of the ion due to a change in the density for one - component fluids or in the concentration for binary fluid mixtures ( electrostriction ) @xcite .",
    "we point out that the previous theories have not yet treated the physics on mesoscopic scales such as solvation effects on phase transitions or collective phenomena at non - dilute salt concentrations . in this paper",
    "we will show that such effects can be conveniently studied within a scheme of ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "first , we will apply this approach to solvation around a charged particle in polar binary mixtures near the consolute critical point . here",
    "important is the gradient free energy well - known in the field of critical phenomena @xcite , which will reasonably accounts for the long - range electrostriction around ions . in the previous theories @xcite in the physical chemistry , the gradient free energy has been neglected .",
    "on the basis of these results we will then discuss the effects of low - density salt in polar binary mixtures in a debye - h@xmath4ckel type approximation .",
    "this second part is an extension of a previous paper by one of the present authors @xcite .",
    "we also note that similar effects have recently been discussed when the solvent is a liquid crystal @xcite , where the director field can be much deformed around a charged particle over a long distance .",
    "we place a charged particle in a near - critical binary mixture in a one - phase state in equilibrium , in which the dielectric constant @xmath5 depends strongly on the concentration .",
    "this is the case when the two components have very different dielectric constants , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath6 considerably larger than @xmath8 .",
    "there is no established theory of the dielectric constant of such mixtures .",
    "however , empirically , @xmath2 can be expressed roughly as a linear function of the concentration in many relevant mixtures @xcite . in the present theory , for simplicity , we assume the linear dependence , = _ 0+_1 , [ eq:2.1 ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constants ( with @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 is the concentration or the volume fraction of the preferred component @xmath14 .",
    "debye and kleboth @xcite performed a light scattering experiment on a mixture of nitrobenzene ( nb)+ 2,2,4-trimethylpentane in electric field , for which @xmath15 increased from 2.1 to 34.2 with increasing nb with @xmath16 near the critical point .",
    "the measured curve of @xmath15 vs @xmath13 may be fairly fitted to the linear form ( 2.1 ) ( and fitting is better in the region @xmath17 ) . in their experiment",
