    "it has recently been reported by @xcite that there is a relationship between the peak luminosity of gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) and the pulse time lag between batse energy channels . specifically , they find that the peak luminosity @xmath0 is anticorrelated with the duration of the lag , @xmath1 , according to @xmath2 ergs / sec .",
    "this intriguing relationship is useful because it probes the properties of an ensemble of bursts and thereby can provide clues of the global dynamics of grbs .",
    "it also has the potential for distance estimation to grbs .",
    "several workers have attempted to explain the origin of the pulse lag , or so called pulse paradigm @xcite . @xcite were able to produce a pulse lag by modeling the burst as a series of internal shocks , but obtained timescales an order of magnitude too large .",
    "however , as @xcite point out , the lag timescale is much longer than the synchrotron cooling time .",
    "@xcite modeled the kinematics of internal shocks and found no evidence of pulse peak lag .",
    "as of yet , the source of the pulse paradigm remains a mystery .",
    "this paper does not attempt to explain the origin of the pulse lag , but assumes that it derives from a process common to all bursts and has some proper decay timescale @xmath3 in the reference frame of the emitter .",
    "in this paper i will present an interpretation of the luminosity - lag relationship as being due to relativistic motion of the emitting region toward the observer .",
    "thus it is a purely kinematic effect .",
    "in @xcite a peak @xmath4-ray luminosity @xmath0 was defined from the observed peak _ number _ flux @xmath5 , a luminosity distance @xmath6 derived from the observed redshift @xmath7 and a given cosmology , and a mean emitted photon energy @xmath8 , constant for all bursts : @xmath9 however , one does not know the intrinsic energy of the photons emanating from the pulses",
    ". therefore multiplication of all grb fluxes by an average photon energy @xmath8 , while useful to estimate grb peak luminosites , obfuscates the underlying relationships in the dynamics of grbs .",
    "in other words , photon number flux @xmath5 is the observed quantity and thus photon number luminosity @xmath10 can be the only calculable luminosity .    the luminosity distance @xmath6 is defined so that redshift of photons is accounted for . the photon number luminosity does not depend on photon energy redshift and thus is given by @xmath11    in figure [ numberluminosity ] is shown the peak number luminosity @xmath10 versus spectral lag @xmath1 for six bursts with known redshifts .",
    "i fit the data by minimizing @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "the best fit for lags ccf31 0.1 ( see fig . [ numberluminosity ] ) is @xmath14 with @xmath15 . by comparison , a similar fit of @xmath0 from eqn ( [ lumeqn ] ) versus @xmath1 reproduces the @xcite result @xmath16 with @xmath17 . for ccf31 0.5",
    ", @xmath18 with @xmath19 contrasts with @xmath20 with @xmath21 . with six datapoints ,",
    "these are small number statistics to be sure .",
    "however , the improvement in correlation @xmath10 vs. @xmath1 over that of @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 via reductions of @xmath22 by 25% or greater is clear .",
    "the relation @xmath23 , where 0.98 is almost 1 , is a strikingly simple statistical property for an ensemble of grbs to obey . in fact",
    "this relationship suggests a simple explanation .",
    "i propose that this proportionality is a result of variations in line - of - sight relativistic velocities of grbs .    for a burst expanding with lorentz factor @xmath24 , @xmath25 and at redshift @xmath7",
    ", the observed number luminosity @xmath26 ( photons sec@xmath27 ) varies as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the proper isotropic number luminosity for a non - expanding source .",
    "this expression is valid for emission that appears isotropic to the observer ( i.e. if the emission is in the form of a jet , then the opening angle @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the relativistic beaming angle ) .",
    "also , as mentioned previously , if one assumes that the spectral pulse lag is due to some proper decay timescale @xmath3 , possibly due to cooling or deceleration , then we observe a lag @xmath32 for @xmath33 , where the angular dependence is removed by the strong effect of attenuation of number flux @xmath34 received from emission moving at inclination angles greater than @xmath31 ; @xmath35 .",
    "thus one can focus one s attention only on emitters moving directly toward the observer . combining these then yields the inverse relationship @xmath36 this relationship is redshift independent and thus is valid for luminosity @xmath37 and spectral lag @xmath38 as would be observed local to the burst .",
    "thus we have an explanation of the relation shown in figure [ numberluminosity ] .",
    "i propose that the variety in the spectral lags and number luminosities of bursts depend solely upon the relativistic motion of the emitter along the line of sight .",
    "certainly one expects variation among bursts to cause deviations from this relationship , however the current data suggests this effect to be dominant .",
    "there are two possibilities for the nature of this variation ( see section [ sectionbeaming ] ) .",
    "first , we are observing an intrinsic range of burst expansion speeds , ranging from fast bursts having little or no spectral lag to slower bursts having longer lags .",
    "the second possibility is that emitting material is in the form of a jet with some angular dependence on the emitter s lorentz factor @xmath39 where the lorentz factor would have a peak at the centroid of the jet @xmath40 and monotonically decrease on some angular scale greater than @xmath31 for increasing inclination angles @xmath41 . in either case",
    "we observe only the emission dominated by those emitters moving with trajectories inclined within an angle @xmath31 from our line - of - sight .",
    "the above discussion allows the estimation of redshift @xmath7 from the observed peak number flux @xmath5 and the observed spectral lag @xmath42 . @xcite",
    "also estimate redshifts using grb variability to indicate luminosity . from eqn ( [ numlumeqn ] )",
    "one has @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the angular diameter distance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which is a function of the cosmology and redshift @xmath7 , but does not vary much over the interval @xmath45 .",
    "for example , here i follow @xcite and choose ( @xmath46,@xmath47 ) = ( 0.3,0.7 ) , for which @xmath48 to within 10% over this range of @xmath7 , where @xmath49 is the hubble distance ( choose @xmath50 km sec@xmath27 mpc@xmath27 ) .",
    "also , an observed spectral lag @xmath51 varies from the local spectral lag @xmath1 by @xmath52    one can put these components into the @xmath53 curve of bursts with known redshifts @xmath54 where @xmath55 photons as taken from the fit in figure [ numberluminosity ] . thus one can estimate a redshift for a given observed peak number flux and spectral lag @xmath56 where flux @xmath5 is measured in photons @xmath57 sec@xmath27 and @xmath51 is in seconds .",
    "it is worth noting that a well determined cosmology gives a well determined @xmath44 and thus a refined redshift @xmath7 .",
    "conversely , many independently determined redshifts might give cosmological information .",
    "however , the primary source of error in this relation is not the uncertainty in @xmath44 , but in the deviations of burst luminosities and lags from the relation of eqn ( [ ntrelation ] ) as can be seen in figure [ numberluminosity ] .",
    "in order for there to be a lag @xmath1 of the arrival of a pulse over an energy range fixed with respect to the observer ( e.g. the range between batse channels 1 and 3 ) that varies inversely with lorentz factor ( eqn [ dtobseqn ] ) , the peak energy of the pulse must decay exponentially as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the peak energy in the emitter frame , @xmath60 is observer time , @xmath4 is the lorentz factor of the emitter and @xmath61 is the proper decay timescale in the emitter frame .",
    "thus we infer an exponential decay law for the pulse peak energy .",
    "it is important to note that this exponential evolution can be very rapid ( @xmath62 msec ) @xcite and is distinct from the evolution of the pulse envelope ( the so - called fred ) that has been studied by many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one outstanding question in the study of grb pulses is the apparent invariance among bursts of the peak energy @xmath63 of the @xmath64 flux spectrum ( @xmath65 a few @xmath66 kev ) where @xmath67 is number flux per photon energy .",
    "one might expect this value to vary with burst luminosity , but it remains roughly constant ( to a factor of a few ) over a wide variety of ( long ) grbs .",
    "if the pulse photon number flux @xmath68 ( which , for demonstration , we assume to be peaked at @xmath69 ) increases as the peak photon energy @xmath69 of eqn ( [ epkeqn ] ) decreases , then there will be a maximum in @xmath70 .",
    "this may happen as follows : the nascent pulse emitter is extremely hot and compact .",
    "as it evolves , it cools ( @xmath69 drops ) and it expands or becomes progressively more optically thin , releasing an ever increasing photon rate @xmath68 .",
    "this is analogous to early - time supernova lightcurves @xcite . in this picture , uncovering the flux dependence @xmath71 will give insight into why @xmath72 constant .",
    "for instance @xmath73 with eqn ( [ epkeqn ] ) demonstrates this behavior .",
    "in this letter i have argued that the correlation of @xcite is between number luminosity and spectral lag and i interpret this as being due to the variety , among bursts , of relativistic velocities at which emitting regions move toward the observer .",
    "suppositions as to the physical emission process have been deliberately avoided in order to highlight this purely kinematic effect .",
    "there are two possible scenarios by which this might happen .",
    "the first is simply that the variation is due to the variation of expansion lorentz factor among bursts . from eqn ( [ dtobseqn ] ) , this implies that the ratio of maximum to minimum spectral lags is the same as the ratio of maximum to minumum lorentz factors @xmath74 where observed lags are seen to range over roughly two orders of magnitude .",
    "thus if the fastest bursts have @xmath75 , then the minimum bursts would have @xmath76 and thus may be only mildly relativistic .",
    "the second possibility is that grb ejecta is directed in a jet such that the lorentz factor @xmath39 has some maximum @xmath40 and monotonically decreases with increasing angle .",
    "thus the function @xmath39 will determine the relative numbers of bursts observed with given spectral lags .",
    "@xcite has noted that the distribution of bursts is strongly peaked at small lags indicating that the lorentz factor of emitting ejecta , @xmath77 , is basically constant over the jet opening angle @xmath78 , with a fairly narrow edge region @xmath79 of decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "thus let us estimate a characteristic opening angle @xmath78 by assuming that @xmath80 is constant for @xmath81 and decreases to order unity within a narrow boundary or `` edge '' region @xmath82 .",
    "thus the solid angle subtended by `` face '' bursts ( i.e. observed at inclinations @xmath83 ) is @xmath84 , and that for `` edge '' bursts is @xmath85 and the ratio is : @xmath86 from fig . 3 of @xcite , one can estimate this ratio , by defining short lags @xmath87 sec as `` face '' and the longer lags as `` edge '' bursts , to be @xmath88 .",
    "assuming @xmath89 , then this gives @xmath90 . with more statistics of the distribution of bursts along the curve of eqn .",
    "( [ nteqn ] ) one can fit the function @xmath39 much more precisely ."
