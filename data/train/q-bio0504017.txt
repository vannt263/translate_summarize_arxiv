    "motivated by the observations reported above , the dynamics of the min proteins is assumed to be driven by four properties of the min proteins  @xcite : i ) a high affinity of atp - bound mind for the membrane , ii ) a high affinity of mine for membrane - bound mind , iii ) a mine - induced increase of the atp hydrolysis - rate by mind , which leads to the detachment of minde - complexes from the membrane , and iv ) interactions between membrane - bound proteins .",

    "early experiments indicated an accumulation of mine close to the cell center  @xcite .",
    "this accumulation is commonly referred to as the mine - ring . more recently , using deconvolution techniques , mine has been found to be arranged in a helix with accumulation close to the cell center and , although weaker , at the cell poles  @xcite . it has been suggested that the helical arrangement of mine is induced by the helical arrangement of mind and that the accumulation of mine occurs at the ends of the mind helix  @xcite . in cells mutant for mine",
    ", oscillations have been observed in the absence of a mine - ring  @xcite . in that case , the temporal period is larger than in non - mutant cells .",
    "still , this experiment clearly shows that the mine - ring is not necessary for the oscillations .    in the one - dimensional description presented above ,",
    "mine - rings correspond to maxima in the minde distribution . in the examples given so far ,",
    "such maxima only occur at the system boundaries . for system lengths close to the value at which the pattern acquires a new stripe ,",
    "maxima can be detected closer to the system s center .",
    "however , this is unlikely to be the mechanism for mine - ring formation in _",
    "e.  coli _ , because no dependence of the existence of the ring on the cell size has been reported .",
    "furthermore , as argued above , in the limit of homogenous cytosolic mind- and mine - distributions , maxima in the minde - distribution are induced by maxima in the mind - distribution .",
    "mind - rings are not observed experimentally , though .",
    "there are at least three other possible mechanisms that can in principle account for the observed accumulation of mine at the ends of the mind - helix . in the first mechanism ,",
    "the diffusion length of cytosolic mine , @xmath90 , is shorter than half of the cell length . in this case",
    ", cytosolic mine will predominantly attach before it has reached the opposite cell pole , which might lead to an accumulation close to the cell center .",

    "accordingly , the ring vanished in @xcite when the attachment rate of mine was reduced , leading to an increase of @xmath91 . to test whether this mechanism is supported by the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dynd])-([eq : dynde ] ) , we studied the system for finite values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in this case the cytosolic distributions @xmath94 and @xmath95 are not homogenous and all four equations have to be solved simultaneously . for the parameter values considered above , the oscillation patterns do not change significantly as long as the diffusion constants @xmath92 and @xmath93 are larger than 0.1@xmath42m@xmath96 and no maxima of @xmath4 independent of maxima of @xmath84 were found .",

    "note , that by assumption , the one - dimensional description is only appropriate if the diffusion length @xmath91 is larger than the cell diameter , i.e. , @xmath100 m . we conclude , that this mechanism is not supported by the dynamic equations presented above and can be tested only in a three - dimensional description .",
    "two other mechanisms of mine - ring formation are suggested by studies of kinesin - subfamily kin13 members  @xcite .",
    "these proteins induce the depolymerization of microtubules . in this process",
    "they accumulate at both ends of the microtubule . as mine might act on mind filaments in much the same way , accumulation of mine",
    "could follow from a similar mechanism as accumulation of the kin13-kinesins .",
    "the latter could be a consequence of a higher affinity of the microtubule end for binding the motor .",
    "related ideas for the binding of mine to mind have been proposed in @xcite and also in @xcite .",
    "the analogy with kin13-kinesins offers still another explanation for the accumluation of mine , namely dynamic accumulation due to processive depolymerization @xcite . the present framework for studying the dynamics of min - proteins",
    "is not suited for studying these effects , as filaments are not explicitly incorporated .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "we have presented a phenomenological description of the dynamics of mind and mine in _",
    "e.  coli_. the description is based on the binding of mind to the cytosolic membrane , recruitment of mine to the membrane by membrane - bound mind , mine - induced detachment of mind , as well as an interaction between molecules bound to the membrane . for a sufficiently strong attraction between membrane - bound mind - molecules ,",
    "these processes generate pole - to - pole oscillations of the min - proteins .",
    "the phenomenological form of the current for membrane - bound mind used in the present work captures generic features of the protein interaction and does not refer to a specific microscopic mechanism .",
    "it allows for a quantitative comparison between the oscillatory solutions of the dynamic equations and experimental findings . in agreement with the latter ,",
    "oscillations with a temporal period from 40s to 120s can be obtained .",
    "this value is essentially determined by the detachment rate @xmath11 of minde - complexes . for the parameter values given in the text , the oscillatory pattern acquires a second stripe for a system size of 3@xmath42 m , which agrees well with the smallest bacterial length for which period doubling is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tvsljumps]b .",
    "this length is essentially determined by the ratio of the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    ", this feature could obviously be used to couple assembly of the z - ring to the cell length and hence to control the cell cycle .",
    "the phenomenological description of the aggregation current can be related to microscopic descriptions of the protein dynamics .",
    "a simple process leading to aggregation is based on short - range pair interaction potentials . in this case , the phenomenological parameters are linked to microscopic quantities by  @xcite @xmath101 and analogously for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "the range for mind - mind interactions is then 350 nm and for mind - minde interactions 10 nm . while all other values are acceptable , the range for mind - mind interactions is too large for pure electrostatic interactions .",
    "this points to more involved microscopic dynamics of membrane - bound mind than discussed here .",
    "our analysis of the dynamic equations ( [ eq : dynd])-([eq : dynde ] ) has focused on the case of homogenous cytosolic distributions of mind and mine , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "solutions in this limit are very similar to solutions to the full equations if the diffusion constants of both mind and mine have the realistic value of 2.5@xmath42m@xmath107/s .",
    "this implies that the approximation of constant @xmath94 and @xmath95 is appropriate .",
    "apart from providing a reduced set of equations that is more convenient to study than the four equations of the full system , this approximation might also have an important implication regarding experiments .",
    "one might expect that oscillations should be observable in a purified system containing essentially only mind , mine , and phospholipid vesicles .",
    "the analysis presented here suggests that oscillations will show up in presence of a homogenous distribution of cytosolic proteins .",
    "therefore , the closed geometry of the bacterium might not be essential and an open geometry could be used instead .",
    "a second implication of our analysis is that the number of available binding sites might need to be limited in order to produce oscillations .",
    "other mechanisms that have been suggested for the min - oscillations agree in the essential assumptions with the one studied here , namely the ability of atp - dependent binding of mind to the membrane , the recruitment of mine to the membrane by mind , and the release of mind from the membrane driven by mine .",
    "the proposed mechanisms differ , however , in essential points .",

    "assume that mind and mine form complexes in the cytosol and bind together to the membrane  @xcite .",
    "this implies in particular an exponential increase of the temporal period of the oscillations with the system length , with a period of 1000s for a system of length 7@xmath42 m .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the behavior reported for the mechanism studied in this work , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tvsljumps]a . the experimental data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tvsljumps]b show oscillation periods that do not exceed 120s for bacteria of a length up to 10@xmath42 m . however , more experiments are needed , in particular to obtain simultaneously values for the protein densities and the oscillation period of individual bacteria .",
    "the system studied by huang et al . differs from the one studied here in the way mind - aggregates are formed on the membrane  @xcite .",
    "there mind aggregation follows a one - step process : attachment to the membrane occurs with a higher rate at locations where mind is already bound .",
    "in contrast we considered a two step - process , namely , cytosolic mind binds first to the membrane and only then self - assembles into a filament .",
    "this difference might at first sight seem minor .",
    "however , it leads to striking differences in the model behaviours .",
    "first of all , assuming a one - step process for mind aggregation , a three - dimensional geometry as well as a finite atp - exchange rate is required to generate striped oscillation patterns in long systems .",
    "secondly , in the model by huang et al .",
    "there are no oscillatory solutions at all for homogenous cytosolic distributions .",
    "furthermore , as discussed above , in the model studied here , mine - rings have not been found to form by the mechanism underlying formation of the mine - ring in the model by huang et al .",
    "the differences in the mechanism for mind aggregation thus lead to striking consequences for the collective behaviour of the min proteins .",
    "one possibility to discriminate between the two mechanisms is by studying the dynamics of min proteins that are not confined to a cell .",
    "further analysis of the models might lead to other possible key experiments .    in combination ,",
    "all proposed mechanisms underlying the min oscillations suggest new experiments that will allow us to understand the min - oscillations better . in order to make even closer contact with experiments , the formation of mind helices",
    "must be included .",
    "fluctuations due to the moderate number of min - molecules might play an important role . first attempts in studying the influence of fluctuations on the oscillations have been undertaken  @xcite , but further work is needed and will probably yield results of relevance for pattern formation in the presence of noise beyond the min - system .",

    "in this appendix it is shown , how the dynamics in three spatial dimensions can effectively be reduced to a description in one spatial dimension . the bacterium is conveniently approximated by a cylinder with radius @xmath108 and length @xmath26 .",
    "the volume densities of cytosolic mind and mine at a given point are @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath103 and @xmath111 denote the radial and azimuthal coordinate , respectively , while @xmath5 is the coordinate along the long axis .",
    "their time evolution is goverened by @xmath112 here , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the surface densities of membrane - bound mind and minde - complexes , @xmath113 is the three - dimensional laplace - operator and the factors of @xmath114 restrict attachment to and detachment from the cytoplasmic membrane to a region adjacent to the cell wall .",
    "since the diffusion constant of cytosolic mind and mine is of the order of @xmath115 , whereas the period of the oscillations is about 1min , it is reasonable to assume the density of cytosolic mind and mine to be homogenous perpendicular to the bacterial long axis .",
    "the volume densities of cytosolic mind and mine can then be replaced by surface densities @xmath116 and @xmath117 with @xmath118 then , the equations governing the evolution of the protein densities read @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the aggregation current of mind on the inner cell membrane and @xmath121 the two - dimensional laplace operator on the cylinder surface .    it has been shown that mind forms a filamentous structure on the inner cell membrane  @xcite .",
    "projection on this structure yields line - densities , e.g. , @xmath122 .",
    "they are connected to the surface densities via @xmath123 where @xmath124 parametrizes the mind - helix on the inner cell membrane .",
    "the dynamic equations for the line densities @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 are then given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dynd])-([eq : dynde ] ) .",
    "the current @xmath129 appearing there is obtained by projection of the surface current @xmath130 on the @xmath5-direction .",
    "note , that a description of the formation of mind - helices would require also a specification of the perpendicular component of the current @xmath130 .",
