    "although this definition assumes a continuous scalar field , in practice the power spectrum can only be measured by discrete samplings .",
    "usually , the scalar field is sampled on a set of regularly spaced grid points and then analyzed by using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) . as explained in appendix  [ sect : alias ] , the biggest problem of using fft to measure the power spectrum is the aliasing effect , namely the discrete fourier transform does not give the power spectrum of the scalar field but a sum of aliases of the continuous fourier transform of the scalar field @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the nyquist frequency , @xmath102 is the box size , @xmath103 is the number of cells in one dimension of the fft mesh , and @xmath104 is a position vector which indicates the alias . without prior knowledge of the power spectrum ( e.g. , its shape ) ,",
    "it is impossible to remove the aliasing effect from the true signal .",
    "however , it is possible to minimize such aliasing effects by increasing the resolution of the fft mesh . if the nyquist frequency is high enough , the alias can be separated from the true signal in the main region @xmath105 and so its effect can be minimized .    in this work",
    ", we assign the values of scalar fields to the fft grid without smoothing @xmath106 where @xmath107 represents the positions of the fft grid points , and @xmath108 is the sampled signal on those points .",

    "although the discrete particles induce shot noise , the fourier transform of the density field , in principle , can be evaluated accurately by a direct sum over the modes of the fourier transform of each particle @xmath124 however , this method is numerically unfeasible for n - body simulations since they usually contain a large number of particles and eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) does not have a fast algorithm like the fft due to the irregular distribution of points . in practice , in order to improve the efficiency , the power spectrum of discrete particles can be measured by assigning particles to a regular grid and then analyzing them using the fft . the assignment of particles is equivalent to smoothing the underlying density field and then putting the averaged values on an fft grid .",
    "this smoothing effect , however , can be exactly corrected afterwards . furthermore , with the aid of further correction strategies ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the aliasing effect can be significantly suppressed and a reasonable accuracy of the power spectrum can be obtained with less computational expense . although this method is not fully free of bias and aliasing in general , it provides an alternative way to our amr - fft method for measuring the power spectrum of the effective density field .",

    ", we can first identify the clusters in x - ray surveys and measure the effective mass of each cluster .",
    "then we divide the clusters into different mass bins .",
    "we measure @xmath150 for each mass bin .",
    "similarly , we can measure @xmath149 for each mass bin as well . in the @xmath1cdm model , for a given mass bin",
    "the measurements of @xmath150 and @xmath149 should be the same @xmath151 .",
    "however , in @xmath0 gravity , @xmath150 and @xmath149 can be different .",
    "there are two main reasons for the differences .",
    "the major one is due to mass calibration . given a mass bin , the number of clusters with messes determined by effective mass will be quite different from the number determined by the true mass ( see mass functions in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the second reason is due to the positions of cluster centers .",
    "the centers of effective masses do not necessarily overlap with the true masses , especially for small clusters .",
    "since the power spectrum encompasses the above two effects , it should be more useful than the mass function to test @xmath0 gravity .",
    "next , we test the above idea using simulations .",
    "we construct halo catalogs using a modified version of the amiga halo finder ( ahf )  @xcite . in halo - halo power spectrum @xmath149 , halo number density fields",
    "are represented by un - weighted particles .",
    "we therefore can use the powmes code to measure the power spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ halopk ] , we present the ratio of the effective halo power spectrum to the standard halo power spectrum for different @xmath0 models .",
    "different colours represent different mass bins . in fig .",
    "[ halopk ] , note that shot noise has already been subtracted . on relatively large scales , the values of effective halo power spectra are less than those of the standard halos @xmath152 for given mass bin .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ halopk ] , on relatively large scales ( @xmath153 ) , for @xmath2 and @xmath62 , the ratio @xmath148 deviates from the @xmath1cdm prediction ( the dashed line ) at a level of almost @xmath154 . for @xmath3 , due to the screening mechanism , the ratio for massive clusters ( @xmath155 ) is consistent with the @xmath1cdm prediction .",
    "however , for less massive clusters ( @xmath156 ) , the deviations are over @xmath157 .",
    "further , it can also be found that for @xmath2 and @xmath62 , the errors on the ratio are greater than for @xmath3 .",
    "this is because the effective power spectra have larger scatters for the former two cases than for @xmath3 as shown in fig .",
    "[ deltaeffpk ] .",
    "the large errors on small scales ( @xmath158 ) are due to shot noise .",
    "in particular , for the most massive clusters ( @xmath155 ) , we only have a few hundred samples .",
    "the level of shot noise is quite high there . finally , due to the limited box size and number of realizations , the simulations performed in this work",
    "tend to over estimate the errors . with a larger simulation box and more realizations ,",
    "the error bars can be reduced and the deviations of @xmath0 models from the @xmath1cdm model should be more clear .",
    "the results presented above therefore are very conservative .",
    "in this work , we have studied the non - linear power spectra of scalar fields in @xmath0 gravity , using a suite of n - body simulations .",
    "we have illustrated in detail our amr - fft method for measuring the power spectra of scalar fields . using this method ,",
    "we have measured the power spectra of the potentials and the effective density fields .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows :    * we have verified the inequality @xmath159 in fourier space by comparing the power spectra of the potentials . as is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the above inequality is closely related to the screening mechanism in @xmath0 gravity . its validity is important for predicting the screening theoretically .",
    "* we find that compared with the dark matter power spectra , the effective power spectra differ more significantly from the @xmath1cdm model . even for @xmath3 , the effective power spectrum shows a sizeable signal of deviation .",
    "we have tested that these conclusions are applicable to other @xmath0 models as well . for hu - sawicki model  @xcite",
    ", we find similar results as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the formation and clustering of galaxies in @xmath0 gravity is more closely related to the effective density field rather than the dark matter density field itself , our findings indicate that the traditional statistics of the dark matter density field such as the power spectrum or equivalently the two - point correlation function may seriously under - predict the impact of modifications of gravity on the clustering of galaxies .",
    "however , it should be noted that although the power spectrum of the effective density field in @xmath0 gravity is significantly different from that in the @xmath1cdm model , we should caution that these large deviations are likely to be highly degenerate with galaxy bias .",
    "robust constraints on @xmath0 gravity can thus only be obtained once we have a solid knowledge of the expected biasing of galaxies in @xmath0 cosmologies .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to find that the power spectrum @xmath146 is quite different from @xmath147 in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "this can be used to discriminate the theory from the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "we tested this idea by investigating the halo - halo power spectrum on relatively large scales .",
    "galaxy clusters can be observed using different methods and a wealth of information about the clusters can be obtained .",
    "we found that probing the ratio @xmath148 is an useful way to test @xmath0 gravity . on relatively large scales ( @xmath153 ) , for @xmath2 and @xmath62 , the ratio deviates from the @xmath1cdm prediction at a level of almost @xmath154 .",
    "for @xmath3 , due to the screening mechanism , the ratio for massive clusters ( @xmath155 ) is consistent with the @xmath1cdm prediction .",
    "however , for less massive clusters ( @xmath156 ) , the deviations are over @xmath157 .",
    "in fact , due to the limited box size and number of realizations , the simulations performed in this work tend to over estimate the errors .",
    "our results therefore can be further improved with a larger simulation box and more realizations .",
    "the results quoted the above are very conservative .",
    "it is interesting to note that the latest all - sky planck catalog of sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) sources  @xcite has already accumulated over @xmath160 clusters .",
    "the clusters are distributed over a large area of the sky .",
    "if the pointed x - ray follow - up information is available in the future , the catalog can be used to test @xmath0 gravity .",
    "further , upcoming the erosita survey  @xcite will have the ability to discover over @xmath161 clusters .",
    "the shot noise of the measured power spectrum can be reduced significantly .",
    "our idea can also be further extended .",
    "it is interesting to know that the ratio @xmath140 is strongly scale dependent especially when @xmath162 ( see .",
    "[ ppnratio ] ) , on which scales the galaxy bias is expected to be approximately scale independent .",
    "unlike the halo number density field , the total number density field of galaxies , including both central and satellite galaxies , ought to have a close tie with the effective density field .",
    "this is because , for massive halos @xmath163 , the total number of satellite galaxies formed inside such halos should relate to the effective mass rather than the true mass of the halos .",
    "thus , if we work with the assumption that galaxies are tracers of the effective density field then their clustering properties can be used to infer the power spectrum of the potential @xmath147 .",
    "the power spectrum of the lensing potential @xmath146 can then be inferred from weak lensing data .",
    "future galaxy surveys such as the euclid mission  @xcite will measure both of these statistics in the same region of the sky on large scales . by combining these two pieces of information",
    "we may be able to place robust constraints on @xmath0 gravity .",
    "however , this method requires an understanding of galaxy formation in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "we therefore shall elaborate on this idea in detail in future work .",
