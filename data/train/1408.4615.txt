    "many theoretical predictions for the production of doubly heavy baryons @xmath22 have been done in refs.@xcite , where @xmath23 stands for heavy @xmath8 or @xmath7 quark , respectively . for convenience , throughout the paper , we take @xmath9 as a short notation for the baryon @xmath24 , with @xmath25 equals to the light quark @xmath26 , @xmath27 , or @xmath28 , respectively . among the doubly heavy baryons @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ,",
    "only @xmath1 has been observed by the selex fixed - target experiment  @xcite .",
    "however , the selex measurements on the @xmath1 properties , such as its decay width and production rate , are much larger than the theoretical predictions  @xcite , even by including the extrinsic and intrinsic charm production mechanisms  @xcite . at present , its observations are also lack of supports from other experiments  @xcite .",
    "thus , in addition to the hadronic platforms , it is helpful to find other platforms which can generate large amounts of baryon events to study the baryon properties more precisely .",
    "we shall study the doubly heavy baryon photoproduction in the future @xmath0 international linear collider ( ilc ) within the framework of the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) theory  @xcite . within this platform",
    ", the doubly heavy baryons can be produced through the channel via a single virtual photon or a @xmath29 boson , @xmath30 , or through the photonproduction channel via the double photon collision , @xmath4 .",
    "it is found that the production cross section for the single photon/@xmath29 process shall be highly suppressed  @xcite , which is about two orders lower than that of the photoproduction channel .",
    "so , in the present paper , we shall concentrate on the photoproduction channel .",
    "one can treat the photoproduction of the baryon by two steps .",
    "the first step is for the incident photons coming from the electron and positron beams to produce the heavy @xmath31 and @xmath32 pairs .",
    "this step is pqcd calculable and can be treated by using the improved helicity amplitude approach  @xcite .",
    "the second step is that the heavy quarks @xmath5 and @xmath6 evolving into a binding diquark @xmath12 with color- and spin- configuration @xmath11 $ ] , e.g. , @xmath11=[^3s_1]_{\\bar{\\textbf{3}}}$ ] , @xmath14_{\\textbf{6}}$ ] for @xmath33 or @xmath34 diquark and @xmath35 $ ] , @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 $ ] , and @xmath38 $ ] , respectively .",
    "then , the diquark @xmath10 $ ] shall be hadronized into the doubly heavy baryons @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 via fragmentation .",
    "similar factorization procedures have also been suggested for dealing with the @xmath39 or @xmath40 baryon production  @xcite .    according to nrqcd",
    ", the @xmath22 baryon can be expanded over the fock states , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the relative velocity of the constituent heavy quarks in the baryon rest frame .",
    "usually , it is stated that all the baryons are dominated by the first fock state @xmath43 , then the emitted gluon from the heavy quark for @xmath44 in @xmath14_{\\textbf{6}}$ ] state must change the spin of the heavy quark ; thus , the probability coefficient @xmath45 shall dominant over other coefficients , or equivalently , @xmath46 shall be at least @xmath47-suppressed to @xmath48 and can be neglected . here",
    "@xmath48 stands for the probability of transforming the color antitriplet diquark into the baryon and @xmath46 stands for the probability of transforming the color sextuplet diquark into the baryon .",
    "a different power counting rule over @xmath42-expansion has also been suggested in the literature .",
    "ref.@xcite suggests that the second fock state @xmath49 can be of the same importance as @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "its main idea lies in that one of the heavy quarks can emit a gluon , which does not need to change the spin of the heavy quark , and this gluon can further split into a light @xmath51 pair ; the light quarks can also emit gluons , and finally , the baryon components can be formed with a light quark @xmath25 plus one or more soft gluons . since the light quark can emit gluons easily , we have @xmath52 . as a rough order estimation , we take the transition probabilities for those diquark states to form the corresponding baryon to be the same , i.e. , @xmath53 . following this approximation , we shall find that the color sextuplet diquark component can also provide sizable contributions to the baryon production .",
    "it is found that those matrix elements are overall parameters , and their uncertainties can be conveniently discussed when we know their values well . for convenience , we will adopt the assumption @xmath53 to do our discussions throughout the paper .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we present the formulation for dealing with the photoproduction channel @xmath4 at the leading - order level . in sec.iii , we give the numerical results .",
    "sec.iv is reserved for a summary .",
    "at the leading order @xmath54 , within the nrqcd factorization approach , the differential cross section for the channel @xmath4 can be formulated as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 stands for the long - distance matrix element , which is proportional to the inclusive transition probability of the perturbative state , @xmath10 $ ] pair into the heavy baryon @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath57 is the hard scattering amplitude , which is calculable since the intermediate gluon should be hard enough to generate a heavy @xmath31 or @xmath58 pair .",
    "@xmath59 means we need to average over the spin states of the electron and positron and sum over the color and spin of all final particles .",

    "@xmath61 is the density function of the incident photon  @xcite .",
    "there are totally 20 feynman diagrams for the channel @xmath62 .",
    "we put 10 diagrams in fig .",
    "[ yyfeny ] , the other 10 feynman diagrams can be obtained by exchanging the positions of the initial photons attached to the quark lines .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath63 can be estimated within certain phenomenological models  @xcite .",

    "the normalization factor @xmath71 can be fixed by the normalization condition , @xmath72 , which leads to @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the hard scattering amplitude @xmath76 for the process can be written in a general form as    @xmath77    where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are interaction vertexes , which contain the dirac-@xmath81 matrixes only . @xmath82 and the like are fermion propagators .",
    "@xmath83 is the scalar part of the propagators for the whole amplitude .",
    "the momentum of the constituent quarks are @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 is the color factor defined as @xmath87 where the subindices @xmath88 and @xmath89 are color indices of the constituent heavy quarks , and @xmath90 is the color of the diquark .",
    "@xmath91 is the color index of the gluon propagator .",
    "@xmath92 is the normalization factor .",
    "the function @xmath93 equals the antisymmetric @xmath94 ( the symmetric @xmath95 ) for the color antitriplet @xmath96 ( the color sextuplet @xmath97 ) of @xmath12 diquark .",
    "the sum of the anti - symmetric and the symmetric functions satisfy the following equations @xmath98 and @xmath99 with the help of the above relations , we obtain @xmath100 for the color - antitriplet diquark state and @xmath101 for the color - sextuplet diquark state , respectively .",
    "all the amplitudes @xmath102 with @xmath78 contain massive quark lines , so it is too complicated and lengthy by using the conventional trace technique to deal with the amplitude square .",
    "to shorten the calculations and to make the results more compact , we adopt the improved helicity amplitude approach  @xcite to deal with the difficulty of calculating the expressions for the yields when the quark masses can not be neglected .",
    "it is found that we can connect the doubly heavy baryon production with those of doubly heavy quarkonium production .",
    "we have made a detailed discussion on the heavy quarkonium production at the ilc under the improved helicity amplitude approach via the channel @xmath103(n)\\rangle+q'+\\bar{q}$ ] in ref .",
    "@xcite . to compare with the quarkonium case , by applying the charge conjugation matrix @xmath104 and the transverse of the matrix element to the amplitude @xmath102",
    ", we can transform eq .",
    "( [ ampform ] ) as    @xmath105    where @xmath106 stands for the number of the @xmath81-matrixes appearing in the amplitude @xmath107 .",
    "the second line is the matrix element for the heavy quarkonium production , which indicates that the amplitudes for the diquark production are merely different from those of the heavy quarkonium case with an overall factor @xmath108 .",
    "thus , inversely , we can conveniently derive the hard scattering amplitudes @xmath107 from ref .",
