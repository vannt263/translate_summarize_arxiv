    "spectroscopic observations of the optical counterpart were made with the osiris spectrograph on the 10.4-m gtc in la palma ( spain ) using its service observing mode on 2012 september 14 .",
    "three consecutive 900-s long - slit spectra of r1000b grism were obtained at the parallactic angle of each exposure under @xmath10 1  seeing condition around @xmath10 1.2 airmass .",
    "the slit width and length were 1  and 8 , respectively ; the pixel spatial sampling was 025 .",
    "the spectra were analyzed following the standard procedure using iraf , which comprises bias subtraction , flat - field correction , co - addition of the three single exposures , wavelength calibration , and spectral extraction .",
    "the flat - field correction was made only in the red ( @xmath36 6,300  ) part of each spectrum due to the low response of the calibration lamp in the blue part .",
    "spectral calibration was conducted using 32 he - ar and ne arc lines that we obtained at the beginning of the night in the wavelength range @xmath6 @xmath7 4,0007,500  , and the rms uncertainty in the wavelength calibration was @xmath7 0.06  .",
    "the fwhm of the lines , which is equivalent to the intrinsic spectral resolution of the osiris spectrograph , increases from @xmath7  6.0   at 4,000   to @xmath7  7.6   at 7,500  .",

    "this estimation agrees with the extinction @xmath41  @xmath42 deduced from the empirical h@xmath25/h@xmath37 ratio @xcite where the quoted uncertainty includes contributions from those in line intensity measurement and dust models .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows the spectrum of the counterpart 2xmm j011942.7 + 032421  which is wavelength rest - framed and also extinction corrected .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by numerous emission lines , including h balmer series , he lines ( both  and ) and forbidden lines of heavy elements , which overlie blue continuum emission .",

    "no meaningful velocity offset between the  ( @xmath64686  ) line and the other lines is identified as the former shows a 9.8 @xmath33 5.3 @xmath8shift from the h@xmath37 line , confirming that the ulx counterpart is indeed located in the host galaxy ngc 470 and , consequently , validating the x - ray luminosity measurement of the ulx ( see  1 ) .",
    "the 9.0 @xmath33 0.6   fwhm of the  line is significantly larger than those of the other isolated lines which have an average fwhm of 6.4 @xmath33 0.9   . in order to investigate the large linewidth of the  line",
    "further , we measure it in all of the three individual 900-s exposures to be 11.9 @xmath33 3.7 , 13.0 @xmath33 2.7 and 16.0 @xmath33 5.2  , consistently larger than those of the other lines .",
    "the increased uncertainties caused by the faintness of the signal in the individual exposures , however , make it impossible to check if the central velocity of the  line changes during the three exposures .",
    "note that all the isolated lines other than the  line have a fwhm compatible with the intrinsic spectral resolution of the osiris spectrograph ( see above ) . excluding the instrumental line width of 6.3   measured in an arc line at 4,400 ",

    "we use the continuum emission in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] to obtain its @xmath1 and @xmath2 magnitudes of 21.8 and 22.1 mag , respectively , after removing the line emission in the bands .",
    "the @xmath1 band magnitude is comparable to that from the sdss photometry , whereas the @xmath2 band magnitude is larger than the sdss result .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy in the @xmath2 band magnitudes to the contribution by the strong h@xmath25 emission of the source and also to the uncertainty resident in photometric calibration of spectroscopic observations .",
    "the de - reddened absolute magnitudes of the optical counterpart in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands are 11.7 and 11.1 mag , respectively , after correction for its @xmath41  = 0.7 mag extinction .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the optical counterpart of 2xmm j011942.7 + 032421are approximately 100 times brighter than a single o - type star @xcite and are comparable to those of a more evolved star such as a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star or a luminous blue variable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or more likely an unresolved stellar cluster .",
    "as described in  2 , 2xmm j011942.7 + 032421  is located close to an  region in ngc  470 with small velocity offsets from other nearby  regions in spiral arms  which is indicative that it is related to star formation activities therein  and also from the nucleus of the host galaxy .",
    "this makes it highly unlikely that the source is a product of disruption of a satellite galaxy by the host galaxy or a merge of satellite galaxies @xcite as suggested for the hyper - luminous ulx eso 243 - 49 showing @xmath46 400 @xmath8  velocity shift from its nucleus @xcite .",
    "the absence of significant dynamic motions other than the large velocity dispersion in the  emission also makes it unlikely that the source is a recoiling supermassive black hole @xcite . and",
    "its @xmath10 300 x - ray ( 0.58 kev range ) to optical ( @xmath47 band ) flux ratio , computed by the method in @xcite , is much larger than the typical value , i.e. , @xmath22 10 , found in active galactic nuclei @xcite , while it is lower than the value , @xmath3 500 , found in eso 243 - 49 @xcite , supporting the interpretation that the source is unlikely associated with a supermassive black hole .",
    "as observed in cygnus x-3 and ngc 300 x-1 @xcite , wr stars accreting onto a compact object have shown high x - ray luminosities up to @xmath10 10@xmath48 @xmath5 , and @xcite suggested that m101 ulx-1 is a binary system of a wr star and a black hole of 2030 @xmath13 .",
    "however , it is less likely that the optical counterpart of 2xmm j011942.7 + 032421  is a wr star accreting onto a compact object since we do not see any spectral signature , e.g. , broad emission lines indicating significant mass loss , of a wr star ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "other possibilities for the origin of the optical continuum emission of 2xmm j011942.7 + 032421include an unresolved stellar cluster or irradiate disc emission as often found in other ulxs .",
    "one notable feature in the spectrum of the source is the  ( @xmath64686  ) line which is known to be often produced by strong x - ray photoionization , including those from ulxs ( e.g. , moon et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the presence of the  emission also supports that it is a real optical counterpart to 2xmm j011942.7 + 032421 . at the distance of 33.5 mpc ,",
    "the de - reddend luminosity of the  emission is @xmath10 1.4 @xmath11 10@xmath12 ergs s@xmath49 , corresponding to the x - ray ( 0.112 kev ) to  luminosity ratio of @xmath10 5.7 @xmath11 10@xmath50 .",
    "this makes 2xmm j011942.7 + 032421  one of the most luminous ulxs observed in the  emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : heii ] , which compares the spatial distribution of the emission with that of the nearby h@xmath37 emission , shows that the former is a bit more centrally concentrated than the latter  the fwhm of the  emission is @xmath7 1 , whereas that of h@xmath51 is @xmath7 1 .",
    "the size of the h@xmath37 emission is substantially greater than the seeing size ( @xmath10 1  in average ) and also the size of the  emission .",
    "the size of the  emission , however , is not much different from the seeing size , and it is uncertain if the former is indeed greater than the latter . if the large @xmath7 410 @xmath8  velocity dispersion of the  emission (  2 ) is due to the rotation of a photoionized accretion disc around the x - ray source as suggested for other ulxs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the size of an area where the majority of the  emission originates is @xmath10 @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the gravitational constant , mass and velocity dispersion , respectively .",
    "this gives @xmath7 0.055 au for the mass range of 101,000 @xmath13 , which is in fact much smaller than the seeing size .",
    "note that the h@xmath37 emission dose not show any apparent velocity dispersion (  2 ) , and it is in a different dynamic motion from .",
    "we thus conclude the linear size of the h@xmath37 emission to be 260  pc corresponding to 1 , while the  emission is unresolved .",
    "this is consistent with what have been observed in other ulxs where large ( @xmath3 100 pc ) emission nebulae show more extended emission in h@xmath37 than  @xcite . in particular , the ulx ho ix x-1 at 3.6 mpc shows an unresolved central  emission of @xmath7 370 @xmath8   velocity dispersion surrounded by diffuse  emission as well as by strong unevenly - distributed h@xmath37 emission . at an about 10 times larger distance , the  emission of ho ix x-1 may appear as that of 2xmm j011942.7 + 032421  presented in this study .",
    "2xmm j011942.7 + 032421  is one of the most luminous ulxs with its x - ray luminosities reaches up to @xmath10 1.5 @xmath11 10@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "using the sdss data , we discovered its optical countepart near an  region in a spiral arm of the host galaxy ngc  470 , and our optical spectrum of the source shows blue continuum embedded with numerous emission lines such as h recombinations , forbidden transitions , and most notably high - ionization  line at the same velocity of the host galaxy , validating the high x - ray luminosity of the ulx and confirming its optical conterpart .",
    "the absence of any significant dynamic motion , other than the large velocity dispersion of the  emission , of the source identified in the optical spectrum indicates that it is less likely associated with disruption or merge of satellite galaxies or motion of a supermassive black hole",
    ". the unresolved  emission of @xmath7 410 @xmath8  velocity dispersion , which is consistent with what have been observed in other ulxs , most likely represents a compact ( @xmath9 5 au ) photoionized accretion disc rotating the central x - ray source .",
    "the large optical luminosity suggests that the source may be an unresolved stellar cluster .",

    "<S> we present the identification and characterization of the optical counterpart to 2xmm j011942.7 + 032421 , one of the most luminous and distant ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the counterpart is located near a star forming region in a spiral arm of the galaxy ngc  470 with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 magnitudes of 21.53 , 21.69 , and 21.71 mags , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity of the counterpart is much larger than that of a single o - type star , indicating that it may be a stellar cluster . </S>",
    "<S> our optical spectroscopic observations confirm the association of the x - ray source and the optical counterpart with its host galaxy ngc  470 , which validates the high , @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 , x - ray luminosity of the source . </S>",
    "<S> its optical spectrum is embedded with numerous emission lines , including h recombination lines , metallic forbidden lines and more notably the high - ionization  ( @xmath64686  ) line . </S>",
    "<S> this line shows a large velocity dispersion of @xmath7 410 @xmath8 , consistent with the existence of a compact ( @xmath9 5 au ) highly - ionized accretion disc rotating around the central x - ray source . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath10 1.4 @xmath11 10@xmath12 @xmath5  luminosity of the  line emission makes the source one of the most luminous ulxs in the emission of that line . </S>",
    "<S> this , together with the high x - ray luminosity and the large velocity dispersion of the  emission , suggests that the source is an ideal candidate for more extensive follow - up observations for understanding the nature of hyper - luminous x - ray sources , a more luminous subgroup of ulxs and more likely candidates for intermediate - mass black holes . </S>"
