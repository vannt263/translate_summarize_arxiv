    "the use of vipt @xcite in the calculation of slope and curvature of isgur - wise(i - w ) function is very recent.in a qcd inspired potential model , we have two options in using vipt @xcite with the linear cum coulomb potential of qcd@xcite -(i ) coulombic one as the parent , the linear one as the perturbation and ( ii ) linear one as the parent , coulombic one as the perturbation.already,coulombic part as parent has been analyzed@xcite succesfully taking into account of three terms in the summation of equation(10 ) of ref 1 for @xmath0 mesons .however , the results were shown to be improved only with more terms in the equation(10 ) of ref 1.in this work , we take an alternate strategy : we take the linear potential as the parent and see any modification over the results of earlier work@xcite for the same three number of terms of equation(10)in that work .",
    "we recall that @xcite for the linear potential to be dominant we prefer @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is the expectation value of the distance @xmath4 which reasonably gives the size of a state(in this case meson ) and @xmath3 is a point at which linear cum coulomb potential becomes zero ( fig.1 of aitchison and dudek , ref [ 3 ] ) .in this work we have also included the @xmath5 mesons which have greater reduced mass @xmath6 , to check the range of applicability of the approach . + the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 contains the formalism , section 3 the result and calculation while section 4 includes the discussion and conclusion .",
    "the isgur - wise function is written as @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 being the four velocity of the heavy meson before and after the decay.the quantity @xmath11 is the slope of i - w function at @xmath12 and known as charge radius : @xmath13 the second order derivative is the curvature of the i - w function known as convexity parameter : @xmath14 for the heavy - light flavor mesons the i - w function can also be written as @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 now the wavefunction @xmath17 of the hadronic system is determined by taking the linear as parent potential .",
    "+      the wavefunction corrected upto the first order of @xmath18 state is given by ( equation 10 of ref 1 ) : @xmath19 the energy corrected upto first order for the same state is : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the wavefunction and energy eigen values of the @xmath23 states which are orthonormal to @xmath18 state .the superscript@xmath24 means zeroeth order correction of the corresponding quantities .also , we note that @xmath25is the variational parameter and @xmath26 , @xmath27 are as defined in equation(9)of ref 1 .",
    "+ the summation in equation ( 7 ) above [ equation 10 of ref 1 ] , can include any number of @xmath28 states .in this work , we consider terms upto three states in the summation as was done ref[1 ] . +        as explained earlier , we take @xmath29 as the variational parameter instead of the physical parameter @xmath30 in the parent linear potential to write the hamiltonian as@xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 now , @xmath33 is the parent hamiltonian with the new parameter @xmath29 and @xmath34 is the perturbed hamiltonian with the same variational parameter @xmath29 instead of the physical parameter @xmath30 .",
    "+ we consider @xmath18 as @xmath35 state ( @xmath36,@xmath37 ) and in the summation of equation(7 ) [ equation(10 ) of ref 1 ] , we consider a single @xmath23state which is the @xmath38 state ( @xmath39,@xmath37 ) .",
    "+ we note that in the variational method , we are interested only in the @xmath40 dependence of the hamiltonian , and so @xmath41 in @xmath42 has no role to play in the calculation@xcite .",
    "+ the unperturbed wavefunctions with linear parent with appropriate boundary conditions are the airy functions given by @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 s are the zeroes of the airy function @xmath45 given by @xcite : @xmath46^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ ] ] and @xmath47 is the normalization constant . + as an illustration",
    ", we reproduce for @xmath48 states a few of the zeroes of the airy function in table 1 .",
    "+    .a few of the zeroes of airy function for @xmath48 states .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we note that in the present analysis , the slope and curvature increase with the inclusion of more terms in the summation of equation(7)in contrary to the case of coulombic parent@xcite , where with more terms the slope and curvature decreased.an analysis of table 6 also indicate that for a definite term , the slope has increased in the present work compared to ref[1],while for the curvature , the pattern is reversed i.e. it has decreased in the present case compared to ref[1].so , with only one term for the linear parent in equation(7),we can have comparable values for slope and curvature with other models and data [ table-7].this is undoubtably a great phenomenological advantage as involvement of more terms in equation(7 ) makes the calculation quite cumbersome which happened in ref[1].however , relativistic correction in this case also decrease the slope and curvature of isgur - wise function as observed earlier @xcite .",
    "+ to conclude , the present approach with the linear potential as the parent has provided much more improved results for the slope and specially curvature of the iw function within the qcd inspired potential model under study and appeared to be preferable over the one of ref[1 ] where the linear potential was considered as perturbation .",
