    "einstein s general theory of relativity has successfully passed many observational tests and is now a central paradigm in gravitation physics .",
    "general relativity explains such gravitational phenomena as the perihelion shift of mercury s orbit , gravitational lensing , redshift in the light spectrum from extragalactic objects , and so on .",
    "one of the most intriguing predictions of the theory is the existence of a spacetime region from which nothing can escape , i.e. , a black hole .",
    "it has been considered that black holes are formed from the gravitational collapse in the last stage of heavy stars life or in high - density regions of the density perturbations in the early universe .",
    "the first analytic model of black - hole formation in general relativity was obtained by oppenheimer and snyder in 1939 , which represents the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of a homogeneous dust cloud in asymptotically flat vacuum spacetime  @xcite . in this spacetime ,",
    "the singularity formed is spacelike and hidden inside the black - hole event horizon , so that it is not visible to any observer .",
    "however , it was shown later that this is not a typical model and the singularities formed in generic collapse are _ naked _ , i.e. , observable  @xcite .",
    "in general relativity , it was proven that spacetime singularities inevitably appear in general situations and under physical energy conditions  @xcite .",
    "gravitational collapse is one of the presumable scenarios in which singularities are formed . where a naked singularity exists , the spacetime is not globally hyperbolic , so that the future predictability of the spacetime breaks down . in this context ,",
    "penrose proposed the _ cosmic censorship hypothesis _ ( cch ) , which prohibits the formation of naked singularities in gravitational collapse of physically reasonable matters with generic regular initial data  @xcite .",
    "the weak version of cch prohibits only the formation of globally naked singularities , i.e. , those which can be seen by an observer at infinity . if the weak cch is correct , singularities formed in generic gravitational collapse are hidden inside black holes , and the future predictability of the spacetime outside the black - hole event horizon is guaranteed . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong version of cch prohibits the formation of locally naked singularities also , which can be seen by some local observer .",
    "the strong cch asserts the future predictability of the whole spacetime , i.e. , global hyperbolicity of the spacetime .",
    "the cch is one of the most attractive and important unsolved problems in gravitation physics .",
    "validity of the cch is assumed in the many strong theorems such as the black - hole uniqueness theorem or the positive energy theorem in asymptotically flat spacetime . at present , however , the general proof of the cch is far from complete . on the contrary , there are many counterexample `` candidates '' in general relativity .",
    "( see  @xcite for a review . )",
    "the formation of a singularity means that a spacetime region with infinitely high curvature can be realized in the very final stage of gravitational collapse .",
    "it is naturally considered that quantum effects of gravity can not be neglected in such regions , so that the classical theory of gravity can not be applied there .",
    "therefore , naked singularities give us a chance to observe the quantum effects of gravity . from this point of view , harada and",
    "nakao proposed a concept named the _ spacetime border _ , which is the spacetime region where",
    "classical theories of gravity can not be applied  @xcite .",
    "the spacetime border is an effective `` singularity '' in classical theory , and then the cch can be naturally modified to more a practical version , which prohibits the formation of naked spacetime borders .",
    "if the modified cch is true , spacetime regions where quantum effects of gravity dominate are never observed . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is violated , there is a possibility in principle for us to observe such regions and obtain information useful to the construction of the quantum theory of gravity , which is still incomplete . from this point of view",
    ", studies of the final fate of gravitational collapse are quite important .    up to now , many quantum theories of gravity have been proposed . among them , superstring / m - theory is the most promising candidate and has been intensively investigated , which predicts higher - dimensional spacetime ( more than four dimensions ) . in this theory ,",
    "when the curvature radius of the central high - density region in gravitational collapse is comparable with the compactification radius of extra dimensions , the effects of extra dimensions will be important .",
    "such regions can be modeled effectively by higher - dimensional gravitational collapse .",
    "a recent attractive proposal for a new picture of our universe , which is called the braneworld universe  @xcite , is based on superstring / m - theory  @xcite . in the braneworld universe",
    ", we live on a four - dimensional timelike hypersurface embedded in the higher - dimensional bulk spacetime .",
    "because the fundamental scale could be around the tev scale in this scenario , the braneworld suggests that the creation of tiny black holes in the upcoming high - energy collider is possible  @xcite . from this point of view ,",
    "the effects of superstring / m - theory on black holes or gravitational collapse should be investigated .",
    "however , the non - perturbative aspects of superstring / m - theory are not understood completely so far , although the progress in recent years has been remarkable . given the present circumstances , taking their effects perturbatively into classical gravity is one possible approach to studying the quantum effects of gravity .",
    "the gauss - bonnet term in the lagrangian is the higher curvature correction to general relativity and naturally arises as the next leading order of the @xmath7-expansion of heterotic superstring theory , where @xmath7 is the inverse string tension  @xcite .",
    "such a theory is called the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity .    in a previous paper ,",
    "the author presented a model of the @xmath8-dimensional spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of a null dust fluid in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the spacetime structure of the gravitational collapse differs greatly between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in five dimensions , massive timelike naked singularities",
