    "the description of very compact astrophysical objects has been a key issue in relativistic astrophysics for the past decades .",
    "recent observations suggest that there are many compact objects such as x - ray pulsar her x-1 , x - ray burster 4u 1820 - 30 , millisecond pulsar sax j 1808.4 - 3658 , x - ray sources 4u 1728 - 34 , psr 0943 + 10 and rx j185635 - 3754 , whose estimated masses and radii are not compatible with the standard neutron star models .",
    "the conjecture that quark matter might be the true ground state of hadrons @xcite , inspired many authors to describe such stars as strange stars @xcite , quark - diquark stars @xcite , hybrid stars @xcite and boson / boson - fermion stars @xcite .",
    "as densities of such compact objects are normally above nuclear matter density , theoretical studies suggest that pressures within such stars are likely to be anisotropic , i.e. , at the interior of such stars there are two different kinds of pressures , viz . , the radial pressure and the tangential pressure @xcite . different solutions of einstein s field equations for anisotropic fluid distribution with spheroidal geometry , with varying forms of the energy density , have been obtained by many workers @xcite .",
    "so far , the role of pressure anisotropy has been extensively studied in the context of high redshift values and stability of compact objects ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "bowers and liang @xcite have pointed out that anisotropy may also change the limiting values of the maximum mass of compact stars . the objective of the present work is to investigate the role of pressure anisotropy on the maximum masses of compact objects . to this end , in  2 , we modify a solution obtained by mukherjee _",
    "et al _ @xcite to incorporate anisotropy .",
    "the class of solutions , capable of describing cold compact stars , was obtained by using an ansatz given by vaidya and tikekar @xcite . for physically relevant anisotropic stars , the regularity and matching conditions for the solutions are developed . in ",
    "3 we discuss the role of anisotropy and calculate the maximum possible masses for this class of solutions in  4 .",
    "we conclude by summarizing our results in  5 .",
    "we take the line element for a static spherically symmetric cold compact star in the standard form @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the two unknown metric functions . assuming the energy momentum tensor for an anisotropic star in the most general form @xmath4 the field equations are obtained as @xmath5 where we have set @xmath6 . in ( [ eq3])-([eq5 ] ) , @xmath7 is the energy density , @xmath8 is the radial pressure , @xmath9 is the tangential pressure and @xmath10 is the measure of pressure anisotropy in this model . to solve this system we use the ansatz @xcite @xmath11",
    "then ( [ eq5 ] ) takes the form @xmath12 to solve ( [ eq7 ] ) we assume that the form of the anisotropic parameter @xmath10 is @xmath13 and if we make a further transformation @xmath14 , ( [ eq7 ] ) becomes @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a constant .",
    "this has the general solution ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath17}{\\beta+1}}-{\\frac { \\cos [ ( \\beta-1)\\zeta + \\delta]}{\\beta-1}}\\bigg ] \\label{eq9}\\ ] ] where , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constants which can be determined from the boundary conditions . the physical parameters in this model are then obtained as @xmath22 \\label{eq10},\\\\ p_{r } & = & - { 1 \\over r^2 ( 1-z^2 ) } \\bigg [ 1 + { 2z \\psi_{z}\\over ( \\lambda + 1 ) \\psi } \\bigg ] \\label{eq11},\\\\ p_{\\perp } & = & p_{r } + \\delta \\label{eq12},\\\\ \\delta & = & { \\alpha\\lambda \\over r^2 } \\bigg [ { ( \\lambda + 1)(1 - z^2 ) - 1 \\over ( \\lambda + 1)^2(1 - z^2)^2 } \\bigg ] , \\label{eq13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which together with ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) comprise an exact solution to the einstein field equations .",
    "note that @xmath23 is the total mass of a star of radius @xmath24 .",
    "we impose the following conditions in our model :    * at the boundary of the star the interior solution should be matched with the schwarzschild exterior solution , i.e. , @xmath25 * the radial pressure @xmath8 should vanish at the boundary of the star which gives @xmath26 where @xmath27 . from ( [ eq9 ] ) we have @xmath28-\\sin[(\\beta+1)\\zeta + \\delta]}{(\\beta+1)\\cos[(\\beta-1)\\zeta + \\delta]-(\\beta-1)\\cos[(\\beta+1)\\zeta + \\delta]}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq17}\\ ] ] combining ( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) we obtain @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "* @xmath32 inside the star gives @xmath33 * using ( [ eq10])-([eq12 ] ) we get @xmath34 .",
    "\\label{eq21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we choose the parameters so that the causality conditions are not violated , i.e. , @xmath35 in this model .",
    "the above conditions are imposed for a physically reasonable model .",
    "it was shown earlier by sharma _ et al _ @xcite that the vaidya - tikekar model provides a simple method of studying systematically the maximum mass problem of compact isotropic ( @xmath36 ) stars . to see the effect of anisotropy ( @xmath37 ) in this model",
    ", we may adopt the following methods .",
    "we may choose the isotropic compactness @xmath38 and @xmath39 as input parameters and using ( [ eq14 ] ) calculate @xmath40 .",
    "for a given central or surface density , ( [ eq10 ] ) can be used to calculate the value of @xmath41 which then determines the radius @xmath42 or mass @xmath43 ( from ( [ eq14 ] ) ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is fixed by choosing a specific value of @xmath44 . since mass and radius",
    "are fixed , this method is not suitable to analyze the role of anisotropy on the maximum mass problem .",
    "however , ( [ eq20 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) can be utilized to show that for stars with the same masses and radii may have different anisotropic compositions if the equations of state are modified accordingly . in ",
    "3.1 , we consider two such examples to show how the composition may change in the presence of anisotropy .",
    "note that the variations of the slopes of @xmath45 and @xmath46 may correspond to different material compositions within the star .",
    "these variations are shown in figure [ fg1 ] and figure [ fg2 ] .    to see the effect of anisotropy on the compactness",
    ", we adopt a different approach .",
    "note that ( [ eq18 ] ) is a relation between @xmath47 and @xmath21 which we will utilize to calculate @xmath21 for given values of @xmath44 and @xmath39 . for given values of @xmath39 and @xmath48 , we first calculate @xmath47 using ( [ eq14 ] ) . substituting these values in ( [ eq18 ] ) , we determine @xmath21 for the isotropic case ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "once @xmath21 is determined , we use this value to calculate @xmath50 for different @xmath44 values .",
    "we then use the relation @xmath51 to see the effect of anisotropy on the compactness of a star .      following the method discussed above ,",
    "we have obtained numerical results showing the effect of anisotropy on some physically relevant parameters .",
    "two different cases have been studied . +",
    "* case i : * we use our earlier data for the pulsar her x-1 @xcite and choose @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54  km so that @xmath55 and calculate the compactness for different anisotropic parameters . +",
    "* case ii : * we consider the millisecond pulsar sax j 1808.4 - 3658 and use the results obtained in an earlier work @xcite and choose @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58  km so that @xmath59 .",
    "we note that the compactness decreases with increasing anisotropy which is in agreement with earlier results obtained in @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 .",
    "the behaviour of the anisotropy factor ( @xmath60 ) in the stellar interior is shown in figure ( [ fg3 ] ) .     at the boundary and at the centre of an anisotropic star against @xmath44 .",
    "we took @xmath52 and @xmath61 .",
