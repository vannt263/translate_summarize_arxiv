    "the physics of small parahydrogen clusters is of interest because these few - body systems feature a rather unique interplay of classical and quantum physics.@xcite due to its low mass and bosonic character , parahydrogen ( 2 ) was predicted a long time ago to undergo a superfluid transition , at temperature @xmath3 6 k.@xcite however , the equilibrium phase of bulk 2 in the @xmath4 limit is a crystal , even in reduced dimensions,@xcite due to the depth of the attractive well of the interaction potential between two hydrogen molecules . the theoretical suggestion that a liquidlike phase of 2 could be stabilized in two dimensions ( 2d ) by an underlying impurity substrate@xcite",
    "is not supported by several subsequent calculations.@xcite + there is experimental evidence , on the other hand , that small droplets of 2 in three dimensions can escape crystallization,@xcite down to a temperature sufficiently low ( @xmath5 1 k ) that a finite superfluid response , defined as the dissipationless rotation about an axis going through the center of mass , is theoretically predicted to arise in nanoscale clusters ( @xmath6 molecules).@xcite .",
    "most of these clusters are expected to remain essentially liquidlike , i.e. , structureless , all the way to zero temperature , in some cases undergoing quantum melting at sufficiently low @xmath2 ; one of them , however , namely ( 2)@xmath7 , is predicted to retain some well - defined structural short - range order , even with the concurrent development of superfluid coherence at low @xmath2 , behaving in some sense as a finite - size ",
    "supersolid\".@xcite + an interesting question is what happens if clusters are themselves confined to 2d , which could be experimentally achieved for example by adsorbing a low - density 2 film on a suitable substrate , strong enough to confine molecules effectively to 2d , but also weak enough to allow for the neglect of corrugation .",
    "substrates of alkali metals might be a good candidate,@xcite but progress toward the stabilization of quasi-2d h@xmath8 clusters on a different type of substrate has been recently reported.@xcite reduction of dimensionality brings about two competing effects . on the one hand , the lower coordination number weakens the tendency to crystallize , but also has the effect of rendering less frequent quantum - mechanical exchanges of identical particles , which have been shown to play a crucial role in the stabilization of a liquidlike structure at low @xmath2.@xcite + the only existing theoretical study of 2 clusters in 2d is that by gordillo and ceperley , who carried out first principles path integral monte carlo simulations , down to @xmath9 k.@xcite their main physical findings were that clusters comprising at the most two concentric shells of molecules around the center of mass ( typically ten molecules or less ) are liquidlike and superfluid at low @xmath2 ( @xmath10 k ) ; as more molecules are added to the cluster , a solidlike core starts forming , with the concomitant , gradual suppression of the superfluid response . from this observation , the authors inferred that , as cluster size is increased , superfluidity is progressively confined to a liquidlike outer shell , while the solidlike core is insulating .",
    "+ in this paper , we present results of quantum monte carlo simulations of 2d 2 clusters of size ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath11 molecules at low temperature ( down to 0.25 k ) .",
    "we computed energetic and superfluid properties of the clusters , and investigated their structure by means of density profiles computed with respect to the center of mass of the cluster , as well as through actual density maps , affording direct visual insight in 2d .",
    "+ our estimates of the energy per 2 molecule are in excellent quantitative agreement with those of ref .",
    "; on the other hand , we obtain a stronger superfluid signal than they do , especially for clusters with more than @xmath12 molecules .",
    "indeed , we find a robust superfluid signal at the lowest temperature considered here , for clusters comprising as many as @xmath1 2 molecules .",
    "analogously to what observed in three - dimensional ( 3d ) clusters , the dependence of the superfluid response on @xmath13 is non - monotonic.@xcite + more importantly , the physical picture that emerges from our study is qualitatively different from that of ref . in a number of relevant aspects .",
    "first and foremost , none of the clusters studied here can be regarded as truly  liquidlike \" , at low @xmath2 . in particular , our radial density profiles for the smaller clusters",
    "are quantitatively very different from those of ref .",
    ", featuring much higher peaks , separated in turn by much more pronounced dips .",
    "this is indicative of a well - defined structure , in which molecules tend to occupy preferred lattice positions , something that is confirmed by our computed density maps .",
    "second , the calculation of the local superfluid density shows that in all superfluid clusters the response is not confined at the surface but rather uniform throughout the system , much like in 3d clusters.@xcite thus , no meaningful distinction can be drawn between a non - superlfuid , solidlike center , and a superfluid liquidlike outer part , for any of the superfluid clusters ; rather , they should be regarded as featuring concurrently superfluid and solidlike properties . in this sense , these small 2d clusters may be regarded as naturally occurring nanoscale  supersolids \" .",

    "[ results ] to a thorough illustration of our results , discussing the physical conclusions in sec . [ conclusions ] ,",
    "in which we also describe some possible scenarios for the stabilization of a bulk superfluid phase of 2 in 2d .",
    "our system of interest is modeled as a collection of @xmath13 parahydrogen ( 2 ) molecules , regarded as point particles , moving in two physical dimensions .",

    ", we made use of silvera - goldman potential,@xcite mostly for consistency with the calculation@xcite of ref . .",

    "we use a high - temperature approximation for the imaginary time propagator accurate to fourth order@xcite in the imaginary time step @xmath20 .",
    "the results shown here are obtained with a value of @xmath21 k@xmath22 , empirically found to yield estimates indistinguishable , within our quoted statistical uncertainties , from those extrapolated to the @xmath23 limit ( i.e the limit where the method becomes exact ) . + we compute both the global superfluid fraction @xmath24 , as well as the radial , angularly averaged one , @xmath25 .",

    "this is because the statistical noise in the estimate of @xmath24 arises mostly from contributions in the vicinity ( i.e. , within a distance @xmath29 or less ) of the center of mass .",

    "[ r20 ] ) . while a quantitative characterization of particle localization in these clusters might be obtained by making use of estimators proposed in refs .",
    ", nonetheless our results , consistently yielding higher peaks and more pronounced dips inbetween , seem to point rather clearly to a significantly more rigid , solidlike structure than that predicted in ref . .",

    "qualititative_. + we now discuss the superfluid properties . for all clusters with @xmath39 , the superfluid fraction @xmath40 is indistinguishable from 100% within statistical uncertainties at @xmath41 k. our superfluid signal is stronger than that reported in ref . for clusters with @xmath42 and 20 , for all of which they find",
    "is worth @xmath43 at @xmath2=0.33 k , whereas for these four specific clusters we find values in excess of 90% at that same temperature .",
    "the largest cluster for which a significantly large superfluid response is observed at the lowest temperature considered here , namely @xmath2=0.25 k , comprises 25 molecules ; its superfluid fraction is again worth approximately 100% at @xmath2=025 k. + the superfluid response is observed to drop abruptly for @xmath44 ; indeed , for none of the clusters with @xmath45 could we obtain an appreciable value of @xmath24 in this study , at the lowest temperature considered here .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath13 for a fixed low @xmath2 is not monotonic , a fact already observed in 3d clusters@xcite with @xmath46 .",
    "specifically , at @xmath2=0.25 k , @xmath24 is observed to drop down to level of statistical noise@xcite for a cluster with @xmath13=24 , to rebound to @xmath47 on adding a single molecule ( i.e. , for a cluster with @xmath13=25 ) , and to drop again to zero if another molecule is added .",

    "such an intriguing behaviour , most remarkably mimicking what observed in 3d clusters with the same numbers of molecules , can not be straightforwardly related to the shape of the cluster , and/or to the completion of any regular geometrical structure , occurring on adding a molecule to ( or removing one from ) a cluster with @xmath13=25 , nor to some greater  liquidlike \" character of the @xmath1 system .",
    "[ r256 ] compares density profiles for the two clusters with @xmath13=25 and 26 2 molecules at @xmath2=0.25 k , at which the cluster with 25 molecules is entirely superfluid , and that with 26 features no measurable superfluid response .",
    "both profiles show three peaks , i.e. , three concentric shells , but that of the the cluster with one extra molecule is noticeably more structured , and its first two peaks sharper . on the other hand , the peak corresponding to the outer shell is rather smooth , very similar in both cases .",
    "thus , the main structural difference between the two clusters seems to be that the non - superfluid one has enhanced solid order in the two inner shells .",
    "this observation , together with the fact that the superfluid response is uniformly distributed throughout the cluster , in turn undermines the suggestion that superfluidity should correlate with the presence of a liquidlike outer shell , of which no evidence is shown by the representative configuration snapshots of figures [ sn2 ] and [ sn3 ] .",
    "indeed , both clusters display a rather ordered structure , although the molecules sitting at the surface are obviously less bound .",
    "we have carried out a systematic investigation of the low temperature properties of small clusters of 2 in two dimensions , using first principle quantum monte carlo simulations , whose only input is the intermolecular pair potential .",
    "some of the physical properties of these clusters are very similar to those of clusters in three dimensions .",
    "for example , the non - monotonic dependence of the superfluid response at low temperature on the number @xmath13 of molecules in the cluster , is also observed in the 3d system . there too , most notably , the numbers @xmath13=25 and 26 are associated with the same effect observed here , i.e. , the drop of the superfluid fraction from nearly 100% to a value close to zero ( in the temperature range considered here ) , on adding a single molecule to the @xmath13=25 cluster .",
    "this suggests that a remarkable compensating effect takes place on reducing dimensionality ; the enhancement of quantum fluctuations , and the concomitant suppression of quantum - mechanical exchanges ( due to the confinement of molecular motion to a plane , and the hard , repulsive core of the intermolecular potential at short distances ) both contribute to preserve some of the same physics observed in three dimensions .",
    "+ on the other hand , some of the features of 2d 2 droplets set them aside from their 3d counterpart .",
    "the most striking feature of these few - body systems , is the simultaneous presence of what can be reasonably described as short - range order , whereby molecules tend to form specific geometrical arrangements , typically resulting from a classical mechanism ( i.e. , minimization of potential energy ) , and a finite superfluid response , originating from exchanges of identical molecules . much like in the 3d case ,",
    "superfluidity is underlain by cycles of exchanges involving all of the molecules , not just those on the outer shell .",
    "indeed , the participation of inner molecules to exchanges is crucial , witness the fact that as the number @xmath13 is increased beyond 25 , at which point the superfluid response of the clusters is significantly suppressed , their inner structure concurrently appears much more rigid ( as shown by the comparison in fig .",
    "[ r256 ] ) , consistently with inner molecules to be more localized and less involved in exchanges .",
    "+ what are the implications of this study , if any , regarding a possible stabilization of a superfluid phase of bulk 2 ?",
    "the suggestion that one might be able to use frustration , either arising from disorder@xcite or from an underlying impurity substrate incommensurate with the equilibrium triangular crystalline phase of 2 in two dimension,@xcite has not been shown to lead to a superfluid phase , although recently renewed claims to that effect have been made.@xcite + an alternative approach could borrow on ideas arising from theoretical studies of superfluidity ( and supersolidity ) in cold atom assemblies.@xcite specifically , one could imagine patterning a suitably chosen surface with regularly arranged adsorption sites ( e.g. , on a triangular lattice ) .",
    "each site could be designed to accommodate a number of 2 molecules between , say , ten and twenty , acting in a sense as a  molecular quantum dot \" , turning superfluid at low @xmath2 . conceivably , upon choosing the lattice constant of the adsorption lattice suitably",
    ", it might be possible to establish phase coherence throughout the whole system , through the tunnelling of individual 2 molecules across adjacent adsorption wells .",
    "the ensuing superfluid phase would be similar to the supersolid droplet crystal phase of refs . and , with the important conceptual difference that in the present case the adsorption lattice is externally imposed , as opposed to arising from inter - particle interactions .",
