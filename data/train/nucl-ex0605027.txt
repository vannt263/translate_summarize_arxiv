    "in order to probe the structure of low energy nuclear isomeric states whose surroundings can substantially influence the properties of the state @xcite , it has become necessary to develop a means of performing measurements in a medium - free environment .",
    "the method described here implements the ion - guide isotope separator on - line technique conceived @xcite , developed @xcite and successfully used at the university of jyvskyl for over 20 years . in the technique",
    ", nuclear reaction products are thermalised in fast flowing helium gas and are extracted as ions through an exit hole for injection into a mass separator .",
    "the jyvskyl igisol system has recently been upgraded , both in general design @xcite in order to handle higher primary beam currents and in post - gas cell ion guidance .",
    "this latter upgrade has resulted in the installation of a radio - frequency sextupole ion guide which replaces the skimmer system based on previous tests in jyvskyl @xcite and elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the rf - sextupole has the advantage of a higher overall mass resolution and better transmission efficiency .",
    "a laser ion source has also recently been developed @xcite based upon resonance ionisation in a gas cell @xcite and variations thereof @xcite .",
    "developments in ion guide technology @xcite have shown that the addition of in - guide electric fields improves the extraction efficiency and reduces the evacuation time of radioactive ions .    in this work two electric field arrangements",
    "have been designed and tested for the evacuation of daughter recoils originating from a @xmath2u source inside a large volume gas cell .",
    "firstly , a standard electrostatic field has been modeled and tested employing charged stainless steel plates close to the guide exit hole based upon an earlier design @xcite .",
    "secondly , an electron emitter design @xcite has been tested , whereby a potential difference is created in the guide via a source of electrons close to the exit hole .",
    "the ion guide dimensions are specifically designed to maximise the production of a radioactive ion beam of @xmath3th dictated by the shape and @xmath1-recoil energy of the source . moreover , the guide is adaptable to any @xmath1-recoil source and is fully compatible with both the new laser ion source and rf - sextupole ion guide .",
    "the dimensions of the ion guide were chosen so that the maximum range of 84 kev @xmath1-recoils in 50 mbar he gas ( 10 mm ) was smaller than the guide radius ( 57.5 mm ) .",
    "the source of @xmath3th was produced ( eq .",
    "[ beta ] ) through neutron capture and subsequent @xmath7 decay of unstable nuclei from a seed nucleus of @xmath8th .",
    "this source was supplied by isotope products laboratory , bubank , usa .    @xmath9    the @xmath2u parent was dissolved in isopropanol and chemically electroplated onto 12 stainless steel sheets with dimensions 76.2 mm @xmath10 25.4 mm .",
    "these strips were then mounted on the inside surface of the gas cell defining its diameter to be 115 mm .",
    "u foil taken over a 10 minute collection time . ]",
    "the strength of the source supplied was measured through analysis of its @xmath1-spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] ) .",
    "the dominant @xmath1-decay peak arising from the decay of @xmath2u to @xmath3th was fitted yielding a source strength of 10@xmath11 bq .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] shows a magnified portion of the spectrum where alpha peaks relating to decays lower in the decay chain have been identified .",
    "table [ tab : sourcea ] lists the alpha energy and corresponding isotope of these peaks .",
    "the presence of decays from the @xmath8th chain indicates a population of impurities not fully suppressed in the extraction of @xmath2u from the breeder reactor .",
    ".alpha peak energies and origin in the source @xmath1-spectrum . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in an attempt to reduce the formation of @xmath3tho@xmath4 inside the rf - cooler , the bunching time as a function of @xmath3tho@xmath4/@xmath3th@xmath4 ratio was investigated and is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure11 ] .",
    "an exponential growth fit to the data of the form    @xmath12    was applied , whereby @xmath13 is the intrinsic switchyard to trap transmission efficiency and @xmath14 is a time constant for the formation of @xmath3tho@xmath4 inside the cooler @xcite .",
    "tho@xmath4/@xmath3th@xmath4 ratio as a function of cooler bunching time normalised to the standard bunching time of 660 ms .",
    "]    this yielded an intrinsic switchyard to trap transmission efficiency of 32 @xmath15 14% and a molecular formation time constant of 0.39(7 ) s for @xmath3tho@xmath4 production in the cooler .",
    "this indicates that the impurity concentration level is 4.3 @xmath10 10@xmath16@xmath17 assuming a reaction rate for production of @xmath3tho@xmath4 identical to that of the reaction th@xmath4 + o@xmath18tho@xmath4 + o @xcite .",
    "this impurity concentration is comparable to the stated water contaminant abundance of the buffer gas .",
    "the possibility of molecular formation inside the purification trap was not studied here .",
    "+ accumulation of bunches on a timescale shorter than the reaction time constant inside the cooler improves the bare transmission efficiency of @xmath3th@xmath4 , but the intrinsic efficiency is unavoidable and is the main loss mechanism between the switchyard and experimental stations . accounting for transmission losses between the ion guide and penning trap , the overall @xmath3th@xmath4 extraction efficiency is estimated at 0.06% of the source strength .",
    "missing efficiency arises through molecular formation inside the ion guide ( table [ tab : mols ] ) and due to an unknown fraction of neutral @xmath3th @xmath1-recoils and molecules thereof .",
    "the neutral @xmath3th atomic fraction may be accessed via resonant laser ionisation @xcite in the future .",
    "the testing of differing electric field arrangements in this study has shown that a large potential gradient at large distances from the source of an electric field is best achieved through injection of electrons into a gas cell .",
    "this large potential difference directly contributes to both the ion guide efficiency for extraction of @xmath1-recoils and reduction in extraction time of short lived ions .",
    "an ion guide efficiency for the extraction of @xmath3th@xmath19-recoils is reduced compared to that of @xmath5fr@xmath4 , @xmath20rn@xmath4 and @xmath6at@xmath4 and can be attributed to a combination of source geometry , chemical effects and an unknown neutral atom population .",
    "a @xmath3th@xmath4 beam has been successfully extracted but impurity molecules restrict the bare ion fraction , most likely in favour of forming water and oxide compounds .",
    "delivery of the ion beam to experimental stations is also reduced by the intrinsic transmission efficiency of the system , but formation of molecules inside the cooler can be almost eliminated by an appropriate choice of bunching time . a rate of 50 s@xmath21 @xmath3th ions at experimental stations has been achieved and a series of experiments using this newly available beam will follow .",
    "this will begin with collinear laser spectroscopy studies on the ground state and predicted low - lying isomeric state in @xmath3th .",
    "the authors would like to thank a. nieminen for his contribution to the design of the ion guide .",
