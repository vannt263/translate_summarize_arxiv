    "in an earlier paper we showed that symmetry breaking could be induced in the triiodide ion by varying the solvent @xcite .",
    "experiments and simulations @xcite suggest that protic solvents which can form hydrogen bonds with a negative ion cause symmetry breaking of the ion , so that the charge becomes concentrated at one end of the ion and the corresponding bond elongates .",
    "we suggested that one could draw an analogy between the mean field ising model with free energy @xmath2 and solvent induced symmetry breaking with @xmath3 in these expressions @xmath4 is the landau free energy per molecule ( or per spin ) , @xmath5 is an order parameter and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are coefficients @xcite .",
    "the ising model has a critical point when the temperature @xmath8 reaches @xmath9 ; below this temperature the symmetry is broken to give domains with non - zero order parameters , while above this temperature the order parameter is equal to zero .",
    "various critical phenomena , such as vanishing of the susceptibility and diverging fluctuations in the order parameter , are observed as the critical point is approached . as these mean - field critical phenomena result from the form of the equation for the free energy , it is interesting to see whether there are corresponding phenomena in the solvent - induced symmetry breaking . in this paper",
    "we describe an investigation of this point . in order to vary the solvent strength in a systematic way we used a series of modified waters as solvents .",
    "the models are based on the standard spc / e model with a lennard - jones center on the oxygen atom and charges on the atomic sites .",
    "the charges are scaled by a factor @xmath0 which varies from unity , giving the standard spc / e model which we know causes strong symmetry - breaking , to zero , giving a pure lennard - jones solvent which our earlier work shows does not cause symmetry breaking .",
    "thus varying @xmath0 provides a method of tuning the solvent strength @xmath10 through the critical value @xmath11 .",
    "the model for triiodide ion is the same as used in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of the ion is described using a semi - empirical valence bond model based on diatomics in molecules method @xcite with additional terms due to the fact that the species is charged @xcite .",
    "provided the ion is constrained to be linear , its ground state is described by a @xmath13 hamiltonian matrix , whose matrix elements depend on the instantaneous values of the bond lengths and the instantaneous external electrostatic potential due to the solvent .",
    "full details are given in the appendix to reference @xcite .",
    "the solvent molecules are rigid three - site models based on spc / e water @xcite , with partial charges on all three atomic sites and lennard - jones interactions on the oxygen site .",
    "the total energy of the system can be written as @xmath14 where the first term is the quantum mechanical energy of the ground state , with @xmath15 being the hamiltonian matrix element between basis states @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 the coefficient of basis state @xmath16 in the ground state .",
    "the second and third terms are sums of the electrostatic and lennard - jones interactions over all pairs of solvent sites @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and the last term is the sum of lennard - jones interactions between solvent sites and iodine atomic sites @xmath21 .    quantum mechanical forces on both iodine and solvent sites were calculated using the hellman - feynman theorem , while the forces arising from the three classical terms in equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) were calculated in the usual way within the molecular dynamics program .",
    "the ion was constrained to be linear throughout .",
    "the solvent molecules were based on the standard spc / e model for a water molecule @xcite with a lennard - jones center on the oxygen and charges on the atomic sites . in spc / e water hydrogen bonds and all other orientational correlations",
    "are due solely to electrostatic interactions between molecules .",
    "thus the hydrogen - bond strength can be controlled by scaling the charges . in this study ,",
    "nine solvent models were used with the charges were scaled by a factor @xmath0 which varied from 1.125 , giving a super strong water , through 1 , giving the standard spc / e model , to zero , giving a pure lennard - jones solvent .",
    "the lennard - jones potential between the iodine and oxygen sites was the same as used in our previous work with water @xcite .",
    "the lennard - jones parameters and the partial charges for sites are given in table [ tab : params ] .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using a version of the dlpoly program @xcite which was modified to include the construction and diagonalisation of the hamiltonian matrix and the calculation of the hellman - feynman forces .",
    "the simulation cell contained one triiodide ion and 509 modified water molecules in a cubic box with an edge - length of 24.8 .",
    "the density was the same for all simulations .",
    "simulations were carried out at 300k with a time step of 1 fs .",
    "for each value of the charge scaling constant , @xmath0 , the system was thoroughly equilibrated before collecting data for 1 ns . our earlier work showed that two order parameters were necessary to describe the symmetry breaking .",
    "the order parameters chosen are the molecular dipole moment @xmath22 ( relative to the center of mass ) and the normal coordinate for the antisymmetric stretch @xmath23 . the former measures the extent of electronic distortion , while the latter measures the geometrical distortion .",
    "the instantaneous values of these parameters were determined at each time step , and averages , mean square fluctuations and probability histograms were constructed .      from the two - dimensional histograms for the probability distributions of the two order parameters ,",
    "the shannon information entropy function @xmath24 was constructed for each bin @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the probability of being in that bin , with @xmath27 .",
    "the shannon entropy of the system @xcite is then @xmath28 we show in the appendix that the limit of this sum as the bin sizes tend to zero is a property of the system , rather than of our information about it , and is the entropy associated with the spread of order parameter values . in our calculations the bin sizes used were @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the values of the bin sizes affect the zero of entropy , but , as they were kept constant for all the simulations , entropy differences between runs are real although absolute values are arbitrary .",
    "figure [ fig : hdis ] shows the distribution of the shannon entropy function @xmath24 for selected values of @xmath0 . when @xmath0 is small there is a single maximum while when lambda is large enough two maxima are seen .",
    "figure [ fig : hcross ] shows cross sections through this @xmath31 surface for all the runs .",
    "the direction of cross section is different for each @xmath0 and is either chosen to go through the two maxima , or , when there is only a single maximum , it is chosen to go through the direction of minimum curvature .",
    "these figures show that there is symmetry breaking in the curve marked 4 ( @xmath32 ) and there is no symmetry breaking in the curve marked 3 ( @xmath33 ) thus the critical value of @xmath0 , @xmath34 , lies between these values , that is somewhat below @xmath32.these results confirm that varying the scaling parameter @xmath0 induces symmetry - breaking .",
    "there is no a - priori reason to identify @xmath0 as opposed to some function of @xmath0 with the solvent strength in the free energy equation ( [ eq : solfe ] ) .",
    "however figure [ fig : en ] shows the solvent - triiodide interaction energy ( lowest curve ) .",
    "the interaction energy decreases smoothly with the scaling factor @xmath0 and is approximately linear in the critical region .",
    "this figure also shows ( upper curve ) the energetic cost of polarising the ion .",
    "the inverse susceptibilities for the response to an external electric field @xmath35 is plotted in figure [ fig : simsus ] .",
    "it can be seen that there is a monotonic decrease in the inverse susceptibility as a function of the scaling factor @xmath0 , and that @xmath36 does not tend to zero near the critical value @xmath37 . in a second - order phase transition , however , inverse susceptibilities do tend to zero at the critical point .",
    "the shannon entropy , @xmath38 , would also be expected to show critical behavior at the critical point .",
    "figure [ fig : htot ] shows that in our system this quantity has a weak maximum at a value of @xmath0 which is slightly greater that the critical value @xmath34 , rather than diverging at @xmath34 .",
    "as the two figures [ fig : htot ] , and [ fig : simsus ] do not show the expected critical behavior near the critical value of the scaling constant , @xmath39 , we conclude that there is a difference between our system and the mean field ising model . in order to elucidate this difference",
    "we study the properties of a simple model .",
    "let us consider a simple model for symmetry breaking with a single order parameter @xmath5 and a landau free energy per molecule given by @xmath40 this can be rewritten ( by rescaling @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a measure of the relative strength of the solvent interaction .",
    "the critical point where symmetry breaking occurs is @xmath45 . in order to answer the question as to",
    "when one should observe critical phenomena such as diverging fluctuations , we examine the properties of the probability distribution of the order parameter @xmath46/z=\\exp[-\\beta    ( ( 1-\\rho ) \\eta^2/2 + \\eta^4/4)]/z   \\label{eq : prob}\\ ] ] as a function of the parameter @xmath17 . in this expression",

    "it can be seen that the shannon entropy has a maximum as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "as @xmath17 increases , this maximum gets sharper and shifts downwards towards @xmath45 .    for a second order phase transition",
    ", the inverse of the susceptibility @xmath50 , which is given by @xmath51 , tends to zero at the critical point where the phase transition occurs .",
    "the upper part of figure [ fig : sus ] shows the values of the inverse of the susceptibility of the model system as a function of @xmath49 for a range of values of the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "again we observe that if @xmath17 is large enough the inverse susceptibility decreases linearly towards a value of zero at @xmath52 .",
    "a simple calculation of the susceptibility above the critical value of @xmath49 is misleading as the probabilities of positive and negative values of the order parameter are equal and the mean value is always 0 .",
    "however if a small biassing field @xmath53 is added giving the free energy @xmath54 then the lower part of figure [ fig : sus ] shows that the inverse susceptibility increases with @xmath49 above the critical value @xmath45 .",
    "the results at large @xmath17 are very similar to those obtained from a mean field model of a second order phase transition with landau free energy @xmath55 in the standard treatment of this model @xcite , one is only concerned with the minima of the function .",
    "one finds that above the critical temperature @xmath9 the minimum of @xmath4 is at @xmath56 in the absence of an external field , while below @xmath9 the minima are at @xmath57 .",
    "the susceptibility is calculated from the change of the position of @xmath58 with the strength of the external field , @xmath59 .",
    "this gives @xmath60 it will be noted that the standard treatment does not include fluctuations in the order parameter , while the expression that we have used ( equation [ eq : prob ] ) gives the full range of possible values .",
    "the reason that one can ignore fluctuations in the treatment of phase transitions is that the expression for the free energy given in equation ( [ eq : fept ] ) is the free energy per unit cell or per spin .",
    "the observed @xmath5 is the average over all the unit cells or all the spins and , as one observes the average over a large number @xmath61 of unit cells or over @xmath61 spins , the probability of observing a given value of @xmath5 is given by @xmath62/z .",
    "\\label{eq : ptprob}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath63 it is indeed only the minima that are observed . in the solvation - induced symmetry breaking situation we observe individual molecules and the relevant probability is given by the similar equation [ eq : prob ] but with the difference that @xmath64 rather than @xmath65 .",
    "the fact that we only see significant maxima in the shannon entropy near the critical value of @xmath49 when @xmath17 is large is consistent with the fact that true critical phenomena only occur in the limit of @xmath66 and depend on the observation of an order parameter which is an average over many replicated systems .",
    "while solvent - induced symmetry breaking will never show true divergences , there will be maxima in the shannon entropy if the value of the parameter @xmath67 is large enough compared to @xmath68 . comparing the model results with those observed for the triiodide ion",
    ", we estimate that the order of magnitude of @xmath69 is about 100 . at this value",
    "the is a weak maximum in the entropy at a higher solvent strength than the critical one and the inverse susceptibility decreases smoothly through the critical point .",
    "in this paper we have examined the solvent - induced symmetry breaking induced by water and modified water .",
    "the use of scaled charges in the solvent models allows us to vary the solvent strength which induces the symmetry breaking continuously and to determine whether there are any phenomena analogous to critical phenomena . in this particular system",
    "the transition from no symmetry breaking to symmetry breaking is weak and there is only a small maximum in the shannon entropy . by comparing the results to a simple model",
    "we see that if @xmath70 the model system shows a rather similar behavior . in order to see significant critical behavior",
    "this parameter would need to be larger by a factor of 10 or more .",
    "although this example of solvent - induced symmetry breaking does not show critical effects , there may be other situations which do .",
    "a system which was less polarisable , would have a larger value of @xmath71 , but would need a strong interaction with the solvent for symmetry - breaking to occur at all .",
