    "specifically , consider the three classical random matrix ensembles goe ( @xmath7 ) , gue ( @xmath8 ) and gse ( @xmath9 ) , i.e. we choose a hermitian matrix * x * with real ( @xmath7 ) , complex ( @xmath8 ) , or real quaternion ( @xmath9 ) entries and underlying eigenvalue probability density function of the form @xmath10 with a normalization constant @xmath11 .",

    "their motivation was a fundamental question in nuclear physics : how can one recover a missing energy level ( i.e.  eigenvalue ) from an otherwise complete set of measurements ?",
    "as observed by dyson , if the energy levels are completely correlated ( such as evenly spaced levels , also referred to as picket fence statistics ) , then missing levels can be easily identified , while if there is no correlation ( poisson statistics ) , there is no possibility of finding the missing level .",
    "the scattering resonances of neutrons scattered off a heavy nucleus are known to obey random matrix eigenvalue statistics , which lie in an intermediate correlation regime .",
    "the thinning process reduces the amount of level repulsion ( a correlating effect ) , so the thinned gaussian ensembles interpolate between moderate correlations when @xmath2 ( random matrix statistics ) and no correlations when @xmath3 ( classical extreme value statistics ) .",
    "the extreme value theorem states that the limiting distribution of the maximum of a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables must be a gumbel ( type i ) , frchet ( type ii ) , or weibull ( type iii ) distribution , provided the limit exists .",
    "since goe , gue , and gse eigenvalues obey the semicircle law @xcite , i.e.  we have the following weak convergence for the empirical measure : @xmath36 it is reasonable to expect type iii behavior in the @xmath3 limit . indeed ,",
    "following the approach of bohigas , de carvalho , and pato @xcite , we first note that is equivalent to a gap probability for the rescaled eigenvalues @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 but once we thin out the soft - edge scaled eigenvalues @xmath39 the average number of eigenvalues in the interval @xmath40 is reduced , so we want to scale @xmath41 with @xmath1 accordingly in order to keep the level density of the remaining fraction @xmath1 constant . in order to find the correct scale we note that , as @xmath42 , to leading order @xmath43 so the average number of eigenvalues in @xmath40 equals @xmath44 i.e. we should replace @xmath41 in by @xmath45 in order to keep it invariant .",
