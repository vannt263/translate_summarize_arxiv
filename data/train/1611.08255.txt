    "the analysis of the data obtained from astronomical observations has shown that we live in a spatially flat universe in accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "this acceleration could be produced by an hypothetical fluid with negative pressure , called dark energy , which would approximately represent 70 percent of all energy contained in the universe , according to the standard cosmological model .",
    "the other also unobservable part of the universe is considered by many to be constituted by weakly interacting massive particles ( also considered sometimes to form a fluid ) , and is termed as dark matter .",
    "this leaves only a mere 5 percent of the total energy of the universe to ordinary matter .",
    "the scientific community has been trying to explain the cosmic expansion of the universe using different approaches but always taking into consideration the above percentage distribution into dark matter and energy , and ordinary matter @xcite .",
    "different models have been considered , as modified gravity @xcite where the cosmic acceleration is provided without introducing exotic fluids . if one adopts a most natural and minimal view , that fully keeps without modification the einstein theory of gravity , two types of models have been proposed : use of scalar fields and unified dark energy ( ude hereafter ) .",
    "scalar field models are thus called because they introduce a field , commonly called quintessence , which is minimally couple with gravity and is self - interacting with the potential @xmath0 @xcite . in the case of ude models , it is assumed that dark energy and dark matter as different aspects of one and the same , single fluid . in both context ,",
    "scalar field and ude approaches , two types of fluids have lately received attention , namely the chaplygin gas @xcite and a viscous fluid @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the method recently proposed by @xcite to get a fluid representation of the two main observables corresponding to inflationary models , namely the spectral index @xmath1 of curvature fluctuations , and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 of density fluctuations .",
    "we propose a model containing a generalized viscous fluid with a chaplygin gas term , and obtain the allowed range of values of the model parameters in order to reproduce the most recent planck results @xcite .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that this type of fluid , with some prearranged parameters , is a good model in order to reproduce the cosmological expansion .",
    "we go on to analyze here the most general case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s : description ] the reconstruction program in scalar field theory is briefly reviewed , and also the fluid description for the universe in accelerated expansion , in a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker background . following that",
    ", we recover the expressions for the slow - roll parameters and for the observables of the inflationary model in the representation of fluid models . in sec .",
    "[ s : fluid_model ] we discuss our original model for a generalized viscous fluid with a chaplygin gas term .",
    "we explicitly show how the parameters corresponding to our model can be quite naturally adjusted so as to reproduce the most recent and precise observational data . in sec .",
    "[ s : exit ] we check the exit from inflation and the last section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in this section we summarize the procedure described by @xcite , which we will use in what follows .",
    "the method simply consists in rewriting first the slow - roll parameters as a function of the hubble parameter and its derivatives with respect to the number of e - folds",
    ". then the description of a perfect fluid model is adopted in order to rewrite the hubble parameter , so that the observables of the corresponding inflationary model can be finally written in the representation of the fluid model .",
    "consider the action corresponding to the scalar field @xmath3 with the einstein - hilbert term @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the determinant of the metric @xmath6 and @xmath7 the scalar curvature . from action ( [ eqn : action ] ) one gets the spectral index @xmath1 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 , which in the slow - roll regime are given by @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath2 being the slow - roll parameters , defined as @xmath10 here and in what follows we will use the notation where the prime indicate derivative with respect to the argument , for instance , @xmath11 .    as we are considering the flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe , the metric is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the scale factor , which defines the hubble parameter @xmath14 , the dot denoting time derivative . in this background , the gravitational field equations obtained from the action ( [ eqn : action ] ) are    [ eqn : grav_f_eq ] @xmath15    use of the already mentioned formulation by @xcite , yields    [ eqn : nfeqs ] @xmath16    these equations follow from the solution of the gravitational field equations ( [ eqn : grav_f_eq ] ) , where the scalar field @xmath3 is replaced by a new scalar field @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the positive quantity @xmath19 is introduced .",
    "moreover @xmath17 is identify with the number of e - folds @xmath20 , as a solution of the equation of motion for @xmath3 or @xmath17 . with the quantities in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nfeqs ] ) , we are now able to express the slow - roll parameters in terms of @xmath21 and its derivatives ( see * ? ? ?",
    "continuing the procedure , we use the equation of state ( eos ) of a fluid , as commonly used in fluid models @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an arbitrary function of the energy density @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the pressure of the fluid .",
    "the energy density and the pressure are given by @xcite @xmath26 in the flrw background .",
    "taking advantage of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : eos ] ) , the conservation law can be rewritten as @xmath27 , and combining it with eq .",

    "\\label{eqn : r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] concerning to this work , the advantage to use the approach described above is that we do not need integrate the function @xmath23 , or terms like @xmath31 , which in our case can not be integrate maintaining the generality of the parameters .",
    "we here introduce our fluid model , with a generalized eos with viscosity and a chaplygin gas term , namely @xmath32 the positive constants @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are here the inflationary model parameters that we need to adjust in order to reproduce planck s observational data @xcite . by comparing with eq .",

    "( [ eqn : grav_eq2 ] ) , we have @xmath39 the signs in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : f_r ] ) were set so that the energy density exponentially grows at early times and becomes constant as time increases . in the configuration",
    "@xmath40 we can find the same kind of behavior , but here the corresponding energy density there diverges faster , for most possible values of the parameters . note that , if we set @xmath41 and @xmath42 the model analyzed by @xcite is reproduced .",
    "further , the chaplygin gas is dominant when @xmath43 is small , namely @xmath44 in the regime where @xmath43 is large we also obtain the same kind of eos , assuming @xcite @xmath45 . in this regime ,",
    "different terms become dominant depending on whether @xmath36 is larger or smaller than @xmath46 , respectively ; in fact @xmath47 since we are assuming that @xmath33 and @xmath48 are of the same order of magnitude . the equations above ( eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : cg ] ) to ( [ eqn : viscosity ] ) ) tell us about the phantom barrier @xcite , where the sum of the pressure and the energy density ( eq .",
    "( [ eqn : eos ] ) ) is no more negative and starts to be positive ( that is @xmath49 ) .",
    "this barrier will be crossed if @xmath50 , or for @xmath51 with the condition that @xmath33 is sufficiently larger than @xmath48 .",
    "because of the number of parameters that we have in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : f_r ] ) , it is quite difficult to constraint them properly by the observational data .",
    "what we will do in the next section is to admit a minimum preset and analyze how the slow - roll parameters and the observables behave when the rest of the parameters are less than , larger or equal to the parameters set out initially .",
    "it is well know that , in order for inflation to occur the slow - roll parameters ( eq .  ( [ eqn : slow - roll ] ) ) must satisfy the following constraints : @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "if we want to keep the arbitrariness of the inflationary parameters of our model , we are not able to solve the friedmann equations analytically .",
    "thus we adopt the alternative procedure to apply the eos ( eq .  ( [ eqn : f_r ] ) ) on eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : epsilon ] ) and ( [ eqn : eta ] ) and then check numerically which is the allowed range of the parameters in order to obey such constraints ( figs .",
    "( [ fig : e_rxa1 ] ) to ( [ fig : n_rxg ] ) ) .    since the second and the third term of eq .",

    "then , we have only to worry about the first term . in figs .",
    "( [ fig : e_rxa1 ] ) to ( [ fig : e_rxa3 ] ) we see that the contribution of the chaplygin gas term allows the range in @xmath36 to increase for small energy density , whereas @xmath54 . for large @xmath43 , the @xmath36 values begin to get more limited , especially if the coefficient @xmath33 is big , as compared with the other coefficients .",
