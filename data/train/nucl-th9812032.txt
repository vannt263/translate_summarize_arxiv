    "may then produce _ disoriented chiral condensates _",
    "( dcc ) , a coherent oscillation of the pion field that is manifested through anomalous pion multiplicity distributions @xcite and associated enhancements of electromagnetic processes @xcite ( for reviews of the topic , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to assess the prospects for such dcc phenomena to actually occur and be detectable above the background , it is necessary to perform extensive dynamical calculations .",
    "most dynamical studies have been carried out within the framework of the su(2 ) linear @xmath0 model which incorporates the @xmath0 and @xmath1 degrees of freedom by means of an o(4 ) field @xcite .",
    "while the omission of the strangeness degree of freedom is justified in many nuclear studies , since the mass of the strange quark is large compared with the temperatures typically encountered , it may not be appropriate in the dcc context because of the high temperature required for the approximate restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "we therefore find it of interest to extend the treatment to the strange sector and assess the effect of the dcc physics .",
    "the resulting extended theory has a richer structure , as two order parameters are now involved , the light quark condensate _ and _ the strange quark condensate , and the group of mesonic excitations has expanded from su(2 ) to su(3 ) .",
    "moreover , whereas the usual su(2 ) treatment considers only the four fields representing @xmath0 and @xmath1 excitations , the su(3 ) model includes the eighteen meson fields of the scalar and pseudoscalar nonets .",
    "the incorporation of strangeness causes significant changes , as will be discussed for thermal equilibrium as well as the coupled dynamics of the two order parameters .",
    "moreover , we explore the possibility that any of the mesonic quasi - particle modes become unstable during the evolution . the study is carried out within the framework of the linear @xmath0 model .",
    "although its su(3 ) version has been known for a long time , to our knowledge it has not yet been utilized in connection with disoriented chiral condensates .    the presentation is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : su3 ] we introduce the su(3 ) linear @xmath0 model and fix the parameters to the meson masses in the mean - field approximation . the regions of instability of the various meson species are then delineated in the plane of the two order parameters and at zero temperature ( sect .",
    "[ sec : regions ] ) .",
    "subsequently , in sect .",
    "[ sec : temperature ] , we study how the properties develop with temperature . after having elucidated the equilibrium features , we then , in section [ sec : dynamics ] , consider various idealized dynamical scenarios that emulate what may be experienced in the rapidly expanding collision zone following a high - energy nuclear collision .",
    "finally , we briefly summarize our results .",
    "the linear @xmath0 model was first introduced by gell - mann and levy @xcite . in a subsequent work",
    ", levy extended this model from su(2 ) to su(3 ) @xcite based on the success of the eightfold way @xcite ( for a review of the early work done in su(3 ) chiral models , see ref .",
    "it turns out that the model successfully accounts for the masses of the pseudoscalar and scalar nonet , especially for the @xmath2 splitting by including a term that breaks u(3)@xmath3u(3 ) symmetry but conserves the su(3)@xmath3su(3 ) symmetry ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the data for pion - pion and pion - kaon scattering can also be described @xcite and the tree - level predictions are in agreement with weinberg s predictions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the nonlinear realization was preferred over the linear one during the subsequent decades .",
    "the linear description of chiral symmetry by means of the scalar mesons as explicit degrees of freedom is supported by the recent confirmation of the @xmath0 meson @xcite , which has led to the reappearance of the @xmath0 meson in the compilation by the particle data group @xcite , albeit with a very uncertain mass in the range of @xmath4 mev .",
    "interestingly , the recent fit to the scalar mesons by trnqvist @xcite can in fact be interpreted as a model unitarization based upon u(3)@xmath3u(3 ) chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the su(3 ) linear @xmath0 model was formulated in the original paper by levy with the baryon octet @xcite .",
    "vector mesons can be included also as massive yang - mills fields @xcite .",
    "the trace anomaly can be effectively accounted for by a glueball field @xcite .",
    "the glueball field might be relevant for the chiral dynamics as pointed out most recently for the su(2 ) linear @xmath0 model with quarks @xcite .",
    "we leave the study of the effects of the glueball field on the dcc formation in su(3 ) for future study .",
    "this model , including baryons , vector mesons , and a dilaton field , has recently been applied to describe baryon masses as well as nuclear matter and hypernuclei @xcite .    in the following",
    "we discuss the model for pseudoscalar and scalar mesons only , as we are interested in meson - dominated environments , such as those expected to be produced in the central rapidity region by relativistic nuclear collisions at rhic . due to their higher masses",
    ", vector mesons will become important only at higher temperatures and will therefore not be considered here .",
    "the model used has a strong connection to qcd .",
    "the order of the chiral phase transition of qcd was discussed using an effective lagrangian for arbitrary number of flavors by pisarski and wilczek @xcite using the linear su(n ) @xmath0 model which is the most general renormalizable lagrangian consistent with the symmetries of qcd .",
    "the chiral critical point was examined in @xcite using the same effective chiral lagrangian for 2 + 1 flavors .",
    "we will employ the same effective lagrangian in the present study .      for the su(2 ) version of the model",
    ", there are only four mesonic modes , the @xmath0 isosinglet and the @xmath5 isotriplet , whereas the expanded su(3 ) chiral model contains 18 different mesons , the nine pseudoscalar and the nine scalar mesons of the respective nonets .",
    "the building block of the chiral su(3 ) symmetric lagrangian is then the corresponding matrix m , @xmath6 here @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the u(3 ) components of the scalar and pseudoscalar nonets , respectively , and @xmath9 denotes the standard gell - mann matrices ( including @xmath10 ) .",
    "the explicit representation in terms of the physical states is @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are mixed states of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons and we note in particular the expressions for the pions and kaons in terms of the gell - mann matrices , @xmath16 for the scalar nonet we have @xmath17 where we have introduced the two order parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath18 , corresponding to the light quark and the strange quark condensate , respectively .",
    "the @xmath18 is in this notation a pure @xmath19 state , _",
    "i.e. _  ideal mixing is assumed . nevertheless , as we will see , the @xmath0 and @xmath18 can still mix .",
    "we start from the u(3)@xmath3u(3 ) chirally symmetric renormalizable lagrangian for scalar and pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath20   + \\frac{1}{2 } \\mu^2 { \\rm tr } \\left[{\\rm m } { \\rm m}^\\dagger \\right ] - \\lambda { \\rm tr } \\left[{\\rm m } { \\rm m}^\\dagger{\\rm m } { \\rm m}^\\dagger \\right ] - \\lambda ' \\left({\\rm tr } \\left[{\\rm m } { \\rm m}^\\dagger\\right]\\right)^2 \\quad . \\label{lag}\\ ] ] contrary to the su(2 ) case , there are now two coupling terms of fourth order in the fields , with the strength parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    in order to obtain a correct description of the meson masses , it is necessary to include a term that breaks the u(3)@xmath3u(3 ) symmetry while still maintaining su(3)@xmath3su(3 ) symmetry , @xmath23   \\quad .",
    "\\label{lagsu3}\\ ] ] this term splits @xmath1 and @xmath15 which are degenerate in u(3)@xmath3u(3 ) , even in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "it is related to the u@xmath24(1 ) anomaly of qcd and instanton - induced interactions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are no additional independent terms that are invariant under chiral su(3)@xmath3su(3 ) transformations , so any higher - order forms can be reexpressed as functions of the three interaction terms already introduced .    the symmetry is explicitly broken by an additional linear term in the lagrangian , @xmath25 which makes the pseudoscalar mesons massive .",
    "the second relation follows from the pcac relations for pions and kaons @xcite .",
    "the vacuum expectation values for the @xmath0 and @xmath18 fields are then fixed by the pion and kaon decay constants , @xmath26 using the experimental values for the charged meson decay amplitudes , @xmath27 mev and @xmath28 mev .",
    "we note that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are remarkably similar .      in the limit of pure su(2 ) , we consider only the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fields in the above expressions for the meson matrices ( [ eq : pmatrix]-[eq : smatrix ] ) . as the @xmath18 field",
    "is assumed to be zero , the su(3 ) term ( [ su3 ] ) vanishes .",
    "moreover , the interaction terms proportional to @xmath21 and @xmath22 are identical because the relation @xmath31",
    "= { \\mbox{${1\\over2}$}}\\left({\\rm tr } \\left[{\\rm m } { \\rm m}^\\dagger\\right]\\right)^2\\ ] ] holds for traceless matrices due to the burgoyne s identity @xcite .",
    "the matrices are not traceless in the general u(3)@xmath3u(3 ) case due to the presence of the singlet states . in su(2 )",
    "the lagrangian then reduces to @xmath32 which is recognized as the su(2 ) linear @xmath0 model , @xmath33 if one assigns @xmath34 and @xmath35 and ignores the constant term @xmath36 .",
    "however , since the su(3 ) case has additional contributions from the strange quark condensate , the effective parameter values are shifted and hence the values employed in the su(2 ) linear @xmath0 model can not be used as a guideline for su(3 ) .",
    "consequently , the parameters of the su(3 ) model will be fixed to the meson masses of the nonets .",
    "the remaining four parameters of the model , @xmath37 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath38 , are fixed by the meson masses in vacuum which are given by the eigenvalues of the curvature tensor , @xmath39 evaluated at the equilibrium point . in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the only mixings are between @xmath0 and @xmath18 and between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the values of the model parameters are constrained by the fact that the existence of a stable equilibrium requires @xmath40 to be positive definite , _",
    "i.e. _  the eigenvalues ( the physical unmixed masses squared ) must be positive .",
    "the expressions for the masses and the mixing angles are listed in the appendix .",
    "the easiest way is to fix the coupling constants to the pion and kaon masses and the mass average @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14-@xmath15 mass splitting is then predicted .",
    "then @xmath37 and @xmath22 are related but can only be fixed by a choice for the scalar meson mass , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 must be larger than @xmath42 to ensure a positive value of @xmath43 .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath37 is only positive for @xmath44 mev .",
    "as already noted , @xmath45 is not well known , with current estimates ranging between 400 and 1200 mev @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider several cases within this range , @xmath46 and 1000 mev .",
    "the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath38 , and @xmath47 are analytically related to the pseudoscalar masses , @xmath48 and @xmath22 is then determined by @xmath45 . the ( unphysical ) case @xmath49 yields degenerate masses for strange and non - strange mesons .",
    "these parameters are listed in table [ tab : par ] together with the masses of the pseudoscalar and scalar meson nonets .",
    "the pseudoscalar mixing angle turns out to be @xmath50 .",
    "for comparison , the gell - mann  okubo mass formula gives @xmath51 while experiment seems to favor @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the masses of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are reproduced at the level of @xmath53@xmath54 .",
    "the parameters can be changed to get a pseudoscalar mixing angle of @xmath55 for a higher kaon mass and a lower kaon decay constant @xcite . a more interesting approach to get a correct mixing angle",
    "has been recently pointed out in @xcite where the mass relations were modified by the inclusion of the pseudoscalar decay constants .",
    "the anomaly term ( eq .  ( [ lagsu3 ] ) ) is important for obtaining the correct meson mass spectra , especially for giving the @xmath15 its large mass and splitting the @xmath1 and @xmath14 masses .",
    "in addition , the term mixes the @xmath14 and @xmath15 meson states away from the ideal mixing states @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the former being a pure light - quark system and the latter a pure @xmath58 state .",
    "there are arguments that the @xmath59 chiral phase transition and the restoration of the @xmath60 chiral symmetry does not necessarily coincide ( scenario 1 considered by shuryak @xcite ) .",
    "then , a nonvanishing anomaly term would be responsible for giving the ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) and ( @xmath56 , @xmath61 ) meson pairs different masses , even in the @xmath59 chiral symmetric phase .",
    "their mass splitting is proportional to the @xmath18 field , hence is related to the finite strange quark mass .",
    "also the @xmath56 gets a contribution from the anomaly term due to the finite strange quark mass , even in the @xmath59 chiral limit , but the @xmath57 does not .",
    "this could make the @xmath57 lighter than the @xmath56 , as pointed out by schfer @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath63 mesons are degenerate for a vanishing @xmath0 field , so their mass splitting from the anomaly term is related only to the light quark masses .",
    "we recall that the situation for the scalar nonet is still somewhat controversial ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of scalar mesons and their assignment to the scalar nonet ) .",
    "weinstein and isgur suggested , that the @xmath64 as well as the @xmath65 are bound @xmath66 molecules @xcite .",
    "the corresponding meson states for the scalar nonet are higher in mass and are identified with @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in this picture , the mass of the @xmath18 can be chosen to be close to @xmath67 but then the @xmath61 is too light ( see table [ tab : par ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , trnqvist argues that all the lowest - lying scalar mesons are describable in a quark model and can be assigned to the scalar nonet ; the more massive scalar states are then excited states . in table [",
    "tab : par ] we choose the latter picture for comparison .",
    "the mass of @xmath65 is close to its experimental value .",
    "the @xmath18 is much heavier than the @xmath64 , especially for the case @xmath69 gev .",
    "the mass of the @xmath63 seems to be far off compared to the @xmath70 .",
    "nevertheless , it was recently argued that there is evidence for a light scalar @xmath71 @xcite .      in the su(2 )",
    "case , isospin invariance implies that the pion field vector @xmath72 is equally likely to point in any particular direction , @xmath73 .",
    "if the iso - orientation of the pion field is the same throughout the entire source , then all the radiated pions emerge with the same isospin alignment in each separate event .",
    "it then follows that the resulting _ neutral pion fraction _",
    "@xmath74 has the distribution @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "this distribution differs significantly from the narrow peak around one third that would be expected if each individual pion had a random isospin orientation and it has therefore been proposed as a suitable dcc signal .",
    "this situation remains the same in the su(3 ) case with regard to the three - dimensional pion subspace .",
    "but , in addition , there is also invariance in the four - dimensional subspace of the kaon field ( @xmath76 ) , _ i.e. _  the direction of the kaon field vector @xmath77 , @xmath78 is equally likely to point in any direction .",
    "thus , by analogy with the pions , it is natural to consider the _",
    "neutral kaon fraction _",
    ", @xmath79 under the similar assumption of full alignment of the kaon field in each distinct event , it is elementary to calculate the corresponding distribution , @xmath80^{-{1\\over2}}\\\\ & = & { 2\\over\\pi } \\int_0^{\\sqrt{r_k } } d\\cos\\psi_k\\ [ r_k-\\cos^2\\psi_k]^{-{1\\over2}}\\ = \\ 1\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , all values of the neutral kaon fraction @xmath81 are equally likely , whereas a statistical emission would yield a narrow distribution peaked at one half . as was",
    "the case for @xmath82 , the result for @xmath83 is independent of any explicit chiral symmetry breaking , as it relies only on the invariance with regard to transformations among the four kaon states .",
    "contrary to the neutral pions , neutral kaons may decay by weak interactions into hadrons , @xmath84 , which can be detected in heavy - ion experiments by standard techniques .",
    "although event - by - event reconstruction is impractical , fluctuation analysis of the abundance of neutral and charged kaons has been proven feasible with the present heavy - ion experiments at the sps .",
    "an enhancement of the ratio near zero or one , or at least a broadening of @xmath83 , might be visible and would suggest the occurrence of non - equilibrium effects of the dcc type .",
    "in this section we examine the regions of instability for the pseudoscalar mesons in the plane of the two order parameters @xmath0 and @xmath18 , at zero temperature .",
    "this information is particularly relevant in the idealized quench scenario , in which the initially hot system , in which chiral symmetry is at least partially restored , is suddenly cooled down . generally , the effective meson masses depend on both condensates and it is thus more complicated to map out the occurrence of instabilities .",
    "lattice gauge calculations indicate that although the light - quark condensate does not entirely vanish in the chirally restored phase it is considerably reduced .",
    "the strange - quark condensate follows this trend but its reduction is less pronounced due to the higher mass of the strange quark @xcite .",
    "the different behavior of the strange - quark condensate is ensured in the linear su(3 ) @xmath0 model with the inclusion of the @xmath18 field .",
    "the mean - field expressions for the effective meson masses as functions of the order parameters and the thermal field fluctuations are given in the appendix . in the following ,",
    "we study only the pseudoscalar mesons as they are directly measurable in heavy - ion experiments .    in the mean - field approximation @xcite ,",
    "the quasi - particles satisfy the klein - gordon dispersion relation , @xmath85 .",
    "thus , whenever a negative value of @xmath86 occurs , the frequency @xmath87 is imaginary for sufficiently small values of the wave number @xmath88 , leading to an exponential growth of the corresponding field component .",
    "this phenomenon is familiar from the discussion of supercritical fields and it manifests itself as an enhancement of the number of soft mesons of the affected kind .",
    "therefore it is of interest to delineate the regions of stability for the various meson species .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the critical boundaries for the pseudoscalar mesons for the four selected values of @xmath45 .",
    "we see that @xmath89 is negative in the upper - left part while @xmath90 is negative in the lower - right part . for the relatively small mass of 400  mev",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath14 are the only mesons exhibiting instabilities and the corresponding supercritical regions are fairly small .",
    "in particular , there is no combination of the two order parameters @xmath0 and @xmath18 that would cause the kaons to become unstable .",
    "these general features remain true also at @xmath91 , although the regions of @xmath1 and @xmath14 instability have expanded considerably .",
    "this expansion continues steadily as @xmath45 is increased further and by 800  mev the situation has changed dramatically , as the model parameter @xmath37 has turned positive .",
    "instabilities are now possible for all four pseudoscalar mesons and occur simultaneously in a small region near the origin where full chiral symmetry is approximately restored .",
    "however , it should be noted that the instabilities of @xmath62 , @xmath14 , or @xmath15 occur only for considerably reduced values of the strange order parameter @xmath18 .",
    "thus , a reduction of only the light - quark condensate @xmath0 could produce only the standard pionic instability .",
    "moreover , the critical boundaries for the @xmath14 and @xmath62 mesons are quite close to one another .    finally , for @xmath69 gev , an imaginary pion mass is reached already after only a slight reduction of either @xmath0 or @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , the kaon is now unstable over a wide order - parameter region and the critical boundary for @xmath14 is again close to the kaon boundary .",
    "we also note that the critical boundary for @xmath15 has expanded considerably so that this meson may exhibit instability as well even if chiral symmetry has been only partly restored .",
    "we now study how the properties of the system develops as the temperature is raised",
    ". statistical equilibrium of the su(3 ) linear @xmath0 model can be treated in the mean - field approximation along the lines developed for the su(2 ) case @xcite .",
    "the local field strength is then decomposed into the ( smooth ) order parameter and the residual fluctuations , @xmath92 the insertion of this decomposition into the general equation of motion then leads to separate equations of motion for the order parameters and the individual quasi - particle fields .",
    "the trilinear fluctuation terms are included by the hartree factorization technique , @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the thermal average , @xmath95 in the diagonal representation .",
    "the sum is over all finite wave numbers @xmath96 and the associated energy is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the appropriate temperature - dependent effective mass for the meson species @xmath99 , as obtained by solving the coupled equations selfconsistently .",
    "we need to take into account only the thermal fluctuations of @xmath1 , @xmath62 , @xmath0 , and @xmath14 mesons , as they are the lightest and thus have the largest field fluctuations .",
    "the other mesons ( @xmath15 , @xmath61 , @xmath63 , @xmath18 ) have masses near or above one gev and the next level of refinement would then rather involve the fluctuations of the vector meson fields .",
    "the thermal equilibrium values of the two order parameters are then determined by the resulting equations of motion for @xmath100 and @xmath101 , @xmath102 where the effective masses for the order parameters are given by @xmath103 the mixing of the field fluctuations @xmath104 and @xmath105 can be treated to a sufficient degree of approximation by the replacements @xmath106 where we have neglected fluctuations of the heavier @xmath18 meson . mixing between @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "is ignored for the thermal fluctuations as the mixing angle turns out to be near zero even at high temperatures .",
    "the final expressions for the meson masses can be found in the appendix .    in order to simplify the notation",
    ", we omit the brackets @xmath94 in the following so that the order parameters will be denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath18 and the thermal field fluctuations by @xmath107 and so on .",
    "the coupled equations for the order parameter ( [ eq : eomsigma],[eq : eomzeta ] ) , the meson masses ( see appendix ) , and the fluctuations ( [ eq : fluct],[eq : fluctmix ] ) are solved iteratively with an overdamped newton method .    we note in passing , that we assume that the coupling constants of the effective interaction is temperature independent .",
    "this is a strong assumption , especially for the anomaly term where one knows that the corresponding coupling constant should be much smaller at the chiral phase transition @xcite .",
    "effects should be especially seen for the @xmath108 mesons @xcite and could even lead to parity - violating effects as pointed out recently @xcite .",
    "how the coupling constants scale with temperature is not precisely known .",
    "there exists estimates but they can be applied in principle only for a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "therefore , we leave this interesting question for future investigations .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the temperature dependence of the total fluctuations of the @xmath1 , @xmath62 , @xmath0 , and @xmath14 quasi - particle fields for the various values of @xmath45 ( _ i.e. _  @xmath109 , _ etc .",
    "_ ) . as expected , the pion fluctuations are dominant at low temperatures due to their small mass , and the other contributions can be safely neglected for @xmath110 mev .",
    "the situation changes drastically at higher temperatures as the strange degrees of freedom are activated .",
    "the kaon fluctuations constitute a 20% correction at @xmath111 mev and are already half the pion contribution at @xmath112 mev and can thus no longer be neglected .",
    "the kaon fluctuations become remarkably similar to the ones of the pions at higher temperatures and contribute equally at @xmath113 mev .",
    "note that the degeneracy factor for the kaon is four thirds times that of the pion so that the kaon contribution would dominate if the masses of the pion and the kaon were equal .",
    "the thermal fluctuations do not change significantly with @xmath45 , except of course for those of the @xmath0 field itself which for large @xmath45 grow rapidly in the @xmath0 crossover region as the effective @xmath0 mass experiences a pronounced minimum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : masses ] ) .",
    "the figure also displays the thermal evolution of the two order parameters .",
    "they exhibit a smooth crossover from their large ( and nearly equal ) vacuum values towards ever smaller values at high temperatures .",
    "the fastest change for @xmath0 occurs around @xmath114 .",
    "the decrease of the strange order parameter @xmath18 is much less pronounced , as a consequence of the larger kaon mass , and the corresponding crossover does not occur until above 400 mev .",
    "it is evident that the degree of chiral symmetry restoration achieved depends sensitively on the adopted value of @xmath45 .",
    "for the smaller values the order parameters decrease only moderately .",
    "for example , at @xmath115 @xmath0 is still above 50  mev , for the commonly employed value of @xmath91 whereas it has dropped below 30  mev for @xmath116 .",
    "the more complete symmetry restoration at higher @xmath45 values is due to the fact that the parameter @xmath37 has now become positive and the coupling constant @xmath22 has increased .",
    "the former feature affects the spontaneous symmetry breaking at zero temperature , while the latter enhances the temperature dependence of the meson masses .",
    "on the basis of these observations , we expect that the most dramatic effects of the extension to su(3 ) will occur for large values of @xmath45 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the two order parameters is well illustrated by the thermal path of the equilibrium point in the @xmath117 plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orderpar ] for @xmath118 .",
    "the solid circles mark the progression of the path in temperature intervals of 100 mev . in addition",
    ", we also show the result of omitting the kaon fluctuations as well as the result for the pure su(2 ) case . in the latter case",
    ", there is obviously no change in the strange order parameter and we note that @xmath0 reaches very small values for temperatures above @xmath119 ( the last two dots are for temperatures of 400 and 500 mev ) .",
    "the su(3 ) case without kaon fluctuations is close to the pure su(2 ) case but differs from the full su(3 ) calculation .",
    "in particular , @xmath18 hardly changes in the absence of kaon fluctuations .",
    "the paths for the full su(3 ) calculation develop very slowly at low temperatures ( note that the points for @xmath111 mev are quite close to the vacuum point ) , which reflects the above finding that the order parameters change little over that temperature interval . in the intermediate temperature range of @xmath120 mev both order parameters decrease approximately linearly and",
    "the path follows a nearly straight line . at higher temperatures",
    ", @xmath0 quickly saturates while @xmath18 is only now beginning to drop faster . at these high temperatures ,",
    "the kaon fluctuations now provide the dominant contribution to the meson masses .",
    "we see that the inclusion of kaon fluctuations ( _ i.e. _  going from su(2 ) to su(3 ) ) has a dramatic effect on the thermal evolution of the order parameters .",
    "it is interesting to compare our findings for the full su(3 ) case with related previous work .",
    "the linear su(3 ) @xmath0 model was solved in the @xmath121 expansion by means of the saddle - point approximation for finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "it was found that the light - quark condensate drops sharply at 180 - 190 mev , while the strange - quark condensate has changed by only 20% at @xmath119 mev as compared to its vacuum value . on the other hand , we find that the changes of the order parameters depend sensitively on the chosen parameter values , especially the value for @xmath45 .",

    "our calculations yield a less dramatic behavior , especially for a low @xmath0 vacuum mass , which thus seems to favor a high vacuum value for @xmath45 . for the case",

    "still , the @xmath0 condensate changes less than indicated by lattice data , while the strange condensate follows the trend seen on the lattice but shifted towards higher temperatures .",
    "however , this comparison should be taken only as suggestive , as we are using an effective model .",
    "the effective meson masses will exhibit a temperature dependence due to the thermal decrease of the order parameters and the associated growth of the field fluctuations ( the explicit expressions for the meson masses , including the contributions from thermal fluctuations , are given in the appendix ) .",

    "the minimum of the @xmath63 mass is located at a slightly higher temperature , @xmath134 , due to its strong coupling to the strange order parameter @xmath18 which starts decreasing at a higher temperature than @xmath0 .",

    "are closely clustered around 1  gev .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath123 masses appear to converge at higher temperatures , signaling the onset of full chiral symmetry restoration .    comparing the results obtained with the different @xmath0 masses",
    ", we observe some general trends .",
    "first , the pions , as well as the other pseudoscalar mesons , grow more massive at high temperatures ; there are thus fewer medium - modified pions in a thermalized system at high temperatures as compared to a free gas at the same @xmath137 .",
    "second , the effective @xmath62 and @xmath14 mesons become approximately degenerate with the effective @xmath1 meson .",
    "this will enhance the yield ratios to @xmath138 and @xmath139 as compared with the free - gas estimate of @xmath140 and @xmath141 for @xmath113 mev .    at high temperature ,",
    "the thermal fluctuations of the vector mesons can no longer be neglected . of course , their impact on the results presented depend on the change of their masses with temperature .",
    "if the vector meson masses stay near their vacuum values up to @xmath136 , or perhaps drop with temperature , the corresponding thermal fluctuations will grow important already in the transition region for the order parameter @xmath0 . on the other hand , if the vector meson masses increase with temperature , as does the @xmath15 , then their contributions can possibly be neglected over the temperature range shown , as they are too heavy to become significantly agitated .",
    "the thermal @xmath61 and @xmath63 fluctuations become important at high temperatures , say @xmath142 mev , as their masses are then close to those of @xmath14 and @xmath62 , respectively . as",
    "the thermal masses are in the range of 1  gev , vector mesons should be also included and might constitute a bigger correction term at very high temperatures .",
    "therefore , we omitted the @xmath61 and @xmath63 fluctuations",
    ". it might be interesting to study vector mesons within the linear @xmath0 model and they should clearly be included in studies of the high - temperature behavior of pseudoscalar and scalar mesons above the chiral transition .    a more important effect is associated with the temperature dependence of the anomaly term ( [ lagsu3 ] ) .",
    "if the anomaly term becomes considerably weaker as the temperature is increased , it will reduce the thermal masses of the @xmath15 rather than increase them .",
    "the thermal mass of the @xmath61 mesons will also be reduced by this effect .",
    "first estimates indeed show that this is the case , so that these thermal fluctuations then ought to be included . whether the presence of these additional low - lying mass states will change",
    "the order of the phase transition is beyond the scope of the present investigation but will be addressed in a forthcoming work .",
    "in this section , we consider a simplified dynamical scenario that approximates the conditions occurring in the central region of a relativistic heavy - ion collision . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt the approach given in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a scaling expansion is emulated by means of a rayleigh cooling , and extend it to su(3 ) .",

    ", we consider thermalized matter at a specified temperature , with only the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons included .",
    "the matter is then assumed to experience a uniform scaling expansion which causes the field fluctuations to decrease according to the dimensionality @xmath143 of the expansion .",
    "this brings the system out of equilibrium , as the effective potential governing the order parameter reverts to its vacuum form faster than the order parameter can follow . for the standard su(2 )",
    "case , a boost invariant expansion , corresponding to @xmath144 , was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the three - dimensional scenario was explored in refs .  @xcite .",
    "if the expanding system is strictly uniform , its properties depend only on the elapsed proper time @xmath145 , _ i.e. _  the time experienced in a local comoving frame , and the dalembert operator is then given by @xmath146 the equations of motion of the two order parameters are therefore readily obtained , @xmath147 where the effective masses @xmath148 and @xmath149 are given in eqs .",

    "we employ a relatively high initial temperature , @xmath152 , in order to achieve a high degree of chiral symmetry restoration in the initial state . moreover , the initial time is chosen as @xmath153 , as is most commonly done , and @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "figure [ fig : dyn1000_order ] shows the trajectories of the two order parameters for @xmath116 and in two different expansion scenarios , a longitudinal ( @xmath144 ) and isotropic ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "the former represents a lower bound on the degree of expansion , as it assumes that no transverse expansion occurs at all , whereas the latter probably overestimates the expansion , so the actual physical scenarios is expected to be intermediate between these two extremes .    for the three - dimensional expansion",
    ", the strange order parameter is changing first and overshooting its vacuum value .",
    "the @xmath0 order parameter remains quite unchanged during that time and starts growing towards its vacuum value only at later times .",
    "the long - dashed curve traces the movement of the equilibrium point as the temperature is reduced ; this thermal path would be followed if the expansion were adiabatic so the system had time to equilibrate throughout the expansion process . however , because the expansion is fast , the dynamical trajectory oscillates around the thermal path .",
    "for the fastest expansion , only one oscillation occurs before the effective potential has reestablished its vacuum form and the remaining oscillations are then around the vacuum point .",
    "it is interesting that the early oscillations of @xmath18 are much stronger than those of @xmath0 , whereas the situation is reversed for the late oscillations around the vacuum point .",
    "the one - dimensional expansion shows a distinctly different behavior . as above",
    ", the initial evolution is primarily in the direction of the strange order parameter , but there are now several oscillations around the adiabatic path before the vacuum point is reached .",
    "this is because the order parameter trajectory oscillates around the instantaneous minimum in the effective potential which now develops relatively slowly from its initial value near the origin towards the vacuum point .",
    "thus there is more opportunity for the order parameter to overshoot the vacuum point and rebound towards smaller values .",
    "the pattern in the evolution of the order parameters will be reflected in the behavior of the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons masses .",
    "figure [ fig : dyn_mass1d ] ( left ) shows the time dependence of the pseudoscalar meson masses for the one - dimensional expansion .",
    "the masses are scaled to their respective vacuum values so that they will tend to unity at large times .",
    "the pseudoscalar meson masses remain well above zero during the evolution .",
    "the initial value of the pion mass is much larger than its vacuum value and it exhibits a slowly decreasing average behavior , overlayed with large oscillations containing several different frequencies .",
    "this rather complicated pattern is a result of the coupled evolution of the two order parameters during the expansion .",
    "the oscillations are nearly undamped over the entire time interval shown , _",
    "i.e. _  up to @xmath157 .",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath14 masses also show oscillations but they appear to have only one main frequency and the amplitudes are much smaller than for the @xmath1 mass .",
    "the @xmath15 mass does not change very much and has only small fluctuations around its vacuum value .",
    "the scalar masses experience a different time evolution , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_mass1d ] ( right ) .",
    "all scalar masses start below their vacuum value and approach their free value from below , contrary to the behavior of the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the oscillations of the scalar meson masses are sometimes in and sometimes out of phase .",
    "especially the @xmath0 and the @xmath18 meson masses are quite often in opposite phases .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations are rather similar , with that of the @xmath0 meson mass being the largest , and they are not sufficiently large to overshoot the respective vacuum value .    performing a fourier transform of @xmath158 , we find that there are two main frequencies involved , one at @xmath159 and the other at @xmath160 .",
    "the oscillations of the @xmath0 order parameter is dominated by the lower frequency , with a weaker component from the higher one , whereas the strange order parameter has only the higher frequency .",
    "the pion has both frequencies with the lower one being stronger .",
    "the @xmath62 , @xmath14 , and k@xmath161 masses follow the frequency of the strange order parameter , while those of @xmath15 and @xmath61 seem to have both frequencies at about equal strength .",
    "now we turn to the three - dimensional expansion .",
    "figure [ fig : dyn_mass3d ] ( left ) shows the time dependence of the pseudoscalar masses .",
    "the oscillations of the pion mass are now much stronger than for the other pseudoscalar mesons ( and the pion curve is therefore scaled down by a factor of ten ) .",
    "the oscillations are also much smoother than in the one - dimensional case .",
    "most significantly , the oscillations brings the pion mass into the region of instability several times ( a total of six in the specific calculation ) .",
    "remarkably , the second minimum at @xmath162 is slightly deeper than the first minimum .",
    "this is a result of the dynamical interplay between the two order parameters . indeed , the order parameters are not really in phase at the time of the first minimum , as the initial change of @xmath18 is much larger than that of @xmath0 .",
    "however , at the time of the second minimum the two order parameters are already oscillating around the vacuum point and are in phase , so that the oscillations in the pion mass are enhanced . at @xmath163 the masses of all",
    "the other pseudoscalar mesons also exhibit their lowest minimum , but the mass oscillations of these mesons are weaker than in the one - dimensional expansion ( note the different mass scales in figs .",
    "[ fig : dyn_mass1d ] and [ fig : dyn_mass3d ] ) .",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath14 masses are evolving very similarly , but the @xmath15 mass shows a different behavior : it is not oscillating with one dominant frequency , as was the case for the @xmath1 , @xmath62 , and @xmath14 masses .",
    "for all pseudoscalar mesons , the damping of the oscillations is stronger than in the longitudinal expansion , as would be expected .",
    "the scalar meson masses obtained for @xmath156 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_mass3d ] ( right ) and their oscillations are seen to be stronger than for @xmath144 . again",
    ", the scalar meson masses start below their vacuum values but then overshoot them later .",
    "the @xmath0 meson mass has a deep minimum at @xmath164 which comes remarkable close to zero .",
    "also the @xmath61 has strong oscillations in phase with the pion .",
    "the frequencies of the @xmath62 and @xmath18 masses differ from those of the @xmath1 and @xmath14 masses .",
    "a fourier decomposition of @xmath158 reveals that there are again two main frequencies , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "the @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath61 have the lower frequency and the k@xmath161 and @xmath18 have the higher one , while the @xmath15 has both frequencies with equal strength .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath62 and @xmath14 masses evolve with a broad distribution of frequencies around @xmath167 .",
    "finally , we note that since the displayed masses are scaled relative to their free values , the pion will always seem to have the strongest oscillations which could be somewhat misleading .",
    "in fact the pseudoscalar mass shifts are all of the same order of magnitude , around 150400 mev for the first extremum in the evolution for @xmath156 . on an absolute scale , the fluctuations of especially the @xmath62 and",
    "@xmath14 masses are as large as those of the @xmath1 mass which my possibly lead to observable effects in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .      we finally utilize the calculated time - dependent effective @xmath1 and @xmath62 masses to illustrate the possible associated enhancements in the corresponding spectral distributions of the free mesons . towards this end , we assume that the evolution of the field amplitude for a given meson mode is governed by a klein - gordon field equation , @xmath168 here @xmath96 denotes the momentum of the mode and the time - dependent frequency is given by the indicated dispersion relation , where @xmath169 is the calculated time - dependent effective mass squared . invoking the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can then calculate the enhancement coefficient for that particular mode , @xmath170 .",
    "this quantity ( which is never less than unity ) expresses the degree to which the population of the mode has been enhanced due to the time dependence experienced by the frequency .",
    "thus , if the initial occupation number is @xmath171 , then its final value is given in terms of @xmath170 as @xmath172x_{{\\bf k}}-{\\mbox{${1\\over2}$}},\\ ] ] where the presence of the one half reflects the effect of the quantum fluctuations of the field amplitude for that mode .",
    "figure [ fig : xpi ] shows the resulting pion enhancement coefficients for the two pseudo - expansion scenarios considered .",
    "for @xmath144 there is a significant enhancement of the softest modes as well as a moderate peak near a pion momentum of 400  mev .",
    "the former feature is a direct reflection of the relatively slow overall decrease of @xmath86 in the course of time , while the peak near a momentum of @xmath173 results from the quasi - periodic oscillations of the frequency .",
    "this latter effect was discussed already in connection with the enhancement of electromagnetic processes @xcite . the results for @xmath156 exhibit a large and fairly sharp peak at a slightly higher momentum , with a more moderate and smooth enhancement of the soft modes .",
    "the latter reflects the fact that @xmath169 remains fairly constant on the average , after the initial fast drop . as a consequence of the more perfect quench achieved with @xmath156 , the oscillations of @xmath86 are more harmonic and , therefore , the parametric amplification becomes stronger .",
    "the resulting peak in the enhancement is located at a momentum of 480  mev which corresponds very closely to the expected resonance energy , @xmath174 .",
    "figure [ fig : xk ] shows the corresponding results for the kaons . since the relative modification of the effective kaon mass is smaller ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : dyn_mass1d]-[fig : dyn_mass3d ] ) , the associated enhancements are also much more modest .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to discern features similar to those of the pions . in particular , for @xmath144 there is relatively broad enhancement of the softer modes followed by a small resonance peak and for @xmath156 the most prominent feature is resonance at a slightly larger momentum but , perhaps surprisingly , it is quite small .",
    "we finally wish to stress that these illustrations are based on a fairly schematic picture and they should not be taken as quantitative predictions .",
    "nevertheless , they do suggest that significant spectral enhancements may be present in the su(3 ) description and they also give a general idea of their specific features .",
    "evidently , a quantitative prediction would require much more elaborate calculations of the complicated collision dynamics .",
    "the present investigation presents a first exploration of how the inclusion of strangeness in the effective @xmath0 model affects the features associated with disoriented chiral condensates .",
    "the resulting su(3 ) model contains both the scalar and pseudoscalar meson nonets and introduces the strange order parameter , @xmath175 , thus making both the phase structure and the dynamics more complex .",
    "the inclusion of strangeness is expected to have significant effects once the temperature exceeds the mass of the strange quark and thus it should not be ignored in dcc discussions .",
    "indeed , the crossover towards chiral symmetry is being pushed to higher temperatures , even for the non - strange order parameter @xmath0 , though the equilibrium value of @xmath0 is reduced when the @xmath0 mass is increased .",
    "consistent with this trend , the thermal masses of the 18 mesons then also become more similar .    by considering suitable idealized expansion scenarios , we have sought to ascertain the effect of the model extension on the non - equilibrium dynamics following a high - energy nuclear collision .",
    "the field fluctuations reflecting the presence of kaons are important for the dynamics and can not be neglected .",
    "furthermore , these calculations yield significant spectral enhancements not only for the pions ( as was the case in the su(2 ) description ) but also for the kaons ( though to a much smaller degree ) .",
    "we have pointed out that the neutral fraction @xmath81 of kaon emitted by a single dcc domain has a constant distribution , @xmath176 which is qualitatively as anomalous as the inverse square - root distribution @xmath75 governing the neutral fraction of dcc pions . relative to this latter distribution",
    ", the kaon distribution @xmath83 may be more amenable to measurement by suitable event - by - event analysis due to the fact that @xmath177 decays into charged pions .    finally , if chiral symmetry is approximately restored , the @xmath178 and @xmath179 equilibrium ratios are enhanced by factors of 2 - 3 due to the mass shifts of the mesons .",
    "if the expansion is sufficiently fast , this effect may be observable , even though the signal will be reduced by decaying resonances .",
    "the present investigation assumes that the coupling constants are temperature independent .",
    "a possible temperature dependence of the anomaly term will certainly change the meson mass spectrum at the higher temperatures , as well as the evolution of the order parameters and the effective masses .",
    "this will be studied in a forthcoming work .",
    "our present exploratory study suggest that various effects associated with the chiral phase transition in su(3 ) might be observable at rhic and we hope that our present findings will stimulate more elaborate investigations .",

    "<S> the su(3 ) extension of the linear sigma model is employed to elucidate the effect of including strangeness on the formation of disoriented chiral condensates . by means of a hartree factorization , </S>",
    "<S> approximate dispersion relations for the 18 scalar and pseudoscalar meson species are derived and their self - consistent solution makes it possible to trace out the thermal path of the two order parameters as well as delineate the region of instability within which spontaneous pair creation becomes possible . the results depend significantly on the employed sigma mass , with the highest values yielding the largest regions of instability . </S>",
    "<S> an approximate solution of the equations of motion for the order parameter in scenarios emulating uniform scaling expansions show that even with a rapid quench only the pionic modes grow unstable . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the rapid and oscillatory relaxation of the order parameters leads to enhanced production of both pions and ( to a lesser degree ) kaons . </S>"
