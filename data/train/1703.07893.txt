    "after the discovery of the higgs boson , the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations have continued searching for new exotic particles , such as the randall - sundrum spin-2 boson or new heavy scalar particles  @xcite .",
    "particularly , atlas collaboration is carrying out searches for new scalar resonances decaying into two photons .",
    "though up to the moment the searches for new scalar resonances has been fruitless , it is expected that the experimental collaborations atlas and cms continue the seek for new particles at the tev energy scale .",
    "these quests are supported by the improvements implemented in the cms and atlas detectors  @xcite along with the fact that the experimental collaborations have been able to develop a reliable detection machinery of spin-0 resonances .",
    "thus , the perspectives of searching for new physics phenomena at the tevs scale are hopeful .",
    "complementarily , several theoretical studies are found in the literature where the predictive power of extended models is tested via production of new - heavy neutral scalars decaying into standard model ( sm ) particles  @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned experimental results offer theoretical arguments to explore new physics process related with extended higgs sectors or sm extensions at the tev energy scale  @xcite . in this meaning , there exist many theoretical approaches that predict more content of scalar particles , such as the two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdms )  @xcite , three - higgs doublet model ( 3hdm )  @xcite , higgs - singlet extension model  @xcite , little higgs models ( lhms )  @xcite , etc . among the variety of lhms , the case of the littlest higgs model ( lthm ) is very interesting since it does no present new degrees of freedom beyond the sm under tev scale .",
    "additionally , the lthm has a reduced spectrum of new scalar particles  @xcite .",
    "as value added , this type of models offer a possible solution to hierarchy problem , which emerges when the higgs boson mass is affected by one - loop corrections .",
    "also , the lhms represents another approach to the electroweak symmetry breaking pattern  @xcite , based on the dimensional deconstruction  @xcite , where the quadratic divergences cancel .",
    "expressly , the quadratic divergence generated at the one - loop level because of the sm gauge bosons is canceled by the quadratic divergence introduced by the new gauge bosons at the same perturbative level . the one - loop quadratic divergence induced in the sm yukawa sector is eliminated by introducing new heavy fermions in such a way that the quadratic divergence coming from the sm top quark cancels . in lhms , in agreement with the breaking of the global symmetry at the energy scale of tevs , the new higgs field get mass becoming pseudo - goldstone bosons , where in addition a massless higgs arises .",
    "the quadratic - divergent corrections to the higgs boson mass show up at loop level , which assures a light higgs boson . with regard to lthm  @xcite ,",
    "the new particles arising at the tev energy scale are grouped in a new set of four gauge bosons with the same quantum numbers as the sm gauge bosons , namely , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , an exotic quark with the same charge as the sm top quark , and a new heavy scalar triplet , which contains six physical states : double - charged scalars @xmath13 , single - charged scalars @xmath14 , a neutral scalar @xmath15 , and a neutral pseudo scalar @xmath16 .",

    "therefore , it is interesting to deepen the analytical study of the transition amplitudes for these interactions .",
    "although the parameter space of the lthm has been severely restricted by the higgs discovery channels and electroweak precision observables  @xcite , our proposal could be of interest as far as of the search for new scalar particles refers .",
