    "the main idea of this work is to systematically study 4-manifolds that admit an @xmath5-action and classify them using seiberg - witten gauge theory . when the action on @xmath6 is free , the quotient by the @xmath5-action is a smooth 3-manifold @xmath7 and the manifold with given circle action is classified by the euler class @xmath8 . when the circle action is not free there will be non - trivial isotropy groups , which forces the orbit space to be an orbifold rather than a manifold .",
    "the main result of this paper is a formula for calculating the seiberg - witten invariants of any 4-manifold with a fixed point free circle action .",
    "we derive the formula by proving the existence of a diffeomorphism between the moduli space of the 4-manifold with the moduli space of the quotient 3-orbifold .",
    "a given manifold may admit more than one circle action .",
    "so while the 3-manifold and euler class are fully sufficient to classify a free circle action , the seiberg - witten invariants are stronger in that they are invariant of the underlying space up to diffeomorphism regardless of the circle action .",
    "the first theorem we prove puts a restriction on the set of @xmath9  structures with nontrivial seiberg - witten invariants for manifolds which admit a fixed point free circle action .",

    "this theorem is already enough to imply that @xmath12 is sw simple type  that the expected dimension of the moduli space for all @xmath9  structures with nontrivial invariants is zero .",
    "let @xmath15 be the projection map from a smooth 4-manifold with a fixed point free circle action to its quotient orbifold .",
    "the manifold @xmath12 can be thought of as a orbifold circle bundle over @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath16 is the connection 1-form of the circle bundle and @xmath17 is any orbifold metric , we can form the metric @xmath18 on @xmath12 .",
    "after perturbing the seiberg - witten equations on @xmath7 by a closed orbifold 2-form @xmath19 and on @xmath12 by its self - dual pullback @xmath20 , there is a moduli space of irreducible solutions to the seiberg - witten equations @xmath21 associated with @xmath12 and @xmath22 associated with @xmath7 ( see subsections [ sec : sw_eq_3_orb ] and [ sec : sw_eq_4_man ] for definitions ) .",

    "we can now state the main theorem of this paper :    the pullback map @xmath24 induces a homeomorphism @xmath25 furthermore , if either of the two moduli spaces is a smooth manifold , then both of them are smooth , and @xmath24 is a diffeomorphism .",
    "the approach to the proof of theorem b was inspired by similar work done in @xcite .",
    "as in the free case , a manifold with a fixed point free @xmath5-action can still be considered as a unit circle bundle , but now it is a unit circle bundle of an orbifold line bundle over a @xmath26-orbifold . in this setup , @xmath27 is replaced by a group called @xmath28 which records local data around the singular set ( see subsection [ sec : orb_line_bdle ] ) .",
    "our main results express the seiberg - witten invariants of @xmath12 in terms of the seiberg - witten invariants of the orbifold @xmath7 and the orbifold euler class @xmath29 :    let @xmath12 be a closed smooth @xmath1-manifold with @xmath30 and a fixed point free circle action .",
    "let @xmath31 be the orbifold quotient space and suppose that @xmath32 is the orbifold euler class of the circle action . if @xmath10 is a @xmath9  structure over @xmath12 with @xmath33 , then @xmath34 for some @xmath9  structure on @xmath7 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a well - defined element of @xmath28 . when @xmath3 , the formula holds for all @xmath9  structures pulled back from @xmath7 .",
    "this results produces two immediate corollaries .",
    "one is a corresponding formula for manifolds with free circle actions .",
    "this corollary is useful for calculating examples .",
    "the second corollary is a proof of the well known fact that the seiberg - witten invariants of @xmath37 are the same as the seiberg - witten invariants of @xmath31 .",
    "theorem c , together with the conjectured formula when @xmath12 contains fixed points ( see section [ sec : final_remarks ] ) , would completely calculate the seiberg - witten invariants for all @xmath38 4-manifolds with circle actions .",
    "these calculations are useful beyond just distinguishing manifolds . when seiberg - witten invariants are combined with c. taubes s results on symplectic manifolds ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , the formulas become an easy and powerful way of calculating an obstruction for an @xmath5-manifold to admit a symplectic structure .",
    "we use theorem b to study the moduli spaces in the case when @xmath14 .",
    "normally when @xmath14 , the seiberg - witten invariant depends on the `` chamber '' of the metric used to calculate it . a theorem of t. j. li and a. liu @xcite shows how the numerical invariant changes when the metric moves from one chamber into another . under certain conditions , their theorem says that the invariant does not change ( making it a diffeomorphism invariant again ) .",
    "we show how to construct an infinite number of @xmath39 manifolds with this property .",
    "theorem b provides a way to see explicitly why the invariants do not change when a chamber wall is crossed .",
