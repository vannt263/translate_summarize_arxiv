    "since the discovery of the first hot jupiter system @xcite and the subsequent realization that such systems are ubiquitous @xcite , astronomers have struggled to observe these planets and to compare these observations to theoretical predictions about their surface temperature variations , composition , albedo , and internal structure .",
    "the observation of extrasolar planetary transits , starting with hd  209458b @xcite , have allowed for the determination of the mass and size of these planets , but it was only with the observation of secondary eclipses , starting with hd  209458b @xcite and tres-1 @xcite , that it has been possible to measure the flux from these planets ( for a review of transiting exoplanet science see * ? ? ?",
    "the depth of the secondary eclipse , however , only characterizes the day - side flux from the planet . to fully characterize the planet s longitudinal temperature profile ,",
    "observations must be made at a variety of planetary phases .",
    "the first such observations were reported by @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present similar observations of three other planetary systems .",
    "we briefly review models of hot jupiter phase variations in  1.2 and  1.3 , and the observational constraints in  1.4 . in ",
    "2 we present our observations and in  3 we explain how they constrain the properties of hot jupiters .",
    "we state our conclusions in  4 .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , the phase function of a planetary system is taken to be the relative flux contribution from the planet as a function of its orbital position . here",
    "we describe a toy model of hot jupiter phase functions , based on a planet in a circular orbit with two isothermal hemispheres and neglecting the planet s remnant heat of formation , an effective temperature of @xmath14 5075  k @xcite .",
    "the bond albedo , @xmath15 , is the fraction of the incident stellar flux that is reflected by the planet .",
    "a planet s energy budget is largely determined by its bond albedo .",
    "hence , if we treat the host star as a blackbody , the equilibrium temperature of a planet s day and night faces is , respectively @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the star s radius and effective temperature , @xmath20 is the planet s semi - major axis and @xmath21 quantifies the portion of the absorbed stellar energy advected to the planet s night - side ( @xmath22 for no redistribution ; @xmath23 for full redistribution ) @xcite .",
    "the depth of secondary eclipse ( for edge - on systems ) is approximately the ratio of the planet s day - side flux , @xmath24 , to the stellar flux , @xmath25 . in light of the models of @xcite",
    ", we assume that the planet s day and night - side radiate as blackbodies ( @xmath26 ) and that the host star emits with a mid - ir brightness temperature @xmath27 ( we use @xmath28 at 8  @xmath0 m based on the models of * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting planet - star flux ratio is : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the planetary radius and the ratios @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be well - constrained if the planet transits its host star .",
    "the wavelength - dependent geometric albedo , @xmath33 , is the ratio of the total brightness of the planet at full phase to that of a lambertian disk with the same cross - section",
    ". the second term ( thermal emission from the planet ) can be neglected at optical wavelengths .    in the infrared , we may neglect the contribution from reflected starlight .",
    "the peak - to - trough amplitude of the phase function for a transiting systems then becomes : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the flux from the planet s night - side and where we have neglected the planet s flux contribution ( @xmath36% ) in the denominator .",
    "note that the absolute flux from the planet is a minimum during the secondary eclipse , irrespective of phase variations , since the planet is entirely hidden from view at that time .",
    "the normalized phase variations , @xmath37 , for a system with inclination @xmath38 is : @xmath39 where the @xmath40 is the planet s orbital phase ( @xmath41 at inferior conjunction ; @xmath42 at superior conjunction ) and @xmath43 is the time - averaged flux of the system .",
    "measurements of secondary eclipse depth thus constrain a combination of @xmath15 , @xmath33 and @xmath21 in this toy model .",
    "observations of the phase function amplitude constrain these same parameters , as well as @xmath44 and @xmath30 in the case of non - transiting systems .",
    "in addition to the toy model outlined above , there have been numerous more sophisticated attempts to model the atmospheres of hot jupiters and thus to predict the depth of secondary eclipses as well as the full phase function of specific extrasolar systems .",
    "we summarize the most pertinent aspects of these models here ( for a more thorough background see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite determine energy recirculation and predict global temperature contrasts of @xmath45500 k at the photosphere .",
    "they also predict a noticeable offset between the phase function peak and the time of opposition .",
    "@xcite construct models with either no or full recirculation and find that the latter is a better fit to secondary eclipse observations .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite also run simulations with different amounts of recirculation and find that significant redistribution of heat must be occurring to explain the observations .",
    "@xcite run models to calculate emitted spectra as a function of orbital phase for both equilibrium and non - equilibrium chemistry .",
    "they find that non - equilibrium chemistry leads to significantly smaller phase variations and that current observations can be explained with a blackbody - like planetary spectrum .",
    "finally , @xcite use the factor @xmath21 to characterize the efficiency of energy recirculation and construct models for five different values of the parameter .",
    "they find that current observations rule out models with no recirculation and are in fact consistent with full recirculation ( although they admit that current observations are not precise enough to determine the exact degree of recirculation ) .",
    "secondary eclipses have been reported for four short - period extrasolar planetary systems and a phase function has been reported in a different , non - transiting system .",
    "we summarize these results below .",
    "@xcite placed an upper limit of @xmath46 on the relative secondary eclipse depth at 2.2  @xmath0 m using the spex instrument at the nasa infrared telescope facility . the secondary eclipse of hd  209458 , observed with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) yielded a relative depth at 24  @xmath0 m of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "similarly , the secondary eclipse of tres-1 was observed in the irac 4.5 and 8  @xmath0 m bands , yielding eclipse depths of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the latest system to have been detected in secondary eclipse is hd  189733 @xcite .",
    "observations with the spitzer infrared spectrograph ( irs ) peak - up imager at 16  @xmath0 m give an eclipse depth of @xmath50 .",
    "in addition to infrared detections , the non - detection of a secondary eclipse for hd  209458 at optical wavebands has constrained the 500 nm secondary eclipse depth to be less than @xmath51 at the @xmath6 level and less than @xmath52 at the @xmath53 level @xcite .",
    "ground - based k - band ( 2.2  @xmath0 m ) observations of ogle - tr-113b tentatively show a secondary eclipse depth of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "mips 24  @xmath0 m imaging of @xmath55 andromeda has yielded a phase function with peak - to - trough amplitude of @xmath56 and weak evidence of a small phase offset @xcite .",
    "this surprisingly large amplitude suggests that the planet has parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "continuous irac 8  @xmath0 m monitoring of hd  189733 for half of a planetary orbit led to the detection of a phase function with a peak - to - trough amplitude of 0.00121(4 ) @xcite .",
    "this modest phase function , roughly one third the relative depth of secondary eclipse , indicates that much of the incident stellar energy is being recirculated to the planet s night side .",
    "@xcite used irs to obtain a mid - ir spectrum for hd  189733b , which showed no evidence for absorption bands due to either water or methane . @xcite",
    "obtained the relative mid - ir spectrum of hd  209458b and similarly concluded that such absorption features could be excluded ; they also identified candidate emission features at two wavelengths .",

    "this observation began at mjd = 53728.447 , or @xmath60 .",
    "each point represents 64 exposures , each of 0.1 sec .",
    "the error bars , which have an average value of @xmath61 , correspond to the standard deviation in the counts from the 64 images . for comparison",
    ", one would expect uncertainties of roughly @xmath62 in the poisson noise regime.,width=317 ]",
    "we acquired spitzer photometry with the irac 3.6  @xmath0 m or 4.5  @xmath0 m , and 8  @xmath0 m detectors in sub - array mode ( 32@xmath6332 pixels , or 38.3@xmath6338.3 arcseconds ) to avoid saturation @xcite .",
    "observations were made at eight different phases for each planetary system with follow - on time constraints .",
    "each observation consists of four nods to the target star interleaved with four nods to a nearby flux standard of comparable infrared brightness .",
    "the number and duration of exposures for each of our targets are summarized in table  [ results ] .",
    "we convert fluxes from the spitzer units of specific intensity ( mjy / sr ) to photon counts , and use aperture photometry to recover the counts for the science and standard stars .",
    "we determine the psf centroid using a centre - of - light function , then use the idl routine aper to extract the source flux .",
    "after testing many combinations of aperture and sky annulus radii for robustness , we settle on a 7 pixel aperture radius and a sky annulus centred on the target star , with an inner radius of 10 pixels and an outer radius of 15 pixels .",
    "a single observation lasts only 20 minutes , compared to planetary orbital periods of days , so the flux is not expected to vary noticeably within a single observation .",
    "unfortunately , the measured signal in the 3.6  @xmath0 m and 4.5  @xmath0 m bands exhibits large ( few % ) fluctuations .",
    "the pointing drifts between nods are sub - pixel yet other researchers have found that the irac 4.5  @xmath0 m insb array shows significant intra - pixel sensitivity variations @xcite .",
    "the 3.6  @xmath0 m detector , also an insb array , likely suffers from the same problem .",
    "we do not have sufficient images to properly map out the position - sensitivity relation , and this severely limits the quality of our 3.6  @xmath0 m and 4.5  @xmath0 m data .",
    "the 8  @xmath0 m observations of 51  peg and hd  179949 show a smooth increase in gain , with a similar shape for both the science target and flux standard , indicating an instrumental effect , as shown in figure  [ 51peg_ch4_observation_2 ] .",
    "hd  209458 , a somewhat fainter source , does not exhibit such a marked ramp - up .",
    "the illumination - dependent nature of this instrumental effect , described in greater detail in @xcite , is consistent with charge trapping , in that pixel sensitivities are initially deficient but asymptote to a constant value as the pixels are illuminated repeatedly .    for each observation , we determine the total counts by multiplying the median count by the number of frames , thus ignoring the minority of frames affected by cosmic rays .",
    "we repeat this median averaging for all the exposures within each nod ( with duration @xmath64 ) and take the standard deviation in the counts from each exposure multiplied by the square - root of the number of exposures per nod to be the uncertainty in the total counts .",
    "we find these uncertainties to be 45 times larger than the expectation from poisson noise at 3.6  @xmath0 m and 4.5  @xmath0 m , and roughly twice poisson noise at 8  @xmath0 m . at the shorter wavebands , as well as for the 8  @xmath0 m observations of hd  209458 ,",
    "the points from different nods show considerable scatter but no obvious trend , so we add up the counts from all the nods separately for the science and reference star , then take the ratio of the two sums to determine the relative flux at that epoch . noticing that the ramp - up at 8  @xmath0 m for 51  peg and hd  179949 levels off towards the end of any given observation",
    ", we take the ratio of the summed counts for the two final nods as the relative flux at that epoch . in all cases",
