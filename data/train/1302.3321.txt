    "currently , the most straightforward method for increasing the number of known transiting super - earths around bright stars is to monitor the host stars of rv - discovered exoplanets with minimum masses in the super - earth regime during their predicted times of inferior conjunction relative to the earth .",
    "the planet 55 cnc e is the first super - earth whose transiting nature was discovered in this way .",
    "the host star of this system is a very bright ( @xmath3 ) g8 dwarf , and 55 cnc e orbits it in only 0.74 days .",
    "the transit detection was achieved independently with the most space telescope ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* winn et al . 2011 ) ) and with the nasa spitzer infrared space telescope detection ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* demory et al . 2011 ) ) .    beyond the transit detection ,",
    "both instruments have revealed further properties of this system and its innermost , transiting planet .",
    "the most light curve hinted at out - of - transit variations in phase with 55 cnc e s orbit .",
    "the modulation , whose amplitude is too large to be due to reflected light from 55 cnc e , may instead indicate the existence of tidal or magnetic interactions between the planet and its host star .",
    "spitzer was employed to observe four occurrences of the planet s secondary eclipse using its 4.5 @xmath4 m channel , from which a brightness temperature of 2360 @xmath5 300 k was determined ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* demory et al . 2012 ) ) .",
    "the authors propose that the measured brightness temperature may suggest inefficient heat redistribution combined with a low albedo , but that it is also possible that the 4.5 @xmath4 m observations probe a deeper layer in the planet s atmosphere , thus potentially indicating the presence of a thermal inversion layer .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* crossfield ( 2012 ) ) obtained nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) spectroscopic observations of 55 cnc a and derived an improved flux density for the star , leading to a re - estimate of the spitzer data - based brightness temperature of 55 cnc e. from these measurements , he obtains a slightly lower temperature of 1950@xmath6 k for the planet , which expands the range of possible albedo values consistent with this temperature .    in this proceedings , we describe the acquisition and reduction of new most observations aimed at searching for the secondary eclipse of 55 cnc e , verifying whether the previously observed phase variations persist , and improving the physical and orbital parameters of this transiting super - earth in section  [ sec:55obs ] .",
    "55 cnc was observed nearly continuously using the most space telescope for about 42 days from 2012 january 14 to february 25 .",
    "the observations were acquired in direct imaging mode with an exposure time of 0.5 s per individual frame .",
    "the images were downloaded from the satellite in stacks of 80 frames , resulting in a total integration time of 40 s per data point .",

    "the magnitudes were fitted to a linear function of sky background and x - position polynomials .",

    "the remaining routine correction is the filtering of straylight variations modulated with the satellite s orbit of 101.4 minutes .",
    "this was accomplished by dividing the light curve into 21 sections approximately 2 days long each , folding each section at the satellite s orbital period and computing a running average of this phased data .",
    "we then removed the resulting waveform from that section of light curve .",
    "the final light curve contains 62 337 points and is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig:55all ] .",
    "we used a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm to analyze the most photometry with the goals of improving the values of the transit and orbital parameters of 55 cnc e and searching for the out - of - transit variation originally observed in 2011 ( ( * ? ? ? * winn et al .",
    "2011 ) ) as well as the secondary eclipse .",
    "for model comparison , we use the odds ratio . the bayesian information criterion ( bic )",
    "is used as an estimate of the marginal likelihood for each model ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* carlin & louis 2009 ) ) .",
    "we fitted the following eight parameters : the orbital period ( @xmath7 ) , the mid - transit time ( @xmath8 ) , the ratio of the planet to star radii ( @xmath9 ) , the scaled semi - major axis ( @xmath10 ) , the orbital inclination ( @xmath11 ) , the depth of the secondary eclipse ( @xmath12 ) , the amplitude of the orbital phase modulation assuming a sinusoidal function with its minimum coinciding with the mid - transit time ( @xmath13 ) and a normalisation factor corresponding to the flux just outside of transit ( @xmath14 ) . including quadratic limb - darkening coefficients in our fit",
    "did not improve the odds ratio , suggesting the limb - darkening is not well constrained by our photometry .",
    "these two parameters were thus held fixed at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the most bandpass values for the grid point of stellar parameters ( @xmath17 k , @xmath18 , @xmath19 = 0.2 $ ] ; a. prsa , private communication ) nearest to those of 55 cnc .",
    "gaussian priors were used for @xmath7 and @xmath10 , and uniform priors for the remaining floating parameters .",
    "we carried out a mcmc analysis of the combined 2011 and 2012 light curves .",
    "the results of this analysis are listed in column 1 of table  [ tab:55cncprops2 ] .",
    "while we do not detect a significant non - zero secondary eclipse , we are able to use the best - fitted value of @xmath12 and its uncertainties to place an upper limit on its depth . because fitting for the secondary eclipse does not improve the model likelihood , we also ran the mcmc analysis omitting this parameter in order to obtain improved uncertainties on the remaining parameters .",
    "the results can be seen in column 2 of table  [ tab:55cncprops2 ] .",
    "for all parameters but @xmath12 the column of interest is therefore column 2 .",

    "* gillon et al . ( 2011 ) ) examined two plausible compositions which match their mass and radius measurements for 55 cnc e : an envelope consisting of 0.1% h / he by mass and one consisting of 20% h@xmath25o by mass .",
    "they argue , based on the calculations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* valencia et al . ( 2010 ) ) , that the former would evaporate within a few million years . a water vapour envelope",
    "would also be depleted over time , but only very slowly ; the process is expected to take several billion years . given the estimated age of the star ( @xmath26 gyr ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* von braun et al . 2011 ) ) , a water vapour atmosphere is by far the more likely scenario .",
    "our value for the radius of 55 cnc e is consistent with this model .",
    "* winn et al . (",
    "2011 ) ) suggested the phase modulation discovered in the 2011 most photometry , too large to be explained by scattered light from the planet , could be attributed to star - exoplanet magnetic interaction .",
    "because the orbital motion of the planet and the stellar rotation are likely not synchronised ( the best estimate of the stellar rotation period is @xmath2743 days ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fischer et al . 2008 ) ) , we do not expect interaction manifesting itself as a region of star spots and chromospheric activity fixed in the co - rotating frame of the star at the sub - planetary point , but rather a travelling wave moving through the photosphere and chromosphere of the star .",
    "such an effect can naturally be expected to have a changing amplitude , and in fact that is what ( * ? ? ? * gillon et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ) found in their re - analysis of the most 2011 photometry .",
    "when folding the entire 2012 most light curve , we do not find a phase variation at the period of 55 cnc e as strong as that present in the 2011 light curve .",
    "this motivated us to inspect the 2012 data set more closely and , while always smaller than in the 2011 data , the amplitude of the phase variation does appear to change over the course of the observations .",
    "interestingly , if we fold in phase the photometry only between hjd 2455945 ( near the end of the portion of the light curve more affected by stray light modulation ) and hjd 2455969 , we find the amplitude of the phase variation ( @xmath28 ppm ) is about twice what we find by folding the entire data set .",

    "we can express the ratio of the planet - to - star fluxes ( @xmath31 ) as a function of the geometric albedo @xmath32 ( the fraction of light reflected or scattered by the planet at optical wavelengths ) , planetary radius and semi - major axis :    @xmath33    a geometric albedo of 1 ( 100% reflective ) means the eclipse could be no deeper than 30 ppm .",
    "our upper limit on @xmath12 leads to an upper limit ( 1@xmath24 ) of 0.57 on the geometric albedo .",
