    "high energy tails are generic for the velocity distributions of fluidized granular media , i.e. low density systems of macroscopic particles performing inelastic interactions .",
    "contrary to the specific shape of the tail which depends on the details of the grains , overpopulation seems to be a general feature of inelastic systems , which expresses their deep non - equilibrium nature .",
    "recently , classes of simplified models , the so - called inelastic maxwell models ( imm ) have been introduced .",
    "these models derive from a mathematical simplification of the non - linear boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres , assuming that the collision rate may be replaced by an average rate , independent of the relative velocity of the colliding particles .",
    "this model introduces mathematical simplifications which may help to highlight the origin of the anomalous velocity distributions and serve as a simple tool to study far - from - equilibrium systems . quoting m.h .",
    "ernst , one can consider that `` what harmonic oscillators are for quantum mechanics and dumb - bells for polymer physics , is what elastic and inelastic maxwell models are for kinetic theory , '' ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "usually , people focus on two kinds of solutions of the inelastic boltzmann equation , namely scaling solutions describing the approach towards total rest state and heated stationary solutions . in the following , however , we focus on another class of solutions of inelastic gases , which are stationary states of the unforced case . before going further , let us point the recent exhaustive study of ben - naim and machta ( ref.@xcite ) , that focuses independently on the same issue .",
    "our analysis is done in the context of the one - dimensional imm , where we show that stable lvy distributions play a central role .",
    "the reasons for studying these stationary lvy velocity distributions are multiple .",
    "first , they correspond to exact solutions for an inelastic gas , and this fact is very rare . by discussing the physical relevance of these states , whose mean energy diverges , we show that there exists physical solutions which are very close to these stationary states and which may be considered _",
    "quasi stationary_. this paper is also motivated by the revived interest regarding generalized thermodynamical equilibrium theories .",
    "indeed , long tail distributions have been found in diverse fields of science and are the object of a growing number of researches . from the point of view of statistical physics , several attempts",
    "have been made in order to show physical mechanisms underlying these anomalous behaviours , such as tsallis s non - extensive entropy - based statistics ( ref.@xcite).the study of the above lvy distributions could help to build a thermodynamic - like foundation to processes such as anomalous diffusion , fractal dynamics ... this problem , which has first been questioned by montroll and schlesinger ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , has recently lead to study simple kinetic models in order to show equilibrium - like features of lvy distributions ( ref .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . in this work",
    ", we will also discuss the range of validity of such lvy states , and show that they are limited to the context of maxwell - like kinetic models .",
    "the one - dimensional imm has been first introduced by ben - naim and krapivsky ( ref.@xcite ) , and derives from a simplification of the boltzmann equation for inelastic hard rods .",
    "the collision rule between grains 1 and 2 reads :    @xmath0    where the prime velocities are the pre - collisional velocities .",
    "the inelasticity is accounted through the so - called normal restitution coefficient @xmath1 restricted to the interval [ 0:1 ] .",
    "standard procedures , such as molecular chaos hypothesis , lead to the one - dimensional inelastic boltzmann equation .",
    "the imm follows after the replacement of the collision rate by an average rate and a rescaling of the time scale :    @xmath2    where one has furthermore assumed that the system is and remain homogeneous in the course of time .",
    "finite energy solutions of ( [ imm ] ) have a natural tendency to reach the asymptotic solution @xmath3 , expressing the natural cooling down due to the dissipative interactions .",
    "these solutions have been proven to exhibit multiscaling ( ref.@xcite ) , i.e the system is characterized by an infinite set of independent cooling rates . moreover , as shown by baldassarri et al .",
    "( ref.@xcite ) , multiscaling leads to a power law scaling velocity solution .",
    "it is well known that the maxwell like collision operator of ( 2 ) is very similar to a convolution process ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this property is clear after using the bobylev fourier transform method to the kinetic equation :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the characteristic function of the velocity distribution , defined by : @xmath6 .",
    "this expression reveals the mechanisms which dominate the long time dynamics of the kinetic model .",
    "indeed , the evolution of @xmath7 is determined by the values of @xmath5 for @xmath8 ( this comes directly from the inequalities @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "consequently , as time increases , @xmath7 is determined by the initial condition @xmath11 for smaller and smaller values of @xmath12 and , in the long time limit , the characteristic functions are dominated by their initial behaviour at @xmath13 . if the initial energy diverges , and if the small k development writes @xmath14 , one easily shows that @xmath15 , i.e. the quantity @xmath16 describing the small k singularity of @xmath17 is a constant of motion . in that case , the stationary solution of ( [ boby ] ) is the lvy distribution : @xmath18 which , in velocity space rewrites : @xmath19 let us stress that this class of states is characterized by an infinite energy , a condition which is a priori necessary in order to make compatible the inelasticity of the interactions and the stationarity of the velocity distribution .",
    "moreover , analogies with the central - limit theorem suggest that ( [ levyvelocity ] ) is the asymptotic stationary solution for a large class of initial distributions , thereby drawing a parallel with the maxwell - boltzmann equilibrium distribution ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "one should also remark that the quantity @xmath16 also shares some properties with an equilibrium temperature , such as the equipartition property in the case of mixtures ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we would like to discuss the physical relevance of the stationary lvy velocity distributions derived in the previous section . at first sight",
    ", the only physical stationary solution should be the total rest state , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , with a=0 ) , because an infinite average energy for the velocity distribution sounds unphysical .",
    "it is nonetheless interesting to point out that , despite this infinite average behaviour , each realization of the statistical process is finite , i.e. each particle carries a finite but unbounded energy .",
    "moreover , physical systems are composed by a finite number of constituents . combining these two remarks",
    ", one expects that the average energy of a physical system is finite and decreases because of dissipation according to haff law : @xmath22 , even if its velocities are initially lvy distributed . in order to understand this paradox ,",
    "we have performed computer simulations of the inelastic maxwell model .",
    "this can be achieved by using the usual stochastic interpretation of the boltzmann equation ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "to do so , we initially distribute velocities according to a lorentz distribution , and check that the energy of the system decreases like the exponential law prescribed by theory .",
    "the velocity distribution function is also shown to converge towards the dirac delta distribution in the long time limit , as expected .",
    "in contrast , a careful study of the evolution of the core of the velocity distribution shows that it remains stationary during a non - negligible time interval ( fig .",
    "[ dist ] ) .",
    "this property , together with the finiteness of the number of particles , allows one to make a link between the imm and truncated lvy distributions ( tld ) .",
    "this family of distributions has been introduced by mantegna and stanley ( ref .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) in order to justify the use of lvy - like distributions in finite - size systems .",
    "they are defined by :    @xmath23    where l is the cutoff length and @xmath24 is the lvy distribution of order @xmath25 defined to be the inverse fourier transform of @xmath26 . in a simulation of the imm ,",
    "the cut - off length is naturally imposed by the upper boundary value of the energy of the particles . in order to evaluate the stationarity of the lvy core distribution ,",
    "we have measured the evolution of @xmath27 .",
    "asymptotically , this variable should behave like @xmath28 , which is predicted from the scaling solution of baldassari ( ref.@xcite ) . in the simulations ,",
    "we observe the transition between two linear regimes in logarithmic scale ( fig .",
    "[ transition ] ) : an initial regime during which @xmath27 is constant which corresponds to the quasi stationary regime of the core of the velocity distribution , and a linearly increasing regime , which comes from the energy decrease in the system .",
    "amazingly , while @xmath27 increased of only ten percent during ten mean collision times , the energy decreased by a factor 100 during the same time period .",
    "as a conclusion , we would like to discuss the range of validity of the stationary velocity distributions described above .",
    "indeed , the inelastic maxwell model studied in this paper is exceptional because of its strong similarities with random walk theory , which do not apply in general to more complex kinetic models.therefore , it is important to recall a qualitative difference between elastic and inelastic systems , namely the fact that the asymptotic solutions of inelastic gases depend on their modeling while elastic systems always converge towards the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "this universality relies on the conservation of energy and on the time symmetric dynamics of elastic systems .",
    "altogether , these properties imply the emergence of detailed balance at equilibrium .",
    "in contrast , it is straightforward to prove that stationary lvy distributions do not exhibit detailed balance ( ref.@xcite ) , thereby showing the dependence of the stationary solution on the collisional kernel .",
    "this result confirms that lvy distributions are associated to a summation of random variables , while the gaussian also arises from more general principles .",
    "nevertheless , maxwell models constitute an ideal framework , due to their mathematical simplicity , in order to study non - trivial features of the boltzmann equation , such as non - equipartition of energy in inelastic mixtures , or infinite energy solutions of the elastic case ( ref .",
    "moreover , they lead to a natural derivation of fractional fokker - planck equations ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and to the emergence of lvy distributions , whose interest in physics is therefore enhanced . in this paper",
    ", we also discussed the physical relevance of such infinite mean energy solutions by performing computer simulations of the model .",
    "given the finiteness of the number of particles in the system , we showed that these solutions are equivalent to truncated lvy velocity distributions , i.e. to a finite mean energy solution .",
    "it is important to stress that such a solution emerges from the dynamics itself , and not from an ad hoc assumption for the truncature .",
    "moreover , computer simulations indicate that , while the total energy decays exponentially fast , as predicted by theory , the core of the distribution remains stationary during an arbitrary long period of time .",
    "finally , we would like to point the recent work by ben - naim and machta ( ref.@xcite ) , who propose an experimental realization of infinite energy steady states by injecting energy at large velocities .",
    "this experiment should open new perspectives in kinetic theory , and motivate detailed studies of this family of solutions .",
