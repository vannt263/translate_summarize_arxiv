    "the reflection and refraction of light at the plane surface of a transparent medium , such as the still water of a placid lake , are well - known phenomena . as a matter of fact , the _ law of reflection _",
    "was already enunciated by euclid of alexandria ( fl . @xmath0 bc ) in his book _",
    "catoptrics_. @xcite nowadays , extended expositions of this subject may be found in standard optics textbooks .",
    "@xcite    less well - known is the fact that when the light has the form of a beam with a finite transverse ( i.e. , orthogonal to the direction of propagation ) extent , the reflected beam appears shifted with respect to a ray traveling parallel to the beam but reflected according to the laws of _ geometrical optics _ , as opposed to the laws of _ wave optics _ obeyed by the finite beam . a cartoon - like representation of this phenomenon is presented in fig .",
    "1 .     illustration of a beam - shift process .",
    "the _ incident _ beam travels along with the ray represented by the unit vector @xmath1 .",
    "reflection transforms @xmath1 according to the laws of geometrical optics into @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a unit vector normal to the reflecting surface .",
    "the _ reflected _ beam travels parallel the unit vector @xmath4 which is both displaced and tilted with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 denote , respectively , the projections onto the plane of the surface of the beam displacements parallel and orthogonal to the plane of incidence spanned by @xmath1 and @xmath3 . ]",
    "such a shift may have both a spatial and an angular character , namely the reflected beam may be both _ displaced _ and _ deflected _ with respect to the geometrical ray . depending on whether these spatial and angular shifts occur in either the plane of incidence or in a direction orthogonal to this plane , they are denoted as either goos - hnchen ( gh ) or imbert - fedorov ( if ) shifts .",
    "analogous shifts also occur for the refracted beam .",
    "all these shifts are very small compared to the transverse extent of the beam , typically a few wavelengths the spatial shifts , and from micro- to milli - radians the angular ones .",
    "interestingly enough , the first who conjectured that the center of a beam of light should manifest a tiny spatial shift in the plane of incidence when reflected , was isaac newton in the 17th century .",
    "@xcite    detailed theoretical derivations of both gh and if shifts may be found in the current literature for surfaces of different types ( dielectric , metallic , multilayered , et cetera ) , and for light beams of vary shapes ( hermite - gauss , laguerre - gauss , bessel , et cetera ) .",
    "the interested reader may consult refs .",
    "5 - 8 for early expositions and refs .",
    "9 - 15 for more accessible modern treatments of the subject . from these studies",
    "it emerges that , given a specific reflecting surface , beams of different shapes yield shifts of different extent .",
    "for example , for an air - to - glass interface , a fundamental gaussian beam produces qualitatively and quantitatively different gh and if shifts with respect to a laguerre - gauss beam impinging upon the same surface .",
    "this could appear not so surprising because a laguerre - gauss beam carries an intrinsic orbital angular momentum while a fundamental gaussian beam does not .",
    "@xcite thus , one might conclude that orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of light affects the physics of beam - shift phenomena . more generally ,",
    "since such oam is determined solely by the spatial profile of the beam , one may wonder to what extent the beam shape determines the values of both gh and if shifts .",
    "unfortunately , prevailing discussions in the current literature tend to obscure the distinction between the beam - shape dependent and independent aspects of beam - shift phenomena because conventional evaluations of gh and if shifts rest on the direct calculation of the centroid of the intensity distribution of the reflected beam .",
    "such a distribution depends , as a whole , upon _ both _ the shape of the beam _ and _ the material composition of the surface .",
    "thus , beam - shape dependent and independent characteristics of shift phenomena deceptively appear to be intrinsically tied .    in this article",
    "we present a novel way to describe the gh and if shifts , with the aim to provide significantly new insights about these phenomena . to this end , a simple treatment that renders a clear separation between the beam - shape dependent and independent features of beam - reflection processes is presented and developed .",
    "such separation naturally leads to find some `` universal '' characteristics of the beam - shape dependent facets of the problem .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the conventional theory of gh and if shifts is reviewed and expressions for the beam - shape independent parts of these shifts are explicitly given . in sec .",
    "iii and iv a new treatment based on the study of the functional shape of the beam is introduced and illustrated . finally , in sec .",
    "v , consequences of the preceding results are discussed .",

    "the two complex amplitudes @xmath31 and @xmath32 define the polarization of the beam and the complex scalar function @xmath33 fixes the spatial shape of the beam .",
    "for example , @xmath33 may either be a hermite - gauss function or a laguerre - gauss function , both types being widely utilized in optics .",
    "@xcite    when the beam is reflected its analytic signal @xmath34 changes into @xmath35 , where @xcite @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the fresnel reflection coefficients evaluated at the incident angle @xmath38 .",

    "however , they are _ completely _ independent from the shape of the beam @xmath33 . the reader should notice and keep in mind this important fact .",
    "equations and are valid under the assumption that the reflection does not strongly distort the beam .",
    "such deformation occurs , for example , when the beam impinges at the brewster angle @xcite for which one has @xmath44 and @xmath45 becomes ill - defined ; in this case a special treatment is required .",
    "@xcite    for monochromatic light the intensity of the reflected beam is given by : @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the vacuum permittivity and permeability , @xcite respectively , and    [ intpo ] @xmath49    are the intensity distribution functions for the reflected light with polarization parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence , respectively .    the center of the reflected beam may be evaluated as the centroid in the @xmath50 plane of the total intensity distribution @xmath51 .",
    "the position of such centroid with respect to the origin @xmath52 on the plane @xmath53 , defines both the spatial and angular gh and if shifts in the following way .",
    "given the cartesian components @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the centroid of the beam defined as : @xmath56 then the spatial ( @xmath57 ) and angular ( @xmath58 ) gh and if shifts are conventionally _ defined _ as :    [ ghandifshifts ] @xmath59    note that in eq . and hereafter the integration symbol `` @xmath60 '' _ always _ denotes definite double integrals over the whole @xmath50 plane with @xmath61 kept constant . moreover , the fact that @xmath62 and @xmath63 are strictly independent from @xmath61 ( see , e. g. , ref .",
    "22 ) is also worth noticing .",
    "it is easy to see that after a straightforward algebraic manipulation eq .",
    "can be recast in the following simple form : @xmath64 where the _ weight _ coefficient @xmath65 is defined as : @xmath66 and the _ relative _ shift as : @xmath67 the corresponding formulae for @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be obtained from eqs .",

    "the non - negative weight coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 give the fraction of the reflected light which is linearly polarized in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence , respectively .",
    "the relative shifts @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the first moments of the distributions @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and represent the displacements of the intensity distributions that would be detected behind a polarizer oriented along @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , at distance @xmath61 from the origin .    at this point ,",
    "conventional calculations require substitution of eqs . into eq . and subsequent straightforward integration , either analytical for a few simple cases , or numerical for the more complicated ones .",
    "@xcite however , as announced in the introduction , such procedure leads to a confusion , in determining gh and if shifts , between the role played by the _ functional _ shape @xmath79 of the beam on one side , and the role played by the beam - shape independent shifts @xmath39 and @xmath40 on the other side .",
    "this issue will be clarified in sec .",
    "iii and practically illustrated in sec .",
    "in order to elucidate the problem posed at the end of the previous section , a seemingly more abstract issue is illustrated here to the reader in some detail : given an _",

    "much more interesting is the second term .",
    "the diagonal elements of the @xmath114 matrix @xmath115 connect the imaginary parts of the complex shifts @xmath86 and @xmath87 with the real displacements of the distribution . since from eq .",

    "the existence of these nonzero off - diagonal matrix elements is a remarkable _ universal _ feature of shifted distributions .",

    "the main result presented in this paper perhaps consists in the following recipe for the calculation of gh and if shifts : use the conventional theory to calculate the _ beam - shape independent _ complex beam shifts @xmath137 and @xmath138 , for your peculiar surface .",
    "they depend upon both the polarization of the beam and the material composition of the reflecting surface , but are _ totally _ independent from the shape of the beam .",
    "then , by using eq . , calculate the matrix @xmath115 for your specific beam .",
    "finally , combine the previous results into eq . to obtain the desired shifts .",
    "apart from its great practical usefulness , this new approach has the important conceptual advantage over the traditional beam - shift computational methods , that it permits to isolate in a completely unambiguous manner the beam - shape dependent contributions to the shifts .",
    "this separation is relevant whenever one wants to understand how the degrees of freedom carried by the wavefront of the beam ( as , e.g. , the oam of the beam ) , enter in the numerous beam - shift physical phenomena .",

    "<S> when a beam of light is reflected by a smooth surface its behavior deviates from geometrical optics predictions . </S>",
    "<S> such deviations are quantified by the so - called spatial and angular goos - hnchen ( gh ) and imbert - fedorov ( if ) shifts of the reflected beam . </S>",
    "<S> these shifts depend upon the shape of the incident beam , its polarization and on the material composition of the reflecting surface . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a novel approach that allows one to unambiguously isolate the beam - shape dependent aspects of gh and if shifts . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this separation is possible as a result of some universal features of shifted distribution functions which are presented and discussed . </S>"
