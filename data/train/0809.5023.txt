    "random multiple access protocols have played a crucial role in the development of both wired and wireless local area networks ( lans ) , and yet the performance of even the simplest of these protocols , such as slotted - aloha @xcite , is still not clearly understood .",
    "these protocols have generated a lot of research interest in the last thirty years , especially recently in attempts to use multi - hop wireless networks ( mesh and adhoc networks ) to provide low - cost high - speed access to the internet .",
    "random multiple access protocols allow users to share a resource ( e.g. a radio channel in wireless lans ) in a distributed manner without exchanging any signaling messages .",
    "a crucial question is to determine whether these protocols are efficient and fair , or whether they require significant improvements .    in this paper , we consider non - adaptive protocols , where the transmission probability of a given transmitter is basically fixed .",
    "more specifically we analyze the behavior the slotted - aloha protocol in a buffered system with a fixed number of users receiving packets from independent markovian processes of pre - defined intensities .",
    "we aim at characterizing the stability region of the system .",
    "this question has been open since the first stability analysis of aloha systems in 1979 by tsybakov and mikhailov @xcite , and we will shortly explain why it is so challenging to solve .",
    "we propose an approximate stability region and prove that it is exact when the number of users grows large . to accomplish this , we characterize the mean field regime of the system when the number of users is large , explore the stability of this limiting regime , and finally explain how the stability of the mean field regime relates to the ergodicity of systems with a finite number of users .",
    "we also show , using both theoretical arguments and numerical results , that our approximate is extremely accurate even for small systems , e.g. with three users ( the approximate is actually exact for two users ) .",
    "our approach can be generalized to other types of non - adaptive random multi - access protocols ( e.g. , csma , carrier sense multiple access ) .",
    "we present this extension at the end of the paper .",
    "consider a communication system where @xmath0 users share a common resource in a distributed manner using the slotted - aloha protocol .",
    "specifically , time is slotted , and at the beginning of each slot , should a given user @xmath1 have a packet to transmit , it attempts to use the resource with probability @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 represent the vector of fixed transmission probabilities .",
    "when two users decide to transmit a packet simultaneously , a collision occurs and the packets of both users have to be retransmitted .",
    "each user is equipped with an infinite buffer , where it stores the packets in a fifo manner before there are successfully transmitted .",
    "packets arrive into user @xmath1 s buffer according to a stationary ergodic process of intensity @xmath2 .",
    "the arrival processes are independent across users , and are markov modulated .",
    "more precisely , the packet arrivals for user @xmath1 can be represented by an ergodic markov chain @xmath5 with stationary probability @xmath6 of being in state @xmath7 , and with transition kernel @xmath8 .",
    "the markov chains @xmath9 are independent across users and take values in a finite space @xmath10 .",
    "if at time slot @xmath11 @xmath12 , a new packet arrives into the buffer of user @xmath1 with probability @xmath13 , where the @xmath14 s are positive real numbers such that @xmath15 .",
    "the average arrival rate of packets per slot at user @xmath1 is then @xmath2 .",
    "we use these chains to represent various classes of packet inter - arrival times .",
    "the simplest example is that of bernoulli arrivals , i.e. , when the inter - arrivals are geometrically distributed with mean @xmath16 : this can be represented by the markov chain @xmath9 with one state .",
    "we could also represent inter - arrivals that are sums ( or random weighted sums ) of geometric random variables . in the following",
    "we denote by @xmath17 the proportion of traffic generated by user @xmath1 .",
    "denote by @xmath18 the number of packets in the buffer of user @xmath1 at the beginning of slot @xmath11 .",
    "the state of the system is given by @xmath19 at time slot @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath20 is a discrete - time markov chain .",
    "the stability region @xmath21 is defined as the set of vectors @xmath22 such that the system is stable , i.e. @xmath23 is ergodic , for packet arrival rates @xmath24 .",
    "it is important to remark that , a priori , @xmath21 depends on the transmission probabilities @xmath25 , but also on the types of arrival processes defined by the transition kernels @xmath26 and the parameters @xmath27 . but to keep the notation simple , we use @xmath21 to denote the stability region .      the problem of characterizing the stability region @xmath21 has received a lot of attention in the literature in the three last decades .",
    "first of all note that when the system is _ homogeneous _ in the sense that @xmath28 $ ] does not depend on @xmath1 , then one can show as in @xcite that the stability condition is : @xmath29 for all @xmath1 regardless of the nature of the arrival process ( in this very specific case , all buffers saturate simultaneously at the stability limit ) . for nonhomogeneous systems",
    "an exact characterization has been provided in @xcite under general traffic assumptions but only for @xmath30 users . for two users , the stability region @xmath31",
    "is defined by : @xmath32 if and only if : @xmath33 @xmath34 the first ( resp .",
    "second ) condition is obtained assuming that at the stability limit , buffer 2 ( resp .",
    "buffer 1 ) is saturated .",
    "when the number of users is greater than two , the stability region depends not only on the mean arrival rates @xmath2 , but also on the other detailed statistical properties of the arrival processes .",
    "for example , when @xmath35 , this is due to the fact that the stability condition for a particular buffer depends on the probability that the two other buffers are empty separately or simultaneously .",
    "these probabilities actually depend on the detailed characteristics of the arrival processes , see e.g. @xcite . for @xmath35 and bernoulli arrivals , the stability region",
    "can be characterized @xcite .",
    "when the arrivals are not bernoulli , the system stability region is unknown .",
    "when the number of users @xmath0 exceeds 3 , it becomes impossible to derive explicit stability conditions .",
    "for bernoulli arrivals , as was shown in @xcite , the stability region @xmath21 can be recursively described as a function of the various stability regions of systems with @xmath36 users , @xmath37 , and of the probabilities that in these systems , some buffers are simultaneously empty .",
    "these probabilities are unknown in general , and so is the stability region .",
    "the results of @xcite have been recently generalized to more general systems of interacting queues @xcite .",
    "the only previous explicit stability condition for arbitrary @xmath0 is given in @xcite ; unfortunately , to obtain this condition , the author has to assume that the arrival processes of the different users are correlated , which is unrealistic in practice .",
    "some other authors have proposed bounds on the stability region , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind most of the proposed bounds is to build systems that stochastically dominate ( or that are stochastically dominated by ) the initial system .",
    "for example , a system where one of the buffers is assumed to be always non - empty stochastically dominates the initial system , and hence has a smaller stability region . in @xcite",
    "the reader will find an interesting discussion on the existing techniques to derive bounds of the stability region .",
    "it is worth remarking that often in the literature , researchers have been interested in deriving what we refer to as the _ capacity region _ of aloha systems .",
    "it is defined as the set of vector @xmath24 such that there exists a vector @xmath25 of transmission probabilities such that the resulting system is stable . in this paper , we fix the transmission probabilities and investigate the stability region , i.e. the set of @xmath24 such that the system is stable . in particular , if we succeed in characterizing the stability region for any vector @xmath25 , then we may easily deduce the capacity region .",
    "the main contribution of this work is to propose a simple explicit approximate expression of the stability region @xmath21 .",
    "this approximate stability region @xmath38 enjoys the following properties :    * when the number @xmath0 of users grows large , the gap between @xmath38 and the actual stability region @xmath21 vanishes . * even for small systems , @xmath38 proves to be very accurate . for @xmath30 ,",
    "one actually has @xmath39 ; for @xmath35 and any other number of users , the approximate region is very accurate .",
    "in fact , for any values of @xmath0 , there exists an infinite number of points where the boundaries of @xmath21 and of @xmath38 coincide , which explains the accuracy .",
    "* @xmath38 is insensitive , i.e. , it depends on the arrival processes through their intensities @xmath2 s only .    to prove that @xmath38 becomes exact",
    "when @xmath0 grows large , we use a mean field analysis of the system , and we show that the stability of the finite system of queues and that of the mean field limiting regime are related ( in fact equivalent when @xmath0 grows large ) . to our knowledge , this is the first time mean field asymptotics are used to provide stability conditions of the finite systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the approximate stability region is proposed and the main result , i.e. the fact that @xmath38 tends to @xmath21 when @xmath0 is large , is stated in theorem 1 .",
    "in section iii , we present theoretical arguments and numerical experiments to illustrate the accuracy of @xmath38 .",
    "sections iv and v are devoted to the proof of theorem 1 : in section iv , we present a mean field analysis of the system , and in section v , we investigate the stability of the system in the limiting mean field regime , and explain why the stability condition obtained provides an ergodicity condition of the finite system of queues .",
    "we generalize our results to non - adaptive csma protocols in section vi , and conclude in section vii .",
    "we now provide an approximate expression of the stability region for a system with an arbitrary number of users .",
    "we prove that this approximation is exact when the number of users grows large .",
    "the approximate expression is valid for any arrival processes , which indicates that the stability region becomes insensitive when @xmath0 grows .    roughly speaking ,",
    "the approximate stability region is obtained assuming that the evolutions of the queues of the various users are independent .",
    "let @xmath40^n$ ] be the set of @xmath41 such that @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . the approximate stability region is the region lying below one of @xmath0 boundaries @xmath45 defined by : @xmath46^n , \\forall i,\\\\    & \\lambda_i=\\rho_i p_i\\prod_{k\\neq i}(1-\\rho_kp_k)\\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] more precisely , @xmath38 is the set of positive vectors @xmath24 such that there exist @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 for all @xmath1 .",
    "note that @xmath39 , so the proposed approximation is exact when @xmath30 .",
    "assume that the traffic distribution @xmath50 , is fixed and let us find the maximum total arrival rate @xmath51 such that @xmath52 belongs to the closure of @xmath38 .",
    "it can be easily shown that at this maximum , the user @xmath53 such that @xmath54 is @xmath55 . indeed , since for all @xmath1 , @xmath56 , then @xmath57 , and @xmath58 we deduce the maximum arrival rate : @xmath59      our main result states that the actual stability region @xmath21 is very close to the proposed approximation @xmath38 when @xmath0 is large .",
    "to formalize this , we introduce a sequence of systems indexed by @xmath0 , i.e. , the arrival rates are @xmath60 , the transmission probabilities are @xmath61 , and the markov chains modulating the arrival processes are @xmath62 .    in order for a system with @xmath0 users to give reasonable bandwidth to each user the duration of a time slot must be of order @xmath63 seconds , i.e. , we suppose @xmath64 seconds will represent @xmath65 time slots .",
    "we assume that users can be categorized among a finite set @xmath66 of @xmath67 classes .",
    "further we assume the proportion of users @xmath1 in class @xmath68 tends to @xmath69 when @xmath70 .",
    "the class of a user characterizes its transmission probability and the packet arrival process in its buffer .",
    "the transmission probability of user @xmath1 of class @xmath68 is @xmath71 .",
    "we assume that for all @xmath0 , @xmath72 .",
    "this assumption is made so as to keep the approximation expression of the stability region simple . in section",
    "v , we explain how to extend the assumption , and give ways to remove it .",
    "note that , as kleinrock already noticed @xcite , the assumption is needed to guarantee a certain efficiency of the system .    in order that the system not be overloaded , we assume that the mean packet arrival rate of user @xmath1 of class @xmath68 is @xmath73 .",
    "the class of a user also defines the markov chain modulating its arrival process .",
    "if user @xmath1 is of class @xmath68 , this markov chain @xmath74 is assumed to be in stationary regime with probability @xmath75 of being in state @xmath7 , in which case the probability that a packet arrives in its buffer is @xmath76 , where @xmath77 are positive real numbers such that @xmath78 .",
    "we assume that the markov chains @xmath79 are independent .",
    "denote by @xmath80 the transition kernel of @xmath74 .",
    "the markov chains @xmath74 may be fast or slow .",
    "in particular the arrival rate may change on the order of time slots if packets are generated by a http connection since the transmission rate is changed dynamically by http . on the other hand the state describing a voip connection would evolve on the scale of seconds as the speaker alternates between silent and speech periods . to represent these two scenarios ,",
    "we introduce @xmath81 continuous - time markov processes @xmath82 , @xmath83 , taking values in @xmath84 with jump rate kernel @xmath85 ( expressed in transitions per second ) , and we assume that the corresponding markov chains modulating the arrivals of the various users are as follows .    in this case , for all @xmath86 , the law of @xmath87 is equal to that of @xmath88 ( recall that @xmath64 seconds roughly represent @xmath89 slots ) . in other words ,",
    "the modulating markov chain changes state on the scale of time slots ; i.e. @xmath0 times faster than the speed at which the user evolves ( e.g. the speed at which the user attempts to transmit a packet ) . in this case @xmath90 .    in this case , for all @xmath86 , the law of @xmath87 is equal to that of @xmath91 ; i.e. the speed of the modulating markov chains is proportional to the speed of at which the user evolves . in this case",
    "@xmath92    we denote by @xmath21 the stability region of the system indexed by @xmath0 .",
    "as explained earlier , the stability region depends on the transmission probabilities and on the type of arrival processes .",
    "the following theorem compares the stability region @xmath21 with our proposed approximation @xmath93 as @xmath0 gets large .",
    "the theorem is valid for both types of sequences of systems , 1 and 2 .",
    "since @xmath38 does not depend on the kernels @xmath80 , the theorem indicates that when @xmath0 is large , the stability region depends on the arrival processes through the mean arrival rates only . define @xmath94 .",
    "[ th : stab1 ] for all @xmath95 small enough , there exists @xmath96 such that for all @xmath97 : + ( a ) if @xmath98 , then @xmath99 ; + ( b ) if @xmath100 , then @xmath101 .",
    "theorem [ th : stab1 ] is proven in sections iv and v. the main steps of the proof are as follows .",
    "+ ( 1 ) the evolution of the system when @xmath0 grows large is characterized : it is shown that with an appropriate scaling in time , the evolution of the distributions of the various queues is the solution of a deterministic dynamical system .",
    "this result is obtained using mean field asymptotic techniques , as presented in section iv.a .",
    "these techniques typically provide an approximate description of the evolution of the system over finite time horizons . here",
    "we wish to study the ergodicity of slotted - aloha systems , which basically relates to the system dynamics over an infinite horizon of time .",
    "hence , classical mean field asymptotic results will be necessary but not sufficient to prove theorem 1 .",
    "the main technical contribution of this paper is to explain how mean field asymptotics can be used to infer the ergodicity of the finite systems , and this is what is done in steps ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . + ( 2 ) we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for the global stability of the dynamical system describing the evolution of the system in the mean field regime .",
    "+ ( 3 ) finally , it is shown that the ergodicity of the initial system of @xmath0 queues is equivalent to the stability of the mean field dynamical system when @xmath0 grows large .",
    "a consequence of the above result is that when @xmath0 grows large , and whatever the arrival processes considered , the set traffic intensities @xmath24 such that there exist transmission probabilities @xmath25 stabilizing the system is the set @xmath102 with boundary @xmath103 : @xmath104 this result has been conjectured by tsybakov and mikhailov in @xcite .",
    "it has been proved in @xcite , but under the assumption that the arrival processes of the various users are correlated .",
    "the authors of @xcite have introduced the so - called _ sensitivity monotonicity _ conjecture under which they could also prove the result .",
    "theorem 1 says that when the number of users is large enough , the sensitivity monotonicity conjecture is not needed .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath102 coincides with the shannon capacity region of the multi - user collision channel derived in @xcite .",
    "theorem 1 shows that the capacity region and the shannon capacity region are equivalent when the number of users grows large . in @xcite",
    "the reader will find a more detailed discussion on the comparison of these two regions in communication systems .",
    "how far is the approximate region @xmath38 from the actual stability region ?",
    "theorem [ th : stab1 ] says that the gap tends to 0 when the number @xmath0 of users grows large .",
    "but even for small @xmath0 , @xmath38 is quite an accurate approximation as illustrated in the numerical examples provided later .",
    "why is the approximate region so accurate ?      this accuracy can be explained by remarking that the boundaries of the regions @xmath21 and @xmath38 coincide in many scenarios .",

    "+ first , we consider the case of @xmath35 sources , each transmitting with probability 1/3 .",
    "we vary the relative values of the arrival rates at the various queues : @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we vary @xmath123 from 1 to 50 .",
    "it can be shown that the approximate stability condition is @xmath124 in figure [ fig : comp ] ( left ) , we compare this limit to the actual stability limit found by simulation with bernoulli arrivals ( simulation 1 ) and hyper - geometric arrivals ( simulation 2 ) . in the latter case , the inter - arrivals for each user @xmath1 are i.i.d . , and an inter - arrival is a geometric random variable with parameter @xmath125 with probability 1/2 , and @xmath126 with probability 1/2 .",
    "this increases the variance of inter - arrivals ( when @xmath7 is small the variance scales as @xmath127 ) . in the numerical experiment",
    ", we chose @xmath128 .",
    "remark that the stability region is roughly insensitive to the distribution of inter - arrivals .",
    "this insensitivity has been also observed in the other examples presented in this section .",
    "the simulation results have been obtained running the system for about @xmath129 packet arrivals .",
    "note finally that the arrival rates are chosen so that the system is not @xmath105-homogeneous .",
    "we make a similar numerical experiment when @xmath130 are equal to 0.6 , 0.3 , 0.1 respectively .",
    "the arrival rates at the three queues are as in example 1 .",
    "we vary @xmath123 from 0.1 and 10 . for @xmath131 , at the boundary of @xmath132 , queue 3 is saturated ( @xmath133 ) ; whereas for @xmath134 , queue 2 is saturated ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "the approximate stability condition is : @xmath136 figure [ fig : comp ] ( center ) illustrates the accuracy of @xmath137 .",
    "finally , we illustrate the accuracy of @xmath38 when the number of users @xmath0 grows . each user is assumed to transmit with probability @xmath63 and",

    "again as expected , @xmath51 provides an excellent approximation of the saturation level in the actual system .",
    "the two next sections are devoted to the proof of theorem 1 . in section iv , we provide a classical mean field analysis of the system , and in section v , we show how the stability in the limiting mean field regime translates into the ergodicity of the initial finite systems .",

    "for example , in the case of slotted - aloha , it can be easily seen that when the channel is shared by @xmath0 users with similar characteristics , i.e. , same arrival rate @xmath480 and same transmission probability , then the maximum amount of traffic @xmath24 that the system can support is @xmath481 . with csma , this amount can be made arbitrarily close to 1 ( as we would obtain using a perfect centralized multi - access scheme ) just letting the channel holding time grow large .",
    "the model is similar than the one used for slotted - aloha , except that when a user attempts to use the channel , it keeps transmitting during @xmath108 consecutive slots . in the current ieee802.11 g standard @xcite , for data packets",

    "we just assume that all users transmit packets of the same sizes and at the same rate , for all @xmath1 , @xmath484 .",
    "another possible generalization is to allow the collision to be shorter than the packet successful transmissions .",
