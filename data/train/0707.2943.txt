    "to do so , it is necessary to choose a value for @xmath97 that is less than the free electron mass , extremely unrealistic for a transition metal alloy . with regards to @xmath96 , we chose @xmath126 as a representative value of @xmath96 for a metal . in order to obtain a value of @xmath111 to match the pcar value of , we would need @xmath127 , corresponding to an electron density of about @xmath128 , three orders of magnitude too high for a metal , and placing the fermi surface in the 4th brillouin zone .",
    "one would not expect that @xmath111 and @xmath129 should be the same in any case .",
    "it was pointed out by mazin @xcite that for a fairly transparent ballistic contact , the conductivity for given spin sub - band @xmath130 , whilst for ordinary diffusive transport the conductivity @xmath131 .",
    "it is on these parameters that the spin polarization depends:@xcite compare equation [ pball ] with equation [ pdiff ] .",
    "the ballistic current polarization is given by          which involves a spin - dependent relaxation time @xmath134 , besides the band structure parameters like the density of states @xmath135 and the square of the fermi velocity @xmath136 .",
    "our work could act as a stimulus for detailed band - structure calculations needed to average @xmath137 and @xmath138 over the whole fermi surface in order to make quantitative comparisons , but we would like to note that the scattering rate @xmath139 is seen to be the decisive parameter here .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect that @xmath140 in a ferromagnet such as this , where scattering from defects and impurities occurs at different rates for carriers of different spin.@xcite our parameters for scattering within the fept metal are within the range of those reported for various impurities introduced as scattering centres into a 3d magnetic matrix .",
    "@xcite moreover , the parameter @xmath26 that appears in drift - diffusion models of the current perpendicular to plane giant magnetoresistance plays the role of the spin - polarization of the diffusive conductivity within the bulk of a magnetic layer .",
    "values for @xmath26 of up to 0.9 have been found for some commonplace 3d ferromagnetic alloys.@xcite we therefore explain the much higher values of @xmath141 as compared to @xmath142 as arising from the asymmetry in the scattering rates for spin - up and spin - down for scattering from vacancies , impurities , and anti - site defects in the l1@xmath0 structure , which lead to additional polarization in the diffusive current over and above that from the band structure alone .",
    "meanwhile only the electronic structure affects the polarization obtained from the pcar method .",
    "it is worth noting that even an unpolarized electron gas can carry a diffusive current of finite spin - polarization in the presence of spin - dependent relaxation times .",
    "hence an appropriate ratio of spin - dependent scattering rates can considerably amplify ( or , in unfavorable circumstances , attenuate ) an intrinsic spin - polarization in terms of number density when a current starts to flow .",
    "+ this is significant , since it is @xmath141 that is the relevant parameter entering into theories of current driven wall motion@xcite indeed it was in this context that berger suggested , almost thirty years ago , that a measurement of the pressure exerted on a wall in ferromagnet could be used to determine current polarisation@xcite .",
    "we expect that the results of this measurement of @xmath141 should be in accord with that measured by domain wall resistance .",
    "however , due to the dearth of experimental data for diffusive values , when experimental data are interpreted in terms of these theories , lower value of polarization determined from a non - diffusive transport regime such as pcar is often the only available one to use@xcite .",
    "however , we can see from the results in this article that these values significantly underestimate the real degree of spin - polarization , and hence the rate at which spin angular momentum is transferred to a domain wall .",
    "we also anticipate that the diffusive current polarization in more technologically relevant materials such as permalloy might be measured by making suitable nanostructures that exploit geometrical confinement to form narrow domain walls@xcite in order to yield a sufficiently large domain wall resistance to be easily measured .",
