    "in the near future , clusters of galaxies will prove to be an increasingly important probe into the abundance and properties of both dark matter and dark energy .",
    "data on large numbers of clusters are becoming available from surveys at many wavelengths : in the optical / infrared , from galaxy overdensities @xcite or from weak gravitational lensing of background objects @xcite ; in the x - ray @xcite ; and in the microwave , by locating temperature decrements caused by the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite .",
    "properly interpreting such surveys will require a sound understanding of the state of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",

    "this procedure has advantages over performing full hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "because less computational expense is required , large volumes can be simulated . also , one can vary parameters , such as the amount of star formation and feedback , without having to redo an entire simulation .",

    "also did not allow for transfers of energy from the dark matter to the gas .",
    "it is evident from simulations that this does occur , so we allow for this transfer here . because of these limitations , required a large amount of feedback energy to match x - ray observations .",

    "to create a mock catalog , cluster - sized halos are extracted from a dark matter only n - body simulation , and then the gas distribution inside each halo potential is determined .",
    "this section describes the gas model and the construction of the halo catalog which is used .",
    "a given dm halo is enclosed in a cubic mesh , using a cell size , @xmath9 , twice the n - body particle spline softening length .",
    "the dm density , @xmath10 , and gravitational potential , @xmath11 , are computed for each cell @xmath12 using a particle - mesh code with non - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the cell with the lowest potential , @xmath13 , is considered the center of the cluster .",
    "particle velocities in the rest frame of the cluster ( defined as the mean velocity of the 125 particles closest to the cluster center ) are used to find the ke per unit volume , @xmath14 , in each cell . the virial radius ( from spherical top - hat collapse ;",
    "* ) can then be computed , as well as the halo virial mass , @xmath15 , and energy , @xmath16 .",
    "it is assumed that gas originally followed the dm inside the virial radius , with density @xmath17 and ke @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "a certain amount of the gas , @xmath20 , will have turned into stars .",
    "we parameterize this mass by the fraction @xmath21 at z=0 ; the evolution of @xmath22 with redshift is described in appendix [ sec : starform ] .",
    "this stellar mass presumably formed from the portion of the gas with the lowest entropy and shortest cooling time , so cells are ranked by binding energy and then are checked off , starting with the most bound , until the sum of their gas masses equals @xmath20 ; the gas mass and energy in these cells are set to zero .",
    "thus the initial mass @xmath23 and energy @xmath24 of the remaining gas are : @xmath25 @xmath26 summing over all cells inside @xmath27 except those marked off for star formation .",

    "these additional energy inputs will be described in sec .",
    "[ sec : feedback ] . finally , requiring the final surface pressure to match the external pressure yields the second constraint @xmath44 summing over the @xmath45 bins in the radial range @xmath46 .",

    "the gas prescription was applied to clusters selected from a large - scale n - body simulation .",
    "we will refer the reader to and @xcite for further details , as the numerical methods used to carry out this simulation are the same as described in those papers .",
    "the cosmological parameters were chosen to be ( @xmath47 ) = ( 0.044 , 0.264 , 0.736 , 0.71 , 0.96 , 0.80 ) , consistent with the wmap 5-year results @xcite .",
    "the simulation volume is @xmath48mpc on a side and contains n=@xmath49 particles , making the particle mass @xmath50 ; the particle spline softening length is @xmath51kpc . at each simulation step particles",
    "were saved in one octant of a thin spherical shell centered on the origin , thus building up the matter distribution in a past light cone covering one eighth of the sky .",
    "all halos with a friends - of - friends mass of at least @xmath52 ( 293 particles ) were selected from this light cone , out to redshift @xmath53 .",
    "masses and radii at the virial and other overdensities are computed , in particular @xmath1 and @xmath54 at a mean overdensity of 500 times critical .",
    "the amount of star formation and iron production is determined based on the cluster redshift , as described in appendix [ sec : starform ] .",
    "the gas prescription was then run on each halo ; there are over 15,000 halos in this catalog with @xmath55 . to test",
    "that resolution is sufficient , a smaller sample of halos was selected from a higher resolution simulation .",
    "this has the same cosmological parameters , but the volume is @xmath56mpc on a side , and the softening length is @xmath57kpc ; thus mass resolution is increased by a factor of 30.5 , and spatial resolution by a factor of 5 .",
    "no significant difference was seen when comparing results for lower mass halos ( @xmath58 ) at the two resolutions ; halos more massive than this are difficult to deal with at the higher resolution because of the large grid required .",
    "once the density , temperature , and metallicity in each cell are known , the x - ray luminosity in the 0.52 kev band is computed with the mekal model @xcite . for the cluster temperature ,",
    "the mixt code of @xcite was used to compute the spectroscopic temperature @xmath59 in the projected annulus @xmath60r_{500}$ ] ; this is the definition of cluster temperature used throughout this paper .",
    "there are a number of parameters which must be specified : @xmath61 , and @xmath37 .",
    "we will calibrate the model by comparing to x - ray data , in particular by matching the gas fraction as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "two subsamples from are selected from the halo catalog to match the properties of the two data sets we use for the calibration ( this data is shown as a function of @xmath1 in figs .  [",
    "fig : sfeffect ] and [ fig : fbeffect ] ) .",
    "the first data set is from @xcite , which consists mostly of higher @xmath59 clusters ; so , for comparison , we select all halos with @xmath62 in the @xmath63 light cone",
    ". there are 76 halos in this subsample , with temperatures above 4 kev for most parameter choices .",

    "the second observational set is of low redshift groups ( @xmath66kev ) from @xcite ; so , for the second subsample , we select all model halos with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this subsample also contains 76 halos , most with @xmath69kev . a @xmath70",
    "is computed from this sample in an analogous manner as above . when searching for a best fit model we will minimize @xmath71 ; the factor of 0.5 ensures that the two terms contribute roughly equally near the minimum value .",
    "it is instructive to first consider the case of no star formation or energy input , i.e. @xmath72 ; we will refer to this as the `` zero '' model .",
    "the resulting temperature and @xmath73 are shown as a function of mass as dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : defmod ] . @xcite found the @xmath74 relation is well fit by a power law , @xmath75 , with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "[ fig : sfeffect ] shows the fractional difference @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the value obtained by plugging @xmath1 into the observed relation .",
    "this figure shows that at a given @xmath1 , the predicted temperature from this simple model is lower than observed , by over 10% . at the same time",
    ", it shows that the predicted gas fraction remains near the cosmic mean , and is independent of mass ( quite different from what is observed ) .",
    "this results in a @xmath80 which is too high ( by @xmath81 at higher masses ) and an @xmath82 relation with a slope near the self - similar value @xmath83 , slightly shallower than observed .",
    "thus we see the simplest set of assumptions yields an incorrect gas energy .",
    "there are three main processes which can alter this energy : transfer of energy from the dm through gravitational interactions , star formation , and feedback from astrophysical sources . in this section",
    "we will consider each of these in turn .",
    "so far ( as in ) , it has been assumed that the gas originally had the same specific energy as the dm .",
    "however , this ignores an important process during cluster formation : when mergers occur , energy is transferred from the dm to the gas .",
    "in fact , the dm can lose up to 10% of its energy in an equal mass collision , and even a 10:1 merger can reduce the dm energy by a couple of percent @xcite .",
    "simulations show such mergers are common : @xcite calculate that a typical cluster will experience four 5:1 accretion events since @xmath84 , and @xcite find that the mean rate for 10:1 or larger mergers in clusters is roughly two per halo per unit redshift .",
    "the magnitude of this effect can be estimated from hydrodynamical simulations , where it has long been found that baryon fraction in clusters is lower than the universal value ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "for simulations with no star formation or radiative processes , @xcite find that the average baryon fraction within @xmath85 is 90% of the cosmic mean at @xmath86=0 .",
    "this result is independent of cluster mass , and at @xmath86=1 the typical fraction is only 2 or 3% higher . without star formation and energy feedback , the method of sec .",
    "[ sec : gasp ] gives a mean @xmath87 for halos with @xmath88 ( at low redshift , @xmath89 ) . instead assuming that the energy transferred to the gas is 5% of the dm energy , i.e. using @xmath90 in eqn .",
    "[ eqn:3dfe ] , this fraction is reduced to @xmath91 . as we are using a lower @xmath92 than @xcite",
    ", a slightly higher gas fraction at @xmath93 seems appropriate .",
    "thus we adopt @xmath94% for the rest of the paper .",
    "[ fig : sfeffect ] , and also fig .",
    "[ fig : fbeffect ] , display the change in @xmath95 inside @xmath54 after including this added energy , as short - dashed lines . while lower than before , it is still higher than observed , and still roughly independent of mass .",
    "the temperature at a given mass increases , but only slightly , so the @xmath96 relation is still too high and shallow . including a term proportional to @xmath16 in this fashion does not change the self - similar nature of the model .    star formation will obviously decrease the gas fraction , but it has a second effect as well : since it is the most bound , lowest entropy gas that is turned into stars , the remaining gas will have a higher specific energy than before @xcite .",
    "the simplest assumption is to make the efficiency of star formation independent of cluster mass ; fig .",
    "[ fig : fbeffect ] shows , as dot - dashed lines , a @xmath90 model after also setting @xmath97=9% for all halo masses .",
    "the predicted gas fraction drops further for massive halos , near the observed value .",
    "note the change in @xmath95 is more than 9% ; the higher specific energy of the remaining gas is a significant effect , causing that gas to expand and further reducing the gas fraction in the inner parts of the halo . temperatures also increase , so at higher masses the predicted @xmath98 values are close to those observed .",
    "however , as the method up to this point has been scale - free , the gas fraction still does not depend on mass ; thus , for less massive clusters , the predicted @xmath95 and @xmath98 are still too large , since the slope is still the self - similar value .",
    "there are two ways to change the scale - free nature of the models : vary star formation efficiency with halo mass , or include feedback energy proportional to stellar mass .",
    "there is observational support for both options .",
    "@xcite , with a sample of 27 clusters , measured the fraction of stellar mass to be larger for lower mass clusters , following @xmath99 with @xmath100 . to apply this to our model",
    ", we will assume this relation also holds inside the virial radius , i.e. @xmath101 at @xmath93 . a model varying @xmath97 with mass in this manner is shown in fig .  [ fig : sfeffect ] as dot - dashed lines .",
    "as one would expect , this decreases the gas fraction more in lower mass halos ; it also changes the slope of the @xmath74 relation slightly .",
    "the slopes of the @xmath74 and @xmath96 relations will clearly depend on how strongly @xmath22 varies with halo mass .",
    "recently @xcite found a much steeper relation in a sample of 23 clusters : @xmath102 .",
    "a model where @xmath97 follows this relation is shown as long - dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfeffect ] .",
    "the effect is quite dramatic in low mass clusters because so much gas is converted into stars ( @xmath103 or more ) , and the resulting @xmath59 and gas fractions tend to overshoot the observed trends at low masses . if we start with the @xcite and vary the slope , searching for a best - fit model as described in sec .  [ sec : makeclust ]",
    ", we find an exponent of @xmath104 yields a cluster sample with @xmath74 and @xmath96 relations quite close to those observed ; this model is shown as solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfeffect ] .",
    "we will refer to this choice of parameters ( @xmath105 ) as our `` sf - only '' model .",
    "the second effect which can break the scale - free nature of the models is additional energy injection , e.g. from sne or agn .",
    "we will assume such feedback is proportional to the number of stars formed , @xmath2 ( see appendix [ sec : starform ] ) .",
    "as an estimate of the amount of energy under consideration , for @xmath97=9% and feedback energy @xmath106 , the energy added amounts to 0.8 kev per particle initially inside @xmath27 .",
    "core collapse sne could only add 0.4 kev / particle ( assuming the model in appendix [ sec : starform ] and @xmath107 erg per event ) , so in this case there must be some additional source such as agn energy from accreting black holes . if the mass in black holes is @xmath108 , and 2% of the rest mass energy of the accreted material is converted into thermal energy @xcite , then an additional 1.0 kev / particle could be added to the gas .",
    "[ fig : fbeffect ] shows the effect of adding feedback , starting with @xmath90 and @xmath109 .",
    "the long - dashed lines are for an extreme model with @xmath110 . for the most massive halos ,",
    "the feedback energy is not significant compared to the binding energy of the cluster ; hence there is little change evident . for less massive clusters ,",
    "the added energy is enough to cause the gas to expand , lowering the gas fraction considerably .",
    "the @xmath74 relation becomes less steep as well , as lower mass halos become hotter ; the @xmath96 relation is thus less steep also , though in this example the change is so large as to be incompatible with observations .    varying the amount of feedback , the best - fit search yields a more moderate level of @xmath3 , shown as solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fbeffect ] .",
    "we will call this ( @xmath111 ) the `` feedback '' model . like the sf - only model",
    ", this reproduces quite well the observed @xmath74 and @xmath96 relations .",
    "the efficiency @xmath112 is smaller than the equivalent number used in for several reasons .",
    "part of the difference is merely bookkeeping : did not consider mass loss from stars , and expressed feedback as being proportional to @xmath22 , while here we instead use the larger mass @xmath2 .",
    "more substantially , did not include the @xmath113 term , instead effectively considering it as part of the feedback . finally , here",
    "the gas surface pressure is calculated over a smaller radial buffer zone than in , which leads to a slightly lower gas fraction initially .",
    "[ fig : sfeffect ] and [ fig : fbeffect ] show that there is a degeneracy between steepening the star formation efficiency as a function of halo mass and increasing the amount of feedback per unit stellar mass .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : eaplane ] . we have found two models which both reproduce the x - ray data reasonably well : the sf - only model , which varies star formation efficiency as @xmath114 ( steeper than the values found by @xcite or @xcite , but less steep than @xcite ) , and the feedback model , which instead has constant @xmath109 and adds feedback @xmath3 .",
    "a third option is of course some combination of these two .",
    "since a stellar mass fraction independent of mass does appear to be contradicted by observations , we will adopt the star formation efficiency as given by @xcite and vary @xmath115 to find the best - fit model .",
    "this results in a lower level of feedback , @xmath116 .",
    "we will call this our `` standard '' model ( @xmath117 ) , which we will use for the rest of the paper . fig .  [",
    "fig : defmod ] shows the @xmath74 and @xmath96 relations for this third model .",
    "this choice of parameters yields a population with thermal energy as a function of mass quite close to that seen by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , keep in mind that there will be a range of models around this one which will fit the x - ray data equally well it would be difficult to distinguish between these three models based solely on the gas profiles .",
    "the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : eaplane ] gives a rough idea of the acceptable range of @xmath118 and @xmath115 .",
    "there is one further physical effect to be considered , namely nonthermal pressure support , e.g. from cosmic rays or magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we will conclude this section by considering how a moderate level of nonthermal support affects our model .",
    "if in fact @xmath119 , then the @xmath1 derived from x - rays are too low , because they are derived by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "[ fig : dreleffect ] shows our standard model , after adjusting masses in the observational points by 10% to account for this ; in this situation the model now has too high @xmath59 and @xmath95 at a given @xmath1 .",
    "adding @xmath119 to this model means that the gas requires less thermal pressure to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium , so the solution to eqns .",
    "[ eqn:3dfe ] and [ eqn:3dfp ] yields gas which is cooler and correspondingly denser .",
    "this is shown as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : dreleffect ] ; the model is now too cold , and the gas fraction even higher . comparing to fig .",
    "[ fig : sfeffect ] , it can be seen that increasing @xmath37 has the opposite effects of increasing @xmath120 .",
    "if we take the @xmath119 model and allow the dynamical energy input to vary , the best - fit result has @xmath121 , shown as solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : dreleffect ] .",
    "this puts our predicted clusters back into agreement with the ( adjusted ) observations , at the same level as the standard model .",
    "we will call this set of parameters ( @xmath122 ) the `` @xmath123 '' model .",
    "increasing @xmath120 in this way assumes that non - radiative hydrodynamic simulations are missing some processes which transfer energy to gas during cluster formation .",
    "this certainly could be the case .",
    "for example , the dynamical friction experienced by the stars assembling into a cd galaxy would add significant amounts of energy to the icm @xcite .",
    "having fixed on a standard model , in this section we will examine how well it matches observations at other radii than @xmath54 .    given that our dm halos have the standard density profile , the @xmath124 relation of our model should also agree with observations .",
    "fitting all halos with @xmath125kev , the best fit power law relation gives a normalization of @xmath126 at @xmath127=5kev .",
    "this agrees well with observed x - ray samples , using masses derived from either weak lensing @xcite or x - rays @xcite .",
    "the standard model also has an x - ray luminosity in good agreement with the observations of @xcite , unlike the zero model which is a factor of 2 - 3 more luminous .",
    "this is hardly surprising , since we calibrated the model in part on this data . above @xmath128 , the predicted @xmath129 , but below this",
    "the relation is much steeper , approaching @xmath130 .",
    "@xcite find the observed scatter at a given mass is @xmath131 , while the model scatter is roughly half of this .",
    "there are many processes occurring in the cores of clusters which could significantly alter @xmath73 not included in our model , which would increase the scatter and somewhat alter the mass dependence .",
    "a fundamental property of the gas is its entropy , usually defined in cluster studies as @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the electron number density .",
    "based on chandra observations of nearby relaxed clusters , @xcite determined how entropy varies with cluster temperature at several characteristic radii , including @xmath54 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",

    "also shown as a dotted line is the zero model . the effect of increasing the gas energy is to cause gas to expand and reduce the gas mass ; however , this does not change the integrated pressure profile much , since the gas in the center must still hold up all the gas above it .",
    "this effect is larger for smaller mass halos , making the @xmath146 relation less steep .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : feedback ] we found several different models which , given the degeneracy among input parameters , gave similar results . since one goal of this is to provide a means of predicting the sz signal from clusters , it is useful to compare these models .",

    "this highlights the importance of normalizing to x - ray data when modeling the sz signal .",
    "in this paper we have described an improved method for calculating the gas distribution in a dm potential well , constraining the model to match the observed x - ray gas fractions ; then we made further comparisons with x - ray and sz observations in order to check , where possible , our conclusions .",
    "extracting the greatest return from upcoming cluster surveys will require understanding the state of the intracluster gas .",
    "it is encouraging that the simple model presented here can so well reproduce observed profiles and trends with cluster mass . with this model",
    "the following main points have demonstrated : + @xmath148 simulations show that during mergers the energy of the dm component will be tapped to provide shock heating to the gas . transferring @xmath149% of the binding energy of the dm to the gas results in gas fractions at large radii which are in good agreement with non - radiative hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "+ @xmath148 breaking the scale - free nature of the model to bring it into accord with observed scalings requires either varying the efficiency of star formation with cluster mass or increasing the specific energy of the gas by an amount that is not proportional to the cluster binding energy ( e.g. by being proportional to the stellar mass ) , or both . + @xmath148 without including feedback energy , varying the efficiency of star formation as @xmath114 reproduces observed @xmath74 and @xmath96 relations .",
    "this is steeper than found by @xcite and @xcite , but less steep than found by @xcite .",
    "a relation as steep as @xmath150 , as seen by the latter , would leave too small gas fractions ( and that gas at too high temperatures ) in less massive clusters ; however , the difference is less than two sigma .",
    "also , keep in mind that what is measured is the stellar fraction inside @xmath54 , whereas @xmath97 in our model is the fraction inside @xmath27 ; the two need not be identical .",
    "we are assuming that stars have the same radial distribution as dm , but if stars are instead more centrally located , this would change our predicted relation . @xcite selected for clusters with a dominant central galaxy , and for the least massive clusters @xmath54 is in the outskirts of this galaxy . because a central dominant galaxy takes up a larger fraction of the stellar mass in smaller clusters , one could argue that the stellar fraction inside @xmath54 changes more rapidly with cluster mass than does the fraction inside @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath151 should vary with halo mass at a larger rate than @xmath97 . + @xmath148 a model with @xmath152 independent of cluster mass but including feedback energy proportional to the mass of formed stars can also reproduce the observed @xmath74 and @xmath96 .",
    "however , this requires adding roughly one kev per particle initially inside @xmath27 .",
    "this might be possible if the output from accreting black holes is converted to thermal energy with high enough efficiency ( @xmath153 ) .",

    "* ) and including a lower feedback level of @xmath6 also yields the proper scalings . assuming the mass in black holes is @xmath108 , this energy is @xmath155 of their rest mass ( or 0.33 kev per particle ; note this does not take into account the feedback supplied by supernovae ) .",
    "this model was compared to further observations in sec .",
    "[ sec : compother ] , but the other two possibilities discussed here behave in quite a similar fashion .",
    "+ @xmath148 including nonthermal pressure results in a cooler , denser gas distribution . to bring such a model back into agreement with x - ray observations",

    "once this is done , the pressure or entropy for a given @xmath59 is quite similar to models with @xmath156 , although of course the @xmath74 relation is different .",
    "a couple caveats are in order .",
    "we start with halos drawn from a dm - only simulation ; adding baryons to such a simulation may change the properties of the halo population @xcite .",
    "also , we have neglected many pertinent physical processes , such as cooling in the core ( note our definition of cluster temperature excludes the core ) .",
    "because of this , the model halo population likely has too low a scatter at a given mass .",
    "this is exacerbated by the tight relation we assume between halo mass and star formation plus feedback .",
    "for example , if we allowed for a variation in @xmath97 at a given halo mass , clusters with higher @xmath22 would have higher temperatures and lower gas fractions , and thus lower x - ray luminosities .",
    "this would explain why catalogs of optically selected clusters tend to be underluminous in x - rays at the same mass @xcite .",
    "for most halos in our standard model , the gas initially assumed to be inside @xmath27 has expanded outwards . for hotter ( @xmath157kev ) clusters only , the mean final radius @xmath41 is @xmath158 ( one sigma ) ; for all clusters the mean @xmath41 is @xmath159 .",
    "a result of this is that for the most massive clusters the baryon fraction inside @xmath27 is roughly 90% of the cosmic mean , @xmath19 .",

    ", however , the baryon fraction inside @xmath54 tops out near @xmath160 at the highest cluster masses .",
