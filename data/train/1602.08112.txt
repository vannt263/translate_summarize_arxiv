    "the kitaev quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) is an exotic state of matter that exhibits fractionalized excitations in the form of majorana fermions , and a realization of this physics has potential applications in the field of quantum information @xcite .",
    "the state can be realized by considering a honeycomb lattice of @xmath10=1/2 moments with either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic bond directional ising interactions , also referred to as kitaev interactions .",
    "the necessary terms in an effective spin hamiltonian can be realized in practice by octahedrally coordinated low - spin @xmath11 magnetic ions with strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "it is highly desirable to investigate the magnetic structure and excitations of these materials using neutron scattering techniques .",
    "much attention has been paid to iridates containing honeycomb lattices with ir@xmath12 ions @xcite as candidate materials for kitaev physics .",
    "the challenges presented by the large neutron absorption cross - section and rapid decrease of the ir magnetic form factor have limited the neutron studies of honeycomb iridates to date @xcite . on the other hand , it is much more feasible to carry out detailed neutron scattering investigations of the binary halide @xmath0-rucl@xmath1 , which has been proposed as an alternate candidate to realize kitaev physics@xcite . in this material ,",
    "honeycomb layers of octahedrally coordinated low spin ru@xmath9 ions are coupled via weak van der waals inter - layer interactions @xcite ( see fig",
    "the single ion ground state is confirmed as effective @xmath13=1/2 @xcite and interestingly both inelastic neutron scattering @xcite and raman scattering @xcite show evidence for continuum magnetic response that could be associated with fractionalized excitations .",
    "neutron diffraction studies @xcite have shown that the materials order in - plane with a zigzag spin structure which can arise from the kitaev - heisenberg model @xcite as well as kitaev - dominated models with additional more complicated interactions@xcite .",
    "in the course of investigations of @xmath0-rucl@xmath1 , it has become clear that sample - dependent issues have led to some confusion .    with hexagonal or honeycomb layers that are weakly coupled ,",
    "it is extremely easy for the system to form stacking faults @xcite , and in fact various polytypes characterized by different stacking sequences @xcite have nearly the same energy .",
    "this may be responsible for the fact that different crystal structures have been reported , including both the trigonal ( t ) space group @xmath14 where each unit cell contains three honeycomb layers@xcite , and the one layer per unit cell monoclinic ( m ) space group @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the low temperature magnetic ordering transitions have similarly shown some discrepancies .",
    "specific heat and susceptibility measurements on powders @xcite have consistently shown a broad nel transition at 14  k , however many previously investigated single - crystals show evidence for two separate nel transitions at @xmath15 = 8  k and 14  k , and perhaps others @xcite , with some suggestions that these are associated with exotic physics @xcite . a previous neutron diffraction study of single crystals with stacking faults indicated by a broad mosaicity in the direction perpendicular to the honeycomb planes @xcite showed ( using t nomenclature ) that the 14  k transition is associated with a ( 1/2 , 0 , 3/2)@xmath16 ordering wave vector corresponding to a bilayer abab antiferromagnetic stacking , while the 8  k transition is associated with a ( 1/2 , 0 , 1)@xmath16 wave vector indicating abc periodicity ( see the transformation matrix in the note @xcite ) . from here on we adopt the @xmath2 symmetry convention , and henceforth reflections mentioned in this paper are indexed in the monoclinic lattice except for those with the label  t  .",
    "these structures coexist in physically separated domains in the material in different proportions in different crystals .",
    "as mentioned above , stacking faults are ubiquitous in these layered materials and in diffraction patterns show up as diffuse rods .",
    "the dependence of the magnetic wave vectors on the stacking sequence greatly complicates the solution of the crystal and magnetic structures . a recent report of structural and magnetic results on crystals",
    "that were untwinned but exhibited significant stacking faults found that the materials were monoclinic and apparently exhibited a single , broad magnetic transition near 14  k @xcite .",
    "given that the magnetic properties can be dependent on the stacking sequence , it is crucial to study and refine the structures on single crystals of @xmath0-rucl@xmath1 with minimal stacking faults .",
    "here we report the results of studies of such crystals .",
    "x - ray refinements of the low temperature structure yield a monoclinic @xmath17 space group with a symmetrical in - plane honeycomb lattice . consistently , bulk characterization shows that the as - grown crystals exhibit a single well - defined and sharp magnetic transition at 7  k , with no signature of order apparent at 14  k. mechanically deforming the crystals induces a magnetic transition at 14  k and the crystals subject to repeated deformations eventually exhibit only one broad transition at 14  k. the 14  k transition with its observed two - layer periodicity is likely associated with a high density of stacking faults .",
    "neutron diffraction on a large high - quality single crystal conforms to the same monoclinic structure and only one transition at 7  k corresponding to an in - plane zigzag structure with 3-layer periodic magnetic ground state .",
    "the ordered moment is found to be small with the spin direction confined to the @xmath5-plane .",
    "two symmetry - allowed magnetic models have been found to be consistent with the observed data : one is collinear and the other exhibits an out - of - plane spiral . the best overall refinement has been obtained with the collinear model and leads to moment directions pointing 35@xmath6 away from the @xmath7-axis .",

    "it is natural to consider whether this could lead to a magnetic structure with an incommensurate modulation along the @xmath28 axis , resulting in satellite reflections around the magnetic bragg peaks . in the present experiment",
    "no such peaks were detected .",
    "if such peaks exist they may be extremely weak , or the periodicity of the incommensurate modulation may be too long ( exceeding 200 layers ) to be detected in the current measurement .",
    "the existing data can be explained by a purely commensurate magnetic structure .",
    "the @xmath2 , @xmath68 , @xmath14 , and more generally @xmath69 type space groups have similar in - plane arrangements of atoms but varying out - of - plane stacking sequences .",
    "these polytypes have similar configuration energies , with energy differences of the order of 1 mev per formula unit @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the well - known tendency for @xmath0-rucl@xmath1 to exhibit stacking faults@xcite .",
    "it is also natural to expect that the final space group manifested can depend on the starting material purity and conditions adopted for the crystal growth . with the synthesis procedures used in the present study we have found a tendency for smaller crystals to show @xmath2 symmetry at all temperatures , while some larger crystals form in a room temperature @xmath69 type trigonal space group .",
    "these room temperature trigonal crystals typically show a first order phase transition at 155  k , resulting in a low temperature @xmath2 structure .",
    "further systematic investigations are ongoing to elucidate the details of this behavior .",
    "preliminary refinements show that the in - plane structure and the local environment of the ru@xmath9 ions remain largely unmodified .",
    "this suggests that the thermal history during the material growth and handling is important , and explains why various groups have identified different space groups for this material @xcite . on the other hand , the low - temperature structure , which determines the magnetic ground state ,",
    "has always been robustly @xmath2 in all of our crystals .    the three - dimensional magnetic ordered structure reported in various specimens of @xmath0-rucl@xmath1 consists of stacked",
    "zig - zag ordered layers with a periodicity that is strongly dependent on the details of the samples .",
    "observations to date show that powders@xcite and crystals with significant diffuse scattering from stacking faults@xcite show a broad transition near 14  k with alternating layers coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "the crystals reported in this study show a single sharp transition at 7  k with a three layer periodicity .",
    "the origin of this difference may be related to frustration of the inter - plane interactions as discussed below .",
    "previous studies of bulk properties such as the susceptibility have led to the suggestion that the inter - plane magnetic interactions are antiferromagnetic@xcite .",
    "these interactions are naturally satisfied if the predominant stacking sequence is dominated by repeated monolayer or bilayer sequences , which certainly will be the case if stacking faults are plentiful as may be expected , for example , in powders , where the stacking sequence could be nearly random .",
    "the crystals measured in the present study exhibit a pseudo three layer stacking sequence with minimal stacking faults . diffraction alone can not determine the phase angle @xmath57 characterizing the exact modulation in the best fit collinear structure . to gain insight",
    "we consider the simple cases obtained for special values of @xmath57 when two - thirds of the layers have the same magnitude of moment .",
    "these special cases can be more generally represented by @xmath70=@xmath60@xmath71/6 ( @xmath71 is an integer ) with even and odd @xmath71 , respectively . for even @xmath71 ( e.g. @xmath57=0 )",
    ", the three consecutive planes have moments ( + 0.52 , 0 , -0.52 ) ( fig 5b ) .",
    "when @xmath71 is odd the same moments are ( -0.3 , 0.6 , -0.3 ) .",
    "the latter structure , with back to back ferromagnetically stacked planes , will have a higher energy if indeed the inter - planar interactions are predominantly antiferromagnetic .",
    "the solution with two antiferromagnetically aligned planes and one disordered makes sense physically if one considers that the pseudo - three layer crystal structure has a tendency to frustrate the antiferromagnetic interactions and this is the solution that relieves the frustration with minimal energy cost .",
    "this possibility remains to be tested in future measurements sensitive to local moments , for example muon spin rotation , which might distinguish the various possible scenarios .",
    "the refinement of the collinear structure shows that for any value of @xmath57 the best fit for the spin direction points approximately 35@xmath6 away from the @xmath39 plane ( 55@xmath6 away from @xmath24 ) .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite , for edge sharing octahedra the spin co - ordinate basis vectors make an angle of @xmath72(@xmath73)= @xmath3835.26@xmath6 to the @xmath39 plane .",
    "the two directions are not physically equivalent in the monoclinic structure , but the presence of monoclinic domains makes it impossible to distinguish between them in the present experiment . with the conventions used in the paper , the choice of tilt angle @xmath56 = -35@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "5c ) corresponds to the moment direction pointing along a ru - cl bond direction .",
    "this is precisely what would be expected for a leading order antiferromagnetic kitaev interaction with a ferromagnetic heisenberg term@xcite , and , significantly , is in agreement with the conclusions derived from inelastic neutron scattering@xcite .",
    "the solution with @xmath56=+35@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "5b ) would be close to the situation found in na@xmath18iro@xmath1 , where the moments were found to point 44.3@xmath6 out of the @xmath39 plane@xcite .",
    "future experiments on large untwinned single crystals of rucl@xmath1 might provide a definitive experimental determination of the sign of @xmath56 , but the overall physical picture suggests that the moments point along the ru - cl ligand .    as discussed by johnson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in the @xmath2 structure one of the three ru@xmath9-ru@xmath9 distances in the honeycomb lattice is inequivalent to the others .",
    "this small distortion may relieve some frustration and contribute to the formation of the low temperature zigzag magnetic order with a small ordered moment .",
    "our refinements show that the magnitude of this distortion is less than 0.2% . as noted previously@xcite this can result in an anisotropic kitaev term , equivalent to an additional uniaxial ising term , in the effective spin hamiltonian .",
    "this is one of several possible terms that can result in a spin gap within a classical spin wave model of magnetic excitations , although such a gap is also expected to arise from quantum fluctuations which will be strong in @xmath0-rucl@xmath1 .",
    "we believe it is premature to fully attribute this gap to bond anisotropy as suggested in reference@xcite .    in a pure kitaev model magnetic order",
    "is absent and the t=0 ground state is a qsl . in @xmath0-rucl@xmath1 ,",
    "a low - temperature magnetic order is believed to be formed due to sub - leading magnetic interactions in addition to a dominant kitaev term .",
    "the in - plane order is always characteristic of the zig - zag phase .",
    "conversely , the precise three - dimensional magnetic order is fragile and easily altered by the formation of low - energy stacking faults @xcite , as proved by the drastic changes of @xmath15 and @xmath4 . from the high temperature magnetic susceptibility ,",
    "the effective paramagentic moment has been estimated as roughly @xmath74=2.2@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath75=2 , a fully ordered moment projected onto one axis would yield approximately 1.4 @xmath8 in a neutron diffraction experiment .",
    "the measured ordered moment of 0.45 @xmath8 is therefore 1/3 of the fully ordered ru@xmath9 moment . with this low ordered moment one",
    "expects that quantum spin fluctuations are dominant , and the full spectrum of magnetic excitations will not be well - described by a classical spin - wave picture .",
    "one approach might be to consider the existence of a small ordered moment as a perturbation to a qsl ground state @xcite .",
    "single crystals of @xmath0-rucl@xmath1 with minimal stacking faults are seen to consistently exhibit a low temperature crystal structure described by the @xmath2 space group .",
    "the magnetic structure consists of zig - zag planes stacked with a three layer periodicity .",
    "the best refinement of the magnetic structure is collinear with the moment directions oriented @xmath3835@xmath6 from the @xmath39 plane , consistent with expectations for edge - sharing octahedra .",
    "we argue that a structure with two antiferromagnetically aligned layers and one disordered layer is consistent with the refinements and is likely on physical grounds .",
