    "the x - ray ( @xmath1110 kev ) luminosities from galactic black hole candidate ( bhc ) transients range from values below @xmath2 erg  s@xmath3 when the sources are in quiescence @xcite to values that can approach or exceed @xmath4 erg  s@xmath3 for some sources @xcite . during outbursts , luminosities above @xmath1@xmath5 erg  s@xmath3",
    "are usually seen for at least several months @xcite , and significant changes in the x - ray properties occur over time . we do not have a detailed understanding of all the physical changes that lead to changes in the x - ray emission properties , but the physics involves the structure of the accretion disk around the black hole as well as the connection between the accretion disk and the steady or impulsive jets that can be launched from these systems .",
    "the changes in the x - ray emission properties are partially caused by changes in the mass accretion rate onto the black hole ; however , it has been demonstrated that other physical parameters must also be important for determining those properties @xcite .",
    "the emission properties of accreting black holes are often classified in terms of `` spectral states . ''",
    "recently , efforts have been made to make the state definitions more quantitative and to connect these definitions directly to the continuum spectral components @xcite .",
    "the spectra can often be described as the combination of a soft , thermal component along with a hard component that can fall off more or less steeply with energy .",
    "the thermal component is almost certainly blackbody emission from an accretion disk , as in @xcite , but the mechanism for producing the hard component is less clear .",
    "accreting black holes can be highly variable , sometimes with quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) ; spectral and timing properties are both incorporated in the following spectral state definitions from @xcite .    in the thermal - dominant ( td ) state , the thermal component accounts for @xmath675% of the total 220  kev flux . in this state ,",
    "no or weak qpos are seen with rms levels below 1% , and the 0.110  hz continuum rms is @xmath76% . in the steep power - law ( spl )",
    "state , the hard component is a power - law with @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the power - law photon index .",
    "a source is said to be in the spl state if qpos are present and the hard component contributes @xmath620% of the 220  kev flux or if , regardless of the timing properties , the hard component contributes @xmath10% of the 220  kev flux .",
    "finally , in the hard state , the hard component is much less steep , at @xmath11 , the hard component contributes more than 80% of the 220  kev flux , the 0.110  hz continuum rms is between 10% and 30% , and the presence of radio emission signals the presence of a compact jet @xcite . as discussed in @xcite , systems also exhibit intermediate states , with properties that are usually some combination of the three main states ( td , spl , and hard ) .",
    "the x - ray activity from the bhc transient 4u  163047 over more than two years during 20022004 along with good high energy coverage of the source by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ and the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral ) _ provide an opportunity to study the long - term evolution of the source as it enters different spectral states and exhibits different emission properties .",
    "4u  163047 is among the most active of the bhc transients and has produced strong hard x - ray emission during its 17 detected outbursts @xcite .",
    "the source has a quasi - periodic @xmath1600700  day outburst recurrence time @xcite , which is unusually short for systems of this type , probably indicating a higher time - averaged mass accretion rate from its companion @xcite .",
    "highly polarized radio emission was detected from 4u  163047 during its 1998 outburst @xcite , indicating the presence of jets , and the source is often compared to microquasars such as grs  1915 + 105 and gro  j165540 .",
    "the compact object mass has not been measured for 4u  163047 , but @xcite classify it as a very likely `` category a '' bhc .",
    "also , the binary orbital period is not known , and our lack of knowledge is due to the difficulty in performing optical and infrared studies of the source due to its high column density ( but see * ? ? ? * for the likely identification of the source s infrared counterpart ) .    .",
    "also , the pca count rates for the final four observations ( see panel _ b _ ) are consistent with little or no contribution to the emission from 4u  163047.[fig : lc],scaledwidth=52.0% ]    the current outburst from 4u  163047 , which began in 2002 september @xcite , is one of the brightest and longest recorded outbursts from this system . a new high - amplitude flaring behavior has been reported at different times during this outburst @xcite , and , in this work , we study this behavior in more detail . also , transitions between spectral states have been observed during this outburst @xcite .",
    "in addition to the high level of recent activity from 4u  163047 and the recent work on defining spectral states , our study comes at a time when _ integral _ is providing high quality hard x - ray images .",
    "images of the 4u  163047 field , which we present in this work and in @xcite , are extremely useful for avoiding source confusion . in the following , we present x - ray spectral and timing studies of 4u  163047 .",
    "_ rxte _ regularly monitored 4u  163047 in outburst with pointed observations between 2002 september 12 ( mjd 52,529 ) and 2005 january 4 ( mjd 53,375 ) . here , we study the evolution of the x - ray properties throughout the outburst by analyzing data from the 318 _ rxte _ observations that occurred during this time . with the exception of five 22 - 36 day observing gaps caused mainly by sun angle constraints",
    ", pointed observations occurred , on average , approximately every other day for 2.3 years .",
    "the observations were made under seven different proposal ids ( see table  [ tab : observations ] ) : in three cases ( p70113 , p80117 , and p90128 ) , we observed 4u  163047 in conjunction with our _ integral _ program ; and , in the other four cases ( p70417 , p80417 , p80420 , and p90410 ) , the observations were made under a public `` target of opportunity '' program , and we analyzed data from the public archive .",
    "the proportional counter array ( pca ) and high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) light curves shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] indicate the times of the _ rxte _ observations .",
    "after the launch of the esa satellite _ integral _ @xcite in 2002 october , we triggered our target of opportunity to observe 4u  163047 when the source became observable while it was in outburst in early 2003 .",
    "we obtained a 293 ks exposure between ut 2003 february 1.2 and ut 2003 february 5.3 , and the time of this observation is marked in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "we previously used the data from this observation for studies of the obscured x - ray source igr j163204751 (= ax j1631.94752 ) , which is a hard and persistent ( though highly variable ) source that is close to 4u  163047 @xcite , and we used these data to report detections of two other new _ integral _ sources @xcite .",
    "in addition , the 2040 kev images from this observation can be found in @xcite along with information about the sources in the _ integral _ field of view , including an initial look at the hard x - ray and gamma - ray properties of 4u  163047 . although we do not present a full analysis of the _ integral _ data here , the hard x - ray _ integral _ images are important for interpreting the _ rxte _ data .",
    "diameter , corresponding to the full - width zero - intensity ( fwzi ) collimator response .",
    "we used different _",
    "rxte _ pointing positions in an attempt to minimize contamination of 4u  163047 by nearby sources.[fig : image],scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "we extracted energy spectra and light curves from the _ rxte _ data using scripts developed at the university of california , san diego and the university of tbingen that incorporate the standard software for _ rxte _ data reduction ( ftools ) .",
    "we processed the data using the most recent _ rxte _ calibration files , which were released on 2003 july 7 , and performed extractions using ftools v5.3 and v5.3.1 .",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "routines are identical for these two versions of ftools .",
    "we performed time filtering for the 330 observations using data from times during which the following criteria are satisfied : the _ rxte _ pointing is within @xmath12 of the nominal pointing position ; the nominal pointing position is more than @xmath13 above the limb of the earth ; a south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) passage has not occurred within the previous 30 minutes ; proportional counter unit ( pcu ) 2 is turned on ; and the pcu 2 electron ratio is less than 0.25 .",
    "we chose pcu 2 because , in normal _ rxte _ operation , this unit is programmed to have a very high duty cycle to allow for the most precise observation - to - observation comparisons .",
    "our filtering led to zero exposure time for only 12 out of 330 observations ( 3.6% ) , leaving us with 318 observations for further study .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : observations ] , we typically obtained 13 ks of exposure time per observation , but exposure times vary greatly from 96 s up to 11 ks . for all 318 observations , the mean exposure time is 1.8 ks .",
    "we extracted the following information for each observation : the 320 kev pcu 2 count rate ; the 39 kev pcu 2 count rate ; the 920 kev pcu 2 count rate ; the 20100 kev hexte - a count rate ; the 3200 kev pca+hexte energy spectrum ; and the 320 kev pca light curve with 16 s time bins .",
    "we took the pca information from the `` standard 2 '' data , which includes 129 channel energy spectra taken with 16 s time resolution .",
    "we used the `` sky - vle '' model to estimate and subtract off the background .",
    "for hexte , we used `` event list '' data , and we used the normal hexte rocking mode to estimate and subtract off the background .",
    "as described below in ",
    "@xmath14 , we also selected five observations for more detailed study , and , for these , we used the higher time resolution pca data to produce power spectra . for four of the observations , we used a pca mode with 64 energy channels and @xmath15  s (= 122 @xmath16s ) time resolution . in the fifth case , we combined the data from two pca modes : a mode with @xmath17  s ( 7.8 ms ) time resolution , covering the lower energy portion of the spectrum ; and a second mode with higher time resolution , containing an event list for the higher energy photons .",
    "we used data from all the active pcus when producing the power spectra .    _ integral _ hard x - ray images from the observation described above ,",
    "show that 4u  163047 lies in a region of the galaxy that has a high density of hard x - ray sources , including a source , igr j163204751 , that is @xmath18 from 4u  163047 .",
    "the 2040 kev imager on - board the _ integral _ satellite ( ibis ) image , produced using the off - line scientific analysis ( osa-4.2 ) software @xcite , is shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "when we realized that there is another hard x - ray source within the _ rxte _ field - of - view ( fov ) for the nominal 4u  163047 pointing position , we requested a change in the pointing position to avoid igr j163204751 . from mjd 52,691 to 52,722 , we used the pointing position marked `` offset # 1 '' in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "however , the presence of igr j163934643 @xcite and a third x - ray transient , igr j163584726 @xcite , prompted another change in pointing position to `` offset # 2 , '' and we used this pointing position from mjd 52,722 to 52,781 .",
    "the pca and hexte collimators have a triangular response with a full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) fov of @xmath19 and a full - width zero - intensity ( fwzi ) fov of @xmath20 .",
    "where necessary in the work described below , we corrected for the collimator response when producing light curves or response matrices for spectral analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc]a shows the _ rxte _ all - sky monitor ( asm ) 1.512 kev light curve for 4u  163047 with the source in outburst from 2002 september to the end of 2004 .",
    "in addition to being the longest outburst during the _ rxte _ lifetime , at its peak , its asm flux is @xmath1800 mcrab ( 1 crab = 74 asm c / s ) , which is @xmath150% brighter than any previous outburst observed by the asm .",
    "below , we divide the outburst into the various spectral states the source entered , but , in general , the asm light curve shows two very bright and highly variable periods : the first occurred for @xmath1120 days between mjd 52,530 and @xmath152,650 ; and the second occurred for @xmath1200 days in 2003 between mjd 52,750 and 52,950 .",
    "the source was also bright for much of 2004 , but it did not become as bright as the previous two periods of very high activity . twice in 2003 and once in early 2004 , the source flux was low enough to be only marginally detected by the asm .",
    "the source became undetectable again in late 2004 , and it appears that the source has remained in quiescence into 2005 .    figure  [ fig : lc]b shows the count rates measured in the 320 kev band by the pca during the pointed _ rxte _ observations .",
    "for the observations made at the offset pointing positions , the count rates are corrected using the pca collimator response .",
    "the _ rxte _ monitoring program began soon after the source was detected by the asm .",
    "while the source flux was at the asm sensitivity limit at times , the pca , with its better sensitivity , shows continuous activity until 2004 november 16 ( mjd 53,326 ) .",
    "after this date , there was a 36 day gap in coverage , and we obtained four more pca measurements after this gap . for these observations ,",
    "the pca rates are consistent with galactic ridge emission and flux from igr  j163204751 , with little or no emission from 4u  163047 .",
    "they are not included in the spectral and timing analysis in the next two sections ( leaving 314 observations ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc]c shows the hexte - a 20100 kev count rate , and figure  [ fig : lc]d shows the source hardness , defined as the ratio of the 920 kev pca rate to the 39 kev pca rate .",
    "for the 314 observations , we used the xspec v11.3.1 t software to perform @xmath21-minimization spectral fits to the pca+hexte 3200 kev energy spectra . for the pca spectra ,",
    "we included systematic errors at a level of 0.6% for 38 kev and at a level of 0.3% for 825 kev , and these numbers are derived by fitting energy spectra of the crab nebula as described in @xcite . for many of the observations , the standard two component model ",
    "disk - blackbody @xcite plus power - law with interstellar absorption  provides acceptable fits , but , for 31 observations , we obtain @xmath22 for 63 degrees of freedom ( dof ) , and , for the 314 observations , the mean @xmath23 is 1.51 . by examining the residuals for several of the spectra with statistically poor fits , we found two main reasons for the poor fits",
    ". first , in many cases , large residuals ( positive and negative ) are present around the iron k@xmath24 complex .",
    "second , negative residuals are sometimes seen at high energies , above 50 kev , indicating the presence of a cutoff in the spectrum .",
    "the presence of iron features and high energy cutoffs are not surprising as they have been seen previously for 4u  163047 as well as for other black hole sources @xcite .",
    "thus , we refitted all the energy spectra after adding a narrow iron k@xmath24 emission line and a smeared iron edge @xcite in a similar manner to that described in @xcite .",
    "we restricted the line energies to be between 6.4 kev and 7.1 kev , spanning the possible iron k@xmath24 range for non - redshifted lines .",
    "similarly , we restricted the edge energy to be between 7.1 kev and 9.3 kev .",
    "sample fits to several spectra show that the width of the smeared edge is not well - constrained in most cases , and we fixed the width to 10 kev @xcite .",
    "we also added a high energy cutoff allowing the model to exponentially turn - over above an energy @xmath25 with an e - folding energy of @xmath26 .",
    "finally , although the column density ( @xmath27 ) has been fixed to values close to @xmath28 @xmath29 in some previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the results for this _ rxte _ data set indicate significant changes during the outburst .",
    "thus , we have left @xmath27 as a free parameter , except that we have restricted the column density to be greater than @xmath30 @xmath29 , which is the lowest value that has been measured for 4u  163047 by a soft x - ray instrument @xcite .",
    "this value may represent the interstellar value along the line of sight .    .",

    "( _ d _ ) shows the power - law photon index .",
    "( _ e _ ) shows the power - law ratio ( see text for definition ) . in panels ( _ b _ ) through ( _ e _ ) , an average - sized error bar is shown , although it should be noted that there is some variation in the error bar size from observation - to - observation ( see table  [ tab : spectra ] ) .",
    "[ fig : parameters],scaledwidth=52.0% ]    these additions to the spectral model produce significant improvements in the quality of the fits . for the 314 spectra ,",
    "the mean @xmath23 is 1.15 for 57 dof , and only 13 have @xmath22 .",
    "we examined the spectral residuals as well as the 16 s light curves for the cases where the worst fits are obtained . in most of these cases ,",
    "the light curves show a high degree of variability , suggesting that spectral variability during the observation degrades the quality of the fits .",
    "however , in several cases , the level of variability is not particularly high , and , in four of these observations , significant positive residuals are present at high energies , above @xmath140 kev . although it is possible that these residuals indicate a high energy excess from 4u  163047 , the observations for which the excess is present occurred at the nominal pointing position for 4u  163047 so that the _ rxte _ field of view includes the persistent hard x - ray source igr j163204751 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : image ] ) . using _",
    "integral _ flux measurements and _ rxte _ pointings at the 4u  163047 position during times when 4u  163047 was not active , we demonstrate in appendix a that the positive high energy residuals are very likely caused by igr j163204751 .",
    "the four observations with positive high energy residuals occurred between mjd 52,560 and 52,596 , and , as the spectra for these four observations are likely contaminated , we do not consider them in the following analysis .    figure  [ fig : parameters ] shows the pca rates and spectral parameters vs.  time .",
    "the spectral parameters shown include the temperature of the disk - blackbody component ( @xmath31 ) , the normalization of this component ( @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the inner radius of the accretion disk in km , @xmath34 is the source distance in units of 10 kpc , and @xmath35 is the disk inclination ) , the power - law photon index ( @xmath9 ) , and the ratio of the unabsorbed 220  kev power - law flux to the total flux ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "when the entire outburst is considered , the range of @xmath31 values is 0.493.81 kev , while the range is 0.634.13 for @xmath9 .",
    "we use the spectral parameters and the @xcite state definitions to divide the observations into different spectral states , and the classifications are indicated in figure  [ fig : parameters ] .",
    "the steep power - law ( spl ) observations have @xmath8 and @xmath37 .",
    "those in the thermal - dominant ( td ) state have @xmath38 . the source was only in the hard state with @xmath11 and @xmath39 for two observations near mjd 53,069 .",
    "the remainder of the observations do not fit into any of the spectral states as defined by @xcite , and we say that the source was in one or more intermediate states ( is ) during these observations . it should be noted that we have divided the observations into spectral states using only spectral and not timing information . while timing information is important to the study of spectral states and",
    "is part of the full @xcite definitions , our results for a sample of the power spectra ( see  @xmath14 ) show that the timing properties are in - line with the @xcite criteria for the various states .",
    "if we had included timing information in dividing up the spectral states , it is possible that some td observations with higher noise levels would be re - classified as is and that if some of the is or td observations have qpos they may be re - classified as spl . however , such re - classifications would not change the results or conclusions of this work .",
    "there are seven observations with distinctly different spectra . for these observations ,",
    "the power - law is very hard with values of @xmath9 between 0.6 and 1.7 , and it is sharply cutoff with e - folding energies between 10 and 50 kev .",
    "while such a spectrum would represent the discovery of a new black hole state , we strongly suspect that these observations are contaminated by emission from the hard x - ray transient igr  j163584726 .",
    "although igr  j163584726 was not detected during our 2003 february _ integral _ observation ( see figure  [ fig : image ] ) , four of the observations for which we see the very hard x - ray spectrum occurred during the time period from mjd 52,701 to 52,722 , when the source was known to be active @xcite . during this time period",
    ", we used the offset # 1 pointing position , so the field of view included igr  j163584726 but not igr  j163204751 .",

    "we include details about the hard spectra , as they provide useful information on igr  j163584726 .",
    "other than in appendix b , we do not consider these observations further .",
    "an inspection of the 320 kev 16  s pca light curves for all 314 observations indicates that in addition to the observation - to - observation variability that is clearly seen in figures  [ fig : lc ] and [ fig : parameters ] , many of the light curves show high amplitude variability during the observations . to quantify the level of variability",
    ", we calculated the peak - to - peak amplitude for each observation , @xmath40 , defined simply as the maximum pca count rate minus the minimum rate divided by the mean rate for the observation . the errors on @xmath40 depend on the uncertainties in the count rates for the individual maximum and minimum 16 s time bins as well as the error in the mean rate .",
    "for the 314 observations , the mean value of @xmath40 is 0.26 and the standard deviation is 0.20 .",

    "there are 72 observations with high - amplitude variability .     and [ fig : parameters ] .",
    "note that the observations for ( _ a _ ) , ( _ c _ ) , and ( _ d _ ) were made in the nominal pointing position while the observation for ( _ b _ ) was made in one of the offset pointing positions.[fig : lc16f],scaledwidth=52.0% ]    , scaledwidth=52.0% ]    a more careful examination of the 72 light curves with high - amplitude variability indicates that there are at least four types of high - amplitude variability , and examples of the most common type are shown in figure  [ fig : lc16f ] while the other three types are shown in figure  [ fig : lc16o ] .",
    "the light curves shown in figure  [ fig : lc16f ] can be interpreted as a series of 10100  s flares ; however , in some of the light curves the flares occur so often that it is difficult to distinguish the individual flares .",
    "we refer to this as `` flaring '' behavior below , and we chose the examples to illustrate that flaring occurs over a wide range of times during the outburst as shown in figures  [ fig : lc ] and [ fig : parameters ] . while all of the examples shown in figure  [ fig : lc16f ] are from is observations , flaring also sometimes occurs during observations classified as td and spl .",

    "the dip shown in figure  [ fig : lc16o]a is very similar to the dip observed from 4u  163047 during its 1996 outburst @xcite .",
    "spectral analysis of the 1996 dip indicates that it is likely caused by absorption , perhaps from accretion disk material , but the fact that the dip is not spectrally hard indicates partial covering of the x - ray source @xcite .",
    "similarly , the dip shown in figure  [ fig : lc16o]a shows , at most , only a moderate level of hardening .    a third type of variability is illustrated in figure  [ fig : lc16o]c and can be described as short , 1020  s dips , and similar dips have been reported during the 1998 outburst from 4u  163047 @xcite .",
    "the hardness ratio indicates that the spectrum becomes softer during the dips . during this outburst",
    ", we only see these short , soft dips during the three observations from mjd 52,794.289 , 52,795.340 , and 52,801.445 , and a total of 7 or 8 short dips are seen in the 19  ks of exposure time accumulated for these three observations , which are all classified as spl .",
    "the final type of high - amplitude variability is shown in figure  [ fig : lc16o]d and consists of a single , very hard flare that occurred at the end of the observation performed on mjd 53,087.832 , at which time the source was in the td state .",
    "the flare did not occur close to the time of any saa passage , and we checked that the pca electron ratio was not high during the time of the flare , indicating that the flare did not have any instrumental or environmental cause .",
    "in addition , we checked for solar flares using the x - ray data from the solar x - ray imager ( sxi ) on the geostationary operational environmental satellites ( goes-12 ) , but the sun did not flare during the _ rxte _ observation .",
    "finally , we extracted a 16 s hexte light curve , and we see that hexte also detected the hard flare . thus , we conclude that origin of the flare was an astronomical source in the _ rxte _ field - of - view . it is likely that the flare came from 4u  163047 , but we can not rule out the possibility that it came from one of the other sources in the field - of - view , such as igr  j163584726 or igr  j163204751 .",

    "for example , the shape of the soft component can be drastically changed if the disk opacity is dominated by electron scattering rather than free - free absorption @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this effect can cause measurements of inner disk radii to be underestimated by a factor of five or more @xcite .",

    "this can lead to significantly more material , and thus emission , at small radii and can also produce a much flatter radial temperature profile ( @xmath59 ) , with a change in @xmath60 from 0.75 to @xmath10.5 @xcite . as a final example of the limitations of the diskbb model , it has been shown that assumptions about the boundary conditions at the inner radius of the disk can be important .",

    "kubota and co - workers show how effects of electron scattering and changes in the radial temperature profile can manifest themselves @xcite . following these studies , we plot in figure  [ fig : dl ] the disk temperature ( @xmath31 ) vs. the bolometric disk luminosity ( @xmath61 ) as derived from the 4u  163047 diskbb parameters . in deriving the luminosity",

    "first , several is and hard state observations at the lower luminosities ( @xmath7@xmath64 erg  s@xmath3 ) show disk temperatures well below values that would be consistent with the line of constant @xmath33 .",
    "these are cases for which the overall source luminosity and presumably also the mass accretion rate are low , and these are likely cases where the inner disk radius increases or at least where the inner part of the disk is radiatively inefficient .",
    "a second region of deviation includes td , is , and some of the spl observations and occurs at the highest disk luminosities .",
    "this flattening of the @xmath61-@xmath31 relationship may be similar to what has been seen for xte  j1550564 at high @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "for xte  j1550564 , @xcite showed that the relationship flattened to a slope close to @xmath58 , which could be an indication of a transition to a slim disk based on the work of @xcite . in 4u  163047 , it is clear from figure  [ fig : dl ] that the source leaves the solid line above @xmath1@xmath65 erg  s@xmath3 , and it appears that it may begin to follow the @xmath66 relationship ( the dotted line in figure  [ fig : dl ] ) for at least some luminosity range .",
    "however , the source appears to deviate from the @xmath66 relationship at the very highest values of @xmath61 , and it is possible that the source recovers the @xmath67 relationship ( the dashed line in figure  [ fig : dl ] ) . although the exact evolution is not completely clear , it is interesting that the observations at the highest values of @xmath61 that deviate from the solid line are also the observations for which the high - amplitude flaring occurred ( see figure  [ fig : dl]b ) . for transitions between the standard disk and the slim disk ,",
    "theory predicts a limit cycle with a region of instability in between the two solutions .",
    "thus , the flaring may be a consequence of the limit cycle , and below this is a possibility we explore further .",
    "a third region of deviation from the line of constant @xmath33 is contains mostly spl observations for which @xmath31 is extremely high , including 15 observations with @xmath31 between 2.7 and 3.8  kev . along with extremely high temperatures , the spectra exhibit very low values of @xmath68 in the range of 1.212.3 , implying values of @xmath33 that are unphysical . as an example , for a source distance of 10  kpc and a binary inclination of @xmath57 ( as assumed above ) , this range of normalizations indicate inner radii between 1.5 and 5.0 km ; the former being an order of magnitude lower than the gravitational radius of a 10  black hole . rather than extremely small inner disk radii ,",
    "these high temperatures and luminosities are much more likely to be caused by spectral hardening due to the dominance of electron scattering in the inner region of the accretion disk .",
    "although the explanation for the high spl state values of @xmath31 is very likely electron scattering , it is notable that the extremely high temperatures are seen for such a large number of observations . during its 1998 outburst , 4u  163047 entered the spl state , and fits to _ rxte _ spectra gave @xmath691.7 kev and @xmath70 @xcite , which are considerably less extreme when compared to the 20022004 values .",

    "however , from the spectral evidence alone , we can not rule out that the disk temperature rises because of an increase in the mass accretion rate .",
    "although the spectral analysis indicates that changes in the accretion disk are important in producing the flaring , one might also ask whether the flaring behavior could have any physical connection to outflows or jets in the system . for example , in the case of the bhc h  1743322 , from which spectrally hard flares were also recently detected , the flaring was accompanied by the presence of blue - shifted absorption lines detected in spectra taken with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite . as these authors point out , the blue - shifting of the lines strongly suggest the presence of an outflow .",
    "in addition , @xcite find that the line strength varies during the @xmath1300  s variations seen in h  1743322 , and @xcite suggest the possibility that , if the outflow is energetic enough , it may be able to produce hard emission via up - scattering . for 4u  163047 , we do not have information about the presence of absorption lines , but , as our spectral analysis indicates that the flaring is connected to the accretion disk , a link between the flaring and an outflow would represent an important disk / jet connection .",
    "one might expect that an outflow energetic enough to lead to strong flares would also lead to a high level of radio emission .",

    "the thick - lined arrow with the filled arrowhead shows the counter - clockwise motion seen for the 1998 outburst . for the 20022004 outburst",
    ", the pattern of the motion is complicated as shown by the thin - lined arrows with the un - filled arrowheads .",
    "[ fig : hi],scaledwidth=52.0% ]    these patterns are especially interesting in light of recent work on connections between black hole x - ray states , a source s position in the hardness - intensity diagram , and radio jet ejections @xcite .",
    "a general pattern seen in a number of bhc outbursts is that the systems will evolve from the hard state to an intermediate state and then a radio ejection will occur during the subsequent transition to the spl state @xcite .",
    "@xcite use the hardness - intensity diagram to quantify this effect , and it should be noted that they follow @xcite by using somewhat different terminology , describing the transition from the is to the spl states as a transition from the `` hard intermediate '' state to the `` soft intermediate '' state .",
    "@xcite suggest that each bhc system has a threshold hardness and that major jet ejections are only produced when the source crosses this `` jet - line '' from a high to a low hardness level .",
    "if this is the case , figure  [ fig : hi ] suggests that the jet - line for 4u  163047 may be around a hardness of 0.4 .",
    "our results for 4u  163047 provide evidence in favor of the jet - line concept ; however , based on the behavior of 4u  163047 , it is not entirely clear if the presence of a radio jet in 1998 occurred because the outburst was harder overall or if the source simply entering a bright hard state led to the jet ejection .",
    "our analysis of this data also provides a test of the quantitative spectral state definitions of @xcite . in some ways ,",
    "these definitions are quite successful .",
    "for example , it is impressive that the only two observations with spectral parameters meeting the hard state requirements are also the only two we found with power spectra that include a strong band - limited noise component .",
    "also , looking at the hardness - intensity diagram in figure  [ fig : hi ] , these two observations lie at the extreme end of the c - shaped pattern . however ,",
    "in other areas , the definitions appear to be less satisfactory .",
    "although most of the observations labeled as spl lie at the other end of the c - shaped pattern in the hardness - intensity diagram , the spl observations have a extremely wide variety of properties .",
    "for example , for about half of the spl observations @xmath31 lies in the 2.73.8  kev range , while the other half have temperatures @xmath861.8  kev .",
    "we argue above that there are important physical differences between these two groups . also , it is notable that over half of the observations made during the 20022004 outburst are put in the is , meaning that a large fraction of the observations have x - ray properties that do not meet the requirements for any of the @xcite states .",
    "overall , while the @xcite criteria appear to be useful for classifying the observations at the extremes of bhc behavior , it should be recognized that they , by themselves , do not provide a complete description of a bhc outburst due to significant variations in properties within states and the large fraction of is observations .",
    "outstanding _ rxte _ coverage of 4u  163047 during its 20022004 outburst has allowed us to study the detailed evolution of its x - ray spectral and timing properties over a period of more than 2 years . historically , this outburst is among the longest and brightest seen in 36 years of observing 4u  163047 , and it is very likely that it is the largest ever observed in terms of total mass transfer .    the x - ray properties during this outburst were also extreme , including 15 observations with very high disk - blackbody inner disk temperatures between 2.7 and 3.8  kev .",
    "the inner disk radii inferred from these fits are unphysically small , and it is likely that the high temperatures and small radii are caused by electron scattering .",
    "this explanation requires a spectral hardening factor of @xmath87 , implying a source luminosity that is considerably higher than 20% of the eddington limit @xcite , which is not unreasonable as we measure 3200  kev luminosities of @xmath88 erg  s@xmath3 ( @xmath89/10 kpc)@xmath90 .    at the highest disk luminosities",
    ", we detect a deviation from the @xmath0 relationship ( line of constant @xmath33 ) seen at lower luminosities as well as high - amplitude flaring .",
    "the deviation may be a sign of a transition from a standard disk to a slim disk as suggested by kubota and co - workers .",
    "the flaring behavior of 4u  163047 may be consistent with this interpretation as a zone of instability is expected between the two disk solutions .",
    "also , our spectral analysis of flaring observations , showing that @xmath31 is correlated with pca count rate is consistent with a change from a standard disk to a slim disk .",
    "although sensitive radio observations occurred during the 20022004 outburst , no strong radio emission that would indicate the presence of radio jets was detected .",
    "this is interesting in light of the fact that the x - ray properties were very different during the 1998 outburst when radio jet emission was detected .",
    "compared to the 20022004 outburst , the 1998 outburst hardness - intensity diagram was shifted to a higher hardness level , and , in 1998 , the source entered into a bright and hard state , while it did not in 20022004 .",
    "these findings support the connections between radio jets and spectral states found by @xcite and the jet - line idea recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "finally , our analysis of a large number of _ rxte _ observations has provided a good test of the quantitative @xcite spectral state definitions .",
    "while the hard state appears to be well - defined , the spectral and timing properties of the observations selected as spl are highly non - uniform .",
    "also , it is notable that over half of the observations are put in the is because they do not meet the requirements of any of the @xcite definitions .",
    "the results show that 4u  163047 exhibits many properties not encompassed by the @xcite definitions that are likely to be physically important .",

    "we thank the referee , tomaso belloni , for a useful report that helped us to improve the manuscript .      as described in  @xmath91 above , there are four _ rxte _ observations for which we see strong positive residuals at high energies ( @xmath9230 kev ) after fitting the pca plus hexte spectra with our standard spectral model .",
    "these occur for observations made at the nominal pointing position , and during these observations , igr j163204751 was in the field - of - view ( fov ) , @xmath18 from 4u  163047 and the center of the fov . due to the high level of activity from igr j163204751 ,",
    "its known hard spectrum , and its known strong variability ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , we suspect that this source may be producing much of the high energy emission that we see in the four observations with strong positive residuals . as a test , we compare the flux of the high energy emission seen in one of these observations ( observation i d 70417 - 01 - 07 - 02 taken on mjd 52,539.094 ) to measurements of igr j163204751 taken at other times .",
    "our 2003 february _ integral _ observation provides the cleanest measurement of the high energy flux from igr j163204751 . from the @xcite analysis of the isgri spectrum , the peak 2060  kev flux during this observation",
    "is @xmath93 erg  @xmath29  s@xmath3 , and the energy spectrum is consistent with a power - law with @xmath9 between 2.6 and 3.1 . in figure",
    "[ fig : spectra_a ] , we plot the _ rxte _ spectrum for observation i d 70417 - 01 - 07 - 02 and the 2060  kev flux measured by _ integral _ @xmath1135 days later .",
    "we reduced the _ integral _ flux appropriately to account for the _ rxte _ collimator response at the location of igr j163204751 .",
    "although the measured _ integral _ flux at the time of the _ integral _ observation is a factor of @xmath123 too low to explain the strong residuals , long - term variability at higher levels than this has been reported from igr j163204751 @xcite , making it probable that the source gets bright enough to explain the strong residuals at times .",
    "further evidence that igr j163204751 is sometimes bright enough to explain the strong residuals comes from _ rxte _ observations made of 4u  163047 between 1999 december 25 and 2000 january 14 .",
    "these observations were made when 4u  163047 was in quiescence in an effort to observe 4u  163047 as it turned - on ; however , it did not turn on during this sequence of 36 very short ( typically 500  s ) observations . during this sequence of observations ( observation ids 40112 - 01 - 01 - 00 to 40112 - 01 - 36 - 00 ) the pca count rate varied significantly between 8 and 26 c / s / pcu .",
    "although some of the detected emission is probably galactic ridge emission , the high level of variability indicates that a compact source is producing much of the flux , and igr j163204751 is the most likely candidate . in figure",
    "[ fig : spectra_a ] , we show the pca spectrum from the observation with the highest count rate , which was made on 2000 january 11 ( observation i d 40112 - 01 - 31 - 00 ) .",
    "we note that no collimator response correction is necessary because the pointing position is approximately the same for this observation and for 70417 - 01 - 07 - 02 .",
    "another technical note is that although we attempted to also use hexte , with such short observations in a crowded field , this was not straightforward .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra_a ] indicates that the source was very hard @xmath94 , and the extension of this spectrum is more than bright enough to explain the high energy residuals , even if the spectrum breaks above 20  kev . in summary , this analysis provides strong evidence that igr j163204751 is the cause of the high energy residuals .",
    "in addition to the four observations discussed in appendix a , there are seven other observations for which it is likely that the high energy emission is dominated by a source other than 4u  163047 .",
    "the spectral parameters for these seven observations are shown in figure  [ fig : parameters ] , and these are the extremely hard observations with @xmath9 in the 0.61.7 range . as discussed in  @xmath91 above , four of the seven observations ( 70113 - 01 - 20 - 00 , 70113 - 01 - 21 - 00 , 70113 - 01 - 25 - 00 , and 70113 - 01 - 28 - 00 ) occurred during a time period when igr j163584726 was active according to reports from _ integral _ , _ chandra _ and other _ rxte _ observations @xcite . as was the case for igr j163204751 ,",
    "_ integral _ provides the cleanest measurement of the high energy flux due to its imaging capabilities , and @xcite report a 1540 kev flux of 50 mcrab ( @xmath1@xmath95 erg  cm@xmath3  s@xmath3 ) and a 40100 kev flux of 20 mcrab ( @xmath1@xmath97 erg  cm@xmath3  s@xmath3 ) . on mjd 52,727.4 .",
    "our observation 70113 - 01 - 25 - 00 occurred on the same day ( mjd 52,727.633 ) , and , after correcting the _ rxte _ collimator response for the position of igr j163584726 , which is @xmath98 from the center of the `` offset # 1 '' fov , we measure 1540 and 40100 kev fluxes of @xmath99 and @xmath100 erg  cm@xmath3  s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the 1540  kev flux is a factor of 2.7 lower than the _ integral _ measurement , and the 40100  kev is nearly the same in the two cases .",
    "although the 1540  kev flux measured by _ rxte _ is somewhat low , the difference is consistent with a report by @xcite that the flux varies by a factor of @xmath12 on a time scale of hours .",
    "more importantly , the flux comparison confirms our suspicion that the 4u  163047 spectrum is contaminated by the flux from igr j163584726 at high energies .",
    "although it is clear that we are seeing emission from igr j163584726 in four of the seven observations with low values of @xmath9 , it is less clear whether the high energy emission for the other three observations : 80420 - 01 - 15 - 00 made on mjd 53,002.863 ; 80117 - 01 - 24 - 00 made on mjd 53,076.664 ; 90410 - 01 - 01 - 01 made on mjd 53,114.410 ; is also dominated by igr j163584726 because no _ integral _ detections of igr j163584726 were reported and also because igr j163204751 was in the _ rxte _ fov for these three observations . in figure",
    "[ fig : spectra_b ] , we compare the pca plus hexte spectrum from 90410 - 01 - 01 - 01 to that of 70113 - 01 - 25 - 00 , where we know the emission is from igr j163584726 , and the spectra are remarkably similar . after correcting for the _ rxte _ collimator response , the 1540 and 40100  kev fluxes for 90410 - 01 - 01 - 01 are about a factor of 1.8 higher than for 70113 - 01 - 25 - 00 .",
    "even though this may be considered an argument in favor of the emission being from igr j163584726 , igr j163204751 is also known to produce very hard ( @xmath101 ) spectra at times @xcite .",
    "15 kev is dominated by another source .",
    "the black _ rxte _ spectrum ( thin histogram ) from observation i d 70113 - 01 - 25 - 00 was taken on the same day as an _ integral _ observation of the region , and we argue in the text that it is very likely that the high energy flux comes from igr j163584726 .",
