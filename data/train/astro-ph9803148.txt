    "the light elements lithium , beryllium , and boron are of great interest out of proportion to their very low abundances , having implications in big bang nucleosynthesis and stellar structure , as well as in constraints on models of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the `` canonical '' theory of the origin of the elements li , be , and b was first presented by reeves , fowler , & hoyle ( 1970 ) and further developed by meneguzzi , audouze , & reeves ( 1971 ) , and then reeves , audouze , fowler , & schramm ( 1973 ) . in this model , most light element formation can be accounted for by galactic cosmic rays ( gcr ) impinging on the interstellar medium ( ism ) , assuming a constant flux of gcrs through the life of the galaxy and making reasonable assumptions about cr confinement by the galactic magnetic field .",
    "meneguzzi  ( 1971 ) also introduced the idea of a large ( up to three orders of magnitude ) increase in the low energy ( 5 - 40 mev nucleon@xmath6 ) cr flux ; since crs in this energy range are mostly shielded from the solar system by the solar wind , they are not detectable",
    ". this additional cr flux increased the production of all light elements and matched the isotopic ratios and total abundances to the accuracy known at the time .",
    "reeves & meyer ( 1978 ) added the additional constraint that models should match not only present - day abundances but their evolution throughout the life of the galaxy .",
    "their conclusions were similar to mar , except that they had to introduce infall of light - element - free matter into the galactic disk to match the evolution with time .",
    "in retrospect , it can be seen that the data they were fitting were sparse and not very precise . with the launch of the the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and the availability of uv - sensitive ccd detectors ( b is usually observed at @xmath72500 and be at @xmath73130 ) , data are now much more numerous and accurate , and abundances can be traced from the epoch of formation of the galactic halo until the present day .    in the past several years ,",
    "the evolution of li , be , and b has been used as a test of different models of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "for example , in the models of vangioni - flam ( 1990 ) , ryan  ( 1992 ) , and prantzos  ( pcv ; 1993 ) , light element production depends on the intensity and shape of the gcr spectrum , which in turn depends on the supernova ( sn ) and massive star formation rates .",
    "it also depends on the rise of the ( progenitor ) cno abundances and the decline of the gas mass fraction , which is affected by rates of infall of fresh ( unprocessed ) material and outflow , e.g. by sn heating .",
    "other things being equal , at early times when target cno abundances were low , light element production would be much lower for a given cr flux than presently , when the ism abundances are higher .",
    "pcv found that even with these numerous adjustable parameters , no time - independent cr spectrum can reproduce the evolution of light element abundances . by assuming a very particular form of time variation of the cr flux ( greatly enhanced at early epochs ) , they were able to ( barely ) fit the evolution of the abundances .",
    "the present investigation supports a different solution to the problem of the origin of the light elements .",
    "duncan  ( 1997 ) present b abundances in a large number of stars ranging in metallicity from @xmath2solar to [ fe / h ]  @xmath8 .",
    "they find that ( lte ) b follows metals in direct proportion from the earliest times ( very metal - poor stars ) to the present , with little if any change of slope between halo and disk metallicities .",
    "a straightforward interpretation of this is that the rate of production of b and be does _ not _ depend on the cno abundances in the ism , and that the production site is associated with the production site for metals",
    ". this would be true if the spallation process most important for light element production is not primarily protons and @xmath9 particles colliding with cno nuclei in the ism but rather c and o nuclei colliding with ambient protons and @xmath9 particles , probably in regions of massive star formation ( cf .",
    "vangioni - flam  1996 and ramaty  1997 ) .",
    "this paper focuses specifically on the b measurement in -13 ; it is consistent with ( and was used to help determine ) the relationships between lte and nlte b and [ fe / h ] seen in duncan  ( 1997 ) .",
    "the data suggest that b production at the lowest metallicities occurs in the same way as today , and thus support the new description of galactic light element production .",
    "it is possible that recent gro satellite observations of gamma rays from the orion nebula ( bloemen  1994 ; bykov & bloemen 1994 ) provide direct evidence of c and o spallation occurring today , even though not all instruments on gro detected evidence of such spallation ( murphy  1996 )",
    ". the light element data alone , however , are the strongest evidence in support of a new model of their production .",
    "the goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) of the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) was used with the g270 m grating to obtain spectra of resolution 26000 ( 0.025   pixel@xmath6 ) in the @xmath72500  region of -13 .",
    "data was collected for a total of 25.39 hours exposure time in six separate visits of the satellite over several months from december 1994 to may 1995 . the s / n of the final spectrum was 100 per pixel ( 200 per resolution element ) , limited only by photon statistics .",
    "the spectrum obtained appears in fig .  1 .",
    "these data were combined with that from 10 other stars , including three previously analyzed by duncan , lambert , & lemke ( 1992 ) and seven new stars ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath100.45 to @xmath102.75 ) , in a separate investigation ( duncan  1997 ) .",
    "special care was taken to analyze each of the stars in a similar manner , and the stars from duncan , lambert , & lemke ( 1992 ) were re - analyzed to assure consistency .",
    "see duncan  ( 1997 ) for more details .",
    "data reduction followed the standard _",
    "hst _ procedure , using the iraf stsdas package , combining the quarter - stepped , fp - split data within each visit with the tasks poffsets and specalign , which perform a generalized least - squares solution for the photocathode granularity and the true spectrum .",
    "since specalign equally weights the input spectra , exposures from separate visits were shifted and combined using the separate tasks shiftlines and scombine , weighting the data by the number of counts in the raw spectrum from each visit . by comparing subsets of the data ,",
    "it was confirmed that the photon statistics limit was reached and that the line in question was present in both data sets if the data was arbitrarily divided in half , and not substantially altered by any exposure or by texture on the photocathode .",
    "spectrum synthesis using the latest kurucz model atmospheres was used to determine log ( b ) , with particular attention paid to the errors .",
    "an accurate determination of the uncertainties is required in the subsequent discussion of the results , to permit judgement of the goodness - of - fit of models of galactic chemical evolution and to discriminate among the different proposed mechanisms of light element formation , particularly because this star is the most metal - poor yet investigated for boron .",
    "spectrum synthesis was done using the synthe program distributed by kurucz ( 1993 ) on cd - rom .",
    "this program assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) in determining level populations and calculating the emergent spectrum .",
    "scripts written by steve allen ( uc santa cruz ) were used to run the program on unix sparcstations .",
    "the most recent grid of model atmospheres , also released by kurucz on cd - rom , includes the blanketing of almost 60 million lines , both atomic and molecular . as in our parallel study of the galactic evolution of boron , ( duncan  1997 )",
    ", we used the linelist of the duncan  ( 1997b ) study of b in the hyades giants , which consists almost entirely of laboratory - measured lines .",
    "it has been carefully tested in order to fit both the hyades giants and various metal - poor stars in the b @xmath72500 region .",
    "this list was constructed by starting with kurucz s lowlines list ( cd - rom #  1 ) , adjusting ( reducing ) some  values where necessary , and adding some predicted  lines in order to achieve a good match to the absorption features near the  lines .",
    "the  value for the  2496.708    line which blends with the short wavelength component of the  doublet is the same as that of the higher resolution study of edvardsson  ( 1994 ) . in our linelist",
    ", the  values and wavelengths of the  resonant doublet were selected from obrian & lawler ( 1992 ) .",
    "they differ by only 0.03  dex and @xmath110.01    from the values given by kurucz .",
    "our abundances are derived from fitting the shorter wavelength , less blended component of the b doublet , with the longer wavelength component examined as a consistency check .    as in duncan  ( 1997 ) , the kurucz default abundance of log ( b)=2.57 is used as our solar b value .",
    "this decision affects the choice of the zero point of the abundance scale and does not affect the interpretation of trends in the b data discussed in the present paper .",
    "the kurucz model grid is given in steps of 250  k in , 0.50 in , and 0.50  dex in [ fe / h ] ( at least for halo stars ) .",
    "we determined the physical parameters and their uncertainties for the program star from an extensive search of the literature and performed calculations at the nearest grid points . within the range of values determined from the literature ,",
    "models from the kurucz grid which best fit our entire uv spectrum were chosen .",
    "experiments with linear interpolation between grid models were also performed .",
    "the kurucz models we used assume all metals scale together , whereas it is known that @xmath9-elements are enhanced at low metallicities .",
    "in duncan  ( 1997 ) , testing showed that the effect of @xmath9-enhancement on the structure of the model atmosphere produces very small effects on the calculated b abundances .",
    "in particular , the three stars originally studied by duncan , lambert , & lemke ( 1992 ) were analyzed by them using atmospheres with @xmath9-enhanced composition from gustafsson  ( 1975 ) . analyzing them with the methods of the present paper produced differences in b abundance within 0.04  dex , much lower than the other errors associated with the abundance determination .",
    "the direct effect of an enhanced co abundance could be larger due to the particular line  @xmath12   which is blended with the shorter wavelength b component .",
    "this is discussed further in the section on uncertainties .",
    "the atmospheric models we used were computed with a microturbulent velocity of 2  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "we did not find it necessary to change to the commonly accepted value of 1.5  km  s@xmath6 for halo stars ( magain 1989 ) , because analysis of several curves of growth showed that the dependence of b abundances on this stellar parameter is negligible , though microturbulence would affect the blending co line , which we discuss more fully below .",
    "2 presents spectrum synthesis fits for -13 ; the fits presented are calculated to have log ( b)=+0.3 , + 0.1 , and @xmath100.4 , the latter indicates what the abundance would be if this star had the solar b to metals ratio .",
    "table  1 presents the stellar parameters and b abundance for -13 .",
    "table  1 also presents parameters from the three most metal - poor stars of our recent study ( duncan  1997 ) : hd  140283 , which for several years was the most metal - poor star with detected b ( duncan  1992 ) , and bd  @xmath133  740 .",
    "the metallicities determined by us for these stars are consistent with the ranges found by other workers ( see compilation by cayrel de strobel  1997 ) . fig .",
    "3 compares the observed spectra of -13  with that of hd  140283 and bd  @xmath133  740 .",
    "it is clear that -13  is the most metal - poor of the three stars .",
    ".stellar parameters and b abundances [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the largest source of systematic errors in our b abundance is likely to be due to nlte effects .",
    "as calculated by kiselman ( 1994 ) , and kiselman & carlsson ( 1996 ) , nlte effects increase b abundances most significantly in the most metal - poor stars .",
    "the relatively hot uv radiation fields in metal - poor stars drive the detailed balance of the b resonance lines away from statistical equilibrium .",
    "overionization and optical pumping tend to weaken the  2498   doublet , which leads to an underestimate of the b abundance .",
    "nlte calculations are difficult , being limited both by the incomplete understanding of the atomic physics involved and especially by the uncertainties in the uv flux values at the precise absorption wavelengths .",
    "the kiselman & carlsson ( 1996 ) study is improved over the kiselman ( 1994 ) one in that it models the effects of large numbers of lines in the background radiation field , which tend to decrease nlte effects .",
    "results of the two studies differ by approximately 0.1 dex ; present nlte calculations are necessarily less accurate than that amount .",
    "the kiselman & carlsson nlte correction for -13 is @xmath14 dex .",
    "fig .  4 shows the lte abundances as a function of [ fe / h ] from stars analyzed in the larger investigation of duncan  ( 1997 ) , with the point for -13 from the present investigation emphasized .",
    "it can be seen that there is an approximately linear relation between @xmath15 ( b@xmath3 ) and [ fe / h ] over both disk and halo metallicities , and that -13  is consistent with this relationship .",
    "a least - squares fit to all the data of fig .  4 ( allowing for errors in both coordinates ) yields a slope of 0.96@xmath160.07 and a reduced chi square , @xmath17 , of 0.71 , indicating an excellent fit .",
    "if nlte abundances are used , as shown in fig .  5 , the slope is 0.70@xmath160.07 and @xmath18 . although it is true that -13  is used to determine this line , it is important to note that this star is quite consistent with the trend defined by the other stars .",
    "inspection and @xmath17 tests confirm this .",
    "the slope of close to 1 suggesting a primary process is _ not _ expected from canonical models of cr spallation in the ism , which predict a secondary process and thus a steeper relation . in a secondary process the rate of light element production depends on the product of the abundance of target cno nuclei and the cr flux , both of which vary with time .",
    "if sne are the source of the target nuclei and the ism is well - mixed , the ism metallicity is proportional to the integral ( total ) number of sn up to a given time . if , as is commonly supposed , sne also seed the acceleration mechanism which produces crs , the cr flux is proportional to the sn rate .",
    "the result is light element abundances which vary quadratically with the metallicity of the ism , or a logarithmic slope of 2 ( prantzos  1993 ) .",
    "figs .  4 and 5",
    "show that such a slope is certainly not consistent with our data .",
    "duncan  ( 1997 ) discuss these issues in greater detail .",
    "as was discussed by duncan , lambert , and lemke ( 1992 ) , the data for the first three metal - poor stars observed for b already seemed to show a linear ( in the log ) relationship with [ fe / h ] , suggesting some primary production mechanism rather than the secondary mechanism in the ism described above .",
    "this idea has been modelled in detail by cass  ( 1995 ) , ramaty  ( 1995 and 1997 ) , lemoine  ( 1997 ) , and vangioni - flam  ( 1996 ) . in the new scenario , b and",
    "be are primarily produced by the spallation of c and o onto protons and @xmath9 particles .",
    "such a process could occur near massive star sne , where the particle flux would be very non - solar in composition ; depleted in h and he and especially enriched in o and c. vangioni - flam  find that a composition matching either winds from massive ( wolf - rayet ; wr ) stars in star - forming regions or massive star sne produce a flux of o and c which , after further acceleration , can reproduce both the magnitude and slope of b production seen in figs .  4 and 5 through collisions with protons and @xmath9 particles . as ramaty  point out , production of some additional @xmath19b by the neutrino process ( woosley  1990 ) is not ruled out , and may be favored on energetic grounds .",
    "nevertheless the bulk of the b and be would be produced from the spallation process .",
    "although the nlte correction to the b abundance of -13 is relatively large and tends to raise the b abundance above the line in fig .  5 ,",
    "two other effects not included here would tend to move it closer to the curve .",
    "one is the effect of the blending co line discussed above , which could reduce the b abundance as much as @xmath20.15 dex .",
    "the other is the fact that if the spallation producing light elements is caused by o ( and to a lesser extent c ) , @xmath15 ( b ) should be plotted against [ o / h ] rather than [ fe / h ] .",
    "as is well - known , very metal - poor stars are overabundant in o compared to fe ( moving points representing the most metal - poor stars to the right in a figure with o on the x - axis ) .",
    "duncan  ( 1997 ) make such a plot , and demonstrate that although the measurement errors in o are greater than those for fe , when all the metal - poor stars are considered together a straight line of slope 1.10@xmath160.14 fits the lte abundances , and one of slope 0.82@xmath160.10 the nlte abundances .",
    "however , oxygen abundance measurements are also surrounded by greater uncertainty than are iron measurements , and systematic errors in the oxygen abundance which depend on metallicity will affect the derived slope .",
    "the present investigation has presented an analysis of b in -13 . at a metallicity of [ fe / h]=@xmath20 ,",
    "this is the most metal - poor star ever observed for b. careful spectrum synthesis was performed to determine both the b abundance and its uncertainty .",
    "nlte corrections were also considered .",
    "we find that -13  is consistent with the straight line of slope close to 1 between log ( b ) vs.  [ fe / h ] or log ( b ) vs.  [ o / h ] found by duncan  ( 1997 ) .",
    "this suggests that the production of light elements such as b and be is directly related to the production of heavier elements .",
    "canonical models which only include spallation by the process of protons and @xmath9 particles impinging onto the general galactic ism predict a steeper relation which fails to fit all the data now available .",
    "spallation via the reverse process of energetic c and o nuclei onto protons and @xmath9 particles does much better in explaining the linear relationship observed .",
    "this reverse process was historically discarded as a minor effect ( e.g. 20% according to the calculations of walker  1993 ) since the canonical theory assumed a cr and ism composition similar to that in the solar system . a population of low - energy crs enriched in c and o and depleted in h and",
    "he can produce light elements by spallation onto the ambient medium .",
    "the metallicity of the medium would have little effect , and the process would operate the same throughout the life of the galaxy , leading to the observed slope of 1 . a model in which most light element production comes from cr spallation of c and o nuclei onto protons and @xmath9 particles in the vicinity of massive supernovae in star - forming regions fits the data well .",
    "if particle compositions are taken from calculations of either massive star sne or wr stars , spallation can reproduce both the magnitude and slope of the observed b evolution ( ramaty  1996 ) while maintaining consistency with the other light element abundances .",
    "the observations of b in -13 provide the strongest evidence of how cr spallation operated in the very early galaxy .",
    "this research was based on observations obtained with the nasa / esa _ hubble space telescope _ through the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    ", under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
