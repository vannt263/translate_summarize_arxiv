    "photon wave functions can be extracted from the usual field theory description of photodetection , and used in a way similar to the use of _ massive _ particle wave functions in describing the detection of those particles . to establish this analogy we recall some well - known results from the field theory for nonrelativistic massive particles , in which an arbitrary single - particle state @xmath0 can be written as @xmath1where each @xmath2 identifies one of a set of normalized , orthogonalized single - particle modes , @xmath3 is the vacuum state , and @xmath4 is the associated particle creation operator . for particles in free space",

    "we can now identify the single - particle wave function @xmath15 associated with the single particle state @xmath0 .",
    "the state @xmath16 , where @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the time evolution operator from @xmath20 to @xmath21 determined by the schrdinger equation , is proportional to the vacuum state ; the wave usual function @xmath22 of elementary quantum mechanics provides just that proportionality , @xmath23as can be easily confirmed .",
    "the probability of detecting the particle within @xmath24 of @xmath10 at time @xmath21 can now be written in either the particle or field theory notation ,    @xmath25    moving to two - particle states , we can construct the most general such state @xmath26 according to    @xmath27    where for later convenience we have introduced an explicit normalization constant @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , and @xmath30without loss of generality the amplitude @xmath31 can be taken to be symmetric with respect to the interchange of @xmath2 and @xmath32 for bosons , and antisymmetric with respect to that interchange for fermions . a two - time , two - particle wave function ( or bi - particle wave function ) , @xmath33 , can be introduced according to    @xmath34    it is easy to show that @xmath35 is the usual two - particle wave function at time @xmath21 , symmetric ( or antisymmetric ) with the interchange of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , if we deal with bosons ( or fermions ) . and considering detection processess activated at time @xmath21 , a standard calculation easily done at the wave function level shows that the probability of detecting one particle within @xmath24 of @xmath10 and a second particle within @xmath38 of @xmath39 is given by @xcite @xmath40    we now introduce photon wave functions in such a way that the equivalences ( [ eq : massive4],[eq : massive7 ] ) between wave functions and field theory descriptions hold when the standard glauber detection formulas are used to model photodetection probabilities . between detector activations",
    "we assume that the electromagnetic field evolves as a free radiation field .",
    "a modified version of this approach can be written down if this is not the case , but we will not do so here .",

    "the analogy of this photon wave function with the single particle wave function of a nonrelativistic particle lies in the fact that , for the single photon state , the glauber detection rate of a single ideal detector at position @xmath10 and at time @xmath51 is proportional to the first order correlation function , given by@xcite @xmath52_cf . _ ( [ eq : massive4 ] ) . for photon wave functions",
    "this is , of course , not a fundamental postulate of the theory , but is derived from the glauber detection model ; in particular , we use a form of the model where the detector is assumed isotropic .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath53 are not governed by the schrdinger equation , as in the massive particle case , but rather by maxwell s equations .",
    "the analogy with massive particles carries on to states with more than one excitation .",
    "a general two - photon state of the radiation field is described by @xmath54where @xmath28 is the normalization factor , which for photons ( or massive bosons ) can be taken to be @xmath55 ^{\\ast } f^{t}\\left ( \\lambda , \\lambda ^{\\prime } \\right ) \\right ) ^{-\\frac{1}{2}% } ,   \\label{normalizationfactor}\\]]to guarantee @xmath56 we do not choose the function @xmath57 itself to be normalized , as it is convenient to write the normalization factor separately when comparing two - photon states to corresponding single - photon states .",

    ", the analogous kind of separable spectral amplitude corresponds to a standard hartree - fock , single - determinant wave function . in many - body physics",
    "one usually characterizes such a state as free of the correlation effects  that arise due to electron - electron interactions in more sophisticated models of the full , many - electron wave function .",
    "nonetheless , there are dynamical consequences due to exchange effects even in separable states , which arise for bosons as well , and in particular photons . after considering the separable case",
    ", we generalize the discussion to address frequency entangled few - photon interference experiments that explicitly involve correlation effects .",

    "non - zero exchange terms are indicative of the indistinguishable feynman pathsor overlapping single - photon amplitudessometimes mentioned in the few - photon literature .",

    "particularity if one were to consider photons in different frequency ranges , one would find that spatially overlapping single - photon amplitudes would give rise to instantaneously non - zero exchange terms that would integrate to zero over a realistic detection time .",
    "it would be possible to observe interference between photons in different frequency ranges provided that the detection window were sufficiently short , but in practice no interference would be observed regardless of the spatial configuration of the photon wavefunctions in the region of detection . in contrast , if the photons have the same peak frequency , the spatial overlap of single - photon amplitudes in the detection region is sufficient to give rise to exchange terms that do not integrate to zero over a realistic detection time . in the subsequent discussion",
    "we assume that we are dealing with photons that have the same peak frequency , and thus where there are overlapping single - photon amplitudes in the detection region there are exchange effects in coincidence measurements .",
    "we now apply this formalism to several important two - photon interference experiments , and demonstrate that in each case the interference can be understood as single - photon wave function amplitudes giving rise to an exchange effect .",

    "two photons are incident on the 50/50 beam splitter , with one of the photons delayed in time by @xmath100 .",
    "we use a simplified notation , taking only one linear polarization associated with each port , and considering small wave packets with a narrow spread of wave vector components perpendicular to the direction identified by the port .",
    "hence a one - dimensional treatment is possible for each port .",
    "we use , for example , @xmath101 to denote a creation operator associated with a wave vector of magnitude @xmath102 and in the propagation direction relevant for port @xmath97 . in this shorthand the initial separable two - photon state , at a time just before the photon wave functions impinge on the beam - splitter , can be written as    @xmath103    where we have gone to a continuous range of wave numbers . in the full notation used in the previous section the functions @xmath104 and @xmath105 would of course be orthogonal , since the single - photon wave functions do not overlap .",
    "but in our shorthand notation we take photons @xmath106 and @xmath107 to be the same when referenced to their own ports , with only the second delayed by a time @xmath100 from the first ; thus @xmath108 .",
