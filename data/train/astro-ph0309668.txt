    "bl  lac objects are a subset of active galactic nuclei that are observationally similar to radio - loud quasars in many respects , but display systematically weaker optical line emission .",
    "bl  lac objects are also characterised by strong and variable polarisation at ultraviolet through radio wavelengths .",
    "the radio emission and much of the higher - frequency emission is almost certainly synchrotron radiation .",
    "vlbi polarization observations of radio - loud bl  lac objects have shown a tendency for the dominant magnetic ( * b * ) fields in the parsec - scale jets to be transverse to the local jet direction ( gabuzda , pushkarev , & cawthorne 2000 & references therein ) .",
    "this has often been interpreted as evidence for relativistic shocks that enhance the * b*-field component in the plane of compression , perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the shock ( laing 1980 ; hughes , aller , & aller 1989 ) .",
    "it has been suggested more recently that the transverse jet * b * fields of bl  lac objects often correspond to the toroidal * b*-field component of the jet itself ( e.g. , gabuzda 1999 , 2003 ; gabuzda & pushkarev 2002 ) . such fields would come about naturally , for example , as a result of `` winding up '' of an initial `` seed '' field with a significant longitudinal component by the rotation of the central accreting object ( e.g. ustyugova et al . 2000 ; nakamura , uchida , & hirose 2001 ) .",
    "it is therefore of interest to identify robust observational tests that can distinguish between transverse * b * fields due to a toroidal field component and due to shock compression .",
    "one possibility is to search for rotation - measure ( rm ) gradients _ across _ the jets , which should arise in the case of a toroidal * b*-field structure due to the systematic change in the line - of - sight magnetic field across the jet .",
    "asada et al .",
    "( 2002 ) claim to have detected such a gradient across the vlbi jet of 3c273 .",
    "we present and discuss here evidence for transverse rm gradients in a number of bl  lac objects .",
    "we are engaged in an ongoing study of the 34 sources in the complete sample of northern bl lacertae objects defined by khr & schmidt ( 1990 ) . as a first step in a search for transverse rm gradients in these sources , we initially concentrated on several sources that seemed to be good candidates for such studies , because their jets were rich in intensity and polarization structure and relatively well resolved in the transverse direction .",
    "the observations considered here were carried out in february 1997 ( 0820 + 225 , 1652 + 398 ( mrk501 ) , 1749 + 701 ) , april 1997 ( 1219 + 285 , 1308 + 326 , 1803 + 784 ) , and may 2001 ( 1749 + 701 , 1823 + 568 ) at 6 , 4 & 2  cm using the nrao very long baseline array . the total intensity ( @xmath0 ) and linear polarization ( @xmath1 ) calibration and imaging",
    "were done in aips using standard techniques .",
    "we then made 2 , 4 and 6-cm matched - resolution ( corresponding to the 6-cm beam ) images of the stokes parameters @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 for each of the sources .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 images were combined to make maps of the polarized flux and polarization position angle , @xmath4 . after subtracting the rotation corresponding to the known integrated ( assumed to be largely galactic ) rotation measures ( pushkarev 1999 ) at each wavelength , the @xmath4 maps at each of the three wavelengths were then used to derive the rm distributions using the aips task rm .",
    "we included 0820 + 225 in this initial study because its curved jet is well resolved and very rich in @xmath0 and @xmath1 structure , extending tens of milliarcseconds from the core ( gabuzda , pushkarev , & garnich 2001 ) .",
    "although a comparison of the 4-cm and 6-cm polarization angles indicates the presence of a transverse rm gradient beyond the westward bend of the jet ( fig .  1 ) , we did not attempt to obtain a three - wavelength rm map for this source , since the 2-cm emission was weak beyond the innermost jet .",
    "we found reasonable to good evidence for transverse rm gradients in all the remaining sources except for 1308 + 326 .",
    "2 shows our rm map of 1652 + 398 as an example , together with plots of the observed polarization position angles @xmath4 as functions of the square of the observing wavelength , @xmath5 , for the two opposite sides and the center of the vlbi jet .",
    "these plots show that the @xmath4 values display the linear dependence on @xmath5 expected for faraday rotation .",
    "of the seven sources investigated , we found clear systematic rm gradients transverse to the vlbi jets in 1652 + 398 and 1823 + 568 , with @xmath5 laws being obeyed well in both cases .",
    "some indications of transverse rm gradients were also found in 1219 + 285 and 1749 + 701 .",
    "a comparison of the 4  cm and 6  cm polarization - angle distributions for 0820 + 225 shows a clear transverse gradient in the rm distribution , but we were not able to verify this on the basis of data obtained at more than two wavelengths .",
    "finally , although our own rm map of 1803 + 784 did not show convincing evidence for transverse rm gradients , the rm map of this source recently presented by zavala & taylor ( 2003 ) , based on six wavelengths in the vlba 2  cm and 4  cm bands , clearly shows a transverse rm gradient about 4  mas from the vlbi core .",
    "thus , we consider this initial search for transverse rm gradients to have been successful .",
    "it is natural to interpret the observed transverse rm gradients as reflecting the presence of a toroidal or helical * b * field associated with these vlbi jets . in this case ,",
    "the origin of the gradients is the systematic change in the line - of - sight * b * field component across the jet .",
    "the fact that we detected transverse rm gradients in several of the sources considered in this initial study suggests that they may be common in bl  lac objects .",
    "a helical * b*-field structure could come about in a natural way as a consequence of `` winding up '' of a seed field threading the central accretion disk by the joint action of the rotation of the accretion disk and the jet outflow ( e.g. , ustyugova et al .",
    "2000 ; nakamura , uchida , & hirose 2001 ) .",
    "it is intriguing that a * b * field with a predominant toroidal component would also come about if a non - zero current flows along the jet ( e.g. , istomin & pariev 1996 ) .",
    "indeed , one can turn the problem around , and assert that the presence of a substantial toroidal * b*-field component requires that there be a non - zero current in the jet !    in the simplest case when we are viewing a toroidal or helical *",
    "b * field `` from the side '' ( i.e. , at @xmath6 to the jet axis ) in the rest frame of the source and the distribution of thermal electrons is approximately uniform , we would expect to observe a rotation measure close to zero along the jet axis ( since the line - of - sight * b*-field component there is close to zero ) and rms of opposite sign on either side of the axis .",
    "this is roughly the behavior shown by the rm distribution in fig .  2 , where the rm is positive on the southwestern side of the jet and negative on the northeastern side of the jet . when the * b * field is viewed at some other angle to the jet axis , there will still be a systematic gradient in the rm across the jet , however the gradient `` peak '' will be shifted , and the rm will not necessarily pass through zero .",
    "note that viewing the jet at @xmath6 to its axis in the rest frame of the _ jet _ is equivalent to viewing the jet at an angle of @xmath7 in the rest frame of the _ observer _ , where @xmath8 is the lorentz factor of the bulk motion of the jet flow .",
    "thus , since we know the jets of agn such as bl lac objects make relatively small angles to the line of sight , of order @xmath9 , it may be that we should expect to see such relatively symmetrical transverse rm distributions in these sources fairly often .",
    "the results of our initial search for rotation - measure gradients transverse to the vlbi jets of bl lac objects have yielded good evidence for such gradients in several sources .",
    "this lends further support to earlier arguments that the `` transverse '' * b * fields that characterize the jets of these objects are associated with toroidal or helical structure of the intrinsic jet * b * fields .",
    "this underlines the view of these jets as fundamentally electromagnetic structures , and suggests that they may well carry non - zero currents .",
    "the occurrence of faraday rotation requires both a non - zero line - of - sight * b*-field component and the presence of free electrons in the medium through which the linearly polarized radiation propagates .",
    "this complicates searches for systematic behavior of the rm distribution across jet structures , since the density of free electrons is likely to drop off with distance from the core ( e.g. , taylor 1998 , 2000 ; reynolds , cawthorne , & gabuzda 2001 ; gabuzda & chernetskii 2003 ) .",
    "higher resolution can be attained by moving toward observations at shorter wavelengths , but such observations will be less sensitive to faraday rotation , since the rotation measure increases in proportion to @xmath5 .",
    "it appears that the use of multiple wavelengths within the vlba 2  cm , 4  cm and 6  cm bands represents the best available approach for such studies in terms of providing both good resolution and good sensitivity to faraday rotation .",
    "we have recently acquired such data for 0820 + 225 , 1219 + 285 , 1652 + 398 , 1749 + 701 , and 1803 + 784 in order to confirm the presence of transverse rm gradients across their vlbi jets and to study the properties of these gradients in more detail ."
