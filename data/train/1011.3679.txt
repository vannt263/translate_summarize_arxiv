    "the first - order duffin - kemmer - petiau ( dkp ) formalism @xcite-@xcite describes spin-0 and spin-1 particles and has been used to analyze relativistic interactions of spin-0 and spin-1 hadrons with nuclei as an alternative to their conventional second - order klein - gordon and proca counterparts .",
    "the onus of equivalence between the formalisms represented an objection to the dkp theory for a long time and only recently it was shown that they yield the same results in the case of minimally coupled vector interactions , on the condition that one correctly interprets the components of the dkp spinor @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the equivalence between the dkp and the proca formalisms has already a precedent @xcite .",
    "the equivalence does not maintain if one considers partially conserved currents @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dkp formalism enjoys a richness of couplings not capable of being expressed in the klein - gordon and proca theories .",
    "nonminimal vector potentials , added by other kinds of lorentz structures , have already been used successfully in a phenomenological context for describing the scattering of mesons by nuclei @xcite-@xcite .",
    "nonminimal vector coupling with a quadratic potential @xcite , with a linear potential @xcite , and mixed space and time components with a step potential @xcite-@xcite and a linear potential @xcite have been explored in the literature .",

    "@xcite it was shown that when the space component of the coupling is stronger than its time component the linear potential , a sort of vector dkp oscillator , can be used as a model for confining bosons .",
    "the cusp potential in the form @xmath0 ( screened coulomb potential in a two - dimensional space - time world ) has been analyzed and its analytical solutions have been found for the dirac equation with vector @xcite-@xcite , scalar @xcite and pseudoscalar asc couplings , and for the klein - gordon equation with vector @xcite-@xcite and scalar @xcite couplings , and a mixed scalar - vector coupling @xcite . as has been emphasized in refs . @xcite and kag2",
    ", the solutions of relativistic equations with this sort of potential may find applications in the study of pionic atoms , doped mott insulators , doped semiconductors , interaction between ions , quantum dots surrounded by a dielectric or a conducting medium , protein structures , etc .",
    "the bound states for the klein - gordon equation with a minimal vector coupling differ radically from those ones for the dirac equation . for an enough deep and narrow potential the klein - gordon equation exhibits the phenomenon called schiff - snyder - weinberg effect ( sswe ) @xcite .",
    "such an effect manifests by additional antiparticle bound states in a potential attractive only for particles . for critical depths , the particle and antiparticle energy levels coalesce and there unveils a new channel for the pair production .",
    "popov pop argued that the sswe is inherent to short - range interactions and should not be expected for large - range potentials .",
    "nevertheless , klein and rafelski @xcite used a purported sswe in a coulomb potential for speculating about the bose condensation and the stability of extremely high atomic number nuclei and , right away , were severely criticized @xcite . as a matter of fact , the investigation of the bound - state solutions of the klein - gordon equation with different functional forms for the potential validates popov s conjecture @xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present article is to report on the properties of the dkp theory with time components of minimal and nonminimal vector cusp potentials for spin-0 and spin-1 bosons in a unified way .",
    "this sort of mixing , beyond its potential physical applications , shows to be a powerful tool to obtain a deeper insight about the nature of the dkp equation and its solutions as far as it explores the differences between minimal and nonminimal couplings .",
    "the problem is mapped into an exactly solvable sturm - liouville problem of a schrdinger - like equation with an effective symmetric morse - like potential , or an effective cusp potential in the particular circumstance of a pure minimal coupling .",

    "the dkp equation can be written as@xmath15and @xmath16 satisfies the equation @xcite@xmath17thus , if @xmath18 is hermitian with respect to @xmath19 then the four - current will be conserved .",
    "the more general potential matrix @xmath18 is written in terms of 25 ( 100 ) linearly independent matrices pertinent to the five(ten)-dimensional irreducible representation associated to the scalar ( vector ) sector and can be written in terms of well - defined lorentz structures . for the spin-0 sector",

    "in addition , in view of ( [ norm ] ) the spinors @xmath42 and @xmath43 are said to be orthonormal if@xmath44    the charge - conjugation operation changes the sign of the minimal interaction potential ,  i.e. _ _  _ _ changes the sign of  @xmath45 .",

    "( [ orto1 ] ) is in agreement with the orthonormalization formula for the klein - gordon theory in the presence of a minimally coupled potential @xcite .",

    "in this representation @xmath84 , i.e. @xmath21 projects out the four upper components of the dkp spinor . with the spinor written as @xmath85 , and partitioned as@xmath86@xmath87@xmath88the one - dimensional time - independent dkp equation with time - like components of vector potentials",
    "can be expressed as @xmath89@xmath90@xmath91where @xmath92 is again given by ( [ k ] ) .",
    "now the components of the four - current are@xmath93@xmath94and the orthonormalization expression ( [ orto8 ] ) takes the form@xmath95just as for scalar bosons , @xmath96 for @xmath73 and @xmath97 does not appear in the current .",
    "similarly , @xmath97 do not manifest explicitly in the orthonormalization formula .",
    "comparison between the two sets of formulas for the spin-0 and spin-1 sectors of the dkp theory evidences that vector bosons and scalar bosons behave in a similar way .",
    "now we are in a position to use the dkp equation with specific forms for vector interactions .",
    "let us focus our attention on time components of minimal and nonminimal vector potentials in the form of a cusp potential @xmath98with @xmath99where the coupling constants , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , are dimensionless real parameters and @xmath102 , related to the range of the interaction , is a positive parameter . in this case the first equations of ( [ dkp4 ] ) and ( [ spin1-ti ] ) transmutes into@xmath103where @xmath104 is equal to @xmath105 for the scalar sector , and to @xmath106 for the vector sector",
    ", with@xmath107 @xmath108and @xmath109    therefore , one has to search for bounded solutions in an effective symmetric morse - like potential for @xmath110 , or in a cusp potential for the case of a pure nonminimal vector potential ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "note carefully that the dkp equation can furnish a discrete spectrum only if@xmath112this is so because the effective potential approaches zero as @xmath113 . only in this circumstance",
    "the effective potential presents a potential - well structure permitting bounded solutions in the range @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the energies in the range @xmath116 correspond to the continuum . also note that the spectrum changes sign under the transformation @xmath117 , but it remains invariant under @xmath118 .",
    "the dkp energies are obtained by inserting the effective eigenvalues into ( [ sc2 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath110 the effective potential depends on the energy and the single - well potential is deeper and larger for one sign of energy than for the other one . when @xmath119 , for instance , the single - well potential is deeper and larger for positive energies than that one for negative energies",
    "thus , the capacity to hold bound states depends on the sign of the energy and one might expect that the number of positive - energy levels is greater than the number of negative - energy levels . by the way , the positive ( negative ) energy solutions are not to be promptly identified with the solutions for particles ( antiparticles ) . rather , whether it is positive or negative , an energy can be unambiguously identified with a bounded solution for a particle ( antiparticle ) only by observing if the energy level emerges from the upper ( lower ) continuum . when @xmath111 , though , the effective cusp potential allows energy levels symmetric about @xmath120 .",
    "the easiness with which the nonminimal vector potential well has bound states for both signs of @xmath33 is due to the fact that this kind of potential couples equally to particles and antiparticles , as has already been anticipated by the charge - conjugation properties . condition ( [ sc4 ] ) can also be expressed as @xmath121this inequality can be used to achieve the constraint on the potential parameters as well as the signs of @xmath33 . for @xmath119",
    "all positive values of @xmath33 are allowed but negative values are allowed only if @xmath122 . from this last formula , one can see that only if @xmath123energy levels with @xmath124 will be allowed .",
    "when @xmath111 , though , the spectrum can acquiesce both signs for the energies , regardless the values of @xmath33 , @xmath101 and @xmath125 . in this qualitative context , there is no hint or indication whether popov s conjecture is valid .",
    "nevertheless , since the energy levels for antiparticles must emerge from the lower continuum one can conclude that the sswe is a strong - field phenomenon inasmuch as @xmath126 requires @xmath127 in the case of a pure minimal coupling attractive for particles in a nonrelativistic scheme .",
    "now we move to consider a quantitative treatment of bound - state solutions .",
    "since the effective potential is even under @xmath128 , @xmath104 can be expressed as a function of definite parity .",
    "thus , we can concentrate our attention on the positive half - line and impose boundary conditions on @xmath104 and @xmath129 at @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "in addition to @xmath132 in order to ensure normalizability of the dkp spinor , the boundary conditions can be met in two distinct ways : the even function obeys the homogeneous neumann condition at the origin ( @xmath133 ) whereas the odd function obeys the homogeneous dirichlet condition ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "defining the dimensionless quantities @xmath135one obtains@xmath136    let us define @xmath137 so that @xmath138 obeys the whittaker equation @xcite : @xmath139whose solution regular at @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) , with    @xmath142    is written as @xmath143 . here",
    "@xmath144 is a normalization constant and @xmath145 is the regular confluent hypergeometric function ( kummer s function)@xmath146where @xmath147 is the gamma function .",
    "thus , @xmath148    from eq . ( [ sc10 ] ) one can see now that the boundary conditions at @xmath130 ( @xmath149 ) imply into@xmath150since the dkp energies are dependent on @xmath151 and @xmath152 via @xmath153 and @xmath154 , it follows that eq .",
    "( [ sc11 ] ) is a quantization condition .",
    "the allowed values for the parameters @xmath151 and @xmath152 , and @xmath33 as an immediate consequence , are determined by solving eq .",
    "( [ sc11 ] ) . due to the presence of @xmath153 in the definition of @xmath151",
    "one can expect an asymmetry in the spectrum so that the presence of each sign of energy depends , of course , on the relative strength between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "for the case of a pure nonminimal vector potential ( @xmath111 ) , though , one has @xmath155  and the negative- and positive - energy levels are disposed symmetrically about @xmath156 , as commented before , and there are as many positive - energy levels as negative ones .",
    "this particular case allows a simpler mathematical treatment as can be seen in appendix a. although the quantization condition has no closed form expressions in terms of simpler functions , the exact computation of the allowed eigenenergies can be done easily with a root - finding procedure of a symbolic algebra program . proceeding in this way , the whole bound - state spectrum is found .",
    "the dkp energies are plotted in figure 1 , 2 and 3 for the lowest bound - state solutions as a function of @xmath125 for two different values of @xmath102 ( @xmath157 is the compton wavelength ) .",
    "the energies for @xmath158 and @xmath159 can be obtained by using the charge - symmetries mentioned before , viz .",
    "the spectrum is invariant  under @xmath160 , and @xmath53 when @xmath117 .",
    "for large @xmath102 and small @xmath125 , the spectrum consists of a finite set of energy levels of alternate parities and the energy level corresponding to the ground - state solution ( @xmath104 even ) of particles ( for @xmath119 ) always makes its appearance , as it happens in a nonrelativistic framework .",
    "surprisingly , as @xmath125 increases the number of bound - state solutions can decrease and one might find an odd - parity ground - state solution , or no solution at all . indeed , the situation is more complicated and the existing correlation between the number of bound - state solutions and the depth of the effective potential well in the nonrelativistic theory does not verify for a strong potential . in the case of a pure minimal coupling , as illustrated in figure 1 , particle levels appear in the spectrum and those levels tend to sink at the continuum of negative energies for large @xmath102 . as @xmath102 decreases ,",
    "though , a new branch of solutions corresponding to antiparticle levels begin to emerge from the continuum of negative energies and coalesce with the particle levels .",
    "this is the signature of the sswe . in figure 2",
    "one can see the tendency of the spectrum to be symmetrical about @xmath156 . in figure 3 , for the case of a pure nonminimal coupling , that symmetry shows itself perfect .",
    "in summary , we have succeed in the proposal of searching the solution for a cusp potential with the dkp equation .",
    "an opportunity was given to analyze some aspects of the dkp equation which would not be feasibly only with the cases already approached in the literature .",
    "thus , the use of the mixing of minimal and nonminimal vector lorentz structures for other kinds of potentials , primarily because nonminimal vector couplings have no counterpart in the klein - gordon and proca theories , may lead to a better understanding of the dkp equation and its solutions . in the case of a pure minimal coupling ( @xmath161 ) the dkp equation reduces to the klein - gordon and proca equations and our results",
    "are in accordance with those found in the literature for the klein - gordon case ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the popov conjecture about the sswe is supported as a short - range phenomenon for spin-0 particles as well as for spin-1 particles .",
    "finally , one very important point to note is that the matrix potential @xmath162a_{\\mu } ^{\\left ( 2\\right ) } $ ] in ( [ dkp2 ] ) leads to a conserved four - current but the same does not happen if instead of the matrix @xmath27 $ ] one uses either @xmath163 or @xmath164 , as in @xcite-@xcite , even though the linear forms constructed from those matrices behave as true lorentz vectors .        in the particular case of a pure nonminimal vector potential",
    "one can take advantage of the relation expressing the bessel function of the first kind and order @xmath154 in terms of the hypergeometric function @xcite @xmath165to write @xmath166where @xmath167 is a normalization constant and @xmath168 .",
    "the boundary conditions at @xmath130 ( @xmath169 ) imply that @xmath170    the oscillatory character of the bessel function and the finite range for @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) imply that there is a finite number of discrete dkp energies .",
    "the roots of @xmath173 and @xmath174 are listed in tables of bessel functions only for a few special values of @xmath175 .",
    "a bit of time and effort can be saved in the numerical calculation of the roots of @xmath174 if one uses the recurrence relation @xmath176 , in such a manner that the quantization condition for even states translates into @xmath177 ."
