    "in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe , the hierarchical structure formation scenario posits that large galaxies , such as the milky way and the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) , have enlarged through multiple mergers with smaller galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the spheroidal component of galaxies is correlated with the mass of their central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "the magorrian relation @xcite implies that galaxies coevolve with their central smbhs .",
    "however , the coevolution process of galaxies and smbhs is largely unknown . in the hierarchical structure formation scenario ,",
    "galaxies collide and merge with other galaxies and subsequently with less massive galaxies , causing their central smbhs to drift within the halo region of their host galaxy .",
    "in other words , smbhs wander in the halo of their host galaxy after galaxy merging events and finally sink toward the central region of the host galaxy under dynamical friction .",
    "therefore , smbhs can be either centralized in their host galaxy , as in active galactic nuclei , or reside outside of the nucleus @xcite , although evidence of the latter class of smbhs is currently lacking .",
    "the search for wandering smbh has recently attracted great interest @xcite . in this study , we theoretically investigate the probable positions of such smbhs .",
    "cosmological @xmath1-body simulations of the hierarchical structure formation have revealed a wealth of merger remnants around host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to verify theoretical predictions from the cdm scenario , and therefore test the current cosmology ,",

    "a giant stellar stream has been discovered in the southern region of the halo of m31 @xcite .",
    "further photometric and spectroscopic observations of the spatial and radial velocity distributions of red giant stars , as well as the metallicity distribution , have revealed other substructures near m31 @xcite .",
    "the motions of test particles under the gravitational potential of m31 have been calculated @xcite , and the interaction between the progenitor of the stream and m31 has been investigated in @xmath1-body simulations @xcite .",
    "these studies suggest that the stream , the northeast shell , and the west shell constitute tidal debris formed during recent pericentric passages of a radially - accreting satellite .",
    "these models reproduce the observed features and successfully restrain the orbit and the properties of the progenitor .    from the magorrian relation ,",
    "a progenitor dwarf galaxy is expected to be occupied by an smbh of mass @xmath4 about @xmath0 times the mass of the spheroidal component of its host galaxy @xmath5 @xcite . a similar relation between @xmath4 and the velocity dispersion @xmath6 of the host galaxy , called the @xmath7 relation ,",
    "has been confirmed down to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the relation between smbhs and their host galaxies holds down to @xmath9 .",
    "since the dynamical mass of the progenitor is estimated to be of order @xmath10 @xcite , the progenitor likely harbored an smbh of mass up to @xmath11 ; assuming that the progenitor consisted solely of a spheroidal stellar component .",
    "thus , an smbh should currently be wandering among the merger remnants .",
    "finding such an smbh will help to elucidate how smbhs coevolve with galaxies .",
    "this study uses @xmath1-body simulations to predict the current likely positions of the smbh and thereby guide future observational detections .    using @xmath1-body simulations ,",
    "we first constrain the infalling orbit of the progenitor satellite galaxy (  [ section : lrs ] ) . in  [ section : hrs ] , we investigate the current plausible position of the expected smbh in the m31 halo and derive an observational field for future observations .",
    "the physical relationships between this merger event and the satellite galaxy distribution around m31 is discussed in  [ section : discussion ] .",
    "the study is summarized in  [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , low - resolution @xmath1-body simulations are conducted over a wide parameter range to restrict the infalling orbit of the progenitor satellite galaxy . following this investigation ,",
    "@xmath1-body simulations are conducted at higher resolution in  [ section : hrs ] .",
    "the numerical modeling and analysis are discussed in  [ subsec : lrs : modeling ] and  [ subsec : lrs : analysis ] , and simulation results are presented in  [ subsec : lrs : result ] .    before detailing our numerical modeling technique ,",
    "we emphasize how it differs from that of an earlier parameter study focused on the infalling orbit of the satellite @xcite .",
    "@xcite sought the parameter set that best reproduced the observed structures .",
    "they were interested in the physical properties of m31 and its progenitor satellite .",
    "consequently , they focused on a very narrow region of parameter space around the best - fit configuration .",
    "by contrast , we seek to restrict the region in which an smbh of unknown location wanders around the m31 halo .",
    "this requires a wider and more systematic exploration of the parameter phase space to identify all plausible parameter ranges .",
    "our systematic parameter study over a wide parameter region complements the study of @xcite .",
    "we simulate an accreting satellite dwarf galaxy interacting with m31 using @xmath1-body simulations , concentrating on the infalling orbit of the progenitor dwarf galaxy .",
    "we assume an axisymmetric fixed potential model composed of a hernquist bulge @xcite , an exponential disk , and an nfw halo @xcite for m31 @xcite .",
    "this assumption of the fixed potential model is appropriate because the dynamical response of m31 s disk to progenitor collision is negligible if the dynamical mass of the progenitor is below @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "our numerical simulations are performed in a cartesian coordinate system @xmath13 whose origin represents the center of m31 . the @xmath14 axis is directed along our line - of - sight , and the @xmath15 and @xmath16 axes point east and north on the sky plane , respectively .",
    "this coordinate system has been commonly adopted in earlier studies of m31 . the distance from earth to m31",
    "is assumed as 780 kpc @xcite ; thus , @xmath17 corresponds to a physical scale of 13.6 kpc .",
    "the heliocentric velocity of m31 toward the line - of - sight , east and south on the sky plane is assumed as @xmath18 km s@xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 km s@xmath19 and @xmath21 km s@xmath19 @xcite , respectively .    by restricting the area in which the smbh exists",
    ", this study aims to determine the observational field for future observational detections .",
    "the greatest contributor to the uncertainty in the current smbh position is uncertainty of the infalling orbit of the progenitor dwarf galaxy .",
    "therefore , we should perform a large parameter study in the six - dimensional phase space to constrain the orbit of the infalling satellite to that of the observed structures .",
    "since a six - dimensional parameter space is excessively large for an exhaustive search , even by recent high - performance computer architectures , we reduce the number of dimensions as follows .",
    "first , to ensure that the satellite interacts with m31 , we fix the initial distance of the infalling satellite as @xmath22 kpc from the center of m31 ( corresponding to the scale radius of a dark matter halo ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , we model m31 as an axisymmetric system . imposing these conditions ,",
    "the parameter space is reduced to four dimensions ( the altitude of the initial position and the initial velocity vector ) , but remains very large .",
    "to realize a sufficiently wide parameter space , the parameter sets are distributed on a relatively coarse grid defined in m31-centric spherical coordinates . since m31 is axisymmetric , the azimuthal angle ( around the rotation axis of the m31 disk ) of the initial satellite position is simply related to the observational angle .",
    "instead of performing multiple @xmath1-body simulations at different azimuthal angles , we `` observe '' snapshots of @xmath1-body simulations by rotating around the axis with a @xmath23@xmath23 bin width . to determine the altitude of the initial position",
    ", the northern hemisphere of m31 is covered in @xmath24 increments .",
    "we focus on a merger occurring immediately prior to the giant stellar stream in the southern hemisphere ; thus , we consider the initial orbital position to lie in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the possibility that the satellite entered from the opposite side is discussed in  [ section : discussion ] .",
    "the grid width of the infalling velocity of the satellite in the radial direction is @xmath213 km s@xmath19 .",
    "two characteristic velocities are @xmath25 and @xmath26 km",
    "s@xmath19 , respectively , specifying the escape velocity at the initial position ( @xmath22 kpc from the center of m31 ) , and the velocity required to set the apoapsis of the satellite at @xmath27 kpc . since the giant stellar stream extends beyond 100 kpc from the center of m31 @xcite , the infalling velocity of the satellite should exceed @xmath26 km s@xmath19 . for a fair evaluation of other possibilities , we also test models in which the infalling radial velocity exceeds @xmath25 km s@xmath19 and is slower than @xmath26 km s@xmath19 .",
    "the tangential velocity vector at the initial position is described by two parameters specifying its norm and direction .",
    "the former parameter ( the speed of the tangential velocity ) is varied as a ratio of the radial velocity from 0 to 0.47 in @xmath28 increments . the latter parameter ( direction of the tangential velocity ) covers @xmath29 divided into 32 bins .    in this parameter survey ,",
    "the infalling satellite contains @xmath30 particles and the gravitational softening length is set as 50 pc .",
    "the progenitor is assumed as a king sphere with total mass @xmath31 , concentration @xmath32 , and tidal radius @xmath33 kpc , since this model best matches the progenitor dwarf galaxy when the progenitor follows fardal s orbit @xcite .",
    "the numerical scheme adopts a second - order leapfrog integrator and a shared fixed time step .    to sweep such a wide parameter space",
    ", we perform a vast parameter survey utilizing a graphics processing unit ( gpu ) cluster , namely , ha - pacs at the university of tsukuba . for this purpose , a highly optimized @xmath1-body simulation code",

    "this criterion eliminates the event of the undiscovered former satellite surviving the collision with m31 .",
    "the position of the surface density peak of the stellar stream matches that of the observed peak : the density of the simulated stream must peak within a fan - like region of angular width @xmath37 , containing the observation field of the giant stellar stream @xcite .",
    "this condition is similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the two stellar shells adequately agree with the observed shapes . to quantify how precisely each run",

    "successful parameter sets must satisfy @xmath41 ( @xmath42% confidence level according to * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the sharpness of the edge of the two stellar shells is consistent with the observations .",
    "we stipulate that the stellar density inside the edge is more than two times the stellar density outside the edge .",

    ", we `` observe '' the numerical results imposing a limiting magnitude of @xmath52 ( the detection limit of the wide field camera on the isaac newton telescope ; * ? ? ?",
    "the method for detecting the edge of the stellar shell while `` observing '' snapshots is optimized to capture all edge - like features .",
    "all density peaks and valleys along a radial direction on the sky plane are assigned as edge candidates , and the candidate nearest to the observed edge is tagged as the `` observed '' edge in the snapshots . if we know the actual mass - to - light ratio of the progenitor satellite galaxy , then the easiest and most plausible way to determine the shell edges is to combine the mass - to - light ratio with the instrument detection limit .",
    "this simple method , however , would miss some edge signatures if the mass - to - light ratio is assumed greater ( i.e. the satellite is assumed fainter ) than the actual ratio .",
    "to avoid this situation , we detect the edge of the shells by the abovementioned method .",
    "since only a small number of the @xmath1-body particles are used , spurious density peaks and valleys are introduced by poisson noise , which artificially decreases the reduced @xmath38 value . later",

    "we compare the above `` observing '' criteria with those of earlier studies . in all of the earlier studies , the structures formed after a galactic merger had reproduced ( all or some of ) the observed global shapes [ minor merger scenarios by @xcite , and major merger scenario by @xcite ] .",

    "periapsis @xmath55 ( contour map of solid curves ) and @xmath56 ( contour map of dashed curves ) were evaluated by test - particle calculation under a fixed potential in the spherical components of m31 ( bulge and halo ) .",
    "the crossing time is defined as the time required to pass the region @xmath57 at the first pericentric passage , where @xmath58 is the critical radius from the center of m31 . at @xmath58 , the core radius of the satellite corresponds to its hill radius against the m31 bulge . within this radius , the tidal force exerted by m31 largely governs the time evolution of the satellite . at the core radius of the satellite ,",

    "one of the most important results in this study is that a maximum infall velocity of the progenitor satellite galaxy exists ( @xmath2480 km s@xmath19 ) .",
    "since the escape velocity is 550 km s@xmath19 ( thick solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : survey.result ] ) , the observed structures can only be formed by an m31-bound satellite galaxy .",
    "the collision that occurred several hundred megayears ago should have been the first collision of the infalling satellite , because the strong tidal field exerted by the bulge of m31 will destroy the satellite in a single passage .",

    "thus , dynamical friction encountered during a few crossings exerts no influence on the motion of the smbh in this study .",
    "consequently , our @xmath1-body simulations , which ignore dynamical friction , are sufficiently realistic to predict the current position of the smbh .    in the next place ,",
    "smbh shifts from its initial position by gravitational brownian motion , a random walk in momentum space perturbed by gravitational encounters with nearby stars @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "the expected velocity dispersion of the smbh is @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the effective stellar mass and the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of nearby stars in the satellite galaxy , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the velocity dispersion of the satellite galaxy is @xmath134 km s@xmath19 at the center , and @xmath135 km s@xmath19 at the core radius .",
    "this value is negligibly small , and will not visibly alter the smbh orbit ; hence , we conclude that excluding these effects does not alter our predictions of the current smbh position .      in the recent observational studies of the satellite galaxy distribution around m31 , @xcite and @xcite",
    "concluded that 15 of the satellite galaxies are arranged in a disk - like structure .",
    "figure  [ fig : survey.hammer ] distinguishes the satellite galaxies forming a vast thin disk around m31 @xcite from other satellite galaxies @xcite , which are randomly scattered .",
    "as noted by @xcite and @xcite , approximately half of the m31 satellite galaxies locate near a disk plane .",
    "assuming that m31 was formed by a gas - rich major merger event , and given the observed giant stellar stream @xcite , @xcite and @xcite proposed that the major merger gave rise to the observed satellite distribution .",
    "however , the origin of the satellite distribution remains an open question .",
    "figure  [ fig : survey.hammer ] reveals a surprising result : part of the possible orbit region overlaps the disk plane of the satellite galaxies around m31 .",
    "this infers a close connection between the formation process of the giant stellar stream and the disk plane of the satellite galaxies . @xcite",
    "considered that several hundred megayears ago is very recent to admit first - time collision between a bound satellite galaxy and its host galaxy . however",
    ", this unnatural situation can be understood from the disk - like distribution of satellite galaxies .",
    "if the satellites are distributed in this way , the probability of satellite - satellite interactions is higher than when the satellites are randomly distributed , since the number density of satellite galaxies is greater in a disk geometry .",
    "a satellite galaxy within the disk plane can lose most of its angular momentum through inter - satellite interactions .",
    "once this occurs , the satellite is expected to follow a highly radial infall orbit toward m31 , generating the observed structures such as the giant stellar stream . in future studies",
    ", we will evaluate the cross - section of these interactions and discuss the possibility of this working hypothesis .",
    "the remarkable correspondence between the orbit and the disk plane becomes apparent when the orbit of an smbh particle ( smbh i d 3 in tab .",
    "[ tab : mbh ] ) is superimposed on the galaxy distribution ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : survey.hammer ] ) .",
    "two of the five successful orbits listed in table  [ tab : mbh ] ( smbh i d 2 and 3 ) lie on the disk plane .",
    "therefore , if future observations establish that the smbh is wandering in the m31 halo , we will be equipped with highly suggestive clues regarding the formation and evolutionary history of the m31 halo .",
    "these data will enable connection of the observed stellar structures , and the current and ancient distributions of satellite galaxies .",
    "furthermore , since two of the smbh orbits coincide with the disk plane of the satellite galaxies , more wandering smbhs might reside in the m31 halo .",
    "figure  [ fig : survey.hammer ] suggests that an smbh initially moving along the disk plane remains on the plane .",
    "the observed disk - like satellite distribution is expected to trigger satellite - m31 interactions by extracting orbital angular momentum via unknown process , for example , satellite - satellite interactions .",
    "consequently , remnants of ancient merger events should be concentrated in the halo region near the disk plane of the satellites .",
    "the higher merger rate suggests that smbhs will be similarly concentrated in this field of the halo .",
    "therefore , a group of wandering smbhs might locate along the disk plane formed by the satellite galaxies .      here , the study by @xcite is worthy of note .",
    "they concluded that a 10 kpc ring observed in the m31 disk is a remnant of an offset merger .",
    "the ring structure of radius @xmath210 kpc has been extensively reported in infrared or h@xmath136 images @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the ring formed at an offset distance of 1.4 kpc from the center of m31 , close to @xmath55 determined in this study ( see  [ subsec : lrs : result ] ) .",
    "this correspondence between the two studies suggests that the 10 kpc ring is another fossil record of the minor merger investigated in this study .",
    "@xcite discovered an overdense region of effective radius @xmath137 , at @xmath138 .",
    "our results suggest that the clump found by @xcite may be related to the giant stellar stream .",
    "to check the physical connection between the former minor merger event and the clump , the clump must be discriminated from the m31 disk component in phase space , based on spectroscopic observations .",
    "@xcite similarly compared the `` location of the progenitor s central material '' with the clump position ; however , their results were inconclusive because their stellar particles were widely spaced . in fardal",
    "et al.s study , the particles were initially placed in the central region of the progenitor , and the very central region was resolved by a small number of @xmath1-body particles , leading to a sparse wider distribution . @xcite investigated a model of m31 colliding with a dwarf spiral galaxy comprising a stellar bulge , disk , and dark matter halo .",
    "they reported that part of the bulge component of the progenitor survived the collision .",
    "the surviving part is located close to the current position of the wandering smbh identified in this study .",
    "this correspondence strongly suggests that the current smbh position is independent of the morphology of the progenitor satellite galaxy .",
    "since the smbh likely occupies the m31 halo , the smbh of the progenitor should not be considered as an origin of multiple nuclei in m31 * @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since the smbh locates closer to the milky way than the m31 disk , the m31 disk will not disturb future observational attempts to detect the smbh .",
    "if the wandering smbh is experimentally verified in the near future , our understanding of how smbhs coevolve with their host galaxies will be greatly enhanced .",
    "the candidate fields determined in this study will complement future observations .",
    "since the mass of the smbh is close to the low - mass end of the @xmath7 relation , observational discovery of the smbh will provide information on the low - mass end of the smbh - host galaxy associations .",
    "we investigated an smbh in an ancient satellite galaxy , whose current position is consistent with the observed structures in the m31 halo .",
    "the infalling orbit of the satellite was first established by conducting numerous low - resolution parameter trials on a high performance gpu cluster .",
    "these preliminary investigations reduced the possible parameter space for the orbit to a manageable size .",
    "next , the orbital evolution of the smbh was directly calculated in high - resolution @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "the hermitage of the smbh was localized to the northeast stellar shell over an area of @xmath108 .",
    "the observational field @xmath106 was sufficiently wide to contain all possible positions of the wandering smbh .",
    "furthermore , we found signatures of the relationships between this particular minor merger and the recently identified thin disk plane formed by m31 s satellite galaxies",
    ". this discovery may assist in identifying a group of wandering smbhs in the halo of m31 .",
    "our forthcoming paper will present a feasibility study on detecting the wandering smbhs @xcite .",
    "we thank a. tanikawa for useful suggestion about @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed with ha - pacs at the center for computational sciences , university of tsukuba .",
