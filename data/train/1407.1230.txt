    "`` quantum simulation with ultra cold atoms '' @xcite is a much discussed and investigated topic nowadays .",
    "such quantum simulation implies that certain model hamiltonians that were originally proposed to explain exotic quantum behavior in condesned matter systems and sometimes in high energy physics can be realized with ultra cold atoms in various type of optical potentials . in a typical condensed matter or high energy systems , the actual system is far more complex than one described by such model hamiltonians and that leaves a lot of issues less than verified .",
    "ultra cold atomic systems on the otherhand much more controlled and model behavior can be studied almost exactly . in nature electromagnetic fields",
    "are known as abelian gauge field whereas more complicated non abelian gauge fields are the one that are responsible for strong and weak interaction .",
    "gauge fields are therefore known and confirmed to define three fundamental interaction formed the very basis of our understanding of the microscopic world @xcite .",
    "given this crucial role of gauge fields in fundamental physics the recent success in simulation of abelian and non abelian gauge fields for ultra cold neutral atoms @xcite is one of the most significant achievment in the field of ultra cold atomic research .",
    "apart from allowing us studying the fields responsible for fundamental interaction in a non - trivial context this development also opens the possibility of studying the model hamiltonians that predicts quantum hall effect @xcite , topological insulators and superconductors @xcite , interesting vortex phases in superconductor @xcite and other interesting magnetic field dependent phenomena in electronic system .",
    "there have been already a number of excellent and detailed review articles written by some of the most prominent experts in this field .",
    "we are not going to repeat the topic of their review .",
    "what we want to describe the basic physics associated with the processes that creates such synthetic abelian and non abelian gauge field for ultra cold atomic system and a systematic comparison with true gauge fields that occurs in nature and responsible for the fundamental interactions with the aim to analyze their `` fundamental''-ness .",
    "to that prupose we shall first begin with the gauge invarinace of schrdinger equation ( for example see @xcite ) for abelian gauge theory in sec .",
    "[ abl ] . in the next section [ nonab ]",
    "we shall introduce the non abelian gauge theory . rather than taking a field theory route we shall do that in a theoretical background of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "in the next section [ sec : berry ] we shall show how such gauge fields described in the two preceeding section can arise in ordinary quantum mechanics purely for geometrical reasons . in the next section [ rotbose ]",
    "we shall show how in rotatating bose einstein condensate such an abelian gauge field can be simulated .",
    "the section [ coldberry ] describes a general scheme of producing abelian and non abelian gauge potential for multilevel ultra cold atoms by using laser induced coupling between different hyperfine states . in the next section",
    "we shall try to describe how both the `` fundamental gauge fields '' as well as their synthetic counterpart in ultra cold atomic systems known as geometric gauge potentials to a more fundamental geometrical concept of parallel transport .",
    "we shall also briefly describe in this section why inspite of this connection the gauge fieldsfor ultra cold atomic systems are called `` synthetic '' . in the next section [ sec : so ] as a specific example of syntehtic non - abelian gauge field , we shall explain how synthetic spin - orbit coupling for ultra cold gases",
    ". we shall finlly conclude .",
    "in this setion we shall start with the gauge invariance properties of the ordinary schrdinger equation in quantum mechanics , namely how this equation transforms under the gauge transformation and how does it compare with our knowledge about gauge invariance from classical physics .",
    "though any standard book on `` quantum mechanics '' may be consulted for more detail , we shall closely follow the discourse given in the book by j. j. sakurai @xcite    in quantum mechanics our description of a physical system starts with schrdinger equation i = h the solution of this equation can be written as ( , t ) = ( t ) ( , 0 ) where the time evolution operator @xmath0 .",
    "we shall consider the quantum mechanical motion of a charged particle in presence of electric and magnetic field .",
    "such a situation is very common to many solid state electronic systems where one can subject the free electrons that carry electric current to such forces . according to the law of electrodynamics such electric and magentic field",
    "can be given in terms of scalar potential @xmath1 and vector potential @xmath2 such that = - ; = for the discussion below we shall only concentrate on the vector potential alone , which can be wasily generalized to scalar potential .",
    "this is because according to the convention of special relativity , scalar and vector potential are just the time and space like components of a four potential .",
    "= 0 = = ( + ) , [ vector ]    similarly if v= v -    = + then = - v - = - v - = [ scalar ] therefore , classical electrodynamics tells us that upto a gauge transformations the vector and scalar potentials are arbitrary .",
    "this means that two vector potentials differ from each other by a gradient of a well behaved scalar function @xmath3 , will lead to the same magnetic field which is clearly a measurable quantitity .",
    "this non uniqueness of the vector potential for a given magnetic field however does not create a problem in describing the motion of charged partile in classical mechanics under newton s laws .",
    "this is because the force on such classical charged particle , lorenz force is given by f = q .",
    "therefore in classical physics the fundamental quantity is magnetic field and vector potential is more like mathematicl quantity that defines such magnetic field upto a gauge transformation . by this statement",
    "all the physically measurable quantities must depend on the magnetic field and not on the vector potential .",
    "we shall first construct the definition of gauge transformation from the preceeding discussion and then continue to improve over it in this section before going to ultra cold atoms . summarizing the above description , such a transofrmation is the one that links a vector potential with another with both yielding the same magnetic field .",
    "magnetic field is therefore a gauge invariant quantity and only this appears in the classical equation of motion .",
    "this is why all measureable dynamical variables in particle mechanics are gauge invariant .",
    "please note at this stage we did not mention anything to the field part of the lagrangian which is required for a complete description of the problem .",
    "this is done keeping in mind the special situation in ultra cold atoms which we want to analyze in this particular review .",
    "one can therefore expect at the level of quantum mechnaics where we only quantize the motion of the partilce and use the same field as used in the classical mechanics , such gauge invariance should be respected .",
    "the hamiltonian in presence of such magnetic field is given as h = ( - ) ^2 . in the above expression ,",
    "the canonical momentum is @xmath4 is distinguished from the mechanical momentum = - however the previously proposed idea about gauge invariance now needs a careful scrutiny since the vector potential now appears directly in the hamiltonian .",
    "it can be checked that the commutation relations between different components of the mechanical momentum does not vanish , = _",
    "ijkb_k however the commutator is indeed gauge invaraint . using the above commuttator and the fact that h = it can be straightforwardly shown that the spectrum is given by so called one dimensional harmonic oscillator like landau levels e_n = ( n+ ) _ c ; _ c = the energy spectrum is thus a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "however the gauge invariant form of the energy and the basic commutation relation not necessarlty ensures that relevant physical quantities in quantum mechanics , such as the transition matrix elements two different states under the action of a given operator are necessarily gauge invariant .    to understand this issue better ,",
    "let us recall the ehrenfest theorem which states that expectation values of the observables in quantum mechanics behave in the same way like the classical quantities .",
    "therefore we can expect them to transform in the same gauge invariant way like classical quantities .",
    "as one can see this is not trivially staisfied , since what appears in the dynamical variable like hamiltonian is @xmath5 and not @xmath2 .",
    "this tells us that under a gauge ransformation the operators indeed gets afftected . to see how the gauge invriance of expectation values can be ensured ,",
    "let us define a state ket @xmath6 in presence of vector poetential @xmath5 and the corresponding state ket @xmath7 for the same magnetic field with a different vector potential @xmath8 .",
    "our basic requirement for gauge invariance is | | & = & ",
    "+    both kets are normalized there must be a unitary operator such that |",
    " = |[u1wf ] the invariance of position and momentum expectation value then demands ^ = + ^ ( - - ) & = & - one can immediately see that the unitary operator that does that job is = [ u1 ] this is actually the generator of @xmath9 gauge transformation and is same as a phase transformation .",
    "this is also the simplest gauge transformation .",
    "the moral of the above strory is that in quantum mechanics to to keep dynamical variables @xmath9 gauge invariant , the wavefunction also need to changes under gauge tranformation and acquire an additional phase .",
    "this has highly non trivial consequences such as aharanov - bohm effect .",
    "however to stay focussed on our topic in the next section we shall not discuss this issue further .",
    "the function @xmath3 that appeared as the exponent and implenets the gauge tranformation is a function of local cordinates . since all such functions comuutes with each other , such a gauge transformation is called abelian . in the next section",
    "we shall consider more complicated gauge tranformations which are non - abelian .",
    "we shall now introduce non abelian gauge field using the language of quantum mechanics rather than quantum field theory .",
    "to this purpose we shall follow the treatment given in ref .",
    "yang and mills in 1954 generalized this gauge(phase ) invariance properties of the schoredinger equation for multicomponent wave function , namely when wavefunction has internal degrees of freedom apart from the co - ordinate space or orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "as we know when the wavefunction has such internal degrees of freedom , then the wavefunction is a complex vector defined at each point in space time rather than a complex number . in such case ( , t )",

    "however unlike in the previous case , here we pretend that initially have no idea what type of `` electromagnetic field '' will demand the resulting gauge invarinace .",
    "so we started by demanding generalization of such gauge invariance for a multi - component schrdinger equation and wait for the outcome .    since here",

    ". however , the abelian gauge transformations are equivalent to phase transofrmations and non abelian gauge transformations are their higher dimensional generalization .",
    "one can therefoee naturally ask the question whether such a transformation arises in the other domain of quantum mechanics and if the answer is yes what are the possible realizations .",
    "this question was answered in the clearest form by m. v. berry in his seminal work @xcite based on a number of other works which already indicated the existence of such different type of gauge fields in a number of physical phenomena , that spans optics @xcite , chemistry @xcite , atomic and molecular physics @xcite etc .",
    "a selected collection of papers on this related topic is available in shapere and wilczek edited book @xcite .",
    "here we follow a pedagogical account of the key argument given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to this purpose",
    "we shall consider the the phase change in a quantum mechanical wavefunction under an adiabatic change .",
    "the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics tells us that if the particle hamiltonian is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is some external co - ordinate which changes suffiiciently slowly ( slower than the natural time scale set by the typical enegy spacing in the unperturbed system ) and appears parametrically in @xmath20 , then the particle will sit in the @xmath21-th instantaneous eigenstate of @xmath22 at the time @xmath23 if it started out in the @xmath21-th eigenstate of @xmath24    the solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation for this case is    factor comes from the usual time evolution of an eigenstate of the hamiltonian , after taking into account the fact that one is dealing with the instantaneous eigenstate of the time dependent hamiltonian which is changing with time .",
    "the other factor @xmath25 is kept to check the fact if due to the time evolution of the basis states is there any non - trivial additional time dependence . substituting the state ( [ berry1 ] ) in the time dependent schrdinger equation and taking the inner product with the instantaneous @xmath26 one",
    "gets = -c(t ) n(t ) | | n(t ) with the solution c(t ) = c(0 ) e^i ( t ) with @xmath27 .",
    "the important thing here to notice that this phase is arising because the basis state @xmath28 is constantly changing with time .",
    "the instantaneous adiabatic state can therefore be writtes as |n ( r ) ( t ) _ a = e^ i ( t ) | n(r(t ) ) where the subscript @xmath29 is used to denote the difference with a time evolved state in the absence of such phase factor .",
    "we know that an extra phase factor in a quantum mechanical state may not have any measurable consequences .",
    "however in the presence case actually it does have .",
    "we shall explian it here .",
    "let us rewrite exp(- _",
    "0^t n(t ) | | n(t ) dt ) & = & (",

    "( [ vector ] ) in the previous section [ abl ] .",
    "the transformation of the wavefunction defined in ( [ berry2 ] ) is same as the one defined in eq .",
    "( [ u1wf ] ) for real electromagnetic field . what motivates a gauge invariant quantity in this case ?",
    "to see that , consider a case where the adiabatic parameter @xmath19 comes back to the same value after a time period @xmath30 .",
    "this implies @xmath31 and @xmath32 . under that case",
    "the singlevaluedness of the wave function in the parameter ( r ) space demands that the line integral of the berry curvature around the closed loop in the parameter space must be invariant under such gauge or phase tranformation .",
    "this is the same condition which states that two vector potential @xmath5 and @xmath33 differing from each other through a gauge transformation when integrated over a closed contour will be same since this is equal to the flux enclosed by the area ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus the berry curvature exactly plays the same role as the vector potentail due to a real magnetic field under gauge transformation and its effect on the wave function , namely the integral of the vector potential around a close loop in the co - ordinate space is gauge invariant as demanded by the single valuedness of the wavefunction .",
    "a pertinent question at this point is whether such adiabatic evolution of the time ( parameter ) dependent hamiltonian will also generated a scalar potential along side a vector potential .",
    "this is important to establish to full analogy with electromagnetic theory , since vector and scalar potentials are space and time like component of the four potential that apears in a relativistically invariant theory of electromagnetism .",
    "it turns out in this case theire also exists a corresponding scalar potential which has the form v(r ) = [ | | n(r ) |^2 - n(r ) | n(r ) n(r ) | | n(r ) .",
    "we again refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for the detailed derivation of this accompanying scalar potential .",
    "the gauge potentials described in this section are known in the literature as geometric gauge potential because of their origin .",
    "the adiabatic parameter that appears here is not necessarily a scalar , it could be a vector as well , namely @xmath35 , having a certain number of components . in that case",
    "a straightforward generalization of the above calculation will show in that case berry curvature will be a matrix and its different component will generate the non abelian counterpart of the geometric gauge potential .",
    "the most significant impact of the concept of `` berry curvature '' or `` geometric vector potential '' is that it opens the possibility of identifying gauge poetntial and fields in a wide variety of quantum systems . in the following section",
    "we shall analyze how these concept leads to the creation of synthetic gauge field for ultra cold atoms .",
    "the simplest example of implementing the artificial or synthetic gauge field for cold atomic condensates is through rotation .",
    "this was accomplished by ens group @xcite , mit group @xcite and jila group @xcite .",
    "this method exploits the equivalence between the coriolis force in a rotating frame and lorenz force acting on an electron in a uniform magnetic field @xcite . in this scheme",
    "the trap in which an ultra cold condensate is created is rotated by using a moving laser .    if the plane of this rotation is taken as @xmath36 plane and the symmetry axis as @xmath37 , the effect of such rotation on spatial co - ordinate is given by r_z ( )    x + y    r_z()^ =    &",
    "+ - &    x + y    here @xmath38 is the rotation operator about @xmath37 axis . if the rotation is executed at an uniform angular velocity @xmath39 , then @xmath40 .",
    "we can immediately see the connecion between @xmath41 and the u(1 ) gauge transformation defined in ( [ u1 ] ) .    the time dependent hamiltonian that describes a trapped boson in a rotating frame is given by h(t ) = r_z(t ) [ + m ( _ x^2 x^2 + _ y^2 y^2 ) ] r_z^ ( t ) since the @xmath42 remains invariant under the rotation it yields h(t ) & = & + [ ( _ x^2(x t + y t)^2 + & + & _ y^2 ( -x t + y t)^2 ] [ rotham ]    one neeeds to solve the time dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for such system which is i = h(t ) .",
    "[ tdse ] however to do equilibrium thermodynamics of a systems of such bosons it it useful to go to the co - rotating from where the hamiltonian does not change with time . for that one needs to do a unitary tranformation on the wave function by writing  = r_z^ ( t )",
    "this is again equivalent to the gauge transformation given in ( [ u1wf ] ) where the @xmath43 is the wave function in the co - rotating frame .",
    "the transformed tdse for @xmath43 looks like i = [ + ( _ x^2 x^2 + _ y^2 y^2 ) + l_z ]  [ tdse1 ]    one can check the time independent hamiltonian on the right hand side can be written as h = + m [ _ x^2 x^2 + _",
    "y^2 y^2 - ^2 r^2 ] thus the unitary transformation that takes the wavefunction to the co - rotating frame , also induces a gauge potential in the stationary hamiltonian in the co - rotating frame . comparing with our discussion in section [ abl ]",
    "we can comment that the unitary operator @xmath44 defines here is mathematically same as unitary gauge transformation operator @xmath45 defined the tranformation of the hamiltonian operator introduces a gauge potential .",
    "the gauge ( vector ) potential and the gauge field obtaained in this way is of the form & = & - y + x + & = & 2    this is however not the only effect on the hamiltonian by the unitary tranformation .",
    "it will also introduce a scalar potential v_r ( ) = - m ^2 r^2 [ decon ] thus the effective trap potential in the rotating frame gets reduced .",
    "as we can see we can equivalently the creation of such `` artificial '' gauge field through rotation can also be explained by using the concept of berry curvature discussed in section @xcite .",
    "one can recognize here that the adiabatic parameter is the time dependent rotation angle @xmath46 and the hamiltonian is a function of this parameter @xmath47 .",
    "if the rotational frequency is ramped up adiabatically , then it can be ensured that system will always stay in the ground state of the rotated hamiltonian provided the initial system is in the ground stat    the ultra cold atomic bose einstein condensate we are going to talk about consists of interacting bosons .",
    "however in the typical experimental condition , the system is described very well by the mean field gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we choose a two dimensional condensate that can be derived from a three dimensional model for a rotating cigar shaped condensate .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation is i = ( - ^2 + m ( _ x^2 x^2 + _",

    "it can be readily verified that the non - linear term is invrainat under the action of the unitary operator @xmath50 .",

    "an interesting regime is where the rotational frequency @xmath39 is almost equal to the trap frequency in the transverse plane @xmath51 .",
    "this means the the trap potential almost becomes negligible . because of the entry of the large number of vortices in the ultra cold condensate under this condition , a number of interesting phases of large number of vortices appear in this regime .",
    "this is the regime of rapidly rotating ultra cold gas and have been reviewed extensively in @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we have seen how synthetic abelian field can be created for ultra cold atoms exploiting the similarity between the rotational operator about a particular axis with a @xmath9 gauge transformation .",

    "thus the cold atom analogue of strongly correlated phases of two dimensional electronic systems in a perpendicular magnetic field with high value ( of the order of several tesla ) such as quantum hall phases @xcite can not be created in this set - up .",

    "this gives us the following `` gauged '' schoredinger equation for @xmath66 .",
    "i = [ + + v]_1 [ schabelian ] here @xmath5 and @xmath13 are essentially the vector potential and scalar potential that arises due to the geometric phaase created by the the slowly changing hilber space basis from one point to other .",
    "the resulting vector potential is given by in this case ( ) = i n _ ( ) | n _ ( ) = ( -1 )    the synthetic magnetic field that is created due to the vector potential is given by ( ) = [ syntheticb ] the magnetic field and vector potential crreated in this way have geometric origin .",
    "it can concluded from the preceeding discussion on berry s phase that this gauge potential can not be `` gauged away '' completely if the magnetic field ( [ syntheticb ] ) is non zero since the line integral of this vector potential around a closed contour in a region where the magnetic field is non - zero should be equal to the flux enclosed by this region .",
    "this apart , the changing basis of the hilbert space also introduces a scalar potential v ( ) =    generating a synthetic vector and scalar potential in this way , that if we consider the hamiltonian of a trapped system , the scalar potential does not offset the trap potential .",
    "the scalar potential in this case also can be repusive and attractive @xcite .",
    "also given the fact that there are various way of coupling different hyperfine states of ultra cold atomic multiplets , such a scheme provides one an wide range of possibilities to create such geometrically induced synthetic gauge potential and gauge field .",
    "but as we see in the next section that one of the most interesting aspect of this scheme is the fact that it can be easily generalized to create a non abelian - gauge field .",
    "one of the earliest paper that introduces the concept of such non - abelian geometric phases in a general context iis the work by wilczek and zee @xcite .",
    "here we shall discuss a specific example involving ultra cold atoms and laser following @xcite .",
    "particularly we shall show how idea discussed in the preceeding section can be easily generalized to creat synthetic non - abelian gauge field when a @xmath67 state atomic system with @xmath68 is suitable configuration of laser beams . a prototype configuration is displayed in fig . [ atomlaser ] ( b ) .",
    "the structure of the the coupling matrix @xmath69 will be u ( ) =    1 | u ( ) | 1 & 1 | u ( ) ) 2 & & 1 | u ( ) | n+1 + 2 |u ( ) | 1 & & & 2 | u ( ) ) | n+1 + & & & + n+1 | u ( ) | 1 & & & n+1 | u ( ) | n+1    for a fixed position @xmath59 the above matrix can be diagonalized to give @xmath67 dressed states @xmath70 with energy eigenvalues @xmath71 where @xmath72 goes from @xmath73 to @xmath67 . under certain circumstances",
    "it happens that a subset @xmath74 out of this @xmath67 states are either degenrate or quasi - denerate and are well separated from he rest of states energetically .",
    "it is under this candition it is possible to realize adiabatic motion in this low lying dgenerate subspace @xmath75 of dimension @xmath74 . assuming that the motional states are such that there is almost no scattering from this low ebergy subspace @xmath75 to @xmath76 higher energy state .",
    "again we can write the full wave function of the |= _ i=1^n+1 _",
    "i ( ) | n_i ( ) and then we can project this schredinger equation to the reduce hilbert space @xmath75 to get an equation for the reduced spinorial wavefunction @xmath77 .",
    "we can straightforwardedly extent the gauged schrdinger equation given in eq .",
    "( [ schabelian ] ) to its spinorial countepart , namely i = [ + + v]_q with the important differences that @xmath5 and @xmath13 are now matrices with their matrix elements given by . _",
    "i , j & = & in_i ( )    v_i , j & = & _ l = q+1^n+1 _ il _ l , j since different component ( @xmath78 ) these effective vector potentials being matrices will not generally commute with each other and are therefore called non ableian vector potential.here @xmath79 corresponds to the energy of the unperturbed atomic systems .",
    "the above described atom - light interaction induced syntehtic abelian or non - abelian gauge potential has been successfully implemented by i. b. spielman s group @xcite in nist by coupling atomic states with raman lasers .",
    "they created synthetic magnetic field , electric field as well as so coupling in ultracold atomic systems .",
    "however it may be noted inspite of the fact that nist method was able to overcome some of the difficulties that was encountered in rotating an ultra cold atomic system , particularly in the process of creating high `` synthetic '' magnetic field , it has its own limitations .",
    "here the highest possible value of the synthetic magnetic field is capped by the wavevector of the raman laser . a detailed discussion on these experiments appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite which one can see for more details .",
    "very recently there has been experimental success in creating optical flux lattices @xcite where it is possible to create much higher value of synthetic magnetic field .",
    "we are not covering this topic here and direct the reader to the refs . @xcite and the refs .",
    "cited there for the same .",
    "studying the effect of artificial gauge field in presence of optical lattice is another interesting topic which is also not covered in this article .",
    "a summary of the relevant work and discussion on some relevant issues for this topic is available in ref .",
    "the other case of synthetic gauge field for cold atoms that we shall discuss in some detail in subsequent section [ sec : so ] is the principle of creating synthetic spin - orbit coupling for ultra cold bosonic atoms .",
    "however before that here we shall provide a comprehensive analysis of the `` synthetic - ness '' of the gauge field created from the geometric phases .      in this section",
    "we shall briefly digress the origin of gauge field in quantum mechanics / field theory and discuss the existence of similar reason in the current case of synthetic gauge field for ultra cold atoms .",
    "we know from quantum mechanics @xcite that a spinorial ( two - component ) wave function tranforms under a spin rotation as  = ( ) here = _ ijk_k obeys the standard commutation relation between the the generators of the su(2 ) rotation in the spin - spce .",
    "under such general su(2 ) transformation a @xmath21-dimensional iso - spinor similarly tranforms as = ( i m^ ^ ) = ( x ) ( x ) . in field theory a system is said to have gauge invariance , if under such tranformation the defining lagrangian density remains invariant .",
    "the lagrangian density involves the derivative of the field .",
    "same is true for the wavefunction in quantum mechanics where the hamiltonian involves the derivative of the wavefunction . for that it is important that the @xmath80 , must change covariantly .",
    "now it can be immediately checked that this is not the case for the usual derivatiove as _ mu  = ( _ ) + ( _ ) this happens because because under the generalized spin - rotation , the axes in the space of such isospin is getting at each point in space .",
    "thus @xmath81 and @xmath82 are measured in different co - ordinate system . to make the derivative co - variant",
    "one should compare @xmath83 with the modified value of @xmath81 if it were transported from @xmath84 to @xmath85 keeping the iso - spin axis fixed .",
    "this is known as parallel transport in isospace .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ parallel ] . under this condition",
    "the change in the @xmath48 will be different and this change @xmath86 can be written as = ig m^a a^a _ dx^ here @xmath87 which takes care of the change in the local co - ordinate axes in the isospace from one point to another .",
    "the derivative defines in this way becomes d & = & ( + d ) - ( + ) + & = & d - ig m^a a^a _ dx^ + = d _ & = & ( _ - ig m^a a^a _ )    it can be checked the above modified derivative transform covariantly under the guage transformation and is therefore qualified to enter into the the gauge invariant lagrangian density .",
    "here @xmath88 are the generators of the rotation in the iso - spin space and their detail form depends on relevant group that represents the symmetry .",
    "the simplest of this case is @xmath9 rotation where @xmath89 .",
    "if particularly it corresponds to our problem of a charged particle in electromagnetic field @xmath90 .",
    "under that situation d _",
    "= _ + ie a _ .",
    "the above discussion is available in a number of field theory books that discuss gauge field theory .",
    "we here mostly followed the notation and discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite . now comparing this discussion with the discussion in the preceeding section ( [ abel ] and [ nonabel ] )",
    ", we can immediately recognise that there also it is the chaging basis in the pseudospin space under adiabatic evolution .",
    "the adiabatic evolution of these basis states leads to the development of syntehtic gauge field or berry curvature and has a similar geometrical interpretation like the true gauge field .",
    "finally this brings us to a important question , namely why inspite of this similar geometrical origin , we call the berry curvature related gauge field in ultra cold atoms as `` synthetic '' .",
    "the reason is in true gauge field theory there is purely gauge field dependent term in the lagrangian density @xcite which stands for the field energy .",
    "it is this term which gives the gauge field their independent dynamics in the complete matter - field lagrangian density .",
    "thus such gauge field are dynamical .",
    "the corresponding gauge potentials appeared in the covariant momentum operator .",
    "however in the atom - laser configuration the full lagrangian density does not contain any such field energy term which is related to the berry curvature generated due to adiabatic motion .",
    "the field part that apeears here is just the electromagnetic field energy associated with the laser and the not one related to the geometric gauge field .",
    "this is why geometric gauge field do not have any independent dynamics .",
    "the motivation behind creating synthetic spin - orbit coupling for ultra cold atoms primarily comes from the fact that spin orbit coupling plays a very important role in spinotronics @xcite and topological insulators @xcite either of which have interesting practical applications .",
    "however spin - orbit coupling also forms an interesting example for non abelian gauge potential which we shall describe in the following discussion .      in our familiar notation",
    "a non abelian vector potential can be written as = a_x + a_y + a_z where @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are now matrices . field strength for such non abelian vector potential given by the expression ( [ nonabf ] ) can be written as = - [ naf ] one can now easily identify that in the expression ( [ naf ] ) , the first part is a straight forward generalization of the relation between vector potential and magnetic field for the abelian case , the second part is only non zero if the gauge potential is non abelian . for abelian cases , the second part is identically zero .",
    "a major motivation of simulating synthetic magnetic field for ultra cold atoms is to observe quantum hall effect like phenomena which occurs when a two dimensional electron gas is subjected to an transverse uniform magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a related question can therefore be asked what are the gauge potentials that can create an uniform non abelian magnetic field .",
    "a detailed analysis of this probelm was done in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we provide a brief summary of the relevant results to discuss subsequently in some detail why and how one creates synthetic spin - orbit coupling for ultra cold atomic systems .",
    "an important difference between abelian and non abelian gauge field is that , where as in the case of the former two vector potentials that creates the same magnetic field are related to each other by a simple gauge transformations , in the case of non abelian field that is not the case . by that one",
    "means that two non - equivalent non - abelian gauge potential can lead to the same non - abelian magnetic field .",
    "following @xcite we shall illustrate this case for the non abelian magnetic field = 2 _ z = 2    & 0 + 0 & -    the above magnetic field is uniform but its direction is opposite for spin - up and spin - down component of the wavefunction of the particle on which it is applied .",
    "one type of vector potential that can give such uniform field is given by = = y_z -x _ z this is again a starightforward generalization of vector potential in symmetric gauge for uniform magnetic field @xmath94 and here the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field only through the first term ( on r.h.s . ) of the expression ( [ naf ] ) for non abelian field strength .",
    "even though all component of the vector potential are matrices , they are abelian matrices .",
    "thus this is also the case of abelian gauge field .",
    "the single particle spectrum of schrdinger equation in presence of such gauge potential is a generalization of the landau problem .",
    "quantity like magnetic length , phenomenon like aharonov bohm effect etc . can be defined for such problem .",
    "another type of vector potential that can also generate the same magnetic field is given by = -_y + _ x [ sona ] .",
    "this is an uniform ( does not depend on local co - ordinate ) non commuting vector potential .",
    "this is indeed non abelian gauge potential .",
    "the contribution to the field purely comes from the second term in the expression ( [ naf ] ) .",
    "the single particle spectrum of schrdinger equation in presence of such gauge potential is very different from the landau problem @xcite .",
    "however there is more interesting motivation for realizing such non abelian gauge potential for ultra cold atoms .    to see this",
    "let is recall the well known spin - orbit coupling ( thomas term ) which arises due to relativistic correction to the motion of a spin-1/2 electron obeying schrdinger equation , namely h_so = - ( ) [ so ]    using the tripple product rule the above hamiltonian can be rewritten as h_so = ( )    for a uniform electric field along @xmath95-axis , @xmath96 is just the non abelian uniform vector potential defined in eq .",
    "( [ sona ] ) . identifying this",
    "we can rewrite h_so ( ) where @xmath5 corresponds to the vector potential defined in eq .",
    "( [ sona ] ) .",
    "such a term therefore also appear in the kinetic energy term of the hamiltonian , h_k = ( -m ) ^2 that describes a free particle in the presence of non abelian gauge field ( [ sona ] ) .",
    "thus the simulation of such synthetic non abelian gauge field for ultra cold atoms is equivalent to create synthetic spin - orbit ( so ) coupling for such systems .",
    "so coupling plays a crucial role in spinotronics @xcite and topological insulator @xcite . with this background",
    "we shall now briefly discuss how such so coupling is created experimentally for ultra cold bec .",
    "more      to generate so coupling one considers the @xmath97rb atoms whose ground state electronic structure is @xmath98s@xmath99 giving electron spin is @xmath100 and nuclear spin is @xmath101 .",
    "therefore the total spin @xmath102 can take value @xmath103 and @xmath104 due to hyperfline coupling .",
    "the low energy manifold therefore consists of three @xmath103 states .",
    "such states are characterized by by state vectors @xmath105 which represents simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath106 and @xmath107 operators and for @xmath103 , they are respectively given as @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "a schematic for the set - up is given in fig .",
    "[ raman ] . in presence of zeeman field",
    "all these three levels that have same energy will split into three different levels .",
    "the resultant system is exposed to two counter propagating raman laser beams along the @xmath111 direction .",
    "the atom which is moving with velocity @xmath112 along @xmath111 direction will absorb a photon coming from the oposite direction of laser i and will have momentum @xmath113 . from this excited state it will emit a a photon in the direction of laser ii . as a result finally the momentum of the state along the @xmath84-direction will be @xmath114 .",
    "therefore the state will finally be written as @xmath115 . here",
    "the first quantum number corresponds to the hyperfine quantum number @xmath116 , whereas the second one gives the momentum along the @xmath111 direction.similarly the atoms absorbing photon from laser ii and emitting a photon in the direction of laser i will be finally in the state @xmath117 . the final outcome is to have the following three states |1 & = & | 1 , k_x + 2k_l +     hamiltonian now in @xmath118 matrix form that includes contribution from atom , field ( laser ) and atom - laser interaction .",
    "however as has been shown explicitly in @xcite , it is possible to to tune the zeeman energy and the laser frequency in such a way , that the low energy subspace created by @xmath119 and @xmath120 states are well separated from the @xmath108 state . under this situation",
    "it is possible to construct an effective hamiltonian in this two dimensional hilbert space spanned by hyperfine state @xmath121 and @xmath122 which we shall respectively call as spin up @xmath123 and spin - down @xmath124 state .",
    "this is somewhat modified version of the scheme suggested in section [ nonabel ] .",
    "the @xmath125 effective hamiltonian becomes ,    h =    + & e^2ik_lx + e^-2ik_lx & -    here @xmath126 is the momentum transfer due to the relative motion between the laser and the hyperfine state of the atom and @xmath127 is the detuning between the raman resonance and the energy difference between the spin up and spin - down level .",
    "we have also absorbed an overall @xmath128 factor in various terms .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for the details about the derivation of the above hamiltonian .",
    "if one makes an unitary trasnformation on the two component wave function that will describe this system such that @xmath129 , with u=    e^-ik_lx & 0 + 0 & e^ik_lx +    this changes the hamiltonian from @xmath20 to @xmath130 which is given by h_so =    + & + & - +    [ soh ]    as one can see the resulting hamiltonian can be written as h_so= + _ x + _ z [ hso1 ] the above hamiltonian is the spin - orbit coupled hamiltonian realized in nist experiment @xcite .",
    "even though here the vector potential has only one component @xmath91 , however since that does not commute with the scalar potential @xmath131 , this is one of simplest realization of uniform non abelian gauge potential .",
    "with a suitable spin rotation it can also be shown that the first term actually represent and linear combination of equal weight rashba and dresselhaus so coupling .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are _ k = [ detuning ]    which for zero detuning @xmath132 , the momentum dependent energy eigenvalues can be given as _",
    "k = the condition for the minima of the energy can now be obtained from @xmath133 which gives one k_x & = & 0 +   k_x & = & k_0 [ minima ] here @xmath134 one can now checked the following things from the above expression . if the detuning @xmath127 is @xmath135 , there will be distinctly one minima for @xmath136 at @xmath137 and another minima at @xmath138 for @xmath139",
    ". however if the detuning @xmath127 is finite then whereas there is single minima at @xmath137 for @xmath136 , there are two non - degenrate minima at different height for @xmath140 .",
    "the height difference can be controlled by the detuning and the transition from single to two minima is the way one can detect the spin - orbit coupling @xcite . for details of the experimental method",

    "we have particularly show how both fundamental and synthetic gauge field can be interpreted in a similar geometric way ; however the later does not have any independent dynamics and hence dubbed as synthetic .",
