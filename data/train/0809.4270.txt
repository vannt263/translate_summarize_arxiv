    "2004 ) provide relatively poor photometric accuracy .",

    "the only overhead is that typically a shorter exposure in which the tycho-2 catalog stars will not be saturated is required .",
    "from the tycho-2 catalog ( hog et al . 2000 ) , i selected all stars with @xmath23  mag and @xmath24  mag . this choice was made in order to remove stars with magnitude uncertainties @xmath25  mag .",

    "the final list contains 1,560,980 stars .",
    "next , i fitted the tycho-2/2mass magnitudes of these stars with synthetic photometry , in the @xmath27 bands , of 131 stellar spectral templates ( pickles 1998 ) .",

    "the field of view of large format cameras may contain only several suitable tycho-2 stars ( see fig .",

    "i have carried out the following simulations : i randomly selected @xmath37 stars , for any @xmath37 between 2 and 100 , out of the 3714 sdss standard stars that i used for the comparison of the derived magnitudes with the actual sdss magnitudes .",
    "for each set of randomly selected @xmath37 stars i calculated the median of differences between the @xmath28-fitted synthetic magnitudes and the sdss magnitudes .",

    "[ fig : error_vs_nstars ] i show the standard deviation of the distribution of the median of differences between the synthetic magnitudes and the measured sdss magnitudes , as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "the plot suggests that , for example , by using five stars the errors in photometry reduce to 0.07mag , 0.04mag , 0.03mag and 0.03mag in the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15-bands , respectively .",
    "when using ten stars the errors reduce to about 0.04mag , 0.03mag , 0.02mag and 0.02mag in the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15-bands , respectively . in order to remove outliers",
    "it is important to use the median of differences ( i.e. , and not mean of differences ) .    to summarize , i suggest an alternative method for photometric calibration that may work to accuracy of about several percents .",
    "this method relies on selected stars in the tycho-2 catalog for which i fitted spectral templates to their @xmath27 magnitudes .",
    "two major limitation of this method is that several tycho-2 stars are needed in the field of view , and that shorter exposures , in which these stars are not saturated , are required . given the catalog star density as a function of galactic latitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tyc2_starden ] ) , this method is applicable for instruments with large field of view or for low galactic latitude observations .",
