    "in recent years great observational progress has been made in measuring the constituents of the universe ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it appears that the universe is currently dominated by an unexpected component that is causing the universe to accelerate in its expansion .",
    "this component is dubbed `` dark energy '' . understanding the nature of dark energy is one of most fundamental questions that remain unresolved with the current cosmological data sets ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is now the focus of several planned future surveys @xcite .    whether the accelerating expansion is as a consequence of the cosmological constant , a new fluid or a modification to einstein s gravity",
    ", these future surveys will provide key information .",
    "in addition they will provide a wealth of further cosmological information , such as constraints on the neutrino mass and the spectrum of primordial perturbations generated in the early universe ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "combining several techniques accessible from different cosmological observables is often a powerful way to improve constraints on cosmology .",
    "however , care must be taken if the observables are not completely independent .",
    "two of the most promising methods for constraining the dark energy are galaxy cluster counts and cosmic shear ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "clusters of galaxies contain galaxies , hot gas and dark matter in ratio approximately 1:10:100 @xcite .",
    "they are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe and the number of clusters of galaxies has long been recognized as a powerful probe of cosmology @xcite . counting clusters of galaxies as a function of redshift allows a combination of structure growth and geometrical information to be extracted , thus potentially allowing constraints on the nature of dark energy @xcite .",
    "if cluster masses can be measured accurately then the shape of the mass function also helps to break degeneracies @xcite .",
    "the distribution of clusters on the sky ( e.g. two - point correlation function ) carries additional information on dark energy @xcite .",
    "the bending of light by mass , gravitational lensing , causes images of distant galaxies to be distorted .",
    "these sheared source galaxies are mostly too weakly distorted for us to measure the effect in single galaxies , but require surveys containing a few million galaxies to detect the signal in a statistical way .",
    "this cosmic shear signal has been observed @xcite and used to constrain cosmology ( most recently @xcite ) . by using redshift information of source galaxies the evolution of the dark matter distribution with redshift can be inferred .",
    "hence , measuring the cosmic shear two - point function as a function of redshift and separation between pairs of galaxies can be used to constrain the geometry of the universe as well as the growth of mass clustering .",
    "this method has emerged as one of the most promising to obtain precise constraints on the nature of dark energy if systematics are well under control @xcite .",
    "future optical imaging surveys suitable for cosmic shear analysis will also allow the identification of clusters of galaxies .",
    "this could be done either using the colors of the cluster members ( e.g. @xcite ) or using peaks in the gravitational lensing shear field ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition cluster surveys in other wavebands will overlap with the cosmic shear surveys allowing detection using x - rays and the thermal sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz ) effect .",
    "clusters of galaxies produce a large gravitational lensing effect on distant galaxies , therefore cluster counts and cosmic shear will not be strictly statistically independent .",
    "the volume surveyed is finite and therefore the number of clusters observed will not be exactly equal to the average over all universe realizations . if the number of clusters happens to be higher for a given survey region , then the cosmic shear signal is also likely to be higher .",
    "although the volumes will be large , and thus the deviation is small , this may amount to a significant uncertainty in the dark energy parameters as obtained by cluster counts , and dominates the non - gaussian errors on the cosmic shear @xcite .",
    "one aspect of this cross - correlation was discussed in @xcite and found to be negligible . however , here we make a full treatment of this effect using the halo model for non - linear structure formation , and quantify the resulting change in joint constraints on the dark energy parameters .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in   [ prel ] we describe how",
    "our observables , cluster number counts and lensing power spectra , can be expressed in terms of the background cosmological model and the density perturbations . in ",
    "[ cov ] , we describe a methodology to compute covariances of the cluster counts and the lensing power spectra , and the cross - covariance between the two observables .",
    "the detailed derivations of the covariances are presented in appendix . in   [ results ]",
    "we first study the total signal - to - noise ratios expected for a joint experiment of the cluster counts and the lensing power spectrum fully including the cross - covariance predicted from the @xmath4cdm cosmologies .",
    "we then present forecasts for cosmological parameter determination for the joint experiment , with particular focus on forecasts for the dark energy parameter constraints . finally , we present conclusions and discussion in ",
    "[ discuss ] .",
    "we work in the context of spatially flat cold dark matter models for structure formation .",
    "the expansion history of the universe is given by the scale factor @xmath5 in a homogeneous and isotropic universe ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "we describe the universe in terms of the matter density @xmath6 ( the cold dark matter plus the baryons ) and dark energy density @xmath7 at present ( in units of the critical density @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the hubble parameter at present ) . in general the expansion rate , the hubble parameter ,",

    "next we need the redshift growth of density perturbations . in linear theory after matter - radiation equality , all fourier modes of the mass density perturbation , @xmath22 , grow at the same rate , the growth rate ( e.g. see eq .  10 in @xcite for details ) .",
    "the galaxy cluster observables we will consider in this paper are the number counts drawn from a given survey region .",
    "clusters can be found via their notable observational properties such as gravitational lensing , member galaxies , x - ray emission and the sz effect . for number counts we simply treat clusters as points",
    "; in other words , we do not care about the distribution of mass within a cluster .",

    "a lensing measurement allows one to make a reconstruction of the two - dimensional mass distribution projected along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "a high peak in the mass map provides a strong candidate for a massive cluster ( see @xcite for an implementation of this method to actual data ) . to be more explicit",
    ", one can define height or significance for each peak in the reconstructed mass map using the _ effective _ signal - to - noise ratio ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the convergence amplitude due to a given cluster at redshift @xmath23 and with mass @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the rms fluctuations in @xmath33 due to the intrinsic ellipticity noise arising from a finite number of the background galaxies .",

    "this accounts for the variation of mean redshift and number density of the background galaxies with cluster redshift , which changes both the signal and the intrinsic noise in eq .",

    "we will employ the halo model to quantify the statistical properties of cluster observables . in the halo model approach",
    ", we assume that all the matter is in halos . following the formulation developed in @xcite ( also see appendix  [ app : cluster ] and @xcite for a thorough review ) , the ensemble average of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ncl ] ) can be computed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the halo mass function corresponding to the redshift considered and we have used the ensemble average @xmath40 . thus ,",
    "as expected , the ensemble average of the cluster number density field is given by the integral of the halo mass function , which does not depend on the cluster distribution and spatial position .",
    "for the halo mass function , we employ the sheth - tormen fitting formula @xcite , modified from the original press - schechter function @xcite .",
    "note that we use parameter values @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the formula following the discussion in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the mass function can be applied to dark energy cosmologies by replacing the growth rate appearing in the formula with that for a dark energy model @xcite .",
    "a more useful quantity often considered in the literature is the total number counts of clusters available from a given survey , which is obtained by integrating the three - dimensional number density field over a range of redshifts surveyed .",
    "cluster redshifts are rather easily available even from a multicolor imaging survey alone because their central bright galaxies , or red sequence galaxies , have secure photometric redshift estimates .",
    "having these facts in mind we will use as our observable the angular number density averaged over a survey area and divided into redshift bins : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the window function of the survey defined so that it is normalized as @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the distance to the hubble horizon , and the comoving volume per unit comoving distance and unit steradian is given by @xmath47 for a flat universe .",
    "the subscript in the round bracket , @xmath48 , stands for the @xmath49-th redshift bin for the cluster number counts . in the following",
    ", we will simply consider the sharp redshift selection function @xmath50 note that the redshift @xmath23 appearing in the argument of @xmath51 is related to the comoving distance @xmath52 via the relation @xmath53 .",
    "using the halo model , the expectation value of the angular number density can be computed from the ensemble average of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : angcl ] ) as @xmath54 thus , the expectation value again does not depend on the cluster distribution .",

    "[ fig : dndz - wl ] we present the number density for the lensing - based cluster sample in which clusters having a lensing signal greater than a given detection threshold are included in the sample as discussed around eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sel - wlsn ] ) .",
    "note that to compute the results shown in this plot we assumed the redshift distribution of galaxies described in   [ survey ] and the nfw mass profile to model the cluster lensing . in practice",
    "high detection thresholds such as @xmath60 are necessary in order to make robust estimates for cluster counts , because contamination of false peaks due to intrinsic ellipticities or the projection effect are expected to be low for such high thresholds ( see @xcite for the details ) . comparing with the number density for a mass - selected sample shown by the dot - dashed curves , one can roughly find which mass and redshift ranges of clusters are probed by the lensing - based cluster sample .",
    "for example , the cluster sample with lensing signal @xmath61 contains massive clusters with masses @xmath62 over redshift ranges @xmath63 , while only even more massive clusters are included in the sample at the higher redshifts .",
    "this cluster sample has a narrower redshift coverage than the simple mass threshold ; all the curves peak at a redshift @xmath64 .",
    "the peak redshift is mainly attributed to redshift dependence of the lensing efficiency for source galaxies of @xmath65 in our redshift distribution .",
    "a change of @xmath66 from @xmath67 to @xmath68 leads to a decrease in the number density , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndz ] . as before the effect comes partially arises from the decrease in comoving volume and the change in the halo mass function . unlike the simple mass threshold case",
    ", there is now an additional contribution to the decrease in number density caused by the lower lensing efficiency and thus lower @xmath69 for a cluster of a given mass and redshift .",
    "gravitational shear can be simply related to the lensing convergence : the weighted mass distribution integrated along the line of sight .",
    "photometric redshift information on source galaxies allows us to subdivide galaxies into redshift bins ( we will discuss possible effects of photometric redshift errors on our results in   [ sys ] ) .",
    "this allows more cosmological information to be extracted , which is referred to as lensing tomography ( e.g. , see @xcite for a thorough review , and see @xcite for the details of lensing tomography ) .    in the context of cosmological gravitational lensing",
    "the convergence field with tomographic information is expressed as a weighted projection of the three - dimensional mass density fluctuation field : @xmath70 , \\label{eqn : kappa}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the angular position on the sky , and @xmath72 is the gravitational lensing weight function for source galaxies sitting in the @xmath26-th redshift bin ( see eq .  (",
    "10 ) in @xcite for the definition ) .",
    "note that , hereafter , quantities with subscripts in the round bracket such as @xmath73 stands for those for the @xmath26-th redshift bin . to avoid confusion , throughout this paper we use @xmath74 or @xmath75 for the lensing power spectrum redshift bins , and @xmath76 for the cluster count redshift bins .",
    "the lensing tomographic information allows us to extract redshift evolution of the lensing weight function as well as the growth rate of mass clustering .",
    "these are both sensitive to dark energy .",
    "for example , increasing the equation of state parameter @xmath77 from @xmath15 lowers @xmath72 as well as suppressing the growth rate at lower redshifts .",
    "therefore when the cmb normalization of density perturbations is employed , an increase in @xmath77 decreases the lensing power spectrum due to both the lower @xmath72 and the lower matter power spectrum amplitude .",
    "the sensitivity of lensing observables to the dark energy equation of state roughly arises equally from the two effects ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the cosmic shear fields are measurable only in a statistical way .",
    "the most conventional methods used in the literature are the shear two - point correlation function .",
    "the fourier transformed counterpart is the shear power spectrum .",
    "the convergence power spectrum is identical to the shear power spectrum but is easier to work with as it is a scalar . using the flat - sky approximation @xcite , the angular power spectrum between the convergence fields of redshift bins @xmath26 and @xmath78 is found to be @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the three - dimensional mass power spectrum .",
    "we can safely employ the flat - sky approximation for our purpose , because a most accurate measurement for the lensing power spectrum is available around multipoles @xmath81 for a ground - based survey of our interest ( e.g. see fig .  1 in @xcite ) , and the flat - sky approximation serves as a very good approximation on these small scales @xcite .    for @xmath82",
    "the major contribution to @xmath83 comes from non - linear clustering ( e.g. , see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "we employ the fitting formula for the non - linear @xmath80 proposed in smith et al .",
    "@xcite , assuming that it can be applied to dark energy cosmologies by replacing the growth rate used in the formula with that for a given dark energy model .",
    "we note in passing that the issue of accurate power spectra for general dark energy cosmologies still needs to be addressed carefully ( see @xcite for related discussion ) .",
    "[ fig : cl ] demonstrates how lensing of background galaxies by clusters contributes to the lensing power spectrum .",
    "note here that we have employed the halo model developed in takada & jain @xcite to compute the mass power spectrum , although we will use the smith et al . fitting formula to compute the lensing power spectrum in most parts of this paper instead .",
    "briefly , to compute the spectra based on the halo model approach , we need to model three ingredients : ( i ) the halo mass function ( see also the description below eq .",
    "[ [ eqn:3dcl ] ] ) ; ( ii ) the profile for the mass distribution around a halo ; and ( iii ) the halo bias parameter .",
    "it is clear that the convergence on scales @xmath82 is significantly boosted by the existence of non - linear structures , halos . in this paper",
    "we are especially interested in using the lensing information inherent in angular scales @xmath84 , more complex uncertainties in non - linear clustering such as the baryonic effects arise , which need to be addressed more carefully . ] to constrain dark energy , and a fair fraction of the power at scales @xmath0 , up to @xmath85 of the total power , arises from massive halos with @xmath1 .",
    "the 1-halo term contribution is given by redshift - space integral of the halo mass function and halo profiles weighted with the lensing efficiency .",
    "the results imply that , if massive clusters with @xmath1 happen to be less or more populated in a survey region , amplitudes of the observed lensing power spectrum from the survey are very likely to be smaller or greater than expected , respectively .",
    "therefore , a cross - correlation between the lensing power spectrum and the cluster counts are intuitively expected , if both of the observables are measured from the same survey region .    in reality",
    ", the observed power spectrum is contaminated by the intrinsic ellipticity noise .",
    "assuming that the intrinsic ellipticity distribution is uncorrelated between different galaxies , the observed power spectrum between redshift bins @xmath26 and @xmath78 can be expressed as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the rms of intrinsic ellipticities per component , and @xmath88 denotes the average number density of galaxies in the @xmath26-th redshift bin .",
    "the kronecker delta function , @xmath89 , accounts for the fact that the cross - spectra of different redshift bins ( @xmath90 ) are not affected by the shot noise contamination .",
    "we will omit the superscript ` obs ' when referring to @xmath91 in the following for notational simplicity .",

    "as we have carefully investigated , the cross - covariance predicted from a cdm model quantifies how the cluster counts and the lensing power spectrum amplitude are correlated with each other in redshift and multipole space . the _ positive _ cross - correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cov ] implies that for a given survey region , if the number of clusters probed happens to be higher or lower than the ensemble average , the lensing power spectrum will be expected to have larger or smaller amplitudes , respectively .",
    "therefore , such a correlated offset in the two observables makes it difficult to determine their true amplitudes compared to the case in which the two observables are independent , thereby degrading the errors of parameters that are primarily sensitive to the amplitudes of the two observables .",
    "this explains the degradation in the errors on @xmath7 and @xmath230 for some range of mass thresholds . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlated offset rather preserves _ relative _ values between the cluster counts and the lensing spectrum amplitudes in redshift and multipole space .",
    "that is , a priori knowledge on the cross - covariance leads to an improvement in the errors on parameters that imprint characteristic redshift and multipole dependences onto the cluster counts and the lensing power spectrum .",
    "this is the case for the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath219 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : halom - ellipse ] we show the projected 68% c.l .",
    "error ellipses in the dark energy parameter space , for one particular example mass threshold , @xmath238 .",
    "the error ellipses in a two - parameter subspace highlight how the two parameters considered are degenerate for a given observable and the degeneracies are broken by combining different observables .",
    "it can be seen that the lensing power spectrum tomography and the cluster counts have similar degeneracy directions in constraining the dark energy parameters . adding the cluster counts",
    "only slightly improves the parameter errors compared to the errors from the lensing tomography alone .",
    "the plot also shows that the cross - covariance has a negligible effect on the error ellipses .",
    "[ fig : errors - wlsn ] shows the results for the lensing - based cluster counts , as a function of the cluster lensing signal , where clusters having a lensing signal greater than a given threshold , @xmath239 , are included in the counts . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] , we consider @xmath227 redshift bins for the cluster counts over redshifts @xmath240 and @xmath241 redshift bins for the lensing tomography .",
    "note that the plotting range of @xmath204-axis in the upper panel of each plot is same as that in fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] , while the plotting range in the lower panel is different .",
    "first of all , it should be noted that adding the lensing - based cluster counts into the lensing tomography does tighten the errors on @xmath7 , @xmath66 and @xmath219 significantly even though the cluster counts include fewer clusters than the mass - selected counts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dndz - wl ] ) . for the threshold @xmath242 , which includes clusters with masses @xmath62 and mainly covers a narrow redshift range of @xmath243 , the cluster counts still improve the dark energy parameters by @xmath244 , in contrast with only @xmath245 improvement for the mass - selected cluster counts with @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] .",
    "we find the same percentage improvement when the cmb priors are not included .",
    "with the reasonable value of @xmath246 the uncertainties are halved by adding cluster counts to lensing power spectra .",
    "the relatively amplified sensitivity to dark energy is attributed to the fact that the cluster lensing signal itself depends on the dark energy parameters via the lensing efficiency , even for a fixed halo mass ( see eq .  [ [ eqn : cluster - wl ] ] ) .    for the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath230 ,",
    "adding the cluster counts does not improve the error much , compared to the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath230 does not affect the amount of lensing for a given cluster so the poorer accuracy just arises from larger statistical errors due to the smaller number of clusters , compared to the mass - selected counts .    as shown in the lower panel of each plot , the cross - covariance has more influence on the parameter forecasts , compared to fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] . this is because lensing - based cluster counts and lensing tomography both pick up halos over a very similar range in redshifts .",
    "therefore there are more significant cross - correlations between the two observables . however , the effect of the cross - covariances on the parameter errors is small , by less than @xmath199 , for @xmath60 .",
    "[ fig : wlsn - ellipse ] shows the marginalized error ellipses , for the lensing - signal detection threshold @xmath247 .",
    "the degeneracy directions in dark energy parameter constraints are very similar between the cluster counts and the lensing tomography . compared to fig .",
    "[ fig : halom - ellipse ] , the lensing - based cluster counts have a better accuracy of constraining the dark energy parameters , thereby leading the error ellipses to more shrink when the cluster counts and the lensing tomography combined .",
    "this can be explained because the contours in the dark energy equation of state parameter space is just a projection of the full 9d space .",
    "we have investigated eigendirections in cosmological parameter space and identified differences between cluster counts and lensing for @xmath230 and @xmath248 ( effectively @xmath249 given that @xmath250 is a parameter in the fisher matrix ) . for example , we find that if we plot @xmath66 against @xmath230 then we see that the cluster counts plus cmb contours are more aligned with the @xmath66 axis whereas the lensing plus cmb contours are more aligned with the @xmath230 axis . when combined together , both degeneracies are broken and the error bar on @xmath66 is reduced . similarly for @xmath230 and @xmath219 and @xmath248 with each dark energy parameter .",
    "this explains why the combined contours ( cluster counts plus lensing plus cmb ) are smaller than either separate contour ( cluster counts plus cmb or lensing plus cmb ) , even though the separate constraints have the same degeneracy directions when projected down onto @xmath66 versus @xmath219 space .",

    "there is a mild improvement in both the error on @xmath254 and @xmath219 when adding cluster counts to lensing tomography . for the lensing selected clusters case ,",
    "the improvement is mostly in @xmath219 .",
    "we have considered idealized cases : we have ignored possible systematic errors involved in both the cluster counts and the lensing power spectrum measurement for simplicity . in this subsection , we present some discussion of possible effects of the ignored systematic errors on our results .    an imperfect knowledge of galaxy redshifts inferred from multi - band imaging data ( photometric redshifts hereafter simply photo-@xmath23 ) could affect both measurements of cosmic shear and cluster counts . for cosmic shear , statistical errors in photo-@xmath23s",
    "are unlikely to be a dominant source of the error budget of cosmic shear measurement , if they are well characterized @xcite .",
    "this is because gravitational lensing has a broad redshift sensitivity function .",
    "as carefully investigated in @xcite , the dominant source of the systematic error is rather caused by mean bias in photo-@xmath23s , causing mean redshifts of the tomographic bins to be shifted relative to the true mean redshifts .",
    "for planned future surveys , the mean redshifts need to be known to better than a few tenths of a percent accuracy in redshift in order to avoid much degradation in cosmological parameter errors . to achieve this requirement ,",
    "a large representative spectroscopic redshift sub - sample of the full set of galaxies used for lensing may be needed to calibrate / correct photo-@xmath23 errors .    for cluster counts ,",
    "photo-@xmath23 errors cause uncertainties in redshift estimates of individual clusters and in addition cause uncertainties in the lensing signal of individual clusters , if a lensing - based cluster catalog is used . for the lensing signal",
    ", the requirements on photo-@xmath23 accuracy would be similar to that for cosmic shear , as discussed in the previous paragraph . to estimate the redshift of a cluster using photo-@xmath23s",
    ", we often have old red - sequence galaxies for which good photo-@xmath23s are easier to obtain due to a strong 4,000@xmath259 break ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "further , the redshift of the cluster is an average over the redshifts of the cluster members , thus reducing the uncertainty yet further .",
    "in addition , since clusters are relatively rare objects it would not be very expensive to perform follow - up spectroscopy on a central bright galaxy or some member galaxies .",
    "these high - quality redshifts would allow much finer redshift binning of the cluster distribution than redshift bins of the cosmic shear tomography . then , taking the cross - correlation between the clusters with _ known _ redshifts and a fair sub - sample of the galaxies used for the cosmic shear tomography may be used to calibrate the photo-@xmath23 errors , because the cross - correlation is non - vanishing only if the source galaxies are physically associated with the clusters ( see @xcite for the related discussion ) .",
    "this issue would be worth exploring further , and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "intrinsic alignments of galaxy ellipticities are another potential source of systematic errors for cosmic shear measurement ( see @xcite for the detail and references therein ) .",
    "there are two kinds of the contamination .",
    "the first is intrinsic - intrinsic galaxy alignment ( ii ) that may arise from neighboring galaxies residing in a similar tidal field of large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "the second effect is a cross - correlation between intrinsic ellipticity of a foreground galaxy and lensing distortion of background galaxy shape ( gi ) because the foreground tidal field affecting the intrinsic ellipticity of a foreground galaxy may also cause lensing shear of a distant , background galaxy ( @xcite ) . in general member galaxies of a cluster",
    "tend to be more elliptical and therefore the width of the ellipticity histogram ( intrinsic ellipticity dispersion ) will be smaller for cluster members due to the absence of e.g. edge - on spirals .",
    "therefore if there are by chance more clusters in a surveyed area then the noise on the shear power spectrum will be slightly smaller .",
    "this is likely a tiny effect and can be safely neglected .",
    "another interesting possibility is that if there are many clusters in a surveyed area then both the ii and gi contamination to the cosmic shear power spectra would be larger , since member galaxies of a cluster are more aligned with each other .",
    "also the stronger tidal field due to the cluster may also cause the cluster members to be more anti - aligned with background galaxy shapes due to lensing distortion by the cluster .",
    "however , identifying clusters within a given survey region could be a useful way to remove / correct this ii and gi contamination , which is another interesting possibility of the combined cluster counts and cosmic shear to use for future surveys .    for cluster counts ,",
    "a most problematic source of the systematic errors is the uncertainty in relating cluster observables to halo mass .",
    "one traditional way to tackle this obstacle is to investigate properties of known massive clusters in great detail combing various techniques ( radio , optical , cluster lensing , x - ray and the sz effect ) . or one might develop a reliable model for the mass - observable relation using hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation fully taking into account the associated physical processes in the intracluster medium",
    ". then the mass - observable relation obtained in these ways could be used for cluster counting statistics if the derived relation is a fair representation of the mass - observable distribution of clusters in the sample .    for lensing - based cluster counts ,",
    "projection effects on a cluster lensing signal due to mass along line - of - sight that is not associated with the cluster introduce additional statistical errors in the mass estimates of individual clusters @xcite .",
    "in addition , the scatter will be correlated with the cosmic shear power spectrum , which we have also not taken into account . to estimate the mass estimate uncertainty and the effect of the ignored correlation in a quantitative way , ray - tracing simulations of cosmic shear including cluster lensing contributions will be needed .",
    "also in practice traditional methods ( optical , x - ray , the sz effect ) will need to be combined to exclude false clusters from the sample .",
    "these issues are beyond the scope of this paper",
    ".    one may develop a model to describe the mass - observable relation in terms of nuisance parameters .",
    "then we could use cluster observables available from a given survey to ` self - calibrate ' , i.e. determine both the cosmological parameters and the nuisance parameters concurrently .",
    "in particular , it was shown in @xcite that adding the two - point correlation function of clusters to cluster counts , both of which are drawn from the same survey region , can be a useful way to self - calibrate the model systematic errors in the mass - observable relation because the amplitude of the cluster two - point function is very sensitive to halo bias that is fairly well specified by halo masses .",
    "having the discussion above in mind , it would be interesting to address whether the self - calibration regime could be attained for the combined measurements of cluster counts and cosmic shear tomography , taking into account the effects of systematic errors involved in each observable .",
    "the cluster counts and cosmic shear depend on the cosmological parameters in different ways and are sensitive to different systematic errors . hence one can use the combined measurement to constrain simultaneously the cosmological parameters as well as the nuisance parameters of systematic errors , mitigating degradation in the cosmological parameter determination due to the systematic errors . also importantly one could realize , for a given survey , the requirements on the control of the systematic errors ( photo-@xmath23 , mass - observable relation etc ) to attain the desired accuracy of constraining dark energy parameters . in this direction , the cross - covariances between the cluster counts and cosmic shear tomography may play an intriguing role , because ( 1 ) the cross - correlations are cosmological signals arising from the cosmic mass density field in large - scale structures or , in other words , there is in general little cross - correlation between the systematic errors in the two observables , and ( 2 ) a cdm structure formation model provides accurate predictions for the cosmological cross - covariances . hence including the cross - covariances in the parameter estimations",
    "may be used as another viable monitor of the systematic errors .",
    "this interesting issue is beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in this paper we have estimated accuracies on cosmological parameters derivable from a joint experiment of cluster counts and cosmic shear power spectrum tomography when the two are drawn from the same survey region . in doing this",
    "we have properly taken into account the cross - covariance between the two observables , which describes how the two observables are correlated in redshift and multipole space .",
    "this is necessary because the two experiments probe the same cosmic density fields .",
    "however note that , since we have ignored possible systematic errors , all the results shown in this paper demonstrate pure cosmological powers for the combined method .",
    "we will below summarize our findings , and then will discuss the remaining issues .",
    "we have developed a formulation to compute the cross - covariance between the cluster counts and the cosmic shear power spectra based on the dark matter halo approach within the framework of a cdm structure formation model ( see appendix ) .",
    "the cross - covariance arises from the three - point correlation function between the cluster distribution and two points of the mass density fields .",
    "it is found that there is a significant _ positive _ cross - correlation between the cluster counts probing clusters with masses @xmath1 and the lensing power spectrum amplitudes at multipoles @xmath260 . here",
    "the term ` positive ' is used to mean that if fewer or more massive clusters are found from a given survey region than the ensemble average , the lensing power spectra will most likely have smaller or larger amplitudes , respectively .",
    "the cross - correlation on angular and mass scales of interest arises mainly from the 1-halo term contribution of the three - point correlations : the correlation between one point within a given cluster and the shearing effects on two different background galaxies due to the same cluster .",
    "our results are more accurate than the earlier work presented in @xcite , because their work ignored the 1-halo term contribution to the cross - covariance and only included the 2-halo term contribution , which is dominant only on large angular scales where the useful cosmological information can not be extracted .    to quantify the impact of the cross - covariance , we first investigated the total signal - to - noise ( @xmath69 ) ratios for a joint measurement of the cluster counts and the lensing power spectrum .",
    "it was shown that an inclusion of the cross - covariance leads to degradation and , depending on the mass thresholds or the lensing detection thresholds , improvement in the @xmath69 ratios up to @xmath261 compared to the case that the two observable are considered to be independent ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : sn ] and [ fig : sn - wlsn ] ) .",
    "the improvement occurs when the cluster counts including massive halos @xmath62 are combined with the lensing power spectrum measurement ( also see @xcite for the related discussion ) .",
    "this occurs even though the @xmath69 ratio for the cluster counts alone is much less than that for the lensing power spectrum alone .",
    "that is , a knowledge of the number of such massive clusters for a given survey region helps improve accuracies of the joint measurement .",
    "this improvement is achievable only if the cross - covariance is _ a priori _ known by using the theoretical predictions or by directly estimating the cross - correlation from the survey region .",
    "we also note that the results change greatly if we ignore the non - gaussian error contribution to the lensing power spectrum covariance , which arises from the lensing trispectrum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sn_1halo ] ) .",
    "this implies that the lensing fields are highly non - gaussian ( see @xcite for an extensive discussion ) .",
    "we then presented forecasts for accuracies of the cosmological parameter determination for the joint experiment . to do this",
    "we included redshift binning for both the cluster counts and the lensing power spectrum , motivated by the fact that the additional redshift information is very useful to tighten the cosmological parameter constraints , especially the dark energy parameters . in this paper we considered two simplified cluster selection criteria : one is a mass - selected cluster sample , and the other is the lensing - based cluster sample , where the latter contains clusters having the lensing signal greater than a given threshold in the sample . for the mass - selected cluster counts , it was found that combining the cluster counts and the lensing tomography leads to significant improvement in the errors on the dark energy parameters by @xmath231 only if the cluster counts including down to less massive halos such as @xmath1 are considered ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] ) .",
    "the improvement is due to different dependence of the two observables on the cosmological parameters .    on the other hand , for the lensing - based cluster counts , adding the cluster counts to the lensing power spectrum tomography is more complementary to tighten the errors on the dark energy parameters than the mass - selected cluster counts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : errors - wlsn ] ) .",
    "for example , adding the counts of clusters with the high lensing signals @xmath60 improves the dark energy errors by a factor of 2 , even though the counts contain many fewer clusters and probe a narrower redshift range than the mass - selected clusters of @xmath262 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dndz - wl ] ) .",
    "this result is encouraging because such massive halos are rare and therefore it seems relatively easy to make follow - up observations , e.g. , in order to obtain well - calibrated relations between cluster mass and observables ( also see   [ sys ] for the discussion ) .",
    "the reason lensing - based cluster counts are more powerful is ascribed to the fact that the cluster lensing signal itself depends on the cosmological parameters via the lensing efficiency and the dependence amplifies the sensitivity of the cluster counts to the dark energy parameters . however , with low detection thresholds such as @xmath263 the lensing - based counts begin to suffer too much from projection effects due to large - scale structures that are not associated with the cluster . hence ,",
    "if traditional mass - selected cluster counts can go to lower masses then they might catch up with , or overtake , the lensing - based counts in their constraining power .    for the impact of the cross - covariance on the parameter determination , the effect is generally small for both the mass - selected and lensing - based cluster counts .",
    "this is partly because the lensing power spectra are sensitive to the total number of clusters _ roughly weighted by the cluster mass squared _ whereas for the cluster counts we simply added up the number of clusters ( see appendix  [ appendix : toy - wl ] ) .",
    "this means that the two probes are not measuring such a similar quantity and the cross - covariance is smaller than if they both measured the unweighted total number of clusters .",
    "further , the redshift weighting is different for the lensing power spectra and the cluster counts , so not all the halos are in common .",
    "it is also partly a result of working in multi - dimensional parameter space ( 9 parameters for our case ) .",
    "yet , it is intriguing to note that the dark energy parameters are in most cases improved by including the cross - covariance ( see the lower panels of each plot in figs .",
    "[ fig : errors ] and [ fig : errors - wlsn ] ; also see @xcite for the related discussion ) . in summary ,",
    "a joint experiment of cluster counts and lensing power spectrum tomography will be worth exploring in order to exploit full information on the cosmological parameters from future massive surveys , and including the cross - covariance will be needed in order to correctly estimate the error bars .",
    "in this work we have assumed that cluster counts measure the total number of clusters above some threshold , in a number of redshift bins . in principle subdividing cluster counts in mass or lensing signal bins could also improve cosmological parameter constraints @xcite .",
    "this would make the improvement on including cluster counts to lensing power spectra even more impressive , however the covariance may be more important than we find in this paper .    finally , we comment on a possibility for ultimate experiments combining all observables available from one survey region .",
    "as we have shown , one can combine different observables to improve accuracies of the cosmological parameter determination , even though the observables probe the _ same _ cosmic density fields .",
    "besides the cluster counts and the lensing power spectrum considered in this paper , there will be other various observables available : cosmic shear bispectra or more generally @xmath264-point correlation functions of the cosmic shear fields @xcite , @xmath264-point correlation functions of cluster and galaxy distributions @xcite , small - scale cluster lensing signals @xcite , cosmic flexion correlation functions @xcite and so on .",
    "then , one natural question raises : can we combine all the observables in order to improve the parameter constraints as much as possible ? or",
    ", in the presence of the systematic errors , is there an optimal combination of the observables to maximize the parameter constraints as well as most mitigate degradation in the parameter constraints due the systematic errors .",
    "however , to address this interesting issue quantitatively , all the covariances between the observables used have to be correctly taken into account .",
    "we believe that the formulation developed in this paper would be useful to compute the covariances for any observables and the combinations .",
    "this kinds of study will be worthwhile exploring in order to exploit the full potential of future expensive surveys for constraining the nature of mysterious dark energy components and possible modifications of gravity .",
