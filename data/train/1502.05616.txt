    "to minimize them , i participated in the ssg meetings but did not try to influence the choice of science goals , except to calculate their technical implications .",

    "the present `` an analysis of the vlass proposal '' update those notes to address the `` final '' vlass proposal @xcite .",
    "the vlass is so different from earlier surveys that a careful and quantitative analysis is needed to show it can meet its many different and sometimes incompatible science goals . in particular , high angular resolution and high completeness of flux - limited source samples do nt mix .",

    "the _ wide bandwidth coverage _ ( 2 to @xmath39 ) enables instantaneous spectral - index determination in principle , but in practice it is useful only for very strong , compact sources because ( 1 ) the in - band @xmath40 is so vulnerable to noise errors that a signal - to - noise ratio snr @xmath41 is required to reach @xmath42 , and ( 2 ) the spectral indices of extended sources are biased steep because the synthesized beam solid angle falls by @xmath43 across the band ( section  [ alphasec ] ) .",
    "the relatively high vlass center frequency ( about twice the 1.4  ghz of most competing surveys ) allows for higher angular resolution , reduces faraday depolarization , and helps to protect the all - sky snapshot images from being dynamic - range limited .",

    "part of the problem for the 3  ghz all - sky is that pulsars have much steeper radio spectra ( @xmath435 ) than most radio sources ( @xmath366 ) , so high - frequency surveys have low needle / haystack ratios .",

    "_ detecting _ radio stars in our galaxy is fairly easy , but reliably _ identifying _ them ( section  [ idcrsec ] ) requires extremely accurate positions because the fraction @xmath436 of all radio sources that are powered by stars is very small ( @xmath437 ) .",
    "all - sky really should greatly improve on existing flux - limit samples of radio stars , even though it is not much more sensitive than first or nvss , because its high angular resolution allows it measure accurate ( @xmath438 in each coordinate ) positions of even the faintest detectable point sources .",
    "it has little competition from first , which does not cover the galactic plane , from the nvss , whose position errors are too large , or possibly even from emu , which may be confusion limited near the galactic center . more weight should have been given to this part of the all - sky proposal .",

    "all - sky was forced to such high angular resolution by the claim in section  4.1.1 and appendix d of @xcite that @xmath450% reliable position - coincidence identifications with optically faint galaxies can be made if and only if @xmath66 is very small , regardless of source signal - to - noise ratio s / n . that claim is based on a bad identification method that tries to match the individual components of a resolved double source , instead of the source centroid , with its host optical galaxy .",

    "the vlass must have a strong justification for its request for about 9,000 hours of valuable time on the new jvla .",
    "it needs to be justified as ( 1 ) being technically better ( e.g. , more sensitive , higher position accuracy ,  ) than other surveys and ( 2 ) having a higher `` reach '' or impact than the regular proposals it would displace on the vla schedule .",
    "read the `` report of the nrao large proposals committee '' @xcite of the committee created specifically to address the competition between large surveys and smaller pi observations , especially their recommendation 7 `` the nrao should not make announcements of opportunity for the submission of large proposals .",
    "large proposals should be submitted at the normal proposal deadlines , without special solicitation by the observatory . ''",
    "the reasoning behind that recommendation @xcite is ( emphases added ) :     the committee considered whether the nrao should explicitly solicit proposals for large projects via announcements of opportunity , targeted either to specific disciplines or to special deadlines ( other than those of the regular proposal process . )     it was our unanimous opinion that this would be undesirable .",
    "it would separate `` opportunities '' for proposing large projects from the regular proposal process , whereas we see merit in keeping the processes for large and small proposals well - coupled . _",
    "it is also hard to see what benefit would come by encouraging the whole user community to think about large proposals simultaneously . _     the nrao - operated telescopes are ground - based and flexible in their capabilities , so operational and planning considerations differ greatly from those needed to establish the scientific program of space - borne instruments , for example . _",
    "the ao approach would however place some obligation on the nrao to schedule some large projects after a period in which it had encouraged the whole user community to make proposals for them .",
    "_    `` it is particularly undesirable to create an artificial imbalance between the pressures for large and regular proposals when our ultimate goal is to find an appropriate balance . _",
    "we believe that balance is more likely to be achieved through a proposal process that is driven mainly by the scientific interests of individual investigators , rather than through one driven by ad hoc deadlines_. ''      first and nvss are prototypes for the all - sky survey .",
    "they were justified primarily on the basis of their orders - of - magnitude technical superiority over previous large - scale sky surveys , and not on any specific `` transformational science '' ( the 20th century term for today s `` killer app '' ) they would accomplish .",
    "rather , the bulk of the science would be done by community users who would come up with new ideas to exploit the greatly improved survey data  build a better mousetrap , and the world will beat a path to your door .",
    "the original first paper @xcite could legitimately claim that `` first represents a factor of @xmath453 improvement in limiting sensitivity over the best available sky survey at any radio wavelength '' and `` more importantly , however , first also represents a factor of 50 improvement in angular resolution and concomitant positional accuracy . '' of course , to be valuable to the general scientific community , it also has to cover a large part of the sky ; first would be `` in short , the radio equivalent of the palomar sky survey for 25% of the celestial sphere . ''",
    "similarly , the primary selling point for the emu ( extragalactic map of the universe ) survey covering the sky south of @xmath21 ( 75% of the celestial sphere ) with @xmath454 rms noise and @xmath24 resolution was that `` emu has the potential to have the enormous impact that the nvss had a decade ago , but at a factor of 40 better in sensitivity and 5 in angular resolution . ''    unfortunately , all - sky is only @xmath455 as sensitive to point sources as first , and it is less sensitive to extended sources . neither all - sky nor deep have the surface - brightness sensitivity to detect the extended radio emission from most spiral galaxies .",
    "emu combines the best features of both first ( high point - source sensitivity and the angular resolution to identify weak sources with faint galaxies ) and nvss ( high surface - brightness sensitivity and nearly `` all sky '' coverage ) .",
    "the instantaneous sky coverage of emu ( @xmath456 ) beats all - sky by more than two orders - of - magnitude , so emu will be a superior finder of bright transients . finally , emu is likely to be completed at about the same time scale as the vlass ( 2023 ) because askap will become a dedicated survey telescope after the second - generation array feeds are installed .",
    "all of the second - generation feeds have now been funded for construction during the next two years , and the emu survey itself only needs two years for completion , compared with seven years for the vlass .",
    "it does nt matter which survey wins the race to completion by a year or two ; the impacts of large surveys like first and nvss , vlass and emu are felt on time scales of decades .    the deep survey _ is _ a better mousetrap for point sources , with @xmath457 and @xmath458 resolution , specifications that emu and wodan will never reach . deep covers only a tiny fraction of the sky ( @xmath459% of the sky ) , so it is analogous to the various `` deep '' surveys by hubble , chandra , and spitzer . if deep",
    "is done at 3  ghz with the a configuration , it will partially resolve most faint star - forming galaxies .",
    "this is good for studying the shear produced by weak gravitational lensing but bad for obtaining the complete samples of low - brightness sources needed for studying the evolution of star formation .",
    "equation  [ brtdeteq ] indicates that deep could detect most star - forming galaxies if its beamwidth were at least @xmath460 , which is possible with the b configuration at either 3 or 1.4  ghz .",
    "the high scientific impact of the very sensitive multi - band optical / ir hubble deep fields comes from the fact that they really are `` deep '' in the sense of detecting and distingiushing galaxies at very high redshifts .",
    "in contrast , the median redshift of radio sources is nearly independent of flux density , so more sensitive radio surveys like deep mainly detect @xmath461 sources with lower radio luminosities @xcite . also , there is no radio spectral signature that clearly distinguishes high - redshift sources .",
    "the most distant quasars may already be in the first and nvss catalogs , but we have to way to distinguish them from the millions of `` ordinary '' radio sources .",
    "high - redshift starburst galaxies stand out only at sub - mm wavelengths , where they appear frequently as background sources in alma images .",
    "a deep proposal for 3,000 + hours of jvla time to constrain the evolution of star formation out to @xmath461 or 2 needs strong and _ quantitative _ scientific and technical justifications .",
    "in particular , the angular resolution needs to be lowered and the `` prussian hat '' vlass wedding cake ( figure  [ cakefig ] ) needs more layers to optimize coverage in that part of the the redshift - luminosity plane containing the galaxies responsible for the bulk of star formation .",
    "appendix a.2 of @xcite and appendix b.2 of @xcite use the citation rates of the first survey paper @xcite , the first catalog paper @xcite , and the nvss paper @xcite to estimate the scientific impact of future large surveys like all - sky .",
    "the ads citation histories of these papers as of 2014 september 23 are shown in figure  [ citesfig ] .",
    "although these publications are now 16 to 19 years old , their citation rates remain steady or slowly growing , and their combined refereed citation rate is about @xmath462 per year .",
    "no competitive surveys have been published , so their lifetime refereed citation numbers have grown to 1211 , 552 , and 2466 , respectively , for a total of 4229 when all three papers are added up .",
    "the take - home lesson from figure  [ citesfig ] is that large surveys should be designed for the long run , and surveys that are surpassed after only a few years will have much less impact .",
    "it makes no sense to rush the vlass in order to `` scoop '' emu , only to have it surpassed shortly after it is completed .",
    "how does the citation impact of nvss+first compare with the regular vla projects that these surveys displaced ?",
    "together these two surveys used up about 6,000 hours , or one year of vla observing time , so their citation numbers should be compared with the citation numbers of papers produced by one year of `` regular '' vla projects .",
    "appendix a.2 of @xcite compared the number of refereed vla papers published per year ( 192 ) with the number of refereed citations per year of first and/or nvss ( 262 ) and concluded `` thus , there is very strong evidence against the argument that the science out of the vla is negatively impacted when surveys displace regular proposals . ''",
    "i think this is comparing apples ( number of refereed vla papers _ published _ per year ) and oranges ( number of refereed papers _ citing _ first and/or nvss data per year ) .",
    "the relevant comparison for the number of refereed papers citing first and/or nvss data per year is the number of refereed papers citing the 192 regular vla papers per year .",
    "for example , if the average number of citations per regular vla paper per year is 4 , the 192 regular vla papers from one year will result in 768 citations per year .",
    "even more relevant , and more favorable to first and nvss , is comparing the lifetime number of citations attributable to first / nvss ( 4229 ) with the lifetime number of citations attributable to the 192 regular vla papers resulting from one year of vla observing time .",
    "i checked with marsha bishop , the nrao librarian , and the lifetime number of citations per vla paper published in the years 2007 - 9 is 34 , so the 192 regular vla papers should yield a lifetime number of citations about 6500 , which is still somewhat higher than the first / nvss 4229 .",
    "i conclude that citation rates , either per year or integrated over paper lifetime , do nt clearly favor first / nvss over small vla programs .",
    "the jvla today is in much heavier demand than the vla was 20 years ago , and the upgrade has helped targeted observations far more than it has helped surveys ( section  [ surveymetricssec ] ) , so the vlass will need a stronger justification than the citation counts presented in appendix a.2 of @xcite or appendix b of @xcite .",
    "there is a still - unresolved debate within the ssg ( or more specifically , between the ssg and me ) about the radio resolution needed to make optical identifications of radio sources with faint galaxies and quasars .",
    "see appendix d of @xcite for the latest version of the claim that 95% identification _ reliability _ requires a large search radius @xmath463 .",
    "this claim is based on a straw - man identification procedure that does not distinguish between radio _ components _ ( peaks on a radio image ) and radio _ sources _ ( the totality of radio emission from a galaxy ) .",
    "see @xcite , appendix d of @xcite , and this appendix for the current state of this debate .",
    "the identification question needs to be sorted out before the vlass design is frozen .",
    "also , the vlass proposal still needs to address the question of identification _ completeness _ , which decreases at high angular resolution , as the radio survey catalog completeness decreases .",
    "section 5.1.1 of @xcite states that resolution but not sensitivity is a key survey parameter : `` while sky area is one of the two key parameters that define the value of a wide - area radio survey , the other key parameter is resolution , as this allows counterparts to be identified at other wavelengths among the dense populations of faint galaxies . ''",
    "the reason seems to be the claim in @xcite appendix b that the proper identification search - circle radius is @xmath464 , regardless of ( s / n ) . the more sensitive emu and wodan surveys are dismissed as not having sufficient resolution ( @xmath465 and @xmath466 , respectively ) to make deep optical identifications :  for pan - starrs , a fwhm resolution better than @xmath467 is required for 95% reliability in radio - ps1 cross - matches , as demonstrated in figure 14 .",
    "that criterion is easily met by vlass , but with resolutions of @xmath465 and @xmath466 respectively ( fwhm ) , both askap - emu and wodan fall short ( figure 14 ) .",
    "thus , despite their excellent flux sensitivity , the forthcoming ska - precursor surveys will not have adequate spatial resolution for confident identifications of counterparts in pan - starrs . ``",
    "a recurring claim is that the excellent @xmath468jy rms flux sensitivity planned for the ska - precursor surveys ( wodan , askap - emu ) will lead to good positional accuracy for radio sources despite the relatively low resolution of those surveys .",
    "the evidence , however , suggests that this is incorrect  the positions of radio sources observed at low resolution do _ not _ actually converge to the optical counterpart position as ( s / n ) increases .",
    "the wrong conclusion is reached due to simplistic assumptions about the structure of radio sources . in appendix",
    "b we provide a detailed discussion and analysis ( i.e. , the `` s / n model of positional accuracy '' ) demonstrating that half of the optical counterparts to sdss depth will be false matches using the matching radius that will be required for wodan ( e.g. , see figure 14 ) .",
    "the false counterparts will obviously be an even problem for deeper optical surveys , such as the ongoing des and hsc surveys and eventually for lsst .",
    "thus the ska - precursor surveys can not be substituted for the vlass all - sky survey .",
    "this tier will have a long , useful , and heavily used lifetime even into the era of the ska - precursor surveys . ''",
    "( section 5.1.1 )    likewise for wide : `` at the limits of the des , hsc , and lsst surveys there are 5 , 8 , and 14 galaxies in an askap beam  never mind the number of stars .",
    "the higher s / n observations of emu / wodan will not mitigate this source density when it comes to associating optical and radio sources ( see the appendix ) , resulting in a high probability of misidentifications .",
    "b - array observations in the s - band provide sufficient resolution to bring these numbers down to @xmath469 galaxy in the vla beam without unnecessarily over - resolving extended radio sources . ''",
    "( section 5.2 )    this appendix b analysis of angular resolution and optical identifications has serious problems .",
    "it(1 ) sets up a straw - man `` s / n model '' that ignores calibration errors when calculating position errors , ( 2 ) knocks down the `` s / n model '' by introducing a faulty identification technique that seems to imply much larger `` empirical '' position errors , ( 3 ) incorrectly ascribes these large errors to source asymmetry , ( 4 ) claims that the identification search circle radius must be @xmath470 , regardless of s / n , ( 5 ) dismisses more sensitive but lower resolution surveys as being unable to identify even moderately bright optical objects ( e.g. , @xmath471 for emu , @xmath472 for wodan ) with 95% reliability , ( 6 ) emphasizes identification reliability @xmath473 but omits the equally important identification completeness @xmath474 that is degraded by high angular resolution , and ( 7 ) ignores the powerful and widely used likelihood - ratio method @xcite for improving on position - coincidence identifications .",
    "appendix b in @xcite presented the straw - man `` s / n model '' for positions errors and defines it by the rule : ``  as the flux density increases , the positional error will decrease as 1/(s / n ) , allowing the optical counterpart to be matched . specifically , the nvss description ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) gives this formula for the noise in ra or dec for point sources : @xmath475 here @xmath66 is the resolution fwhm ( @xmath476 for nvss ) and s / n is the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the median nvss rms noise for these matched sources is 0.47 mjy / beam .",
    "note that this noise equation already has been increased by an empirical factor of @xmath477 compared with the theoretical equation `` to adjust the errors into agreement with the more accurate first positions '' ( condon et al .",

    "equation ( 3 ) in @xcite appendix b ( equation  [ eqn : snmodelsigma1d ] here ) differs from equation  25 in @xcite because it confuses @xmath480 with @xmath409 in equation  25 .",
    "the value of @xmath409 for point sources given in equation  26 of @xcite is actually @xmath481 , so equation ( 3 ) overestimates @xmath482 by a factor of @xmath477 .",
    "equation ( 3 ) for the noise component of error should read @xmath483    although presented as `` a long - standing notion '' needing to be debunked , the straw man `` s / n model '' was first defined in appendix b. it is not a long - standing notion because it implies that the _ noise component _ of position error is the _ total _ position error used for identifying point sources . in the long - standing `` two component '' calculation of position errors , the noise component of position error does decrease as 1/(s / n ) @xcite , but it is always added quadratically to the calibration component of error , which is independent of ( s / n ) . for example , the actual nvss description @xcite is : `` the rms uncertainties ( @xmath360 , @xmath484 ) in the centroid coordinates ( @xmath40 , @xmath485 ) of any source with uncorrected peak amplitude @xmath486 can be approximated by quadratic sums of intensity - independent calibration uncertainties ( @xmath487 , @xmath488 ) and noiselike uncertainties that are inversely proportional to @xmath486 .

    "the failure of the `` s / n model '' to match the data points above @xmath491  jy in figure  [ plotnvsspos2fig ] is caused by its omission of intensity - independent calibration errors .      to visually fit the dense black band of data points in @xcite figure  [ plotnvsspos2fig ] , it is most appropriate to calculate @xmath492 , the 50% confidence radial separation between the measured and true positions . for gaussian - distributed 1d position errors with rms @xmath493 in each coordinate ,",

    "they have lobes , jets , cores ; star - forming galaxies have spiral arms ; and there can be confusion where multiple radio sources get mixed together in the low resolution beam .",
    "a low resolution survey does indeed provide a measurement , with high accuracy , of the mean flux - weighted position as the s / n increases .",
    "however , the flux - weighted centroid is often not where the optical counterpart lies . in many cases ,",
    "the counterpart is associated with some sharp structure within the radio source , and that structure may be far from the flux - weighted center . ''    my explanation is that the method used to generate the data points in figure  [ plotnvsspos2fig ] is a really bad way to match nvss sources with first sources and leads to bad matches with separations approaching @xmath523 that contaminate the first / nvss separation data .",
    "consequently the red 90% confidence `` empirical '' curve is not a useful indicator of radio - optical offsets and can not be used to calculate identification search radii for the nvss or , more importantly for the vlass proposal , for surveys that compete with it ( emu , wodan , and even first ) .",
    "how were the matches in figure  [ plotnvsspos2fig ] generated ?",

    "for all these @xmath525 sources , we computed the distance to the nearest nvss source .",
    "the important thing about this sample is that the first source matches the optical source position .",
    "that means that if nvss is to identify the same counterpart , it needs to have a position close to the first source position .",
    "there may be several first source components associated with a single nvss source , but only the first sources that match optical counterparts are included . ''    the sky density of first sources is @xmath526 @xcite and the sky density of nvss sources is @xmath527 @xcite , so @xmath528% of first sources have true nvss counterparts and @xmath529% of first sources do not . among these unmatched first sources ,",
    "those having no unrelated nvss neighbors within @xmath523 were dropped from the sample .",
    "all unmatched first sources having unrelated nvss neighbors within @xmath523 remain in the sample and appear as false identifications with nvss - first separations up to @xmath523 .",
    "the probability that an unrelated nvss source lies within @xmath523 of a random position on the sky is @xmath530 , so we expect about 124,000 good matches and 11,000 bad matches among the 135,000 plotted data points . with only 92% of the matches being good ,",
    "the `` empirical '' 90% confidence limit is bound to be too high .",
    "the `` bad sources '' problem was studied observationally by @xcite .",
    "he found that , even among strong extragalactic sources ( @xmath531 at 1.4  ghz ) , only about 30% would be significantly resolved ( @xmath532 ) by the nvss , and most extended sources are fairly symmetric . among all extended sources , symmetric or not , the offset of the source s _ flux - weighted centroid _ from the host galaxy was usually within 10% of the overall source extent and never more than 20% ( see his figure 8) .",
    "thus the optical identification of a @xmath533 source is likely to lie within @xmath377 and almost certainly within @xmath465 of the source centroid .",
    "any `` bad sources '' should contribute points centered on and concentrated close to the black band in figure  [ plotnvsspos2fig ] .",
    "very large first - nvss separations ( e.g. , @xmath534 ) should be _ extremely _ rare , and they would not normally be accepted as identifications in any case .",
    "in contrast , nvss `` bad matches '' should be randomly distributed over @xmath535 circles centered on the first sources , and they should contribute about 8% of the data points in figure  [ plotnvsspos2fig ] .",
    "the probability that the first / nvss separation is between @xmath495 and @xmath536 should be nearly proportional to @xmath495 , so the `` bad matches '' data points should be concentrated near the @xmath535 limit at the top of figure  [ plotnvsspos2fig ] , and nearly half of them should be above @xmath537 .",
    "the broad distribution of high data points in figure  [ plotnvsspos2fig ] , especially the black band at the very top , shows that most of the outliers can not be explained by `` bad sources '' but are consistent with being `` bad matches '' .",
    "the percentage of bad matches is so high because the search circle radius was set to be @xmath523 for all sources , regardless of flux density or calculated position error . in actual practice",
    ", nobody blindly identifies an object @xmath523 away from a source whose radio position was measured with a beam of fwhm radius @xmath538 .",
    "the radius of the circle in which pure position - coincidence identifications are accepted is reasonably chosen to be somewhere between @xmath539 for 90% and @xmath540 , and identification candidates at larger separations are rejected .",
    "the appendix of @xcite derives the equations actually used to choose search - circle radii for pure position - coincidence identifications and calculates the resulting identification completeness and reliability . for unresolved nvss sources , and most nvss sources are unresolved , these limits are between @xmath541 and @xmath542 at high flux densities and between @xmath543 and @xmath544 at the nvss sensitivity limit .",
    "all candidate matches with larger offsets would be rejected .",
    "figure  [ plotnvsspos2fig ] shows that there are many such points , and counting them as real identifications is responsible for the very high red `` empirical '' @xmath504 line .",
    "the `` empirical '' model attributing large radio position errors to `` bad sources '' was used to support the `` resolution model '' for identifications in appendix b. the `` resolution model '' states that the radio - optical matching radius should be fixed at 40% of the fhwm resolution @xmath66 for _ every _ s / n and @xmath66 : `` this analysis shows that matching at the @xmath476 resolution of nvss requires a matching radius of @xmath545% of the nvss fwhm resolution .",
    "our experience with the first survey is similar : to get a reasonably complete list of optical identifications we had to use a matching radius of @xmath546% of the first fwhm resolution .",
    "we argue that is a universal requirement for radio sources , at least for sources down to the sub - mjy regime : the matching radius that is required for realistic radio source morphologies is 40% of the fwhm resolution . ''",
    "this `` resolution model '' drives all - sky to higher angular resolution ( @xmath2 ) than first ( @xmath547 ) , emu ( @xmath24 ) , and wodan ( @xmath548 ) :  wodan will therefore require an optical matching radius of @xmath549 and askap - emu will require @xmath550 .",

    "33% of first sources have a true match within @xmath552 .",
    "the conclusion is that half the optical counterparts at sdss depth will be false matches when using a @xmath551 matching radius .",
    "`` the number of false matches can be reduced somewhat by doing a careful analysis of the likelihood of association as a function of separation , but when the starting point is contaminated by 50% of false matches , the final list of identifications will not complete or reliable .",
    "the false matching problem will only get worse for deeper optical / ir data . ''",
    "appendix b of @xcite concludes : `` the bottom line is that we need high resolution to get the accurate positions required for optical identifications .",

    "this conclusion is an essential part of the vlass justification , so it should be examined very carefully .",
    "what if it is wrong , and more sensitive ( @xmath553 ) lower - resolution ( @xmath24 ) surveys like emu are actually _ better _ than all - sky for making complete and reliable optical identifications ?      there is no doubt that accurate radio positions are needed to make complete and reliable identifications with faint optical objects by position - coincidence alone .",
    "a pure position - coincidence identification program chooses the optical object that is both closest to the radio position and lies within a pre - defined search area ; if there is no such optical object , there is no identification .",
    "the optimum size for the search area is a compromise determined by the combined radio and optical position uncertainties and by the surface density of optical objects .",

    "all pure position - coincidence identifications fail when the sky density of optical candidates becomes too high . for example , suppose the entire sky were covered by optical images as sensitive as the hudf , which contains @xmath576 objects per square arcmin brighter than @xmath577 @xcite .",
    "would that be a disaster for identifying radio sources in all - sky or emu ?",
    "no , because we already know that most sub - mjy radio sources have counterparts brighter than @xmath578 @xcite , so most of their identifications can be recovered by ignoring the countless significantly fainter optical objects .",

    "one reason for bad matches is that there are more first sources per square degree ( @xmath584 ) than nvss sources ( @xmath585 ) because first is more sensitive than the nvss to point sources , so not all first sources actually have real nvss matches .",

    "it is the core of a triple radio source ( figure  [ 164452fig ] ) , and its optical identification with a @xmath603 sdss quasar at 16 44 52.57 + 37 30 09.2 is secure .",
    "the nvss does not detect the core , only the two lobes of this 188  mjy radio source .",
    "the bad first - nvss match is with the northwest radio lobe 25 arcsec away in position angle @xmath604 , not with the flux - weighted centroid .",
    "the centroid of the nvss double source is at 16 44 52.83 + 37 30 09.5 , @xmath605 from the sdss quasar .",
    "this offset is only 5% of the 66 arcsec lobe separation and quite sufficient to make the identification .",
    "thus this is not a `` bad source , '' but the ability of first to detect the core separately is still an advantage , leading to a subarcsec radio - optical offset , while the nvss radio - optical offset is 3.2 arcsec . on the other hand ,",
    "the core flux density is only @xmath13 the first detection limit , so if this source were @xmath606 less luminous or twice as far away , first would not detect the core .",
    "then first would be at a disadvantage because it misses about 50 mjy of the lobe flux , so the first centroid position at 16 44 52.44 + 37 30 14.5 is less accurate , being @xmath607 from the optical position .    which of the final 20 sources in the list are bad matches with completely unrelated stronger sources ?",
    "the 3.7  mjy first source number 199 at 12 02 23.678 + 13 20 06.77 has the second - largest first - nvss separation ( @xmath608 ) .",
    "the correct match for the unresolved 103  mjy nvss source at 12 03 20.68 + 13 19 30.9 is the single - component 105  mjy first source at 12 03 20.649 + 13 19 31.45 , and their first - nvss separation is @xmath609 .",
    "this association is confirmed by the optical identification of the nvss source with the galaxy 2masx j12032061 + 1319316 , also @xmath609 from the nvss position .",
    "the 3  mjy first source number 192 at 13 44 36.420 + 16 07 27.86 is unrelated to the much stronger nvss / first source at 13 44 36.06 + 16 07 08.7 .",
    "the strong source has a flat radio spectrum , so it unlikely to be a lobe of source 192 .",
    "the 2.2 mjy first source number 190 at 10 36 41.440 + 12 33 32.82 is unrelated to the @xmath610 nvss / first source which is identified with a 2mass @xmath611 quasar at 10 36 40.36 + 12 33 38.9 .",
    "the 7  mjy first source number 189 at 09 02 35.299 @xmath61200 21 12.77 appears to be unrelated to the stronger nvss / first double source to the east .",
    "the weak , extended first source number 187 is in the lobe of the unrelated triple source identified with a bright galaxy whose core is at 11 05 22.861 + 30 09 41.46 .",
    "removing these bad matches from the list lowers the 90% first - nvss separation to @xmath613 , or @xmath614 .",
    "most of the remaining sources in the `` top 20 '' are bad matches with individual nvss lobes of double sources larger than @xmath615 rather than with the nvss centroids .",
    "many of these nvss centroids may be farther than @xmath605 to the radio cores , so they wo nt lower the estimated 90% separation by much . replacing the component offsets with centroid offsets will , however , greatly shorten the long `` tail '' of large offsets and eliminate the conspicuously high points in figures  [ plotnvsspos2fig ] and [ plotnvsspos5bfig ] .",
    "further refining the appendix b approach to calculating the resolution @xmath66 required to make deep optical identifications is probably not worthwhile because : + ( 1 ) the sample is biased by the high resolution of first , so it excludes many extended sources , spiral galaxies in particular .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the optical identifications were made with cataloged first source components , not with complete radio sources .",
    "thus triple sources with sufficiently strong cores have been identified , but most double sources have not .",
    "i conclude that 90% of the identifications conservatively lie within @xmath616 ; a @xmath617 search radius is unnecessarily large",
    ". the `` resolution '' model in appendix b of @xcite indicated that a vlass with @xmath618 resolution and a @xmath619 identification search radius can make reliable deep position - coincidence identifications while emu with @xmath24 and a @xmath550 search radius can not .",
    "however , a @xmath393 search radius is @xmath620 for emu , which easily satisfies the conservative new @xmath616 requirement , so the high resolution of all - sky is not needed for identification reliability and will hurt identification completeness .",
    "emu is far more sensitive than all - sky to both unresolved cores and extended emission from lobes and spiral galaxies , making it better than all - sky for complete as well as reliable optical identifications .",
