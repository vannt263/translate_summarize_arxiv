    "young stars in the vicinity of the classical t - tauri star tw hydrae were first proposed to be associated by @xcite . since then , many new members have been proposed and studied , and the tw hyadrae association ( twa ) is now currently made up of a few dozen members ( see @xcite and @xcite for the most recent membership reviews ) .",
    "twa has an age of @xmath18 myr , a critical age of stellar evolution and planet formation , between that of t - tauri and main sequence stars .",
    "this association s young age and proximity to the sun ( @xmath150 pc ) have made it an area of intense study , most notably for low - mass members ( such as 2m1207b ; @xcite ) and circumstellar disks ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "previous studies of dusty disks in twa have shown a diverse array of disk properties for its members , spanning a range of evolutionary stages .",
    "the first four disks ( tw hya , hen-3 600 , hd 98800 , and hr4796a ) were detected with the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ) . after the discovery of new members , surveys were performed to identify any additional sources with ir - excess above predicted stellar photospheres using mid - ir imaging from the ground @xcite and space @xcite with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "until recently , no additional members showing strong ir - excess emission have been found , though some members showing small amounts of excess ( @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5/@xmath6 @xmath7 0.5% ) have been proposed ( twa 7 and twa 13 - @xcite ; twa 8b and twa 19 - @xcite ) .",
    "the surveys by @xcite and @xcite show a clear bimodal distribution of excess emission at mid - ir wavelengths , indicating that most members have negligible amounts of warm dust surrounding them .",
    "disks have since been discovered around 4 new twa members not included in the previous mid - ir studies , 2m1207 @xcite , sspm 1102 ( @xcite and @xcite ) , twa 30a @xcite , and twa 30b @xcite .",
    "these four most recent disk discoveries are all around late - type members ( spectral types @xmath8 m4 ) , indicating a very high disk fraction for objects of this type in twa .    a new method of identifying young stars employed by @xcite utilizing uv - excess measurements from the _ galaxy evolution explorer _",
    "( galex ; @xcite ) led to the proposal of several new twa candidates .",
    "@xcite , using galex in a similar way , independently confirm the membership of one of the proposed candidates of @xcite ( twa 32 ) and propose another additional member ( twa 31 ) .    with the _ wide - field infrared explorer _",
    "( wise ) , we now have the opportunity to explore each current member , old and new , with mid - ir wavelengths to search for excess emission indicative of circumstellar material . in this letter , we summarize assessment of twa membership , and attempt to re - analyze all previous reports of ir - excess .",
    "we also evaluate all members for which mid - ir photometry has not been performed , including new members , to search for evidence of any surrounding dusty disk .",
    "establishing the membership status of twa is difficult . this is partly due to the overlap with the lower - centaurus crux ( lcc ) region of the scorpius centaurus complex ( sco - cen ) .",
    "young stars found in this area can be difficult to place because the age of the lcc ( @xmath110 - 20 myr ) is similar enough to that of twa that youth indicators alone can not distinguish between the two .",
    "typically , a distance measurement is relied upon to make the final distinction , because the lcc is generally further away than twa ( lcc @xmath1120 pc ; twa @xmath150 pc ) . however , with the addition of new members , such as twa 29 ( d @xmath190 pc ) and twa 31 ( d @xmath1110 pc ) , the boundary between the lcc and twa is becoming much more ambiguous , providing evidence that twa may indeed be the front edge of the lcc , as proposed by @xcite . for the purposes of this work , we choose a distance cut of 100 pc for the identification of twa members , acknowledging that this choice will need further revision if more members are identified at intermediate distances .    a current summary of the properties of proposed twa members is given in table 1 .",
    "when more than one value for a property of a particular object is available , we opt for the most recent measurement",
    ". a complete list of members is crucial when evaluating properties such as excess fractions , age , and group velocities .",
    "@xcite evaluated the membership of all proposed twa members up to twa designation 28 ( including eight objects labeled as secondaries to twa members ) , with the exception of 4 possible members for which kinematical data was found to be lacking . by applying a convergence method to the remaining 32 stars ,",
    "6 were found to have a twa membership probability of zero ( 15a , 17 , 18 , 19a , 19b , and 24 ) , and we agree with this assessment based on the discrepant distances found for these stars ( d @xmath9 100 ) compared to those of members found to have a high probability of membership ( 70 @xmath9 d @xmath9 25 ) . of the remaining",
    ", 2 stars were categorized as unlikely members ( 12 and 21 ) , and 2 as possible members ( 6 and 14 ) .",
    "a total of 22 stars were found to be high probability members .",
    "twa 15b , twa 22 ,",
    "twa 23 , and twa 28 were the four possible members not evaluated by @xcite .",
    "as of this writing , twa 15b still lacks the kinematical information necessary to properly evaluate its membership , though its estimated distance ( 100 pc ) from @xcite , inconsistent with known twa members , leads us to label its status as questionable . @xcite",
    "performed a thorough analysis of the kinematics of twa 22 , but the results were somewhat inconclusive .",
    "we retain twa 22 as a possible member .",
    "@xcite reevaluate the kinematics of twa 23 ( found to be spectroscopic binary ) , and show its uvw space motion is consistent with being a twa member . in a similar fashion as twa 22 , @xcite thoroughly evaluate the membership of twa 28 with high precision proper motion and parallax measurements , and determine it is a true member of twa .",
    "since the review of @xcite , six objects have been assigned twa designations ( 11c , 29 , 30a , 30b , 31 , and 32 ) .",
    "twa 11c was discovered and determined to be a member of twa by @xcite via its common proper motion to twa 11ab and strong lithium absorption and h@xmath10 emission confirming its youth . for twa 29 ,",
    "first proposed by @xcite , we determine new proper motion values based on its 2mass and wise positions .",
    "these new values , listed in table 1 , along with its estimated distance , strong h@xmath10 emission , and position relative to other twa members , make its membership highly likely .",
    "twa 30a and twa 30b have been determined to be highly likely members by @xcite and @xcite respectively , and we agree with their analysis .",
    "@xcite show that proposed members twa 31 and 32 share spectroscopic , photometric , and kinematic properties with known members , thereby solidifying their membership .",
    "this is definitely the case for twa 32 , with uvw space motions are defined with respect to the sun .",
    "u is positive toward the galactic center , v is positive in the direction of galactic rotation , and w is positive toward the north galactic pole . ]",
    "consistent with known twa members . for twa 31 , though , this is not so obvious .",
    "@xcite quote a photometric distance to twa 31 of 110 pc , a distance inconsistent with that of known members .",
    "additionally , in their analysis , they compare the uvw of twa 31 to some stars with questionable membership , such as twa 12 , 14 , and 22 , making the uvw for twa 31 seem more reasonable than it should . the claim that twa 31 is certainly too young to be an lcc member is valid when the lcc is assigned an age of 16 myr .",
    "however , if the lcc is younger ( @xmath110myr , as suggested by @xcite ) , then the use of age indicators as a deciding factor for membership in twa or the lcc is unsound . as mentioned above",
    ", this may be one of many possible objects between twa and the lcc that make a distinct boundary between the two unclear .",
    "we retain twa 31 as a possible member for this study because of the large uncertainty ( @xmath110% ) in its distance estimate .",
    "in summary , of all stars with twa designations , we find there to be 30 bona - fide twa members , 4 possible members , one questionable member , 2 unlikely members , and 7 nonmembers .",
    "this is displayed in table 1 with the following symbols representing the various designations : y = true member , y ?",
    "= possible member , ?",
    "= questionable member , n ?",
    "unlikely member , and n = nonmember .",
    "for every confirmed member of twa , we cross - correlate with the wise catalog . out of the 30 confirmed members of twa ,",
    "26 were detected with wise .",
    "the four not included in wise ( twa 3b , twa 4b , twa 5b , and twa 11b ) , all companions , are too close to their primary members to be resolved individually .",
    "three members were too faint to be detected in wise channel 4 , only having upper limits ( twa 9b , twa 26 , and twa 29 ) .",
    "for these members , we searched the spitzer heritage archive for possible detections at 24 @xmath0 m with the multiband - imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ; @xcite ) to contribute to our mid - ir excess statistics .",
    "twa 26 was the only observed member able to be detected .",
    "source extraction was performed on the mips post basic calibrated data ( pbcd ) mosaic files using the astronomical point source extraction ( apex ) package for this source , and the resulting flux measurement is included in table 2 .    for the remaining members , all",
    "were detected in all four wise bands .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) were generated using available catalog data from tycho-2 , 2mass , and wise .",
    "stellar photosphere fluxes are predicted from our sed fitting technique ( as described in @xcite ) .",
    "we convert the wise magnitudes to fluxes using the conversion factors from @xcite for each source , then look for excess by examining each sed individually and checking the ratio of the wise channel 4 flux versus the predicted photospheric flux at 22 @xmath0 m .",
    "we flag potential excess sources as those having a wise measurement greater than 5 times the wise photometric uncertainty above our photospheric flux estimate at 22 @xmath0 m . predicted photospheric flux estimates , measured wise fluxes , and significance of excess calculations for possible and true members of twa are given in table 2 for wise channels 1 , 3 , and 4 ( wise channel 2 is not included because the spectral models in the wise channel 2 region are affected by the fundamental co bandhead at 4.7 @xmath0 m for later - type stars ) .",
    "the significance of excess evaluation only takes into account the wise photometric uncertainties and not any uncertainty from the spectral fitting .",
    "as seen in table 2 , we recover previous reports of excess indicative of a dusty disk for twa 1 , 3a , 4a , 7 , 11a , 27 , 28 , 30a , and 30b .",
    "we also find strong excess around newly proposed members twa 31 and 32 .",
    "the presence of dust around twa 30a was inferred by @xcite , and 30b was determined to have ir - excess indicative of a disk in @xcite based on their near - ir spectra , and we show the shape of the mid - ir emission in the seds of each in figure 1 , along with the two new disk detections for twa 31 and 32 . as seen in the figure , the excess mid - infrared emission for twa 30a , 31 , and 32",
    "are each fit with a single blackbody .",
    "incomplete excess information at longer wavelengths precludes a more detailed model fit . from these simple blackbody",
    "fits we are able to provide an estimate of each disk s characteristic temperature and absorbing area ( given by the parameters tdust and @xmath3 , respectively ) from the available data .",
    "these values are displayed in figure 1 . a color - color diagram showing the clear distinction between excess and non - excess stars",
    "is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the sed for twa 30b shows a drastically different shape than that of the other sources .",
    "we believe that this unusual sed is due to the disk inclination . by using a spectral model for an m4 star scaled to the distance measured by @xcite for twa 30b , ( dashed line in figure 1 )",
    ", we see that the photospheric emission is obscured at least up to wise channel 2 .",
    "this object is likely obscured by an edge on disk , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "to fit the current data , we scale down the model spectrum to meet the j - band flux and fit the excess emission using two blackbodies of 660 and 190 k located at distances of 2 and 31 au , respectively .",
    "the inner disk temperature is in good agreement with that found by @xcite .",
    "this is only one potentially viable model capable of fitting the currently available data .",
    "a more thorough analysis of this source across many wavelengths needs to be carried out before a complete understanding can be obtained .",
    "@xcite reevaluated the work done by @xcite to determine a 24 @xmath0 m excess fraction of 30@xmath1111% for twa . the disk fraction for twa",
    "was again estimated in @xcite , using the list of members from @xcite .",
    "they determine an overall disk fraction of @xmath12% . using our updated list of current members ( 29 total ,",
    "23 individually detected at 22 @xmath0 m with wise , and one ( twa 26 ) detected at 24 @xmath0 m with spitzer ) , and wise photometry , we determine a mid - ir excess fraction of ( 10/24 ) @xmath2% .",
    "members not detected at 22 @xmath0 m with wise ( or 24 @xmath0 m with spitzer ) are not included in our excess statistics .",
    "uncertainties are estimated following the method found in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "if possible members are included , the excess fraction becomes ( 11/28 ) @xmath13% .",
    "if we focus solely on substellar members ( spectral type @xmath9 m6 ) , all three detected in wise channel 4 show excess emission ( though twa 26 shows no excess at 24 @xmath0 m ) . comparing this with that of the stellar members ( 7/23 ) @xmath14%",
    ", we see a possible indication of a difference in the disk decay lifetimes of stellar and substellar members of twa .",
    "though the sample size of substellar members is quite small , this would support the results from @xcite of mass - dependent disk lifetimes .",
    "@xcite evaluates the protoplanetary disk fraction ( based on near - ir excess ) as a function of age for sun - like stars , and show that most sun - like stars have dispersed their disks by 6 myr . to extend this work into the m - type star regime ,",
    "we cross - correlate with wise the proposed members for the @xmath15 pictoris association ( @xmath112 myr ) and @xmath16 cha cluster ( @xmath15 - 8 myr ; @xcite ) from @xcite in the same manner as above for twa , focusing solely on stars with spectral types between m0 and m6 ( at this time , there are not enough substellar members of these similarly aged associations to probe any further than m6 ) . using the same excess criteria as for twa , we find that for the @xmath16 cha cluster , of the 12 m - type stars listed in @xcite , 11 of which are individually detected with wise , 5 show 22 @xmath0 m excess . for the @xmath15 pic association , we find only one marginal case of 22 @xmath0 m excess out of 20 m - type members , coming from known debris disk - bearing member au mic ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this spectral type range , we find a protoplanetary disk fraction of ( 4/19 ) @xmath17% for twa ( 5/20 , or @xmath18% , if possible members are included ) .",
    "these results show a dramatic drop - off of protoplanetary disk - fraction with age for m - stars , from @xmath19% to @xmath17% for @xmath16 cha and twa , to no evidence for protoplanetary disks in the @xmath15 pic association .",
    "this implies that protoplanetary disk dissipation in m - stars is a rapid process ( occurring in a time - scale as short as a few myr ) with disk dispersal occurring sometime between 8 and 12 myr .",
    "gathering the most recent relevant data , we have reassessed the current membership status of the tw hydrae association .",
    "we find that there are 30 bona fide members .",
    "of these 30 , 26 members were detected at 22 @xmath0 m with wise .",
    "using predicted stellar photosphere fluxes from sed fitting , we find 7 stellar and 3 substellar members to show clear signs of ir - excess indicative of a circumstellar disk .",
    "this is the first unambiguous evidence of disks found for newly proposed members twa 30a , twa 31 and twa 32 , and the first mid - ir analysis of the disk around twa 30b .",
    "our analysis shows a difference between the stellar and substellar disk fraction , evidence of mass - dependent disk lifetimes .",
    "we also note the dramatic drop - off of excess fraction in m0-m6 type stars when compared to the similarly aged @xmath16 cha cluster and the @xmath15 pic association .",
