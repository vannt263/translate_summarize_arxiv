    "minority game ( mg ) @xcite  a game proposed by challet and zhang under the inspiration of the el farol bar problem @xcite  is a simple model showing how selfish players cooperate with each other in the absence of direct communication .",
    "it succinctly captures the self - organizing global cooperative behavior which is ubiquitously found in many social and economic systems .    in mg , @xmath0 inductive reasoning players have to choose one out of two choices independently in each turn . based only on certain commonly available global information , each player has to decide one s choice by means of his / her current best working strategy or mental model . those who end up in the minority side ( i.  e. ,  the choice with the least number of players ) win .",
    "although its rules are remarkably simple , mg exhibits very rich self - organized collective behavior @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the dynamics of mg can be explained by the so - called crowd - anticrowd theory @xcite which stated that fluctuations arisen in the mg is resulted from the interaction between crowds of like - minded agents and their anti - correlated partners .",
    "however , in the real world , people usually do not only consider the global information when they make decisions .",
    "in fact , they may also consult the opinion of their neighbors before making decisions .",
    "for example , it is not uncommon for people to consider both the recommendation of their peers ( local information ) and the stock price ( global information ) in deciding which stock to buy from the market .",
    "hence , it is instructive for us to incorporate the local information into the mg model to gain more insights on this kind of social and economic systems .    in the past few years",
    ", many researchers have studied a few variations of mg with local information @xcite .",
    "however , players can only make use of either the global or local information in each turn in these models .",
    "in contrast , people often make their decisions according to both the global information and their local information in many social and economic phenomenon . on the other hand , quan  _ et al .",
    "_ introduced the local information in the evolutionary minority game ( emg ) @xcite .",
    "since we want to focus on how are players affected by their local information in a _ non - evolutionary _ game , we shall not consider the emg with local information here . with the above consideration in mind",
    ", we would like to propose a model of mg where players use both the local and global information in an unbiased manner for making decision .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce a new model called the networked minority game ( nmg ) .",
    "it is a modified mg model in which all players can make use of not only the global information but also the local information from their neighbors that are disseminated through a network .",
    "results of numerical simulations are presented and discussed in section iii .",
    "lastly , we conclude by giving a brief summary of our work in section iv .",
    "in this section , we would like to show how to construct the networked minority game ( nmg ) model . in this repeated game",
    ", there are @xmath0 heterogeneous inductive reasoning players whose aim is to maximize one s own profit in the game . in every turn",
    ", each player has to choose one out of @xmath1 alternatives with label @xmath2 .",
    "the global minority choice , denoted as @xmath3 at time @xmath4 , is simply the least popular choice amongst all players in that turn .",
    "( note that the global minority choice is the least popular choice that are chosen by a non - zero number of players ; and it is chosen randomly amongst the choices with the least non - zero number of players in case of a tie . ) the players picked the global minority choice gain one unit of wealth while all the other lose one .    unlike in mg ,",
    "not only the global information is delivered to each player as one s external information in our model . nevertheless , the global information given to players are the same in these two models . in nmg",
    ", we call it the global history @xmath5 which is simply the @xmath1-ary string of the global minority choice of the last @xmath6 turns . the global history can only take on @xmath7 different states .",
    "we label these states by an index @xmath8 and denote the global history @xmath9 by the index @xmath10 .    besides global information",
    ", local information is also distributed via a network to all players in nmg such that individual player receive one s local information from a different source . in this game , we arrange all the players with label @xmath11 on a ring ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : f1 ] ) where the local information of a player is based on the choices of this player and his / her nearest neighbors on the ring .",
    "specifically , the local information given to the @xmath12th player is the so - called local history @xmath13 which is simply the @xmath1-ary string of the local minority choice of this player of the last @xmath14 turns .",
    "( note that we do not consider the case of @xmath15 since it is equivalent to mg . ) here , the local minority choice of the @xmath12th player at time step @xmath4 , @xmath16 , refers to the least popular choice amongst this player and his / her nearest neighbor on the ring at this time step .",
    "( in other words , @xmath16 is the least popular choice amongst @xmath17th , @xmath12th and @xmath18th player . ) however , unlike the global minority choice , the local minority choice could be an alternative that nobody chooses . in case of a tie , @xmath16",
    "is chosen randomly amongst the choices with the least number of players .",
    "the local history can only take on @xmath19 different states .",
    "we again label these states by an index @xmath20 and denote the local history of the @xmath12th player @xmath21 by the index @xmath22 . by the way , it is easy to extend nmg to the case where players are connected on a different topology .",
    "for example , we can arrange players on a dynamically random chain in which each player is connected to two randomly chosen players and all the connections between players change at every time step .    in brief , each player is given a @xmath1-ary string of length @xmath23 storing both the global and local history to decide his / her choice .",
    "players can only interact indirectly with each other through the global history @xmath10 and their local history @xmath22 .",
    "however , how does each player make use of such external information to decide one s choice in the nmg ?",
    "he / she does so by employing strategies to predict the next minority choice according to both the global and local information where a strategy is a map sending individual combination of global and local history ( @xmath24,@xmath25 ) to the choice @xmath26 . a strategy @xmath27",
    "can be represented by a vector @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the minority choice predicted by the strategy @xmath27 for the input @xmath30 .    in our model , each player picks @xmath31 randomly drawn strategies from the strategy space before the game commences .",
    "( we will discuss about the strategy space in depth later on . ) just like in mg , strategies in nmg are not evolving , i.  e. , players are not allowed to revise their own @xmath31 strategies during the game . at each time step , each player uses his / her own best working strategy to guess the next global minority choice . but",
    "how does a player decide which strategy is the best ?",
    "players use the virtual score , which is simply the hypothetical profit for using a single strategy throughout the game , to evaluate the performance of a strategy .",
    "the strategy with the highest virtual score is considered as the best one .    since",
    "inductive reasoning players do not know whether a strategy is good or not before the game commences , we can not restrict players to have  good strategies \" only . as a result , all strategies in our model must be unbiased to the input , i.  e.  the global and local history .",
    "thus all the strategies employed in nmg can be picked from the full strategy space which is constituted by all the possible strategies for the input .",
    "( it is obvious that these strategies have no bias for any input . )",
    "there is a total of @xmath32 distinct strategies in the full strategy space for our model .",
    "nevertheless , it is very probable that a large number of strategies exist in this full strategy space even @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , we would like to pick strategies from the reduced strategy space @xcite to enhance computational feasibility .",
    "the reduced strategy space is only composed of strategies which are significantly different from each other .",
    "thus it characterizes the diversity of strategies in the full strategy space and we can use it instead of the full strategy space without altering the properties and dynamics of the game .",
    "how can we construct the reduced strategy space for nmg ? to answer this question , let us look at the reduced strategy space of mg first . for mg ,",
    "the reduced strategy space consists of mutually uncorrelated and anti - correlated strategies only .",
    "challet and zhang showed that the maximal reduced strategy space of the original 2-choice mg , denoted as @xmath34 for a 2-choice game with length of global history @xmath35 , is composed of @xmath36 pairs of mutually anti - correlated strategies where any two strategies from different anti - correlated strategy pairs are uncorrelated with each other @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is a total of @xmath37 different strategies in @xmath34 .",
    "( note that there are other smaller reduced strategy spaces consisting of less number of strategies for mg @xcite . )",
    "it can be shown that , in general , the maximal reduced strategy space @xmath38 for @xmath1-choice mg is composed of @xmath39 ensembles of mutually anti - correlated strategies where any two strategies from different anti - correlated strategy ensembles are uncorrelated with each other @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath38 consists of @xmath40 distinct strategies .    for nmg",
    ", it seems reasonable for us to define the reduced strategy space @xmath41 to be the maximal reduced strategy space of mg .",
    "however , we find that the cooperative behavior of the players in nmg using @xmath38 and the full strategy space are greatly different from each other .",
    "indeed , such a discrepancy is due to the bias of the strategies of @xmath38 to some of the input ( the global and local history ) in our model .",
    "hence , we should not use @xmath38 to substitute the full strategy space in nmg .",
    "in fact , we must define the reduced strategy space @xmath41 in a different way .    for nmg ,",
    "a strategy @xmath42 is unbiased to the input if it satisfies the following conditions :    )    simply looking at the predictions of this strategy for a _ given _ global history does not give us any information about its predictions for any other global history .",
    "simply looking at the predictions of this strategy for a _ given _ local history does not give us any information about its predictions for any other local history .",
    "accordingly , we define the reduced strategy space of nmg as follows : @xmath43 where the @xmath12th player uses the so - called segment strategy @xmath44 to predict the global minority choice for the global history @xmath10 if @xmath45 in case of @xmath46 and respectively for the local history @xmath22 if @xmath47 in case of @xmath48 . table [ tab : t1 ] illustrates how a strategy in @xmath41 gives the prediction of the next minority choice .",
    "it is easy to show that the number of distinct strategies in @xmath41 is either @xmath49 or @xmath50 depending on the ratio of @xmath51 .",
    "note that we should not define @xmath41 to be given by just one of the above expressions over all range of @xmath51 .",
    "otherwise , there is a large redundancy of strategies in @xmath41 since many strategies are very similar for such case .",
    "( however , it does not matter if we define @xmath41 by the second expression when @xmath52 . ) indeed , we have verified that the cooperative behavior of the players in nmg using @xmath41 and the full strategy space agree well with each other ; i.  e. , @xmath41 can successfully characterize the diversity of strategy in the full strategy space .",

    "the expectation value of the attendance of any alternative should be equal to @xmath55 .",
    "accordingly , the variance of the attendance @xmath56 represents the loss of players in the game .",
    "( here , @xmath57 denotes the average over time . ) hence , we would like to study @xmath58 and @xmath59 as a function of the complexity of the system for our model . which parameter can be used as a measure of the complexity of the system ?",
    "it is the so - called control parameter @xmath60 @xcite which is the ratio of the strategy space size to the number of strategies at play . for nmg",
    ", the control parameter @xmath60 is equal to either @xmath61 for @xmath46 or @xmath62 for @xmath48 .    on the other hand",
    ", we also want to compare the variance of the attendance with the prediction by the crowd - anticrowd theory @xcite in order to investigate the crowding effect in our model .",
    "since the strategies used in nmg ( which are picked from @xmath41 ) are neither anti - correlated nor uncorrelated , we can not only consider the interactions of the anti - correlated strategies in the crowd - anticrowd calculation of the variance just like in mg @xcite and the multichoice mg @xcite .",

    "we should aware that the variance of attendance for different alternatives must equal when averaged over time and initial choice of strategies since there is no bias for any alternative in our game .",
    "in all the simulations reported in this paper , each set of data was recorded from @xmath70 independent runs . in each run",
    ", we run 10000 steps starting from initialization before making any measurements .",
    "we have checked that it is already enough for the system to attain equilibrium in all the cases reported here .",
    "then we took the average values on 15000 steps after the equilibration . to be computational feasible",
    ", we choose the case where @xmath33 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .      in this section ,",
    "we compare the performance of players in nmg with that in mg .",
    "since the system exhibits peculiar properties in nmg with @xmath73 , we delay the discussion about this case to section  [ mg0 ] .",
    "let us begin by investigating the properties of the mean attendance as a function of the control parameter @xmath60 in nmg .",
    "obviously , the mean attendance in nmg is similar to mg for all values of @xmath74 .",
    "that is to say , it always fluctuates around @xmath75 such that players can maximize their global profit .",
    "next we evaluate the performance of the players in nmg by studying the variance of the attendance per player @xmath76 versus the control parameter @xmath60 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] .",
    "( note that the variance of the two choices must be the same by symmetry for a 2-choice game ; and all the variance mentioned in this section are divided by the number of player @xmath0 for objective comparison . )",
    "we find that the variance in nmg is always much smaller than that in mg for small @xmath60 no matter what is the value of @xmath51 . in other words , players perform much better in nmg than in mg through the introduction of their own local information when @xmath60 is small . when the reduced strategy space size is relatively small comparing with the number of strategies at play , the fluctuation of the attendance is large in mg due to the overcrowding effect of player s strategies @xcite .",
    "under the overcrowding effect , players tend to choose the same alternative for the same global history since they use some very similar strategies . however , in nmg , players can choose different alternatives even they use the same strategy since they consider both their local information and the global information in deciding their choice .",
    "such phenomenon will dilute the overcrowding effects of the strategies in nmg and so players can perform much better than in mg when @xmath60 is small .",
    "when the control parameter @xmath60 increases , the overcrowding effect will be suppressed in both nmg and mg . in mg , the maximal cooperation amongst the players can be achieved subsequently when the number of strategies at play is approximately equal to the reduced strategy space size . however , in nmg , players need to cooperate with each other through both the global information and their local information .",
    "these mixed types of information obtained from different sources makes the cooperation amongst all players becomes much more difficult for all value of @xmath51 .",
    "so the variance in nmg is larger than in mg around the critical point @xmath77 and it tends to the coin toss value ( which is the variance resulting fromplayers making random choices throughout the game ) when @xmath60 increases further .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] shows the variance of attendance per player @xmath76 as a function of the control parameter @xmath60 in nmg for different ratio of @xmath6 to @xmath79 .",
    "when @xmath80 , the variance becomes larger as @xmath79 increases regardless of the value of the control parameter @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , the variance tends to the coin - toss value for @xmath81 over all range of @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath48 , the performance of players becomes better if more local information is available no matter what is the value of @xmath60 . to account for this phenomenon",
    ", we should consider the structure of strategies in the reduced strategy space @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath82 , each strategy is composed of more segment strategies belonging to a smaller strategy space @xmath64 as @xmath79 increases . therefore , players are more likely to use similar strategies and the overcrowding effect of strategies will dominate which results in large fluctuations of the attendance .",
    "similarly , when @xmath48 , the segment strategies are drawn from @xmath63 and thus the variance becomes larger as @xmath6 increase due to the overcrowding effect of strategies . in particular , when @xmath81 , each strategy is composed of the largest number of segment strategies drawn from the smallest strategy space ( @xmath63 or @xmath64 ) and so the variance is the largest for such case .",
    "when @xmath73 , only local information is available to each player . from numerical simulation ,",
    "the variance in nmg with @xmath73 is found to be smaller than in mg and nmg with @xmath78 when the control parameter @xmath60 is small and approaches zero .",
    "it implies that the cooperation amongst players in nmg with @xmath73 is much better than in mg and nmg with @xmath78 for small @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , player s cooperation in nmg with no global information is resulted from their local interaction . to investigate the local interaction ,",
    "we calculate the correlation function for the local minority choices of two neighboring players as follows : @xmath83 ^ 2 \\rangle - \\langle \\omega_l^{i}(t ) \\rangle^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the local minority choice of the @xmath12th player at time @xmath4 .",
    "we reveal that the correlation function @xmath85 is equal to infinity for many neighboring players when @xmath73 .",
    "that is to say , many players always choose the same alternative as their nearest neighbors throughout the game .",
    "in such case , we found that the local histories of these players remain the same such that their local minority choices are completely frozen .",
    "in fact , the decision of a frozen player is dominated by the components of segment strategies corresponding to @xmath86 or @xmath87 whenever @xmath73 . for instance , suppose the components of segment strategies corresponding to @xmath88 equal @xmath89 for all @xmath31 strategies of two nearest neighbors .",
    "once their local histories are @xmath90 , their own local minority will then be @xmath91 in this turn and their local histories will be @xmath90 again at the next time step .",
    "it is a fixed point of the dynamics leading to the dimension reduction of the reduced strategy space .",
    "if similar configurations arise along the ring , the choices of some players can be determined before each turn because their actions are frozen .",
    "the freezing effect of players will minimize the fluctuations of attendance since it is only contributed by few non - frozen players .",
    "indeed , it is the negligence of global information that allows the strong local interactions amongst players who are connected on a ring . on the contrary",
    ", players can only weakly interact with each other locally if they are placed on a dynamically random chain in which each player is connected to two randomly chosen players with all the connections between players change at every time step .",
    "hence , whenever @xmath73 , the freezing effect of players disappears and the variance tends to the coin - toss value for the case of the dynamically random chain as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] .",
    "on the other hand , numerical results show that the probability for the freezing of players decreases exponentially when @xmath6 increases for @xmath48 .",
    "it is because each strategy is composed of more number of segment strategies and the disturbance from the global information becomes more significant when more global information is available .",
    "so the variance becomes larger as @xmath79 decreases for @xmath48 .      in order to investigate the crowding effect in nmg",
    ", we compare the numerical results of the variance with the predictions by the crowd - anticrowd theory .",
    "we find a large discrepancy between them whenever @xmath92 or @xmath93 although their trends are consistent with each other for all value of @xmath74 .",
    "according to the crowd - anticrowd theory , the variance of attendance for a given realization of the quenched disorder @xmath94 ( i.  e.  the initial configuration of the system ) is given by @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes the sum over the strategies in the corresponding reduced strategy space , @xmath97 is the action of strategy @xmath98 to the history @xmath99 at time @xmath4 ( @xmath100 corresponds to the two alternatives ) and @xmath101 is the number of players using strategy @xmath98 at time @xmath4 . in mg",
    ", @xmath102 should be equal to zero and thus is dropped .",
    "( for mg , the variance in fact plays the role of the effective hamiltonian of the spin - glass - like system while the strategies can be interpreted as the quenched disorder @xcite ; thus we can state that the four - point correlation function is dropped in the effective hamiltonian of the system for mg . )",
    "such expectation is based on the fact that the number of players using an uncorrelated strategy pair are , on average of the history @xmath99 , independent from the response of the strategy pair to the history in mg . however , from numerical simulation , we find that @xmath103 is equal to a large negative number for nmg with @xmath92 . in other words ,",
    "the uncorrelated segment strategy pairs are no longer independent with each other . through the local interaction",
    ", players tend to use the uncorrelated segment strategy pairs whenever the pairs choose the opposite choice .",
    "it is a favorable solution of the dynamics because the uncorrelated segment strategies can now contribute to the crowd - anticrowd cancellation which will in turn lead to the further reduction of the fluctuation of attendance .",
    "in fact , the crowd - anticrowd cancellation by the uncorrelated strategies is only possible in nmg since players have the freedom to choose which uncorrelated segment strategies to be used on the basis of the local information .",
    "we can correct the semi - analytical results of the crowd - anticrowd theory by counting the contribution of both the anti - correlated and uncorrelated segment strategies to the crowd - anticrowd cancellation .",
    "the corrected semi - analytical results is found to match with the numerical one as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] .",
    "so we conclude that the discrepancy is mainly due to the crowd - anticrowd cancellation by the uncorrelated strategies for @xmath92 .    when @xmath93 , the discrepancy of the predictions of the crowd - anticrowd theory from the numerical results is due to the freezing of players .",
    "the ergodicity of the local histories of frozen players is broken down under the freezing effects .",
    "in other words , some possible states of the local histories will never be visited for frozen players since the effective dimension of the strategy space is reduced .",
    "of course , this will violate the ergodicity assumption in the crowd - anticrowd theory .",
    "so the results predicted by the crowd - anticrowd theory show a large discrepancy from the numerical results when @xmath93 .",
    "in summary , we find that nmg exhibits a remarkably different behavior from mg . in nmg with non - zero global information , selfish players on the ring can cooperate with each other to reduce their loss ; moreover , their cooperation is much better than in mg by using the local information that are disseminated through the ring except when the number of strategies at play is approximately equal to the strategy space size .",
    "such phenomenon is believed to be due to the dilution of the crowding effect of players which is resulted from their local interactions on the ring .    in nmg with no global information , many players on the ring are found to be frozen where their action and also their local minority choice remain the same throughout the game .",
    "we reveal that the freezing occurs when their decisions are dominated by the components of segment strategies corresponding to @xmath104 or @xmath87 .",
    "such domination arises because of the strong local interaction on the ring due to the absence of the global information .    on the other hand",
    ", we find that the predictions of the crowd - anticrowd theory deviate very much from the numerical results for nmg . such discrepancy is found to be due to the crowd - anticrowd cancellation contributed by the uncorrelated strategies in nmg whereas it is impossible for the uncorrelated strategies to contribute to the crowd - anticrowd cancellation in mg .",
    "in fact , all the above arguments should still be valid when players are connected on a network with different topology in nmg provided that each player always obtains the local information from the same neighbors ; and thus we believe that the cooperative behavior of players are similar in all these cases .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the order parameter is also worth to be studied for nmg . from this study",
    ", we may learn whether there is a phase transition from a symmetric phase to an asymmetric phase as the complexity of the system increases just like that in mg .",

    "<S> to study the interplay between global market choice and local peer pressure , we construct a minority - game - like econophysical model . in this so - called networked minority game model , </S>",
    "<S> every selfish player uses both the historical minority choice of the population and the historical choice of one s neighbors in an unbiased manner to make decision . </S>",
    "<S> results of numerical simulation show that the level of cooperation in the networked minority game differs remarkably from the original minority game as well as the prediction of the crowd - anticrowd theory . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the deviation from the crowd - anticrowd theory is due to the negligence of the effect of a four point correlation function in the effective hamiltonian of the system . </S>"
