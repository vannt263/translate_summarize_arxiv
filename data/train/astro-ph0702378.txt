    "nearby dwarf galaxies have proven to be ideal laboratories to investigate how stars form out of gas and how , in turn , violent star formation shapes the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "these systems are highly susceptible to the formation of shells and holes in the neutral gas phase ; more energetic star formation can lead to the formation of gaseous outflows from these systems .",
    "previous studies have shown that dwarf galaxies can be used as testbeds of ` simple ' prescriptions for star formation ( since these systems are typically in solid  body rotation and are therefore less affected by shear in the ism ) and for understanding the connection between mechanical energy input into the ism ( ` feedback ' ) and future star formation .",
    "given their low metallicities , they also provide a unique opportunity to study the conditions of the ism in environments that may resemble those in the earliest starforming systems at high redshift .",

    "10 ) is markedly different from that of ic  2574 ; the spectrum is dominated by continuum emission , and only very faint pah features are present .",
    "the thick grey line again shows the comparison to our simple template : here two blackbody curves ( one at 300k and one at 700k , contributing equal flux density at 8.3@xmath14 m ) were needed to adequately fit the continuum of holmberg  ii ( note again that these curves do not represent physically meaningful numbers but are only used to describe the shape of the continuum to first order , see also discussion in smith et al .",
    "2006 ) ; we then added a scaled version of our pah template to this continuum emission ( thick grey line ) .",
    "a comparison to this curve shows that , although the s / n is low , faint pah features appear to be present at 6.2 , 7.7 , 11.3 and 12.7@xmath14m e.g. , the 11.3@xmath14 m  pah feature is detected at 7@xmath34 ( total flux ; peak : 4@xmath34 ) . from this",

    "this result emphazises the fact that the strength of the pah features is not a simple linear function of metallicity ( see also smith et al.2006 , who find a wide range of pah strengths ( factor of @xmath0 10 ) near the engelbracht et al .",
