    "any quantum process can be described as a completely positive and trace preserving map ( quantum channel ) acting on the set of trace class operators ( quantum states ) . in quantum information theory ,",
    "one of the most important problems is finding the maximal rates ( i.e. , the capacities ) at which quantum or classical information can be transmitted via quantum channels with vanishing error in the limit of large number of signals ( channel uses )  @xcite .",
    "earlier works on the subject focused on models where the noise affecting the communication is assumed to act independently and identically for each channel use ( memoryless quantum channels ) .",
    "recently , however , an increasing attention has been devoted to correlated noise models ( quantum memory channels ) , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "memory effects in the communication may arise when the dynamics of the media is characterized by temporal correlations which extend on timescales which are comparable with the time delay between consecutive channel uses .",
    "for instance , under certain conditions optical fibers may show relaxation times or birefringence fluctuations times longer than the separation between successive light pulses  @xcite .",
    "similar effects occur in solid state implementations of quantum hardware , where memory effects due to low - frequency impurity noise produce substantial dephasing  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , moving from the model introduced in  @xcite , memory noise effects have also been studied in the contest of many - body quantum systems by relating their properties to the correlations of the channel environmental state  @xcite or by studying the information flow in spin networks  @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that memory effects should improve the information transfer of a communication line  @xcite . however",
    ", finding optimal encodings is rather complex and up to date only a limited number of models have been solved  @xcite . in the context of bosonic channels",
    "@xcite , we have recently introduced an exactly solvable model which effectively describes the transmission of signals along attenuating media characterized by finite relaxation times .",
    "it is characterized by two parameters @xmath1 $ ] , enabling to describe different scenarios ranging from memoryless to inter - symbol interference channels  @xcite , up to perfect memory configurations  @xcite , providing thus the first comprehensive quantum information characterization of memory effects in the continuous variable setup .    in this article",
    "we show the details of such a model and we extend it to encompass amplification processes besides attenuation ones ( this is formally obtained by extending the parameter space to include also @xmath2 values ) . for such processes we estimate the classical and the quantum capacity @xcite showing their enhancement with respect to the memoryless case and proving that , for the attenuating memory channel , coherent state encoding is optimal for transmitting classical information .",
    "this is accomplished by applying suitably chosen encoding and decoding unitary transformations which allow us to _ unravel _ the correlations among different channel uses .",
    "in such a way the channel is mapped into a unitary equivalent one , in which noises affecting different channel uses are independent , although not identical @xcite . using this mapping ,",
    "the channel capacities can be estimated by relying on known results on memoryless channels , which in the limit of large number of channel uses provide converging lower and upper bounds .",
    "our results also allows us to point out the existence of two different regimes characterized by a threshold value of the product @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , even in the presence of amplification , for @xmath4 the correlations among different channels uses induced by the channel dynamics are depressed exponentially with the distance among the uses .",
    "this strongly resemble the behavior of the so called _ forgetful _ memory channels , which were introduce in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of finite dimensional systems .",
    "vice - versa for @xmath5 the memory effects , as well as the correlations between different channel uses , are exponentially enhanced by the amplification .",
    "interestingly enough , irrespectively of these rather different behaviors the capacities of the model show no discontinuities at the critical threshold .",
    "even if the model we analyze is presented in an abstract setting , we believe that the results presented in the paper , as typical in optical communication analysis  @xcite , may have a potential impact on a variety of different realistic setups which are currently in use , ranging from fiber optics  @xcite , to wave - guide  @xcite , up to free - space signaling  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the model can be applied for describing memory effects at the interface between matter and light , e.g. , in quantum repeaters and quantum memories based on ensemble of atoms , in which the state of the atomic ensemble is described in terms of an effective bosonic degree of freedom @xcite .",

    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , when dealing with memory channels one has to distinguish among four different settings , which may lead to different values of the channel capacities , depending whom the initial and final memory modes are assigned to .",
    "we denote the four possible settings by the label @xmath202 : @xmath203 ( the initial memory mode is assigned to the sender and the final one to the environment ) , @xmath204 ( the initial and final memory modes are assigned respectively to the sender and to the receiver ) , @xmath205 ( initial memory mode to the environment and final one to the receiver ) , and @xmath206 ( both initial and final memory modes are assigned to the environment ) .",
    "if the initial memory mode is assigned to the environment , the channel capacities may also depend on the memory initialization .",
    "[ we remind that the calculations presented in the previous section have been performed in the configuration @xmath206 assuming the memory mode to be initialized in the vacuum ] .    the notion of _ forgetfulness _ , and hence the class of forgetful memory channels , has been introduced in @xcite for quantum channels acting on finite - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "forgetful channels are characterized by several remarkable properties , in particular the capacities of those channels do not depend on the setting @xmath202 and on the initialization of the memory mode .",
    "let us notice that our model is defined on an infinite - dimensional hilbert space , and hence the notion of forgetfulness can not be directly applied .",
    "however , we can argue on the forgetfulness of the channel if an effective cutoff on the bosonic hilbert space is introduced . to prove the forgetfulness it is sufficient to show that , in the limit of @xmath100 , the final state of the memory mode is independent , in the sense specified in ref .",
    "@xcite , on the memory initialization .",
    "indeed , the presence of the exponential factor @xmath207 in ( [ m_lossy ] ) , ( [ m_ampl ] ) suggests that the channel is forgetful when @xmath108 , that is , when operating below threshold .",
    "we can prove that this holds true restricting to gaussian states with bounded energy .",
    "to fix the ideas , let us consider the case of the attenuating channel .",
    "the transformation ( [ m_lossy ] ) reads @xmath208 where @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and the form of the vectors @xmath211 , @xmath212 can be deduced from ( [ m_lossy ] ) .",
    "a gaussian state of the initial memory mode , the input and the environmental modes , is characterized by the first moments @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , and by the covariance matrix @xmath216 where the off - diagonal terms account for possible correlations of the initial memory mode with the input and environment modes .",
    "after @xmath0 uses of the channel , the state of the final memory mode is gaussian with first moment @xmath217 and covariance matrix @xmath218 the presence of the exponential factors in ( [ 1_moment ] ) , ( [ 2_moment ] ) guarantees the forgetfulness of the channel as long as the energy is bounded , e.g. , subjected to a constraint of the form @xmath219 the same argument can be provided for the amplifying channel , as long as it operates below threshold .",
    "it is finally worth reminding that a first step towards the extension of the notion of forgetfulness to the domain of continuous variables has been made in @xcite .",
    "however , we notice that this extension is not straightforward if the full infinite dimensional hilbert space is considered . to illustrate this issue we consider the computation of the quantum capacity , with unbounded input energy , in the generic @xmath202 setting . by inspection of fig.s [ lossym ] , [ amplifym ] , it is immediate to see that in the @xmath204 and @xmath205 settings , where the final memory mode is assigned to the receiver , at least one input mode is perfectly transmitted , leading to an infinite value of the quantum capacity for any value of the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",
    "we have shown in sec .",
    "[ qcapacity ] that the quantum capacity is finite in the @xmath206 setting ( the same can be shown in the @xmath205 setting ) for all values of the parameters , provided @xmath220 .",
    "we have introduced and characterized a model for memory effects in attenuation and amplification quantum channels .",
    "our findings show that the presence of memory always increases the quantum capacity of the communication line and may increase the classical one .",
    "interestingly enough , the highest rates of classical communication are reached without the use of entangled codewords . for the attenuating channel , the optimal encoding strategy for the memoryless channels which bound @xmath61 makes use of coherent states  @xcite . since the latter are preserved by the encoding transformation",
    "@xmath80 our results prove , as a byproduct , the optimality of coherent state encoding for the presented memory channel .",
    "we emphasis the use of the memory unraveling technique @xcite , which may allows us to evaluate the channel capacity without relying on the channel forgetfulness .",
    "this shows that the unraveling of the memory could have a much broader impact than the results we have presented here .",
    "in particular it may find applications on other contexts , e.g. , reaching beyond current restricted models that involve statistically independent errors and are often inapplicable to real physical systems .",
    "for instance , the model could be easily adapted to describe situation in which temporal ( causal ) correlations between the channel uses are replaced by spatial ones or to deal with physical models where the underlying noise is more complicated than attenuation ( e.g. , a stream of two level atoms injected through a superconducting cavity ) .",
    "the model can also be applied to describe memory effects in quantum repeaters and quantum memories with atomic ensembles , where , via the holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite , the interaction between matter and light can be modeled as a formal beam - splitter ( or linear - amplifier ) hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "an imperfect swap operation between matter and light can be described by a beam - splitter with non - unit transmissivity , which in turn may causes memory effects .",
