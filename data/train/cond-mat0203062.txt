    "suspensions of solid particles or immiscible liquid droplets in a host fluid ( colloids ) have attracted wide interest , due to a number of industrial applications ( they appear in food , paints , ink , drugs ) and fundamental research ( they show features such as casimir forces between the particles , formation of supermolecular structures and novel phases ) .",
    "colloidal systems with a _ liquid crystal _ as a host fluid are of special interest@xcite . in the _ nematic _ liquid crystals considered here ,",
    "while the system remains translationally disordered and liquid - like , there is long - range ordering of molecular orientations about a preferred direction , termed the _",
    "director_. elastic deformations of the director field around the colloidal particles produce additional long - range forces between them .",
    "these interactions can be of dipolar or quadrupolar type depending on the symmetry of the director field around the particles @xcite , and this in turn is extremely sensitive to the _ boundary conditions _ on the particle surface and the size of the particles @xcite .    to understand the interaction between the particles , it is important to know the liquid crystal ordering near one single particle .",
    "this ordering is also important for calculation of the elastic light scattering from nematic emulsions @xcite .",
    "the complication here is the presence of _ topological defects _ in such emulsions .",
    "isolated drops provide a spherical confining geometry for the liquid crystal .",
    "sufficiently strong homeotropic anchoring of the director ( that is , normal to the particle surface ) then induces a radial hedgehog defect with topological charge @xmath0 .",
    "if the director field is uniform far from the particle , i.e.  the total charge of the whole system is zero , topological considerations imply that an additional defect must be created in the medium to compensate the radial hedgehog .",
    "there are several types of defect which can arise in this case .",
    "two are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the first is a hyperbolic hedgehog with a topological charge @xmath1 , called a dipolar or _ satellite _ defect .",
    "the second is a quadrupolar or _ saturn - ring _",
    "defect , i.e.  a @xmath2 strength disclination ring that encircles the spherical particle .",
    "theoretical and numerical work based on the elastic theory @xcite suggest that the dipole configuration is stable for the micron - sized droplets which are usually realised experimentally ; the saturn - ring configuration should appear if the droplet size is reduced and , when present , it is always predicted to be most stable in the equatorial plane normal to the director . if the strength of the surface anchoring is weak enough , a third , _ surface - ring _",
    ", director configuration is possible @xcite .",
    "it has been also found that the _ twisted dipole _ configuration is possible for high enough ratios of twist to splay elastic constants @xcite .",
    "sketches of the satellite defect and saturn - ring defect .",
    ", width=302 ]    however , the elastic theory has several disadvantages because of the way it treats the core structure of the defect embedded into the nematic host .",
    "first , the defect core region is considered as an isotropic inclusion with some unknown free energy which is used as an adjustable parameter of the theory .",
    "second , the liquid crystalline phase is treated as uniaxial . however , near the defect core ( or indeed the particle surface ) these assumptions are no longer valid .",
    "as has already been demonstrated @xcite , the defect core of the simplest disclination line of strength @xmath0 has a rather complex structure : the order parameter varies near the core region ; the uniaxial phase becomes biaxial ; even the density of the mesophase can be affected by the presence of the wall or the defect @xcite .    for a better description",
    "it is necessary to use the full order parameter tensor to describe liquid crystalline ordering @xcite .",
    "this tensor exhibits no anomalous behaviour at the singularity of the director field .",
    "moreover , one can resolve order parameter variation as well as biaxiality of the defect core using a landau - de  gennes phenomenological expansion of the free energy . in this framework",
    ", only the liquid crystal density is assumed to be fixed . in its turn",
    ", density variation can be taken into account using onsager theory @xcite , although that approach will not be pursued here .",
    "another approach to the study of defect core structure is to use computer simulation .",
    "indeed , computer simulation is a well established method to treat bulk elastic coefficients @xcite , the surface anchoring strength @xcite , and structures of disclination cores @xcite .",
    "this means that computer simulation allows one to investigate the details of liquid crystalline structure which can not be resolved experimentally or using phenomenological theories .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the topological defects which appear in the liquid crystalline mesophase around a spherical droplet or colloid particle .",
    "our study complements previous results obtained by billeter and pelcovits @xcite , who used systems of 2048 molecules modelled by the gay - berne potential .",
    "the present study investigates the effect of changing the droplet size , and uses much larger numbers of molecules , up to one million .",
    "this turns out to be essential to avoid finite - size effects which are particularly important for the satellite defect , since it causes long - range director deformation .",
    "as well as observing both the saturn - ring and satellite defects , with the latter being stable only for larger particle sizes as expected , we also observe a transition between these two structures involving an intermediate , non - equatorial , _ surface - ring _ defect .",

    "sec : simulation ] we present the computational details and molecular models we use to simulate the liquid crystal mesophase and the interaction of the molecules with the droplet surface .",

    "the radius of the colloid droplet was steadily increased from a small value in systems which were already in the nematic state .",
    "this takes about @xmath32 steps to increase the droplet radius up to @xmath33 and about @xmath32 steps to equilibrate the system with the defect .",
    "this method generates an energetically favourable configuration of the kind which is stable for small colloid particles ( i.e  the ring defect ) .",
    "disordered , isotropic configurations containing the colloid droplet were compressed to the ordered , nematic , state .",
    "this method , in principle , should give the lowest free - energy configurations in an unbiased way .",
    "however , for large systems , equilibration from the isotropic phase is extremely time - consuming : systems split into small domains which then realign ( coarsen ) .",
    "3 .   for large systems , we prepared director configurations in the nematic state with the defect embedded in them . to introduce the defect into the mesophase we used approximate analytical expressions for the director field @xmath34 around the droplet , which were used to determine the initial molecular orientations .",

    "positions , relative to the colloid particle at the origin , are expressed in spherical polar coordinates @xmath40 ; the system was assumed to be invariant to rotations about the @xmath31 axis .",

    "one can see that the ring defect does not have long - range director distortions .",
    "its core region is located very close to the droplet surface and the director distortion vanishes very quickly in the liquid crystal bulk .",
    "this is in agreement with the _ quadrupolar _ nature of the defect : far from the particle the director deviation angle has asymptotic behaviour @xmath79 .",

    "the profiles which avoid the disclination have oscillating structure near the particle surface which is typical for a _ liquid - wall _ interface . the profiles which cross the disclination ring do not have oscillations .",

    "this melting damps the influence of the droplet surface on the interface region .",
    "note that , even though the disclination core is located close to the particle surface , the region where the density has an oscillating structure is quite big . therefore , the simulation box has to be of adequate size in order not to affect the defect structure .",
    "the order parameter profiles for @xmath82 are shown in fig  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "the shape of these profiles in general reflects the typical structure of the core : the center of the core has lower order than the bulk and the core region extends over a few molecular lengths . using order parameter profiles one can also define the position of the disclination ring as the location of the minimum of the order parameter . for large enough",
    "@xmath23 a second minimum appears , indicating that the disclination ring defect has a complex structure .",
    "this minimum is probably due to the density modulation near the droplet surface .",
    "as we will see , the density modulation also influences the rest of the profiles .    to emphasise the complex structure of the defect core we plot the biaxiality profiles ( fig  [ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "from the order and biaxiality profiles one can see that the main biaxial ring is accompanied by one additional biaxial ring for large @xmath23 , or even two extra rings for some @xmath23 ( e.g. @xmath83 ) . again , this is most likely due to the density modulation near the droplet surface .    using the minima of the order profiles ( or , with the same results , the maxima of the biaxiality profiles ) we extracted the distance from the core of the disclination ring to the particle surface .",
    "the dependence of this distance on the particle radius @xmath23 is shown in fig  [ fig:7 ] .",
    "it is interesting to compare with the phenomenological theory predicting linear dependence of the ring defect radius on the droplet radius : @xmath84 from minimization of the elastic free energy using a trial function @xcite , @xmath85 using a simulated annealing method @xcite , or @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "our md simulation results give @xmath87 which is in good agreement with the phenomenological theory , especially if one bears in mind the complex structure of the defect core .",
    "the director field around the satellite defect is illustrated in fig  [ fig:8 ] .",
    "the director distortion extends much further than that of the ring defect .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the symmetry of the director distribution of the satellite defect : far from the particle , the director angle vanishes as @xmath88 , i.e.  it is like a dipolar term in a multipole expansion .",

    "one can see that the density profile at @xmath98 ( across the defect core ) has less prominent oscillating structure than the other two : this is again presumably due to the partial disordering of the mesophase in the core region .",

    "simulation results show that both the satellite and ring defects are at least metastable for @xmath74 : once the particular defect is realized in the system , it is stable over the timescale that is accessible to our simulations . however , the satellite defect is not stable for the smaller droplets .",
    "indeed , we observed a rapid transition ( several thousands of md steps ) of the satellite defect to the ring defect for @xmath103 .",
    "equilibrating the initial configuration with the satellite defect in the cell with droplet radius @xmath33 , we observed that it evolves into an _ off - centered _ ring defect : a typical nematic director map is shown in fig  [ fig:12 ] .",

    "the defect region is quite large : in some cases of a similar size to the colloid particle itself . far from the particle the director profiles are in good agreement with those predicted by elastic theory .",
