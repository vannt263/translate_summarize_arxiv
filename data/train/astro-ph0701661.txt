    "quasars have been used as background sources to study the gaseous phases of a variety of objects that are located along our sight - lines to them .",
    "these objects include not only _ intervening _ absorbers such as intervening galaxies , the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , clouds in the halo of the milky way , and the host galaxies of the quasars themselves , but also _ intrinsic _ absorbers that are physically associated with the quasar central engines .",
    "one of the most promising candidates for the intrinsic absorbers are outflowing winds from the quasars that could be accelerated by radiation pressure from the accretion disk ( murray et al .",
    "1995 ; arav et al . 1995 ; proga et al .",
    "2000 ) or by magnetocentrifugal forces ( e.g. , everett 2005 ) .",
    "outflowing winds are important components of quasar central engines because they carry away angular momentum from the accretion disk and allow the remaining gas in the disk to accrete onto the central black hole .",
    "quasar outflows are also important for cosmology since they deliver energy , momentum , and metals to the interstellar and intergalactic media , thus significantly affecting star formation and galaxy assembly ( e.g. , granato et al .",
    "2004 ; scannapieco & oh 2004 ; springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ) .",
    "intrinsic narrow absorption lines ( nals ; fwhm @xmath3 ) present a powerful way to determine physical parameters of the accretion disk winds . unlike the _ broad _ absorption lines ( bals ; fwhm @xmath4 ; weymann et al .",
    "1991 ) that are also associated with quasars outflows , nals do not suffer from self - blending or from saturation , so that line parameters are more easily evaluated .",
    "bals are thought to be associated with radiatively - driven outflows from accretion disks ( e.g. , weymann et al .",
    "1991 ; becker et al .",
    "1997 ) , while it is difficult to separate intrinsic nals from intervening nals .",
    "mini - broad absorption lines ( mini - bals ) are an intermediate subclass between nals and bals , which are typically wider than those of nals , but narrower than bals .",
    "mini - bals have the advantages of both bals ( i.e. , high probability of being intrinsic lines ) and nals ( i.e. , line profiles can be resolved into individual components ) , which make them useful targets ( e.g. , churchill et al .",
    "1999 ; hamann et al .",
    "1997a ; narayanan et al .",
    "bals could probe the low - latitude , dense , fast portion of the wind , while the mini - bals and nals may probe the lower - density portion of the wind at high latitudes above the disk .",
    "thus , the study of mini - bals and nals complements the study of bals because the corresponding absorbers reside in different regions of the outflow and allow us to sample different sets of physical conditions .    to isolate intrinsic nals ,",
    "two tests are commonly used : ( i ) partial coverage , i.e. , trough dilution by un - occulted light ( e.g. , hamann et al . 1997b ; barlow & sargent 1997 ; ganguly et al .",
    "1999 ) , and ( ii ) variability of the absorption profiles within a few years in the quasar rest frames ( e.g. , hamann et al . 1997a ; narayanan et al . 2004 ; wise et al .",
    "these effects occur for intrinsic absorbers that are very compact and very dense compared to intervening absorbers . the fraction of quasars that host intrinsic associated nals ( nals within 5,000  of the quasar emission redshifts ) has been estimated to be @xmath527%  at @xmath6 , using the time variability technique ( narayanan et al . 2004 ; wise et al .",
    "2004 ) , and @xmath723%  at @xmath8 , based on partial coverage analysis ( misawa et al .",
    "these signatures are a sufficient , but not a necessary , condition to demonstrate the intrinsic nature of an absorber .",
    "it is very likely that some nals without time variability or partial coverage are also intrinsic .",
    "both of the above methods have been applied to bal and mini - bal systems .",
    "for example , partial coverage analysis has been carried out by petitjean & srianand ( 1999 ) , srianand & petitjean ( 2000 , ) yuan et al .",

    "it is quite difficult ( or almost impossible ) to deblend kinematic components in those heavily blending absorption features using low / intermediate resolution spectra .",
    "however , some authors successfully deblended narrower absorption components from each other in such systems using high resolution spectra of @xmath9 ( e.g. , yuan et al .",
    "2002 ; ganguly et al .",
    "systematic monitoring of individual mini - bals using high - resolution spectra taken on several epochs can potentially provide very important constraints on the properties of the absorbers .",

    "based on these results , misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) placed constraints ( i ) on the electron density ( @xmath14 ) and the absorber s distance from the quasar ( @xmath15  kpc ) , if a change in the ionization state causes the variability , or ( ii ) on the time scale for the absorber to cross the continuum source and the distance from the continuum source , if gas motion across the background uv source causes the variability . in the latter case , the crossing velocity is constrained to be @xmath16 , and the distance from the continuum source , @xmath17  pc .",

    ", the other nals found towards the quasar show no sign of being intrinsic .",
    "further monitoring observations make it possible to ( i ) discriminate between changes in the ionization state and motion of the absorbers across the continuum source as the cause of the time variability seen in the mini - bal , and ( ii ) to confirm whether the other nals really show neither partial coverage nor variability .    in this paper , we present the results of monitoring hs  1603 + 3820 over 4.2 years ( 1.2 years in the quasar rest frame ) based on eight spectra .",
    "six of these spectra were taken with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; noguchi et al .",
    "2002 ) on the subaru telescope , and two with the medium - resolution spectrograph ( mrs ; horner , engel , & ramsey , 1998 ) on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) .",
    "the first two spectra in this time series were presented and discussed by misawa et al ( 2003 , 2005 ) . with the new spectra we are able to sample the variations of the absorption lines more densely and",

    "we will call the dates of these observations epoch  1 through epoch  8 .",
    "six of the observations were obtained with subaru+hds , using a 08 or 10 slit width ( @xmath25 or 36,000 ) , and adopting 2@xmath261 pixel binning along the slit .",
    "the red grating , with a central wavelength of 4900   , was used to cover as many systems as possible , except for the first and the last observations that used central wavelengths of 6450    and 5700   .",
    "the other two spectra were taken with the het+mrs .",
    "the mrs features a pair of fibers : one for the target and another for the sky , which enables us to perform sky subtraction effectively .",
    "we used a 15 fiber to get @xmath27 spectra .",

    "we used the line - fitting software package minfit ( churchill 1997 ; churchill et al . 2003 ) , with which we can fit absorption profiles with four free parameters : redshift ( @xmath34 ) , column density ( ) , doppler parameter ( @xmath35 ) , and coverage fraction ( ) . here , the coverage fraction is the fraction of the background continuum source and the broad - emission line region that is covered by the intrinsic absorber . the coverage fraction can be systematically evaluated in an unbiased manner by considering the optical depth ratio of resonant , rest - frame uv doublets of lithium - like species ( e.g. , , , and ) , namely , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the residual fluxes of the blue and red members of the doublets in the continuum normalized spectrum ( hamann et al . 1997b ; barlow & sargent 1997 ; crenshaw et al .",
    "a @xmath39 value less than unity signifies that a portion of the background source is not occulted by the absorber .",
    "this , in turn , means the doublet is probably produced by an intrinsic absorber ( e.g. , wampler et al . 1995 ; barlow & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "we found 9 systems at @xmath402.55 , as identified in dobrzycki et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , but we did not detect a system at @xmath41 .",
    "this system was probably a false detection ( dobrzycki 2005 ; private communication ) . among the 9 systems ,",
    "only the system at @xmath422.45 is classified as a mini - bal system , because its line width is larger than 500  .",
    "we carried out model fits to all systems in the same manner as in our previous paper ( misawa et al . 2005 ) , except for the mini - bal .",
    "misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) performed a manual voigt profile fit to the mini - bal , because self - blending ( blending of the blue and red members of the doublet ) occurs in this system . in its original form ,",
    "the minfit code was not able to handle such self - blended regions .",
    "the code was originally written for narrow absorption lines , thus it fitted the models to the blue and red members of doublets _",
    "separately_. this procedure overproduced the residual intensity at the self - blending regions because it added contributions from two components . to avoid this problem , we revised the code so as to fit models to the blue and red members of doublets _ simultaneously _ ,",
    "i.e. , by multiplying the contributions from the two doublet members . in this paper",
    ", we fit the observed mini - bals automatically using this improved minfit .    as in misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we fitted only the first ( bluest ) two kinematic components in the system , at @xmath435318   , because the other components are so heavily blended with each other that we can not separate them , even with the improved minfit ( i.e. , minfit gives multiple solutions ) . at first",
    ", we remove the contamination from  @xmath441527 in system  b , at @xmath455318   .",
    "the  @xmath441527 line in the system did not show any detectable variability between the first two observations .",
    "the doublets for system  b show neither partial coverage nor time variability , and are consistent with it being an intervening system .",
    "therefore , the  @xmath441527 line is also not likely to vary .",
    "thus , we removed the contamination from  @xmath441527 by dividing the observed spectra by a model profile synthesized with the line parameters of  @xmath441527 , determined from an average of the first two observations presented in misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    after removing the narrow  @xmath441527 components",
    ", we applied the improved minfit to the spectrum using two components , one narrow and one broad , as in misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . during the fitting process , we initially forced the same coverage fraction for the narrow and broad components , as in misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . in that paper we showed that , during the first two epochs of observation , this solution produced an equally good fit as solutions that allowed these coverage fractions to differ .",
    "we also considered the possibility of differing coverage fractions for the narrow and broad components in later epochs of observation .",
    "figure  2 shows 6 spectra taken with subaru+hds , for which we find good model fits .",
    "the fits themselves are shown in figure  3 .",
    "we can not fit spectra obtained with het+mrs in the same manner , because of their lower resolution and s / n .",
    "therefore , on the het+mrs spectra , we overplotted model profiles synthesized with parameters that are linearly interpolated between the two adjacent epochs observed with subaru .",
    "these models provide reasonably good fits to the het+mrs profiles .",
    "the fitting parameters for the narrow and broad components , at different epochs , are summarized in table  2 .",

    "we confirmed that the fit parameters for the first two epochs are consistent within 1@xmath46 errors with those presented in misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , based on a manual fitting procedure .",
    "we also applied minfit to all metal lines in the other nal systems .",
    "since , as described later , we did not see any remarkable variability in these nal systems , we combined all 6 subaru spectra to produce a final spectrum with higher s / n ( @xmath796 per pixel ) before applying minfit to the nals .",
    "the best fit parameters are summarized in table  3 .",
    "column ( 1 ) is an identification number for the line .",
    "columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give the observed wavelength and redshift . column ( 4 ) gives the shift velocity from the quasar systemic redshift .",

    "column ( 7 ) reports the coverage fraction with its 1@xmath46 error ( which includes the error due to continuum level uncertainty as described below ) . during a fitting trial",
    ", minfit sometimes gives unphysical coverage fractions such as @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "when this happens , the other fit parameters such as the column density and doppler parameter have no physical meaning .",
    "these unphysical fit results could be caused by errors in the continuum fit .",
    "misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that the derived coverage fractions can be significantly affected by continuum level errors , especially for very weak components whose  values are close to 1 .",
    "therefore , if minfit gives unphysical  values for some components , we carry out the fit again for the entire line , assuming @xmath49 for those components , following misawa et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . in this case",
    ", we do not evaluate the error in .",
    "the best fit models are overlaid with the observed spectra in figure  4(a  i ) .",
    "there are also other error sources for the fit parameters , such as blending with other lines , and convolution of the true spectrum with the instrumental line spread function ( lsf ) .",
    "both of these are negligible if ( 1 ) the doublet is strong enough , i.e. , @xmath50 in the case of doublets , ( 2 ) the normalized residual flux is smaller than @xmath70.5 , and ( 3 ) the line profile is much wider than the instrumental lsf ( misawa et al . 2005 ) .",
    "most components in our sample are broad enough compared with the lsf ( corresponding to @xmath51 ) , and not severely blended with each other , as described in section 4.2 .",
    "we previously reported that the mini - bal of system  a shows trough dilution ( misawa et al . 2002 ) , and variability within 0.36 years ( misawa et al . 2005 ) . with the additional spectra of this paper",
    ", we follow the variability of this system for 1.2 years in the quasar rest frame , sampling it at eight epochs . and",
    "ly@xmath32  could not be identified because of heavy contamination from the ly@xmath32forest .",
    "was not detected , even in our final , high - s / n spectrum .",
    "figure  5 presents graphically the evolution of the fit parameters of the mini - bal , including ( from top to bottom ) the total rest frame equivalent width at @xmath525346   , the column density , the doppler parameter , the coverage fraction , and the shift velocity .",
    "we discuss each in detail below .    the total rest frame equivalent width increased by about a factor of two over a rest frame time interval of 0.36 years , and then decreased over an interval of 0.6 years . during this entire period ,",
    "the general appearance of the line profile did not change significantly . based on the results of just the first two epochs , misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) speculated that this mini - bal may soon evolve into a bal , with more than 10%  of the flux absorbed over at least a 2,000  range .",
    "this idea is not confirmed by the subsequent epochs , since the mini - bal was found to weaken .",
    "we also monitored the equivalent widths of the narrow and broad components , separately . at first , both components have almost the same equivalent width .",
    "but after epoch  3 , the equivalent width of the broad component was much higher than that of narrow component .",
    "the variability of the column density in the mini - bal is complex .",
    "this is especially true for the broad component , which showed a large increase in column density within 0.13 years , from epoch  3 to epoch  7 , as shown in figure  5 .",
    "this increase in column density was concurrent with the increase of equivalent width , as shown in the top window of the figure .",
    "one possible explanation for this dramatic increase is a change of the ionization state of the gas ( hamann et al .",
    "1997b ; narayanan et al . 2004 ) , which we discuss further in  5 .",
    "an interesting trend is seen in doppler parameter variability . from epoch  3 to epoch  5 ( an interval of 0.09 years in the quasar rest frame ) , the doppler parameter of the broad component increased suddenly from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , and then it decreased gradually .",
    "this abrupt jump is correlated with the sudden increase of the column density in the broad component , as described above . on the other hand ,",
    "the narrow component did not show a significant change in doppler parameter .",
    "the coverage fraction ( assuming it is the same for the narrow and broad components ) shows a variability similar to that of the total equivalent width . after increasing to 0.45",
    ", the coverage fraction decreased to 0.24 .",
    "inspection of the separate contributions of the broad and narrow components to the total equivalent width shows that the coverage fraction evolves similarly to the equivalent width of the narrow component .",
    "if the change of coverage fraction is caused by the absorber s motion across the background flux source , the absorber size is constrained to be smaller than the background source ( about half of the background source because of the maximum  value of @xmath70.5 ) . at the same time",
    ", the column density increased , suggesting an inhomogeneous absorber .",
    "a more detailed discussion will be presented in  5 .",
    "the column density and equivalent width of the broad component increased over the same period ( epoch  3 to epoch  8) as its coverage fraction decreased .",
    "however , since we assumed that the broad and narrow components had the same coverage fractions , we must assess whether this assumption could lead to the observed trends .",
    "specifically , we consider the effect of assuming a constant  for the broad component ( adopting @xmath55 for epoch  3 through epoch  8 , and allowing the narrow component  to change as before ) . this model , which also produced an adequate fit to the data ,",
    "is illustrated with the dotted lines in the 2nd , 3rd , and 4th panels from the top of figure  5 .",
    "for this case , the column density of the broad component does not increase as rapidly , but it still does increase .",
    "the same applies for the equivalent width .",
    "thus our conclusions regarding the evolution of the column density and equivalent width are not qualitatively changed by our assumption about the  value of the broad component .",
    "we have looked for correlated changes in all of the above parameters of the mini - bal profile by plotting them against each other . in figures  6 and 7 , respectively , we show the relevant plots for the narrow and broad components of the mini - bal .",
    "other than a tentative trend between @xmath56 and @xmath35 in figure  6 and between @xmath56 and @xmath57 in figure  7 , we see no convincing correlation . this lack of correlated variability between model parameters is an important clue , which we take into consideration in our later discussion .",
    "the observed shift velocity represents the ejection velocity of the absorber from the central engine projected along the line of sight . while the line center of the narrow component remains nearly constant , the broad component shifts by about 300  ( @xmath58 ) from epoch  1 to epoch  7 .",
    "if this velocity shift is really due to the radiative pressure from the continuum source , the acceleration of the gas can be calculated to be @xmath7 0.01  m  s@xmath59 . however , the measurement of the center of the broad component is highly uncertain , because the observed velocity shift is much smaller than the total line width because of self - blending of the blue and red members of the doublet .",
    "moreover , the center of the broad component moved in both directions ( i.e. , blueward and redward ) during our observations .",
    "although it is still not clear if there is a truly systematic increase in this parameter , we could regard the above value as an upper limit on the acceleration of the absorber .",
    "in addition to the mini - bal system , we detected 8 nal systems in the hs  1603 + 3820 spectra .",
    "for these nals , we do not detect significant variability .",
    "model fit results to the combined spectrum of the 6 subaru observations ( with a total exposure time of 8.9 hours and a s / n per 0.03    pixel of about 91 at @xmath60   ) are consistent with the results based on only the epoch  2 spectrum ( a 1.7 hour exposure with @xmath61 per pixel ; misawa et al .",
    "2005 ) , with only a few small exceptions as described below . in this section",
    "we discuss individual systems , other than system  a ( the mini - bal ) .",
    "the profiles of the lines of these systems are shown on a common velocity scale in figure  4(a  i ) .",
    "system b : :     we fit this strong nal , shown in figure  4a , b , with 15 components ,    although misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used 19 components .",
    "the coverage    fractions of two components , 11 and 14 , deviate from unity by more    than 1@xmath46 , but both are heavily blended with other    components and their  values are not very reliable .",
    "all components in    the nal are consistent with full coverage . only the epoch  8 spectrum    covered the doublet of this system . for the doublet",
    ", only component  7    suggests partial coverage , but the model fit is not good around the    left wing of this component .",
    "we conclude that this system does not    show strong evidence for partial coverage , and is probably an    intervening system , most likely a galaxy because of the strength of    the low - ionization absorption lines .",
    "system c : :     the nal in this system with a simple absorption profile ( see    figure  4c ) is fitted with only one component , as in misawa et al .",
    "both fits are consistent with full coverage .",
    "we also did not    find any evidence for time variability . except for its small shift    velocity ,    @xmath62 ,",
    "there is no evidence to suggest that this system is intrinsic .",
    "system d : :     misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) fitted this system s and profiles with 4 and 2    components , respectively , and did not find any partial coverage .",
    "however , we found an additional component at    @xmath63    from the system center that shows partial coverage , and we have no    reason to suspect systematic error .",
    "the line profiles are shown in    figure  4d .",
    "this component was not studied by misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 )    because of a data defect .",
    "we also now find that component  1 in the nal    possibly shows partial coverage , although it was consistent with full    coverage in the shorter exposure presented by misawa et al .",
    "we    also note that it is surprising that the  @xmath441548 is    black at the position of this component if the partial coverage is    true .",
    "however , the fact that partial coverage is apparent for both a    and a component suggests that this system may be an intrinsic system .",
    "the fact that this system is redshifted from the quasar systemic    redshift also supports this idea .",
    "although this system is located near    the top of the emission line , there is no residual flux at the    position of the doublet for components  4 and 5 .",
    "these components must    therefore cover both the continuum source and broad emission line    region .",
    "we do not see any variability over the course of our    observations .",
    "system e : :     misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) fitted the nal with only two components , and    one of them showed evidence of partial coverage .",
    "however , our    higher - s / n spectrum ( shown in figure  4e ) requires 5 components to fit    the nal , and three of them are consistent with full coverage .",
    "although    components  3 and 5 deviate from full coverage , they are heavily    blended with the other components , so this result is quite uncertain .",
    "the shift velocity of the system is also extremely large ,    @xmath760,000  .",
    "there is no compelling reason to believe    that this system is intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "system f : :     our best - fitting model is almost consistent with the previous one ,    having the same number of components at almost the same positions ( see    figure  4f ) .",
    "all components are consistent with full coverage except    for component  1 that is blended with the strong component  2 .",
    "this    system also has a very large shift velocity , @xmath64 .",
    "we    consider it probable that this is an intervening system .",
    "system g : :     because the nal in this system was positioned at the edge of the    blue ccd of the hds ( around which bad pixels are common ) in some of    our observing setups , the absorption profiles are slightly or severely    different in some spectra .",
    "therefore , we combined only spectra from    epochs  3 , 7 , and 8 ( these are not affected by the data defect ) to    produce a final spectrum for this system ( figure  4 g ) .",
    "we fit the nal    with 6 components , and all of them are consistent with full coverage .",
    "component  5 was not fitted by misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) because of the    unphysical line ratio of the blue and red component , due to line    blending .",
    "this system is probably an intervening system .",
    "system h : :     two components are necessary to fit this nal ( see figure  4h ) .",
    "the    shallower absorption feature , centered on component  2 , has an    unphysical ratio of its blue and red members .",
    "probably the blue member    is contaminated by other lines . only component  1",
    "is useful , and it    yields @xmath65 . in this    system , we again do not see any evidence of intrinsic properties .",
    "system i : :     this system was detected only in the epoch  8 spectrum , because it    was not covered in the other epochs .",
    "we used 7 components to fit the    nal ( see figure  4i ) .",
    "component  4 may show partial coverage , but its    value differs from unity by only slightly more than    1@xmath46 .",
    "the case for partial coverage for component  6    is somewhat more compelling , since the minfit fitting procedure    yielded a value    @xmath66 .",
    "component  4 is not blended with other components , and component  6 is    only weakly blended . although the s / n for this spectrum is not very    high in the relevant region , this system may be another candidate for    an intrinsic system .",
    "in view of the observational constraints derived above , we evaluate here different scenarios for the origin of the variability of the mini - bal . a fundamental assumption underlying",
    "our discussion is that the kinematic components making up system  a represent parcels of absorbing gas at different positions along the line of sight . in effect",
    ", we assume that the absorber is embedded in an accelerating outflow from the quasar , thus the blueshift of a kinematic component increases with its distance from the quasar continuum source .",
    "a very important observational clue from the data presented above is the fact that all the kinematic components of the mini - bal system vary in concert ( i.e. , the depths of all troughs increase or decrease together ) .",
    "these changes appear to be driven largely by changes in the coverage fraction , as shown in figure  5 .",
    "other physical parameters ( @xmath67 and @xmath35 ) are varying as well , but there does not seem to be an obvious correlation between changes of different profile parameters , at least in the bluest troughs of the mini - bal ( see figures 6 and 7 ) .      in misawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) we favored an interpretation in which motion of the ( homogeneous ) absorber across the line ( or cylinder ) of sight causes the observed variability ( see also hamann et al .",
    "the assumed scenario is depicted in the cartoon of figure  2a of hamann & sabra ( 2004 ) . with time , an increasing fraction of the cylinder of sight was covered by the absorber , leading to changes in the coverage fraction . in this context and based on two snapshots of the spectrum , we derived a transverse velocity of 8,000  and a constraint of @xmath68  pc on the distance of the absorber from the continuum source ( see details in misawa et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "that model was motivated largely by the observation that the coverage fraction was the only quantity that changed substantially between the first two observations .",
    "the subsequent observations show that scenario to be too simple , namely the column density of the absorber changes with time as well , suggesting that the absorber is inhomogeneous and its internal structure plays an important role in the variability of the mini - bal profile .",
    "thus , a more plausible scenario is the one depicted in figure  2b of hamann & sabra ( 2004 ) and in figure 5 of de  kool , korista , & arav ( 2002 ) , where the absorbing medium is inhomogeneous , with clumps spanning a range of column densities scattered over the cylinder of sight .",
    "there is a remaining difficulty with this scenario , however .",
    "the fact that all the troughs in the mini - bal vary in concert would require a coincidence between the motions of the individual clumps . more specifically , the projected areas of all the clumps within the cylinder of sight should vary in the same way ( i.e. , rise and fall with time in the same manner for all clumps ) .",
    "we consider such a coordinated sequence of variations rather unlikely , therefore , we regard this interpretation as implausible .",
    "we note that if future observations show this pattern to be common , then this interpretation can be conclusively rejected .      at first glance ,",
    "compression of the absorber might be able to produce a trend similar to that of figure  7b , where the coverage fraction decreases as the column density increases in one of the kinematic components of the mini - bal .",
    "however , on closer examination , such a compression would require highly supersonic motions within the absorber .",
    "assuming the background continuum source size is 0.02  pc ( this is the uv - emitting region of the accretion disk ; see misawa et al .",
    "2005 ) , a change in the coverage fraction from 0.36 to 0.27 within 0.13 years ( epochs 5 and 7 ) implies a speed of order @xmath69 . in comparison ,",
    "the speed of sound in a @xmath70  k gas is only @xmath71 .",
    "thus we consider such a scenario untenable .",
    "the observed partial coverage signature can , in principle , be explained if continuum photons are re - directed by a scattering medium towards the observer , when they were initially traveling in a different direction .",
    "thus , the absorber can be homogeneous and its projected size need not be smaller than the cylinder of sight towards the continuum source .",
    "the dilution of the troughs by photons scattered around the absorber can change with time as the absorber moves relative to the scattering medium or as the conditions in the scattering medium change . in the context of this scenario ,",
    "the _ apparent _ coverage fraction can vary according to the behavior of the scattering medium .",
    "moreover , the variations of the coverage fraction need not be tied in any way to variations of other parameters of the absorber , such as the column density , the @xmath35-parameter , or the shift velocity .",
    "this idea can be tested observationally through spectropolarimetry .",
    "in particular , we would expect the fractional polarization in the absorption mini - bal troughs to be higher than in the continuum ( see the analogous test in bal quasars by brotherton et al .",
    "1997 , ogle et al . 1999 , and lamy & hutsemkers 2000 , for example ) .",
    "furthermore , we would also expect this fractional polarization to increase as the coverage fraction decreases .",
    "changes in the level of the ionizing continuum can also bring about absorption - line variability since they change the relative ionic populations in the absorber ( in this particular case , the relative populations of , and ) . in principle , a monotonic change in the continuum intensity can produce a non - monotonic change in the absorption line strength .",
    "for example , an absorber initially at a low ionization state that sees a rising ionizing flux will first respond with an increase in the strength of its absorption lines ( as @xmath72 ) and then with a decrease ( as @xmath72 ) .",
    "the variability time scale of the absorption lines provides an upper limit on the ionization or recombination time of the absorbing gas , hence its electron density ( see the detailed discussion in hamann et al .",
    "1997b and narayanan et al .",
    "the density limit can be obtained from @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a recombination coefficient and @xmath75 is a variability time scale .",
    "this is a simplified picture in which the gas is in ionization equilibrium and is the dominant ionic species of c.    since the ionic column densities have fluctuated up and down _ more than once _ over the course of our monitoring observations , the ionizing continuum seen by the absorber must be fluctuating too .",
    "moreover , the continuum intensity must be fluctuating by at least a factor of 3 on rest - frame time scales of 6 months or less to produce the observed changes in the ionic column density ( see the calculations of hamann 1997 ) . taking this interpretation at face value ( but see discussion below ) , we can use the shortest variability time scale that we have observed ( 16 days in the quasar rest frame , epochs 5@xmath727 ; see fig .",
    "5 ) to constrain the density of the gas . we consider both an increase and a decrease in the ionization state of the gas as a cause for the observed change in the column density ( i.e. , @xmath72 or @xmath72 ) , with respective recombination coefficients of @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( from arnaud & rothenflugh 1986 ; assuming a nominal gas temperature of 20,000  k , following hamann 1997 ) .",
    "thus we obtain a limit on the electron density of @xmath78 , using the methodology of narayanan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and a bolometric luminosity of @xmath79 ( misawa et al . 2005 ) . to convert this limit to a limit on the distance of the absorber from the continuum source , @xmath80",
    ", we must assume a value of the ionization parameter .",
    "if the column density fluctuations reflect conversions of @xmath81 in a lower - ionization absorber , then the calculations of hamann ( 1997 ) indicate an ionization parameter of @xmath82 and lead to @xmath83  kpc .",
    "if , on the other hand , the column density fluctuations reflect conversions of @xmath81 in a higher - ionization absorber , then the calculations of hamann ( 1997 ) indicate an ionization parameter of @xmath84 and lead to @xmath85  kpc . in this context",
    "the simultaneous variability of all the mini - bal troughs implies that these troughs should represent gas parcels of similar densities for the following reason .",
    "since all absorbing gas parcels must be within the cylinder of sight to the continuum source , the time lag between changes in the continuum intensity at the source and our observation of a change in the mini - bal profile is the sum of the light travel times from the continuum source to the absorber and from the absorber to the observer , plus the recombination time of the gas .",
    "the sum of light travel times is the same regardless of the location of a gas parcel _",
    "along _ the cylinder of sight , therefore , a difference in time lag can only result from different recombination times , i.e. , different gas densities .",
    "we can then conclude that the density does not vary significantly across the line profile , which implies in turn that the shape of the mini - bal profile is determined primarily by the combination of column density ( i.e. , physical thickness ) and coverage fraction as a function of velocity .",
    "fluctuations in the ionization state of the absorber are an attractive explanation of the observed variations in the strength of the mini - bal in hs  1603 + 3820 .",
    "however , the mini - bal appears to vary much faster than any expected variations in the uv continuum of such a luminous quasar ( see for example , giveon et al . 1999 , hawkins 2001 , and kaspi et al .",
    "moreover , fleming & kennefick ( 2006 ) found no variability of this particular quasar in 10 days in the observed frame .",
    "therefore we propose that the variations of the ionizing continuum _ seen by the absorber _",
    "are caused by a screen of variable optical depth between it and the ( relatively steady ) continuum source .",
    "this screen could be the ionized , clumpy , inner part of the outflow , i.e. , the shielding or hitchhiking gas invoked in the outflow models of murray et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and arising naturally in the more detailed calculations of proga et al .",
    "the two - dimensional , axisymmetric models of proga et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also show that disk winds can be accelerated up to 15,000  , and that they are unsteady and generate dense knots periodically . the time variability seen in the mini - bal system of hs  1603 + 3820",
    "may be related to this mechanism .",
    "the conditions in the screen may be similar to those of `` warm '' absorbers , observed in the x - ray spectra of many seyfert galaxies , where it often co - exists with a uv absorber ( e.g. , crenshaw et al .",
    "we note , by way of example , that models for the warm absorbers in ngc  5548 , iras  1339 + 2438 , and ngc  3783 require multiple ionization phases for an adequate fit to the x - ray spectrum ( kaastra et al . 2000 , sako et al .",
    "2001 , blustin et al .",
    "2002 ) , one of which may fulfill the requirements for the inner screen",
    ".    if the optical depth of the screen at wavelengths around the edge is close to unity , then small fluctuations in the column density can cause large changes in the shape and intensity of the transmitted ionizing continuum ( e.g. , fig .",
    "6 of murray et al .",
    "1995 , or fig .  1 of hamann 1995 ) ,",
    "leading to the observed changes in the mini - bal of hs  1603 + 3820 .",
    "this may be analogous to the best - studied warm absorber , in the seyfert galaxy ngc  3783 , where fluctuations in the ionization structure of the absorbing gas have been observed over the course of 6 months ( e.g. , netzer et al .",
    "there is also evidence that the opacity of the warm absorber in ngc  3783 fluctuates over time intervals as short as a month , in response to variations in the x - ray continuum by a factor of 2 ( krongold et al . 2005 ) . within this context",
    "we can also understand why the variations in the coverage fraction of the mini - bal gas are unrelated to variations of its column density .",
    "because both media can be clumpy and since differential rotation of the wind causes the inner screen to move faster than the mini - bal gas across the cylinder of sight , the intensity of the continuum transmitted through the screen and received by the mini - bal gas would vary with time .",
    "moreover , the coverage fraction need not be correlated with the intensity of the transmitted continuum .",
    "we have considered the possibility that one of the observed nal systems at smaller blueshifts relative to the quasar could represent the inner screen . however , none of the three candidate systems , b , c , and d , can satisfy the requirements for the screen .",
    "the very fact that they have absorption lines suggests that their ionization state is too low , and moreover , systems b and d have even lower - ionization lines .",
    "in addition , none of the three systems are variable , which is necessary in order for the screen to perform the desired function .",
    "more promising ways of finding the screen signature are x - ray observations in search of the classic warm absorber feature , and edges .",
    "thus , we will be able to determine which of the ly@xmath32  absorption lines seen at shorter wavelengths might be associated with the screen material .",
    "we have been monitoring the absorption lines in the spectrum of the quasar hs  1603 + 3820 since 2002 , using the subaru and hobby - eberly telescopes .",
    "we have obtained six subaru+hds and two het+mrs spectra spanning an interval of approximately 1.2 years in the quasar rest frame and probing rest - frame time scales as short as 16 days .",
    "we have determined the physical parameters of the 9 absorption - line systems by fitting voigt models to the line profiles .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "we detect one mini - bal and eight nal systems in the quasar spectrum . the partial coverage signature and time variability of the mini - bal show it to be intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "two of the nal systems ( d and i ) may also be intrinsic , based upon our partial coverage analysis .",
    "we are able to fit models only to the bluest portion of the mini - bal profile where self - blending is not severe .",
    "all fit parameters ( i.e. , column density , doppler parameter , coverage fraction , and shift velocity ) as well as the total equivalent width of the system vary significantly with time , even on short time scales",
    ". however , the profile parameters do not appear to change in concert with each other , with one exception : the equivalent widths of all the troughs in this system vary together and approximately follow the variations of the coverage fraction determined from the model fits .",
    "we have examined a number of ways of explaining the above variations of the mini - bal and we have found two viable possibilities .",
    "the first possibility is that the observed partial coverage signature is the result of continuum photons scattering around the absorber and into our cylinder of sight .",
    "the observed changes in mini - bal equivalent widths are thus produced by variations in the scattered continuum that dilutes the absorption troughs . in the second possibility",
    ", the illumination of the uv absorber fluctuates on short time scales by a factor of up to 3 .",
    "we suggest that these fluctuations are caused by a screen of variable optical depth between the mini - bal gas and the continuum source .",
    "this screen might be identified with the shielding gas invoked or predicted in some outflow models .",
    "moreover , it could be analogous to the `` warm '' absorbers observed in the x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies and some quasars .",
    "this picture can also explain the variations in the coverage fraction , which appear to be unrelated to the ionic column density changes .",

    "<S> we use time variability as well as coverage fraction analysis to separate intrinsic absorption lines , which are physically related to the quasar , from intervening absorption lines . by fitting models to the line profiles , we derive the parameters of the respective absorbers as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> only the mini - bal system at @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) shows both partial coverage and time variability , although two nal systems possibly show evidence of partial coverage . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all the troughs of the mini - bal system vary in concert and its total equivalent width variations resemble those of the coverage fraction . </S>",
    "<S> however , no other correlations are seen between the variations of different model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the observed variations can not be reproduced by a simple change of ionization state nor by motion of a homogeneous parcel of gas across the cylinder of sight . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the observed variations are a result of rapid continuum fluctuations , coupled with coverage fraction fluctuations caused by a clumpy screen of variable optical depth located between the continuum source and the mini - bal gas . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative explanation is that the observed partial coverage signature is the result of scattering of continuum photons around the absorber , thus the equivalent width of the mini - bal can vary as the intensity of the scattered continuum changes . </S>"
