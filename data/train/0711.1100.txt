    "because of the lack of local equilibrium the extension of non - equilibrium thermodynamics to a continuous description of an interface is not straightforward . in earlier work @xcite ,",

    "the traditional local equilibrium hypothesis implies that in non - equilibrium a small volume of the system at each moment of time can be considered to be in equilibrium .",
    "thus , all thermodynamic relations , valid for the whole system , remain valid for this small volume .",
    "the important assumption is that the state of each small volume is determined only by the properties of this volume , and no other ones . to describe the interface in equilibrium",
    ", one needs to introduce a dependence on the density gradients however .",
    "such a description is not local in the traditional sense : the system behavior in a small volume depends on the properties of this volume and the properties of the nearest neighborhood .",

    "this is the usual assumption made in non - equilibrium thermodynamics . in the interfacial regions it extends this assumption to places where the gradient contributions become important .",

    "thus , it is necessary to express the cross - coefficients in a form such that we can approximate them using pure - component values . from the equilibrium analysis for the specific quantities per unit of volume",
    "@xcite one can see , that @xmath44 are simply related to the pure - component coefficients .",
    "we will assume then that , for instance , @xmath47 is the coefficient for the pure component @xmath48 .",

    "the matrix @xmath62 is symmetric in it s indexes .    to find the homogeneous specific helmholtz energy @xmath63 we integrate the equations of state over the volume at constant temperature and molar fractions of the components .",
    "the integration constant should be chosen such that the specific helmholtz energy of the system with a small mixture s concentration ( @xmath64 ) is equal to the specific helmholtz energy for a mixture of ideal gases . integrating the equation of state and using eq .   in appendix",
    "[ [ sec / helmholtz / ideal ] ] , we obtain following expression for the homogeneous specific helmholtz energy : @xmath65 where @xmath66 has corresponding expression for each equation of state : @xmath67",
    "we can now derive all hydrodynamic equations , using the conservation laws of matter , momentum and energy . the laws of conservation of mass can be written as @xmath68 the momentum conservation law , or the equation of motion can be written as @xmath69where @xmath70 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "@xmath71 is the thermodynamic pressure tensor defined by eq .",
    "and @xmath72 is the viscous pressure tensor , which still is to be determined .",
    "the viscous pressure tensor without subscripts will be indicated by @xmath73 .",
    "we assume , that this tensor is symmetric .",
    "the law of energy conservation is ( see @xcite ) @xmath74where the total specific energy @xmath75 is given by @xmath76@xmath77 is the gravitational potential field , so that @xmath78 .",

    "we restrict ourself to systems , where the acceleration of the components relative to each other is small compared to the acceleration of the mixture s center of mass .",
    "this implies that the kinetic energy of the components relative motion is small compared to the kinetic energy of the mixture s center of mass motion .",
    "this is true , when the relaxation time of the relative motion is very small . for the common mixtures this is the case .",

    "even though the fluid does not have any preferred direction microscopically , we can not say that it has a 3-dimensional isotropy everywhere , since there are the mesoscopic directions of the density gradient .",
    "the two - phase equilibrium state is not 3-dimensionally isotropic .",
    "a special care should be taken to determine the normal direction to the surface . with the help of the equilibrium analysis one",
    "can obtain the equilibrium densities distributions in the interfacial region .",
    "it is possible therefore to determine the equidensity surfaces , i.e. mathematical surfaces , where either density is constant , and which are normal to the corresponding density gradient .",
    "one may in principal use the gradients of either of the densities to define a direction normal to the surface . for the mixture",
    "we find it more convenient , however , to define a normal using the tension field @xmath86 .",
    "we call the surfaces which are everywhere normal to this vector field the equitensional surfaces .",
    "the thickness of the interfacial region will be assumed to be much smaller then the radii of curvature of these equitensional surfaces . given this assumption",
    "the tension vector field in good approximation does not change it s direction through the interface .",
    "thus , it is possible to speak about the normal vector @xmath87 on the surface , which is parallel to the tension vector in this region .",
    "this allows us to speak about the symmetry of the surface .",
    "if the surface curvature is the same in both directions , parallel to the surface , a small surrounding of the normal through the interfacial region is invariant for any rotations around and reflections with respect to this normal . thus we can say , that such a system has a local 2-dimensional isotropy .",
    "we shall refer to such a property of the interfacial region as the 2-dimensional isotropy of the surface . if the two radii of curvature differ , surface is not 2-dimensionally isotropic any more . for a surface which is thin compared to the radii of curvature one can , in a good approximation , consider it to be 2-dimensionally isotropic .",
    "we assume this to be the case for the systems we will consider .",
    "if the system has 3-dimensional(3d ) isotropy , then coupling occurs only between forces and fluxes of the same 3d tensorial character . for an interfacial region , which is 2-dimensionally(2d )",
    "isotropic , coupling occurs only between forces and fluxes of the same 2d tensorial character .",
    "thus , phenomenological coefficients must remain unchanged under rotations and reflections with respect to the direction normal to the surface .",

    "one can split the vectorial and tensorial quantities into the normal and parallel components with respect to the normal vector @xmath87 on the surface .",
    "we use the subscripts @xmath95 and @xmath96 for this quantities . because of 2d - isotropy of the surface",
    ", these quantities reveal the scalar , vectorial or the tensorial behavior under rotations around and reflections with respect to this normal in a 2d space ( we refer to appendix  [ [ sec/2din3d ] ] for the details ) .",

    ".   we can write the entropy production for a 2d - isotropic surface as the sum of 2-dimensional scalar , vectorial and tensorial contributions @xmath112 where @xmath113 .    the linear force - flux equations for the scalar force - flux pairs are @xmath114 for the vectorial force - flux pairs they are @xmath115 and for the tensorial force - flux pairs they are @xmath116 all the resistivities @xmath117 and conductivities @xmath118 are scalars .",
    "one can easily invert the resistivity matrix @xmath117 and write the corresponding relations for the fluxes using the conductivities @xmath118 , and vice versa .    for flat surfaces",
    "it was found @xcite that the resistivities are additive in the normal direction to the surface while the conductivities are additive in the parallel direction .",
    "we therefore consider it convenient to write the force - flux relations in the given form .",
    "the onsager relations for the phenomenological coefficients are the following .",
    "@xmath119 as the ordinary onsager relations , these are the consequence of the microscopic time reversal invariance .    as usual the values of the phenomenological coefficients locally will depend on the local thermodynamic variables .",
    "these are the local concentrations , @xmath120 , @xmath5 , and the temperature , @xmath1 . in the gradient theory the density gradients are also considered as local thermodynamic variables . in view of this the phenomenological coefficients",
    "may also depend on the gradients of the densities .",
    "the values of the phenomenological coefficients and their functional dependence on the thermodynamic variables are not given by the mesoscopic theory .",
    "they should be either calculated from statistical mechanical considerations , or from experiments , either real or computer .",
    "while they are well investigated for homogeneous fluids and fluid mixtures , such data are not available for the surface coefficients of fluid mixtures .",
    "we shall use the following expression for each of the resistivity coefficients @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the resistivities for the coexisting homogeneous phases in the equilibrium state . here",
    "@xmath124 is the order parameter , typically this is just the density @xmath120 or the molar concentration @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath126 is the equilibrium profile and @xmath127 is the maximum value of the gradient of this profile .",
    "the first two terms are just a smooth transition of the resistivity from the value in the one phase to the value in the other phase .",
    "this is the first natural assumption for the resistivity profile .",
    "the origin of the third term comes from the assumption of an excess resistivity in the interfacial region .",
    "particularly one can observe this fact in the molecular dynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "the exact form of this term may be debated .",
    "it was chosen to model a rise of the resistivity in the interfacial region .",
    "the @xmath128 factor makes this term significant only in the interfacial region .",
    "it is scaled with @xmath129 in order to make this factor dimensionless and not far from unity .",
    "the @xmath130 factor gives the average value of the resistivity of both phases .",
    "the dimensionless factor @xmath131 determines the magnitude of this effect .",
    "the homogeneous resistivities @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the known functions of the mass fraction and the temperature along the plane of coexistence .    for the conductivities used in eq .   and",
    "eq .   one may use expressions analogous to eq .  .",
    "the conductivities along the surface are expected to be additive @xcite .",
    "thus it is important to use this equation for the conductivities and not for the resistivities along the surface . in this respect",
    "it is important to note that @xmath131 may in principle be negative as long as the corresponding @xmath117 and @xmath118 remain everywhere positive . for the resistivity this would describe an interfacial region with a lower resistivity and for the conductivities it would describe an interfacial region with a lower conductivity . below we will only consider positive @xmath131 s .",
    "in order to illustrate the results , which one can obtain using the above procedure , we have applied it to a special case .",
    "this requires a number of approximations , connected with the specific mixture and the geometry .",
    "we consider a flat liquid - vapor interface of the binary mixture of cyclohexane ( 1^st^ component ) and @xmath15-hexane ( 2^nd^ component ) in non - equilibrium stationary conditions .",
    "we only consider fluxes and gradients in the direction normal to the surface .",

    "together with the gibbs relation and the balance equation for the entropy density , we were then able to obtain explicit expressions for the entropy flux and the entropy production not only in the homogeneous phases but also in the interfacial region .",
    "this identifies the conjugate thermodynamic forces and fluxes in the interfacial region .",
    "this made it possible to give the general force - flux relations in this region .",
    "the explicit form of these equations depends on the symmetry of the system .",
    "we discuss why one can consider a fluid - fluid interface to be two - dimensional isotropic . due to",
    "the curie principle coupling occurs only between 2-dimensionally isotropic scalars , vectors and tensors of the same rank in such a system .",
    "the resulting force - flux relations in the interfacial region are accordingly simplified and given .",
    "interesting is that the components of the fluxes normal to the surface are scalar and couple therefore to reactions in the interfacial region .",
    "this is related to active transport , a phenomenon of great importance .",
    "we do not explicitly consider reacting system in this paper , but may do this in a future publication . having all these equations the non - equilibrium description of the surface is complete .",
    "we applied the description to the special case of stationary heat and mass transport through and into a surface .",
    "transport along the surface is in many respects like a 2-dimensional analog of flow in a homogeneous medium .",
    "the presence of the surface has more influence on transports in the normal direction .",
    "we find that there is for instance a strong effect of the surface on the temperature and the concentration profiles .",
    "this effect increases when we increase the contribution proportional to the square gradient of the order parameter to the resistivity in the interfacial region .",
    "we conclude that the description we have given , using an extension of the square gradient model , will be a useful tool to study many details of the dynamics of evaporation and condensation in multi - component systems .",
    "non - equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations of evaporation and condensation could obtain density , mass fraction and temperature profiles .",
    "we expect the comparison of these profiles with the present model to be very useful .",
    "in particular , this will give insight in the size and possible density , mass fraction and temperature dependence of the coefficient @xmath155 .",
    "in this manner we expect the model to form a bridge between the microscopic description using non - equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations and the discrete macroscopic description using the excess densities introduced by gibbs @xcite . in a following paper",
    "we intend to investigate whether the discrete description satisfies the local equilibrium assumption for an arbitrary choice of the dividing surface , a property which was verified for one - component systems @xcite .",
    "this would be a rather remarkable result , given the fact that the continuous description does not obey this property . for a systematic development of the non - equilibrium thermodynamic description of surfaces",
    "this property is essential @xcite .",
    "for the specific helmholtz energy the ordinary gibbs relation in equilibrium was found to be @xmath156spatial gibbs relations in equilibrium was found to be @xmath157 one may wonder why we use the gibbs relations for the specific internal energy , not for the specific helmholtz energy , to extend them to non - equilibrium analysis .",
    "following the same procedure , as in subsec .",
    "[ [ sec / gradient / nonequilibrium ] ] , we can extend the gibbs relations for the specific helmholtz energy to non - equilibrium in the following way @xmath158@xmath159 for the ordinary gibbs relations , like in homogeneous description , there is no preference in the thermodynamic potential",
    ". provided eq .  , equilibrium ordinary gibbs relations eq .   and eq .   are equivalent .",
    "the non - equilibrium relation between these potentials @xmath160 makes non - equilibrium ordinary gibbs relations eq .   and",
    "eq .   also to be equivalent .",
    "the situation is different for the spatial gibbs relations , however .",
    "provided eq .  , equilibrium spatial gibbs relations eq .   and",
    "eq .   are also equivalent .",
    "the non - equilibrium relation eq .   between these potentials makes , however , non - equilibrium spatial gibbs relations eq .   and eq .   to be _ not _ equivalent .",
    "the reason for that is that the equilibrium spatial gibbs relation for the specific helmholtz energy does not contain the term , proportional to @xmath161 , since @xmath162 in equilibrium . in non - equilibrium @xmath163 and , as one can see from eq .   and eq .",
    ", @xmath164 contains such a term .",
    "we see , that the gibbs relations for the specific internal energy describe the system more adequately since they do not suffer from the unaccounted effect of possible temperature changes . because of this reason we should use the gibbs relations for the specific internal energy , not the specific helmholtz energy , to extend them to non - equilibrium .",
    "as in sec .  [ [ sec / curie2d ] ] we shall use the special notation for the tensorial quantities of different order and different behavior in this section .",
    "any tensorial quantity is denoted as @xmath88 . here",
    "@xmath89 indicates the dimensionality of the space , in which the quantity is being considered , and can be either 3 or 2 here .",
    "@xmath90 indicates the rank of the tensorial quantity , and can be @xmath91 for scalar , @xmath92 for vectorial or @xmath93 for tensorial quantities .",
    "for example , @xmath165 indicates the 2-dimensional tensor , i.e. the quantity @xmath166 , where @xmath167 are numbers , and @xmath168 indicates the 3-dimensional vector , i.e. the quantity @xmath169 , where @xmath170 are numbers .",
    "scalars are the numbers irrespectively of the dimensionality of the space , so they will be denoted simply by @xmath171 .",
    "some quantities reveal the tensorial behavior of a some rank in @xmath89-dimensional space only under some specified transformations , while in general they do nt . in this section",
    "we are interested only in rotations around and reflections with respect to some constant vector @xmath172 in 3-dimensional space",
    ". we will denote quantities which reveal the tensorial behavior of rank @xmath90 under these transformations by @xmath173 .",
    "we show how in presence of the constant vector @xmath172 one can split the tensorial quantity @xmath174 into a combination of the tensorial quantities @xmath175 . without loss of generality",
    "we will assume that @xmath176 .    from 3d vector @xmath177",
