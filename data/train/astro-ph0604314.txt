    "ae aqr is a bright ( @xmath2 ) , nova - like cataclysmic binary consisting of a magnetic white dwarf primary and a k45 v secondary with a long 9.88 hr orbital period and the shortest known white dwarf spin period @xmath3 s @xcite .",
    "although originally classified and interpreted as a disk - accreting dq her star @xcite , ae aqr displays a number of unusual features that are not naturally explained by this model .",
    "first , violent flaring activity is observed in the radio , optical , ultraviolet , x - ray , and tev @xmath4-rays .",
    "second , the balmer emission lines are single peaked and produce doppler tomograms that are not consistent with those of an accretion disk .",
    "third , the white dwarf is spinning down at a rate @xmath5 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , de jager ) .",
    "although this corresponds to the small rate of change of @xmath6 , ae aqr s spin - down is typically characterized as `` rapid '' because the characteristic time @xmath7 yr , which is short compared to the lifetime of the binary , and because the spin - down luminosity @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the white dwarf moment of inertia , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the white dwarf mass and radius , respectively , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ) , which exceeds the secondary s thermonuclear luminosity by an order of magnitude and the accretion luminosity by two orders of magnitude .",
    "given this , ae aqr could be thought of as being powered primarily by the ultimate in clean energy sources : a flywheel .",
    "because of its unique properties and variable emission across the electromagnetic spectrum , ae aqr has been the subject of numerous studies , including an intensive multiwavelength observing campaign in 1993 october ( * ? ? ? * and the series of papers in aspc 85 ) . based on these studies , ae aqr is now widely believed to be a former supersoft x - ray binary @xcite and current _ magnetic propeller _ @xcite , with most of the mass lost by the secondary being flung out of the binary by the magnetic field of the rapidly rotating white dwarf . these models",
    "explain many of ae aqr s unique characteristics , including the fast spin rate and rapid secular spin - down rate of the white dwarf , the anomalous spectral type of the secondary , the anomalous c to n abundance @xcite , the absence of signatures of an accretion disk @xcite , the violent flaring activity @xcite , and the origin of the radio and tev @xmath4-ray emission @xcite .    to build on this observational and theoretical work , while taking advantage of a number of improvements in observing capabilities , during 2005 august 28september 2 a group of professional and amateur astronomers conducted a campaign of multiwavelength ( radio , optical , ultraviolet , x - ray , and tev @xmath4-ray ) observations of ae aqr .",
    "analyses of these data are ongoing , but here we present a fundamental result  the spin period of the white dwarf  that relies solely on photometric data from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and archival data from _ asca _  and _ xmm - newton_.",
    "ae aqr was observed by _ asca _  with the gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ) detectors and the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) detectors beginning on 1995 october 14 at 00:16 ut for 82 ks ( sequence number 33005000 ) , by",
    "_ xmm _  with the european photon imaging collaboration ( epic ) pn ccd detector beginning on 2001 november 7 at 23:47 ut for 14 ks ( obsid 0111180201 ) , and by _ chandra _  with the high - energy transmission grating ( hetg ) and the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) detector beginning on 2005 august 30 at 06:37 ut for 81 ks ( obsid 5431 ) .",
    "the _ asca _  and",
    "_ xmm _  data have been previously discussed by @xcite ; osborne [ 2002 , unpublished presentation at the third magnetic cataclysmic variable workshop ( iau coll .  190 ) ] ; and @xcite .",
    "the _ asca _  and _ xmm _  data and the _ chandra _  data were extracted from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center and the _ chandra _  data archive , respectively .",
    "the data files used for subsequent analysis were the _ asca _  gis and sis screened bright mode event files , the _ xmm _  epic pn pipeline processed event file , and the _ chandra _  level 2 pipeline processed event file .",
    "the data in these files were manipulated as follows .",
    "first , all times were converted from spacecraft time to terrestrial time ( tt ) and corrected to the solar system barycenter using the _ asca _  ftools v6.0 tool timeconv , the _ xmm _  science analysis software ( sas ) v6.5.0 tool barycen , and the _ chandra_interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) v3.2 tool axbary .",
    "the barycentric corrections produced by these different software packages were checked against those of the interactive data language ( idl ) procedure barycen ( which does not by default account for the varying light travel time between the satellite and the center of earth ) , and were found to agree within 40 , 210 , and 200 ms for _ asca _ , _ xmm _ , and _ chandra _ , respectively , consistent with the size of each satellite s orbit .",
    "second , source and background events were extracted from the event files using custom idl software . for _ chandra _",
    ", events were collected from the zeroth order image and the @xmath14 first order dispersed spectrum using the region masks in the level 2 pha file .",
    "third , event times @xmath15 were converted to white dwarf orbit and spin phases via the relations @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 d , and @xmath25 are the white dwarf orbit and spin ephemeris constants from table 4 of de jager . in the expression for @xmath26 , but it amounts to an insignificant @xmath27 cycles at the time of the _ chandra _  observation . ]",
    "fourth , filters were applied to restrict attention to events from two orbital cycles for _ asca _  and _ chandra _  and @xmath28 of an orbital cycle centered on @xmath29 for _ xmm_. the resulting range of orbit phases and observation dates are listed in table 1 .",
    "fifth , background - subtracted spin phase folded count rate light curves were calculated and fit with the cosine function @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mean count rate , @xmath32 is the pulse semiamplitude , and @xmath33 is the phase offset ( expressed in cycles @xmath34 in what follows ) . given that the optical , ultraviolet , and x - ray spin pulses are aligned in phase @xcite , @xmath33 should be equal to zero to within the uncertainty of the de jager spin ephemeris , if the ephemeris remains valid at the times of the _ asca _ , _ xmm _ , and _",

    "the trend displayed in figure 3 of the difference between the observed and calculated ae aqr white dwarf spin phases is steeper than can be explained by an increase in either the value of the @xmath35 parameter or the size of the parameter uncertainties in the de jager spin ephemeris . given the limited baseline and the limited amount of x - ray data , the observed trend is consistent with the addition to the ephemeris of either a @xmath36 term centered on @xmath37 or an additional @xmath35 term centered on a late date @xmath38 . in the first case , the taylor expansion of the spin frequency @xmath39 results in a cubic term in the expansion for @xmath40 @xcite , so @xmath41 and the optical and x - ray data are consistent with @xmath42 or @xmath43 . in the second case ,",
    "@xmath44 and the x - ray data are consistent with @xmath45 and @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "( in both cases , the quoted errors account for the error in the de jager spin ephemeris . ) of the two options , the quadratic fit is preferred , since it provides a slightly better fit to the data and produces phase residuals that are smaller ( @xmath48 cycles for the quadratic term compared to @xmath49 for the cubic term ) during the epoch studied by de jager ( 1978.51992.6 ) . in either case ,",
    "the frequency derivatives are negative and the period derivatives are positive , so during the epoch covered by the _",
    "asca _ , _ xmm _ , and _ chandra_x - ray observations ( 1995.82005.7 ) , the white dwarf in ae aqr was braking ( slightly ) harder than described by the de jager spin ephemeris .",

    "x - ray observations spread over 10 yrs ; and a cumulative 27 yr baseline , we have found that in recent years the white dwarf in ae aqr is spinning down at a rate that is slightly faster than predicted by the de jager spin ephemeris . at the present time , the observed period evolution is consistent with either a cubic term in the spin ephemeris with @xmath50 centered on @xmath37 or an additional quadratic term with @xmath51 centered on @xmath52 .",
    "we consider the implications of each option in turn .",
    "if the observed @xmath53 residuals are due to a cubic term in the spin ephemeris , it is possible to make an interesting comparison between the ae aqr white dwarf x - ray pulsar and neutron star radio pulsars . in a vacuum ,",
    "a rotating star with a misaligned magnetic dipole loses rotational kinetic energy via magnetic - dipole radiation at a rate @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the magnetic moment , @xmath32 is the surface magnetic field strength , @xmath56 is the stellar radius , and @xmath57 is the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes .",
    "it is convenient to express this as @xmath58 with @xmath59 and the so - called braking index @xmath60 .",
    "ignoring the fact that the white dwarf in ae aqr is not isolated [ the light cylinder radius ( @xmath61 cm ) is comparable to the binary separation ( @xmath62 cm ) , so the white dwarf magnetic field will drag against the secondary , the magnetic field of the secondary , and the mass lost by the secondary ] , if one assumes that the observed spin - down is due solely to magnetic - dipole radiation losses , one obtains that @xmath63 or @xmath64 mg @xcite , comparable to that observed in polars .",
    "however , one also obtains @xmath65 or @xmath66 , which results is a _ decrease _ in @xmath53 by 0.1 cycles in @xmath67 yrs , while we have observed an _ increase _ in @xmath53 by 0.24 cycles in 27 yrs . expressed another way ,",
    "we have derived not @xmath60 but @xmath68 . clearly , the enhanced spin - down of the white dwarf in ae aqr has nothing to do with magnetic - dipole radiation losses . on the other hand ,",
    "if the observed @xmath53 residuals are due to an additional quadratic term in the spin ephemeris , the spin - down rate is a modest @xmath69 per cent greater than the rate derived by de jager , which easily could be accommodated by , e.g. , a small increase in the mass transfer rate from the secondary , leading to an enhanced spin - down torque on the white dwarf .    while we have found that additional low - order terms in the taylor series expansion of the white dwarf spin ephemeris adequately fit the trend of the @xmath53 residuals of the _ asca _ , _ xmm _ , and _",
    "chandra _",
    "x - ray light curves of ae aqr , providing independent evidence of the nominal validity of the de jager ephemerides , we caution that our results are based on only three data points spread over 10 yrs .",
    "first , it is possible that the spin evolution of ae aqr is more complex than assumed , that @xmath53 varies on shorter timescales and manifests larger excursions than sampled , and that the good quadratic and cubic fits to the @xmath53 residuals of the x - ray data are fortuitous .",
    "second , the quadratic and cubic spin ephemerides of  3 should be used with caution , since they have yet to be shown to have any _ predictive _ capability .",
    "regular monitoring , in the optical , ultraviolet , and/or x - rays , is required to track the evolution of the ae aqr pulse period , to determine if the white dwarf continues to spin down at the current rate , or if ( as seems likely ) it varies stochastically in response to changes in the mass - transfer rate , the varying efficiency of the magnetic propeller ( e.g. , the fraction of the mass - transfer rate that is expelled from the binary versus that accreted by the white dwarf ) , etc .",
