    "each of the seven receivers measures two linear polarizations ( x and y ) and produces two corresponding if channels ( each @xmath8  ghz ) . out of the four possible cross - correlations with a pair of receivers ,",

    "we found the instrumental delays for all if channels using relative delay measurements .",
    "short cables were then inserted into each if for compensation . after this trimming procedure",
    "the residual delays were measured by fitting fringes for the sun without the dishes , modeling the fringes as the convolution of the observed point source fringe with a circular disk .",
    "the differences between observation and model are consistent with residual delays of @xmath49  ps ( rms ) . except for the delays",
    "due to platform deformation , the delays between antennas were therefore well controlled .",
    "the amiba correlator has four lags and outputs two spectral bands to cover the @xmath8  ghz band . knowing the bandpass shape is an important aspect of obtaining good visibilities using this type of correlator ( see next section ",
    "[ sec : lag2vis ] ) .",
    "because the analog correlator contributes significantly to the bandpass shape , we adopted a baseline - based measurement approach .",

    "the conversion from observed fringe rate to the rf frequency is proportional to the noise source translation speed .",
    "we believe a @xmath53  % jitter is present in the translation stage we used , which introduced roughly @xmath53  ghz uncertainty in the response frequency .",
    "this causes one of the major problem in developing an accurate visibility extraction method from our lag data ( see  [ sec : lag2vis ] ) .",
    "an improved measurement setup involving simultaneous injection of a single frequency source is being developed to achieve a higher accuracy .",
    "the effective bandwidths , defined as @xmath54 , are insensitive to the uncertainty in the response frequency . based on our bandpass measurements ,",

    "they generally fall in the range of @xmath55  ghz .",
    "+      several approaches can be used to convert the four measured lags of the amiba correlator into complex visibilities in two bands over the 16  ghz bandwidth .",
    "we find that the inaccuracies inherent in this inversion need to be corrected by external calibration . here we adopt the formalism of @xcite ( see * ? ? ? * for an alternative formalism ) . the lag output in equation  ( [ eq : tstage ] )",
    "can be expressed in matrix form as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the source visibility .",
    "subscript @xmath58 indexes the @xmath59 lags , and subscript @xmath12 indexes the @xmath60 discretized frequency samples @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is usually much larger than @xmath63 .",

    "the kernel is integrated in frequency into two bands @xmath66 , where @xmath67 indexes the real and imaginary parts of the two bands .",
    "we use the inverse of the integrated kernel to construct the raw visibility @xmath68 .",
    "ideally we would like @xmath69 so that @xmath70 is closest to @xmath71 .",
    "however , when @xmath64 is an inaccurate representation of @xmath65 , due to measurement errors , variations with temperature or time , insufficient spectral resolution in the measurement , or insufficient information about the response , errors in visibilities occur .",
    "[ fig : lag2vis ] demonstrates the calculation of raw visibility using simulated drift scans in three cases when ( 1 ) the kernel is the exact response , ( 2 ) there are measurement errors , and ( 3 ) there is no knowledge about the response .",
    "the correct visibility should appear as a gaussian in amplitude with a linearly increasing phase .",
    "it can be seen that case ( 1 ) recovers the correct result , whereas deviations from this form increase with decreasing accuracy of the kernel .",
    "we therefore must obtain a calibrated visibility from the raw visibility @xmath72 , where @xmath73 has the same index range as @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the calibration matrix , which can be obtained by comparing the raw visibility of a planet ( the calibrator ) to the theoretical visibility .    in the analysis of data taken in 2007 and 2008 , the flat kernel",

    "we have estimated the errors introduced by external calibration by running simulations on point source models .",
    "this error is on the order of @xmath76% ( 1@xmath77 ) in the absolute fluxes with no detectable bias .",
    "this is small compared to the thermal noise and the measurement errors on the planet itself .",
    "the stability of the system was examined by measuring the variation in visibilities for a few bright planets during local times 8  pm to 8  am , as normally used for observing . for this test",
    ", the ephemerides of the planets were taken at the beginning of each track but not updated during the observation .",
    "this causes a pointing error that increases to about an arcminute over 12  hours . to account for this ,",
    "two sets of visibility data for each planet were chosen as calibrating events .",
    "a linear interpolation was used to remove the linear drift . for data without bracketing events ,",
    "the nearest calibration was used .",
    "[ fig : stability ] shows an example of a stability measurement .",
    "the gain stability was found to have an rms variation around 5% , and the phase to have an rms variation around 0.1  rad .",
    "the measurements also reveal that the phase response is more sensitive to changes in environment than the gain response , especially in the first hour after shelter opening .",
    "fig.[fig : jupflux ] plots the flux of jupiter recovered from the data set used in fig.[fig : stability ] .",
    "data was calibrated by the first measurement at ut  12h ( not plotted ) .",
    "the recovered flux varied within @xmath78% of the expected flux until sunrise .",
    "calculation of the calibrator flux is discussed in ",
    "[ sec : calibrator ] .    based on the stability measurements , we chose to use a calibration interval of two to three hours , to give calibrations good to about 5% in gain and 0.1  rad in phase for each baseline .",
    "calibration requires @xmath79% of telescope observing time .",
    "+      the signal in the lag output should be constant when amiba tracks a source .",
    "however , the weak signal we measure is susceptible to slowly - varing contamination .",
    "the system is designed with a phase switching and demodulation scheme to remove contamination such as a common mode leakage in the if paths . to modulate the signal",
    ", we use a pin switch to change the lo between two carefully adjusted delay lines , and thus changes the phase of if signal by 180@xmath80 .",
    "the demodulation is done in the readout process .",
    "the aim was to remove contamination between the down - conversion mixer and the correlator readout .",
    "however , mixers in the correlator can pick up higher - order signals such as @xmath81 in addition to their nominal output , which is proportional to @xmath82 or @xmath83 , where @xmath84 stands for the voltage from ant@xmath85 . if the power of the if signal is modulated by the phase switching pattern , then this higher order response can generate an output that is coherent with the demodulation pattern and becomes a spurious signal .",
    "this effect is , indeed , seen in amiba , where phase switching of the lo can result in a power difference as large as @xmath86  db .",
    "the lo power modulation is carried through to the if in varying amounts depending on the mean lo power level at the mixer .",
    "the if modulation can be undetectable for optimally - tuned mixers , but is up to @xmath87  db for under - pumped mixers .    to reduce the if modulation , the lo drive level is optimized for minimum conversion loss for each mixer .",
    "modulation of the lo power would then have the least impact on the if power .",
    "furthermore , to reduce the drifting of lo level with ambient temperature changes , the final amplifier and frequency doubler in the lo chain are operated in the soft saturation regime .",
    "additional protection is provided by temperature controls installed before the 2009 observing season .",
    "spurious signals external to the system , such as ground pickup , will still affect the data .",
    "we used a subtraction scheme similar to the one used by cbi @xcite to suppress the slowly - varying signals . in practice",
    ", we have found that the spurious signal in individual patches in @xmath885  hrs integration can be as high as @xmath89  jy / beam , but that after subtraction a cluster with brightness 0.3  jy can be detected at @xmath90 level in 11  hours ( i.e. , with 5.5  hours on - source integration ) . the observing strategy and the data analysis are given in @xcite .",
    "for each baseline , losses include the antenna loss , antenna misalignment , and the correlation loss . the antenna loss is mainly related to our cassegrain design .",
    "@xcite calculate the overall antenna efficiency to be 0.58 for the 1.2  m and 60  cm dishes alike .",
    "the loss originates mainly from three factors : the illumination efficiency , the secondary blockage , and the forward spillover .",
    "the amiba feeds provide a gaussian illumination pattern and the the reflectors are designed to have a -10.5  db edge taper .",
    "compared to an uniformly illuminated reflector , only 90% of the dish is effectively used . the shadow of the secondary mirror blocks about 8% of the collecting area , giving a loss of 0.92 .",
    "the edge of the secondary corresponds to the edge of the primary mirror .",
    "therefore the illumination is either reflected by the primary to the sky or is emitted toward the sky direcly .",
    "the latter part constitutes about 22% of the energy giving the forward spillover factor of 0.78 .",
    "we favored a design with slightly worse forward spillover but little to none backward spillover ( illumination toward the ground ) to reduce system temperature .",
    "the antenna misalignment consists of the mechanical installation error and the dynamical deformation of the platform .",
    "the former error was measured to be around @xmath91 during the 2007 observing season ( wu et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) and will be improved for future observations .",
    "the latter error was inferred from photogrammetry measurements of the platform surface to be less than 1  @xcite .",
    "the two errors together attenuate the primary beam by 2% .",
    "antenna misalignment may also cause pointing errors for some baselines .",
    "this effect is not considered in individual baseline efficiencies but will be considered in the array efficiency .",
    "there is also a loss of efficiency from the noise contributed by the rejected correlations in the analog correlator .",
    "the estimated correlation efficiency from this effect is 0.81 .    when combining baselines from the entire array , pointing error and system stability also lower the efficiency by degrading the coherence of signal from different measurements .",
    "the pointing error is less than 0.4  @xcite and decreases the efficiency by less than 2% .",
    "the large alignment error , on the other hand , contributes as much as 12% loss in the 2007 and 2008 observations . as described in ",
    "[ sec : stability ] , the system stability is approximately @xmath92 in gain and @xmath93  rad in phase . taken over all baselines",
    "this results in a reduction of signal by about 2% .",

    "an average effective bandwidth of @xmath102  ghz was assumed in the calculation .",
    "the measured efficiency scatters from 0.2 to 0.5 with an error bar of approximately 0.2 .",
    "the error originates mainly from the noise estimation of the signal - dominant fringe , the occasional large readout noise , and also the variation of effective bandwidth",
    ". the overall array efficiency will be covered in  [ sec : snr ] .",
    "the raw visibilities recovered from the lag data have the systematic losses discussed above and are further affected by instrumental delay , gain drift , phase variation as well as the imperfect lag - to - visibility transformation .",
    "we calibrate visibilities by interspersed two - patch observations of a planet .",
    "this converts our visibility amplitudes to flux density units and references the phase to the calibrating planet position .",
    "taking planet data with the subtraction scheme , and applying the same calibration scheme used for cluster data ( one calibration about every three hours ) , we find that the recovered peak flux in the image domain shows an rms scatter of about 3%",
    ".    the flux densities of the planets are calculated from published disk brightness temperatures and the apparent angular sizes assuming a black - body spectrum .",
    "we adopt the values : jupiter 171.8@xmath1031.7 k @xcite , saturn 149.3@xmath1034.1 k @xcite , and mars 206.8@xmath1035.6 k @xcite .",

    "the scatter of the jupiter flux densities agrees with the scatter in one night as shown in fig.[fig : jupflux ] .",
    "the flux density of saturn is systematically lower than the calculated value by approximately @xmath104 .",
    "it was verified that the lower flux was not the result of an error in flux standard .",
    "this was checked by artificially setting the phase error to zero in the calibrated visibilities of saturn and forming an image . the recovered flux density displays",
    "no systematic offset from the calculated level , to within the error bound .",
    "the apparent deficit in the flux density for saturn is likely due to insufficient phase calibration in the 2007 data , when calibrations more than two  hours apart were often used .",
    "note that the effect of saturn s ring is not included in the calculation of saturn s flux density .",
    "the ring inclination was about -15  deg for the 2007 observations and about -10  deg for the 2008 observations .",
    "we estimate that our flux density scale is good to about @xmath105% in absolute terms .",
    "based on jupiter s flux scale , our measurement of saturn s disk brightness temperature is @xmath2  k.    a final note about calibration is on the difference of spectra between the calibrator and the sz effect .",
    "our primary calibrators , jupiter and saturn , are dominated by thermal emission near 94  ghz .",
    "the black - body spectrum favors slightly higher frequency than does the sze spectrum .",
    "regardless of the choice of assumed passband shape , the difference of effective central frequency , defined by @xmath106/[\\int_{{\\mathrm band}}r(f)s(f)df]$ ] with @xmath107 being the source spectrum and @xmath108 being the passband , is less than 1.5% of the bandwidth .",
    "its effect on the calibration is thus negligible compared to other errors .",
    "based on the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of jupiter s fringe and the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : efficiency ] , we find that the array has an overall efficiency of about 0.4 .",
    "the improvement in sensitivity with integration time depends critically on the removal of spurious signals using the subtraction scheme and subsequent data flagging . to verify the sensitivity",
    ", we examine the variation of signal and noise in the reconstructed map with integration time in figure [ fig : snr_int ] .",
    "the integration time here refers to the accumulation of observing time spent in each individual visibility band . for example , when the telescope tracks a source for 3 minutes , the total integration time for 21 baselines , 2 polarizations , and 2 bands is @xmath109  sec  @xmath110  sec . since the visibilities are used with non - uniform weights in forming the image , we calculate an effective integration time , which for 3 minutes on - source integration is defined as @xmath111  sec , where @xmath112 denotes the weighting given to each data set . in this analysis ,",

    "the cleaned signal at the source position is also recorded , while the residual noise is measured in the 1 deg image excluding the inner clean region .",
    "figure  [ fig : snr_int ] shows that an efficiency @xmath118 is more representative for the current data , giving a point source sensitivity of @xmath119  mjy in 1  hour of on - source integration when the subtraction scheme is applied .",

    "the loss of 40% of observing time is mostly due to lower weighting applied to some receivers or baselines experiencing hardware problems .",
    "there were very few observations made when the weather was not good in the 2007 and 2008 observing season .",
    "the flux density error consists of the calibrator flux scale uncertainty of @xmath105  % , and the cross - calibration error @xmath126 , which also includes the lag - to - visibility flux scale error of @xmath127 .",

    "<S> beam switching was used to cancel instrumental instabilities and ground pick up . </S>",
    "<S> total power and phase stability were good on time scales of hours , and the system was shown to integrate down on equivalent timescales of 300 hours per baseline / correlation , or about 10 hours for the entire array . while the broadband correlator leads to good sensitivity , the small number of lags in the correlator resulted in poorly measured bandpass response . </S>",
    "<S> we corrected for this by using external calibrators ( jupiter and saturn ) . using jupiter as the flux standard </S>",
    "<S> , we measured the disk brightness temperature of saturn to be @xmath2  k. </S>"
