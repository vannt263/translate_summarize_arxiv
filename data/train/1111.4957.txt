    "therefore has approximately @xmath264 ev  , which suggests that larger values of @xmath231 may indeed be more appropriate .",
    "obviously , experiments and/or ab initio calculations should be carried out to clarify the parameters values .    in conclusion , hamiltionian ( [ hamiiia ] ) , a possible model for describing the effect of asymmetric lateral strains in bilayer graphene , results in indirect band gaps for small strains ( @xmath265 ) . for larger strains ( @xmath266 )",
    ", overlapping indirect bands result in a gapless spectrum",
    ". no critical directional strain dependence is observed , which comes from the anisotropy of the 2d hexagonal lattice .",
    "applying strain to a graphene bilayer alters its electronic structure . using the simplest tight - binding model , featuring only nearest - neighbor intra- and inter - plane hopping ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 )",
    ", we have shown that for the ab ( bernal ) stacking of two graphene sheets , several band gap scenarios are possible .",
    "a first possibility is to push ( pull ) the bilayer s two graphene sheets towards ( away from ) each other . as a consequence of the different neighborhoods experienced by a and b carbon atoms ,",
    "the change in on - site tight - binding energies results in a symmetry breaking which , for large enough strains , opens a band gap .",
    "we find that pulling and pushing are inequivalent ; the former is more effective in producing a gap .",
    "predictions of the minimally required strain to open a band gap critically depend on values for the changes in on - site and inter - layer hopping energies with inter - plane distance ( @xmath232 and @xmath267 ) .",
    "these quantities are not readily available from the literature .",
    "we therefore rely on rules of thumb to make acceptable estimates , and find that for pulling , a band gap opens from @xmath268 onwards . for @xmath269 ,",
    "the band gap is about @xmath270 mev . for pushing ,",
    "the critical strain is well beyond @xmath271 .",
    "note that a strain of @xmath271 would require a pressure of @xmath272 gpa ( taking for the elastic constant @xmath273 the value of graphite , @xmath274 gpa @xcite ) , which is experimentally feasible .",
    "while bringing the two layers close together can be realized by applying high pressure , pulling the graphene sheets away from each other is an experimental challenge .",
    "a possible indirect way to do so would be to intercalate the bilayer ; recently , for example , li atoms have successfully been intercalated between two graphene sheets @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that at the critical strain , the electronic dispersion near the k - point consists of a triple degeneracy of two crossing linear bands ( dirac cone ) and one parabolic band .",
    "this result shows that under certain symmetry - breaking strain conditions , bilayer graphene can exhibit dirac fermions .",
    "normally , dirac fermions only occur in graphene multilayers consisting of an odd number of graphene sheets @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry of the hamiltonian matrix diagonal lies at the basis of the band structure modifications observed in fig .",
    "it was already recognized before @xcite that intra - layer on - site energy differences can lead to band gaps of a different type than the ",
    "mexican - hat - like \" band gap band structures @xcite associated with inter - layer energy differences e.g.  induced by the application of a bias . in the present work",
    ", we have shown that uniform perpendicular strain provides a physical means for enhancing the intra - layer energy differences .    a second possibility is to push / pull parallel to the bilayer ( symmetric uniform strain ) .",
    "it turns out that the criterion for opening a band gap is the same as for monolayer graphene ; the inter - plane coupling @xmath22 does not play any role .",
    "the conclusions made by pereira _",
    "@xcite for the monolayer can be transferred to the bilayer ; a strain along the zig - zag direction larger than @xmath275 results in a band gap , while pushing / pulling along the armchair direction never leads to a gap .",
    "finally , we considered asymmetric uniform strain : the two graphene sheets experience different strains parallel to the bilayer . assuming a tight - binding hamiltonian matrix where @xmath22 represents an average inter - plane hopping , we obtain the interesting result that a small finite strain , in any direction , immediately opens a band gap .",
    "the maximal band gap depends , similarly to the case of transversal strain , on the interplay of the quantities @xmath231 and @xmath224 , reliable estimates for which are hard to derive .",
    "the observed band gaps are relatively small  @xmath255 mev .",
    "the advantage , however , is that there is no strain barrier .",
    "rather , beyond a certain strain ( typically @xmath276 ) , bands start to indirectly overlap and destroy the gap .",
    "as opposed to the case of uniform symmetric strain , no dependence on the strain direction was obtained  a consequence of the isotropy of a hexagonal lattice and of taking the elastic response in the perpendicular direction into account . pushing and pulling are equivalent .",
    "we point out that the observed band gaps are indirect , which is relevant for possible opto - electronic applications .",
    "our results are in qualitative agreement with recent ab initio calculations of the electronic structure of similarly asymmetrically strained bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "although having provided estimates for strains @xmath208 required for the opening of a band gap and associated band gap magnitudes @xmath277 , we wish to emphasize the qualitative aspect of our results .",
    "irrespective of the precise values of the tight - binding parameters and derived quantities , it is the particular structure of the graphene bilayer that , when deformed , allows for gapped electronic structures . in our opinion",
    ", the various ways shown here in which a band gap can be induced in bilayer graphene by deformations should stimulate experimental investigations on the possibility of strain - engineering bilayer graphene s electronic properties .",
    "recalling graphene s high strength , this should be feasible .",
    "in addition , we suggest that the theoretical models presented here be reconsidered by means of precise ab initio calculations .",

    "@xmath283 must be small as well .",
