    "symmetrical morphologies and regular patterns in living organisms ( fig  [ fig1 ] ) have been credited with originating the idea of beauty , the notion of art as an imitation of nature , and humanity s first mathematical inquiries  @xcite .",
    "the fascinating symmetrical patterns of organs in plants , called phyllotaxis  @xcite , were known to the romans ( pliny ) and ancient greeks ( theofrastus ) , while early recognitions are found in sources as ancient as the text of the pyramids  @xcite .",
    "leonardo da vinci  @xcite , andrea cesalpino , and charles bonnet  @xcite studied phyllotaxis in the modern era .",
    "kepler proposed that the fibonacci sequence ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8  ) , where each term is the sum of the two preceeding ones  @xcite , describes these phyllotactic patterns .    a discipline that thrived on multidisciplinary interactions  @xcite , phyllotaxis found its standard mathematical description when august and louis bravais  @xcite introduced the point lattice on a cylinder to represent the dispositions of leaves in 1837 ( see fig .",
    "[ lattice ] ) , thirteen years _ before _ august s seminal work on crystallography  @xcite . unfortunately botanists neglected the work of the bravais brothers , and it was nt until church rediscovered it eighty years later that more progress was achieved in the field  @xcite .",
    "the geometrical description of cylindrical phyllotaxis relies , in the simplest case , on the phyllotactic lattice introduced by the bravais brothers  @xcite .",
    "it consists of a so - called generative spiral of divergence angle @xmath0 .",
    "we can visually decompose the resulting lattice in crossing spirals that join nearest neighbors , as in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] , which botanists call parastichies .",
    "it is a fundamental observation ( made first by kepler ) that the numbers @xmath1 , @xmath2 of crossing parastichies needed to cover the lattice are consecutive terms of the standard fibonacci sequence , or less frequently the variants obtained by changing the second term , also called lucas numbers : 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 11  and 1 , 4 , 5 , 9  often referred to as second and third phyllotaxis . from that",
    ", one can prove that the divergence angle of the generative spirals in plants assumes values close to  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes first , second or third phyllotaxis and @xmath5 is the golden ratio . for more than one generative spiral ( `` multijugate '' phyllotaxis ) ,",
    "parastichies share a common divisor @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the number of generative spirals  @xcite .",
    "not unlike domain boundaries in crystals , plants show kinks between domains , called transitions by botanists  @xcite . in the last 50 years",
    ", phyllotactic patterns have been seen or predicted outside of botany : polypeptide chains  @xcite , tubular packings of spheres  @xcite , convection cells  @xcite , layered superconductors  @xcite , self - assembled microstructures  @xcite , and cooled particle beams  @xcite . while it is still debated whether such systems might shed light on botanical phyllotaxis ,",
    "the occurrence of such mathematical regularities outside of botany is fascinating and leads to generalizations that  unlike quasistatic botany  allows for dynamics  @xcite .    in a groundbreaking work levitov",
    "recognized phyllotaxis in vortices of layered superconductors  @xcite .",
    "he next described how phyllotactic patterns represent states of minimal energy of a cylindrical lattice ( that is of a lattice with cylindrical boundary conditions ) of mutually repelling objects , the repulsion mimicking the interactions between spines , leaves , or seeds in plant morphology  @xcite . yet such a constraint to a lattice",
    "is absent both in botany and in the physical systems to which this energetic model might apply , such as adatoms or low - density electrons on nanotubes and ions or dipolar molecules in cylindrical traps .     and the axial separation @xmath8 between particles.,width=3 ]    following up on earlier work that focused on the dynamics of rotons and solitons in physical phyllotactic systems  @xcite , we provide here a detailed experimental and numerical demonstration that levitov s constraint is not necessary , and that the lowest energy states of repulsive particles in cylindrical geometries are indeed phyllotactic lattices .",
    "in addition , we describe the experimental and numerical generation of multijugate phyllotaxis , static kink - like domain boundaries between different phyllotactic lattices , and unusual disordered yet reflection - symmetric structures that may be a static relic of soliton propagation .",
    "we show that when a `` magnetic cactus '' of magnets ( spines ) equally spaced on co - axial bearings ( stem ) with south poles all pointing outward is annealed , it precisely reproduces botanical phyllotaxis .",
    "when studied numerically via a structural genetic algorithm , the fully unconstrained case reveals both multijugate and mono jugate phyllotaxis .",
    "in addition to our macro - scale implementation , such systems could also be created at the quantum level in nanotubes or cold atomic gases .    in section",
    "ii we describe the statics of repulsive particles in cylindrical geometries . in section",
    "iii we detail the experiment on the magnetic cactus . in section",
    "iv we discuss the more general case of multijugate phyllotaxis .",
    "in this section we will recall levitov s model  @xcite and some of our own findings  @xcite . following levitov ,",
    "let us assume that the lowest energy configuration for a set of particles with repulsive interactions , confined to a cylindrical shell of radius @xmath9 , is a helix with a fixed angular offset @xmath0 between consecutive particles and a uniform axial spacing @xmath8 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( this so far unproved ansatz will be investigated later both numerically and experimentally ) . for a generic pair - wise repulsive interaction @xmath10 between particles @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the energy of the helix is @xmath13 . since the lattice structure is defined by @xmath0 , we can write @xmath14 .    in fig",
    ".  [ spectra ] we plot @xmath15 for various values of the ratio @xmath16 : for specificity we employed a dipole dipole interaction @xmath17 , repulsive at the densities considered here .",
    "however , the following considerations only depend upon geometry and therefore apply to a vast range of reasonably behaved , long range repulsive interactions .",
    "when @xmath18 , the angle @xmath19 maximizes distance between neighboring particles and therefore @xmath20 has a minimum in @xmath21 .",
    "the angle between second nearest neighbors along the helix is @xmath22 , which means that they face each other . and",
    "thus , as the density increases , interaction between the facing second nearest neighbors becomes predominant , and @xmath19 is not a minimum for @xmath20 anymore .",
    "if whe shift the helical angle from @xmath21 , the repulsive interaction between second nearest neighbors is reduced , with minimal penalty from nearest neighbors . in terms of @xmath20 ,",
    "that means a local maximum @xmath23 .",
    "this argument can be iterated for every commensurate winding that allows particles separated by @xmath12 neighbors to face each other .",
    "as density increases further , the angles @xmath24 and @xmath25 also become unfavorable due to third - neighbor interactions .",
    "any commensurate spiral of divergence angle @xmath26 with @xmath27 relatively prime corresponds to a configuration where each particle faces each @xmath28 neighbor .",
    "for every @xmath12 there will be a value of @xmath16 low enough such that @xmath26 is a local maximum , which we call a peak of rank @xmath12 .    the proliferation of peaks for increasing linear density is shown in fig  [ spectra ] .",
    "we can see that at high density , peaks of equal rank are nearly degenerate ; that is natural , since their principal defining energetic contribution arises from particles facing each other at a distance @xmath29 .",
    "the minima also become more nearly degenerate as the density increases .",
    "that can be explained intuitively , since for angles incommensurate to @xmath21 each particle `` sees '' the others as incommensurately smeared around the cylinder , and is therefore embedded in a nearly uniform background charge from the other particles .",
    "the degenerate energy of the ground state can be well approximated by an uniform continuum distribution @xmath30 , whereas the energy of a peak of order @xmath12 will be @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the energy of two particles facing at a distance @xmath33 : for our dipole interaction @xmath34 .",
    "the first step to calculate the degeneracy of our system at a given density , is to find the corresponding maximum rank of the peaks .",
    "as all of the peaks of the same rank have the same energy , and appear in the spectrum together , we can focus on the emergence of @xmath35 . for @xmath36",
    ", this new peak will emerge when the distance between particles separated by a distance @xmath37 equals that of particles separated by @xmath38 .",
    "therefore one finds for the maximum rank @xmath39 which as expected only depends on purely geometrical parameters .",
    "a little more tricky is to compute the degeneracy , given @xmath40 .",
    "the set of all the peaks has the cardinality of the class of all the fractions @xmath41 , with @xmath42 coprime and @xmath43 .",
    "this can be considered as the disjointed union of other classes , called farey classes of order j , defined as follows : @xmath44 for @xmath45 coprime and @xmath46 , i.e. all fractions in lowest terms between 0 and 1 whose denominators do not exceed @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the union of all farey classes up to a certain order @xmath40 has the cardinality of the set of peaks for a spectrum of maximum rank @xmath40 .",
    "now , the cardinality of @xmath47 is know from number theory to be euler s totient function , @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the degeneracy @xmath49 of the energy minima for a system with a maximum peak rank @xmath40 is  @xcite @xmath50 which , from eq .",
    "[ j ] , scales as @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we recall  @xcite that the order @xmath52 , @xmath53 of the peaks bracketing a minimum relates to its structure in a straighforward way : the helix corresponds to a rhombic lattice where each particle has its nearest neighbors at axial displacements of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and second nearest neighbors at @xmath56 or @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "also , @xmath52 and @xmath53 give the number of crossing secondary spirals ( parastichies ) needed to cover the lattice by connecting nearest neighbors .     versus divergence angle for successively halving values of @xmath16 starting from @xmath58 ( using dipole dipole interaction , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the magnetic dipole ) .",
    "notice the proliferation of peaks as @xmath16 decreases .",
    "reproduced from @xcite.,width=3 ]    for completeness , let us now follow levitov  @xcite , and consider the adiabatic evolution of our system as the linear density is increased . as new sets of maxima and minima emerge , the true minimum goes through a series of quasi - bifurcations , the consequence of an elusive symmetry whose explanation goes beyond our scope .",
    "suffice it to say that the system evolves quasi - statically from one of these optimal @xmath0 to another as @xmath61 increases , asymptoting to the golden angle @xmath62 @xmath63 $ ] , ubiquitous in botany , as each minimum is bracketed by peaks whose ranks , because of the farey tree structure described above , are consecutive elements of the fibonacci sequence .",
    "occasional `` wrong turns '' at later stages , will not shift the convergence too far from the golden angle , yet the fibonacci structure would be lost .",
    "however if one or two consecutive wrong turns happen at the second or second and third bifurcations the system will converge to the alternative angles of second or third phyllotaxis , given by eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) .",
    "we have only surveyed so far spiraling lattices generated by a single helix .",
    "a straightforward generalization gives multijugate phyllotaxis , when two or more elements grow at the same axial coordinate  @xcite .",
    "this case , which levitov does not explore , can be easily mathematically reduced to monojugate case , by considering two or more replicas of the phyllotactic lattice as in fig .  [ lattice ] .",
    "in our experimental realization we restrict ourselves to the monojugate phyllotaxis , and explore multijugate only numerically .",
    "there is a long history of experimental reproductions of phyllotactic patterns . recently ,",
    "_ described phyllotaxis in terms of dynamical systems and then verified it experimentally by examining dynamical processes in droplets of ferro - fluid  @xcite . but even more than a century ago , airy showed that phyllotaxis emerged in optimal packing of hard spheres connected by a rubber band , once the band was twisted to increase density  @xcite .    here",
    "we expand on what was announced in a recently published letter  @xcite : we verify experimentally the assumptions of levitov s energetic model , by studying the low energy configurations of interacting magnets stacked evenly - spaced and free to rotate around a common axis .",
    "we constructed a mechanical system that it is free to explore the three angles of botanical phyllotaxis ( eq .  [ omega ] ) .",

    "our experimental apparatus is not fully unconstrained : the axial coordinates of the dipoles are fixed , and so only the azimuthal movement is allowed . while this is an huge improvement toward the original helical constraint of levitov , many ( most ) physical systems that could manifest phyllotactic patterns do not posses such a lesser azimuthal constraint . to corroborate and extend our experimental results to a completely unconstrained system , we seek the energy minimum in a set of repulsive particles that can move _ axially _ as well as _",
    "angularly _ on a cylindrical surface , via a non - local numerical optimization . to this purpose",

    "a genetic algorithm is a method of optimization that mimics evolution to find the absolute minimum in a function which shows a large number of metastable minima .",
    "the coordinates of the energy functions are called genes , and a set of genes is a particular specification of value for those variables .",
    "the routine typically starts with a set of `` parents '' , or specific points in the domain of the energy function . at each stage of the routine ,",
    "parents `` mate '' to produce children via exchange of genes : a subset of the coordinates of each of the two configurations are swapped , therefore generating new points in the energy domain , called children . each of those children is then locally relaxed to a minimum via a local search .",
    "the new population of parents and children undergoes genetic selection and only the fittest ( the lowest energy ones ) form a new population .",
    "there are many different implementations of this general idea : care is taken not to lose genetic diversity during selection , to avoid a population of almost identical replicas ; that is usually achieved with a more or less skilled genetic selection , which might retain less geneticaly fit individuals , and often by introducing mutations in the form of random alteration of the gene sequence , which would opefully prevent the routine from gettting stuck around a metastable region .",
    "choice of parameterization of the structures ( genes ) and mating ( crossover ) is crucial to the performance of the algorithm .",
    "about fifteen years ago , deaven and ho  @xcite introduced a so - called _ structural _ genetic algorithm , which proved particularly efficient in minimazing the energy of physical structures , as it allows for physical intuition in defining the genes and mating procedure . with it , they found the c@xmath79 fullerene structure as a ground state of 60 carbon atoms interacting with suitable atomic potentials  @xcite and solved the celebrated thomson problem of repulsive charges on a sphere  @xcite , a task quite similar to ours .          in our implementation",

    "the particles interact via a pair - wise inverse quadratic repulsion @xmath83 , where @xmath33 _ is the three dimensional distance between particles _ ; we introduce a confining potential in the form of an external axial square - well of width @xmath84 , which sets the length of the cylinder , and hence the density .",
    "the choice of the pairwise interaction is not fundamental , as long as it is long ranged , repulsive , and well behaved  @xcite ; our particular choice simply speeds up the computation .",
    "we generate the first population randomly . at each step ,",

    "we then prepare the new generation by selecting the lowest energy individuals in the population of parents and children , yet making sure that the energy difference between members does not fall below a certain threshold , to preserve genetic diversity : when new children can not produce a new population of 10 in accordance with the energy threshold , we introduce mutations by randomly altering a certain number of members .     repulsive particles [ @xmath83 ] constrained to a cylindrical surface of length @xmath84 and radius @xmath88 .",

    "as before , each ring is shifted consecutively by a divergence angle @xmath0 . the case @xmath95 is shown at the top of fig .  [ multi ] . the case @xmath96 is shown in our experimental arrangement of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    by decomposing the n - jugate cylindrical lattice into @xmath1 lateral replicas of single - spiral lattice , as in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] , the reader is easily convinced that multijugate phyllotaxis reduces to the previously described monojugate case .",
    "all the considerations above apply , provided that one now takes the periodicity to be @xmath94 , and the distance between rings to be @xmath97 ( with , as before , @xmath98 ) .",
    "it follows that a n - jugate configuration will have local maxima in @xmath99 , @xmath100 and , following the discussion of section ii , one finds that there will be other local maxima corresponding to angles @xmath101 when @xmath102 $ ] , and @xmath40 is the maximum rank given by eq .",
    "note now that if two multijugate lattices of jugation @xmath1 , @xmath103 have a peak in the commensurate angle @xmath104 , then the energy of the peak is the same , as is shown in fig .",

    "in fact both configurations correspond to particles facing each other after @xmath105 and @xmath106 rings , and therefore at the same distance @xmath107 , independent of @xmath1 or @xmath103 . for small @xmath1",
    "the minima in the energy of n - jugate configurations essentially degenerate with the monojugate one previously explored . for large @xmath1",
    "they have higher energy .",
    "if @xmath16 is small enough , the threshold is @xmath108 , as interaction between particles on the same ring become comparable to those facing in the minimal monojugate peak .",
    "we have studied the lowest energy configurations of repulsive particles on cylindrical surfaces , both experimentally and numerically .",
    "we have found that they correspond to the spiraling lattices seen in the phyllotaxis of living beings , both monojugate and multijugate . by establishing experimentally and numerically that phyllotactic point lattices",
    "are ground states in the very general geometric scenario of unconstrained repulsive particles on cylinders , we have opened the study of phyllotaxis to a much wider range of annealable physical systems where the particles could be electrons , adatoms , ions , dipolar molecules , nanoparticles , etc . constrained by external potentials .    unlike plants , these multifarious , non - biological phyllotactic systems could access various degrees of dynamics , providing new phenomenology well beyond that available to over - damped , adiabatic botany .",
