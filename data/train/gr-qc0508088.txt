    "spin foam models offer a promising new quantum mechanical picture of space - time geometry .",
    "the spin foam program has been developed as a path integral formulation of loop quantum gravity .",
    "of the spin foam models proposed in the literature , perhaps the most studied have been the barrett - crane models .",
    "originally constructed using representations of the group @xmath0 associated to manifolds of riemannian signature @xcite , a subsequent model given by barrett and crane in @xcite based upon representations of the lorentz group @xmath1 is considered to be more physically realistic .",
    "while important strides have been made in numerical computations within the riemannian framework @xcite , numerical computations with the lorentzian model have proven much more difficult .",
    "an important difference between the models lies in the space of representations , which in the lorentzian case is continuous rather than discrete .",
    "in addition , the homogeneous space used to define vertex amplitudes is non - compact in the lorentzian case .",
    "the main result of the present work is that the lorentzian partition function can , by a process we shall refer to as `` face factoring '' , be rearranged so that integration over the representation variables is performed exactly . after applying this transformation ,",
    "computational or analytic effort can focus entirely on the homogeneous space integrals and the one - dimensional integrals associated to each edge of the spin foam .",
    "we note that the model that results from face factoring is strongly in the spirit of the _ dual variables picture _ proposed by pfeiffer in @xcite .",
    "while @xcite dealt specifically with a riemannian version of the barrett - crane model , our face - factored model can be understood as the realization of a dual variables picture in the lorentzian case .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we recall the form of the lorentzian barrett - crane amplitude and describe the face factoring method . included in this section",
    "is an illustration of the method applied to the partition function of a simple 2-complex . in section 3",
    ", we prove that the partition function associated to triangulations of a certain type is absolutely convergent in the face factored formulation , which justifies the interchange of integration required by the method .",
    "it follows that the original partition function is finite for triangulations of this type , which includes both the non - degenerate triangulations proven finite in @xcite as well as certain degenerate triangulations that have not previously been proven finite .",
    "it should be noted here that in the present work and in @xcite , finiteness is shown for a specific choice of edge and face amplitudes ; throughout this work our main interest is in the choice due to perez and rovelli @xcite .",
    "we also show how the method can be applied to an explicitly causal version of the barrett - crane model due to livine and oriti @xcite for certain types of triangulations . in section 4",
    ", we briefly discuss the potential for numerical applications of the method and end with some concluding remarks . a bound required in section 3",
    "is proven in appendix a , and in appendix b we show that the finiteness results of section 3 ( in which a closed 4-manifold is assumed for clarity ) also hold in the case of a 4-manifold with boundary .",
    "to begin our discussion , we recall the form of a lorentzian spin foam model .",
    "spin foam models are defined on simplicial 2-complexes constructed from a set of vertices @xmath2 , a set of edges @xmath3 , and a set of polygonal faces @xmath4 . because our present work is with the barrett - crane model , we restrict ourselves to those 2-complexes which are the _ dual 2-skeleton _ of a 4-manifold triangulation .",
    "the dual 2-skeleton is formed as follows : for every 4-simplex there is an associated dual vertex , and any two dual vertices whose associated 4-simplices meet at a tetrahedron are connected by a dual edge . for every face of the triangulation , the closed loop of 4-simplices that share that face gives rise to a two - dimensional polygon in the dual 2-skeleton , the vertices of which are dual to the 4-simplices and the edges of which are dual to the tetrahedra that are shared between neighboring 4-simplices .",
    "an important property of this construction is that the dual polygonal faces are in one - to - one correspondence with the faces of the original 4-manifold triangulation .",
    "further background , including illustrations of dual skeleta , can be found in @xcite .",
    "we now introduce the lorentzian barrett - crane model , which assigns to each dual 2-complex @xmath5 a partition function @xmath6 as follows : @xmath7 where factors of the form @xmath8 arise from the measure on the principal series of @xmath1 representations ; the amplitudes @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 will be defined shortly . for a given 2-complex ,",
    "the state space associated with this partition function is the product space of representation variables @xmath12 ( one for each face ) and the multiple integration over this space is thought of as a path integration over all spin configurations . to find the transition amplitude between two spin networks ( the basis states of 3-geometry in loop quantum gravity ) , a sum of @xmath6 over all 2-complexes interpolating between the spin networks",
    "is required . in the sum over 2-complexes ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath6 for each 2-complex will be weighted by an appropriate measure to provide a normalization and possibly to regulate which 2-complexes can contribute .",
    "the choice of measure and questions of convergence have yet to be resolved  progress is likely to depend on what results can be found for the partition function of individual 2-complexes , which is the focus of our present work .    in the expressions to follow , we write @xmath13 to indicate a formal product of symbols such as integral signs or measures .",
    "when a relation such as @xmath14 appears below a product symbol ( multiplicative or formal ) , the product is taken over all of the objects on the left hand side of relation that satisfy the relation ; for example , in the @xmath14 case the product would be over all faces @xmath15 such that @xmath16 is a member of @xmath15 .",
    "the symbols @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath15 will always denote members of the sets @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we now turn to the definition of the amplitudes @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 that appear in ( 2.1 ) . up to a regularization that will be defined below",
    ", the lorentzian barrett - crane vertex amplitude of @xcite is defined as@xmath21 where the kernel function @xmath22 is @xmath23 the kernels @xmath22 are functions of the variables @xmath24 associated to the two dual edges that both contain @xmath16 and are contained in @xmath15 ; the + and @xmath25 serve to distinguish the two tetrahedra within a 4-simplex that share a face , but otherwise have no significance  any fixed convention can be chosen . as there are ten faces in the 4-simplex to which a vertex is dual , the integrand is a product of ten such kernels . the kernel function",
    "@xmath22 depends on the hyperboloid variables through their hyperbolic distance @xmath26 on @xmath27 , which is defined as@xmath28 for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 ; here @xmath31 is the minkowski inner product @xmath32 .",
    "although the expression for the vertex amplitude given above is generally infinite , we shall regularize it by fixing the value of one @xmath27 variable and dropping the corresponding integral over @xmath27  the answer is independent of the choices @xcite .",
    "it should be observed that the future 3-hyperboloid @xmath27 is a homogeneous space of @xmath33 and , unlike the homogeneous space @xmath34 that arises in the riemannian model , it is non - compact .",
    "the other basic difference with the riemannian model is that the relevant representations representations from the principal series . while some proposals @xcite have been made which also include half integer labelled representations @xmath35 , most work has been with the original proposal .",
    "] of @xmath33 are indexed by a continuous parameter @xmath12 ; in place of a summation for each face the lorentzian model requires an integral .    while the original model of @xcite specifies the vertex amplitude @xmath36 as given in ( 2.2 ) , it leaves unspecified the edge and face amplitudes @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "a proposal introduced by perez and rovelli in @xcite and considered in further work @xcite chooses factors from the measure into the definition of @xmath39 ; in the present work we keep the measure and face amplitude distinct . ] @xmath40 and @xmath41 for edges in the interior of the 2-complex .",
    "the function @xmath42 is known as the _ eye diagram _ and can be defined as follows : @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the spin variables labelling the four faces containing @xmath17 .",
    "the results we have obtained with the face factoring technique have primarily been for the amplitudes @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; we shall henceforth refer to this choice as the _ perez - rovelli _ _",
    "model_.      the major difficulty in computing @xmath6 as presented in ( 2.1 ) relates to the computation of the vertex amplitude ( 2.2 ) . for each choice of the ten @xmath12 variables , calculating a single vertex amplitude requires extensive computational effort in the form of monte carlo or quasi monte carlo integration . in the absence of an exact expression or some other significantly more efficient means of calculation , it is prohibitively expensive computationally to evaluate the partition function for even the simplest 2-complexes .",
    "this situation has provided the main motivation for finding an alternative approach to calculating @xmath6 , in which no vertex amplitudes are explicitly computed .",
    "the idea of the present work is to perform the integration over the spin variables @xmath12 first , leaving a formulation in which the states to be integrated over are the configurations of @xmath27 variables originating with the vertex amplitude integrand and the @xmath45 variables originating with the edge amplitude integrand .",
    "this reverses the conventional integration order implicit in ( 2.1 ) that has been adopted in most computational approaches to date .",
    "for example , in computations for the riemannian case @xcite the vertex amplitudes ( equal to integrals over the homogeneous space ) are computed for each spin configuration and the results summed to give the partition function .",
    "given the difficulty in evaluating a lorentzian vertex amplitude for a single choice of spins , it is a rather fortuitous result that all the spin dependence can be integrated out  indeed , as we shall see shortly , one obtains exact expressions in terms of the remaining @xmath27 and @xmath45 variables .",
    "we define the method explicitly as follows .",
    "assuming that the original partition function is not affected by interchanging the order of integration , we can write : @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49 on the rhs of ( 2.6 ) , all dependence on the @xmath12 variables is integrated out before performing the integrals over @xmath27 .",
    "as called for by the regularization , one integration with respect to @xmath27 has been dropped from each vertex ( the edge at @xmath16 for which integration is dropped is denoted by @xmath50 ) . to perform integration over the @xmath12 variables first",
    ", we consider the product of all the edge and vertex amplitude integrands , and organize this product into factors that each depend only upon a single @xmath12 variable .",
    "if we consider for the moment only the factors contributed by the vertex amplitudes @xmath36 given in ( 2.2 ) , we note the following . due to the form of the integrand of @xmath36 in terms of the functions ( 2.3 ) , we see that for any given face @xmath15 of the 2-complex all of the factors involving the spin @xmath12 can be grouped together into a _ vertex face factor _",
    "@xmath51 of the form@xmath52 where the @xmath53 denote distances on @xmath27 and @xmath54 denotes the number of vertices contained in the dual face @xmath15 . with regard to the subscript @xmath55 indexing the @xmath53 variables",
    ", we assume that a numbering of vertices in every dual face @xmath15 has been chosen ; the @xmath55 subscript runs over the values of the indexing map @xmath56 and the corresponding vertex @xmath16 is found by inverting @xmath56 .",
    "explicitly , we choose for each @xmath15 a bijective map of the form @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the set of vertices in @xmath15 .",
    "although we have suppressed the arguments of each @xmath53 in the formula above , for a given @xmath53 letting @xmath59 we see that @xmath60 is a function of the @xmath27 variables @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "although the face amplitude for the perez - rovelli model has no spin dependence ( @xmath63 , the edge amplitude ( 2.5 ) is a non - trivial function of the four spins variables associated to an edge of the 2-complex .",
    "while the eye diagram can be integrated to an exact expression in terms of the product of spin variables and the hyperbolic cotangent function @xcite , the result does not have a form in which the spins @xmath12 appear in separate factors .",
    "however , we observe from ( 2.5 ) that _ before _ integration with respect to @xmath45 , the @xmath12 dependent part of the integrand is a product of factors of the form @xmath64 .",
    "hence , if we collect factors from the different edge amplitude integrands that depend on the same @xmath12 , we have a product for each face which has the same form as the vertex face factor ( 2.7 ) , but with the @xmath45 variables playing the role of the hyperbolic distance variables @xmath53 . therefore ,",
    "if the @xmath45 variables are integrated only after integrating with respect to the @xmath12 , we can define an overall face factor that takes into account contributions from both edge and vertex amplitude kernels .",
    "our final form for the face factors are then@xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the number of edges contained in the face @xmath15 and the @xmath67 selects the @xmath55th edge , we assume that for every face a numbering of its edges @xmath68 has been chosen .",
    "we use an edge valued subscript for the @xmath45 as there is only one such variable for every edge . ]",
    "contained in the face @xmath15 .",
    "it should be noted that we have absorbed the @xmath8 terms from the measure into our definition of @xmath69 by lowering the power of @xmath12 in the denominator by two .",
    "having defined our face factors , we can now rewrite the partition function in terms of the integrals of the face factors @xmath70 and products of @xmath71 functions that depend only upon the @xmath45 and @xmath53 : @xmath72    @xmath73 formula ( 2.9 ) is our explicit _ face factored formulation _ for the partition function of the perez - rovelli model ; in section 3 we shall prove it is equal to the original model for all non - degenerate triangulations and certain degenerate triangulations .    from ( 2.9 ) , we see that face factoring requires interchanging the order of integration among the @xmath12 , the @xmath45 , and the hyperboloid integrals  all of which are improper . in order to justify the interchange",
    ", it is sufficient that at least one of the orderings of integration is absolutely integrable .",
    "this follows from the tonelli - hobson test , a corollary of the well - known fubini theorem in the case of integrals on an unbounded domain ; see for example @xcite . in section 3 below , we justify this interchange for a general class of triangulated 4-manifolds by establishing absolute integrability for the face factored formulation of the partition function .",
    "we consider next an illustration of the face - factoring method for the 2-complex dual to a particular triangulation of the 4-sphere @xmath74 .      for simplicity ,",
    "we consider in this section a modified perez - rovelli model with ( 2.5 ) replaced by a trivial edge amplitude so that@xmath75 the standard barrett - crane vertex amplitude@xmath76 is used ; recall from ( 2.3 ) that the kernel functions are@xmath23    consider the triangulation of @xmath74 resulting from taking the boundary of the 5-simplex . in this triangulation , there are 6 four - simplices , 15 tetrahedra , and 20 triangles .",
    "we shall work with the dual 2-skeleton of this triangulation , in which there are 6 vertices , 15 edges , and 20 polygonal faces ; the relevant face factors @xmath77 will be deduced from counting and symmetry arguments . because each vertex is contained in ten faces",
    ", there will be ten @xmath78 factors per vertex for a total of sixty @xmath78 factors . in our present case ,",
    "all faces have an associated face factor of the same form by symmetry .",
    "since by definition there is a face factor for each face @xmath15 and there are twenty faces for the entire 2-complex , we see that each face factor has the form @xmath79 where the three @xmath53 are associated to the three vertices in @xmath15 .",
    "having found the face factor , we consider the integral that appears in the face - factored form of the partition function definition given in ( 2.9):@xmath80    @xmath81 as suggested above , this integral is not difficult to evaluate to an exact closed form in terms of the distance variables @xmath53 .",
    "we note here that given the difficulty of evaluating a single lorentzian vertex amplitude , it may be surprising that integrating over all the spin variables can be done in such a way that the result is a product of simple functions of the @xmath27 variables .",
    "we again emphasize that to equate the face factored form of ( 2.9 ) with the original formulation of the partition function , interchanging the order of the improper integrals needs to be justified .",
    "we wo nt provide such a justification for this example case  however , in section 3 we prove that the face factoring method is valid for the actual case of interest , the lorentzian barrett - crane model with the perez - rovelli face and edge amplitudes . before doing so",
    ", we shall give an exact closed form expression for the face factor integrations that arise in the perez - rovelli model .",
    "in the perez - rovelli model , the most general face factor is given by ( 2.8 ) , and the integrals required to eliminate dependence on @xmath12 for a given @xmath15 are of the form@xmath82 clearly , this integral can be expressed using a product of @xmath83 functions as    @xmath84 were it not for the factor of @xmath8 due to the measure , one would be integrating a product of @xmath83 functions with arguments scaled by the @xmath53 and @xmath45 variables . if this were the case , a rather remarkable closed form given by borwein et .",
    "al . in @xcite could be directly applied .",
    "this formula , which will be useful for our actual case as well , we give here as follows .    without loss of generality ,",
    "let an arbitrary face @xmath15 in the 2-complex be chosen .",
    "we define a new set of variables @xmath85 so that @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 for @xmath89 . as the @xmath85",
    "are all non - negative , we can apply from @xcite the result:@xmath90    @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath94 and @xmath95 are defined by@xmath96 remarkably , it turns out that this formula enables us to handle the perez - rovelli case as well  we simply differentiate both sides of ( 2.12 ) twice with respect to ( any ) one of the @xmath85 parameters . on the lhs",
    "the differentiation is passed under the integral sign ; choosing @xmath97 as our parameter to differentiate we have : @xmath98    @xmath99 note that differentiating @xmath100 twice with respect to @xmath97 gives the desired factor of @xmath8 multiplying the negative of @xmath101 .",
    "thus ( 2.13 ) provides a closed form expression for all the face factor integrals that may appear in the perez - rovelli model . in practice",
    ", one can also evaluate these types of integrals using symbolic integration with software such as maple or mathematica .",
    "the finiteness of the lorentzian barrett - crane partition function with the perez - rovelli choice for face and edge amplitudes was an important finding established in @xcite for arbitrary _ non - degenerate _ 2-complexes . in this section",
    ", we prove that the partition function is absolutely integrable for a more general class of 2-complexes .",
    "this proof both justifies the interchange of improper integrals required by face factoring and at the same time proves finiteness of the model for all non - degenerate triangulations and a certain class of degenerate triangulations .",
    "we characterize this class of degenerate triangulations and show how it is sensitive to certain changes in the face amplitude .",
    "note that the proof we give in this section applies to _ closed _ two - complexes .",
    "the result also holds for 2-complexes with boundary ; we describe in appendix b how the proof of the closed case is changed to account for the presence of boundaries .",
    "we start by introducing an absolute bound on the perez - rovelli partition function in its face - factored form ( 2.9 ) above.@xmath102",
    "@xmath103 introducing the inequality ( a.5 ) proven in appendix a : @xmath104 hence , if the rhs of the bound@xmath102    @xmath105 is finite then our face factored form of the partition function ( and hence the original form ) is finite .    to integrate out the @xmath45 variables in our bound , for each @xmath17 we collect together all the @xmath45 dependence into a single term of the form@xmath106 where @xmath107 is the overall power of @xmath45 appearing in ( 3.3 ) due to contributions from the four faces that contain @xmath17 .",
    "we claim that for @xmath108 , quantities of this form are always finite . to see this we divide the integration as follows:@xmath109 consider the first term .",
    "although the integrand is unbounded at @xmath110 , @xmath111 as @xmath112 , so near zero the integrand behaves as @xmath113 , which is integrable for @xmath108 , but will otherwise diverge . because @xmath114 for @xmath115 , we can bound the second term as@xmath116 which is finite , as the polynomial @xmath117 is exponentially damped as @xmath118 .",
    "thus all factors involving @xmath45 can be integrated to give finite factors if for each edge @xmath17 the inequality @xmath108 holds .",
    "we will return below to a discussion of this @xmath108 condition and the constraints it places on which degenerate triangulations can be shown finite .",
    "next we need to check that integration over the hyperboloid variables always yields finite factors . upon integrating out the @xmath45",
    "as described , we have reduced the bound ( 3.3 ) to : @xmath119    @xmath120 where the @xmath45 integrations and all other constants have been absorbed into an overall constant @xmath121 .    from this expression",
    ", we see that to complete our proof we require @xmath122 for each @xmath16 to be finite . note that these integrals are of the same form of the vertex amplitude ( 2 ) , but with modified kernel functions . in recent work by dan christensen @xcite , a proof is given in which a class of integrals that includes those of the form ( 3.6 ) are shown to be finite . from this",
    "we can conclude that _ all hyperboloid integrations produce finite factors_.    therefore , absolute integrability for our bound on the face factored formulation depends only upon finiteness of the @xmath45 variable integrations , for which we found above that @xmath108 is a necessary and sufficient condition .",
    "we analyze the @xmath108 condition as follows . for all non - degenerate triangulations , @xmath123 ,",
    "hence the power of @xmath45 appearing in each face factor is at least @xmath124 . since each @xmath45",
    "is associated to a tetrahedron , it will appear in 4 face factors .",
    "hence @xmath125 , and so we conclude that _ all non - degenerate triangulations are absolutely integrable .",
    "_ this justifies the face factoring method for these triangulations and gives an alternative finiteness proof to that of @xcite .",
    "more generally , the condition on @xmath126 in terms of the vertex and edge degrees @xmath127 and @xmath66 can be given as @xmath128 .",
    "if we consider degenerate triangulations where @xmath129 and @xmath129 , this condition is equivalent to the following statement :    _ the perez - rovelli partition function @xmath6 is absolutely integrable if for every @xmath130 , _",
    "@xmath131 _ for at least one _ @xmath15 _ containing _ @xmath17 .",
    "this is a generalization of the finiteness proof of @xcite , which was limited to non - degenerate triangulations .",
    "we shall see next that some degenerate triangulations satisfy this condition and some do not .      in the case where a dual 2-complex contains a face @xmath15 where @xmath127 or @xmath66 is less than 3 , it is dual to a degenerate triangulation .",
    "such a `` triangulation '' is not strictly speaking a triangulation in the usual sense of a simplicial complex , as it contains 4-simplices whose intersection contains more than one tetrahedra . while visualizing 4-dimensional geometry",
    "is challenging , we can draw lower - dimensional analogs of degenerate triangulations ; two examples are shown in figure 3.1 .",
    "using theorem 3.1 , the 4-dimensional analog of figure 3.1(a ) can be shown finite .",
    "observe that although the interior degenerate edges ( indicated with thickened lines ) have a face where @xmath132 and @xmath133 , they also have 3 faces where @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and so applying our criterion above we see that _ @xmath6 _ is finite .",
    "the four dimensional analog of figure 3.1(b ) , in which two 4-simplices intersect along all five of their boundary tetrahedra , results in @xmath132 and @xmath133 for all faces inside the tetrahedron of the intersection ; for edges dual to these tetrahedra @xmath136",
    "so integration of our face factor bound in the @xmath45 variable diverges .",
    "hence our proof fails to show that such 2-complexes are finite .",
    "we remark here that our theorem 3.1 is a sufficient condition but we have not shown it to be necessary  our work does not rule out finiteness of the face factored form for this type of triangulation .",
    "however , even if the face factored form can be shown _ not _ to be absolutely integrable , the original form of the partition function may still be finite but only conditionally convergent . currently , numerical computations are underway by the author to explore some of these possibilities for 2-complexes arising from these degenerate triangulations .",
    "a final observation relates to how possible changes in the face amplitude affect the integrability of degenerate triangulations .",
    "while the edge and vertex amplitudes we have used here are fairly well accepted and can be given some physical motivation , it may be of interest to consider alternatives to the @xmath137 choice .",
    "if we allow ourselves to consider a face amplitude of the form@xmath138 for @xmath139 , we can construct a new bound ( following the steps of appendix a ) in which the convergence condition becomes @xmath140 .",
    "the analog of theorem 3.1 is than the requirement that@xmath141 for some @xmath15 containing @xmath17 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that for @xmath142 , this criterion is still met even if @xmath143 for _ all _ the faces of a tetrahedron , the case which fails for the original amplitude @xmath137 corresponding to @xmath144 .",
    "hence , with the original model such 2-complexes give a bound that is divergent but at the `` margin '' of integrability  any non - zero @xmath145 results in a model where all degenerate triangulations satisfying @xmath129 and @xmath129 are finite .",
    "in the livine - oriti causal model developed in @xcite , the kernel functions for the vertex amplitude @xmath36 are modified to take into account face orientations @xmath146 relative to a vertex @xmath16 that arise when imposing causality .",
    "the causal kernel replacing the original kernel ( 2.3 ) is given as@xmath147 from the form of this kernel , we can write the vertex face factors as@xmath148 the integral @xmath149 diverges in the general case , because the numerator approaches a constant as @xmath150 while the denominator approaches zero at least linearly ; this gives a divergent integral for @xmath151 , which applies to any triangulation .",
    "hence , contributions to the overall face factor from face and edge amplitudes must be relied upon to give a finite face factored partition function .      in @xcite ,",
    "the edge amplitude remains the eye diagram function when passing to the causal case .",
    "taking the causal vertex and edge amplitudes as fixed , we show in this section how the face amplitude has to be carefully tuned to avoid divergence of the face factored formulation .",
    "let us consider the full causal face factor with the edge amplitude kernels and a face amplitude of the form @xmath152 for a real number @xmath153:@xmath154 observing that the product of @xmath155 sine functions can cancel against the @xmath156 at @xmath157 , to avoid divergence we arrive at the condition@xmath158 in addition , if @xmath159 then @xmath70 for general @xmath26 fails to have a limit as @xmath160 , and so its integral is not defined .",
    "hence a necessary finiteness condition for a given @xmath153 is @xmath161    for @xmath162 as has been proposed , ( 4.4 ) becomes @xmath54@xmath163 and @xmath164 ; thus we see that the former condition restricts us to degenerate triangulations . for @xmath165",
    "however , degenerate triangulations are completely ruled out .",
    "note here that in ( 4.4 ) the parameter @xmath153 is bounded from both above and below .",
    "we stress here that failure of convergence for the face factored partition function does not imply divergence of the original form ; it may still be that the original partition function is conditionally integrable , precluding the identification of the two forms .    to summarize",
    ", we find that for the oriti - livine model there are some rather strong constraints on @xmath166 necessary for the existence of a finite face factored formulation .",
    "an interesting goal for future work is to determine whether the model with original integration ordering escapes these constraints by being conditionally convergent , or if it in fact is divergent in the same cases as are divergent in the face factored formulation .      within the context of monte carlo methods applied directly to the partition function , the face factored formulation is advantageous in several respects .",
    "the integrations eliminated involved a highly oscillatory product of sine functions ; the integration of these functions leads to much smoother functions of the remaining variables .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the remaining functions are always non - negative @xcite .",
    "the features of smoothing and positivity are both desirable in monte carlo methods for improving the accuracy achievable for a given number of samples .",
    "currently , computations are underway to evaluate the partition function for sufficiently small 2-complexes where the number of integration dimensions is still not prohibitive .",
    "apart from direct monte carlo methods which have severe scaling limitations , the face factored form of the partition function may be amenable to statistical mechanical methods similar to those used in lattice quantum field theory computations . in such computations , one avoids calculating the partition function itself , but rather generates a sequence of samples in configuration space which has the same distribution as that determined by the partition function . in this way , expectation values of observables",
    "can be found to good approximation without calculating the entire partition function .",
    "the metropolis algorithm is one such method that was successfully applied @xcite in calculating expectation values for the riemannian barrett - crane model .",
    "many statistical mechanical methods require that the partition function amplitude ; a function of @xmath12 variables in the original formulation and a function of @xmath27 and @xmath45 variables associated to tetrahedra in the face factored formulation . ]",
    "be non - negative for all configurations ( i.e. @xmath167the partition function amplitude is the exponential of some real - valued action ) . clearly , before face factoring the perez - rovelli amplitude as a function of all the spin variables fails to have such positivity due to its definition in terms of sine functions .",
    "however , after the @xmath12 variables have been integrated , it is rather remarkable that for closed spin foams the amplitude as a function of tetrahedral variables is always non - negative @xcite .",
    "the potential for applying lattice field theory techniques to spin foam models using `` dual '' tetrahedral variables has been emphasized by pfeiffer in @xcite , and may open the door to computing with much larger 2-complexes .    on a cautionary note ,",
    "the physical interpretation of a model defined purely in terms of tetrahedral variables seems ambiguous at this time . based upon connections to the regge action in certain limits and general geometric considerations ,",
    "it has been argued that the hyperboloid variables can be interpreted as the time - like normals to the tetrahedra ( which are purely spacelike by the barrett - crane construction ) .",
    "while this viewpoint is certainly promising , it is unclear to the author how these interpretations can be related back to the canonical approach .",
    "in this paper we have shown how the lorentzian barrett - crane spin foam model can be reformulated so that integration with respect to the spin variables @xmath12 is performed before all other integrations to yield exact expressions in terms of tetrahedral variables .",
    "absolute integrability was proven for the face factored formulation , justifying the interchange of integration and establishing finiteness for a large class of triangulations .",
    "this class includes all non - degenerate triangulations and a certain class of degenerate triangulations , extending the finiteness proof of @xcite .",
    "in addition to the face - factoring transformation , an essential ingredient of this proof is a recent finiteness result due to christensen @xcite for a large class of 10j - like integrals .",
    "we have also described how the type of degenerate triangulations proven finite by our method depends upon the choice of face amplitude .",
    "given this result , it may be worthwhile to investigate more thoroughly the physical significance of the degenerate triangulations .",
    "while the method can also be applied to the causal livine - oriti model , we found that given their choice of edge and vertex amplitude , there is a rather stringent constraint between the form of the face amplitude and the types of triangulations that allow a finite face factoring formulation .",
    "an interesting feature of the barrett - crane model revealed by our work is that edge and vertex amplitudes contribute kernels to the face factors of the same form ; this is no accident and can be traced back to the diagrammatics used to derive the model @xcite .",
    "hence , an obvious question is whether or not generalizations or modifications of the barrett - crane model may still allow a face factoring formulation .",
    "specifically , one could consider whether the barrett - crane type model proposed in @xcite , with mixed representations , may be susceptible to a face factoring treatment .",
    "moreover , it may be interesting to investigate whether any analog of face factoring is possible for spin foam models not of the barrett - crane type",

    "the author also acknowledges the financial support of nserc and ogs .",
    "in this appendix we find functions of @xmath45 and @xmath53 that bound from above the possible integrated face factors that arise in the perez - rovelli model .",
    "the bounding functions have the simple form of a product of @xmath45 and @xmath53 variables raised to a power that depends only upon the number of edges and vertices that the face contains .",
    "these bounding functions are used in section 3 to show the absolute integrability of the face - factored formulation .    to begin",
    ", we recall that the most general face factor that can arise for the perez - rovelli model has the form    @xmath168    where the @xmath45 and @xmath53 are non - negative real numbers coming from edge and vertex amplitudes , respectively . to see this , note simply that in both the edge and vertex amplitude each sine function in the numerator is accompanied by a factor of @xmath12 in the denominator .",
    "the measure then contributes a factor of @xmath8 , reducing the degree of the denominator by 2 .",
    "based on this form , we can immediately establish two types of bounds:@xmath169 and    @xmath170    @xmath171    the first inequality ( a.2 ) is valid for @xmath172 , while the second bound ( a.3 ) can only be used for @xmath173 . integrating both sides of these inequalities",
    "we can form the following estimate for the integrated face factor :    @xmath174    @xmath175 for any @xmath176 .",
    "since we are integrating @xmath12 for a given set of the @xmath53 and @xmath45 , we can make this @xmath177 a function @xmath178 of these variables .",
    "we make the following choice :    @xmath179 which upon substituting into ( a.4 ) gives :    @xmath180    @xmath181    @xmath182 although we assume @xmath176 for this derivation to be valid , if any of the @xmath53 or @xmath45 are zero than the original integrand ( a.1 ) and hence the integral over @xmath12 vanishes ; hence the bound ( a.5 ) is valid for any choice of @xmath53 and @xmath45 . as it relates to the discussion at the end of section 3 , we mention here that for a face amplitude of the form @xmath183 the above proof can be generalized to arrive at a bound :    @xmath184 by following essentially the same steps .",
    "as a path integral theory of quantum gravity , a spin foam model defines a transition amplitude from one 3-geometry to another for a given `` history ''  a triangulated 4-manifold whose boundary is the union of the ingoing and outgoing 3-geometries .    in the case where the 2-complex is dual to a triangulated 4-manifold with boundary , a straightforward extension of our finiteness proof for the closed case can be given .",
    "the spin variables associated to each face in the boundary are taken as boundary data , so these are not integrated in defining the partition function . as well , for dual edges and faces coming from boundary tetrahedra and triangles , one needs to take the square root of the edge and face amplitudes so that the partition function multiplies when two histories are `` glued '' along a common boundary .",
    "we shall denote the sets of edges and faces dual to the boundary tetrahedra and triangles as @xmath185 and @xmath186 , respectively . rather than working directly with the square root of the edge amplitude @xmath187 , in this proof we use the following bound:@xmath188 applying this bound to the partition function of a 2-complex @xmath5 with boundary we have@xmath189    @xmath190 considering the rhs of ( b.2 )",
    ", we see that expanding the product of @xmath191 functions results in a sum of partition functions in which boundary tetrahedra are either trivial ( @xmath192 or have the eye diagram amplitude @xmath193 .",
    "we will show that any partition function of this form is finite .",
    "first we handle the integrals with respect to the edge variables @xmath45 . for",
    "the given 2-complex @xmath5 , let a partition function be chosen where the amplitude for any boundary edge is either @xmath194 or @xmath193 , and all other amplitudes agree with the perez - rovelli model .",
    "we can extend the face factoring method to a partition functions of this form as follows .",
    "we begin by defining a boundary face factor @xmath195 associated to any face on the boundary as:@xmath196 where the function @xmath197 counts the boundary edges of type @xmath198 contained in @xmath15 .",
    "observe that since the @xmath12 are fixed on the boundary rather than integrated over , the measure factor of @xmath8 does not enter into the definition of @xmath199 ; the functions @xmath199 and not their integrals with respect to @xmath12 multiply into the partition function directly .",
    "the analog of the inequality ( a.2 ) for faces in the boundary can be given as @xmath200 in the open spin foam case , the inequality ( 3.2 ) is modified to include the boundary face factors:@xmath201    @xmath202 for tetrahedra in the interior , finiteness goes through as in the closed case .",
    "for tetrahedra on the boundary , there is an integration over @xmath45 for any edge @xmath17 of type @xmath198 ; for such edges one collects all the @xmath45 dependence to give factors of the form:@xmath203 as this integral is clearly finite , integrating with respect to the @xmath45 for all @xmath17 in the interior and boundary always yields finite factors . for boundary tetrahedra",
    "where @xmath194 , there is no @xmath45 variable to be integrated so finiteness of the bound is not affected .",
    "the final step is to show that the result of integrating the partition function bound over the hyperboloid variables is always finite . for a 4-simplex which has all of its faces on the interior",
    ", we recall from the proof of the closed case that integration with respect to hyperboloid variables factors into products of the form@xmath204 each of which can shown finite by invoking the result of @xcite . for 4-simplices that have one or more faces in the boundary , one instead has@xmath205 which",
    "again are shown to be finite in @xcite  thus we have checked all hyperboloid integrations lead to finite factors .",
    "as our bound ( b.2 ) is a finite sum of partition functions which are finite , we conclude that the perez - rovelli lorentzian partition function is finite for all 2-complexes dual to triangulated 4-manifolds with boundary , on the condition that the interior faces meet the same criteria with respect to @xmath127 and @xmath66 as were found for the closed case .",
