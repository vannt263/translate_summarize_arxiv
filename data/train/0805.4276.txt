    "for the past two decades , extensive studies of high-@xmath0 cuprates have spotlighted many curious phenomena .",
    "it has been argued that most phenomena are attributable to the strong correlations among electrons , which play significant roles in these materials .",
    "however , since the discovery of sudden changes in the electron dispersion or `` kinks '' shown by the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) ,  @xcite effects of electron - boson interactions on electronic self - energies have been recognized .",
    "while the kinks are now indisputable in cuprates ,  @xcite their origin as arising from electronic coupling to phonons  @xcite or magnetic excitations  @xcite remains unclear .",
    "recent scanning tunneling microscope study showed that the statistical distribution of energy of bosonic modes ( @xmath1 ) has meaningful difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 materials .",
    "thus , it should be hard to exclude the possibility that electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) significantly affects the electronic states in cuprates .    in this study , we investigate the analysis upon the epi together with the electron - electron interaction ( eei ) on the basis of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) three - band hubbard ",
    "holstein ( hh ) model . with the use of our three - band hh model",
    ", we can reproduce the situation of the real high-@xmath0 materials , in which epi mainly works on @xmath4 electrons at o sites .",
    "our model hamiltonian @xmath5 is composed of @xmath6 electrons at each cu site , @xmath4 electrons at o site , and lattice vibrations of o atoms .",
    "we consider only the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath7 between @xmath6 electrons at each cu site as our eei .",
    "let us define that @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the chemical potential and the number of all electrons , respectively .",
    "then , @xmath10 is divided into the non - interacting part , @xmath11 , the electron - electron interacting part @xmath12 , the phonon part @xmath13 , and the electron - phonon interacting part @xmath14 as @xmath15 here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the annihilation ( creation ) operator for @xmath6 and @xmath18 electrons of momentum @xmath19 and spin @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the non - interacting part @xmath11 is represented by @xmath21 we take the lattice constant of the square lattice formed from cu sites as the unit of length . then , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the transfer energy between a @xmath6 orbital and a neighboring @xmath18 orbital and @xmath25 is that between a @xmath26 orbital and a @xmath27 orbital .",
    "@xmath28 is the difference of energy levels of @xmath6 and @xmath4 orbitals . in this study , we take @xmath24 as the unit of energy .",
    "the residual parts are described as follows : @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath7 is the on - site coulomb repulsion between @xmath6 orbitals , @xmath32 is the number of @xmath19-space lattice points in the first brillouin zone ( fbz ) , and @xmath33 is the electron - phonon matrix element , respectively .",
    "we consider that the half - breathing phonon mode ,  @xcite in which oxygen ions are vibrating along the @xmath34 or @xmath35 directions , is crucial for our problem .",
    "thus , ignoring the other phonon modes , we have the electron - phonon interacting part as eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "then , we introduced the unperturbed and perturbed green s functions , which are to be described in @xmath36 matrix form .",
    "the unperturbed green s function @xmath37 is derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) as @xmath38^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a @xmath36 unit matrix . using the abbreviation of fermion matsubara frequencies , @xmath40 with integer @xmath41 and temperature @xmath42 ,",
    "the perturbed green function @xmath43 is determined by the dyson equation : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the self - energy expected to be a diagonal matrix . in order to estimate the @xmath6 electron self - energy @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , we adopt the fluctuation exchange approximation  @xcite as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 with integer @xmath51 are boson matsubara frequencies , and @xmath52 in order to estimate the p@xmath53-electron self - energy @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , we exploit the brillouin - wigner perturbation theory .",
    "we adopt the self - consistent one - loop approximation as follows : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the epi on p@xmath53 electron .",
    "our epi is determined as follows : @xmath58 , \\label{eq:9}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 is the specific phonon energy for the half - breathing mode .",
    "as above , we ignore the effects in which eei and epi are coupled .",
    "thus , as shown by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2])-([eq:9 ] ) , in our formulation , eei and epi are completely decoupled .",
    "of course , this assumption is inadequate to analyze the case in which the characteristic energy due to eei is comparable to the phonon energy .",
    "however , as will be seen later , we actually treat the cases with rather high characteristic energy due to eei .",
    "hence , decoupling eei with epi should be justified in our analysis .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath62 does not depend on @xmath63 since @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath63 is the mass of an oxygen ion . in our model , thus , the isotope effect is reflected on the phonon energy in the electronic self - energies only , but not any changes in the strength .",
    "we need to solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) in a fully self - consistent manner . during numerical calculations ,",
    "we divide the fbz into @xmath66 meshes .",
    "we prepare @xmath67 matsubara frequencies for temperature @xmath68 .",
    "as shown later , at this temperature , our calculation can reproduce the important behavior of electrons in normal state .",
    "moreover , to our knowledge , the situation will not be changed if we change @xmath42 to some extent .",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 , which are all common for our calculations .",

    "( [ eq:4 ] ) , the pad@xmath96 approximation is exploited for analytic continuation . furthermore , we calculate the electronic dispersions of the antibonding band @xmath97 along the nodal direction indicated as the cut in fig .",
    "[ figure:1 ] for all our doping cases .",
    "@xmath97 is determined as the @xmath98 point on which @xmath99 has the maximum value at each energy level .",
    "due to this method , the curves of @xmath97 look like a series of line segments , as shown in fig .  [ figure:2 ] .",
    "we compare every @xmath97 of our solution with the one obtained by another fully self - consistent manner , in which the same calculation is performed , except for the epi .",
    "we show our results on these dispersions in fig .",
    "[ figure:2 ] , where we can easily recognize that the dispersion kinks along the nodal direction appear only when epi affects the @xmath18 electrons .",
    "the kink energies were slightly shifted by @xmath100 substitution . in fig .",
    "[ figure:3 ] , we detail how these kink energies shift depending on hole doping .",
    "these theoretically evaluated isotope shifts are at most @xmath101 , which are much smaller than the ones measured by another group s arpes experiment .",
    "@xcite furthermore , these isotope shifts are almost independent of hole doping while another group insists that they are critically affected .",
    "@xcite considering the energy and momentum resolutions in their experiment , it may be hard to detect the subtle isotope shifts and their dependence on hole doping shown in our model .",
    "let us now look at @xmath62 and @xmath28 dependences in the dispersion kinks along the nodal direction in detail .",
    "figure  [ figure:4 ] shows the energy dispersions for @xmath75 ( dotted lines ) and @xmath79 ( solid lines ) . there is no clear difference in the isotope effect between @xmath79 ( @xmath102 ) and @xmath75 ( @xmath103 ) , though the dispersion kinks for @xmath79 are distinctly shifted to the high binding energy compared with those for @xmath75 .",
    "on the other hand , the isotope shift for @xmath81 ( @xmath104 ) is slightly shrank compared to that for @xmath105 ( @xmath102 ) , though the dispersions depend on the @xmath28 considerably , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure:5 ] .",
    "hence , our model calculation shows that the isotope shifts are not sensitive to @xmath62 and @xmath28 .",
    "considering that @xmath28 is closely related with eei in our three band hh model as discussed later , we can be fairly certain that the isotope shifts are determined by the relative strength between epi and eei .",
    "however , these changes of the isotope shifts are minute , thus , our discussions so far are valid regardless of @xmath62 and @xmath28 .    to clarify the epi effect on the @xmath18 electrons described above , we investigate the @xmath4 electron self - energy @xmath106 along the nodal direction .",
    "in fig .  [ figure:6 ] , we show @xmath83 on every six @xmath98 points along the nodal direction , located inside fermi surfaces .",
    "the energy where @xmath83 is maximal corresponds to the one of the dispersion kink and shifts upward by @xmath100 substitution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure:2 ] .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath83 is definitely due to the epi introduced with the use of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq:3 ] ) , and ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "thus , we can conclude that in our solutions for all doping levels from the ud to the od region , the dispersion kinks along the nodal direction are created _ only when the epi is included_.    hereafter , we will discuss why the magnetic ingredients hardly bring the dispersion kinks along the nodal direction .",
    "even when epi does not exist , the electrons in our results are exposed to the strong af fluctuation originating from the electronic correlation among @xmath6 electrons . in fig .",
    "[ figure:7 ] , we show @xmath89 on the same six @xmath98 points as in fig .  [ figure:6 ] .",
    "it is shown that there is no clear difference in @xmath89 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 materials .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath89 is definitely due to the electronic correlation introduced with the use of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2])([eq:7 ] ) .",
    "we easily recognize that @xmath89 uniformly increases with the binding energy and has no maximal value up to @xmath107 even for ld case , in which the strong af fluctuation is expected to be grown .",
    "thus , along the nodal direction , the strong af fluctuation could cause the renormalization of the fermi velocity , however , it hardly promotes any anomalous behavior such as kink structure .    finally , we will discuss how our eei affects the dispersion for @xmath2 materials . when the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath7 is changed , the fermi velocity is renormalized differently , but this would not change the kink energy so much since the kink energy is determined by the epi alone .",
    "[ figure:8 ] , we lay out our results for three different @xmath7s and they all correspond to op .",
    "their total doped holes @xmath108 are slightly different as : @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath111 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "hence , the fermi momentum for @xmath112 moves inside ( or the fermi surface shrinks ) and the one for @xmath113 moves outside ( or the fermi surface enlarges ) , compared to the one for @xmath93 .",
    "these changes of the fermi momenta are small ; however , the dispersions at higher energy are quite affected , reflecting the binding energy dependence of @xmath89 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure:7 ] .",
    "therefore , the dispersion at higher energy could be changed a lot by the eei even if the fermi velocities are almost independent of them .",
    "by the analysis of our model , we can show that the dispersion kink along the nodal direction occurs due to epi .",
    "the isotope effect upon the electronic dispersion is shown near the kink of energy dispersion , not in the high binding energy portions .",
    "@xcite our evaluation of the subtle isotope shifts has been backed by the report of the recent arpes experiments  @xcite which show the lack of the unusual isotope effect in the high energy portion .",
    "@xcite fortunately for us , our scenario was possibly realized in further arpes experiment .",
    "@xcite in addition to that , we have investigated how eei effects on the nodal dispersion .",
    "it can hardly affect the kink and the nodal fermi velocity ; however , it can change the dispersion at higher energy .",
    "hence , epi and eei play different roles on the nodal energy dispersion , respectively .    of course",
    ", our treatment of eei is just suited for _ weak coupling regime _ , and all of our parameter sets employed might be far from the ones for _ strong coupling regime_. if we investigate _ strong coupling regime _ with the use of another approach , the low energy structure corresponding to the superexchange @xmath114 could appear in the dispersion .",
    "however , our results presented here suggest that the structure should appear as a broad peak at higher energy due to the frequency dependence of the strong af fluctuation , which will grow into @xmath114 . as we all know",
    ", other works have already derive qualitatively similar conclusions on the basis of other models .",
    "some groups adopt @xmath115-@xmath114 models  @xcite and other groups do one - band hh models .",
    "@xcite furthermore , other groups have succeeded in explaining the arpes results .",
    "@xcite however , in our 2d three - band hh model , both the electron - electron interaction among the @xmath6 electrons and the epi on @xmath4 electrons are considered according to high-@xmath0 materials .",
    "we believe that it is important that quantitatively consistent results with the arpes experiments can be reproduced from such a model .",
    "the advantage will be when our analysis extends to the superconducting state , in which the @xmath4 electrons play important roles as well as @xmath6 electrons .",
