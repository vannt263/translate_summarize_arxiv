    "many workers argue that a thermodynamic anomaly underlies the onset of glassy dynamics  @xcite .",
    "evidence for this view is the rough , though not quantitative  @xcite , correlation between dynamic fragility and excess heat capacity discontinuity  @xcite .",
    "this thermodynamic view contrasts with the picture we have advocated  @xcite , attributing glassy behavior to dynamic heterogeneity  @xcite , with growing length scales appearing in space - time , but not space alone  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "direct observations of diffusive motion in colloidal glasses reveal excitations that are local and sparse  @xcite .",
    "these findings seem consistent with excitations being local and uncorrelated , as assumed in the two - state model for the low temperature behavior of structural glass heat capacities  @xcite .",
    "spatial correlations under such conditions can arise through constraints on particle motions that are relieved only when adjacent regions have exhibited some degree of mobility  @xcite .",
    "trajectories are then correlated throughout space and time , with varying degrees of hierarchical structure determining the extent to which the system is fragile or strong  @xcite . from this perspective",
    ", a non - thermodynamic explanation emerges for correlation between heat capacity and fragility  @xcite : the concentration of excitations required to support fragile hierarchical dynamics is higher than that required for strong non - hierarchical dynamics .",
    "the juxtaposition of heat capacity discontinuities is therefore understood as a consequence of different excitation concentrations .",
    "biroli , bouchaud and tarjus ( bb&t )  @xcite have taken issue with this explanation .",
    "they show that the simplest treatment of defect models can not simultaneously fit the size and temperature dependence of the experimental heat capacity while simultaneously fitting dynamic properties . in general and in more current context ,",
    "however , the terminology `` defect models '' refers to a broad class of kinetically constrained models  @xcite . as a result of this generality ,",
    "their question `` are defect models consistent with the entropy and specific heat of glass - formers ? '' has a non - trivial answer ( see also the analysis in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , this class of models has an assortment of possible dynamical behaviors , so that relaxation data can be fit with many different functions of excitation concentration .",
    "in addition , kinetically constrained models are coarse grained caricatures of fluids , so that many degrees of freedom remain unspecified . here , we focus on this latter feature , the possible consequences of unspecified degrees of freedom .    the starting point is the assumption that small length - scale and small time - scale features of a fluid can be integrated out leaving only simple stochastic rules for the dynamics of discrete variables on a lattice .",
    "these rules contain constraints imagined to be the consequence of the actual intermolecular interactions , interactions that limit the space or metric for molecular motions  @xcite .",
    "the excitations or defects that survive coarse graining distinguish microscopic regions of space - time that exhibit molecular mobility from those where molecules are jammed or immobile . in particular ,",
    "an excitation or defect is a microscopic region of space for which particle mobility emerges .",
    "this characterization is related to coarse graining in time , because it takes time to discern whether or not mobility is exhibited .",
    "bear in mind , `` defect '' does not distinguish disordered arrangements of atoms from those that are ordered because there are generally many disordered yet jammed configurations .",
    "similarly , a lack of `` excitation '' does not necessarily imply low energy because some immobile regions may have the same energy as mobile regions . uncertainty concerning this terminology may be the origin of criticisms of facilitated models leveled by bb&t  @xcite and also by lubchenko and wolynes  @xcite .    as a simple illustration ,",
    "consider dividing space into cells , with grid spacing larger than the equilibrium correlation length of the material . at a given time frame ,",
    "the micro states of different cells are then uncorrelated .",
    "further , suppose there are two energy levels , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for the states of a given cell , where the states with energy @xmath1 include those that will exhibit particle mobility after a coarse graining time @xmath2 .",
    "there is a fraction , @xmath3 , of states with energy @xmath1 that exhibit mobility in this way ; the others remain jammed . in this case",
    "the average excitation concentration is @xmath3 times the concentration of cells with energy @xmath1 , and thus the number of molecules contributing to energy or enthalpy fluctuations is @xmath4 times larger than that contributing to mobility fluctuations . in other words ,",
    "when considering the thermodynamic implications of a kinetically constrained defect model , a factor @xmath4 is required to account for energetic states or degrees of freedom absent from explicit consideration .",
    "bb&t ignore this factor , which leads them to the difficulties they describe .",
    "in the next section we discuss this point in greater detail .",
    "we show that facilitated or kinetically constrained models such as the one we presented in ref .",
    "@xcite admit a variety of possibilities for partitioning micro states .",
    "this demonstration justifies the heat capacity formulas we used in ref .",
    "@xcite and therefore supports our argument about the juxtaposition of heat capacities for strong and fragile glass formers .",
    "the dynamics of facilitated models we consider are governed by master equations for distribution functions of the mobility field on a lattice .",
    "consistent with our earlier papers , we use the symbol @xmath5 to denote the value of the mobility field at lattice site @xmath6 during time period @xmath7 .",
    "it is a binary field in that @xmath8 takes on one of two values , @xmath0 ( corresponding to a cell that is unexcited , jammed ) or @xmath9 ( corresponding to excited , mobile ) .",
    "each cell is imagined to contain several molecules , so we expect that even after some coarse graining , there are still many ( not just two ) microstates possible for each cell at a given time @xmath7 .",
    "we further imagine these many microstates , specified with @xmath10 , evolve according to their own master equation .",
    "the master equation for the distribution of the mobility field @xmath11 is a contraction of that for the micro - state field @xmath10 . in this section ,",
    "we show how this contraction works .",
    "we begin by considering the thermodynamics and statistics of the fields @xmath11 and @xmath10 , and then consider the master equations for the distributions of these fields .",
    "imagine we partition the liquid into a lattice with grid spacing @xmath12 , and denote the state in cell @xmath6 by @xmath10 .",
    "imagine further that the set of available cell levels @xmath13 can be split into two groups : one subset of @xmath13 is `` unexcited '' with respect to mobility , @xmath14 , and the complementary subset is `` excited '' , @xmath15 . in practice ,",
    "@xmath11 is most conveniently determined by observing system for a coarse graining time @xmath2 .",
    "this splitting , or projection , of many micro states into two different mobility states ( or several , as in the generalization of @xcite ) is the the first central assumption of facilitated models @xcite .    while the state @xmath16 of a cell will correspond to one of the two mobility states , @xmath17 , in general its energy , @xmath18 ,",
    "will be distributed .",
    "( for notational simplicity , when clarity is not diminished , we drop the subscripts on @xmath8 and @xmath19 . )",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent the normalized probability densities for the energy levels in states @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the cell partition function then reads ( we set @xmath24 ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 gives the total number of levels in each of the two mobility states .",
    "the excitation concentration is given by : @xmath28 the average energy per cell is : @xmath29 where @xmath30 the specific heat per cell is : @xmath31 where @xmath32    the quantity @xmath33 determines the concentration @xmath34 of excitations ; @xmath35 gives the average cell energy ; and @xmath36 sets the specific heat at small @xmath34 .",
    "except in the case where @xmath37 are delta functions , these scales are in principle all different .",
    "as a simple example , which will be useful below , consider the following model with just two energy levels .",
    "the unexcited states @xmath22 occupy both energy levels , which we denote @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with energies @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively : @xmath42 where @xmath43 sets the relative degeneracy between the two levels .",
    "the excited states @xmath23 have a single energy level , which we denote @xmath44 , with energy @xmath45 : @xmath46 in this case , the cell partition function , average energy and specific heat become : @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the relative occupation of the states @xmath39 with respect to states @xmath38 , @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "the total concentration of levels with energy @xmath1 is @xmath50 where we have defined @xmath3 as the ratio of mobile cells to the total number of cells with energy @xmath1 .",
    "the specific heat then reads @xmath51      we now show how an appropriate projection of the dynamics of the full states @xmath19 of individual cells into their mobility states @xmath52 gives a two - state facilitated model such as the fa or east models , and the slightly more general class of models introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "the approach we take has been used to derive approximate real - space renormalization group equations  @xcite . here",
    ", however , the approach requires no approximation .",
    "the master equation for the dynamics can be written @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the state vector for the probability density of the system at time @xmath7 , and @xmath55 is the liouvillian operator for the dynamics . in the direct product representation",
    "it reads @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the state vector for level @xmath19 in site @xmath6 .",
    "the second assumption in facilitated models is that transitions in a cell @xmath6 are only possible if neighbouring cells @xmath58 are mobile , @xmath59 @xcite . in a system with facilitated dynamics",
    "@xmath55 reads @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the kinetic constraint operator imposing facilitation , and @xmath62 is the unconstrained dynamic operator at site @xmath6 .",
    "for example , in the east facilitated model @xmath63 , and in the direct product representation : @xmath64 the off diagonal elements of @xmath62 are given by the transition rates between levels : @xmath65 , while the diagonal elements are such that the sum of columns in @xmath62 vanish .",
    "a choice satisfying detailed balance is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the equilibrium distribution .",
    "notice that we have assumed that transitions between any of the levels in the cell are only possible if facilitated by a neighbour .    in order to project the dynamics of the full set of levels @xmath68 into that of only the excitation occupancies",
    "@xmath69 we need projection , @xmath70 , and embedding , @xmath71 , operators @xcite : @xmath72 where the @xmath73 and @xmath74 s are constants .",
    "the projection is performed independently in each cell , so these are site diagonal operators .",
    "they must also satisfy @xmath75 .",
    "the dynamics of the projected state @xmath76 is then given by the projected liouvillian @xmath77 where the elements of the projection and embedding matrices ( [ t1t2 ] ) are given by : @xmath78 the choice of rates in @xmath55 , which depend only on the final level , @xmath79 , ensures that the projected dynamics is markovian @xcite .",
    "we now show explicitly how the projection procedure works in the simple the three - level example of the previous subsection . in this case @xmath80 , and the onsite operators can be represented by @xmath81 matrices : @xmath82    of the three levels @xmath68 , only @xmath83 corresponds to the excited state , and the projection matrix is : @xmath84 the corresponding embedding matrix is : @xmath85 the projected operators then read : @xmath86 these are precisely the operators for a two state facilitated model @xcite .     using the facilitated models of ref .",
