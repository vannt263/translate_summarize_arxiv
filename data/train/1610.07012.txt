    "where the proton ( or generally nucleon ) mass comes from remains , even after the discovery of higgs boson , as one of the great mysteries of nature . in this note",
    "i explore the possibility that the answer could perhaps be found in nuclear physics .",
    "given that the mass of the proton is very accurately measured , @xmath3 mev , more than 99.9% of the  visible \" mass around us  all the way down to atoms  can be accounted for in great accuracy by adding the number of nucleons involved in the system .",
    "even that of the nucleus which is in the core of atoms is accounted for up to 98% .",
    "the strong interactions taking place inside the nucleus are now quantitatively described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "so the mass of a nucleus is nearly completely given by the sum of the mass of the nucleons in the nucleus with only a small correction of binding energy , less than 1% of the proton mass , and even that small value can be fairly well explained , though in a highly intricate way , by qcd .",
    "this additive accountability , however , ends abruptly  and singularly  at this point .",
    "the proton mass , the source for the nuclear mass , is no longer accounted for as a sum of  something . \" in qcd , the relevant constituents are quarks , and for the nucleon the ( current ) quarks involved ,  up \" and  down , \" are very light , less than 5 mev .",
    "thus how the proton mass arises from its constituents must be drastically different from how the mass of a nucleus comes about .",
    "effectively , qcd for the proton is a theory for  mass without masses\"@xcite .    for most of particle physicists ,",
    "however , the proton mass is satisfactorily  explained .",
    "\" hence the end of the story ? in wilczek s words@xcite ,  here there are no uncontrolled approximations , no perturbative theory , no cutoff , and no room for fudge factors . a handful of parameters , inserted into a highly constrained theory of extraordinary symmetry , either will or wo nt account for the incredible wealth of measured phenomena in the strong interactions . and",
    "it certainly appears that they do . \"",
    "indeed lattice simulation with qcd with no mass terms and with the heavy quarks @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ignored , termed  qcdlite \" by wilczek , predicts @xmath7 of the proton mass .",
    "if pressed to explain in more detail , they will then say it comes from the massless gluons interacting with the nearly massless , high - momentum quarks , winding up confined in a  bag . \" in a nutshell , one may say the mass is generated due to the breaking of chiral symmetry associated with the nearly massless quarks by the confinement@xcite . in the standard paradigm , the chiral symmetry spontaneously broken leading to the mass generation",
    "is characterized by the quark condensate , @xmath8 , the order parameter for chiral symmetry .",
    "to nuclear physicists , ironically , this explanation raises more questions than answers .",
    "this may be due to the fact that confinement is very poorly  if at all  understood .",
    "for mathematicians , it is  one - million dollar clay millenium problem , \" still to be solved .",
    "it may even be , as some argue , that  deconfinement , \" corollary to confinement , does not take place within the framework of qcd@xcite . for nuclear physicists ,",
    "it presents numerous puzzles , some of which bear directly on observables as i will describe below .",
    "one extremely simple picture of how confinement could lead to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is to look at a massless dirac particle  let me call it quark  swimming in one space dimension to the right on top of the dirac sea .",
    "suppose there is an infinitely tall impenetrable wall on the right of what i will call the  jain cell . \"",
    "the swimmer , bumping into the wall , has no choice but to turn back or drown .",
    "now chiral symmetry forbids the swimmer from turning and swimming back unscathed to the left on _ top _ of the dirac sea .",
    "it could swim back on top of the sea only if the quark picked up a mass , that is , if chiral symmetry were broken ",
    "explicitly  by the wall .",
    "the wall of the  jail - cell \" could then be the source of the mass@xcite .",
    "this is the well - known mit bag picture of the hadron . but how does this give the mass ?",
    "the jail wall , one might say , is erected by the as - yet un - understood strong quark - gluon dynamics and the existence of the mass is then the consequence , in the qcdlite , of the chiral symmetry broken by the jail wall , making the quark condensate nonzero .",
    "this may sound fine , but there is something missing here , and that is the nambu - goldstone theorem that chiral symmetry realized with a non - zero condensate in massless theory like qcdlite must have zero - mass pions , namely , nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons .",
    "it has been understood since many years that pions are absolutely essential for nuclear physics , although it was not clear how they figured precisely until meson - exchange currents were understood with the advent of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "there are many different ways to bring in pions and have them couple to the quarks in the nucleon .",
    "this accounts for the variety of models found in the literature that incorporate chiral symmetry , such as chiral bag , chiral soliton , cloudy bag etc .",
    "it is very possible that different ways , constructed in consistency with symmetries and invariances involved , could lead to qualitatively similar results . here",
    "i will adopt the approach called  chiral bag \" since it is in that picture that i can address the issues involved with some confidence .    in the chiral bag model@xcite ,",
    "both the pions and the confinement of quarks / gluons are taken to be indispensable in the structure of the elementary proton as well as that of the nucleus . in this model ,",
    "the pion , a nb boson ( in qcdlite ) , is not just a propagating field but contains highly nonlinear mean - field components that encode topology .",
    "let us then look again , this time taking into account the intricacy involving the ng boson , at the one - dimensional swimmer confined in the jail - cell@xcite .",
    "as the quark @xmath9 bumps into the wall , it is subject to a boundary condition imposed by the wall , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the outwardly - directed unit 2-vector and @xmath9 is the quark field .",
    "this is a classical condition imposed by the vector current conservation .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath12 , so the quark charge is confined .",
    "but we are forgetting here that there is pion that couples , due to chiral invariance , to the quark at the surface .",
    "the coupling modifies the boundary condition to in^_=-e^i_5/fwhere @xmath13 is the one - dimensional ",
    "pion \" field and @xmath14 is a constant  one dimensional analog to the pion decay constant @xmath15 .",
    "classically the charge is still conserved .",
    "but quantum mechanically , the coupling brings in divergences , and as is well known in field theory the divergence has to be regulated to make the theory sensible .",
    "the regularization turns out make the fermion ( quark ) charge @xmath16 no longer conserved , making it leak out of the bag as @xmath17 .",
    "formally this is a consequence of the vector - current anomaly generated at the bag boundary when the axial current conservation is imposed .",
    "for the quark swimmer , what happens at the bag wall then is that the helicity conservation forces the swimmer to plunge into the dirac sea and swim back to the left under the dirac surface .",
    "this plunge into the occupied dirac sea , made possible due to what is called  infinite - hotel phenomenon\"@xcite , however , makes the fermion charge disappear from the system .",
    "but we have a theory in which the charge should be conserved .",
    "so what happens to the fermion charge that disappears as the quark plunges into the sea",
    "?    here the penny drops !",
    "the leaking charge is picked up by the soliton from the pion outside of the bag . in terms of the so - called  chiral angle \" @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the position of the bag wall , the leaking charge depends on the size of the cell , @xmath20 .",
    "the soliton carries away precisely this leaked charge . for what s referred to as the  magic angle \" @xmath21 ,",
    "the fermion charge is precisely 1/2 inside and 1/2 outside of the bag . for any angle @xmath22",
    ", it is partitioned in such a way that the total is precisely 1 .",
    "involving topology , exactly the same leakage of charge should take place also in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions and indeed it does .",
    "the soliton that carries the leaking charge is the famous skyrmion@xcite .",
    "this was first shown in @xcite for the case of the  magic angle \" in @xmath23 dimensions where the baryon charge is partitioned half - and - half as in @xmath24 dimensions .",
    "it turns out , however , that even though many nuclear properties seem to work well when described at the  magic angle , \" there is nothing special  except for numerical efficiency  about this angle .",
    "the partition does indeed take place for _ any _ chiral angle as was shown quite convincingly by goldstone and jaffe@xcite . in this picture",
    ", the fermion ( baryon ) charge is _ not confined _ inside the bag .",
    "this phenomenon is dubbed ",
    "cheshire cat phenomenon\"@xcite drawing an analogy from the famous smile of cheshire cat in ",
    "alice in the wonderland \" of lewis carol .",
    "one might attribute the above cc phenomenon to the topological quantity .",
    "what about processes that are not topological ? what about , for instance , the color charge that has to do with confinement but is not connected to topology ?",
    "does the color charge leak ?",
    "the answer is : yes it also leaks .",
    "this is because just like the baryon charge , the color charge is also broken by the vector anomaly .",
    "classically the color is confined within the bag by the vector current conservation , but quantum mechanically it leaks out at the bag boundary . here",
    "the culprit is the @xmath25 associated with the @xmath26 anomaly .",
    "lodged outside of the bag , like pions , the @xmath25 couples to the quark at the boundary and induces a color electric field normal to the surface .",
    "but unlike the baryon charge which can be transferred to the soliton in the pion outside , there is nothing outside that can carry the leaking color charge .",
    "the @xmath25 causing for the anomaly is color singlet .",
    "the only way color gauge symmetry can be preserved is then to append to to the wall a color - symmetry - breaking counter term to stop the flow of quantum - induced color@xcite .",
    "note that this counter term is classical , so the lagrangian at the classical level is color - gauge non - invariant .",
    "this is contrary to what usually happens in gauge theories without boundaries where symmetries conserved in the lagrangian are broken quantum mechanically , such as , e.g. , @xmath26 anomaly , trace anomaly etc ..     ( or  matter \" ) contribution ( @xmath27 ) , ( b ) the contribution of the static gluons due to quark source ( @xmath28 ) , ( c ) the gluon casimir contribution ( @xmath29 ) , and ( d ) the sum of ( a)-(c ) ( @xmath30 . the shaded area corresponds to the range admitted by experiments.,width=377 ]      how does the cheshire cat phenomenon manifest itself in physical processes that involve neither baryon charge ( topology ) nor color charge ( gauge invariance ) directly ?",
    "a good example for answering this question is the flavor singlet axial coupling constant ( fsac ) @xmath31 in the current @xmath32 .",
    "the fsac became famous because of the so - called  proton spin crisis \" which turned out be a false alarm .",
    "the @xmath31 in general is a form factor depending on the momentum transfer involved which in some kinematical condition is related to the proton spin .",
    "but the axial charge at zero momentum transfer that i will denote as @xmath33 has nothing directly to do with the proton spin . what is of relevance to what i am discussing here intricately involves quarks and gluons inside the bag and @xmath34 and @xmath25 outside  with the baryon charge fractionization and the color - charge anomaly cancelation ",
    "so in the chiral bag model topology as well as confinement figure in @xmath35 .",
    "one can write down a simple chiral - bag lagrangian that encodes all the above properties .",
    "one was written down in @xcite and applied to the explicit calculation of the fsac in @xcite .",
    "the details are given in the references , so i wo nt go into them .",
    "the result , shown in fig",
    ".  [ fsac ] , illustrates clearly how the cheshire cat principle works .",
    "while the individual contributions from inside and outside are widely varying in terms of the  confinement radius \" @xmath19 the total has , within the approximations made , no visible dependence on @xmath19 . the bag model ( e.g. ,",
    " mit bag \" ) and the skyrmion are in a sense equivalent .",
    "this is a signal that at low energy / momentum , physical properties may very well be  blind \" to the  confinement \" size .",
    "in fact , one can even formulate , within the framework of chiral bag , the notion that the  bag size \" is a gauge artifact , meaning that one can pick any @xmath19 without changing physics@xcite . in this description",
    ", deconfinement seems irrelevant .",
    "so what can one say about the source for the proton mass based on the cheshire cat phenomenon ?",
    "up to here , it only connects the skyrmion to the bag but says nothing on the mass .",
    "we will come to this matter below .",
    "according to a general argument for baryon structure in qcd deduced in the large @xmath36 limit , the only nonpertubative tool available for approaching qcd in nonperturbative regime of high density , the constituent quark model should be equivalent to the skyrmion model .",
    "i will exploit this equivalence in what follows .      in nambu s pathbreaking paper@xcite ,",
    "it is stated in conclusion  ... our model hamiltonian , though very simple , has been found to produce results which strongly simulate the general characteristics of real nucleons and mesons .",
    "it is quite appealing that both the nucleon mass and the pseudo - scalar ` pion ' are of the same dynamical origin , and the reason behind this can be easily understood in terms of ( 1 ) classical concepts such as attraction or repulsion between particles , and ( 2 ) the @xmath37 symmetry . \" for convenience i will refer to this statement as defining  nambu mechanism . \"    in the context of modern development , it seems more appropriate to replace the  proton \" in the nambu scenario by  constituent quark \"  that i shall equivalently refer to as  quasiquark \" ( denoted @xmath16 )  and to view the proton ( nucleon ) as a bound state of three @xmath16s with the mass @xmath38 generated by the nambu mechanism . in this model a meson ,",
    "say , @xmath0 meson , is a constituent - quark - constituent - antiquark ( @xmath39 ) bound state .",
    "the interactions between @xmath16s are supposed to be weak , thereby justifying the term  quasiquark \" in analogy to quasiparticles in many - nucleon systems .",
    "this @xmath16 picture is justifiable in the large @xmath36 limit from qcd@xcite .",
    "in fact , this description is known to work very well , encompassing all light - quark hadrons , mesons and baryons . if the quasiquark mass @xmath40 arises from the nambu mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking ( ccb ) , then if one were to  unbreak \" the symmetry by density ( or temperature ) such that @xmath41 , then we should expect that @xmath42 . 0.3 cm @xmath43 * q(uasiquark ) scenario * : in approaching @xmath44 at which @xmath41 , the masses would scale @xmath45 and @xmath46 in such a way that @xmath47 . here",
    "it is assumed that the quasiparticle picture holds in dense matter .",
    "the sharp bag boundary set up in the discussions given above could very well be an artifact of approximation . in nature",
    ", the leakage process could be smooth .",
    "the cheshire cat implies that when the bag is shrunk , all properties of quarks and gluons will be transferred to the topological soliton , the skyrmion .",
    "the mass generated in the qcdlite by confinement must then be lodged in the lump of soliton . in this picture",
    "there is nothing special with single skyrmion , proton .",
    "it can be a nucleus with the mass number @xmath48 given by the winding number @xmath48 . in the mathematics community , this feature is being exploited to unify in terms of complex geometry the proton structure to the nuclear as well as atomic structure@xcite .",
    "seen from this vista , there is nothing special about the proton from , say , the carbon-12 nucleus .",
    "indeed , the nucleus @xmath49c including the subtle structure of hoyle states can be understood as a skyrmion with winding number 12@xcite .",
    "it is equally well described in chiral perturbation theory with baryonic chiral lagrangians@xcite and also in no - core shell model@xcite .",
    "the dynamics involved in these descriptions , ranging from skyrmions to effective field theories  la weinberg s folk theorem to the traditional shell - model implemented with symmetry properties of chiral symmetry seem to tell more or less the same story .",
    "the key question is : how can one decode the source of the  proton mass \" going from skyrmions to quark - gluon structure as indicated by the cheshire cat phenomenon which is most likely different form the @xmath16 scenario ?    to address this question , let us  unbreak \" the symmetries involved ",
    "e.g. ,  uncondense \" the quark condensate  by going to highly dense baryonic matter as one expects to encounter in compact stars .",
    "to do this , i consider putting skyrmions on crystal lattice and squeezing the lattice size .    if one accepts that ( 1 ) the skyrmion structure is a good description of nucleons in the large @xmath36 limit and ( 2 ) skyrmions on crystals are a reliable model for baryonic matter at high density , then the first observation is the remarkable phenomenon that as density is increased beyond the normal nuclear matter density @xmath50 @xmath51 , the skyrmions in baryonic matter fractionize into half - skyrmions . at present , due to incomplete understanding of the model , it is not feasible to give an accurate value for the transition density , but based on certain sophisticated lagrangians to be described below combined with available phenomenology , the transition density is estimated to be @xmath52 .",
    "it can not be much lower as there is no indication from available experimental data .",
    "it can not be much higher , for in that case , the model can not be trusted .",
    "this is just about the density regime that one expects to be able to probe in various accelerators for nuclear physics , for example , raon in korea . also that a soliton can turn into various fractionized solitons is widely conjectured and in some cases observed in nature (",
    "see for instance @xcite ) . for the skyrmion in question",
    ", one can actually mathematically verify that the fractionization of a skyrmion takes place in the presence of a certain potential term of  heisenberg type\"@xcite .",
    "such a potential is not present in ( generalized ) lagrangians currently studied so it is somewhat academic , but as i will describe there is scale symmetry that could generate such a potential in dense medium@xcite . in any event",
    ", there is an indirect indication for half - skyrmion structure already in the @xmath53 particle in which four nucleons are strongly bound@xcite .",
    "the fractionization on crystal lattice at a density @xmath54 has been observed since some time in the skyrme model ( with pions only ) or generalized models with massive degrees of freedom @xcite . as indicated in the mathematical investigation@xcite ,",
    "the fractionized skyrmions are most likely confined , non - propagating degrees of freedom . of great significance to what i am discussing here",
    "is that when the skyrmions fractionize into half - skyrmions , the quark condensate @xmath55 , which is non - zero both globally and locally in the skyrmion phase , vanishes when averaged over the crystal lattice .",
    "let me denote this averaged condensate by @xmath56 .",
    "while vanishing on the average , however , the chiral condensate @xmath55 supports chiral density wave in the half - skyrmion phase@xcite .",
    "this means that there is a sort of phase transition in the change of topology with the condensate vanishing on averaging .",
    "but there is still pion in the matter , with nonzero @xmath15 , hence chiral symmetry is still broken .",
    "note that there is no obvious local - field order parameter .",
    "it is an unusual state of matter , but such states are observed in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "the questions then are : is this phenomenon , if not an artifact of crystal structure , relevant to nuclear physics ? if it is , how to implement this phenomenon , atopology change , \" in the proton mass problem ?",
    "the answer to the first question is yes and the answer to the second is what i turn to next .",
    "the first question raised above is generic and does not depend on what other degrees of freedom than pion are involved .",
    "however the answer to the second question involves both vector mesons and scalar mesons .",
    "they influence neither the topological structure of matter  which is controlled by the pion field only nor the cheshire cat phenomenon .",
    "but it is found that they play extremely important roles for nuclear interactions within the framework of the effective field theory model i am using .",
    "two hidden symmetries are found to be involved : one , hidden gauge symmetry for the vector mesons @xmath57 and the other , hidden scale symmetry for a low - mass scalar meson ( @xmath58 ) . from here on i will focus on the @xmath0 meson ( the hidden symmetry argument applies also to @xmath59 , though in a different way in dense medium ) and the dilaton @xmath58 associated with the spontaneous breaking of scale symmetry .",
    "nuclear interactions that enter in nuclear structure probe energy / momentum scales up to order of the vector ( @xmath0)-meson mass . in the spirit of effective field theory , a natural procedure is then to introduce the @xmath0 field explicitly . a powerful  and perhaps the most predictive  way is to resort to the hidden local symmetric lagrangian which is gauge - equivalent to non - linear @xmath58 model@xcite",
    ". the pion field of the sigma model @xmath60 has the redundancy @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "this redundancy can be exploited to elevate the energy / momentum scale to the vector meson mass scale by gauging the vector @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to hidden local symmetry with the kinetic energy generated dynamically by loop corrections@xcite .",
    "there is magic in this approach if one assumes that the vector meson mass can be taken ",
    "it is not understood how the magic comes about , but when treated to the leading order ( at which calculations can be done easily ) it gives some remarkable results such as the ksrf relation ( to all - loop order ) , vector dominance etc . which are difficult to obtain in standard chiral perturbation approaches .",
    "associated with the magic that goes with  light \" vector meson , there is one specially distinctive prediction which is not present in other approaches , namely , at some high density ( and perhaps also at high temperature ) which may precede possible deconfinement , the @xmath0-meson mass approaches zero as the critical density ( to be denoted @xmath63 ) is approached .",
    "a renormalization - group analysis@xcite showed that as the quark condensate is dialed to zero , the @xmath0 mass which is given by the ksrf formula @xmath64 goes as m_~g_0 .",
    "it should be noted that it is not the pion decay constant but the hidden gauge coupling @xmath65 that controls the property of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "this can be understood with hidden scale symmetry ( discussed below ) : .",
    "the @xmath0 mass is scale - invariant in the vacuum and is expected to remain scale - invariant in medium .",
    "the point at which the mass vanishes is referred to as  vector manifestation ( vm ) fixed point . \" as stressed in @xcite , the vm fixed point is _ not _ in qcd proper .",
    "it may be not only _ hidden _ but also _ non - reachable _ in qcd in the vacuum .",
    "however it is suggested that it can be generated in highly dense medium .",
    "it will turn out in what follows that the approach near to the vmfp  which may be different from the chiral symmetry restoration density @xmath44  can play a crucial role in compact - star matter .",
    "another hidden symmetry highly relevant to nuclear dynamics is global scale symmetry , presumably connected to a low - mass scalar @xmath58 .",
    "qcd at classical level is scale - invariant in  qcdlite , \" i.e. , @xmath66 for @xmath67 for non - strange nuclear interactions and also @xmath68 if strangeness is involved , but the scale symmetry is broken quantum mechanically by the qcd trace - anomaly .",
    "it is renormalization - group invariant , so can not be turned off in qcd dynamics .",
    "however similarly to the @xmath69 anomaly , it may be restored or rather made  emerging \" in medium , particularly at high density .",
    "it is this possibility that i will explore for probing the source of the proton mass .",
    "a scalar meson of mass @xmath70 mev has been playing a very important role in nuclear physics , in , say , nuclear forces , relativistic mean - field models etc .",
    "but it has been totally unclear what that scalar is in qcd@xcite . in particle physics ,",
    "the  low - lying \" scalar higgs scalar @xmath71 poses a similar puzzle . in one of the candidate scenarios for higgs , it is identified as a ng boson associated with broken scale symmetry with an infrared ( ir ) fixed point for @xmath72@xcite .",

    "standard chiral perturbation theory with baryons explicitly implemented is based on this framework . on the other hand ,",
    "the weak coupling limit @xmath76 gives rise to a scale - invariant nonlinear sigma model with scale symmetry broken only in a potential that encodes the trace anomaly of qcd . in the dilatonic higgs model of @xcite ,",
    "the higgs mass can be small because it is near the ir fixed point .",
    "now the central point of this article : _ in nuclei and nuclear matter , by dialing density , one can sample from the strong coupling regime to the weak coupling regime . _ in the strong coupling limit which is applicable to low - energy hadronic interactions in the matter - free vacuum , nonlinear sigma model works , with the fourth component of the chiral four vector banished to infinity ( say @xmath77 gev ) .",

    "both postulate the presence of an ir fixed point at which scale ( conformal ) invariance is restored and its spontaneous breaking gives rise to a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( in the presence of the trace anomaly ) .",

    "this cusp is a generic phenomenon involving the pion field only associated with the topology change .",

    "i will discuss below what this implies in the nuclear tensor force as the density @xmath96 is approached from below .",
    "another surprising observation at @xmath92 is that the effective mass of the nucleon in the skyrmion medium reveals a hidden parity - doublet symmetry with a nonzero mass @xmath97 as @xmath98@xcite m_n = m_0 + m()[mass ] with @xmath99 as @xmath98 at @xmath100 .",
    "since pions are still present in the half - skyrmion phase , @xmath98 may not be interpreted as the restoration of chiral symmetry .",

    "so where does this chiral scalar mass come from ? how is this related to the mass generated by the cheshire cat mechanism i started with ?",
    "this is the question nuclear physicists would like to find the answer to .",
    "as noted above , the skyrmion model and then quasiquark model for the nucleon are equivalent in the large @xmath36 limit .",
    "the quasiquark model unifies baryons and mesons and works very well when corrected with certain @xmath111 corrections for various static and dynamic properties .",
    "the origin of mass for both the proton and the @xmath0 is the constituent quark mass given by the dynamically generated quark condensate .",
    "especially , their masses have a simple ratio , e.g. , @xmath112 .    now",
    "the skyrmion approach is also a unified approach as skyrme suggested in his seminal paper  and more generally in @xmath84hls  in that it involves one  unified \" lagrangian that accounts for both mesons and baryons .",

    "there are therefore no such simple mass relations between the mesons and baryons as in the quasiquark model .",
    "in fact i see no logical connection between the two in the cheshire cat scenario as will be specified below .",
    "furthermore a tension arises between the skyrmion picture and the quasiquark picture when we go to dense matter . while the proton mass moves to a constant @xmath113 after shedding off @xmath114 subject to the decrease in the quark condensate , the @xmath0 mass which",

    "furthermore in this picture , there would be a tremendous increase in excitations of both parities in the spectra of both baryons and mesons in medium , even at normal matter density which is accessible in the laboratories .",

    "i suggest that this scenario is favored in nuclear physics .",
    "let me now turn to what nature says about the issues discussed above and what one can infer from them .",
    "the cusp observed above in the symmetry energy given by the skyrmion crystal can be reproduced by the behavior of the tensor forces in nuclear interactions .",
    "it is due to the fact that nuclear symmetry energy is dominated by the tensor forces . in terms of the lagrangian",
    "used in this paper , @xmath84hls , the ( total ) tensor force is given by one - pion and one-@xmath0 exchanges . in calculating the effective forces ,",
    "one is to take into account the coupling constants and masses of the mesons involved in the exchanges that are scaling with density .",
    "the density dependence is prescribed by both the intrinsic density dependence ( idd for short ) inherited from qcd at the scale at which the correlators of qcd and effective theory are matched and the in - medium renormalization group properties of the effective field theory , @xmath84hls .",
    "what s involved here are two things .",
    "first the @xmath34-exchange tensor force and the @xmath0-exchange tensor force come with opposite signs so they tend to cancel in the range of forces entering in the pertinent nuclear interactions .",
    "the pion mass and coupling constants are protected by nearly exact chiral symmetry , consequently the pion tensor is more or less unaffected by density . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0 tensor increases in strength with the @xmath0 mass falling as density increases toward @xmath92 and then gets quenched strongly by the hidden gauge coupling @xmath116 going toward zero as the vm fixed point is approached .",
    "the net effect is then that the sum of the two tensor forces decreases due to the cancelation between them up to @xmath92 and then is taken over by the pion tensor with the @xmath0 tensor suppressed , hence increasing beyond @xmath92 .",
    "this property is seen in the left panel of fig.[tensor ] .     and",

    "this simple form follows from the fact that the tensor force predominantly excites from the ground state to excited states peaked at @xmath127 mev .",
    "this expression leads to the @xmath91 that decreases as @xmath89 approaches @xmath92 and then increases as @xmath89 goes above @xmath92 .",
    "this is precisely the cusp structure predicted by the skyrmion model .",
    "it should be mentioned that this behavior of @xmath91 supports the scaling behavior of the @xmath84hls lagrangian described above in the tensor force channel .",
    "it is important to note that what plays a crucial role here is the vm fixed point toward which dense matter flows .",
    "it is fairly well recognized that the symmetry energy @xmath91 is the most important ingredient in the equation of state ( eos ) for massive compact stars . and",
    "it is also the most poorly known at high density .",
    "thus the tensor force is the key ingredient for compact - star physics yet to be figured out .",
    "if the scenario described above is correct , a reliable approach to the eos involves an intricate combination of topology change and in - medium properties of nucleons and mesons , specially the @xmath0 meson .",
    "it should of course be recognized that the symmetry energy @xmath91 in nuclear matter is more involved than just what the tensor force gives .",
    "it can get contributions from different components of the nuclear force .",
    "in fact at low density , the closure - approximated expression for @xmath91 can not be reliable .",
    "this is because first of all , the topology structure inferred from skyrmion crystal can not be trusted at low density . furthermore it is known that the cluster structure of matter can be important at low density .",
    "nonetheless the behavior for @xmath128 is expected to be trustful as it is mainly controlled by the vm fixed point .",
    "a full rg flow calculation using @xmath124 potential described below gives the symmetry energy given in fig.[tensor ] ( right pannel ) .",

    "exploring the behavior of the tensor force in nuclei is a fertile and challenging field in nuclear physics .",
    "i give a few illustrations as to where it stands .",
    "the long lifetime for the gamow - teller transition in @xmath130c presents a case where the structure of the tensor force is exposed at a matter density near @xmath82@xcite .",
    "it sheds light on complex and highly intricate interplay between the pion tensor force and the @xmath0 tensor force at matter densities near @xmath82 . as shown in fig.[tensor ] ( left panel ) and discussed above , up to @xmath131 , the net tensor force at the range relevant to the process decreases as density increases , nearly vanishing at @xmath96 .",
    "this cancelation manifests spectacularly in the gamow - teller matrix element involved in the transition @xmath130c @xmath132 @xmath130n because the gt matrix element nearly vanishes as density approaches @xmath82 around which the wave functions overlap .",
    "what is significant in this process is that the transition involved samples the density regime where such cancelation takes place and the energy spectrum in @xmath130n for the corresponding states comes out in perfect agreement with experiments .",
    "this provides a consistency check between the weak current and the hamiltonian , both of which scale with @xmath133 which , in scale - chiral effective theory , is locked to @xmath134 .",
    "it should be pointed out clearly that the cancelation in the transition matrix element , although consistent in a nontrivial way with the hamiltonian giving the energy spectrum , involves an interplay of complicated many - body correlations and can not single out unequivocally the role of the tensor force subject to the scaling parameters .",

    "the c-14 dating case offers no clear hint due to the intricate interplay between the tensor force with other components of the nuclear force .",
    "fortunately there is a case , known up to date , relevant to the issue which hints at the direction to take .",
    "it is shell evolution in exotic nuclei .",
    "it has been suggested that one of the underlying causes for shell evolution is based on the strong monopole part of effective nucleon - nucleon interactions for which the tensor force is found to play an important role in the appearance or disappearance of the spherical magic numbers in light - mass nuclei , and for heavier nuclei , in the observed drift of single- particle levels along the @xmath148 isotonic and the sb ( @xmath149 ) isotopic chains@xcite .",
