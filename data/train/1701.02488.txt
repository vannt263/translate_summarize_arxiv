    "the analysis of @xcite gave a slightly lower value of mass about @xmath4 @xmath3 for the region of radius @xmath5 pc with average gas density in the cnd of about @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "unlike other regions of the galaxy the central region shows prominent emissions in a very broad range of electromagnetic waves , from radio to gamma - ray .    * the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ) @xcite and the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) @xcite detected a prominent gamma - ray flux in the tev energy range .",

    "the estimated gamma - ray flux from this source for @xmath11 gev is @xmath12 erg @xmath13 s@xmath14 with a spectral index @xmath15 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this corresponds to a luminosity about @xmath16 erg s@xmath14 . the positional error circle of 2fgl j1745.6@xmath02858 overlaps with sgr a@xmath1 .",
    "this is compatible with the picture that its emission originates within the cnd or within the central cavity .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this emission is provided either by crs protons @xcite , or by cr electrons @xcite , or by both protons and electrons @xcite produced in the vicinity of sgr a@xmath1 .",
    "+ independent analysis of the _ fermi _ lat   data by @xcite and @xcite indicated that recovered by them spectra are compatible with 2fgl j1745.6@xmath02858 data at gev energies yet significantly softer in the sub - gev range . + in the _ fermi _ lat   4-year point source catalog ( 3fgl ) @xcite , this source was identified as 3fgl j1745.6@xmath02859c .",
    "however the gamma - ray spectrum of this source is significantly softer below 1 gev in comparison to 2fgl j1745.6@xmath02858 .",
    "the discrepancy may be due to another bright source 3fgl j1745.3@xmath02903c in this area , which was not identified in the second catalog . since there is a flag `` c '' in the name of the source",
    "the reliability of the derived spectrum of 3fgl j1745.6@xmath02859c is not very high due to the contamination from the nearby bright source . in this paper",
    "we do not judge which analysis is more appropriate , instead we present our model fittings for both 3fgl data and data obtained by @xcite . *",
    "large scale diffuse radio emission from this region is known as radio halo .",
    "it has a spherical shape with radius of about 8 pc . at frequencies about tens of ghz",
    "the emission have a clear synchrotron nature and thus confirms the presence of high - energy electrons in this area @xcite .",
    "* the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ( _ nustar _ ) found a flux of non - thermal hard x - ray emission in the direction of the central few parsecs region of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "total luminosity in the energy range 20 - 40 kev was estimated as @xmath17 erg s@xmath14 , which corresponds to an energy flux at the earth of @xmath18 erg @xmath13 s@xmath14 .",
    "spatial profile of the emission has an elliptical shape with a major axis 8 pc and a minor axis 4 pc .",
    "it is larger than gas structures in the gc like the central cavity ( 1.2 pc in diameter ) and cnd ( 6 pc in diameter ) @xcite .",
    "it also does not spatially coincide with sgr a east .",
    "however it looks similar to the nuclear star cluster ( 8 pc by 5.6 pc , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore it was concluded that this emission was produced by unresolved point like sources .",
    "this idea was further developed by @xcite who concluded that the x - ray emission can be produced by intermediate polars ( a type of cataclysmic variables ) with masses of about 0.9 solar masses .",
    "+ despite the fact that point - like sources potentially play a major role in the hard x - ray emission we suppose that there is still room for a diffuse component of x - rays generated by crs .",
    "indeed as we mentioned earlier the presence of high - energy protons or electrons is confirmed by gamma - ray and radio observations .",
    "it is perceivable that these energetic particles also contribute to the total hard x - ray flux from the gc .",
    "+ in principle , hard x - ray photons may be generated by synchrotron emission of secondary high - energy electrons produced by collisions of tev protons with the background gas in the gc region .",
    "recent observations of tev gamma - ray point - like source detected a clear cut - off in the gamma - ray spectrum @xcite at around 12 tev .",
    "this gives the maximum energy of primary protons at about @xmath19 tev .",
    "the maximum energy of secondary electrons is thus about @xmath20 tev ( see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , in order to produce a non - thermal emission with power - law spectrum up to 40 kev by secondary electrons , the magnetic field strength there should be about 16 mg . this value is significantly higher than the @xmath21 mg obtained by @xcite .",
    "hence we must conclude that synchrotron origin of this x - rays is doubtful .",
    "+ if however the cut - off in the spectrum of this source is due to absorption of the gamma - ray photons by their interactions with background infra - red emission as suggested by @xcite , the spectrum of primary protons may be power - law up to energies higher than 140 tev . in this case synchrotron emission",
    "can produce up to 10%-20% of the flux detected by _ nustar _   depending on the magnetic field strength .",
    "we note however that the density of the infra - red photons does not appear to be high enough to produce the observed cut - off in the gamma - ray spectrum by photon - photon ( @xmath22 ) collisions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , x - rays can be generated by electron bremsstrahlung or inverse compton effect ( or both ) .",
    "this model was developed in @xcite .",
    "they assumed that the gamma - ray flux of the source 2fgl j1745.6@xmath02858 is generated by relativistic protons in cnd .",
    "the secondary electrons produce a flux of hard x - rays by bremsstrahlung in cnd and by inverse compton effect in the region surrounding cnd .",
    "then the x - ray halo around cnd could be more extended than the gas distribution as observed by _",
    "nustar_. however , @xcite considered a spherically symmetric model which is unable to explain the observed asymmetry of the hard x - ray emission . besides , the hard x - ray flux predicted in that work turned out to be significantly lower than the observed value .",
    "therefore , modification of the model is required if this interpretation is correct .",
    "thus , these observations indicate a high efficiency cr production in the gc . additional evidence supporting high density of crs in the gc came from the measured ionization rate in the 1 pc region of cnd by @xcite .",
    "they obtained a value @xmath23 s@xmath14 , which is one order of magnitude higher than in other parts of the galaxy .",
    "this ionization is most likely produced by subrelativistic crs with a density higher than those outside the gc region .",
    "the estimated source luminosity of these subrelativistic crs in the gc is about @xmath24 erg s@xmath14 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the goal of our present investigation is to explain simultaneously all phenomena mentioned above except tev gamma - ray emission in the framework of a single model where crs are injected from the central source .",
    "this source may be stationary @xcite or transient @xcite .",
    "both possibilities will be discussed .",
    "we will estimate the required parameters of this source .",
    "we analyze two types of models of the source :    * _ hadronic model_. the central source injects mainly high energy protons .",
    "most of the non - thermal electrons is produced by interactions of these protons with background medium .",
    "gamma - rays are generated by proton - proton ( pp ) collisions .",
    "x - rays are produced by protons via inverse bremsstrahlung and by secondary electrons through bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering .",
    "radio emission is produced by synchrotron losses of secondary electrons . * _ leptonic model_.",
    "the central source injects primary high energy electrons . in this case gamma - ray and hard x - ray emission",
    "are mainly produced by their bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering .",
    "radio flux is produced by their synchrotron emission .",
    "unlike previous investigations our goal is to explain all types of non - thermal emissions using the same injection of particles ( protons or electrons ) .",
    "the ultimate goal is to reproduce the observed hard x - ray spectrum and the spatial distribution of hard x - rays using the observed gamma - ray spectrum as a reference point to determine the injection and propagation parameters .",
    "also we examine whether the estimated gamma - ray flux in the models is compatible with other observations there , such as the radio emission and the ionization rate of molecular hydrogen .",
    "below we take into account the non - spherical shape of the gas distribution in the central few parsecs .",
    "the parameters of the gas distribution in the cnd region are taken from @xcite .    in this investigation",
    "we assume that tev gamma - ray emission discovered by h.e.s.s .   and veritas , and gev gamma - ray emission discovered by _",
    "lat   are produced by two different sources .",
    "indeed the overall gamma - ray spectrum indicates an `` ankle - like '' break at the transition from gev to tev energies .",
    "this break can be described naturally by a combination of two components with different spectral indices . since tev component exhibits much harder spectrum , its contribution to x - rays , radio emission and ionization should be much lower in comparison to gev component",
    ". therefore we restrict our analysis to gev gamma - rays only .",
    "we use a cylindrically symmetric model to study the evolution of proton and electron distribution functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 with time .",
    "the @xmath27 plane corresponds to the cnd plane of symmetry , and the origin @xmath28 corresponds to the center of the cnd with sgr a@xmath1 as the source .",
    "equation for the distribution functions is @xmath29 = q_{p , e}(t , r , z , e)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we assume that the diffusion is isotropic and the diffusion coefficient @xmath30 has different values inside and outside the molecular cloud .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is a function of particle rigidity ,    @xmath31    where the value of @xmath32 is the same for protons and electrons , @xmath33 is the particle momentum , @xmath34 is the particle velocity in the units of @xmath35 , @xmath36 gev@xmath37 , and the spectral index @xmath38 is determined by the spectrum of mhd - turbulence for non - magnetized particles or by a structure of magnetic field lines for magnetized particles . outside the cloud",
    "we assume that the diffusion is mainly due to energetic particle scattering by the interstellar turbulence with kolmogorov spectrum and therefore @xmath39 @xcite .    inside the molecular cloud , however , the situation is quite different due to the very efficient damping of mhd waves by ion - neutral friction . in this case diffusion is due to tangled magnetic field . therefore the mean - free path of charged particles is determined by the characteristic correlation length of the intracloud magnetic field . as a result",
    "the diffusion coefficient does not depend on particle rigidity and @xmath40 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the parameter @xmath32 in the gc center region and inside the cnd is unknown .",
    "for some regions of the galaxy , it can be estimated from observational data .",
    "@xcite gave a value of @xmath41 @xmath42 s@xmath14 as an average over the galaxy diffusion coefficient .",
    "as for intracloud , diffusion estimations for cloud such as sgr b2 gave a value of about @xmath43 @xmath42 s@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , the inner few parsec of the galaxy are located in a special region characterized by processes of effective energy release in different forms .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the diffusion coefficient there is significantly smaller than in the other part of the gc region .",
    "we estimate this parameter from the spatial and spectral properties of the emissions .",
    "the energy loss term @xmath44 in equation  ( [ eq : kin_eq_p ] ) consist of coulomb losses and proton - proton losses for protons @xcite , and of coulomb , bremsstrahlung , inverse - compton and synchrotron losses for electrons @xcite .",

    "x - ray emissivity can be estimated as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the cross - section of the inverse - bremsstrahlung process @xcite .    to obtain the spatial distribution of x - rays across the sky , the emissivity should be integrated along the line - of - sight .",
    "we take into account the fact that cnd is inclined to the galactic plane by @xmath66 ( see figure  [ fig : gasmap ] ) .",

    "equations  ( [ eq : eq_gammarays ] ) , ( [ eq : eq_xrays ] ) and ( [ eq : eq_ioniz ] ) are applicable to both hadronic and leptonic models . obviously , in the case of leptonic model we assume @xmath70 and ignore all terms related to protons .",
    "we start from injection spectrum of primary protons .",
    "energetic electrons are considered as secondaries and their source function is @xmath71 where the cross - section @xmath72 of electron production includes proton - proton collision term @xcite and the knock - on term @xcite .",
    "the source function of protons is model - dependent .",
    "we adopt the following form , @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are dirac delta - functions of @xmath76 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "@xmath77 is the spectrum of the injected particles and @xmath78 describes the temporal variations of the injection .",
    "the injected particle spectrum is assumed to be a power - law in momentum space , i.e. , @xmath79 where @xmath33 is the momentum of the particle , @xmath80 is a spectral index of of the injection spectrum and @xmath81 is total number of particles with momenta higher than @xmath33 .",
    "one should note that a momentum power - law distribution of particles is expected inside of accelerator while the injected spectrum of particles may be modified by energy losses or escape which will potentially develop a spectral break .",
    "this is really important since we perform calculations in a wide energy range - from non - relativistic to ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "however in the particular case of the hadronic model we would like to maximize potential x - ray emission so we assume that particles are injected with power - law spectrum without any breaks .",
    "after re - expressing equation  ( [ eq : eq_a_momentum ] ) in terms of kinetic energy @xmath82 , we obtain the spectrum @xmath77 in equation  ( [ eq : eq_q_genform ] ) @xmath83 where @xmath82 and @xmath84 are the kinetic energy and mass of the particle , respectively . in the present section",
    "we take @xmath85 , the mass of proton .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath86 and the spectral index @xmath80 of equation  ( [ eq : q_pwlaw ] ) can be estimated from the gamma - ray data .",
    "their values should be adjusted to fit the observed gamma - ray spectrum . with these parameters",
    "one can estimate the intensity of hard x - rays and radio emission .",
    "radio emission depends strongly on the magnetic field strength whose value has not been well established .",
    "hence radio emission can not be considered as a strong indicator for the validity of the model .",
    "the same is true for the ionization rate whose value is known only up to an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , we consider that these two observations play a supplementary role in our discussion , and we mainly concentrate on hard x - ray emission to examine whether the model is compatible with observations or not .      in the framework of this model , we assume that the injection happened some time ago in the form of a short burst .",
    "the temporal term of the injection function in equation  ( [ eq : eq_q_genform ] ) is expressed as @xmath87 .",
    "the observed spectrum of @xcite can be reproduced by assuming @xmath88 in equation  ( [ eq : q_pwlaw ] ) , and @xmath89 for the 3fgl data @xcite ( see the left panel of figure  [ fig : hadronic ] ) .",
    "as one can see from the figure the fit of the data is not very good .",
    "it was indicated by @xcite that the low - energy part of the spectrum can not be explained in the framework of pure hadronic model , and the situation is worse in the case of 3fgl data .",
    "gamma - ray spectrum depends weakly on time @xmath90 and the diffusion coefficients .",
    "however the intensity of hard x - ray emission is more sensitive to these parameters .",
    "its value increases as the diffusion coefficients decrease . to maximize the intensity of x - rays we used the following propagation parameters : inside the cloud @xmath91 @xmath42 s@xmath14 while outside the cloud @xmath92",
    "@xmath42 s@xmath14 ( see equation  [ eq : diffusion_gen ] ) . the evolution of the hard x - ray intensity with time is presented in the right panel of figure  [ fig : hadronic ] .         except for the case of continuous supply hadronic model .",

    "although the curves in right panel of figure  [ fig : hadronic ] show a tendency to increase with time , an unreasonably long time and unreasonably high energy of the initial burst are needed to reach the observed value .",
    "therefore , we conclude that single - burst hadronic model is unable to reproduce the observed hard x - ray emission from the gc . however , relativistic protons may produce a non - negligible contribution to the gamma - ray emission .    the total energy budget to produce gamma - ray emission depends on how long ago the injection of protons took place .",
    "since protons escape from the region with dense gas , the longer the time from the injection , the higher the energy is required . for characteristic time about @xmath94 yrs , the total energy required is within @xmath95 erg .",
    "one can see that a single supernova explosion can supply enough energy assuming 10% acceleration efficiency .      in this case",
    "the temporal term of the injection function in equation  ( [ eq : eq_q_genform ] ) is expressed as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the heaviside step function .",

    "both gamma - ray and x - ray results do not differ strongly from that of the single - burst hadronic model except that the x - ray emission is even lower .",
    "therefore , the conclusion is not in favor of continuous supply ( or stationary ) model also .",
    "in this section we assume that the central source injects relativistic electrons .",
    "the source function of electrons in equation  ( [ eq : kin_eq_p ] ) is similar to that used in section  [ sec : hadronic ] ( see equation  ( [ eq : eq_q_genform ] ) ) , @xmath99 where the energy part @xmath77 is described by equation  ( [ eq : q_pwlaw ] ) with @xmath100 , the electron mass .",

    "similar to section  [ sec : sbhm ] , the temporal term of the injection function in equation  ( [ eq : eq_q_genform_e ] ) is expressed as @xmath87 .    for the observed gamma - ray spectrum of @xcite , in order to reproduce the cut - off in the data at about 2 gev",

    "x - ray and gamma - ray emission consists of bremsstrahlung and inverse - compton components .",
    "the energy losses through inverse - compton effect produces a softer spectrum in x - rays than by bremsstrahlung .",
    "therefore , for the same intensity of gamma - ray emission one would expect higher intensity of x - rays if inverse - compton effect dominates .",
    "thus , in order to maximize the intensity of x - rays ( with a given gamma - ray intensity ) , it is necessary to reduce the bremsstrahlung component of the emission as much as possible . to achieve this effect ,",

    "for spectra with cut - off at @xmath112 mev , 10 mev , 30 mev and 100 mev , the value of ionization rate in the central cavity becomes 1.0 , 0.45 , 0.12 , 0.03 of the original value .",
    "the corresponding values of ionization rate averaged over cnd are 1.0 , 0.75 , 0.4 , 0.16 of the original value and they are very close to the corresponding modifications of the x - ray flux",
    ". therefore ionization rate in the central cavity can be slightly reduced by an adjustment of the spectral shape .",
    "on the other hand the value of ionization rate averaged over cnd is tied to the intensity of the hard x - rays and there are not much freedom . in any case , as we mentioned before the measured ionization rate is uncertain up to an order of magnitude in values and can not be considered as a very reliable restriction .",
    "another important indicator related to ionization is the intensity of 6.4 kev k@xmath80 line of neutral iron . for solar abundance of iron",

    "it is worth noting that if we consider the whole region of interest , then the expected equivalent width of this line will be about 15 ev .",

    "average ionization rate inside the cnd is about @xmath127 s@xmath14 and does not differ significantly from the experimental value .    the reason for the very high ionization rate in the central area originate from the characteristic of the source of particles there . indeed",

    "another way to reduce the ionization rate is to assume that injected spectrum has a spectral break at low energies . despite the fact that such modification does not affect the average particle distribution at large distances where it is modified by energy losses",

    "it is worth noting that proton - to - electron ratio deduced here is much higher than the one deduced from direct comparison of energy budgets from sections  [ sec : hadronic ] and [ sec : leptonic ] .",

    "if for some reason the density of ir photons is an order of magnitude higher than what we have estimated , the expected x - ray flux could be comparable with observations .",
    "despite we do not know what kind of sources may increase ir photon density by an order of magnitude , such a high density could be justified if the cut - off in the tev spectrum of the central source is indeed due to absorption of the ir photons . moreover",
