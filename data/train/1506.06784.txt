    "fusing human and machine capabilities has been an active research topic in computer science for decades . in robotics related applications ,",
    "this line of research is often referred to as _ shared autonomy_. while shared autonomy has been addressed _ in toto _ , it can be broken down into more specialized areas of research .",
    "in particular , some researchers focus on the fusing of human and machine `` perception '' ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , a great deal of research has focused on fusing human and machine `` decision making '' in the machine learning @xcite , control theory  @xcite , and human robot interaction communities  @xcite .    under the umbrella of shared decision making , an even more focussed line of research",
    "has emerged : shared control , whereby the moment to moment control commands sent to the platform motors are a synthesis of human input and autonomy input . broadly speaking , shared control has been deployed in two cases : shared teleoperation ( where the human operator is not co - located with the robot ) and onboard shared control ( where the human operator is physically on the robot ) .",
    "shared teleoperation is used for numerous applications : search and rescue  @xcite and extraterrestrial robotics  @xcite are two examples .",
    "onboard shared control has likewise enjoyed a wide variety of use cases : assistive wheelchair technology  @xcite , assistive automobile driving , and assistive manufacturing vehicle operation ( e.g. , forklifts ) are just a few of the examples . for any of these cases , shared control can be broken down into an autonomous modeling step , a human modeling step , and a human - machine arbitration step ( see @xcite for a compelling argument justifying this classification scheme ) .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the probabilistic foundations of onboard shared control in the presence of dynamic obstacles ( `` the crowd '' ) : figure  [ fig : shared - autonomy - diagram ] depicts our approach . in order to do this",
    ", we formulate shared control as a random process and describe the joint distribution ( over the random operator , autonomy , and crowd functions ) that governs behavior and then propose a tractable model captures notions of operator - autonomy agreeability , safety , and efficiency ; further , we prove that linear blending is a special case of this approach .",
    "in the course of the proof , we observe the following : first , in linear blending , the autonomy reasons _ independently _ of the operator during optimization , so even if we had a precise operator model , the autonomy would not be informed of this information until after the optimization .",
    "second , in linear blending , the autonomy is limited to a single optimal decision , which is then averaged with the operator input  this approach leaves no flexibility in how the autonomy might assist the user .",
    "next , we present an extension of linear blending that can accommodate more than one statistic about the user ( e.g. , user inferred goal information , preferred trajectories , etc ) , and find that state of the art approaches to this problem are prone to statistical inconsistency .",
    "we thus present a statistically valid model for how to properly condition the autonomy on user statistics .",
    "we conclude with a section on the optimality ( with respect to agreeability , safety , and efficiency ) of linear blending and our probabilistic approach .",
    "we begin by defining the arbitration step of linear blending : @xmath0 where , at time @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the linearly blended shared control command sent to the platform actuators , @xmath3 is the human operator input ( joystick deflections , keyboard inputs , etc . ) , @xmath4 is the next autonomy command , and @xmath5 are the operator and autonomy _ arbitration functions _ , respectively . to ensure that the magnitude of @xmath2 does not exceed the magnitude of @xmath3 or @xmath4",
    ", we require that @xmath6 we observe that since @xmath7 , there is only one free parameter in this formulation .",
    "this linear arbitration model has enjoyed wide adoption in the assistive wheelchair community ( @xcite ) .",
    "outside of the wheelchair community , shared control path planning researchers have widely adopted equation  [ eq : lin - blend ] as a _ de - facto _ standard protocol , as extensively argued in @xcite ( in  @xcite , it is argued that `` linear policy blending can act as a common lens across a wide range of literature '' ) .",
    "additionally , the work of @xcite advocates the broad adoption of a linear arbitration step for shared control .    for the purposes of this article",
    ", we describe how each quantity of equation  [ eq : lin - blend ] is computed :    \\1 ) collect the data at time @xmath1 : @xmath8 are the historical operator inputs .",
    "@xmath9 are the historical measurements of the state of the robot ( such as odometry , localization , slam output , etc ) .",
    "\\2 ) compute the _ autonomous _ input @xmath4 : this quantity may be computed using nearly any off the shelf planning algorithm , and is dependent on application . the `` dynamic window approach '' @xcite and `` vector field histograms@xmath10 '' @xcite",
    "are popular approaches to perform obstacle avoidance for wheelchairs .",
    "sometimes , the autonomy is biased according to data about the operator  for instance , one might imagine an offline training phase where the robot is taught `` how '' to move through the space , and then this data could be agglomerated using , e.g. , inverse optimal control .",
    "alternatively , one might bias the autonomous decision making by conditioning the planner on the predicted or known human goal .",
    "\\3 ) compute the arbitration parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "a wide variety of heuristics have been adopted to compute this parameter : confidence in robot trajectory , smoothness , mitigating jerk , operator reliability , user desired trajectories , safeguarding against unsafe trajectories , etc .",
    "indeed , much of the shared control literature is devoted to developing novel heuristics to compute this parameter .",
    "\\4 ) compute the shared control @xmath2 using equation  [ eq : lin - blend ] .    typically , the data @xmath8 are interpreted literally  no likelihood or predictive model filters this data stream . in other approaches ,",
    "operator intention is modeled using a combination of dynamic bayesian networks or gaussian mixture models .    for this paper",
    ", we adopt the notation @xmath13 ( that is , we treat operator inputs as _",
    "measurements _ of the operator _ trajectory _ , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the action space ) .",
    "similarly , we define measurements @xmath9 of the robot trajectory @xmath16 and measurements @xmath17 of the @xmath18th static or dynamic obstacle trajectory @xmath19 .",
    "we thus work in the space of distributions over the operator function @xmath20 , autonomy function @xmath16 , and crowd function @xmath21 , measured through @xmath22 .",
    "the integer @xmath23 is the number of people in the crowd at time @xmath1 .",
    "we comment on the work of  @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the authors construct a probabilistic model over user forward trajectories ( i.e. , a specific and personalized instantiation of @xmath24 ) .",
    "they then formulate shared control as a _ partially observable markov decision process _ ( pomdp ) , in order to capture the effects of robot actions on the probabilistic model of the operator .",
    "however , for tractability of the pomdp , the autonomy is limited to only choosing from the next available state  this makes assistive navigation through crowds impossible ( as shown in  @xcite ) .",
    "further , the potential autonomous actions are limited by the input device ; in one application , the autonomy was only able to reason over 9 directions . as we discuss in section  [ sec : operator - autonomy - disagreement ] , limiting the autonomy to such a degree can negatively impact performance .",
    "as stated in section  [ sec : introduction ] , we seek to explore the probabilistic foundations of assistive onboard shared control ; we thus posit @xmath25 that is , probabilistic shared control ( psc ) is the _ maximum a - posteriori _ ( map ) value of the joint distribution over the operator , autonomy , and crowd .",
    "we suggest this approach partly based on what we have learned from fully autonomous navigation in human crowds  @xcite  that the _ interaction _ model between the robot and the human is the most important quantity  and partly based on the following : by formulating shared control as the map value of a joint probability distribution , we can explore the modeling limitations imposed by linear blending and the performance consequences of these limitations .    in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we explain how the approach in equation  [ eq : probabilistic - shared - control ] is a natural extension of our previous work in  @xcite , and present a tractable model of the joint distribution over the operator , autonomy , and crowd .",
    "the probabilistic graphical model in figure  [ fig : pgm ] guides our derivation .",
    "a cooperative human crowd navigation model ( as in  @xcite ) is described by @xmath26 where @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 are the robot and crowd individual dynamical prediction functions , respectively .",
    "the robot - crowd interaction function @xmath29 captures joint collision avoidance : that is , how the robot and the crowd cooperatively move around one another so that the other can pass .",
    "the graphical model is presented on the left hand side of figure  [ fig : pgm ] .",
    "( left hand side of figure ) and probabilistic shared control in equation  [ eq : obstacles ] . ]    a probabilistic shared control ( psc ) model in the presence of static or dynamic obstacles is @xmath30 where @xmath24 is the predictive distribution over the operator , @xmath31 is data generated by the operator , and @xmath32 is the interaction function between the operator and the robot . in analogy with  @xcite ,",
    "the interaction function @xmath32 intends to capture how `` agreeable '' the robot trajectory is with the desires of the operator . in this article ,",
    "we choose @xmath33 where @xmath34 captures how tightly the autonomy must couple to the operator ; it is important to point out that many other reasonable functions could be used here . importantly ,",
    "as shown in theorem  [ thrm : psc - gen - lb ] , this is the ( implicit ) operator - robot interaction function of linear blending .",
    "the graphical model is presented on the right hand side of figure  [ fig : pgm ] .",
    "the model in equation  [ eq : obstacles ] can be understood in the following way : the autonomy ( modeled with @xmath35 ) optimizes over safety and efficiency in crowds  specifically , the robot - crowd interaction function @xmath29 models how to move _ through _ a crowd in the safest and most efficient way . similarly , the function @xmath36 models how `` agreeable '' the robot path @xmath16 is to the operator path @xmath20 . by formulating @xmath20 and @xmath16 as random functions , flexibility of both parties",
    "is modeled , thus enabling a more realistic arbitration ( where both parties are willing to compromise ) .",
    "this idea was captured in  @xcite : the robot and the crowd were treated as random functions so that they could come to a compromise about how to ( cooperatively ) pass by one another .",
    "thus , by choosing the joint @xmath37 as in equation  [ eq : probabilistic - shared - control ] , we _ simultaneously _ optimize over three quantities : agreeability , safety , and efficiency .",
    "we suggest that such a joint optimization over safety and efficiency ( the domain of the autonomy ) and agreeability ( adhering to the desires of the operator ) is a reasonable way to formulate shared control .",
    "our analysis in the following sections provides credibility to this presumption .",
    "to understand linear blending as a special case of equation  [ eq : probabilistic - shared - control ] , we consider the following conditioning relationship : @xmath38 to understand how the linear blending modeling assumptions effect the full joint , we first insert the linear blending _ operator _",
    "model : @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath40 in this case , @xmath41 because this distribution is already conditioned on @xmath42 , there is no need for a linear arbitration step ( we prove this in theorem  [ thrm : psc - gen - lb ] ) .",
    "further , by fixing the operator at @xmath42 , we are no longer _",
    "jointly _ optimizing over the autonomy and the operator .",
    "[ thrm : psc - gen - lb ] let @xmath43 and use laplace s approximation  @xcite to approximate @xmath35 , where @xmath44 is a mode of the distribution : @xmath45 then @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath34 is the operator - autonomy attraction parameter .",
    "we compute @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50    to make the correspondence with linear blending explicit , we choose @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "then @xmath53 we recall that @xmath54 and so the mixing of @xmath55 and @xmath34 is expected .",
    "only one free parameter exists in linear blending .",
    "we now examine the how the assumptions of linear blending can effect performance .",
    "the linear blending restriction of the robot - crowd distribution to a unimodal gaussian during arbitration @xmath56 can lead to severe restrictions in shared control capability ; even though a locally optimal autonomy strategy @xmath57 is included in the linear blend @xmath58 , there is no guarantee that the human operator will choose this optima , or even a nearby optimum ( see section  [ sec : operator - autonomy - disagreement ] ) . alternatively , by maintaining the multitude of hypotheses inherent to @xmath35 , we greatly increase the possibility that the autonomy will be able to assist the operator in a way that is both desirable and safe . as an example , linear trajectory blending over a _",
    "safe _ operator input and a _ safe _ autonomous input can result in an unsafe shared trajectory .",
    "that is , the weighted average of two safe trajectories can be averaged into an unsafe trajectory .",
    "in this section , we extend our definition of linear blending to capture the salient characteristics of recent approaches such as  @xcite . broadly speaking",
    ", this line of work seeks to include additional data about the operator _ before _ arbitration .",
    "we show that this is statistically unfounded , and thus introduce a method ( conditional trajectory blending ) that incorporates operator information in a statistically principled way .",

    "we might drive @xmath75 towards solutions more closely aligned with user desire .    while this approach is _ sensible _ , no _ principles _ motivate such an extension .",
