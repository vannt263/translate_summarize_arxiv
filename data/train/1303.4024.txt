    "the calculated @xmath97 is monotonically decreasing versus @xmath52 ( the separation of the twin boundaries ) until it plateaus at the measured twin boundary energy ; essentially , the defects interact ( costing energy ) until separated enough that they are screened from one another .",

    "while the twins dictate the magnetic correlation length , we suggest that small , low - energy excitation can further depress average moments by spatial and temporal averaging , beyond those due to dynamic fluctuations .",
    "nanotwins ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) with no local distortion are like an isolated , ideal defect pair , not a dense set of twins . to understand the effect of short - ranged structural distortion , we have studied a @xmath46-@xmath113 ideal twin with(out ) relaxation in @xmath114-plane for only those atoms near the boundary , more localized than in the nanotwin supercell .",

    "relaxations along @xmath41- and @xmath42-axis lie within @xmath117% of ideal , close to the best fit to measured pdf,@xcite so the twin and nanotwin are very similar in energy and local structure . unlike for ideal twins , the nanotwin surface energy decreases to its limiting value as the nanotwin - nanotwin distance grows ( table [ table1 ] ) , and it is much lower in energy than extended twins .",

    "for the bulk ( hs ) states , the major contribution at fermi energy e@xmath119 arises from fe @xmath120 and @xmath121 , also evidenced from arpes.@xcite all the other orbital components exhibit a pseudo - gap near e@xmath122 . for ls - fe compared to hs - fe , all the projected dos are shifted towards e@xmath122 .",
    "the most pronounced effect occurs for @xmath120 and @xmath121 character , where majority states for ls fall into a pseudogap for @xmath120 but are peaked for @xmath121 .",
    "although the change of these orbital states is dominated by in - plane fe - spin configurations , small contributions also arise from the hybridization with as @xmath123 and @xmath124 orbitals ( out of the fe - plane ) , eventually altering the fs .",
    "the large difference in the near e@xmath122 ( majority ) dos between the hs and ls state points to the orbital dependent electronic origin for quenched moments .",

    "<S> in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , structural and magnetic planar defects begin to proliferate below the structural phase transition , affecting descriptions of magnetism and superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we study using density - functional theory the stability and magnetic properties of competing antiphase and domain boundaries , twins and isolated @xmath1twins ( twin nuclei ) - spin excitations proposed and/or observed . </S>",
    "<S> these nanoscale defects have very low surface energy ( @xmath2-@xmath3  @xmath4jm@xmath5 ) , with twins favorable to the mesoscale . </S>",
    "<S> defects exhibit smaller moments confined near their boundaries  making a uniform - moment picture inappropriate for long - range magnetic order in real samples . </S>",
    "<S> _ nano_twins explain features in measured pair distribution functions , so should be considered when analyzing scattering data . </S>",
    "<S> all these defects can be weakly mobile and/or have fluctuations that lower assessed `` ordered '' moments from longer spatial and/or time averaging , and should be considered directly . </S>"
