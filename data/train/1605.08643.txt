    "the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) has been extensively investigated at various levels of theory including quantum monte - carlo methods .",
    "it serves well the purpose of studying the quality of less computationally demanding approximations , such as the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "finite order many - body perturbation theory is useless for metallic systems , such as the heg , since each order beyond the first one contains diverging diagrams .",
    "however , ring diagrams , such as that shown on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : direct ] , can be summed to infinite order before summing over all momenta occurring in the diagrams .",
    "macke @xcite was the first who performed that renormalization and calculated what was later termed random phase approximation .",
    "the @xmath0 divergence of a ring diagram in @xmath1-th order is the strongest divergence possible in that order , making the rpa ring diagrams the dominant contribution to the correlation energy at long distances or , equivalently , at high densities , meaning that the rpa becomes exact in the limit of infinite density .",
    "all the characteristic quantities of the heg , such as the correlation energy @xmath2 , depend on @xmath3 , which is the radius of a sphere , containing on average just one electron .",
    "particle number fluctutations beyond that follow from the pair - correlation functions ( pcf ) @xmath4 as functions of @xmath5 and ( parametrically ) of @xmath3 for electron pairs with antiparallel ( a ) and parallel ( p ) spins @xcite .",
    "the limiting case @xmath6 corresponds to the ideal fermi gas .",
    "the above mentioned failure of many - body perturbation theory makes the function @xmath7 singular at @xmath6 with @xmath8 .",
    "whereas the coulomb hole @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , arises only through the coulomb repulsion , the larger fermi hole @xmath11 comes from the combined action of the pauli principle and the coulomb repulsion .",
    "equivalent information is provided by the static structure factors ( sfs ) @xmath12 , which are obtained by a fourier transform of @xmath13 @xcite . an analysis in terms of feynman diagrams shows , that @xmath14 , whereas @xmath15 splits according to @xmath16 into a hartree - fock ( hf ) like part @xmath17 reducible to @xmath18 and a cumulant non - reducible remainder @xmath19 @xcite , which again splits according to @xmath20 into the direct part @xmath21 and the corresponding exchange part @xmath22 .",
    "thus for @xmath23 it is @xmath24 .",
    "these splittings have been derived in @xcite from the 2-body reduced density matrix and its linked - diagram representations . here",
    ", the same splitting follows automatically from the linked - diagrams of @xmath25 and the generalized hellmann - feynman theorem .    at the level of the rpa",

    "it was extended to the static quantities @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite , to the dynamic quantities @xmath27 , and also to the 2-body reduced density matrix @xcite .",
