    "for a quantum system in a pure state , localization refers to dynamical variables and operators like position , momentum , energy and angular momentum which have classical equivalents .",
    "it is helpful to picture the localization in classical phase space .",
    "there are many phase space representations of quantum systems , such as the wigner distribution , but these are not necessary to obtain a classical picture of the phase space localization of a quantum system . for that , it is only necessary to consider the expectations and variances of quantum dynamical variables , and then to picture these expectations and variances _ as if _ they represented the expectations and variances of classical quantities .",
    "the general theory of localization is treated in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger evolution of a system usually produces _",
    "de_localization or dispersion .",
    "the interaction of the system with its environment , by contrast , produces localization .",
    "it is convenient to consider these competing processes separately before considering them together .",
    "the dispersion is well - known , since it occurs in isolated systems .",
    "the opposite extreme is an open system which interacts with environment so strongly that the schrdinger evolution can be neglected .",
    "this is a _ wide open _ system , and the theory of localization for these systems has been treated in detail in @xcite .    for simple systems , earlier papers",
    "@xcite had built up a picture in which interaction with the environment produced localization , sometimes to an eigenstate of an operator corresponding to a surface in phase space , but more commonly to a state which is localized to a wave packet in phase space whose heisenberg indeterminacy products are of the order of @xmath34 . in @xcite",
    "that picture was confirmed and extended .",
    "a general theory was presented , lower bounds were put on rates of self - localization , and bounds were put on asymptotic states .    for a pure state @xmath14 , the expectation of a selfadjoint operator @xmath13 is denoted @xmath35 and the variance of the operator @xmath13 is @xmath36 the localization @xmath37 is defined as the inverse of the mean of the variance for the ensemble : @xmath38 the simplest theorem is for a wide open system in which there is only one self - adjoint lindblad operator @xmath29 in the state diffusion equation . it is shown that the rate of localization of @xmath29 is at least as fast as 2 ( @xcite , section [ secloc ] ) : @xmath39 because lindblad operators have dimension @xmath40 , the rate is dimensionless .",
    "this localization is towards a _ surface _ in phase space defined by the dynamical variable @xmath41 , and is characteristic of interaction with apparatus that measures @xmath41 .",
    "more general and more interesting is the case where there are at least @xmath42 operators , where @xmath4 is the number of freedoms , and the surfaces for the corresponding dynamical variables define points in phase space . in that case",
    "at least @xmath4 pairs of operators will not commute .",
    "the simplest example is a one freedom system with two conjugate variables @xmath43 whose operators satisfy @xmath44 = i\\hbar.\\ ] ] in this case it is shown that the state localizes and asymptotically approaches a wave packet with minimum heisenberg indeterminacy product .",
    "it is also shown that operators that are not selfadjoint , such as annihilation and creation operators , can localize to wave packets . in the more realistic examples that we study numerically in the following section",
    ", the localization has to compete with the dispersion due to the schrdinger evolution , the wave packet is more dispersed , and its dispersion often varies considerably as a function of time .    for general open systems",
    "there is a physical competition between the dispersion due to the hamiltonian and the localization due to the state diffusion .",
    "there is no general theory for this , but there are many numerical examples of localization , such as @xcite for the forced damped oscillator and @xcite for localization in one well of a double well , and phase space localization by position localization and hamiltonian coupling of position and momentum .",
    "halliwell and zoupas @xcite have provided a general theory for the evolution of gaussian wave packets for an important model , generalizing a result of disi @xcite .",
    "from the theorems and the numerical examples it would appear that the localization of wave packets to relatively small regions of phase space is the norm , so that the limiting behaviour on a classical scale is the direct representation of classical states as points in phase space , rather than the more abstract surfaces defined by action functions that satisfy the hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "for our purposes the most important consequence of the localization of quantum trajectories around phase space trajectories is , that by continually changing the basis , it is often possible to reduce the number of basis states needed to represent the wave packet by many orders of magnitude .",
    "if a wave packet is localized about a point @xmath6 in phase space far from the origin , it requires a great many of the usual number states @xmath45 to represent it .",
    "but fewer _ excited coherent _ basis states @xmath46 , are needed , with corresponding savings in computer storage space and computation time .",
    "these states are defined using the coherent state displacement operator , @xmath47 the separation of the representation into a classical part @xmath6 and a quantum part @xmath48 is called the _ moving basis _ , or , as in @xcite , the _",
    "mixed _ representation .    in this basis , the usual creation and annihilation operators are modified : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the local annihilation operator ( with @xmath6 as the origin ) and @xmath51 is the identity operator .",
    "the effect of the local operators on the excited coherent states is given by : @xmath52 similarly , @xmath53 where @xmath54    care must be taken to avoid ambiguity in the external phase factors .",
    "normally , different displacement operators do not commute ; nor is the product of two displacement operators a standard displacement operator . in both cases there",
    "is an additional phase factor : @xmath55 in order to retain an unambiguous relation to the standard fixed basis states , this additional phase factor must be removed .",
    "fortunately this is simple , as it the same for all the moving basis states .",
    "the numerical algorithm follows directly .",
    "as the integration proceeds , the phase point expectation @xmath56 drifts away from zero .",
    "the basis is then shifted , @xmath57 and the classical phase point @xmath6 adjusted : @xmath58 the time between basis adjustments can be optimized in various ways , depending on the problem , the degree of localization , and the difficulty of carrying out the basis change .    in principle",
    "there is another way to make the basis change . if the phase space point @xmath59 and state @xmath60 _ relative to _ ( q , p ) _ as origin _",
    "are used to define the state , then we can include the change of basis in the evolution equation for @xmath60 .",
    "this leads to a set of simultaneous differential equations in @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath60 ; in integrating these equations , both the qsd evolution and the basis shift are done automatically .",
    "this _ simultaneous moving basis _",
    "method is attractive for a number of reasons ; the states always remain in an optimally ` localized ' basis , and therefore can take the best advantage of the qsd localization effects to minimize the number of necessary basis states .",
    "there is no need for an additional step for the basis change . in practice",
    ", the simultaneous moving basis method results in a considerable increase in programming complexity , and may have numerical stability problems . as yet the method",
    "has not proved itself sufficiently , so we have not used it .",
    "implementing the moving basis algorithm on a computer is straightforward .",
    "each set of normalized flucutations @xmath26 determines a quantum trajectory through eq .",
    "( [ eqqsd ] ) , which can be simulated using discrete time steps @xmath63 , using a runge - kutta algorithm for the deterministic part , and an euler method for the stochastic part ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "suppose that at time @xmath64 the state @xmath65 is represented in the basis @xmath66 , centered at @xmath67 then after one discrete time step , the expectations in this basis shift to @xmath68    the computational advantage of a small number of basis states is then retained by changing the representation to the shifted basis @xmath69 centered at @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this shift in the origin of the basis represents the elementary single step of the moving basis of mqsd .",
    "the components of @xmath72 can be computed using the expressions given above . the computing time",
    "needed for the basis shift is of the same order of magnitude as for computing a single discrete timestep of eq .",
    "( [ eqqsd ] ) . shifting the basis once every discrete timestep could therefore double the computing time , depending on the complexity of the hamiltonian and the number of degrees of freedom . on the other hand",
    ", the reduced number of basis vectors needed to represent states in the moving basis can lead to savings far bigger than a factor of 2 .    in one example of second harmonic generation described in the following section , two modes of the electromagnetic field interact .",
    "using the moving basis reduces the number of basis vectors needed by a factor of 100 in each mode . the total number of basis vectors needed is thus reduced by a factor of 10000 , leading to reduction in computing time by a factor of @xmath73 .",
    "futhermore , the fixed basis would exceed the memory capacity of most existing computers .",
    "the qsd equation  ( [ eqqsd ] ) can contain both localizing and delocalizing terms .",
    "nonlinear terms in the hamiltonian tend to spread the wave function in phase space , whereas the lindblad terms localize .",
    "accordingly , the width of the wave packets varies along a typical trajectory .",
    "we use this to reduce the computing time even further by dynamically adjusting the number of basis vectors .",
    "our criterion for this adjustment depends on parameters @xmath74 , the _ cutoff probability _ , and @xmath75 , the _ pad size _ , which represents the number of boundary basis states that are checked for significant probability .",
    "we require the total probability of the top @xmath75 states to be no greater than @xmath76 , increasing and decreasing the number of states actually used accordingly , as the integration procedes along the quantum trajectory .",
    "the quantum mechanics of systems whose classical limit exhibits dissipative chaos is an interesting problem .",
    "dissipation is relatively difficult to treat in quantum mechanics .",
    "the best of the commonly used techniques is the solution of the master equation , but as we have pointed out , solving the master equation numerically can be an extremely difficult problem . perhaps because of this , quantum dissipative chaos has been neglected by comparison with quantum hamiltonian chaos .",

    ", it is relatively simple to calculate the evolution of this system far from the classical limit , for example when @xmath80 .",
    "but it is more important to study the classical limit of quantum chaos , to see how the relatively well understood properties of classical chaos appear in quantum systems .",
    "this limit is conveniently represented by decreasing @xmath34 , which increases the number of fixed basis states required . with @xmath80 ,",
    "about 10 states are needed to simulate the system with accuracy . on approaching the classical limit",
    ", the number of states quickly becomes impractical . in a semiclassical regime with @xmath81 ,",
    "more than 10,000 states are needed ; the density operator method would require storage and computation with a prohibitive @xmath82 real numbers .",
    "this , like most nonlinear problems , is exacerbated by the fact that the potential needs much more computation than , for example , the simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "using mqsd , however , this problem becomes tractable . in a chaotic system ,",
    "the delocalizing forces are particularly strong in the neighbourhood of hyperbolic fixed points , where the dynamics spreads the wave packet in phase space",
    ". however , the localizing effects of the environment always predominate .",
    "mqsd picks out a good local time - dependent basis , and the method rarely requires more than twenty states , usually about ten , just as in the small scale quantum limit .",
    "this is easy to see by examining figure [ figduff ] .",
    "our second example is frequency doubling or second harmonic generation , which is a standard process in quantum optics .",
    "the system consists of two optical modes of frequency @xmath83 and @xmath84 which interact in a cavity driven by a coherent external field with frequency @xmath85 and amplitude @xmath4 .",
    "the cavity modes are slightly damped and detuned , with detuning parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "the master equation for this problem first appeared in @xcite .",
    "a direct numerical solution of the master equation for this problem is difficult because , in the fock basis , the dimension of the effective hilbert space is equal to the product of the photon number cutoffs in both modes and easily becomes very large . the problem becomes intractable even for moderate numbers of photons in each mode .",
    "earlier treatments of this problem include @xcite .",
    "the qsd method was employed for studying second harmonic generation by gisin and percival @xcite and goetsch and graham @xcite .",
    "both used a fixed fock - state basis , and rather limited photon numbers .",
    "gisin and percival @xcite improved the method slightly by using a lower as well as an upper cutoff .",
    "more recently , zheng and savage @xcite applied the quantum jump method to the chaotic regime @xcite of second - harmonic generation for large photon numbers . using hundreds of hours on a 32-processor supercomputer , they succeed in simulating cases where the expectation of the photon number is of the order of 200 in each mode .",
    "their fock basis has 512 basis states in each mode , i.e. , a total of 250000 basis states , a _ tour - de - force _ near the limits of their method .    to illustrate the power of mqsd , we have computed trajectories for second harmonic generation with parameters similar to the ones used by zheng and savage @xcite , but leading to photon numbers on average six times as large . for this problem ,",
    "zheng and savage would have needed approximately @xmath95 basis states . using the moving basis with an adaptive basis size , we computed a single trajectory in a few hours on a pc .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ figshg ] were obtained using a cutoff probability @xmath96 . the total number of basis states needed in the simulation varied between approximately 50 and 1000 .",
    "changing the cutoff probability to @xmath97 lowered the number of basis states needed to between approximately 40 and 200 , clearly a strong dependence on @xmath76 .",
    "surprisingly , the choice of cutoff probability affected the simulated expectation values only very slightly .",
    "it is interesting to compare estimates of computation space and time of a single mqsd run for an open sytems and the numerical solution of the schrdinger equation for the same system isolated from its environment .",
    "the former has diffusion and drift terms that increase the computation time for a single step of integration , but the localization reduces significantly the size of the basis needed for computation . the latter has fewer terms in the equation , but the schrdinger dispersion increases the number of states needed for the representation .",
    "clearly , for systems with more than one degree of freedom the advantage of mqsd is even greater , the savings in number of states going like the power of the number of freedoms .",

    "when measurement is not the main interaction with an environment , then qsd is often more efficient .",
    "examples are the types of thermal interaction that are often represented by heat baths , interactions with a radiation field , and also continuous interactions with condensed matter or gaseous environments that are not to be considered as part of the system , as in line broadening , molecular dynamics , noise in quantum circuits , etc . in these cases",
    "it is often simplest to use qsd with a fixed basis , and this is likely to be more efficient numerically than jumps .    where the interaction with the environment is sufficiently strong to produce strong localization during a significant part of the evolution , then mqsd is to be preferred .",
    "this is a very common situation , as the greater the environmental interaction , the greater the localization becomes .",
    "mqsd is feasible where there are several degrees of freedom , and there would be no hope of using other simulation methods . in some limiting cases",
    "semiclassical methods can be used instead .",
    "mqsd is likely to be valuable in the those situations that lie between those that are sufficiently simple to be simulated by other numerical means , and those for which a semiclassical method can be used .",
    "monte carlo trajectory methods for open systems have been developed largely in connection with quantum optics , but they have been extended using qsd and mqsd to particles in traps @xcite , while spiller and his collaborators @xcite have carried out some interesting qsd studies of quantum circuit elements with a view to applications to josephson junctions .    however , the potential range of useful applications is far greater .",
    "in particular there has been no application to quantum effects in the dynamics of molecules which interact strongly with gases or with liquids . for isolated molecules , there are often transitions between many potential energy surfaces , and no clear way of localizing the molecule on one surface out of many .",
    "but in qsd , the interaction with the enviroment localizes the molecule into a small region around a phase point on one many possible surfaces , so that mqsd for a molecule interacting with its environment would have considerable advantages over the numerical solution of the schrdinger equation for an isolated molecule .",
    "it is also clear that the noise in quantum circuits is an environmental effect that could well be simulated by mqsd .",
    "this applies even more strongly to quantum computation , where the potentially rapid decoherence produced by thermal interaction could be a crucial limitation . in these cases a lot could be learned from individual mqsd runs , without the need to make the large number of simulations required to get good statistics .",
    "it is not even clear that the density operator is of much relevance to such applications , for which the individual system is all - important .",
