    "any caltech theory student in the late 1960 s , particularly if murray gell - mann was their supervisor , had to be good at distinguishing various `` quark models '' .",
    "were we talking about `` constituent '' or `` current '' quarks , and within those categories , was model dependence an issue ?",
    "quarks were somehow fundamental , but it was not even clear that their dynamics should be governed by a local field theory .",
    "the main tactic was to `` abstract '' rules which seemed to be model independent and led to physical consequences which could be compared with existing data .    by that time",
    ", the quark idea was several years old , dating from work completed independently by the end of 1963 : gell - mann s quarks,@xcite zweig s aces,@xcite and ( a reference i have just heard of ) petermann s `` spineurs ( avec )  des valeurs non entires de la charge''.@xcite these papers had in common    1 .",
    "structures @xmath0 for mesons and @xmath1 for baryons built from non - relativistic _ constituent _ quarks @xmath2 and anti - quarks @xmath3 , [ structure ] 2 .",
    "the idea that @xmath4 mass formulas @xcite are due to the strange quark @xmath5 being heavier than the up and down quarks @xmath6 , and 3 .   concerns about whether the fractional charges would be observable .",
    "gell - mann and zweig were led to ( [ structure ] ) by the need to explain the absence of exotic @xmath4 multiplets in the eightfold way @xcite .",
    "zweig analyzed the constituent quark model in detail , deriving properties such as spins , parities and masses for various @xmath4 multiplets .",
    "gell - mann had a separate aim : to reproduce current algebra , a set of equal - time commutators for @xmath7 currents@xcite which he had previously managed to abstract without using quarks .",
    "for this , he needed _",
    "current quarks _ ,",
    "i.e.   relativistic fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 for each flavor @xmath10 , from which electromagnetic , weak and other @xmath7 currents could be constructed .    immediately , there were concerns about constituent quark statistics .",
    "how can a baryon like @xmath11 exist as an @xmath12-wave spin - flavor symmetric state @xmath13@xmath14@xmath14@xmath15 if quarks",
    "are spin-@xmath16 fermions ?",
    "it is hard to imagine ground states being @xmath17-wave , so instead , it was proposed that quarks are either@xcite para - fermions@xcite of order 3 or@xcite fermions with an extra quantum number taking three values , which we now know as _ color_.@xcite .",
    "the observed fermionic baryons @xmath18 are then symmetric in space - spin - flavor ( a ) for paraquarks automatically , or ( b ) for fermion quarks antisymmetrized in a color @xmath4 singlet state@xcite ( but not @xmath19 , because that would allow colorless diquark states @xmath20 ) .",
    "whether para - particle or colored multiplets would appear at higher energies or be banned completely ( quark confinement ) was not clear . in an attempt to make these extra states appear less weird ,",
    "colored quarks were initially given integer charges@xcite which , however , depended on the color index .",
    "then photons could excite color from hadrons and perhaps induce transitions to a deconfined ( weird ) sector .    in the model",
    "eventually adopted in 1972@xcite , quarks became colored fermions with fractional charges , with 3 colors for each charge or flavor .",
    "as a result , the electromagnetic and weak currents became color @xmath4 singlets , like the observed hadronic spectrum .",
    "confinement was as unclear for this model as the others .",
    "if confinement were not absolute , the model could have degenerate color multiplets and fractionally charged states above some threshold energy . comparing all of these models ,",
    "it was concluded that , as models of _ constituent _ quarks , they were hard to distinguish below thresholds for deconfinement .    however the 1972 model was also designed to take into account color for _ current _ quarks .",
    "the rest of this article describes how studies of short - distance behavior@xcite and the reaction@xcite @xmath21 led to this .",
    "i started life at caltech as a graduate student in the fall of 1968 .",
    "the very first seminar , on tuesday october 1 , was `` partons '' by richard p.feynman , with murray gell - mann sitting near the front .",
    "feynman had just returned from a summer in slac hearing about bjorken s work@xcite on scaling in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering and developing a model of point scatterers ( partons ) to give the same results .",
    "murray kept asking `` but richard , what are their quantum numbers ? are they quarks ? '' but richard s sole concern was scaling due to scattering by `` grains of sand inside the nucleon '' .",
    "( a year or so later , my fellow student finn ravndal got him interested in quarks . )",
    "murray began supervising me two months later and in due course asked me , as an initial research exercise , to try using the cutkosky bootstrap model @xcite to generate higher symmetries like @xmath22 . that produced hundreds of equations .",
    "fortunately , just a few of them could be used to show that there could be no consistent solution .",
    "murray commented that he had nt intended the exercise `` to be so vigorous '' and suggested that i take a trip while he thought of a suitable phd topic .",
    "my fellow student chris hamer and i had already planned to drive around the us that summer ( 1969 ) , so we left immediately and on the way back , stopped at aspen .",
    "murray had just started working on scale invariance as an approximate symmetry of hadrons , and suggested that i do the same .",
    "this would involve the energy - momentum tensor @xmath23 as well as the @xmath24 currents .",
    "did i know about the belinfante@xcite tensor ?",
    "i did ( from geoff opat , supervisor of chris and myself as masters students in melbourne , 1966 - 68 ) . in that case , the next step was to understand all 14 pages of wilson s paper on operator product expansions@xcite .",
    "wilson generalised current algebra , replacing equal - time limits of commutators by short - distance limits of products of currents and other observables such as @xmath23 . instead of a single term on the right - hand side , he obtained an asymptotic expansion @xmath25 with coefficient functions @xmath26 in order of decreasing singularity times observable operators @xmath27 of increasing operator dimensionality ( in mass units ) .",
    "equal - time commutators , such as in gell - mann s current algebra and bjorken s work on scaling , could be recovered by noting that , since commutators vanish for space - like separations , their equal - time limits are controlled by the short - distance behavior of the relevant operator product .",
    "checks in renormalized perturbation theories or for free current quarks indicated that , apart from quantum number constraints , the same set of operators @xmath28 tended to appear in the expansion , whatever the operator product used to generate them : `` a limited set of licensed operators '' , as murray put it .",
    "a key feature of wilson s work was his critique@xcite of canonical field theory : operators usually _ can not _ be multiplied at the same point , equal - time commutators may be singular , and @xmath29-ordering with step functions @xmath30 can fail .",
    "these _ anomalies _ arise wherever renormalization is necessary . in particular",
    ", renormalized perturbation theory produces @xmath31 factors at short distances , where @xmath32 is the renormalization scale . when summed up  la",
    "gell - mann and low,@xcite anomalous powers may be produced .",
    "if the ultraviolet limit is controlled by a nontrivial gell - mann  low fixed point , scale invariance becomes exact at short distances , with anomalous dimensions for all operators @xmath33 except those which are conserved or partially conserved .",
    "i was happy to abstract these rules and learn the renormalization group later .",
    "wilson s paper@xcite also featured a sec .",
    "vii `` applications '' with five subsections , each equivalent to a separate publication .",
    "subsection d `` @xmath21 problem '' drew my attention because ( a ) it explained how short - distance singularities determine contact terms in low - energy ward identities and ( b ) i had seen the papers of bell and jackiw@xcite and adler@xcite on the axial anomaly .",
    "could the three - point function @xmath34 of the electromagnetic and axial - vector currents @xmath35 and @xmath36 be determined at short distances without using perturbation theory ?",
    "noting wilson s comment ( sec .",
    "viii ) that `` the prospects for obtaining such a solution seem dim at present '' , i filed the problem away as a challenge for the future .    at that time",
    ", the main question was whether bjorken scaling is exact or not .",
    "bjorken@xcite obtained scaling by assuming that an infinite set of equal - time commutators of @xmath35 with its derivatives is finite , i.e.not zero .",
    "it was quickly established that this was equivalent to assuming canonical or free - field ( parton ) behavior for the coefficient functions ( [ coeff ] ) .",
    "towers of these short - distance singularities could be summed to form terms in an operator product expansion near the light cone @xmath37 , the limit in position space conjugate to bjorken s limit.@xcite by then , quarks were widely believed to be responsible for scaling , so the proposal of fritzsch and gell - mann@xcite to abstract the light - cone expansion from free - quark theory was logical .",
    "the argument against exact bjorken scaling was led by wilson.@xcite interactions tend to increase the dimensions of composite - field operators @xmath33 which are not conserved exactly or partially , making higher-@xmath38 functions ( [ coeff ] ) less singular on the light cone .",
    "the difficulty for this point of view was explaining why these anomalous corrections were _ all _ so small .",
    "nevertheless , i tended to belong to this school of thought .",
    "my concern was that any tensor operator @xmath39 lacking an anomalous dimension would be at least partially conserved , because the leading singularity of @xmath40 would be canonical and hence divergenceless .",
    "therefore , my view was that the _ only _ operators allowed to have canonical dimension were @xmath23 and the @xmath7 currents .",
    "in particular , there was the @xmath41 problem , which i knew from gell - mann s 1969 hawaii lectures@xcite .",
    "if we abstract from the free - quark model , the isoscalar current @xmath42 is conserved in the @xmath43 limit .",
    "this is a disaster@xcite because then the @xmath43 condensate @xmath44 _ also _ acts as an axial @xmath41 condensate .",
    "in addition to @xmath45 , there would have to be a fourth nambu - goldstone boson , an isoscalar @xmath46 meson of mass @xmath47 .",
    "if just one extra conserved current could cause so much trouble , we certainly did not want an infinite tower of them .",
    "the choice between canonical and anomalous dimensions would be cleared up by asymptotic freedom@xcite two years later . only @xmath23 and the @xmath48 currents behave canonically .",
    "coefficients @xmath49 of other operators @xmath33 have their canonical behavior modified by inverse logarithmic powers , corresponding to a very weak violation of bjorken scaling .",
    "the @xmath41 problem was not so easily dismissed , and while majority opinion is that it is understood , they all miss the reference@xcite where problems yet to be resolved are analysed .      at the same time",
    "( 1969 - 71 ) , i was supposed to be working on my phd research project .",
    "clearly the hadronic ground state @xmath50 breaks scale invariance very strongly , given the @xmath51 gev scale set by baryons . this could be simply due to scale invariance being badly broken explicitly , with the trace @xmath52 large as an operator .",
    "the alternative is that scale invariance is approximately conserved in the nambu - goldstone mode with a massless @xmath53 _ dilaton _ in the limit @xmath54 .",
    "the analogy with chiral symmetry was obvious . both chiral @xmath7 and scale symmetry would be manifest at short distances and hidden elsewhere by the effects of their goldstone bosons , the @xmath46 octet @xmath55 and the @xmath56 singlet dilaton @xmath57 ( not to be confused with the field `` @xmath57 '' of the sigma model ) .",
    "i chose the simplest case where scale invariance was the result of taking the chiral @xmath7 limit , so the 3-flavor version of the chiral condensate ( [ cond ] ) could also act as a scale condensate .",
    "this picture is no longer entirely accurate , given that qcd renormalization effects break scale symmetry everywhere , including short distances .",
    "however if 3-flavor qcd has an infrared fixed point @xmath58 , where @xmath52 vanishes apart from @xmath59 corrections , the essential features of the original scheme can be reproduced by a double expansion in the running gluon coupling @xmath60 about @xmath58 and the light quark masses @xmath59 about zero.@xcite    the dilaton idea is contained in footnote 38 of the 1962 current algebra paper.@xcite a `` resonance or quasi - resonance '' which dominates a dispersion relation for @xmath61 yields `` a relation of the goldberger - treiman type '' where `` the coupling of the resonant state to different particles is roughly proportional to their masses '' . in the scale - invariant limit,@xcite the vacuum would become degenerate , as for exact chiral symmetry , except for the degeneracy being noncompact .",
    "physical predictions are then the result of expanding in @xmath62 about zero .",
    "the term `` dilaton '' is often used in a manner which is distinct from the scheme above or even contradicts it .",
    "the earliest variant was fujii s proposal@xcite of a finite - range scalar component of gravity .",
    "gell - mann called it a `` brans - dickeon '' after the well - known proponents of the scalar - tensor theory of gravity@xcite , but the name did not stick . in modern times , `` dilaton '' is often used for a scalar particle which has zero mass classically but becomes massive due to quantum corrections , such as higgs bosons which acquire mass due to dimensional transmutation.@xcite since there is no way of `` turning off '' such a mass , this has nothing to do with dilatons in the original sense .    in my student days ,",
    "the main candidate for @xmath57 was @xmath63 , whose existence was not clear .",
    "final state pions interact very strongly in the @xmath53 channel , so there was good reason to assume the presence of a resonance far off shell .",
    "however that meant that it was very hard to pin down in phase - shift analyses .",
    "it was declared dead in the 1976 particle data tables , but in recent years , has been resurrected as the broad but clearly defined resonance@xcite @xmath64 .",
    "if dilatons couple to mass , why is its coupling to pions so large ? in leading order , one would expect @xmath65 to be @xmath66 for the coupling @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the analogue of the pion decay constant @xmath69 mev and has a similar order of magnitude : @xmath70 the solution , on which i based my phd thesis , was to note that the result is really @xmath71 and use approximate chiral symmetry to deduce the coefficient of @xmath62 : @xmath72 this implies a width of a few hundred mev , as required .",
    "i did it the hard way , using basic current algebra , and so took too long to obtain a mass formula for @xmath73 . in the meantime ,",
    "john ellis was working on his phd in cambridge ( uk ) , and obtained both eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) and the mass formula by efficient use of a chiral - scale effective lagrangian .",
    "a few months later , we met and were able to compare notes at the 1971 coral gables conference.@xcite    no account of these times would be complete without mentioning the episode in 1970 when feynman became excited about bose statistics for quarks .",
    "he hoped to explain the @xmath74 rule for nonleptonic decays of strange particles .",
    "how quarks could possibly be bosons was a matter for future study ; perhaps their bad statistics would not matter if they were confined .",
    "almost immediately , we heard that the idea had already been suggested@xcite , but the interest generated by feynman@xcite in this key problem was good for particle physics . a few months later",
    ", the correct version of the idea was proposed@xcite ( also anticipated in japan@xcite ) : for fermion quarks with color ( and even for paraquarks@xcite ) , the color antisymmetrization of @xmath1 states plus current algebra implies the @xmath74 rule for nonleptonic hyperon decays , but says nothing about @xmath74 for @xmath75 .    since nonleptonic strange particle decays had been a problem for so long,@xcite my interest was piqued .",
    "i told murray of this , carefully avoiding any suggestion that quarks could be bosons ( which i did nt believe anyway ) , and drew the response `` watch out , it s a can of worms !",
    "'' i was too busy finishing my phd to pursue it ; otherwise , i may have drawn fig .  1 , which is required by approximate chiral - scale invariance .",
    "it shows that the @xmath74 rule for kaons is due to a large contribution from the dilaton pole . only after 40-odd years , with help from my young colleague lewis tunstall , can i report a solution to that problem.@xcite for hyperon decays , the @xmath74 rule is understood , but current algebra does not seem to work : that part of the problem is still a can of worms .      from the literature on axial anomalies , i knew about schwinger s 1951 paper on gauge invariance@xcite . in sec .",
    "v , he obtained unique results for both @xmath21 and @xmath82 in one - loop yukawa theory by imposing gauge invariance on the renormalization procedure . in terms of the electromagnetic field",

    "already , wilson had shown@xcite that one - loop corrections in @xmath92 theory break scale invariance , which he interpreted as an anomaly in the trace of @xmath23 .",
    "perhaps there is an electromagnetic trace anomaly due to strong interactions ?",
    "i was moving to a post - doctoral job at cornell ; as soon as i arrived , i would try to extend wilson s method for @xmath21 to @xmath93 .      when schwinger analysed @xmath21 , chiral invariance and pcac ( partially conserved axial current ) were unknown .",
    "at issue was the equivalence @xmath94 between pseudoscalar and pseudovector couplings for the one - fermion - loop triangle diagram .",
    "the trouble was that the product of the fermion fields at the same point is singular .",
    "the solution was to consider @xmath95 and @xmath96 at different points @xmath97 and @xmath98 and make the analysis gauge invariant : then the limit @xmath99 becomes finite .",
    "rephrased in terms of chiral symmetry , the problem is that the noether construction fails because ( a ) it requires @xmath100 to be multiplied at the same point and ( b ) it does not work for non - local expressions produced by point splitting .",
    "the axial anomaly@xcite is responsible for this failure : it is the finite counterterm mismatch between gauge invariant and chiral invariant renormalization prescriptions for axial - vector operators .",
    "wilson s version of this was designed to avoid perturbation theory . in particular ,",
    "if pions are @xmath0 states which become nambu - goldstone bosons in the chiral limit , they are certainly not perturbative and so should not be represented by a perturbative field @xmath101 .",
    "the other key feature of his approach was the use of short distance analysis .",

    "in perturbation theory , it has long been known@xcite but not often noted that time ordering is part of the renormalization procedure . in general , `` @xmath29 '' must be regarded as an operation which depends on the renormalization prescription .",

    "being anxious to avoid model dependence , i allowed for the possibility that the electromagnetic current is not a pure @xmath4 octet , @xmath201 at that time , we did not know @xmath163 , @xmath188 or @xmath189 . in particular , data showing scaling behavior for @xmath202 hadrons was not available until the 1974 london conference , a year after asymptotic freedom .",
    "the value of @xmath12 could well be exactly 0.5 , so adler s non - renomalization theorem@xcite for @xmath12 suggested a theory with three species of quark , but i could not see how to deal with colored electromagnetic currents or paraquark operators .",
    "so when i received by return mail a letter from gell - mann proposing colored fractional quarks with color - neutral currents , it seemed to me that this clarified matters from the point of view of adler s theorem , but i felt ( for reasons discussed above ) that having free quarks on the light cone was going too far .",
    "however , sometimes an oversimplification can lead to correct answers  in this case , qcd@xcite and asymptotic freedom.@xcite    initially , the qcd proposal looked good as a model of constituent quarks , but not for current quarks and the @xmath21 analysis .",
    "having found the electromagnetic trace anomaly , we knew already that @xmath52 would have anomalous gluonic terms proportional to @xmath203 which would break scale and conformal invariance at short distances .",
    "what asymptotic freedom did was to turn qcd into a good theory of current quarks as well as constituent quarks .",
    "the breaking of scale invariance at short distances was minimal , being associated with operators which are not conserved exactly or partially .",
    "the analysis of @xmath21 can be still be carried through since all of the equations remain valid : they can be derived by using asymptotic freedom instead of asymptotic conformal invariance .",
    "the results for three colors are @xmath204 where the non - renormalization theorem for @xmath12 is _ not _ used .",
    "all of this goes through _ without _ treating pions perturbatively .",
    "the method of nested operator product expansions is now not needed for the @xmath21 derivation , but it is generally valid in renormalized field theory . as a result , coupling constant dependence of the form @xmath205 can be investigated.@xcite this program has been extensively pursued by andrei kataev , stan brodsky and their collaborators.@xcite                                                          y.  frishman , phys .",
