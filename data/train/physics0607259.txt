    "as the one - dimensional string model could only serve as a simplistic approximation to the real biological situation , we have also investigated under which conditions retinotopic projections between planar networks of neurons arise .",
    "obviously , this increase of the spatial dimension rendered the synergetic analysis so complicated that we were only able to treat physiologically interesting special cases .",
