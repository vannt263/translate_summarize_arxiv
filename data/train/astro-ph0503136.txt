    "the dark halo substructure has recently come to one of the most lively topics in cosmology .",
    "although the standard cosmological paradigm based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) concept generically predicts the presence of the substructure inside the dark matter halos , there are many questions yet to be answered associated with the dark halo substructures .",
    "the intrinsic alignment effect of the dark halo substructure is one of those questions .",
    "there are plenty of observational evidences that the major axes of the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) have a strong tendency to be aligned with that of their host clusters @xcite .",
    "the most popular theory for the bcg alignment is the anisotropic infall scenario based on the standard hierarchical clustering model @xcite : the initial density field of cdm is web - like , interconnected by the primordial filaments @xcite .",
    "the gravitational collapse and merging to form structures occurs not in an isotropic way but in an anisotropic way along the large - scale filaments .",
    "accordingly , the infall of materials into a cluster also occurs along the primordial filament , which will induce the alignment between the orientation of a host cluster and that of bcg embedded in it .",
    "there are several reasons that the anisotropic infall theory became so popular : being simple and intuitive , it fits very well into the cold dark matter paradigm .",
    "in addition , it has been supported by several numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) which demonstrated that the gravitational infall and merging of materials indeed occurs along the filaments .    nevertheless , the theory is only qualitative and still incomplete .",
    "recent observations indicate that not only the bcgs but also the less dominant cluster galaxies exhibit the alignment effect to a non - negligible degree @xcite . in the anisotropic infall model ,",
    "the substructure alignment is a primordial effect , and would get damped away quickly by the subsequent nonlinear processes such as the violent relaxation , the secondary infall , and so on @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is very unlikely that the cluster galaxies other than the bcgs keep the primordial alignment effect till the present epoch @xcite . here ,",
    "we propose that the initial tidal interaction between the subhalos and the host halo will be responsible for the observed intrinsic alignment of the cluster galaxies .",
    "when a subhalo forms inside a host halo , it acquires the angular momentum @xmath0 due to the tidal shear field @xmath1 generated by the gravitational potential of the host halo @xmath2 : @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite proposed the following formula to quantify the mutual correlations between @xmath4 and @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 $ ] is a correlation parameter to quantify the strength of the correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath5 , and @xmath9 is a unit traceless tidal shear tensor defined as @xmath10 with @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is a rescaled but not a unit angular momentum . if we replace the rescaled angular momentum by the unit angular momentum , @xmath13 in equation ( [ eqn : spin ] ) , then the correlation parameter @xmath14 is reduced by a factor of @xmath15 . note here that the lhs of equation ( [ eqn : spin ] ) represents a _",
    "conditional _ ensemble average of @xmath16 provided that the unit traceless tidal shear tensor is given as @xmath17 . for the detailed explanations of equation ( [ eqn : spin ] ) ,",
    "see appendix a in @xcite .",
    "it is naturally expected that @xmath14 decreases with time as the correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath5 must decrease after the moment of the turn - around due to the subsequent nonlinear process .",
    "@xcite found @xmath18 at present epoch by analyzing the data from the tully galaxy catalog and the point source redshift catalog redshift survey ( in their original work , they used a reduced correlation parameter @xmath19 and found @xmath20 ) .",
    "strictly speaking , equation ( [ eqn : spin ] ) holds only if @xmath8 and @xmath5 are defined at the same positions @xcite . here ,",
    "they do nt : @xmath8 and @xmath5 are defined at the centers of the mass of the host halo and the subhalo , respectively .",
    "for simplicity , here we just assume that equation ( [ eqn : spin ] ) still holds , ignoring the separation between the centers of the mass of the subhalos and that of the host halo .",
    "the distribution of @xmath5 under the influence of the tidal field is often regarded as gaussian @xcite : @xmath21^{1/2 } } \\exp\\left[-\\frac{l_{i}(m^{-1})_{ij}l_{j}}{2}\\right],\\ ] ] where the covariance matrix @xmath22 is related to the tidal shear field @xmath8 by equation ( [ eqn : spin ] ) . in the principal axis frame of @xmath8 ,",
    "let us express @xmath5 in terms of the spherical coordinates : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the polar and the azimuthal angles of @xmath5 .",
    "note that the polar angle @xmath25 represents the angle between the direction of @xmath5 of the subhalo and the minor principal axis of @xmath8 of its host .",
    "the probability density distribution of the cosines of the polar angle @xmath25 can be obtained by integrating out equation ( [ eqn : ldis ] ) over @xmath27 and @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath28 here the polar angle @xmath25 is forced to be in the range of @xmath29 $ ] satisfying @xmath30 , since we care about the relative spatial orientation of the subhalo axis , but not its sign . here",
    "the three @xmath31 s ( @xmath32 ) are the eigenvalues of @xmath8 in a decreasing order satisfying the following two conditions : ( i ) @xmath33 ; ( ii ) @xmath34 . if @xmath4 is a gaussian random field which is true in the linear regime , one can show that @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the following two assumptions : ( i ) on cluster scale , the principal axes of the inertia shape tensor @xmath37 of a host halo is aligned with its tidal shear tensor @xmath38 with the eigenvalues being in an opposite order . in other words , the major principal axis of @xmath37 is the minor principal axis of @xmath38 , and vice versa .",
    "note that in @xcite , it was erroneously stated that it the major axis of @xmath37 is the major axis of @xmath38 ( trujillo , carretero , & juncosa 2004 in private communication ) ; ( ii ) the minor axis of a subhalo is in the direction of its angular momentum .",
    "a justification of the first assumption is given by the zeldovich approximation @xcite which predicts a prefect alignment between the principal axis of @xmath37 and that of @xmath38 .",
    "since the cluster - size halos are believed to be in the quasi - linear regime where the zeldovich approximation is valid , the first assumption should provide a good approximation to the reality .",
    "moreover , recent n - body simulations indeed demonstrated that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are quite strongly correlated @xcite . regarding the second assumption",
    ", there is an established theory that the spin axis of an ellipsoidal object in the gravitational tidal field is well correlated with its minor axis @xcite , which was also confirmed by several n - body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )    now that the minor principal axis of @xmath8 is the major axis of the host halo , and @xmath5 is aligned with the minor axis of the subhalo , the polar angle @xmath25 in equation ( [ eqn : vtdis ] ) actually equals _ the angle between the minor axis of the subhalo and the major axis of the host halo_. putting @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , we simplify equation ( [ eqn : vtdis ] ) into @xmath42^{-3/2}d\\phi,\\ ] ]    in the asymptotic limit of @xmath43 , equation ( [ eqn : tdis ] ) can be further simplified into the following closed form : @xmath44    equations ( [ eqn : tdis ] ) and ( [ eqn : tdisa ] ) imply that @xmath45 increases as @xmath25 increases .",
    "that is , the minor axis of a subhalo has a strong propensity to be _ anti - aligned _ with the major axis of its host halo .",
    "hence , it explains the observed alignment effect between the subhalo and the host halo major axes as a consequence of the intrinsic anti - alignment between the subhalo minor axis and the host halo major axis .",
    "the value of @xmath14 in equations ( [ eqn : tdis ] ) and ( [ eqn : tdisa ] ) should depend on the distance from the host halo center ( @xmath46 ) , the subhalo mass ( @xmath47 ) and redshift ( @xmath48 ) : @xmath49 .",
    "what one can naturally expect is that @xmath14 should decrease with @xmath46 since the tidal interaction must be strongest in the inner part of the host halo , and that @xmath14 should increase with @xmath47 and @xmath46 since the alignment effect gets reduced in the nonlinear regime .",
    "unfortunately , it will be very difficult to find thefunctional form of @xmath50 as @xmath14 contains all the nonlinear informations of galaxy evolution .",
    "we do not attempt to find @xmath51 here since it is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "instead , we simplely assume that @xmath14 is a constant , and determine the value of @xmath14 empirically by fitting equation ( [ eqn : tdis ] ) to the numerical results in @xmath52 .",
    "the data we use in this letter is the high resolution halo simulations of @xcite .",
    "first they selected dark matter halos from their previous cosmological p@xmath53 m n - body simulations with @xmath54 particles in a @xmath55mpc cube @xcite .",
    "the halos were identified using the standard friend - of - friend ( fof ) algorithm , among which four halos on cluster - mass scales ( with mass around @xmath56 ) were then re - simulated using the nested - grid p@xmath53 m code which was designed to simulate high - resolution halos .",
    "the force resolution is typically @xmath57 of the virial radius , and each halo is represented by about @xmath58 particles within the virial radius .",
    "we then use the subfind routine of @xcite to identify the disjoint self - bound subhalos within these halos , and include those subhalos containing more than 10 particles in the analysis .",
    "these simulations adopted the `` concordance '' @xmath59cdm cosmology with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .    using this numerical data , we first compute the inertia tensors as @xmath63 for each host halo and its subhalos in their respective center - of - mass frames .",
    "then , we find the directions of the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of the host halo and the subhalo inertia tensors , respectively , by rotating the inertia tensors into the principal axes frame , and determine the major axes of each host halo and the minor axis of its subhalos .",
    "then , we measure the cosines of the angles , @xmath25 , between the major axis of the host halo and the minor axes of their subhalos by computing @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 represent the major and the minor axes of the host halo and its subhalos , respectively . finally , we find the probability density distribution , @xmath67 , by counting the number density of the subhalos .",
    "when computing the probability density distribution , we use all the subhalos in the host halo linked by the fof algorithm .",
    "we perform the above procedure at four different redshifts : @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the total number of the subhalos @xmath70 at each redshift is @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : dis1 ] plots the final numerical distributions ( solid dots ) with the error bars .",
    "the error bar at each bin is nothing but the poisson mean for the case of no alignment given as given as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the number of the subhalos at each bin .",
    "as one can see , the numerical distribution @xmath67 increases as @xmath25 increases , revealing that the minor axes of substructures really tend to be anti - aligned with the major axes of their host halos , as predicted by the analytic model ( eq.[[eqn : tdis ] ] ) of @xmath77 .",
    "figure [ fig : dis1 ] also plots the analytic predictions ( solid line ) and the approximation formula ( dashed line ) derived in @xmath77 .",
    "the horizontal dotted line represents the uniform distribution of @xmath78 for the case of no alignment .",
    "we fit the analytic distributions to the numerical data points to determine the best - fit values of the correlation parameter @xmath14 .",
    "we find @xmath79 at @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "the errors involved in the determination of @xmath14 is given as the standard deviation of @xmath14 for the case of no alignment effect given as @xmath81 where @xmath70 is the number of all subhalos used to compute @xmath14 .",
    "the value of @xmath14 increases with redshifts @xmath48 , as expected .",
    "in fact the value of @xmath82 gives quite a good fit , if not the best , not only at the present epoch of @xmath83 but also at all earlier epochs of @xmath84 , which implies that the initially induced anti - alignment effect is more or less conserved , reflecting the fact that the directions of the subhalo angular momentum are fairly well conserved .",
    "to understand the dependence of the alignment effect on the subhalo mass , we derive the same probability distribution but by using only the most massive 30 subhalos in each cluster ( @xmath85 for each redshift ) , and find the corresponding best - fit values of @xmath14 .",
    "we find @xmath86 at @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : dis2 ] plots the results .",
    "the approximation formula ( eq.[[eqn : tdisa ] ] ) is excluded in this figure since the best - fit values of @xmath14 for this case is pretty close to unity .",
    "although the large error bars prevent us from making a quantitative statement , it is obvious that the anti - alignment effect is stronger for the case massive subhalos .",
    "although the currently popular anisotropic merging and infall scenario has provided a qualitative explanation for the bcg - cluster and cluster - cluster alignments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no previous approach based on this scenario was capable of making a quantitative prediction for the alignment effect of cluster galaxies other than bcgs with the host clusters .",
    "we constructed an analytic model where the substructure alignment is a consequence of the tidal field of the host halo at least on the scale of cluster galaxies , and predicted quantitatively the strength of the alignment effect , by comparing the model with the results from recent high - resolution n - body simulations .",
    "however , it is worth noting that we have yet to completely rule out the anisotropic infall model . an idealistic way to discriminate our analytic model from the anisotropic infall scenario would be to measure directly the correlation of the directions of the subhalo angular momentum with the host halo orientations",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to determine the directions of the subhalo angular momentum vectors in current simulations . because the rotation speed of a dark halo in simulations is only a few percent of the virial motion of the particles , one needs more than @xmath87 particles to determine accurately the direction of the angular momentum vector of a subhalo with an average rotation speed . in current simulations the subhalos have much fewer particles than @xmath87",
    "this is why we used the minor axes of the subhalos rather than the directions of the subhalo angular momentum vectors to investigate the intrinsic alignments of substructures .",
    "nevertheless , the strong alignment between the halo minor axes and angular momentum vectors @xcite should indicate indirectly that the anti - alignments between the subhalo minor axes and the host halo major axes observed in our simulations are likely to be caused by the host halo tidal field as our model predicts .",
    "many n - body simulations @xcite have already proved that the dark matter halos rotate and their angular momentum vectors are aligned with their minor axes .",
    "furthermore , @xcite demonstrated evidently that there are good internal alignments between the halo minor axes and angular momentum vectors measured at different radii .",
    "therefore , the alignments between the halo angular momentum vectors and the minor axes are expected to be hold even when the outer parts of the halos get disrupted when they fall into larger halos as substructures .",
    "indeed , we ourselves check this effect in our simulations : we measure the angular momentum vectors of several very massive subhalos with more than @xmath88 particles , and find that the subhalos have _ non - zero _ angular momentum and that the subhalo minor axes are strongly aligned the directions of their angular momentum : the cosines of all alignment angles turn out to be bigger than @xmath89 .",
    "anyway , it will be definitely necessary to investigate directly the correlations of the directions of the subhalo angular momentum with the orientations of their host halos in the future with larger simulation data , where the number of particles belonging to subhalos should be large enough . using larger simulation data",
    ", it will be also possible to determine the functional form of the correlation parameter @xmath90 .",
    "our future work is in thisdirection .",
