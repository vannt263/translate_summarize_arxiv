    "the theory of the propagation of radio waves through the interstellar medium is constantly evolving .",
    "the plasma modulation phenomena affecting radio waves can be described by means of the three - dimensional spatial power spectrum of electron density fluctuations , which is described by a kolmogorov spectrum @xcite : @xmath4    where @xmath5 is a measurement of the mean turbulence of the electron density along the line of sight and @xmath6 is the wavenumber associated with the spatial scale of turbulence @xmath7 .",
    "this formula holds , assuming that the spatial scale @xmath7 is between the inner and outer scales of the spatial density fluctuations ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the spectral index @xmath9 is believed to be in the range 3 - 5 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "kolmogorov theory , which describes the propagation of turbulent energy from large scales to small scales , gives the expected value of @xmath10 .",
    "the theory of interstellar scintillation ( iss ) was developed by @xcite .",
    "the simplest model commonly used for the explanation of scintillation and scattering effects is the _ thin screen _ model .",
    "although it was shown for the case of several lines of sight that this model does not explain the observed scintillation behaviour ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , its simplicity allows for easy understanding of these phenomena as well as an interpretation of the observational results . according to this model ,",
    "the irregularities of the interstellar medium are located within a thin screen , which is located midway between the pulsar and the observer .",
    "scattering within the screen causes the signal to be spread over a time interval @xmath11 ( called the pulse broadening time ) and hence shows a variety of phases over a range @xmath12 .",
    "phase modulation of the signal produces interference patterns at the observer s plane .    depending on the size of the wavefront perturbations",
    ", one can distinguish two types of interstellar scintillations , the so - called _ weak _ and _ strong _ scintillation regimes .",
    "the strong scintillations can be divided into two different branches : _ diffractive _ interstellar scintillations ( diss ) , arising from small - scale fluctuations ( @xmath13 m : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and _ refractive _ scintillations ( riss ) , which form due to large - scale irregularities ( @xmath14 m : * ? ? ?",

    "these sloped fringes can be characterized by the frequency drift rate @xmath70 , which can be related to the refractive scattering angle @xmath20 by the following expression : @xmath71    in this article , we present the results of our analysis of iss observations of psr  b0823 + 26 , at a frequency of 1.7 ghz .",
    "our observations were longer by a factor of four than any other observing project conducted for this pulsar in the past , since we had over 600 h of integration time for this pulsar .",
    "the observations were conducted at a frequency of 1.7 ghz using the 32-m toru centre for astronomy radio telescope .",
    "the total intensity signal was obtained using the penn state pulsar machine ii ( pspm ii:@xcite ) , which is basically a 64-channel filter - bank spectrometer with a total bandwidth of 192 mhz .",
    "calibration of the signal was performed by injecting the noise - diode signal to our receiver , which was carried out synchronously with the pulsar period . at the start and end of each observing session ,",
    "the noise diode signal itself was calibrated by means of total intensity observations of a well - known radio source 3c393.1 .",
    "the pspm ii output ( in the observing mode we used ) was basically 64 time - integrated pulse profiles corresponding to the backend spectral channels .",
    "this allowed us to perform both dynamic spectrum analysis and  after the dedispersion process and an offline integration of the whole bandwidth ",
    "total intensity ( pulsar average flux density ) measurements .    observations were conducted between 2003 and 2006 .",
    "we gathered data during 70 observing sessions , consisting of 5 min individual integrations .",
    "more than 50 of those sessions lasted for 10 h or more ; there were also shorter sessions ( lasting less than 6 h ) and the longest sessions lasted for more than 12 h. the total integration time of all our observations analysed for the purpose of this article was @xmath72 h.    the pulsar we observed was psr  b0823 + 26 .",
    "this is relatively well - studied source , but its scintillation properties have never before investigated in such a long - term extensive observing project .",
    "it is a typical , 530-ms period pulsar , which is relatively close at a distance of 0.38 kpc @xcite , with a dispersion measure of @xmath73  pc  @xmath74 .",
    "the scintillation parameters of the psr  b0823 + 26 have been measured previously by many authors at various frequencies , ranging from 74 mhz to 10.55 ghz ( see table  [ compare ] for a full list of references ) .      the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ flux ] presents the flux density averaged over the individual observing sessions versus observing epoch .",
    "as one can see , single - session average values range from @xmath75 1 mjy to over 30 mjy . to estimate the errors of the average flux measurements we used two methods .",
    "first we used an equation that considers the physical scintillation effects @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the total observation time , @xmath16 is refractive timescale ( we used @xmath78 min , see the following sections ) and @xmath79 is the expected riss modulation index ( based upon @xcite : @xmath80 ) . for the second method , we estimated rms for each individual session ( with the receiver / calibration noise factor included ) , which turned out to be up to 30 per cent of the average flux value .",
    "as a final uncertainty estimate for a given observing session we used the greater of the two values ; these are shown as error bars in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "we also calculated the total average flux value based on all available individual integrations , which yielded a value of @xmath81 = @xmath82 mjy .",
    "the flux density is strongly modulated in the individual sessions : panel ( 4 ) in fig .",
    "[ flux ] shows the value of the modulation index ( obtained using the formula given in equation [ modulation_index ] ) .",
    "the variation of the flux density during individual sessions usually showed the expected quasi - periodic fluctuations caused by the scintillations ; however , in a few of our observing sessions we found a characteristic disappearance of the pulsar signal .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ lens_long ] shows an example of a light curve with a flat - bottomed minimum between 150 and 250 min .",
    "a similar suppression in quasar light curves was observed by @xcite .",
    "they believe that the extinction of the flux corresponds to inhomogeneities of the interstellar medium in the form of a plasma lens ( with a gaussian distribution of density of free electrons ) crossing the line of sight of the quasar ( or , in principle , any point source ) . the disappearance of the source would be accompanied by a caustic increase of the flux just prior to and immediately after the minima , due to the increase in flux caused by the reflection of radiation by the incoming / outgoing plasma lens .",
    "a detailed study of such occurrence could allow for estimation of the size and possibly velocity of such plasma lenses ; however , we found our data to be insufficient for that purpose . only in one case",
    "were we able to observe the full extent of such an event , lasting for @xmath752 h ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ lens_long ] ) , but this particular observation is strongly affected by diffractive scintillations , which make finding the flux baseline - and hence the whole @xcite model - almost impossible .",
    "we also noted a few cases where the pulsar disappeared during the session ( with a flux increase just prior to it ) and was not detectable for the reminder of the session , i.e. the disappearance was at least 6 - 7 h long ( see the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ lens_long ] ) .",
    "we also detected one case where the pulsar was not visible at the beginning of the session but then suddenly appeared after a few hours ( apparently during a single 5 minute integration ) with a significant flux density value .",
    "overall , such occurrences appear not to be very common for psr  b0823 + 26 ( only four of our 70 sessions ) ; when such an occurrence appears , its duration is from 2 h up to intervals comparable to the length of our observing session , or possibly longer .",
    "the dynamic spectrum is a measure of the intensity of the pulsar at multiple frequencies over time .",
    "this is best described via a two - dimensional image of the pulse intensity as a function of time and frequency .",
    "the pulsar is a source emitting coherent radiation ; diffraction and refraction in the interstellar medium disturb the wavefront , which leads to self - interference , amplifying or suppressing the pulsar signal as a result .",
    "this can be seen in the dynamic spectrum as changing bright and dark bands or patches , which form a pattern of diffractive scintillations of a pulsar ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a single pattern ( enhanced region of flux density ) in a dynamic spectrum",
    "is called a scintle .    using the dynamic spectrum",
    ", one can estimate the decorrelation bandwidth @xmath57 , decorrelation ( diffractive ) time - scale @xmath83 and drift slopes @xmath70 .",
    "the values of the scintillation parameters are determined by fitting a two - dimensional gaussian function to the dynamic spectrum auto - correlation function . using standard given by @xcite , we define the decorrelation bandwidth @xmath57 as the half - width at half maximum of the intensity auto - correlation function .",
    "the scintillation time - scale @xmath83 is defined as the half - width at @xmath84 along the time lag axis .",
    "the drift rate is a measure of the slope of the line joining the points on the ellipse with the highest correlation at a given frequency offset @xcite and can be determined by finding the inclination angle of the fitted two - dimensional gaussian .",
    "we observed 20 dynamic spectra of psr  b0823 + 26 .",
    "[ dsf ] shows a sample of our dynamic spectra .",
    "the @xmath85-axis represents the frequency ( 64 spectral channels , each 3 mhz wide , centered at 1.7 ghz ) , and the @xmath86-axis is the epoch quantified by the 5-minute length of a single integration .    at the time of our observations",
    "the telescope was affected by a wide range of radio interference , both narrow - band persistent features , which basically destroyed all the data in several spectral channels of pspm ii , and short - time wide - bandwidth interference , capable of disturbing an individual integration over the entire observing bandwidth .",
    "most interference cleaning was performed in the offline analysis process .",
    "since the expected variations in the dynamic spectrum due to the scintillation phenomenon should be rather smooth , then any sharp or abrupt change in the measured flux density ( with regard to both time and observing frequency ) can be attributed to radio interference .",
    "we removed such measurements from our dynamic spectra and replaced them by values interpolated from the adjacent measurements , which were not affected by radio interference .",
    "the results of our analysis of dynamic spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ flux ] ( top two panels ) .",
    "we also calculated the average values of the diffractive time - scale , @xmath87 min , the decorrelation bandwidth , @xmath3 mhz , and the drift rate , @xmath88  min  mhz@xmath23 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the proper motion and the heliocentric parallax measurements of psr  b0823 + 26 provide us with a good estimate of both the pulsar distance and its transverse velocity , which is @xmath89km / s @xcite .",
    "table [ compare ] also shows the results for the scintillation velocity , which should be close to the pulsar transverse velocity . in the past",
    ", various authors used a different distance and the @xmath90 constant ( see references ) to determine @xmath17 .",
    "we generalized their measurements ( table  [ compare ] , sixth column ) and recalculated the scintillation velocity using the proper values of the distance @xmath91 = 0.38  kpc and the constant @xmath92 ( see eq .",
    "[ vis ] ) . for our data we estimated @xmath17 = @xmath50",
    "km / s . in principle , the values of velocity should be similar , regardless of the observing frequency .",
    "however , even after the recalculation one can still note major differences",
    ".    one possible explanation may be that our value comes for the grand average of both our diss time - scale measurements and our decorrelation bandwidth measurements , an average from @xmath93 h of integration .",
    "however , if we take a values of both @xmath0 and @xmath57 from some of our individual sessions , we can get a result similar to the proper motion velocity and close to the value of 220 km / s , which would be in better agreement with the previously published results .",
    "such a discrepancy , especially when it comes from a single - epoch measurements , may arise from the fact that the scintillation velocity is a vector sum of pulsar proper motion , the earth s orbital motion @xmath94 and the bulk flow of the intensity irregularities @xmath95 . depending on the epoch and the screen location , @xmath96 may add up to 30 km / s while @xmath95 is usually less than 10 km / s @xcite .",
    "in this article we have shown the results of long - term observations of the pulsar psr  b0823 + 26 at a frequency of 1.7 ghz .",
    "the total integration time of all observations we used was @xmath72 h , which makes our project the most extensive study of this pulsar s scintillation parameters . using analysis of dynamic spectra",
    ", we found average interstellar scintillation parameters , such as time - scale @xmath0 = @xmath97 min and decorrelation bandwidth @xmath15 = @xmath48 mhz .",
    "we also observed characteristic drift patterns with a drift rate of @xmath98  min  mhz@xmath23 , which indicates the presence of refractive scintillations . using the values of @xmath0 and @xmath15 , we estimated the scintillation velocity to be @xmath17 = @xmath50  km / s .",
    "our analysis using the structure function method , which we consider more reliable due to a larger sample of data available , yielded a slightly different value of the diffractive time - scale , @xmath0 = @xmath1 min .",
    "we were also able to analyze the refractive scintillations characteristics for this pulsar .",
    "the dynamic spectrum showed characteristic drifting patterns , which are formed by refraction at large scales .",
    "we estimated the time - scale of the variation to be @xmath2  min .",
    "the measurement of both scintillation time - scales allowed us to estimate the strength of the scattering parameter as @xmath99 and the critical frequency as 5  ghz .",
    "we estimated the derived scintillation parameters such as diffractive scale @xmath100 m , fresnel scale @xmath101 m , diffractive angle @xmath102 mas , refractive scale @xmath103 m and refractive angle @xmath104 mas .",
    "addition of our results to those available in the literature allowed us to estimate the frequency dependence of the scintillation parameters in the range 741700  mhz .",
    "its diffractive time - scale varies accordingly to a kolmogorov - type turbulence spectrum ( with either a single thin - screen model or uniform medium distribution ) , but one may argue that the decorrelation bandwidth does not comply with this .",
    "however , since this non - compliance is marginal ( see section  [ spectrum_of_plasma ] ) , we believe that psr  b0823 + 26 may be considered as a source behaving accordingly to kolmogorov s theory .    summarizing , we analyzed the largest data sample available so far for this pulsar .",
    "this scintillation behaviour of this close - by object may be ( marginally ) explained by a pure single thin - screen model .",
    "however , one has to remember that in our analysis we had no choice but to average our values over an entire observational time span , since some of the parameters ( like the refractive time - scale ) were measurable only for a few individual sessions .",
    "such approach will definitely average out any interstellar medium inhomogeneity effects , if they are present ( such inhomogeneities were observed for other low - dm pulsars ; see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this may falsify the results of the scintillation parameters and in turn affect the derived spectral indices .",
    "we believe that the observed disappearances of the pulsar are the best proof that indeed the interstellar medium along the psr  b0823 + 26 line of sight is not homogeneous .",
