    "the stock price is known to fluctuate in the real market and the trajectory of the stock price is considered to be a random walk , although the reason for the fluctuation remains an open question , as pointed out in the fundamental textbook of microeconomics @xcite .",
    "it is observed that the evolution of the price has some statistical properties or patterns that differs from a gaussian random walk .",
    "the present paper introduces a new model that is composed of three elements : mutation of dealers , majority rule and feedback by the price , as basic elements for the change of a stock price in a real market @xcite .",
    "the proposed model can be regarded as a simplified market in which the dealers behavior ( position ) changes based on the influence of the price . we show herein that in the model , the price oscillates under some condition by applying the van der pol equation which is a deterministic approximation of the proposed model .",
    "we introduce a ternary interaction model of a finite particle , which makes excursions that are similar to the ising model , assuming a mutation to the other type for each particle @xcite . using the ising model the analysis of the market has been discussed @xcite , and modeling the financial market by some form of ising structure of the interactions of agents has been achieved in several studies @xcite .",
    "based on the ising model , spontaneous magnetization can only occur in the thermodynamic limit . in a finite lattice",
    ", the system makes excursions from states with a uniformly negative magnetization through this intermediate mixed - phase state to states with a uniformly positive magnetization @xcite .",
    "consider an urn model @xcite .",
    "assume that there are two boxes , the plus box ( @xmath0 ) and the minus box ( @xmath1 ) and the number of particles contained in each box is @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the total number of the particles is @xmath4 , and every particle is numbered from 1 to @xmath5 .",
    "the following step , composed of three substeps i ) , ii ) and iii ) , is successively applied to particles in the two boxes .    1 .",
    "_ mutation _ : one particle out of @xmath5 particles is chosen at random and it moves from its box into the other box with probability @xmath6 and does not move with probability @xmath7 , ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "majority rule _ : we take three particles at random in each step . if two of the particles taken are in the plus box and one is in the minus box , the one in the minus box is moved to the plus box and the price @xmath9 is increased by 1 , while , if two of the particles are in the minus box and one is in the plus box , the one in the plus box is moved to the minus box and the price @xmath9 is decreased by 1 .",
    "if the three particles taken are in the plus box , no change occurs for the particles and the price @xmath9 is increased by 3 , while , if the three particles taken are in the minus box , no change occurs for the particles and the price @xmath9 is decreased by 3 .",
    "feed back _ :",
    "we change the number of particles in the plus box @xmath2 ( this may be equally applied to the minus box @xmath3 ) , with the probability which is proportional to the price @xmath9 .",
    "that is , if @xmath9 is a positive number , @xmath2 is decreased by 1 with probability @xmath10 , while , if @xmath9 is negative , @xmath2 is increased by 1 with probability @xmath11 .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath9 can be larger than @xmath5 when @xmath12 is large , but we only discuss in the case of @xmath13 in this paper .",
    "this condition is almost valid when @xmath14 .",
    "let each particle in the plus box represent a buy - position dealer , and each particle in the minus box represent a sell - position dealer .",
    "substep i ) models the position of each dealer changing randomly in a real market and corresponds to mutation in population genetics .",
    "this process may represent the random fluctuation ( noise ) in a real market .",
    "substep ii ) models the change of the position of a dealer from sell to buy or from buy to sell after considering the behaviour of the other dealers @xcite .",
    "this process represents the majority orienting behaviour or herding behaviour of dealers in the real market .",
    "this ternary interaction is one of the simplest interactions that we could think of for this type of urn model .",
    "substep iii ) models the change of dealers position under the influence of the price on the market .",
    "if the price goes up , the buy - position dealers usually change their position to sell , whereas if the price goes down , the sell - position dealers may change their position to buy .",
    "the ternary interaction in our model gives a linear term as we will show later ( in eq .",
    "( [ d y / dt = x ] ) ) , which gives the van der pol equation when combined with eq .",
