    "we investigate the anderson localization of fermions at the dirac point in graphene with different types of disorder by using the standard finite - scaling analysis together with the transfer - matrix technique .",
    "the dirac point corresponds to the band center ( @xmath0 ) of a tight - binding hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice . in the real - space tight - binding representation",
    "the disorder can be introduced with randomly distributed site energies , as called diagonal disorder , or with random hopping integrals named as off - diagonal ( od ) disorder .",
    "it is known that the localization behavior at the band center of a bipartite lattice with od disorder is anomalous due to the chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "for instance , the decay of wavefunctions at the band center on 2d square lattice with od disorder is much weaker than exponential .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is also bipartite , and there are other unusual features at the dirac point such as the massless dirac fermion dispersion relation .",
    "so it is interesting to investigate the difference in the localization behavior at the dirac point between diagonal and off - diagonal disorders .",
    "we derive the formula of transfer matrix for honeycomb lattice from which the numerical studies can be carried out to calculate interesting properties such as the rescaled localization length , the size and shape dependencies of the conductance .",
    "the finite - size scaling analysis reveals that although all the states are localized in the system with diagonal disorder , in the case of od disorder , the states at the dirac point are delocalized . from the calculated shape dependence of the conductance at @xmath0 on an @xmath11 rectangular lattice we find that when all the hopping integrals are positive , the conductance is independent of @xmath5 , but if the distribution includes both the positive and negative hopping integrals , the conductivity becomes shape independent .",
    "diagonal disorder corresponds to atomic scatterers such as doped impurities , while od disorder without sign changes of hopping integrals represents randomness of bond lengths caused by topological corrugations or warping in the sheets .",
    "for graphene od disorder is more important than diagonal disorder owing to the ultrathin one - layer structure and the purity requirement in preparing the samples . in both types short - range disorder",
    "can exist and the intervalley scattering is not excluded .",
    "thus the obtained results should be different from those by using models without intervalley scattering due to different symmetry classes .",
    "the sign randomness of hopping integrals can be produced by geometric or berry phase @xmath12 which is acquired by electron wavefunctions in every period of cyclic evolution around dirac point in parameter space .",
    "the dirac point can serve as the degenerate point for geometric phase in  slow \" cyclic evolutions , such as in - plane vibrations of displacement between two sublattices , due to the specific dispersion relation and electron - lattice interaction .",
    "the main features of the band structure in graphene can be well described by a tight - binding hamiltonian with one @xmath13 orbital per site on a honeycomb lattice @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the energy level at site @xmath17 , @xmath19 denotes the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites , and @xmath4 is hopping integral between nn sites @xmath17 and @xmath20 . here , the spin indices are not explicitly included . in the absence of disorder ,",
    "@xmath21 for all @xmath17 and @xmath22 for all @xmath23 , this hamiltonian leads to the 4-component dirac fermion dispersion relation near the dirac point @xmath0 .",
    "the diagonal and off - diagonal disorder can be introduced by adopting random variables @xmath18 and @xmath4 satisfying distribution probabilities @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "these probability functions define strengths and types of disorder in the system .",
    "diagonal disorder represents potential fluctuations due to impurities or due to randomness on substrate surface .",
    "a most commonly used distribution probability for diagonal disorder is the square function @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the distribution width describing the strength of disorder . for od disorder , there are different distribution functions describing different types of randomness . if we consider slight fluctuations of bond lengths around their average value due to lattice distortions , the following distribution is suitable @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is a measure of the bond - length fluctuations which make the nn hopping integrals randomly shift from @xmath31 .    in @xmath32",
    "all hopping integrals have the same sign as @xmath31 , reflecting that only changes of magnitude of @xmath4 are considered . in some cases",
    ", however , @xmath4 not only fluctuate in magnitude , but also change in sign due to specific physical mechanisms .",
    "one of these possible mechanisms is the geometric phase due to dynamical vibrations .",
    "the on - plane displacement between two sublattices , denoted as @xmath33 , changes all the nn bond lengths and thus linearly couples with electron states in the regime of small @xmath34 . at a dirac point",
    "( @xmath0 ) the states are doubly degenerate at @xmath35 .",
    "the displacement @xmath36 linearly removes the degeneracy , leading to conical energy surfaces in the parameter space spanned by @xmath37 and @xmath38 with the degenerate point situated at the origin @xmath39 . owing to thermal excitations or even to zero - point oscillations ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 vibrate and both of them are dependent on time with period @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the frequency of vibrations .",
    "usually the amplitudes and relative phase of @xmath37 and @xmath38 vibrations are statistically random . for generic values of them ,",
    "the track in the @xmath37-@xmath38 parameter space in a period is an ellipse encircling the degenerate point .",
    "thus , according to the berry theorem , in each period of vibrations electron wavefunctions at dirac point will acquire a geometric phase @xmath12 in addition to the ordinary dynamical phase . at the same time in this period",
    "the tunneling electron has traversed a path of length @xmath42 which equals @xmath43 nn bonds with @xmath44 and @xmath45 being the fermi velocity and bond length respectively .",
    "this means that the electron states change sign in traversing every @xmath43 bonds .",
    "such an effect occurs very naturally since the vibrations and electron transport are proceeding simultaneously . to include such an effect in a primary way",
    ", we introduce the sign - changing probability of an nn hopping @xmath46 .",
    "this probability can be estimated from the length by which the electron state changes sign due to the geometric phase , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "with such a sign - change model the wavefunction can automatically change sign in traversing every length of @xmath42 which , averagely , contains only one hopping with opposite sign .",
    "this is a special gauge in which the geometric phase acquired in a path of @xmath43 bonds is concentrated into one bond in this path .",
    "this gauge is valid under the condition that the interferences between paths shorter than @xmath42 are not relevant .",
    "as we will see below , the transport properties at dirac point in the case of od disorder ( including the sign changes ) are scale - invariant .",
    "so the short - range processes are not important and the above condition can be satisfied .",
    "this sign - change mechanism is different from the dephasing effect in the model of ref . where the distortions are fluctuating in the space ( the ripples ) but are static in time .",
    "we introduce the following distribution of @xmath4 @xmath48 to account for the sign - change probability @xmath46 . when @xmath49 or @xmath50 , all the hopping integrals have the same sign and @xmath51 reduces to @xmath32 . at @xmath52",
    "the probability of the sign changes is maximal .",

    "the propagation properties of an electron on a finite lattice can be given by a relation between amplitudes on both sides .",

    "we note that graphene lattice can be divided into two sublattices as distinguished by red and blue sites in fig .",
    "1 . from the tight - binding nature of the hamiltonian and",
    "the structure shown in fig .",
    "1 it can be seen that for given @xmath60 all amplitudes can be iteratively calculated along the @xmath55 ( @xmath54 ) direction if the amplitudes in the light - cyan shaded column ( light - magenta shaded row ) are given . from this a transfer matrix along the @xmath55 or @xmath54 direction can be given .",
