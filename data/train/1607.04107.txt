    "the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) source counts were extracted from a circular region centered on the source position , and with a radius of 10 pixels ( 1 pixel corresponds to 2.36 ) , and the background events from an annulus of inner and outer radius of 10 and 20 pixels , respectively . only the observation soon before the bat trigger , which yielded a severe pile - up , had to be extracted differently . in this case",
    "we modeled the wings of the radial profile of the source point - spread function ( psf ) with a king function ( moretti et al .",
    "2005 ) , extrapolated the model back to the core of the psf , and excised the inner 3.5 pixels of the extraction region .",
    "we grouped the background - subtracted spectra so to have at least 20 counts per energy channel , and fitted them jointly within xspec v.12.9 ( which was used for all spectral analysis presented in this work ) , limiting our analysis to the 110  kev energy range .",
    "we analysed the -bat data relative to the burst .",
    "the t90 duration of the event ( i.e. , the time during which 90% of the burst counts were collected ) was @xmath2  s and its total duration was @xmath310  ms .",
    "these durations were computed by the bayesian blocks algorithm battblocks on mask - weighted light curves binned at 1  ms in the 15150  kev , where essentially all the emission is contained .",
    "the bat mask - tagged light curves , images and spectra were created only for the burst event ( trigger 700791 , obs.id 00700791000 ) . we extracted a 15150-kev sky image and performed a blind source detection over the whole duration of the burst : a single , point - like source was detected at high significance ( 14.5@xmath4 ) at the best - fit coordinates @xmath5 , with an uncertainty radius of 1.5  arcmin ( 1@xmath4 , including a systematic error of 0.25  arcmin ; see tueller et al .",

    "the acis - s was configured in continuous clocking ( cc ) mode with faint telemetry format , yielding a readout time of 2.85  ms at the expense of one dimension of spatial information .",

    "the average source net count rate was @xmath11 counts  s@xmath12 , which guarantees no pile up issues in the data set .",

    "we ran the nuproducts script to extract light curves and spectra and generate instrumental response files separately for fpma and fpmb .",

    "we chose such a small extraction region for the source counts to limit the contamination from the snr and to avoid a large region contaminated by ghost rays that extends up to @xmath340 from the source .",

    "the light curve of the -bat burst shows a double - peak profile ( fig.[burst ] ) .",
    "we fit the time - averaged spectrum extracted from the total duration of 10  ms with simple single - component models typically used for magnetar bursts : a power law , a blackbody , and an optically - thin thermal bremsstrahlung ( e.g. , israel et al . 2008 ) .",
    "only the blackbody model provided an acceptable fit , with a reduced @xmath15 , @xmath16 for 56 degrees of freedom ( dof ) and temperature @xmath17  kev ( all errors are given at 1@xmath4 confidence level here an throughout the paper ) .",
    "the corresponding flux is @xmath18  in the 15150  kev range ( corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath19at 3.3kpc ) . as suggested by the energy - resolved light curve ( fig.[burst ] ) , the second peak is weaker and has a softer spectrum than the first one .",
    "the first @xmath35  ms of the event can be fit by a blackbody with @xmath20  kev , while for the second peak the blackbody temperature is @xmath21  kev .      for the timing analysis ,",
    "all photon arrival times were reported to the solar system barycentre frame , using the de200 ephemerides and the position ( de luca et al .",
    "first , we started a blind search for any fast periodic and aperiodic signals using our new and data sets , using the xronos timing package as well as the @xmath22 test ( buccheri et al . 1983 ) .",
    "we did not find any periodic signal via a fourier transform , and we could detect in both observations only the known @xmath36.67hr periodic modulation in the light curve ( see fig.[lc ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we also searched for periodic signals by assuming the 6.6hr modulation as the orbital period , and correcting the time series for the doppler shift that such an orbit might cause to any shorter periodic signal , but with no success .",
    "we inferred 3@xmath4 pulsed fraction upper limits for fast periodic signals ( as explained in israel & stella 1996 ) , of 5% ( 0.0110 hz ) , 6% ( 10100 hz ) and in the 7 - 9% range for the highest sampled frequencies ( 100 - 200 hz ) , for the observation . a similar analysis carried out on the data resulted on 3@xmath4 upper limits of 12% ( 0.013 hz ) , and in the range 2634% at higher frequencies ( 31000 hz ) .",
    "the light curve of the data ( the longest continuous dataset for ) is well fitted by two sinusoidal functions with fundamental period 24095@xmath23167s ( at tjd 17565.0 ) , and compatible periodicities adequately fit also the simultaneous data ( 23983@xmath23263s at tjd 17564.7 ; see fig.[lc ] )    in addition to the new observations , in search for a period derivative or any variability of the long term modulation , we re - analysed all available observations ( at the time of writing ) longer than 18ks ( 7 observations ) , and the two archival observations ( de luca et al .",
    "we performed a phase fitting analysis trying to follow the temporal evolution of the phases , but could not find a coherent timing solution due to the sparse observations . in fig.[lc ]",
    "we show the best determinations of the @xmath36.67  hr period using the longest available datasets , as well as the profile of the periodicity for the two most extreme cases of a pure single peak ( in 2005 ; de luca et al .",
    "2006 ) , and a clear double peak ( in june 2016 ; this paper ) .",
    "we also studied the variability of the profile as a function of the energy in the 125kev energy , and found that the first peak is significantly softer than the second .",
    "we started the spectral analysis by fitting simultaneously the new and observations ( see fig.[spectra ] ; the source is detected above the background from 1.128kev ) .",
    "we found that although the spectrum alone is well fit with two blackbodies , this is not the case when taking into account also the hard x - ray spectrum of the .",
    "best joint fit is found for a model comprising of two absorbed ( @xmath24  ) blackbodies with temperatures of kt@xmath25kev and kt@xmath26kev with radii ( assuming a 3.3kpc distance hereafter : caswell et al .",
    "1975 ) of r@xmath27 km and r@xmath28 km , plus the addition of a power - law component with photon index @xmath29 ( adding a constant between the two instruments to account for inter - calibration uncertainties , which was always within 10% ) .",
    "the total observed flux in the 0.530kev energy range is @xmath30  , and the joint fit gives @xmath31 ( 660 dof ) .      to study the outburst history of , we re - analysed all the available , , and  data of the source acquired from 1999 until 2016 july ( see fig.[longterm ] ) .",
    "all spectra were fitted by fixing the absorption column density to the best value derived using ( @xmath32 ) plus two blackbody components ( because at these soft energies the power - law is not required by the fit ) .",
    "we show the extrapolated 0.510kev luminosity in fig.[longterm ] .",
    "the source showed two outbursts in the past @xmath317years , empirically fitted with a constant plus 3 exponential decays , and having a total ( impulsive plus persistent ) emitted energy in the 0.5 - 10kev band of @xmath33erg and @xmath34erg ( extrapolating at when it will reach quiescence in about a year time ) .",
    "both outbursts are characterised by the heating of two different regions on the surface , the first one that evolved from the outburst peak until quiescence from @xmath350.60.4kev ( @xmath36 km ) , while the second one ( very dim in quiescence ) from @xmath371.40.7kev ( @xmath38 km ) . as we observed in this work for the first time , at @xmath39kev during the outburst peak ,",
    "a non - thermal component is also present , and certainly pulsed until @xmath40kev .",
    "we report on the first discovery of a magnetar - like short burst from a cco , and study its coincident x - ray outburst activity .",
    "this short ms - burst and its spectrum , the outburst energetic , spectral decomposition and cooling ( see  [ results ] ) are perfectly in line with what observed in magnetar outbursts ( see rea & esposito 2011 ; pons & rea 2012 ) .",
    "furthermore , the non - thermal component that we observed with is also very typical , and will most probably fade quickly during the outburst decay .",
    "magnetar outbursts are expected to be produced by the instability of strong magnetic bundles that stress the crust ( from inside or outside ; perna & pons 2011 ; pons & rea 2012 ; beloborodov 2009 ) heating the surface in one or more regions , and at different depth inside the ns crust ( than then drives how long the outburst will last each time ) .",
    "the high density of electrons in these bundles might also cause resonant cyclotron scattering of the seed thermal photons , creating non - thermal high - energy components in the spectrum ( that might be transient if the untwisting of these bundles during the outburst decay produces a decrease in the scattering optical depth ) .",
    "furthermore , magnetospheric re - arrangements are expected during these episodes , that are believed to be the cause of the short x - ray bursts ( see turolla , zane & watts ( 2015 ) for a review ) .",
    "repeated outbursts on an yearly timescale have also been detected before ( i.e. or  ; bernardini et al .",
    "2011 ; kuiper et al . 2012 ; archibald et al . 2015 ) , and their recurrence time is expected to be related to the source magnetic strength , configuration and the ns age ( see perna & pons 2011 ; vigan et al .",
    "2013 ) .    in this scenario ,",
    "the only puzzling property of , that makes it unique among any sgr , axp , cco or other known ns , is the 6.67hr long periodicity ( which would represent the longest spin period ever detected in any pulsar , even considering slow pulsars in high mass x - ray binaries ) . on the other hand , the extreme variability of the modulation in time and energy ,",
    "strongly disfavour the 6.67hr modulation being due to an orbital period ( see detailed discussion in de luca et al .",
    "2008 ; but see also pizzolato et al .",
    "2008 ) , while again are fully consistent with the usual pulse profile variability observed in magnetars during flaring activity ( see i.e. the cases of , , and ; rea et al . 2009 , 2013 ; rodrguez castillo et  al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "isolated pulsar spin periods are observed to be limited to @xmath312s , with the slowest pulsars being indeed the magnetars .",
    "this period distribution is explained as due to magnetic field decay during the evolution of these neutron stars ( see pons , vigan & rea 2013 ) . if we consider the slowest isolated pulsar that magnetic - field decay might produce , by means of the 2d code from vigan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , by assuming only core - field , no crustal impurity , an initial field ranging from 10@xmath41gauss , and a typical spin period at birth in the range of 1300ms , we can not anyhow reproduce periods longer that @xmath42s .    given the magnetar nature of the x - ray emission of this source , we are now left with discussing all possible slow down mechanisms other than the typical pulsar dipolar loss , to explain how a magnetar within a snr with an age estimate of 2.2kyr ( carter et al .",
    "1997 ) could have ended up with such a long spin period . since its discovery",
    ", many authors already discussed several scenarios ( see de luca et al .",
    "2006 ; li 2007 ; pizzolato et al . 2008 ; bhadkamakar & gosh 2009 ; lui et al .",
    "2015 ; popov , kaurov , & kamiker 2015 ) , which we can not summarize here , however we will highlight and discuss the possibilities that remains open , with their possible open issues .    first possibility might be a long - lived fossil disks ( chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ) that forms via the circularisation of fall - back material after the supernova explosion ( see i.e. de luca et al . 2006 ; li 2007 ) .",
    "this might result in slowing down substantially the spin period .",
    "however , recent studies on the formation of fossil disks apparently disfavour their existence around nss under reasonable assumption on the magnetic torque in the pre - sn phase ( perna et al . 2014 ) , and indeed these fossil disks have been searched for decades around pulsars without a real conclusive detection yet . on the other hand , the magnetar flaring activity would most probably blow off such thin disks very quickly . furthermore , in this scenario it would not be straightforward to understand what would make different at formation from all other known pulsars ( especially when associated with a relatively standard snr ; frank , burrows & park 2015 ) .",
    "another possibility is a magnetar in a low mass x - ray binary with an m6 ( or later ; de luca et al . 2008 ) companion , emitting as if it was isolated , but that had the spin period tidally locked to the orbital motion of the system ( see i.e. pizzolato et al .",
    "however , also in this case an extreme fine - tuning is needed to explain how a very low mass companion remains bounded to the magnetar after a sn explosion .    the most viable interpretation we see , especially because perfectly in line with what proposed for other cco systems ( the `` anti - magnetars '' ; halpern & gotthelf 2010 ) , might be of a magnetar that had a strong sn fall - back accretion in the past , and now it spins - down via typical dipolar loss but with a long spin period due to the severe slow down in its early phases ( @xmath13 few hundreds years ) . in particular ,",
    "if is born with a magnetic field and spin period such that when the fall back accretion starts the source is at its equilibrium period ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) , then such accretion will not reach the surface but in the first years or more of its lifetime , the magnetar will stay in the propeller regime ( hence with a substantially larger torque than if in the ejector phase ) .",
    "when the fall - back accretion stops , the magnetar continue evolving as any other isolated pulsars , but with a substantially slower spin period .",
    "we leave the detailed theoretical calculations of this scenario to a subsequent paper in preparation .    this scenario easily unifies objects as young magnetars , ccos , or rcw103 as being formed similarly with an initial magnetic field of @xmath43 g , but depending on the exact initial magnetic field intensity , the proto - ns spin period , and the fall - back accretion rate of each sn explosion , direct surface accretion might take place burying the magnetic field in the crust creating the hidden - magnetar ccos , or the newly born ns might start in the propeller regime soon after birth , resulting in a severe slow - down of its initial spin period at birth .",
    "the latter might have been the case of the cco in rcw103 .",
