    "in a previous paper @xcite we examined in detail the problem of the fermionic pairing hamiltonian @xmath8 in the simple situation of one pair of nucleons coupled to an angular momentum @xmath9 living in a set of @xmath10 single particle levels ( s.p.l . ) , e.g. in a major shell of the nuclear mean field .",
    "this problem was solved long ago for the case of one s.p.l .",
    "hosting @xmath11 pairs of fermions : yet it still presents aspects deserving further investigation in the non - degenerate case .",
    "actually this is the situation one faces in applying @xmath8 to real systems like nuclei and metals , which in fact represent two extreme situations of the non - degenerate case : in the former a major shell is typically split into five or six s.p.l . of different angular momenta , in the latter",
    "the number of non - degenerate levels entering into a band corresponds to a significant fraction of the avogadro number .",
    "moreover in a heavy nucleus the number of pairs living in a level may be as large as , say , eight while in a metal is one .",
    "recently a renewed and widespread interest for @xmath8 in the non - degenerate frame has flourished in connection with the issues of the physics of ultrasmall metallic grains , possibly superconducting  @xcite , and of bose - einstein condensation  @xcite .    when only one pair in @xmath10 s.p.l",
    ". is considered then the eigenstates of the pairing hamiltonian fall into two classes : one collective and @xmath12 trapped ( in between the s.p.l . )",
    "states . in this connection",
    "it was found in @xcite that :    1 .",
    "the energy @xmath13 of the collective mode is related to the statistical features of the s.p.l .",
    "distribution , in the sense that only few moments of the latter , beyond of course the strength of the pairing interaction , are sufficient to accurately predict @xmath13 ; 2 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) of the states trapped in between the s.p.l . and",
    "hence constrained in the range @xmath16 , being the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) the single particle energies , belong to two different regimes : in the weak coupling regime , for @xmath19 both small and large , the @xmath14 almost coincide with @xmath20 ( the more so , the smaller the degeneracy of the unperturbed s.p.l . is ) , whereas in the strong coupling regime , _ provided the degeneracy of the s.p.l . increases with @xmath19 _ , the @xmath14 , for small @xmath19 , almost coincide with @xmath21 .",
    "notably the transition between the two situations occurs more and more sharply , namely in correspondence of a precise value of the coupling constant @xmath2 , as @xmath10 increases .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the previous analysis considering two pairs of fermions living in many levels .",
    "first we shall see that in this case the eigenstates of the pairing hamiltonian are conveniently classified in terms of a number @xmath0 , which provides a measure of the degree of collectivity of the states .",
    "this number is directly linked to the number @xmath22 , first introduced by gaudin in ref .",
    "@xcite , through the relation @xmath23 and might be considered as a sort of `` like - seniority '' ( hence the notation @xmath0 )   counts the fermions coupled to @xmath24 , the number @xmath0 refers to @xmath9 pairs . ] since it reduces to the standard seniority @xmath1 for large @xmath2 : as pointed out in @xcite , it has the significance of the number of pair energies ( see below ) which remain finite as @xmath2 goes to infinity .",
    "futhermore for the @xmath25 system we address the issues of :    1 .   expressing the energy @xmath13 of the collective @xmath26 state in terms of the statistical features of the s.p.l .",
    "distribution , i.e. in terms of the moments of the latter ; 2 .   exploring the existence and providing an analytic expression of the critical values of @xmath2 ( we already know from @xcite that at most two of them might exist on a s.p.l . ) which signal the transition of the system between two different regimes ; 3 .   relating these values of @xmath6 to the one previously found in the @xmath27 case ; 4 .   studying the transition from the weak coupling ( where the mean field dominates ) to the strong coupling regime ( where the pairing interaction dominates ) by following the behaviour with @xmath2 of the pair transfer matrix elements between one and two pairs states ; 5 .   relating the exact and bcs solution in the quite extreme situation of few pairs ( in fact two ) and few s.p.l .",

    "anticipating our results , we will find that indeed , under suitable conditions , two values of @xmath6 exist .",
    "they turn out to coincide in the large @xmath10 limit and , notably , they coincide as well with the one found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath27 case .",
    "their analytic expression can also be related , as for @xmath13 , to the moments of the distribution of the s.p.l .",
    "( in fact to the inverse of the latter ) and they again mark the transition between the two above mentioned regimes .    indeed for @xmath28 the exact solutions of the richardson equations appear to come very close to the bogoliubov quasi - particle solutions of the reduced bcs and , concerning the one pair transfer matrix element , we display their divergence in the proximity of @xmath6 .",
    "finally we prove that the existence of @xmath6 relates to the trace of @xmath8 .",
    "as well - known the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the pairing hamiltonian @xmath29 @xmath30 being the @xmath9 pair distruction operator , are found by solving the richardson equations @xcite .",

    "since the richardson equations deal with pairs of fermions ( nucleons ) coupled to an angular momentum @xmath9 , their eigenvalues , given by @xmath35 , are those of the zero - seniority states ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "importantly , these eigenvalues display different degrees of collectivity : hence they are conveniently classified in terms of the latter . for this purpose ,",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we introduce a number @xmath0 , that counts in a given state the number of particles prevented to take part into the collectivity , not because they are blind to the pairing interaction ( indeed they are coupled to @xmath9 ) , but because they remain trapped in between the s.p.l .",
    ", even in the strong coupling regime .",
    "specifically we shall ascribe the value @xmath0= 0 to the fully collective state , @xmath0=2 to a state set up with a trapped pair energy while the other displays a collective behaviour and @xmath0=4 to the state with two trapped pair energies .",
    "this classification is equivalent to the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath11 pair energies are split ( for any @xmath11 ) into two classes : those remaining finite as @xmath3 and the others",
    ".    we shall explore this pattern of states in both the weak and the strong coupling regimes , commencing with the former , which is the simpler to deal with .",
    "in the weak coupling limit of course no collective mode develops , hence @xmath0 has no significance . adopting a perturbative treatment we write the pair energies @xmath31 , @xmath32 as @xmath37 ( @xmath38 being a perturbation ) .",
    "hence @xmath39 and , expanding in @xmath2 , the system becomes    1 + -g__1 + + o(g^2)&=&0 + 1 + -g__2 + + o(g^2 ) & = & 0 , [ sistema2bis ]    where the indices @xmath40 and @xmath41 select one configuration out of the unperturbed ones . at the lowest order in @xmath2 , if @xmath42 , one has @xmath43 and the pair energies @xmath44 are real . thus the energy eigenvalue @xmath35 becomes @xmath45 instead , if @xmath46 , entailing @xmath47 , we have to solve the system    1 + -g__1 + + o(g^2)&=0 + 1 + -g__2 + + o(g^2)&=0 .",
    "[ sistema3 ]    a generic solution reads @xmath48 showing that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are always complex conjugate . hence the energy becomes @xmath49 which is of course real .    in comparing and with the lowest energy of one pair , which , in the weak coupling regime , is  @xcite @xmath50 one sees that , while corresponds to the sum of two contributions like ( the two pairs ignore each other ) , in the pauli blocking effect appears .",
    "here is where @xmath0 has a significance and we deal with the states with @xmath26 and @xmath51 ( the @xmath52 states are of minor physical interest ) .      in this subsection",
    "we study the eigenvalue of @xmath26 in the strong coupling limit .",
    "clearly such a state arises from an unperturbed configuration with the two pairs in the lowest s.p.l .",
    "( if @xmath53 ) or in the two lowest s.p.l .",
    "we already know that in the degenerate case the collective eigenvalue is @xmath54 @xmath55 being the energy and @xmath56 the degeneracy of the level .",
    "the above yields the leading order contribution to the energy in the non - degenerate case and represents a good estimate when the spreading of the s.p.e .",
    "levels is small with respect to @xmath57 , as it is natural to expect .    to show this , following @xcite",
    ", we introduce the new variables @xmath58 where now @xmath59    we further define the variance @xmath60 and the skewness @xmath61 of the level distribution ; moreover we introduce the expansion parameter @xmath62 then the system becomes    2+(1 + + + ) + ( 1 + + + ) & = & 0 +   + ( 1 + + + ) - ( 1 + + + ) + & = & 0",
    ". + [ sistema3ter ]    at the leading order the system is easily solved , yielding @xmath63 higher order terms can be obtained through a recursive linearisation procedure .",
    "one gets @xmath64    note that the two pair energies are always complex conjugate .",
    "so the system s total energy reads @xmath65    since the collective energy of one pair of nucleons living in @xmath10 levels in the strong coupling regime is @xcite @xmath66 one sees that , when @xmath67 , becomes just twice the value and , moreover , the imaginary part of @xmath68 and @xmath69 goes to zero as @xmath70 .",
    "thus , in this limit , the pauli interaction between the two pairs vanishes , as expected : the two pairs behave as two free quasi - bosons condensed in a level whose energy is given by ( [ energyn1 ] ) .    in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] we compare the result with the exact one assuming that the two pairs live in the first @xmath10 levels of a harmonic oscillator well with frequency @xmath71 .",

    "( in units of the oscillator frequency the energy of such a configuration is 8) .",
    "we see that the difference between the two results never exceeds @xmath72  15  % , even for @xmath73 as low as 0.1 .",
    "note also that the energy of the @xmath26 state scales with the size of the well ( i.e. it does not depend upon @xmath71 ) .",

    "hence the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for two pairs can be recovered from ours by setting @xmath77 in the formulae of this section .",
    "likewise , our results can be directly derived from ref .",
    "@xcite by setting @xmath11=2 and by grouping the single particle levels into @xmath10 degenerate multiplets .",
    "in this section we first search for the critical values of the coupling constant @xmath2 and for their expression in terms of the moments of the s.p.l . distribution for the @xmath25 system ( subsection [ sec : angcr ] ) .",
    "next , in subsection [ sec : gcr ] , we discuss the physics of @xmath6 .",
    "finally , in subsection [ sec : bcs ] , we compare the richardson solution with the bcs one .      in the weak coupling regime , when a state evolves from an unperturbed one with the two pairs living in the same level , then the pair energies @xmath31 and @xmath32 are always _ complex conjugate_. on the other hand when the state evolves from an unperturbed one having the two pairs living in two different s.p.l .",
    ", then @xmath31 and @xmath32 are _",
    "real_.    by contrast , in the strong coupling regime the pair energies @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the @xmath26 state are always complex conjugate .",
    "it is then clear that , if the degeneracy @xmath78 of the lowest s.p.l . is greater than one , then the pair energies @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the @xmath26 state are complex conjugate in both the weak and strong coupling regime and their behaviour with @xmath2 is smooth .    on the other hand if @xmath79 , since in the weak coupling limit the two pairs must live on different levels , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are necessarily real in a neighbourhood of the origin , but become complex in the strong coupling regime .",
    "thus a singularity in their behaviour as a function of @xmath2 is bound to occur .    in this second case",
    "it appears natural to surmise that the singularity takes place when @xmath31 and @xmath32 coincide .",
    "in fact in this case the pauli term of the richardson equations diverges , and it must be compensated by a divergence in the sum entering into the system ( [ sistema ] ) : this can only happen if @xmath31 or @xmath32 coincides with an unperturbed eigenvalue .    to find out the analytic expression of the critical value of @xmath2 we start from a generic solution with two pair energies @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which evolve with @xmath2 till they coincide at an unperturbed energy @xmath80 of a s.p.l . with degeneracy @xmath81 .",
    "these pair energies must fulfill the @xmath2-independent eq .",
    "( [ sistema2]b ) , that we cast in the form @xmath82 and which allows to express @xmath83 as a function of @xmath84 . to render this relationship explicit we set    [ eq : ab36 ] e_1 & = & 2 e_+x + e_2 & = & 2 e_+x_(x ) ,    where @xmath85 is easily found to read , for vanishing @xmath86 , @xmath87 a real quantity only when @xmath77 .",
    "this occurrence is crucial since , in order to compensate the divergence arising from the sum appearing in ( [ sistema]a ) , namely @xmath88 , the divergent pauli term @xmath89 $ ] must be real .",
    "assuming then @xmath77 , the link between the pair energies is easily found by inserting into and expanding in @xmath86 . to fourth",
    "order in @xmath86 one obtains @xmath90 where @xmath31 is hidden in @xmath86 and the quantities @xmath91 are the inverse moments of the level distribution .    to compute @xmath6 we recast one of the equations of the system",

    "the two solutions of are @xmath94^{-1}~,\\ ] ] which actually correspond to _ two _ critical values for @xmath2 .",
    "we thus recover the results found long ago by richardson  @xcite through a somewhat different route .",
    "the situation is portrayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , where the behaviour of the pair energies with @xmath95 is displayed for a harmonic oscillator well assuming @xmath96 .    clearly in this case the only s.p.l .",
    "with @xmath97 is the lowest one , hence the pair energies @xmath31 and @xmath32 , real in the weak coupling limit , coincide at the critical point @xmath98 ( their common value being @xmath99 ) and then become complex conjugate ; the energy of the associated state evolves in the @xmath26 collective mode .",
    "by contrast , for the @xmath100 state , arising from the configuration with two pairs living on the second level ( which is allowed for the harmonic oscillator well ) , the two pair energies @xmath31 and @xmath32 are complex conjugate in the weak coupling limit , coalesce into the energy @xmath99 at the critical point @xmath101 and then become real .",
    "one of the two solutions remains trapped above @xmath99 , while the other evolves into a collective state : the sum of the two yields the energy of the @xmath100 state .",
    "it is thus plain that for the occurrence of a critical value of @xmath2 a s.p.l .",
    "with @xmath97 must exist .",
    "such s.p.l .",
    "is the lowest one in a harmonic oscillator , hence for this potential well both the ground and the first excited state of a @xmath25 system carry one critical value of the coupling constant , namely @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively . in correspondence of these",
    "the pair energies take on the value @xmath104 .",
    "thus for a @xmath25 system two ( at most ) critical points exist on a @xmath97 s.p.l .",
    "finally , owing to the relevance of the @xmath97 degeneracy , we consider the model of @xmath10 , for simplicity equally spaced , s.p.l .",
    "all having @xmath97 , a situation occurring in metals and in deformed nuclei . in this instance two",
    "positive @xmath6 always exist in the lowest s.p.l . when @xmath105 ( in fact @xmath106 for @xmath107 )",
    ". moreover a positive @xmath103 implies complex @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath108 and since for small @xmath2 both the pair energies are real , they should evolve from an unperturbed configuration connected with the next higher lying s.p.l .",
    ", as illustrated in fig.[fig:4 ] .",
    "numerically we have found , for this model , that two @xmath6 appear on the second level when @xmath109 and on the third level when @xmath110 .",
    "thus in the @xmath97 model for two pairs to form , so to speak , a _ quartet _",
    "it is necessary that they live on adjacent s.p.l . in the unperturbed configuration .",
    "furthermore the more excited the configuration is the more not only @xmath2 , but @xmath10 as well , should be larger for the merging to occur , a fact clearly reflecting the competition between the mean field and the pairing force . finally observe that here , at variance with the finding of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath111 : this is simply because we measure the s.p.e . from the bottom of the well rather than from the fermi surface .      in [ sec : angcr ] we have found that , when a s.p.l . with a degeneracy @xmath97 exists ,",
    "at least two states of the @xmath25 system carry a critical value @xmath6 .",
    "it is then natural to ask what is the relationship of the latter with the @xmath6 found in @xcite where a system with @xmath27 was addressed .",
    "actually in @xcite @xmath6 marked the transition from a mean field dominated regime to the one ruled by the pairing interaction ( as far as the trapped states are concerned ) .",
    "moreover , in @xcite we have proved the existence of @xmath6 for any potential well with s.p.l . of increasing degeneracy .    to connect the values of @xmath6 for the systems with @xmath27 and @xmath25 ,",
    "respectively , we consider again the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "for this well , in the @xmath27 case , by explicitly computing the variance and the total degeneracy of the levels , the critical value of @xmath2 , in units of @xmath112 , is @xmath113 when @xmath10 is large . for the @xmath25 system",
    "first notice that , at large @xmath10 , in @xmath114 the moment @xmath115 dominates over @xmath116 : hence , in this condition , @xmath117 moreover , again for @xmath10 large enough , @xmath118 from where the equality @xmath119 follows in the asymptotic @xmath10 limit . from this outcome",
    "it follows that also when @xmath25 the relevant dynamical element for @xmath120 is the mean field , whereas for @xmath121 is the pairing force , as far as the system s ground state is concerned .",
    "one might ask how this interpretation can be reconciled with the findings related to the potential well of equally spaced s.p.l . with @xmath97 ,",
    "for which no @xmath6 occurs in the @xmath27 system , whereas a @xmath122 does exist in the @xmath25 system .    to understand this occurrence",
    "consider the structure of the trace of @xmath8 .",
    "this , in fact , for the @xmath27 system and _ as far as the trapped modes are concerned _ is found , in the strong coupling limit , to read @xmath123 where @xmath124 actually measures the shift of each trapped pair energy @xmath125 @xmath126 from the corresponding unperturbed energy @xmath127 .",
    "the above holds for any well with @xmath10 ( large ) equally spaced s.p.l . with degeneracy @xmath128",
    "we thus see that ( [ eq : sigg ] ) yields @xmath129 for the harmonic oscillator ( @xmath130 ) and @xmath131 for the @xmath97 model ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "hence for the latter the pairing force is so strongly active among the trapped pair energies to prevent the occurrence of a transition from the pairing to the mean field dominated physics , whereas the opposite happens for the harmonic oscillator well .",
    "in addition the trace of @xmath8 entails that in the @xmath97 model the collective mode is weaker than in the harmonic oscillator case : indeed to set it up not only a strong @xmath2 , but a large degeneracy as well , is needed .    concerning the @xmath25 case in the @xmath97 model , the pairing dominance regime , defined by @xmath7 ,",
    "is indeed postponed at values of @xmath2 larger than in the harmonic oscillator case .",
    "in fact one deduces from , in the large @xmath10 limit , the expression @xmath133 which , _ en passant _ , fixes the domain of validity of the perturbative expansion in @xmath2  @xcite for the @xmath97 model .",
    "one might accordingly conjecture that no transition between different regimes will occur in this case among the trapped energies : we are currently performing the analysis of the behavior of the @xmath134 versus @xmath2 for the @xmath100 states to ascertain whether this statement holds true .      in this section",
    "we compare the exact solutions of the richardson equations with the bcs solution in terms of bogoliubov quasi - particles .",

    "as it happens for the @xmath27 system , is an issue we are currently investigating .",
    "be as it may , we have explored in detail the transition associated to @xmath264 and @xmath265 by following the behaviour with @xmath2 of both the excitation energies of the @xmath100 and @xmath52 states and of the pair transfer matrix elements , finding for the latter a most conspicuous enhancement ( the more so , the larger @xmath10 ) in the proximity of @xmath6 , clearly reflecting the onset of an odlro in the system . concerning the excitation energies we have found that they closely approach the bcs predictions at large @xmath2 especially for the case of two quasi - particle ( @xmath100 ) excitations , notwithstanding that the latter , in the bcs picture , amounts to break a pair",

    "the anderson s criterion  @xcite for superconductivity is thus fulfilled . indeed in the ground state",
    "our system can be viewed as four fermions ( a `` quartet '' ) sitting on the same energy level .",
    "in this appendix we shortly provide analytic expressions for the normalisation constants , whenever this is possible .",
    "when both the pair energies are real no simple formulas for the normalisation coefficients @xmath269 are available , whereas when @xmath270 one can use eq . to get @xmath271        in the latter case the normalisation is known , but , to get @xmath229 , we need to define @xmath275 where , unlike in , no absolute values appear . thus the @xmath276 are complex and @xmath277 . with the help of , and using ,",
