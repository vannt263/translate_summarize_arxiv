    "there is considerable interest in diffractive electroproduction of @xmath2 mesons off protons at high energies because this process is important for studying the gluon density in a proton at low values of bjorken x. this interest stems from the simplicity of the leading order qcd expression for longitudinally polarized photons which was first derived by ryskin @xcite , [ one ] @xmath3 ^ 2\\ ] ] where , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the @xmath2 mass , and @xmath6 is the decay width into leptons .",
    "the above equation was derived under the assumptions of @xmath7 , and that fermi motion of the quarks in the meson can be entirely neglected .",
    "it was further supposed that the gluon density appearing in eq.[one ] is that which would be measured in some inclusive hard process , i.e. that it corresponds to the matrix element of gluon operators between states of equal momentum .    in this paper",
    "we shall examine the effect of relaxing two assumptions which go into eq.[one ] .",
    "the first is to take into account the correction arising from the fermi motion of the @xmath8 pair . in the work of brodsky et al@xcite this motion",
    "is contained in the vector meson light - cone wavefunction @xmath9 , a quantity which is in principle calculable from lattice qcd but whose presently unknown form is an important source of ambiguity .",
    "for example , frankfurt et al@xcite conclude that wavefunction effects suppress @xmath2 production by a factor of 3 or more .",
    "however ryskin et al@xcite estimate a suppression factor of @xmath10 .",
    "the detailed shape of the wavefunction appears to be an important source of the difference .",
    "the method of treating the diffractive process , as well as fermi motion corrections , used in this paper differs from previously used methods in an essential way . rather than work in the infinite momentum frame and in the @xmath11 gauge",
    ", we shall choose the rest frame of the @xmath2 and the coulomb gauge for the soft gluons in the meson wavefunction .",
    "this is the natural choice for heavy - quark systems because one can then use systematic procedures , such as non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics@xcite ( nrqcd ) or the method developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in order to evaluate quarkonium observables of interest to any desired level of accuracy .",
    "however , for the gluons in the fast moving proton we shall continue to use the @xmath11 gauge because this is the natural gauge to use for parton distributions .",
    "the two kinds of gluons have very different momenta and hence are effectively distinguishable , justifying the use of two different gauges in two different parts of the same feynman diagram .",
    "it turns out that a gauge - invariant correction factor , derived in this paper , multiplies eq.1 , @xmath12 the second derivative of the wavefunction is understood to be evaluated at the origin .",
    "it is a non - perturbative quantity whose value has to be inferred from some other quarkonium processes , such as decays or production , involving large momentum transfer . in previous work@xcite",
    "its value was estimated , @xmath13 the correction factor due to fermi motion is therefore around @xmath14 , a value considerably below the other estimates@xcite .",
    "hence , the ambiguity in extracting the normalization of the gluon distribution may be under better control than anticipated so far .",
    "the second issue to be considered in this paper is the gluon distribution which appears in eq.1 .",
    "recently ji@xcite identified certain twist - two `` off - forward '' quark distributions inside the proton which , when measured , will reveal the orbital angular momentum content of the proton . subsequently radyushkin@xcite extended the discussion to the off - forward or `` asymmetric '' gluon distribution in the proton and pointed out that diffractive vector meson electroproduction necessarily measures this quantity . here",
    "we have examined this issue further by considering gluon radiation from a quark and explicitly computed the off - forward gluon distribution in a quark to leading order in @xmath15 .",
    "this enables an estimate to be made of the extent to which the gluon distribution measured in @xmath2 diffractive production differs from that which would be measured in some inclusive process like @xmath16",
    "we consider a massless proton target and the @xmath17 limit .",
    "define two null vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xmath18 is also the proton s momentum .",
    "although we shall not need to do so explicitly , @xmath23 can be adjusted to bring the produced @xmath2 to rest .",
    "the kinematic region of interest is considered to be @xmath24 . with the definitions ,",
    "@xmath25 the other momenta in fig.1 are , @xmath26 the polarization vectors of the longitudinally polarized photon and @xmath2 are , respectively , @xmath27 these obey @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "we have kept only leading terms and set @xmath33 .      the leading order contribution to @xmath2 diffractive production",
    "is given by the sum of the diagrams shown in fig.2 , to which must be added the contribution of two other diagrams that give the same numerical values because of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "consider , by way of example , the first of these which has the expression , @xmath34 ,   \\nonumber   \\label{amp } \\\\",
    "h_1^{\\mu \\nu } ( k,\\ell ) & = & e_q\\ g^2\\;\\gamma ^\\mu s_f(k+q - k/2+\\ell )",
    "\\gamma ^\\nu s_f(q - k/2+\\ell ) { \\not \\!\\epsilon ( q)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the perturbative part @xmath35 is different for the other diagram but the other factors in eq.[amp ] remain unchanged .",
    "we have not indicated colour explicitly in the above ; its inclusion will amount to a simple factor which will be inserted at the end of the calculation .",
    "the non - perturbative information of the vector meson is contained in the bethe - salpeter wavefunction @xmath36 , @xmath37|0\\rangle .",
    "\\label{bs}\\ ] ] in the above , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are , respectively , the relative momentum and relative distance of the @xmath8 pair .",
    "the non - perturbative information of the gluons in the proton is contained in @xmath40 , @xmath41|p\\rangle\\ ] ] while the diagrams in fig.2 contain the leading order contribution to the cross - section , they also contain parts which are next to leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "the sense in which these are to be understood as `` higher order '' will be made precise later .",
    "other diagrams will have to be included ( see fig.3 ) for a complete calculation at the nlo level .",
    "the diffractive process considered here has two large scales , @xmath42 .",
    "since a @xmath8 system is close to being a non - relativistic coulombic bound - state , it allows for an expansion in powers of the heavy quark relative velocity .",
    "hence it is useful to expand the inner integral in eq.[amp ] , @xmath43 where , @xmath44|0\\rangle \\mid _ { x=0 }   \\label{m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the set of constants @xmath45 provide a description equivalent to that of the original bs wavefunction in eq.[bs ] .",
    "the expansion eq.[exp ] is useful because the quarks are nearly on mass - shell : @xmath46 implies that all components of @xmath38 are small relative to the quark mass @xmath47 in the meson s rest frame and , in particular , @xmath48 . in the large @xmath49 limit",
    "this implies considerable simplification , giving a limit approximately independent of @xmath50 , @xmath51 inclusion of fermi motion requires that we keep a sufficient number of derivatives w.r.t @xmath50 in eq.[exp ] .",
    "these may be computed using the simple ward identity , @xmath52 and the @xmath53 limit should be taken after performing the trace algebra .",
    "stated in words , a differentiation of either propagator in eq.[amp ] w.r.t @xmath50 splits that propagator into two . since we shall work upto @xmath54v@xmath55 ,",
    "only two derivatives of @xmath35 are needed .",
    "it is obvious from the occurence of the ordinary derivatives in eq.[m ] , or the form of the bs wavefunction eq.[bs ] , that gauge invariance has been violated . in earlier work on quarkonium",
    "processes@xcite we have encountered an identical situation  the diagrams in fig.2 yield expressions which are not gauge invariant to @xmath54v@xmath55 and one needs to consider additional diagrams , which are higher order in @xmath15 .",
    "these are shown in fig.3 .",
    "the gluon fields indicated in these diagrams combine with the ordinary derivatives to yield covariant derivatives , @xmath56 thereby restoring gauge invariance . in the coulomb gauge ,",
    "the contribution of explicit gluons is @xmath54v@xmath57 and so the reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation performed in ref.@xcite without explicit gluons is adequate upto @xmath54v@xmath55 .",
    "we therefore arrive at the following gauge - invariant matrix elements : @xmath58 in the above , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the non - relativistic wavefunction and its second derivative evaluated at zero separation .",
    "inclusion of @xmath60 amounts to taking the first step towards inclusion of fermi motion .",
    "all the ingredients are now in place for calculating the trace of the quark loops .",
    "because we shall need only the leading twist piece , symmetric in @xmath61 and @xmath62 , it will be sufficient to calculate , @xmath63\\ ] ] for @xmath64 ( n is the order of differentiation w.r.t @xmath50 ) and then keep only the leading order term in @xmath65 .",
    "we record below the results of the calculation listing , for clarity , the relative contribution of only those diagrams which give a non - zero contribution , @xmath66 the factor of 2 multiplying the brackets in the above equations comes from the diagrams which are permutations of the ones shown .",
    "the sum over all diagrams is , @xmath67 note that this leading order contribution is in fact independent of the gluon momentum @xmath68 in the @xmath53 limit .",
    "the term in the brackets represents the correction due to the fermi - motion of the heavy quarks and its square is precisely the factor which modifies eq.1 .",
    "let us now return to the amplitude for diffractive scattering , a typical contribution to which is given by eq.[amp ] .",
    "the photon and proton both move along the @xmath69 direction , and the gluons in the proton have limited @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this means that one can perform a systematic collinear expansion in these quantities just as in the treatment of deep - inelastic scattering@xcite , @xmath72 keeping only the first , leading twist , term gives in the @xmath11 gauge , @xmath73|p\\rangle \\;h^{\\mu \\nu } ( y,\\ell )   \\label{ccc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above we have set @xmath74 and @xmath75 the time ordering operation becomes irrelevant on the light - cone .",
    "the inner integral will now be analyzed following the discussion given by radyushkin@xcite .",
    "define the `` asymmetric distribution function '' , @xmath76 as below , @xmath77|p\\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\ \\ & = & \\frac 12\\bar u(p^{\\prime } ) { \\!}{\\!}n\\,u(p)\\int\\limits_0 ^ 1dx\\;\\left\\ { e^{i\\lambda ( x-\\xi /2)}+e^{-i\\lambda ( x-\\xi /2)}\\right\\ } f_\\xi ( x ) \\label{def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a sum over transverse components ( @xmath78 is implied .",

    "it is instructive to insert a complete set of states for @xmath82 , @xmath83 here @xmath84 with @xmath85 is the momentum fraction carried by the intermediate state . comparing with the usual ( diagonal ) gluon distribution function for @xmath86 it immediately follows that , @xmath87    we shall now relate the matrix element in eq.[ccc ] to @xmath88 inverting the relation @xmath89 gives , @xmath90 inserting the above into eq.[ccc ] and using the definition of @xmath91 in eq.[def ] , @xmath92 the imaginary part of the above for @xmath93 is @xmath94 and hence , @xmath95=-\\frac",

    "this identification was motivated by eq.[usual ] but the exact relation between @xmath103 and @xmath104 is far from clear .",
    "@xmath103 and @xmath104 can be known only if the non - perturbative structure of the proton state is known .",
    "however , it would be highly desirable to have at least some partial knowledge of their structure .",
    "to this end ,",
    "consider the following simple solvable problem : imagine that the target proton is replaced by a single quark which can radiate a gluon .",
    "its light - cone wavefunction can be computed order by order in perturbation theory , and the leading order matrix element is , @xmath105 where @xmath106 are the momenta and transverse polarizations of the emitted gluon . using , @xmath107 and summing over @xmath108 gives , @xmath109 inserting this into eq.[sum ] yields , @xmath110 the last integral is both infrared and ultraviolet divergent .",
    "it is regulated by inserting a low momentum scale cutoff @xmath111 and a high momentum cutoff @xmath112 multiplying by the colour factor @xmath113 @xmath114 , we arrive at the perturbative _ asymmetric _ gluon distribution inside a quark , @xmath115 note that , @xmath116 but that the usual perturbative _ symmetric _ distribution , which can also be obtained by first putting @xmath86 in eq.[f ] and then setting @xmath117 is , @xmath118 comparison of the last two formulae gives an estimate of the extent to which the asymmetric distribution departs from the symmetric one as @xmath119 becomes larger .    finally , we remark that there exists some confusion in the literature about various factors of two and four .",
    "first , it is claimed in the work of brodsky et al@xcite that the cross - section displayed in eq.1 must be multiplied by @xmath120 .",
    "we do not find this to be the case ; the result of ryskin@xcite appears to be correct .",
    "this point has been corroborated in ref.@xcite .",
    "a second possible point of confusion concerning the relation between @xmath91 and the usual gluon distribution @xmath104 has also now been resolved following the corrected definition ( which i have used in the final version of this paper ) of @xmath91 in ref.@xcite .",
