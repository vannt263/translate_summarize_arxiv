    "a recent work has studied the global structure of ownership network with respect to the issue of the corporate control @xcite . in this paper , instead , we carry out an in - depth community analysis @xcite of the same network , in order to address questions concerning the level of geographical integration and the role of the financial sector in the global economy .",
    "an economic network is a structure in which some economic entities , represented as nodes , are connected to some other entities by means of one or more specific types of relationships .",
    "previous empirical studies in socio - economic networks , that are relevant for our work , include those focusing on : international trade @xcite , international financial exposures @xcite , financial networks @xcite more in detail , regarding corporate governance , there are two main groups of works : ( i ) those on corporate boards , e.g. , interlocking directorates @xcite , and those on firm ownership @xcite .",
    "however , in these disciplines little attention has been devoted to the community structure .",
    "apart from the study of @xcite , which analyzes the community structure of two small networks , the italian board and ownership networks , the other community analyses have focused on correlation networks in stock markets @xcite and in foreign exchange markets @xcite .",
    "the study of the transnational corporation ( tnc ) ownership network reveals that corporations are well connected , with the large majority of the nodes belonging to a large connected component , which is itself organized in several communities .",
    "the community analysis is performed by applying the method of @xcite that belongs to the optimization class and is one of the few algorithms suitable for the investigation of large networks with no imposed constraints on the number of communities @xcite . in order to asses the robustness of the resulting community partitions ,",
    "we have compared the community structure in the empirical network with the one obtained from a random link formation process , accounting for the constraints on the degree distribution and on the ownership structure @xcite .",
    "the comparison reveals that for the rewired networks the community structure is quite homogeneous across realizations and it differs considerably from the one of the empirical network , meaning that the community structure can not be considered the result of a random pattern of link formation .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the geographical and sector properties of the communities reveals that , while both features characterize the communities , the country dominance tends to be more pronounced than the sector dominance . finally , we consider communities as themselves forming a network , in which the link between any two given communities reflects the number of ownership relations among firms from the two communities .",
    "we assess the importance of each community in the network by using debtrank , a centrality measure recently introduced in the complex systems literature in the context of economic networks @xcite .",
    "in particular , we apply this method to investigate the role played by the financial sector as a source of the connections among communities .",
    "we find that the community centrality changes drastically when we exclude from the sample the firms belonging to the financial sector .",
    "the difference in centrality quantifies the role played by the financial sector in the strength of the links among communities and , thus , in determining the potential impact that each community has on the others .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : data ] we present the database , the cleaning procedure we have performed , and we provide the basic network notions . in section  [ sec : community analysis ] we introduce the community analysis and the community network is also studied .",
    "section  [ sec : role_fin_sector ] investigates the role played by the financial sector in the ownership community network and , finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "the dataset we investigate in this paper is the same that was analyzed in  @xcite and extracted , by means of the procedure explained in the following , from the orbis 2007 database  ] containing information as of the last quarter of 2007 for more than 30 million economic actors ( firms and shareholders ) .",
    "it includes the name of firms , their geographical localization ( country and city ) , industrial classification ( nace ) and several financial data .",
    "moreover , the database includes data on about 12 million ownership relations , with information on the name of the shareholder and the amount of shares .",
    "the procedure of extraction is an important part of the methods and it works as follows .",
    "we first identify all the transnational corporations ( tnc ) , defined as those companies that are headquartered in one country and operate in at least one foreign country , by owning partially , at least 10% of the shares , or wholly other companies  @xcite .",
    "we obtain a list of 43060 tncs , located in 115 different countries .",
    "the major part of these tncs have their headquarters in europe and the us . nevertheless , some of them are also located in off - shore countries like bermuda ( with 139 companies ) and cayman islands ( with 40 companies ) .",
    "then , we explore recursively the neighborhood of the tnc companies in the whole database .",
    "two recursive searches are applied : ( i ) we proceed downstream by identifying all the participated companies directly and indirectly owned by the tncs with a breadth - first search procedure ; ( ii ) we proceed upstream with the same procedure in order to find the shareholders that have direct and indirect paths leading to the tncs . in this way",
    ", we assemble a network in which each node is connected to at least one tnc .",
    "the resulting network consists of 600508 nodes corresponding to economic entities and 1006987 links corresponding to corporate ownership relations .    in an ownership network",
    ", the nodes correspond to economic entities ( e.g. , companies or people owning equity shares ) and the links to ownership relationships connecting them .",
    "we recall that a network @xmath0 is defined as the set of nodes @xmath1 and the set @xmath2 of edges represented by ordered pairs of nodes @xmath3 , with @xmath4 being the source and @xmath5 the target nodes of the edge @xmath6 .",
    "the weighted adjacency matrix of the network is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the share that @xmath9 owns in @xmath10 .",
    "the network does not contain self - loops and the sum of shares of a firm held by other entities can not exceed 100% , i.e. , @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "the in - degree , @xmath14 , is the number of incoming links to a node @xmath9 , that is , according to the convention we follow here , the number of shareholders .",
    "the out - degree , @xmath15 , refers , instead , to the number of node @xmath9 s outgoing links and represents the number of firms in @xmath9 s portfolio .",
    "a connected component is a subgraph in which all the nodes can reach all the other nodes via an undirected path .",
    "in the field of complex networks , the notion of `` community '' corresponds , loosely speaking , to a subset of nodes that are more densely connected among themselves than with the nodes outside the subset .",
    "several definitions of community and methods to detect communities have been proposed in the literature ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "most algorithms can be distinguished in divisive @xcite , agglomerative @xcite and optimization - based @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the goodness of the partitions is commonly assessed in terms of the so - called `` modularity '' @xcite , defined as follows : @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the total number of links and @xmath18 is the total degree ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the modularity takes values between @xmath20 and @xmath21 and compares the density of the links within the communities with those across communities .",
    "positive values of modularity are a necessary but not sufficient condition for the presence of communities , since even random graphs can have positive values .",
    "therefore , the values obtained have to be compared with those obtained in ensembles of rewired networks ( see more below ) .",
    "however , since the detection methods mentioned above suffer from certain shortcomings , in this study , we apply the method of @xcite , that belongs to the optimization class and is one of the few algorithms that , at the same time , are suitable : ( i ) to analyze large networks and ( ii ) to avoid _ ex - ante _",
    "assumptions on the number of communities to be detected or on their size @xcite .",
    "the algorithm works in successive stages . in the first stage ,",
    "each node is assigned to a different community and , then , they are moved to the community of their neighbors if the new location increases the modularity .",
    "this process is applied to all nodes repeatedly and it ends when no more gains could be achieved . in the second and in each further stage , the communities previously found are treated as the node of a new network .",
    "the links between two communities are defined as the sum of the links between pairs of nodes belonging , each , to one of the two communities . for a detailed description of the algorithm ,",
    "see ( see * ? ? ?",
    "further , we want to compare the community structure in the empirical network with the one resulting from a random link formation process . in order to account for constraints that arise from the degree distribution ,",
    "it is custom to generate ensembles of synthetic networks by applying a degree - preserving rewiring procedure @xcite . when rewiring the links in an ownership network , it is important to satisfy two main constraints : ( i ) the degree sequence , i.e. , the number of outgoing and ingoing links of each economic entity ; and ( ii ) the total number of ownership shares owned by the shareholders .",
    "we , thus , follow the procedure described in @xcite ( leaving out the additional constraint on the geographical location of firms and shareholders ) to generate 20 realizations of synthetic rewired networks .",
    "the tnc ownership network is composed of 23825 connected components .",
    "the largest component contains 463006 nodes ( 77% of the total ) , while the second largest connected component contains 230 nodes and 90% of the components have less than 10 nodes .",
    "we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : distr ] ( left side ) the distribution of the component size .",
    "notice how the data point corresponding to the largest component deviates from the trend of all the other components .",
    "a power law fit of the data points excluding the largest component is shown for reference , yielding an exponent of 2.13 .    in the following",
    "we have restricted our community analysis to the largest connected component ( lcc ) . for the community analysis",
    ", we have utilized the unweighted version of the algorithm for the following reason .",
    "the weight of the links represent a share and , thus , a number between 0 and 1 .",
    "the weight of edges pointing to big firms are typically small since no single shareholder is able to own or interested in owning a large fraction the capital .",
    "therefore , assigning an importance to the links proportional to the share would result in treating shareholding relations to large firms as very weak links , inducing a bias in the communities towards small firms .",
    "a more appropriate way to proceed could be to try to account for the monetary value of the links , which depends on the value of the firm owned .",
    "however , this value is not available in the database for all the firms .",
    "moreover , it would not be clear how to normalize the values in order to use them within the algorithm .",
    "( right side ) decumulative distribution function of the size of the communities in the empirical ( in red ) and reshuffled ( in blue scale ) networks.,title=\"fig : \" ]   is shown .",
    "( right side ) decumulative distribution function of the size of the communities in the empirical ( in red ) and reshuffled ( in blue scale ) networks.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in our empirical network , the algorithm stops the procedure of modularity optimization after seven stages . in tab .",
    "[ tab : community_size ] we report for each stage : ( i ) the number of communities , ( ii ) the number of links , and ( iii ) the level of modularity .",
    "notice that the number of communities decreases from 463006 ( equal to the total number of nodes ) to 6824 .",
    "the number of links among communities decreases from 887515 to 25588 , while the modularity increases from 0.0002 to 0.7344 .",
    "communities are very heterogeneous in size , ranging from those with only few nodes to the two main communities with about 50 thousands nodes .",
    "the @xmath22 of the communities contains less than 1000 nodes and @xmath23 less than 100 .",
    "the distribution is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : distr ] , right side , in red .",
    ".summary of the algorithm output of each community detection phase . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , in order to assess the relative importance of each community we use debtrank , a centrality measure recently introduced in complex networks literature in the context of economic networks @xcite . beyond the interpretation in terms of economic loss due the distress of one or more nodes in the network ,",
    "debtrank can be used as a measure of importance , once a network of impact is defined . here",
    ", we define the impact of community @xmath9 over @xmath10 as the ratio between the number of investments of community @xmath10 into @xmath9 over the number of investments within community @xmath10= @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a rescaling factor that for visualization purposes we set equal to the number of nodes in the network under observation , @xmath26 .",
    "notice that we are not interested in carrying out a stress - test .",
    "we only aim to compare the importance of the communities in the case with and without the financial sector .",
    "traditional measures of centrality are not well suited for this purpose . for instance , eigenvector centrality is defined only on strongly connected graphs , or equivalently on undirected graphs . other measures of impact , e.g. , @xcite , require a normalization of the impact matrix which then prevents from making an absolute comparison of the importance of a given node across different networks ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "[ fig : communities_debtrank ] , left side , illustrates the network of the top 50 communities in a diagram where the position of each community reflects its centrality , as measured by debtrank .",
    "more central communities are located in the center of the diagram .",
    "the size of each node is proportional to the number of firms in the community , the color corresponds to the dominant sector , while the label indicates the dominant country .",
    "as we can expect , the top communities by size are also more central .",
    "[ fig : communities_debtrank ] , right side , illustrates the network of the top 50 communities after removing the firms in the financial sector . in this case , the top communities lose much of their centrality . as we can see , while the topological properties that do not account for the weight of the links are only moderately affected by the removal of the financial sector , the centrality computed with debtrank , which do take weights into account , changes drastically .",
    "the difference in centrality quantifies the role played by the financial sector in the strength of the links among communities and , thus , in determining the potential impact that each community has on the others .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the community structure of the global corporate network , i.e. the network of ownership among transnational corporations .",
    "this network is obtained from a large database of corporate information with a snowball procedure that starts from a list of about 43 thousand transnational corporations and recursively explores all the incoming and outgoing ownership relations .",
    "we have found that the organization in communities is pronounced and can not be explained by randomness .",
    "moreover , most communities are characterized by a dominant country , in the sense that the fraction of firms belonging to that country are not only the ( relative ) majority , but are over - expressed with respect to what would happen if the nationality is distributed at random among the firms .",
    "the characterization in terms of sectors is significant , but less pronounced than the one for countries .",
    "thus , we conclude that the global corporate network is strongly clustered in communities , where geography is the major driver while sector is not so important .",
    "we have also analysed the network in which nodes are the communities and links are obtained aggregating the links among the firms belonging to pairs of communities . in order to assess the role of the financial sector in the architecture of the global corporate network , we have analysed the centrality of the top 50 communities by means of the debtrank algorithm .",
    "this has allowed us to obtain an absolute ( as opposed to relative ) measure of the importance of each community , which we have then used to compare the case with and without the firms in the financial sector .",
    "the difference between these two cases has provided a first quantitative assessment of the role of the financial sector in connecting the global economy .",
