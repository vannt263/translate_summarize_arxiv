    "forty years of research on the broad line regions ( blrs ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has not yielded a clear picture of the structures and detailed physical conditions involved in setting the observed line profiles and strengths .",
    "our current understanding involves contributions from an outflowing , likely clumpy , magnetohydrodynamically or line - driven wind , and an accretion disk ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "the blr is photoionized and must intercept at least 10% of the radiation from the central engine to produce lines of the observed strengths .",
    "if the accretion disk contributes to the blr emission from agn , we expect to see a clear signature of this contribution in the form of a double - peaked line profile , distorted by the effects of doppler boosting and gravitational redshift .",
    "about 3% of optically selected agn have h@xmath0 lines with the characteristic double - peaked shape consistent with accretion - disk emission ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s03 ) . among broad - line radio galaxies",
    "this fraction is up to 20% ( * ? ? ? * hereafter e03 ) , suggesting that balmer - line accretion - disk emission is more prevalent among agn with jets and lower luminosities / accretion rates .    as a class",
    "double - peaked emitters are characterized by broader balmer lines ( up to 40,000kms@xmath1 full width at half maximum [ fwhm ] ) , similar uv / optical luminosities to those of other agn in the same redshift range , and a higher incidence of liner characteristics  for example , larger low - ionization line ratios and low - ionization line equivalent widths ( [ oi]6300/[oiii]5007 , [ sii]ews , etc . ;",
    "e03 , s03 ) .",
    "@xcite report the black - hole masses of 8 double - peaked emitters based on the stellar velocity dispersions of their host - galaxy bulges and find that the accretion rates as a function of eddington vary considerably even in this small sample , with @xmath2 .",
    "uv observations of double - peaked emitters often show single - peaked high - ionization lines ( e.g. ciii ] , civ , ly@xmath0 ; ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) 1996 ) , and are likely dominated by emission from the outflowing blr component .",
    "axisymmetric accretion - disk fits to the h@xmath0 line profiles of about 3 dozen objects from the e03 and s03 samples constrain the accretion - disk line emission to originate between a few hundred and a few thousand @xmath3 ( gravitational radii ) from the center .",
    "the outer radii of emission , typically @xmath4@xmath3 , are consistent with the onset of disk self gravity .",
    "the disk inclinations range between ( from the accretion - disk axis ) , with the inclination distribution suggestive of the presence of coplanar obscuration , whose probability becomes exponentially higher for large inclinations .",
    "this is consistent with clumpy unification models ( see the elitzur , sturm , and hao contributions in this volume ) .",
    "@xcite [ s06 ] studied the x - ray emission of 39 double - peaked emitters , serendipitously detected in _ rosat _ ( 22/39 ) , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "as a class the double - peaked emitters showed similar uv / optical - to - x - ray ratios ( @xmath5 $ ] ) and x - ray power - law spectral indices to other broad - line agn . in practically all cases",
    "( see fig .",
    "3b ) a comparison of the h@xmath0 emission strength with the viscous power available locally from the accretion disk supports the need for external illumination of the disk to produce lines of the observed strength .",
    "our _ chandra_(5/16)/_swift_(11/16 ) sample consists of the 16 double - peaked emitters with the broadest balmer lines ( fwhm@xmath6kms@xmath1 ) ever observed .",
    "the balmer - line emission in these agn originates from the immediate vicinity of the black hole , immediately adjacent to the region responsible for the x - ray emission and the external illumination .",
    "1 shows the optical and x - ray spectra of two radio - quiet [ rq ] double - peaked emitters . despite their comparable 4200",
    "luminosities their x - ray spectra are strikingly different  with large cold absorption modifying the power - law emission in one case , but not in the other ( @xmath7@xmath8 and @xmath9@xmath8 for the top and bottom spectra , respectively ) . half of the _ chandra_/_swift _",
    "sample objects show intrinsic x - ray absorption .    the x - ray power - law spectral indices of extremely broad double - peaked emitters are similar to those of other double - peaked emitters and normal agn with comparable radio - loudness .",
    "unlike the general sample of double - peaked emitters , however , the broadest balmer - line double - peaked emitters appear brighter relative to other agn with comparable uv emission ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "2b we quantify this difference by comparing the @xmath10 residual distributions residuals are obtained by subtracting the @xmath10 dependence on luminosity measured by @xcite for rq agn , @xmath11 + 2.638 $ ] , from the measured @xmath10 . ] for rq and radio - loud [ rl ] double - peaked emitters to those of normal sdss agn with comparable luminosities .",
    "rl agn are brighter in the than similar uv luminosity rq agn regardless of their balmer - line shapes ( i.e. they have larger @xmath10 residuals ) . after the addition of the broadest balmer - line double - peaked emitters to the objects in s06",
    ", we now find a statistically significant difference ( 99% ) for the rq double - peaked emitters , which are also x - ray brighter .",
    "3a shows the x - ray absorbing - gas column vs. the hydrogen column estimated based on the optical reddening ( via the narrow line region [ nlr ] balmer - line decrements ) . in a handful of double - peaked emitters ( those close to the dashed line in fig .",
    "3a ) the observations are consistent with a single absorber with gas - to - dust ratio similar to that of the interstellar medium in our galaxy ( e.g. the agn host galaxy ) . in at least 3 cases",
    "the x - ray absorbing column is much higher , possibly indicating a dust - free or a partial absorber on scales much smaller than the nlr .",
