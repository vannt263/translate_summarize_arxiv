    "recently regularity results for integro - differential equations have been investigated by many authors : we provide below some references but the list is by no means complete . in particular ,",
    "hlder estimates for viscosity solutions of a large class of elliptic and parabolic nonlinear integro - differential equations are obtained in @xcite , by the classical ishii - lions s method .",
    "the aim of this article is twofold : on one hand , we extend these results to provide lipschitz estimates in a similar framework and , on the other hand , we deal with a new class of nonlocal equations that we call _ mixed integro - differential equations _ for which we also give complementary hlder estimates .",
    "the simplest example of such mixed integro - differential equations is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 denotes the fractional laplacian with respect to the @xmath4-variables @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the unit ball in @xmath7 .",
    "in this case local diffusions occur only in the @xmath8-directions and fractional diffusions in the @xmath4-directions .    to be more specific about our approach , we first recall that ishii and lions introduced in @xcite a simple method to prove @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) regularity of viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear , possibly degenerate , elliptic partial differential equations , which has the double advantage of providing _ explicit @xmath9 estimates _ combined with a _ light localization procedure_.    this simple method , closely related to classical viscosity solutions theory , was recently explored by the first , second and fourth authors in @xcite for _ second order , fully nonlinear elliptic partial integro - differential equations _ , dealing with a large class of integro - differential operators , whose singular measures depend on @xmath11 .",
    "they prove that the solution is @xmath12-hlder continuous for any @xmath13 , where @xmath14 characterizes the singularity of the measure associated with the integral operator .",
    "however , in the case @xmath15 the respective ad - literam estimates do not yield lipschitz regularity .    in order to treat a large class of nonlinear equations",
    ", the authors of @xcite assume the nonlinearity satisfies a suitable ellipticity growth assumption .",
    "roughly speaking , this assumption gives a suitable meaning to a generalized ellipticity of the equation in the sense that at each point of the domain , the ellipticity comes either from the second order term ( the equation is strictly elliptic in the classical fully nonlinear sense ) , or from the nonlocal term ( the equation is strictly elliptic in a nonlocal nonlinear sense ) .",
    "in a recent study of the strong maximum principle for integro - differential equation @xcite , the third author introduced another type of _ mixed ellipticity _ : at each point , the nonlinearity may be _ degenerate in the second - order term , and in the nonlocal term _ , but _ the combination of the local and the nonlocal diffusions renders the nonlinearity uniformly elliptic_. equation  ( [ simpl - mide ] ) is the typical example of such _",
    "mixed integro - differential equations _ since the diffusion term gives the ellipticity in certain directions , whereas it is given by the nonlocal term in the complementary directions . for this type of nondegenerate equations ,",
    "the assumptions in @xcite are not satisfied .      using ishii - lions s viscosity method",

    "have been extended from elliptic partial differential equations to elliptic integro - differential equations . for results in the framework of green functions and classical solutions we send the reader to the up - to - date book of garroni and menaldi @xcite and the references therein .",
    "more recently there have been many papers dealing with @xmath9 estimates and regularity of solutions ( not necessarily in the viscosity setting ) for fully nonlinear integro - differential equations and the literature has been considerably enriched .",
    "it is not possible to give an exhaustive list of references but we next try to give the flavour of the known results .    in the framework of potential theory ( hence linear equations ) , bass and levin first",
    "establish harnack inequalities @xcite .",
    "then kassmann @xcite adapted the de giorgi theory to non - local operators . in the same spirit",
    ", silvestre gave in @xcite an analytical proof of hlder continuity for harmonic functions with respect to the integral operator .    in the setting of _ viscosity solutions",
    "_ , there are essentially two approaches for proving hlder or lipschitz regularity : either by the ishii - lions s method or by abp estimates and krylov - safonov and harnack type inequalities .",
    "these methods do not cover the same class of equations , they have different aims and each of them has its own advantages .",
    "the powerful harnack approach was first introduced by krylov and safonov @xcite for linear equations under non - divergence form and then adapted to fully non - linear elliptic equations by trudinger @xcite and caffarelli @xcite .",
    "this theory applies to _ uniformly elliptic , fully nonlinear equations _ , with _",
    "rough coefficients_. the existing theory for second order elliptic equations has been extended to integro - differential equations by caffarelli and silvestre in @xcite . both for local and non - local equations , this theory leads to further regularity such as @xmath65 .",
    "but as far as nonlocal equations are concerned , it requires in particular some integrability condition of the measure at infinity .    on the contrary ,",
    "direct viscosity methods apply under weaker ellipticity assumptions but require hlder continuous coefficients and do not seem to yield further regularity .",
    "finally these methods allow measures which are only bounded at infinity .    very recently , cardaliaguet and rainer showed hlder regularity of viscosity solutions for nonlocal hamilton jacobi equations with superquadratic gradient growth @xcite , using probablistic representation formulas .",
    "we would like to conclude this introduction by mentioning that this work was motivated by the study of long time behaviour of periodic viscosity solutions for integro - differential equations , that we are considering in a companion paper .",
    "we point out that long time behaviour comes to the resolution of the stationary ergodic problem , which is basically the cell problem in homogenization .",
    "the periodic homogenization for nonlinear integro - differential equations has been adressed by schwab in @xcite .",
    "however , it is restricted to a certain family of equations , due to a lack of fine abp estimate .",
    "recently , schwab and guillen provided @xcite and abp estimate that would help solve the homogenization for a wider class of nonlinearities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_lip_assumptions ]",
    "we give the appropriate definition of viscosity solution , make precise the ellipticity growth conditions to be satisfied by the nonlinearities and list the assumptions on the nonlocal terms . section ",
