    "ngc6334 is a giant molecular cloud located at a distance of 1.7kpc @xcite in the southern galactic plane . lying along a gas filament of 11pc in length ,",
    "ngc6334 exhibits several luminous sites of massive star formation  as seen in the far - infrared ( @xcite , five sources denoted using roman numerals i to v ) and radio continuum ( @xcite , six sources denoted with letters from a to f ) with source i dominating the millimetre to the far infrared @xcite . in close proximity to ngc6334i , about two arcminutes to the north",
    ", another bright source is found in the millimetre- and submillimetre continuum , denoted ngc6334i(n ) @xcite . while this source is believed to be a comparably young object  as concluded from the lack of hii regions and mid - ir emission ",
    "there is compelling evidence however , that star formation is going on there ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is this twin core system , ngc6334i and i(n ) , that offers the rare opportunity to study the evolution of high mass stars from the same parental cloud and in a relatively small spatial region .",
    "single dish molecular line observations show both cores to be chemically rich @xcite with source i being comparable in line density to prototypical hot cores such as orion - kl and sgrb2(n ) @xcite .",
    "high spatial resolution observations towards both cores have been conducted : atca investigations of nh@xmath1 emission up to the ( 6,6 ) inversion transition reveals the presence of warm gas in both cores @xcite and sma continuum observations at 1.3 mm @xcite resolve each core into a sample of sub - cores of several tens of solar masses each , four for source i and seven for i(n ) , demonstrating the formation of star clusters .",
    "several line mapping studies using standard molecular tracers were carried out in the past to obtain information about the large scale spatial distribution of molecular gas @xcite additionally leading to the detection of several molecular outflows associated with both cores @xcite .    in the present investigation",
    "we have used the mopra telescope for spectral line mapping of a 5@xmath05  region around ngc6334i and i(n ) throughout the entire 3 mm range .",
    "observations were carried out in 2006 on june 25th , using the 22 m mopra telescope near coonabarabran , new south wales , australia .",
    "we used the recently commissioned 3 mm mmic receiver in combination with the new mopra spectrometer , mops , in broadband mode resulting in an instantaneous bandwidth of 8ghz split over four overlapping ifs of 2.2ghz each . at the time of the observations mops provided 1024 channels per if , giving a total of 8192 channels .",
    "the spectral resolution of the observations was 2mhz corresponding to a velocity resolution of about 6kms@xmath6 per channel . for ngc6334",
    ", this velocity resolution is about the same , or slightly larger than expected line widths , which means while we do not expect to spectrally resolve many lines , we will not suffer a significant loss in signal due to spectral smearing .",
    "thus , this work will necessarily concentrate on morphologies and integrated intensities of emission , rather than any analysis of kinematic structure .",
    "the pointing centre for the maps was chosen to be ra(j2000 ) = 17 20 54.24 , dec(j2000 ) = -35 46 11.5 , which is approximately half way between ngc6334i and i(n ) .",
    "we used the on - the - fly mapping routine to map an area of 5@xmath05  around this position . due to incomplete sampling of the edges of the map ,",
    "a slightly smaller area is considered in this work .",
    "a scanning rate of 3.5 arcsecs@xmath6 was used .",
    "data were averaged every 2 seconds which gives an optimum data collection rate with minimal smearing of the output .",
    "a spacing of 10 arcseconds was used between each scanning row . assuming a beam of between 33 and 36 , depending on the frequency @xcite , this observing mode resulted in a fully sampled map .",
    "a single map was obtained in about 90 minutes , including about 15% of this time for t@xmath7 calibration , reference observations and pointing on a nearby sio maser ( ah sco ) .",
    "poor weather ( clouds ) affected some of the data , which usually appears as faint horizontal stripes in the data ( see the following sections for details ) .",
    "figure [ spectra ] shows spectra at i and i(n ) across the 3 mm band .",
    "each spectrum was made by integrating the emission over a box approximately equal to the size of the beam .",
    "the spectrum for ngc6334i was centred on the methanol maser site that overlaps with the uc hii region ( 17 20 53.35 , -35 47 1.6 ) and the spectrum for ngc6334i(n ) was centred on the methanol maser site ( 17 20 54.58 -35 45 8.6 ) . across the band ,",
    "we detect a total of 52 transitions from 19 species .",
    "details of each detection are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "for each of these transitions , we provide a map of the emission , shown in figure [ images ] .",
    "figure [ continuum ] shows dust continuum emission in the region taken using scuba on the jcmt ( gran sandell , _ private communication _ ) .",
    "these images were taken on june 26th and july 1st , 1998 , with measured half - power beam widths of @xmath8 at 850@xmath9 m and @xmath10 at 450@xmath9 m . in this figure ,",
    "the plus symbols represent the positions of methanol maser emission @xcite . in the north , the methanol maser site marks the position of ngc6334i(n ) . in the south ,",
    "two maser sites are seen , spaced about @xmath11 apart .",
    "coincident with one of these maser sites , and marked by the diamond is the uc hii region ngc6334i .",
    "the other , nearby maser site marks the position of a hot core ( eg .",
    "the circle marks the position , and approximate extent of the hii region ngc6334e .",
    "strong sources of submm continuum emission appear associated with both ngc6334i and ngc6334i(n ) . at the position of ngc6334i , the dust continuum appears to peak at the uc hii region position , rather than the hot core located to the north - west .",
    "the continuum emission also appears to be essentially unresolved here .",
    "higher resolution observations by @xcite show the continuum emission does fragment into multiple sources .",
    "the continuum emission associated with ngc6334i appears to be extended over almost an arcminute , corresponding to a projected length of nearly 0.5pc .",
    "the continuum emission also appears to peak about @xmath12 to the south - east of the maser site associated with ngc6334i(n ) .",
    "the greyscale continuum images also show the low level dust emission , which exhibits a prominent filamentary structure running from the south - western corner to the centre - top of the field of view . other , weaker filamentary structures appear as a bridge between ngc6334i and i(n ) , as well as possibly connecting ngc6334i and ngc6334e , although very little continuum emission is coincident with the hii region ngc6334e .",
    "the very weak filamentary structure appears to extend from ngc6334i(n ) to the north - eastern corner of the field of view . finally , there is some emission seen directly to the north of ngc6334i(n ) , which may be an extension of the filament seen to bridge the gap between ngc6334i and i(n ) .                         [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the upper - left image shows the c@xmath13o/@xmath14co line ratio map .",
    "the greatest ratio is found surrounding ngc6334i(n ) .",
    "a high ratio between these two lines means that the @xmath14co line is optically thick .",
    "we also see a secondary peak in the ratio to the south  west of ngc6334e , which is close to the peak @xmath14co peak integrated intensity ( shown in contours ) . at this position ,",
    "it is likely that there is a high column density of gas . at ngc6334i",
    ", the line ratio is relatively low .",
    "the @xmath14co gas is likely optically thick here since it is one of the centres of high column density gas in many other lines .",
    "the relatively low ratio , compared to that found in ngc6334i(n ) indicates that the @xmath14co emission is likely to be optically thick along most lines of sight cvered in these observations .",
    "the upper - right image shows the hnco / c@xmath13o line ratio map . as mentioned in  [ comp ] , hnco tends to be destroyed in pdrs .",
    "thus , the line ratio map broadley shows two regions in the map : a region to the east of ngc6334i(n ) which shows a high ratio ( ie . not a pdr ) and a region including ngc6334i and e , which appears to be a good candidate pdr , although low signal in hnco limits our interpretation beyond a narrow strip joining ngc6334i and e.    the lower - left image shows the ch@xmath1cn / n@xmath2h@xmath3 line ratio map . as mentioned in  [ morph ] , the ch@xmath1cn emission is strongly confined to the centres of active star formation : ngc6334i and i(n ) , whereas n@xmath2h@xmath3 tends to trace ubiquitous and quiescent gas .",
    "the line ratio map clearly shows low line ratio towards ngc6334i , in contrast to a high ratio seen at ngc6334i(n ) .",
    "this demonstrates that i(n ) is a more quiescent region , presumably with star formation at a younger stage .",
    "the lower - right image shows the @xmath15cs / n@xmath2h@xmath3 line ratio map . here , we see the highest line ratio at the position of the hii  region ngc6334e .",
    "this is probably the result of n@xmath2h@xmath3 being destroyed by the hii  region .",
    "we have mapped a @xmath16 region , encompassing the high mass star formation sites ngc6334i and i(n ) .",
    "we have covered most of the 3 mm spectral window with these observations , using the mopra radiotelescope .",
    "our observations do not have sufficient spectral resolution to resolve spectral lines , but we compare morphologies of the various lines detected .",
    "we detect emission from 19 different moleules , ions and radicals , including multiple transitions of the same species and transitions from various isotopologues to yield a total of 52 spectral line detections .",
    "we find that ch@xmath1cn most closely follows the sites of active star formation , although these sites feature prominently most other observed species .",
    "in contrast , emission from both cn and c@xmath2h appear to be widespread and are good tracers of gas that is not associated with active star formation . n@xmath2h@xmath3 and hc@xmath1n",
    "morphologies closely resemble that of dust continuum emission , indicating that these two species are good tracers of column density , associated with both star forming sites and quiescent gas .",
    "interpretation of the emission from common species and their isotopologues ( ie .",
    "co , hco@xmath3 , hcn and hnc ) are difficult to interpret , which is likely due to some transitions being optically thick .",
    "all co isotopologues show a peak of emission about 45  to the south - west of the hii  region ngc6334e .",
    "however , this peak is not prominent in any other tracer , including dust continuum emission .",
    "we are currently unable to provide an explanation for this .",
    "ch@xmath1oh emission is seen in many transitions , including known class i and ii masers . due to the low spatial resolution of these observations",
    ", we can not conclude that we have detected any new masers amongst these new transitions .",
    "thermal ch@xmath1oh transitions show a marked difference in their ocurrence : transitions with upper level kinetic temperatures above 100k are found to be stronger towards ngc6334i and transitions with upper level kinetic temperatures below 22k are found to be stronger towards ngc6334i(n ) .",
    "this supports the interpretation that ngc6334i is a more evolved site for star formation than i(n ) .",
    "the authors would like to thank gran sandell for providing the scuba continuum images shown in figure [ continuum ] .",
    "the mopra telescope is part of the australia telescope and is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
    "the university of new south wales mopra spectrometer digital filter bank used for the observations with the mopra telescope was provided with support from the australian research council , together with the university of new south wales , university of sydney , monash university and the csiro .",
