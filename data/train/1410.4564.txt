    "it was once thought that we understood how globular clusters ( gcs ) formed in the early universe , but recent discoveries of their multiple populations ( mps ) have unraveled our long - held view of gcs as `` simple stellar populations '' formed in a single burst .",
    "it now appears that virtually _ all _ of them host multiple stellar generations , with secondary populations characterized by puzzling chemical compositions . after almost a decade since the first breakthrough ( bedin et al.2004 )",
    ", our current understanding can be summarized as follows :    * ubiquity .",
    "almost all gcs that have been adequately studied are composed of distinct stellar populations ( piotto et al .",
    "2012 ) , from two in number up to six or more ( @xmath0 cen , bellini et al .",
    "even clusters not yet sufficiently probed photometrically exhibit the telling na - o anti - correlation in the spectra of their giant stars ( carretta et al .",
    "an exception is rup106 .",
    "villanova et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have analyzed spectra of nine rgb stars , and concluded that this gc hosts a single stellar population .",
    "in addition , walker et al .  ( 2011 ) claimed that ic4499 does not show evidence of multiple populations . in both cases ,",
    "higher precision stellar photometry is needed for a definitive conclusion on the nature of the stellar populations in these two gcs . * enrichment .",
    "while the first - generation ( 1 g ) stars have a composition that can be ascribed to the proto - galactic interstellar matter out of which they formed , the second - generation ( 2 g ) stars can be depleted in c and o , enhanced in n and na ( e.g. , carretta et al .",
    "2009 , marino et al .",
    "2008 , 2011a 2011b , 2012 2014 ) , and enhanced in he ( milone et al .  2012a , 2012b , 2014a ) . in some cases",
    "the he enhancement can be quite strong , close to y=0.40 ( e.g. , dantona and caloi 2004 , norris 2004 , piotto et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 , king et al .",
    "2012 , bellini et al .",
    "2013a ) , while in others it is still measurable but small ( e.g. , @xmath10.01 as in the cases of ngc 6397 , milone et al .",
    "2012b , and ngc 288 , piotto et al .  2013 ) .",
    "this chemical pattern indicates that the material out of which gcs formed was exposed to proton - capture processes at high temperatures and must have come from relatively massive 1 g stars . with a few notable exceptions , i.e. , omega centauri ( norris & da costa 1995 ) , m22 ( marino et al .  2009 , 2011c ) , m54 ( carretta et al .  2010 ) , ngc 1851 ( yong and grundahl 2008 ) , m2 ( yong et al .  2014 ) , ngc5824 ( da costa et al .",
    "2014 ) , and terzan 5 ( ferraro et al .",
    "2009a ) , 2 g stars have the same abundances of iron and other heavy - elements as the 1 g stars , indicating that their material was somehow not tainted by 1 g supernova products .",
    "even in the case of clusters exhibiting multiple iron abundances , the differences are relatively small , indicating that only a tiny fraction of the supernova products from 1 g were incorporated in 2 g stars ( renzini 2013 ) .",
    "it is not clear at present whether the clusters with iron abundance variations are part of a different class of gcs .",
    "because of the large number of gcs sampled , go-13297 will surely help to address this idea . * variety .",
    "thus far , we have found no two clusters that manifest the mp phenomenon in the same way .",
    "the relative proportion of 1 g to 2 g stars differs enormously from one gc to another , and in several cases the 2 g stars outnumber 1 g stars and are more centrally concentrated ( as in @xmath0 centauri , bellini et al .",
    "2010 , and 47 tuc , milone et al .",
    "2012a , see also lardo et al .  2011 , but based on lower quality sdss data . ) , becoming quite dominant at the very center . in other cases ,",
    "large differences are also seen in the degree of he enhancement and in p - capture elements .",
    "* discreteness .",
    "one crucial property of multiple populations is that in a large number of gcs the populations can be separated into quite distinct sequences within each cmd and/or in appropriate two - color plots , as opposed to a continuous spread , observational results that any formation scenario must be able to account for .",
    "different progenitors of the 2 g have been proposed .",
    "intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb - m ) stars ( dantona et al .",
    "2002 ) , fast - rotating massive stars ( frms ) ( decressin et al .  2007 ) , or interacting massive binary stars ( de mink et al .",
    "2009 , vanbeveren et al .",
    "2012 ) may eject materials with composition similar to that of 2 g stars , i.e. , somewhat helium enriched and exposed to proton capture reactions at high temperatures , but with sizable differences from one case to another .",
    "+ the agb - m and the frms models are those for which all the different aspects of the study of multiple populations have been more extensively investigated . although these models are based on different sources of processed gas , in both models the amount of gas available for 2 g formation is only a small fraction of the initial 1 g . this has the important implication that both these models require the 1 g star cluster to be initially more massive than it is now ( see e.g. decressin et al .  2007 ,",
    "renzini 2008 , 2013 , dercole et al.2008 , ventura et al .",
    "2014 for estimates of the possible initial 1 g cluster masses ) , and must have undergone a significant loss of 1 g stars ( see , e.g. , dercole et al .",
    "2008 , decressin et al .",
    "2010 ) leading to the large fraction of 2 g stars currently observed in many gcs ( renzini 2008 ) .",
    "this large loss of 1 g stars also implies that gcs must have significantly contributed to the formation of the galactic halo ( see e.g. vesperini et al .",
    "2010 , schaerer & charbonnel 2011 ) .",
    "another requirement shared by these models is that , not only ejected material from the 1 g stars is necessary .",
    "it may have been somehow diluted with gas with the same composition as the 1 g in order to reproduce the na - o anticorrelation ( as advocated by decressin et al.2007 , dercole et al .",
    "2008 , 2011 ) , though the modalities of such dilution remain obscure .",
    "the origin of this pristine gas is still a matter of investigation and debate .",
    "curiously , recent surveys of young ( 10 myr - 1 gyr ) extragalactic massive clusters ( bastian et al.2013a ) do not show any evidence of presence of gas and/or ongoing star formation , though the facts are not quite clear on this ( vink et al.2009 ) .",
    "recently bastian et al .  (",
    "2013b ) , following an earlier suggestion by dantona et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , proposed a model which would not require a larger 1 g cluster mass and is based on the accretion of enriched material released from interacting massive binaries and rapidly rotating stars onto their circumstellar disks , and ultimately onto the young pre - main sequence stars .",
    "this model requires some very ad hoc assumptions ( see cassisi & salaris 2014 , salaris & cassisi 2014 , dantona et al .",
    "2014 ) both regarding the lifetimes of the pre - main sequence accretion disk and regarding the he content of the accreting material .",
    "most importantly , the accretion scenario has serious difficulties to account for the discreteness of the sequences we observe in the cmds .    in summary ,",
    "the series of events that led from massive gas clouds in the early universe to the gcs we see today remains an intriguing puzzle . clearly , gc formation was a far more complex process than ever imagined before .",
    "clues and insight needed to solve this puzzle can come only from homogeneous mapping of a large sample of gcs with appropriate multi - band photometry .",
    "a photometric survey can map a large sample of stars , at all evolutionary phases .",
    "such a survey will enable us to identify 2 g stars even in the cases where they represent a minor fraction of the entire cluster population .",
    "multi - band photometry allows us to infer chemical properties of stars in a complementary way to spectroscopy ( milone et al .",
    "2012a ) , and to do this for a large sample of gcs .",
    "this is the subject of the go-13297 hst large treasury project ( pi g.  piotto ) approved for cycle 21 .",
    "this paper will describe in detail the project , the selected sample of clusters ( see table 1 ) , the observational strategy , the data - reduction strategy , and the intended use of the data by the team .",
    "we will also present preliminary results from the data acquired thus far .",
    "previous studies , based on spectroscopy and ground - based photometry have shown that stremgren and ultraviolet photometry does a good job in separating multiple populations along the rgb on nearbly gcs ( e.g. yong et al.2008 ; marino et al.2008 ) .",
    "our wfc3/uvis observations in cycles 1820 have opened a spectacular new window by showing that uv / optical colors separate the various sub - populations much better than the traditional optical colors alone ( bellini et al.2010 , 2013a , milone et al .",
    "2010 , 2012a , 2012b , piotto et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 ) and do so across the _ entire _ color - magnitude diagram , from the main sequence ( ms ) all the way to the horizontal branch ( hb ) .",
    "figure  [ magicuvf ] shows the power of the uv photometry for the case of ngc 6752 .",
    "it reproduces the simulated spectra of rgba ( n - poor , he - poor red line , first stellar generation ) and rgbc ( n - rich , he - rich blue line , third stellar generation ) of ngc  6752 ( milone et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the reason why f275w , f336w , and f438w work so well is quite simple .",
    "milone et al .",
    "( 2012a ) emphasized that the f275w passband includes an oh molecular band , f336w an nh band , and f438w ( or f435w for acs ) cn and ch bands , as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "this property of the hst filter system is at the basis of the project we are presenting in this paper .",
    "the 1 g stars , which are oxygen- and carbon - rich and nitrogen - poor , are relatively faint in f275w and f438w , but bright in f336w .",
    "conversely , 2 g stars , whose material has been cno - cycle processed , are oxygen- and carbon - poor but nitrogen - rich . as a consequence , they are relatively bright in f275w and f438w but faint in f336w .",
    "therefore , 1 g stars are bluer than 2 g stars in one color ( f336w @xmath2 f438w ) , but redder in another ( f275w @xmath2 f336w ) , and this _ inversion _ is seen in fig .  [ magicuvf ] milone et al .",
    "( 2013 ) defined a pseudo - color @xmath3 = ( @xmath4)@xmath2(@xmath5 ) , which maximizes the virtue of both f336w @xmath2 f438w and f275w @xmath2 f336w , and has proven to be quite efficient in separation of multiple sequences .",
    "figure  [ n6352 ] shows an example of the application of go-13297 data to ngc 6352 . left panels show the power of the pseudo - color @xmath3 in separating the two mss .",
    "the middle panels show that in the @xmath6 vs.  @xmath7 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , 1 g stars are redder than 2 g ones , but they become bluer in the @xmath6 vs. @xmath8 cmd ( right panels ) .",
    "thanks to f275w , f336w , and f438w data , the two stellar generations are clearly distinguished and are seen to wind , in a distinct but intertwined fashion , from the ms through the subgiant branch ( sgb ) and red - giant branch ( rgb ) , to the hb .",
    "the uv passbands are thus able to probe the cno content of the cluster stars .",
    "note that the nuclear processes that produce the light - element ( anti-)correlations ( e.g. the na - o or the mg - al anticorrelations ) also produce helium , and measuring the he enhancement of each sub - population is particularly important to help pinpoint what kind of stars may have produced the 2 g material .",
    "the photometric impact of he is mainly on the optical bands ( through the stellar temperature ) .",
    "after population - tagging stars according to their uv colors , we can make fine distinctions ( @xmath10.01 mag in color ) in the ms ridge lines of the generations in the optical bands , and thus infer variations of only a few per cent in he ( milone et al .",
    "2010 , 2012ab ) . in summary ,",
    "the combination of uv and optical colors allows us to estimate the content of c , n , o , and he , even for stars that are far too faint to pursue with spectroscopy .",
    "( see milone et al .",
    "2012ab , 2013 for applications of the method . )",
    "the combination of uv / blue filters that we have selected for go-13297 is also ideally suited for studies of hb stars , blue stragglers stars ( bsss ) , and compact binaries . for hot hb stars ,",
    "optical colors quickly become degenerate , but uv colors are able to follow the entire hb extension .",
    "this is particularly interesting for those gcs ( even some metal - rich ones , rich et al .",
    "1997 , busso et al .  2007 ,",
    "bellini et al .",
    "2013a ) that have very extended hbs and often exhibit the most complex mps .",
    "enhanced helium also distorts the hb morphology :  when @xmath9 is increased from 0.23 to 0.38 the blue hb becomes 1 mag brighter in f275w , while the ehb becomes 0.5 mag fainter .",
    "thus the uv band is crucial for determining the physical parameters of hb stars ( including @xmath10 ) and their helium content ( rood & crocker 1989 , dantona and caloi 2008 ) .",
    "bsss , compact binaries , and high - energy sources are also best studied with filters of shorter wavelength .",
    "detailed studies , made possible largely by _ hst _ , have revealed remarkable variety and complexity . as mentioned above , among the dozen or so gcs in which multiple photometric sequences have been resolved thus far , the fraction of 2 g stars ranges from a few per cent to well over 50% .",
    "each gc has its own individuality , thus pointing to a great deal of variance in the formation process itself . yet",
    "the sheer range of variance remains to be established , and can not be properly mapped without the widest possible survey of galactic gcs .",
    "furthermore , since spectroscopy has shown that nearly all gcs host mps , it is all the more appropriate to move from studying a few `` odd ducks '' to a systematic survey of the whole flock .",
    "the largest homogeneous set of _ hst _ data on gcs until now is the acs treasury database of f606w and f814w images for 65 gcs ( go-10775 , pi sarajedini , anderson et al .",
    "2008 ) ; however , its optical - wavelength baseline offers sub - optimal leverage for mp studies . the new go-13297 data set represents what is needed :  to augment the existing database with uv and blue observations through the `` magic trio '' of wfc3/uvis filters , f275w , f336w , and f438w , whose power in population separation we have just illustrated .",
    "our photometry will characterize the populations in each cluster :  how many stellar generations are present , and in what relative proportions  even for small minority populations that might easily escape spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the uv / blue wfc3/uvis photometry , combined with visible photometry from the acs gc treasury , will also enable a systematic survey and detailed intercomparisons of the populations of ehb stars , bsss , and compact binaries in a large sample of galactic gcs , as outlined in section  [ legacy ] .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show that multiple populations of many clusters can be readily disentangled by means of a two - color diagram made from f275w , f336w , and f438w . in order to effect a clean separation of the populations with the cmds and the pseudo - color diagrams ,",
    "our observational goal was a color precision of about 0.02 magnitude or better , which implies a @xmath11 of 50 or better in f275w ( the most photon - starved filter ) .",
    "we did not try to follow the multiple sequences all the way down the main sequence for every cluster  that would have been prohibitively expensive orbit - wise .",
    "rather , our goal was simply to maintain this precision in f275w to just below the turn - off .",
    "that will naturally give us a population separation for the evolved populations as well .",
    "given that we need a minimum of 4 exposures in each band to make a robust catalog , two orbits represent the minimum set of observations for each cluster .",
    "fifteen clusters are observed with that allocation ( see table  1 for a detailed description of the observing time allocated for each cluster and for the different filters ) .",
    "four clusters need 3 orbits each , eight clusters need 4 orbits , three need 5 orbits , and two clusters need 6 orbits each .",
    "( one of the 6-orbit clusters is ngc 6715 [ m54 ] , which is too far away to get 0.02-magnitude precision below the turnoff in f275w .",
    "but it is likely to have a larger ms spread , and therefore not need a @xmath11 as high as 50 .",
    "furthermore , understanding its upper sequences with a mp - sensitive filter system will be important . )",
    "the remaining 14 clusters are so far away or too reddened that we can not hope to resolve ms splits with f275w ; for these clusters we allot two orbits , which are adequate for the sgb , rgb , and hb populations .",
    "we observe each gc in two visits , with orientations separated by roughly 90 degrees , to allow a direct validation of the charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) corrections ( see below ) . for most gcs , we take two exposures per filter per visit .",
    "these exposures are dithered to cover the gap , so that most stars will be found in four exposures in each band , thus allowing a robust empirical estimate of the photometric errors .    in summary",
    "( see table  1 ) , the go-13297 gc sample includes 47 gcs and a very old ( @xmath12 gyr , king et al .",
    "2005 ) , open cluster , ngc 6791 , which has been included in the sample because of its many peculiarities ( bedin et al .",
    "2008 , geisler et al .",
    "the program has been allocated 131 orbits .",
    "originally , the program also included ngc 4147 .",
    "unfortunately , the cluster could not be scheduled ( for guiding star problems ) and has been substituted with m4 . before go-13297",
    "we had a pilot project , go-12605 ( pi piotto , 22 orbits ) , where we began our collection of wfc3/uvis f275w , f336w , and f438w images for seven gcs ( m3 , m13 , m15 , m80 , ngc 288 , ngc 362 , and ngc 2808 ) , extending previous f606w and f814w data from go-10775 . in an even earlier project , go-12311 ( pi piotto , 17 orbits ) ,",
    "we had collected wfc3/uvis f275w images in the go-10775 fields of five more clusters ( 47tuc , m4 , m22 , ngc 1851 , and ngc 6752 ) .",
    "the go-12311 data set is now complemented by f336w and f438w wfc3/uvis images for ngc 1851 , m4 , and m22 .",
    "some of the gcs from the previous go-10775 treasury program were not included in the go-13297 target list either because they are too poorly populated for a meaningful search for multiple sequences , or because they are highly reddened or extremely distant , which would have made them impossible to observe in the uv in a reasonable number of orbits . in summary ,",
    "completion of the go-13297 program gives us , across all programs , 57 gcs with a homogeneous set of images in the five photometric bands f275w , f336w , f438w , f606w , and f814w .",
    "table 1 lists these 57 clusters and summarizes their wfc3/uvis and parallel acs images .",
    "the final five columns in the table give the galactic @xmath13 coordinates , the reddening , and the distance modulus ( from the harris 1996 catalog , 2010 edition ) .",
    "gcs observed within go-12311 are marked by an asterisk ; gcs from go-12605 by two asterisks .",
    "figure [ gcdist ] shows the distribution of the clusters in the galactic @xmath14 and @xmath15 planes .",
    "wfc3/uvis has been on board _ hst _ for only a few years , yet cte losses have become a concern for it much more quickly than they were for acs .",
    "the uvis team has traced this to the fact that cte losses are particularly bad when the background is low ( see mackenty & smith 2012 ) . in order to minimize cte losses , we determined the anticipated background for each exposure and supplemented it with postflash to ensure a minimum of 12 e@xmath16 .",
    "in addition , to the extent possible , we observed each cluster at two different orientations 90 degrees apart so that any remaining cte issues can be dealt with properly .",
    "we will postflash our images to ensure a background of a least 12 e@xmath16 .",
    "the main focus of our program is uv imaging of the central field of each cluster , and our observing strategy was optimized for that field .",
    "even so , we could still afford to take @xmath14 medium - length exposures of a parallel field with acs ( more for the clusters with more than two orbits ) .",
    "our general strategy has been to take one orbit at one orientation and another at a different orientation .",
    "this resulted in placing the acs / wfc camera on two different fields 6  from the cluster center . for large he differences among the different populations",
    ", even these few parallel observations will allow us to detect split mss , as was successfully done in the case of ngc 2808 ( piotto et al .",
    "the mapping of the outskirts of the clusters , albeit at lower photometric accuracy , adds a large baseline to the spatial aspects of our mp study , and will allow us to measure the 1g/2 g radial gradient .",
    "the relative concentration of the 2 g stars provides critical information about the formation process ( see bellini et al .",
    "2009 and dercole et al .  2008 ) .",
    "when possible , we have chosen an orientation that allows the parallel fields to overlap previous observations , so that we can also measure proper motions for the outer field . at a minimum",
    ", we can use the wfpc2 parallels taken during the go-10755 program , but many clusters have even better archival data .",
    "note that the overlaps with previosly collected go-10775 images provide us with a @xmath17-year temporal baseline for relative proper - motion measurement .",
    "the outer - field observations should be deep enough to allow us also to measure absolute proper motions for the clusters , relative to background galaxies .",
    "the ultimate goal of this program is to provide comprehensive catalogs to the community in order to enable the many studies that this 57-cluster data set makes possible",
    ". it will not be possible to produce the best possible catalogs immediately .",
    "once we have the entire data set in hand , we will be able to do an exquisite characterization of the psfs and distortion solutions for each filter , as well as empirical corrections for any remaining cte issues .",
    "therefore the final catalogs will not be available until about a year after the last data are taken .",
    "there are , however , many studies that will not require a definitive catalog , and we are making preliminary products available to the community as soon as possible .",
    "in addition , team members will be performing special processing on individual clusters to produce early science results .",
    "we describe in the following subsections the three different reductions we envision for this project : the early - release preliminary reduction , the specialized reductions for early science , and the final comprehensive reduction .",
    "we have created a web page ( http://groups.dfa.unipd.it/espg/treasury.html ) where interested persons can follow the progress of the project and retrieve the released photometric and astrometric data .",
    "a mirror site will also be available in the mast archive , at stsci .",
    "much of the progress in understanding the mp phenomenon will be possible only by combining photometric observations of larger numbers of stars with targeted spectroscopic studies of individual stars . in an effort to allow spectroscopists to identify stars and plan their runs as soon as possible",
    ", we will provide an early reduction of the data shortly after the publication of this paper .",
    "we will update the archive as more data come in .",
    "the preliminary reduction will focus on measuring the stars in the simplest way possible and collating them with the existing go-10775 catalogs in f606w and f814w . to this end , we run on each exposure a version of img2xym_wfc3uv ( similar to the one - pass star finding and measuring for acs described in acs / isr-2006 - 01 by anderson & king , but adapted to the wfc3/uvis detector ) .",
    "this is a one - pass finding routine that goes through the image pixel by pixel , identifying as a potential star any pixel that has more than 100 counts within its inner 3x3 pixels and has no brighter pixels within a radius of 4 pixels . on each identified source",
    "we then use an empirical library psf to perform psf - based 5@xmath175-pixel aperture photometry and determine an accurate position .",
    "it then uses the wcs information to transform the measured positions into the go-10775 catalog frame and matches up each star list to the stars in the catalog .",
    "once this has been done for all the available exposures , we collate the observations of each star in each filter and produce a catalog that has the following elements : first , we provide a 2013 - 2014 position that can be compared against the 2006 position from go-10775 .",
    "since we have not optimized the psfs and astrometric transformations , this position has only 0.1-pixel precision , but that should be sufficient for cluster - field separation .",
    "we next provide the f275w , f336w , and f438w photometry for all the stars in the go-10775 catalog that could be found by our one - pass routine .",
    "we provide the vega - mag - calibrated average magnitude , the rms deviation of the individual observations about this average , and the number of images that contributed to the average .",
    "finally , we also produce stacked images in each of the three new bands , in the frame of the original f606w products .",
    "the early - release catalog described above has been constructed with a library psf and a one - pass finding approach that treats each star as if it is isolated .",
    "the final reduction will improve on several of these limitations , but since it will be more than a year before the final reductions are available , in the meantime several members of the team have been running supplemental reductions in order to start the detailed scientific analysis of several clusters .",
    "these reductions will be described in more detail in the individual papers ( for example , see milone et al .  for m2 ,",
    "submitted to apj ) , but many of them will make use of photometry software ( such as that described in bellini et al .",
    "2010 ) that allows for the fact that the psfs in individual exposures often differ slightly from the library psf .",
    "the specialized reductions will also include differential - reddening corrections .",
    "both of these improvements are necessary to enable the best possible sequence separation for study of the multiple populations .",
    "other early - science projects will focus on the internal proper motions .",
    "the one - size - fits - all preliminary products will not do the careful transformations and multi - epoch fitting that is necessary to measure accurate motions and their errors . for the clusters of particular interest",
    ", we will reduce all the available epochs and explore the internal motions in papers before the final catalogs are available .",
    "these data are available for specific projects under request to the first author of this paper , and will be stored on the dedicated web page at the department of physics and astronomy , of the university of padova ( http://groups.dfa.unipd.it/espg/treasury.html ) .",
    "the preliminary photometry coming from this process is at the base of the cmds we present in this paper .      the final reduction for this program will be possible",

    "differential reddening analysis and reddening maps . _ the interstellar medium exhibits complex structure , on scales ranging from a few astronomical units to several kiloparsecs ( e.g. , schlegel et al .",
    "we plan to determine for each cluster a high - resolution map ( typically around 10 square arcsec ) of differential reddening ( as in milone et al .  2012b , sect .  3 )",
    "correcting photometry for differential reddening is a crucial step for identifying multiple stellar populations in the cmd of any gc .",
    "_ uv photometric standards .",
    "_ to date there is no large space - based network of uv photometric standards .",
    "we propose to use hst uv archival material to improve the existing absolute photometric calibration of wfc3/uvis in f275w and f336w bands , and to build a network of photometric standards that will remain a fundamental reference for years to come .",
    "go-13297 gcs are rather evenly distributed in the sky and contains hundreds of bright and relatively isolated ( at least in uv images ) stars that can be used to calibrate other uv instruments , and the ground - based u - band observations .",
    "this is particularly valuable taking into account that after _ hst _",
    ", no other large space - based observatory with uv capability is expected to fly for at least 10 years .",
    "_ serendipity .",
    "_ we are certain that in addition to those mentioned above , this multi - band legacy database for galactic gcs will offer unlimited possibilities for serendipitous discoveries and an extremely wide variety of other scientific investigations , and will contribute to our understanding of the formation of our galaxy itself .",

    "<S> in this paper we describe a new uv - initiative _ hst _ project ( go-13297 ) that will complement the existing f606w and f814w database of the acs globular cluster ( gc ) treasury by imaging most of its clusters through uv / blue wfc3/uvis filters f275w , f336w and f438w . </S>",
    "<S> this `` magic trio '' of filters has shown an uncanny ability to disentangle and characterize multiple - population ( mp ) patterns in gcs in a way that is exquisitely sensitive to c , n , and o abundance variations . </S>",
    "<S> combination of these passbands with those in the optical also gives the best leverage for measuring helium enrichment . </S>",
    "<S> the dozen clusters that had previously been observed in these bands exhibit a bewildering variety of mp patterns , and the new survey will map the full variance of the phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> the ubiquity of multiple stellar generations in gcs has made the formation of these cornerstone objects more intriguing than ever ; gc formation and the origin of their mps have now become one and the same problem . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we will describe the data base and our data reduction strategy , as well as the uses we intend to make of the final photometry , astrometry , and proper motions . </S>",
    "<S> we will also present preliminary color - magnitude diagrams from the data so far collected . </S>",
    "<S> these diagrams also draw on data from go-12605 and go-12311 , which served as a pilot project for the present go-13297 .    </S>",
