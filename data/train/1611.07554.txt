    "the last few years have seen tremendous progress in modeling and analyzing heterogeneous catalysis using the first - principles kinetic monte carlo approach(1p - kmc)@xcite .",
    "the appealing features of the approach are an elementary reaction mechanism ( and corresponding rate constants ) , which has been derived from predictive quality electronic structure methods , and a subsequent solution of the resulting master equation by trajectory sampling .",
    "the last step thereby only introduces a numerical ( tunable ) error , in contrast to the prevalent phenomenological kinetics where the employed mean - field approximation might miss qualitative features@xcite . however , kinetic monte carlo has some significant drawbacks . besides the need to perform one reaction event after the other and the concomitant large computational costs , it is a huge effort to obtain parameter sensitivities , which are a measure for the rate - determining steps@xcite .",
    "the evaluation is generally costly because sensitivities are not straightforward expectation values such as coverages or rates .    during the last years",
    ", a number of approaches for sensitivity analysis of kmc models have been developed , mostly in the context of biological `` reaction '' networks and the chemical master equation ( in this context kmc is often termed stochastic simulation ) .",
    "these can be grouped into two sets of approaches : i ) targeting at a reduction of the noise in finite difference approximations@xcite , and ii ) targeting a direct estimation of sensitivities from the analysis of the simulated trajectories@xcite . albeit being improvements to the brute force numerical differentiation , both groups have their limitations .",
    "direct estimation approaches allow obtaining all sensitivities from the same set of trajectories , ( for ergodic stationary processes from a single trajectory ) . on the other hand",
    ", the variance of the corresponding estimators increases with increasing time horizon@xcite . especially for stiff problems , the later point is a major concern , as it severely affects the estimation of steady state sensitivities , and there are quite some efforts on sampling strategies for stationary sensitivities@xcite .",
    "this problem is not as severe for the finite difference based approaches .",
    "these , however , require additional simulations for every targeted sensitivity and generally a good guess for the difference parameter@xcite .    for lattice based models as they appear in heterogeneous catalysis ,",
    "the methodology for sensitivity analysis is not that mature and there is only a limited number of studies addressing these high - dimensional , usually very stiff problems@xcite .    in this study",
    ", we device a three - stage strategy for the estimation of stationary sensitivities , which is suitable for these problems .",
    "we illustrate this strategy on the model for the co oxidation on ruo@xmath1(110 ) by reuter@xcite , which is a popular fruit - fly test problem@xcite .",
    "we revisit the reaction conditions studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and can therefore concentrate on discussing the peculiarities of the sensitivity estimation .",
    "the basic idea of the approach is to first try to directly sample the sensitivities from a single trajectory and only to employ the coupled finite differences method@xcite for those sensitivities , for which the direct sampling estimator shows a too high variance . in practice ,",
    "directly sampling all sensitivities without prior knowledge might soon become unpractical .",
    "we therefore first estimate bounds for the sensitivities using the pathwise relative entropy method@xcite ( section [ sec : bounds ] ) .",
    "this also allows to extract an expansion parameter , which is needed for our direct sampling approach and represents the system s memory .",
    "so , we avoid its estimation in the direct sampling step and can significantly reduce the sampling effort there .",
    "our direct sampling approach is based on a series expansion of integrated linear response functions and presented in section [ sec : linearresponse ] .",
    "as it turns out , the derived estimator is very similar to that by chen and cao@xcite .",
    "however , our estimator is based on a very different reasoning and avoids the use of random time steps . in the end",
    ", these two steps allow to significantly reduce the number of required coupled finite differences ( cfd ) estimates as presented in section [ sec : coupledfinitedifferences ] .    with the addition of the direct sampling",
    ", our approach can be viewed as an extension of the approach put forward by arampatzis , katsoulakis , and pantazis in the context of the chemical master equation@xcite .",
    "we find this additional step to be beneficial , as for most of the considered reaction conditions no or just very few cfd estimates remained necessary .",
    "sensitivity analysis aims at identifying the most important input parameters for a computational model .",
    "that is , if we change an input parameter , how much does the model output change .",
    "this information can then be used to identify those parameters , which need to be determined more accurately in order to arrive at a more reliable model . or",
    ", we can employ it to find out , which aspects of the underlying physical system could be optimized in order to arrive at a better performance . in first order ,",
    "such sensitivity information is provided by partial derivatives of the model output with respect to the input parameter .    in microkinetic modelling of heterogenous catalysis ,",
    "the central model outputs are the ( stationary ) reaction rates of one or more target reactions .",
    "as the input parameters have an atomistic meaning , sensitivity analysis is a tool to determine which atomistic aspects of the catalyst control the macroscopic reactivity .    in this section ,",
    "we outline the background for performing sensitivity analysis for 1p - kmc models .",
    "we start with the markov jump process description of kinetics on lattices .",
    "we then introduce sensitivity analysis in this context . after introducing the kinetic monte carlo methodology as a numerical tool for simulating markov jump processes",
    ", we detail the our test problem , the co oxidation on ruo@xmath1(110 ) .      in chemical kinetics",
    "the rare event dynamics , typical for surface catalytic processes , is exploited by considering a time evolution that is coarse - grained to the discrete elementary processes of the reaction mechanism . in this description",
    "a state @xmath2 of the system corresponds to a meta - stable state or domain in the microscopic evolution .",
    "that is , the time which is spend between two transitions between these domains is large compared to the time spend for one transition .",
    "we can then safely assume that in the time between such rare events the system loses all memory of the past by thermal fluctuations and the sequence of states can then be regarded as a markov jump process .",
    "the probabilities @xmath3 of finding the system in state @xmath4 then obey a master equation@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the vector of the probabilities .",
    "the stochastic generator @xmath7 has the matrix elements @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the transition rate for the event @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "the ( negative ) diagonal element @xmath12 is called the accumulated rate ( for state @xmath4 ) , which is simply the rate for escaping the state @xmath4 . in the following , we consider processes , which relax to a single stationary distribution @xmath13 .",
    "further , we assume that the transition probability @xmath14 defines a discrete time markov chain , which also relaxes to a single stationary distribution .",
    "for these prerequisites , we can proof the convergence of the series expansion employed in sections [ sec : bounds ] and [ sec : linearresponse]@xcite .    in the context of catalysis",
    ", the state @xmath4 can be regarded as an integer vector , which carries the information , which species is adsorbed on which adsorption site at the surface .",
    "due to symmetries , like translational invariance , and the locality of processes , we can group the allowed events @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) into different subsets , each assigned to one elementary step ( or reaction ) .",
    "this decomposition can be made a partition of the set of all allowed events , i.e. every allowed event is in a single set @xmath17 . for convenience",
    ", we impose that all processes @xmath18 belonging to the same subset @xmath17 have the same value for their transition rate .",
    "thus for each reaction @xmath17 , we can define the partial transition matrix @xmath19 with the elements @xmath20 where @xmath21 will be called the rate constant ( rc ) of the reaction @xmath17 in the following . with @xmath19",
    "we can define the ( partial ) generator @xmath22 as @xmath23 summing over all ( partial ) generators , we arrive at the ( total ) generator @xmath7 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total number of reactions we have for our system . as for the total generator ,",
    "the absolutes of diagonal elements of the partial generator are the partial accumulated rate @xmath26 .",
    "the central objective of kinetics in heterogeneous catalysis are average , stationary reaction rates @xmath27 , also called turnover frequencies ( tof ) , if suitably normalized . in the case , that there are multiple elementary reactions contributing to the targeted overall reaction , @xmath27 is the superpositions of the corresponding reaction rates @xmath28 of the elementary reactions @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the stationary probability distribution and @xmath31 is a constant which depends only on the stoichiometry of the reaction network . for the below discussed co oxidation on ruo@xmath1(110 ) , there are four reactions which yield one co@xmath1 molecule per event . in this case , @xmath31 for the co oxidation rate is one for each of these four and zero for all other reactions .",
    "we require a unique stationary probability distribution @xmath13 and the reaction rate @xmath27 is therefore a function of the rate constants . as the rcs measure",
    "how fast the elementary reactions proceed , finding out how @xmath27 reacts on little changes in the rcs , can be used to identify the most important steps , i.e. those steps which need to be accelerated or slowed down to achieve a higher reaction rate . in chemical kinetics , a useful measure for such sensitivity analysis is@xcite @xmath32 i.e. the relative change of @xmath27 over the relative change of the corresponding rc , while all other rcs are kept constant .",
    "we will term this sensitivity index degree of rate sensitivity ( drs ) .",
    "the drs can be regarded as generalized reaction order , which becomes clear for the case that all drs do not change for a range of values for the rcs . in this range ,",
    "the reaction rate obeys the relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is independent of the rcs . for elementary steps involving gas phase species",
    "@xmath35 like adsorption or eley - rideal reactions , we expect rate expressions of the form @xmath36 with the partial pressure @xmath37 .",
    "we then arrive at a power law kinetics @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the set of elementary steps involving the gas phase species @xmath35 and @xmath40 is independent of the partial pressures . thus the drs connect macroscopic reaction orders with microscopic elementary steps and rate constants .",
    "usually , we employ the rate expressions @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath43 is the temperature and @xmath44 is the activation barrier for the reaction .",
    "using sensitivity analysis , we can find a clear connection between the elementary barriers and the macroscopic apparent activation barrier @xmath45 by@xcite @xmath46 for brevity , we have provided only the dominant contribution and neglected the ( typically weak ) temperature dependence of the pre - exponential factor .    to simplify the later discussion",
    ", we decompose the drs @xmath47 using the product rule . here",
    "@xmath48 , which is the relative contribution to the total rate of the reaction @xmath17 .",
    "as this is a stationary expectation , it is straightforward to obtain from sampling",
    ". therefore we will concentrate on the second term @xmath49 in the further discussion .",
    "intuitively , @xmath50 can be regarded as the average effect on the creation and annihilation of states @xmath4 , which allow for those reactions contributing to the overall reactivity . as @xmath50 originates from the @xmath21-dependence of the probability distribution , this can not be expressed as a stationary expectation , except for the case when the stationary distribution is known as a function of the rcs . for obtaining @xmath50",
    ", we can omit any explicit dependence of @xmath51 on variations of the rcs .",
    "the drs is strongly related to the campbell s degree of rate control ( drc)@xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes a pair of forward and backward reaction and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the corresponding rcs of the forward reaction and the equilibrium constant , respectively .",
    "the only difference between drc and drs is what is kept constant during differentiation , all other rcs ( drs ) or all other forward rcs and the equilibrium constants ( drc ) . in a previous publication",
    "we therefore termed both degree of rate control@xcite . to clarify the presentation ,",
    "we have introduced a new name for the less common sensitivity measure [ eq : drc ] . applying the chain rule , we arrive at a simple relation between drs @xmath56 and drc @xmath57@xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 identifies the forward reaction and @xmath60 the backward reaction . the drc @xmath57 is therefore easily obtained by adding the drss for the forward and the reverse reaction .    by construction ,",
    "the drc @xmath61 is zero for reactions which are in equilibrium . identifying rate - determining steps by large",
    "@xmath62 agrees then with chemical intuition , which would not assign the property rate - determining to steps which are in equilibrium .",
    "this thermodynamic consistency is absent in the definition [ eq : drc ] for the @xmath56 . on the other hand ,",
    "the drss @xmath56 provide the sensitivity to all input parameters and thereby also allow to judge on the impact of equilibrated reactions .",
    "further , there exists no equivalent to eqn .",
    "[ eq : generalizedreactionorder ] to [ eq : apparentactivation ] for the drc . for a more detailed discussion of the microscopic meaning and the relation between them",
    "we refer the reader to reference@xcite .    which of both measures is easier to interpret or provides a deeper insight , is primarily a matter of taste .",
    "most information can probably be extracted using both and , by equation [ eq : whyweshouldalwayscalculateourdrcs ] , there is no limiting factor preventing us from doing so .",
    "we will , however , concentrate on the drs for most of the manuscript for the mere reason of shorter equations and a more comprehensive and compact presentation of the theoretical background .",
    "we come back to the drc when we discuss our final results in terms surface coverage and barriers .      in most cases ,",
    "the master equation is too high - dimensional to be solved directly .",
    "instead , one will simulate the underlying markov process and obtain estimates of the targeted expectations by averaging over trajectories .",
    "for this and all our implementations we use the kmos code package@xcite , which we have developed during the last years for lattice based kinetic monte carlo .",
    "we employ the so - called variable - step size method@xcite , which can be described as follows    1 .",
    "initialize the state @xmath4 and the time @xmath63[kmc : step1 ] 2 .",

    "3 .   choose the event @xmath67 with the probability @xmath68 4 .",
    "set @xmath69 and go to [ kmc : step1 ] or stop if the termination criterion is reached .",
    "the method essentially simulates a classical discrete time markov chain with the transition probability matrix @xmath70 and simply adjusts the time steps between the jumps to arrive at a statistically proper continuous time markov jumps process .    focusing on stationary reaction rates ,",
    "we can obtain estimates most conveniently by time averaging .",
    "that is , we will approximate @xmath28 , after a sufficiently long relaxation , with @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the sequence of states generated by the kmc simulation and @xmath73 are the corresponding time steps with @xmath74 . for the second approximation",
    "we have pre - averaged the time steps , i.e. @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this is a common approximation@xcite to reduce the noise caused by the random time steps and the introduced bias vanishes for large enough @xmath77 .    in practice",
    ", we will employ a number independent sample trajectories to estimate an expectation @xmath78 and the standard deviation of our estimate @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath80 is number of samples and @xmath81 are time averages .",
    "we generate these samples by first simulating the one trajectory .",
    "we then perform a number of kmc steps for decorrelation and then use the last configuration as initial condition for the next trajectory .",
    "we repeat this until we have reached the total number @xmath80 of samples .      throughout this article",
    ", we consider the realistic first - principles kinetic monte carlo ( 1p - kmc ) model for the co oxidation on ruo@xmath1(110 ) by reuter@xcite .",
    "it is one of the most thoroughly tested and understood 1p - kmc models ( e.g. the refs .",
    "@xcite ) for which we have already performed a sensitivity analysis@xcite .",
    "this makes it well - suited for testing our scheme and we can concentrate on discussing the peculiarities of the employed sampling approaches .    in detail , the model considers two kinds of adsorption sites , the so - called bridge ( br ) and coordinatively un - saturated ( cus ) sites .",

    "the reaction rates for all elementary steps can be found in the supplementary material@xcite .",
    "we now turn to the problem of estimating the drs from kinetic monte carlo simulations .",
    "as written above , we propose a three - step strategy for that purpose .    in the first step , we estimate bounds for the drs using the relative entropy method as presented in section [ sec : bounds ] .",
    "the ingredients to these bounds are the pathwise fisher information metric and the time - integrated auto - correlation function ( tac ) of the reaction rate .",
    "especially , the later is not trivial to estimate and , in section [ sub : estimatortac ] , we present a sampling strategy based on a series expansion of a generalized inverse .    in the second step ,",
    "we try to directly sample all drs from a single trajectory . for this",

    "the bounds from the first step help here to reduce sampling overhead , because we can skip those drs which bounds are close to zero .",
    "we further utilize a numerical parameter , which we need to adjust during for the determination of the tac .",
    "the direct estimator might suffer from a too high variance for some sensitivities and we would need an unrealistic increase of the sampling effort to achieve an satisfactorily accuracy . in the third step , we therefore determine these sensitivities using coupled finite differences ( cfd ) @xcite , which might provide the desired variance with less sampling effort . however , we will need an extra kmc simulation for each drs and if we can determine the at least some drs sufficiently from direct sampling , we save computational costs .",

    ", we will follow an approach put forward by arampatzis , katsoulakis , and pantazis@xcite . for the drs ,",
    "their bound for a general parametric dependence specializes to @xmath93 where @xmath94 are the diagonal elements of the pathwise fisher information metric ( fim ) , and @xmath95 is the time - integrated auto - correlation of the reaction rate .",
    "when the transition matrices @xmath96 depend arbitrarily on a parameter vector @xmath97 , the fisher information metric is given by @xmath98 where the sum runs over all allowed events @xmath10 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "[ eq : partialtransitionrate ] and the logarithms of the rate constants as parameters , the above equation reduces to the reaction rates @xmath100 so , using bound [ eq : bounds ] will simply sort out those reactions which do not happen frequently enough . in the stationary case ,",

    "even only considering the fisher information matrix ( fim ) allows for a sensitivity analysis@xcite , albeit with a different objective .",
    "the fim measures the impact of a small change in the parameters on the whole stochastic process , i.e. the leading order of the relative entropy between the original and the perturbed process .",
    "this allows for a global picture , but if one is interested in a particular average , the fim based findings might be misleading .",
    "for example , consider the case with two types of sites @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which are completely decoupled .",

    "this allows for a intuitive microscopic interpretation . at these conditions ,",
    "the surface is fully oxygen covered and we need to get co onto the surface for a high tof with the employed langmuir - hinshelwood mechanism . to achieve this ,",
    "empty sites need to be created by one of the oxygen desorption processes and the most effective @xmath281 desorption has a positive drs .",
    "now , co and oxygen adsorption onto the created empty sites compete with each other .",
    "so , the @xmath282 adsorption has a negative drs as it blocks the more catalytically active configuration .",
    "the @xmath283 adsorption on cus sites has a positive sign , because it leads to configurations for which the @xmath284 reaction is possible .",
    "once a @xmath283 molecule is adsorbed on a cus site , we have a competition between desorption and the actual reaction .",
    "the desorption destroys the desired configuration and therefore has a negative sign .",
    "the @xmath284 has a positive sign , which now results from the two competing parts @xmath285 and @xmath148 .",
    "the direct relative contribution @xmath285 to the tof is always positive . at these low co partial pressures",
    "the @xmath284 reaction is responsible for almost all the reactivity and its relative contribution is therefore very close to one .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ all_bounds_pco ] , which shows the sensitivity bounds @xmath106 ( eq . [ eq : bounds ] ) , which are proportional to the square roots of reaction rates of each elementary step .",
    "the second is the contribution @xmath148 to the creation / annihilation of the desired configurations , which should be negative for this case because the reaction removes the co from the surface .",
    "this contribution is close to zero as the dominant channel of the co removal from the surface is the co desorption from cus sites , which has a higher frequency ( compare fig .",
    "[ all_bounds_pco ] ) .    at low co partial pressures",
    ", the cancellation of the drs for ad / desorption on cus sites suggests that these steps are close to equilibrated .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the bounds for the forward and backward rates , which are almost the same for co ad / desorption and oxygen ad / desorption on cus sites , respectively .",
    "as we increase @xmath82 , the co coverage on cus - sites also increases .",
    "although this coverage is still very low , the fast @xmath284 reaction becomes an alternative to the @xmath286-desorption for oxygen removal from the surface .",
    "this is reflected by the deviation of the bounds for @xmath286-desorption and @xmath286-adsorption in fig .",
    "[ all_bounds_pco ] . in consequence ,",
    "the drc for the pair of @xmath286-ad / desorption starts deviating from zero , as they are not equilibrated anymore .",
    "for the point at @xmath268bar , we speculated that its very close to a second order phase transition and the correlation time as well as fluctuations should increase as we approach this point .",
    "this results in an increase of the time - integrated auto - correlation ( tac ) , which is reflected in an increase of the bounds for most elementary steps . the same holds for most integrated response functions @xmath148 , and , in consequence , the absolute drs for the relevant elementary steps increase while approaching the `` critical point '' . for the drc in fig .",
    "[ all_bounds_pco ] for the @xmath287-ad / desorption , this results in a amplification of the effect of the slight deviation from equilibrium .",
    "the @xmath286-ad / desorption is much better equilibrated at low @xmath82 and therefore this amplification of the drc sets in at little higher @xmath82 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath287-ad / desorption , the increase in the absolute drc of the @xmath286-ad / desorption is more pronounced , because this reaction pair is additionally strongly driven out of equilibrium while approaching @xmath268bar .",
    "notably , the drc for the @xmath288 reaction shows a similar increase , when the co partial pressure exceeds the oxygen partial pressure @xmath85bar by a factor two to three .",
    "this means that the contribution @xmath148 by creation and annihilation of desired configuration must be positive for the @xmath288 reaction .",
    "this is in contrast to the case at low partial pressures , where it is negative ( but close to zero ) . at higher pressures ( @xmath289$]bar ) ,",
    "the presence of co on the surface is still critical as reflected by the positive drs for the @xmath287-adsorption .",
    "however , the removal of @xmath287 by the @xmath288 reaction is now compensated by the creation of two vacant cus - sites , which are are likely to be filled by @xmath283 .",
    "close to @xmath268bar , oxygen still dominates the surface and getting co onto the surface is still crucial , but we have already some kind of mixed composition with both @xmath283 and oxygen on the surface .",
    "we now have some co on the bridge sites , and consequently the fast @xmath290 reaction starts contributing to the overall tof ( compare the supplementary material @xcite ) .",
    "oxygen is very strongly bound to the bridge sites and therefore covers these .",
    "the co adsorption on bridge site has a positive drs for two reasons : i ) it enables the @xmath290 reaction and ii ) it prevents oxygen to adsorb on the pair of vacant sites created by the later reaction . the corresponding @xmath291-desorption plays no role , because the @xmath290 reaction is significantly faster and removes most of the @xmath292 .",
    "the @xmath293 adsorption removes vacant sites , which are needed for the @xmath283-adsorption on both types of sites , resulting in a negative drs .",
    "the @xmath294 reaction has two effects .",
    "first it contributes slightly to the overall tof , second it it creates free bridge and cus sites , which are both likely to be filled with co. the @xmath290 reaction itself has no impact , because it is so fast that no other mechanism , which would destroy the @xmath286/@xmath291 pair , can compete with it .",
    "increasing the co partial pressure beyond @xmath252bar , the drs and drc of all species drop , because we are moving away from the point with the highest correlation and large fluctuations .",
    "further , we are increasing the co content on the surface , so that it becomes less and less important to get co onto the surface . at around @xmath295bar ,",
    "we reach a point , where all drs and drc are close to zero except for the @xmath288 reaction .",
    "as this is still the dominant contribution to the overall tof , we can interpret this point as the best mixed phase , where the appearance of appreciable configurations is largely unaffected by accelerating one of the elementary steps .",
    "a further increase leads then to a co dominated surface , where the drc identifies the @xmath286-adsorption as the rate - determining step . having a closer look at the results for the drs , this result",
    "is easily understood . on this co covered surface ,",
    "the crucial point is to get oxygen onto the surface .",
    "therefore the @xmath287-desorption has a positive impact , as it creates empty sites .",
    "oxygen adsorption onto cus - sites competes with co adsorption onto the same sites , i.e. the oxygen adsorption has a positive drs and the co adsorption has a negative drs .",
    "at high co partial pressures , co ad / desorption is equilibrated and their drs must cancel when summing to the drc .",
    "once on the surface , oxygen binds very strongly and is almost exclusively removed by forming co@xmath1 , with dominant reaction being the @xmath290 and smaller contributions by the @xmath288 reaction . due to the stronger",
    "binding of co to bridge sites ( compared to cus - sites ) , @xmath292-desorption is comparatively slow , so that vacancy pairs with one bridge site are rare and thus the competition between oxygen adsorption involving a bridge site and the @xmath292-adsorption does not play a big role .",
    "finally , we want to draw our attention to the question , which information could be extracted from only considering the bounds in fig . [ all_bounds_pco ] as sensitivity measures .",
    "as expected , the bounds overestimate the drs , often by more than one order of magnitude . on the plus side ,",
    "the five most important steps are correctly identified for low co pressures .",
    "also the steep increase of the most absolute drs is properly reflected by the bounds .",
    "the o@xmath296 desorption does not follow this trend and this is properly reproduced by the corresponding drs bound in fig . [ all_bounds_pco ] . for high co pressures ,",
    "the adsorption and desorption of co on cus - sites are ranked most important , but the oxygen adsorption on cus - sites is ranked only on place seven according to the fisher information metric ( fim ) based criterion .",
    "furthermore , a number of processes involving bridge sites are identified as important .",
    "we would therefore miss the important feature that only the kinetics on the cus sites determines the reaction rate for most of the considered reaction conditions .",
    "so , a fim based sensitivity analysis@xcite provides a first , more global insight into the reaction kinetics , but a detailed picture of the microscopic reaction pathways requires a deeper analysis .",
    "we have presented a three stage procedure to determine local sensitivity indices , specifically the degree of rate sensitivity , from which other sensitivity measures as the degree of rate control can easily be derived . in the first stage ,",
    "bounds for the drss are obtained to eliminate those drss which are close to zero . in the second stage ,",
    "the remaining drss are estimated using a direct sampling approach , which is based on an truncated series expansion of time - integrated linear response functions .",
    "only those drss which can not accurately enough be estimated in the previous stages , are finally obtained using coupled finite differences .",
    "the devised approach can lead to significant computational savings , compared with the straightforward approach employing solely numerical derivatives .",
    "we have demonstrated the approach on the example of the co oxidation on ruo@xmath1(110 ) . comparing with with our previous study for the sensitivity analysis of the same model@xcite , we arrive at significantly more accurate estimates for the sensitivity indices in a fraction of the cpu - time . for this model ,",
    "we have also demonstrated , that the detailed information obtained during the three stage procedure can be used to derive a detailed interpretation of the nature of the microscopic reaction kinetics .",
    "we found that the drs criterion is a suitable complement to the more common drc and allows to explain , why a step is rate - determining .",
    "the methods for sampling the bounds and the irf approach have been implemented into the open - source kmc package kmos and we are currently preparing it to become part of the next publicly available update .",
    "the cfd has been implemented using just the front - end and future development will target at allowing for a more efficient implementation but also at alternative coupling strategies@xcite .",
    "also some effort needs to be directed towards a more balanced strategy minimizing the overall computational costs .",
    "see supplementary material for additional information on the derivations of series expansions of the tac and the irf and the pseudocode for their sampling as well as for the drs sum rule .",

    "<S> the result of such a sensitivity analysis quantitatively expresses the dependency of the turnover frequency , being the main output variable , on the rate constants entering the model . in the past the application of sensitivity analysis , such as degree of rate control , has been hampered by its exuberant computational effort required to accurately sample numerical derivatives of a property that is obtained from a stochastic simulation method . in this study </S>",
    "<S> we present an efficient and robust three stage approach that is capable of reliably evaluating the sensitivity measures for stiff microkinetic models as we demonstrate using co oxidation on ru@xmath0(110 ) as a prototypical reaction . in a first step </S>",
    "<S> , we utilize the fisher information matrix for filtering out elementary processes which only yield negligible sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> then we employ an estimator based on linear response theory for calculating the sensitivity measure for non - critical conditions which covers the majority of cases . </S>",
    "<S> finally we adopt a method for sampling coupled finite differences for evaluating the sensitivity measure of lattice based models . </S>",
    "<S> this allows efficient evaluation even in critical regions near a second order phase transition that are hitherto difficult to control . </S>",
    "<S> the combined approach leads to significant computational savings over straightforward numerical derivatives and should aid in accelerating the nano scale design of heterogeneous catalysts . </S>"
