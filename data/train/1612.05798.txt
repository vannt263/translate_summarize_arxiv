    "neoclassical tearing modes are large - scale magnetohydrodynamical instabilities that cause the axisymmetric , toroidally - nested , magnetic flux - surfaces of a tokamak plasma to reconnect to form helical magnetic island structures on low mode - number rational magnetic flux surfaces.@xcite island formation leads to a degradation of plasma energy confinement.@xcite indeed , the confinement degradation associated with neoclassical tearing modes constitutes a major impediment to the development of effective operating scenarios in present - day and future tokamak experiments.@xcite neoclassical tearing modes are driven by the flattening of the temperature and density profiles within the magnetic separatrix of the associated island chain , leading to the suppression of the neoclassical bootstrap current in this region , which has a destabilizing effect on the mode.@xcite the degree of flattening of a given profile ( i.e. , either the density , electron temperature , or ion temperature profile ) within the island separatrix depends on the ratio of the associated perpendicular ( to the magnetic field ) and parallel transport coefficients.@xcite    the dominant contribution to the perpendicular transport in tokamak plasmas comes from small - scale drift - wave turbulence , driven by plasma density and temperature gradients.@xcite the fact that the density and temperature profiles are flattened within the magnetic separatrix of a magnetic island chain implies a substantial reduction in the associated perpendicular transport coefficients in this region .",
