    "quantum theory of gauge fields ( qtgf ) is a widely recognized basis of the elementary particle physics .",
    "qtgf is based on the thesis that all the known interactions in nature are transferred by means of gauge fields .",
    "the principle of gauge symmetry is one of the most important heuristic principles .",
    "the considerable success in understanding properties of electromagnetic and weak interactions was achieved by using the gauge invariance principle .",
    "this principle implementation led to the modern electroweak interaction theory .",
    "quantum electrodynamics ( qe ) as a important part of qtgf was formed in order to describe electromagnetic ( em ) and charged matter fields interactions . the considerable breakthrough in the description of em interactions",
    "was achieved on the basis of the following assumption : the interaction of a gauge field with fundamental matter fields has a local nature .",
    "however , the matter fields that form the nature variety are of nonlocal formation and closely related to the strong interaction .",
    "thus , there is an additional uninvestigated interaction in em processes , which forms a bounded state and at the same time is an origin of all difficulties in using the lagrangian approach .",
    "the approach that considers a possibility to construct an analogous lagrangian that describes a nonlocal and em field interaction was proposed in the papers @xcite .",
    "it satisfies the universality principle .",
    "the method is based on bringing into consideration the theory of fiber spaces , in which an electromagnetic field vector - potential provides a connection . due to the fact that the electric charge can not be separated from the mass and , consequently ,",
    "it is not an independent quantity , it is necessary to consider additionally the movements in associated charge space , while describing the particles movement in the base space . as the result of these operations it was succeed to harmonize the 4-momentum and charge conservation laws in the amplitude of processes . in the papers @xcite , using generalized feynman rules ,",
    "the mentioned approach was applied to describe a photodisintegration processes of light nuclei into fragments .",
    "it is also necessary to follow the requirement of a general covariance and dynamically take into account the requirement of a gauge invariance , while considering the electromagnetic field and nonlocal matter fields interaction .",
    "the only and unknown parameter is the vertex that describes the collapse of strongly interacting particles .",
    "the dependence of the vertex from the fragments space - like four - momentum allowed us to keep invariance of the approach irrespective of its explicit form .",
    "several points that are infusion into the theory by new approach , or , to be more precise , by the regular ( pole ) part of the amplitude , should be noted .",
    "momentum distributions of the components in various nonlocal fields of matter are individual and contain information about the steady - state interactions in a coupled system .",
    "they also reflect a spatial and time evolution of a coupled system during the whole energy and structure range .",
    "the information for the each nonlocal field is determined by the following things : the decrement of the momentum distribution function , its rate of change and the nature of the curve curvature ( its convexity or concavity ) .",
    "another established property of the generalized gauge - invariant pole amplitude , which occurs independently of the explicit form of vertex function , is related to the degree of its increase or decrease .",
    "the relative sign between the pole and regular parts in the amplitude is fixed by the total electromagnetic current conservation requirement .",
    "if the vertex function of the strong interaction is constant , then the regular part in the amplitude turns into a zero . at the same time",
    "the pole part is determined by yukawa asymptotic behavior - a constant that is divided by the pole . for decreasing functions its",
    "derivative is negative",
    ". this fact changes the sign in the amplitude for the regular part , making the sign equal to the sign of the pole part . in this case",
    ", the contribution from the regular part to the total cross section is constructive ( positive interference ) . in the case ,",
    "when the vertex function increases with the argument increase , its derivative is positive and the contribution to the cross section is changed to the destructive one .    to sum up",
    ", the regular component of the generalized pole amplitude is a dynamic measure of the nonlocality of a bound state .",
    "it shows how `` quickly '' the structural formations of the initial level of matter structure lose their identity upon transition to the other scale of spatial and temporal localization .",
    "the amplitude regular component introduces an additional dependence from the vertex function in the form of its derivative .",
    "it was established in the paper @xcite that for the electric dipole splitting contribution from the regular part to the full amplitude at low energies is determined by the derivative from the strong interaction vertex . if the electric dipole transition is absent ( the case of splitting into two identical fragments ) than a regular part contribution to the total amplitude is determined by the second derivative from the strong interaction vertex .",
    "investigation of interaction processes of the em field with nuclei appears to be the important method .",
    "it helps to solve the vast number of nuclei and elementary particle physics issues .",
    "namely : an understanding of the role of different reaction mechanisms , a revision of different nuclei models , an obtaining of information about nucleon - nucleon interaction , an analysis of the structure of nuclei wave functions , an understanding of the role of quark configurations and non nucleon degrees of freedom in nuclei , etc . in the theoretical aspect",
    ", this method possesses the significant advantage  we can consider processes with the bounds of perturbation theory using the constant of the em interaction .",
    "especially valuable results can be obtained while investigate em interactions of few - nucleon systems .",
    "the special place in nuclear physics belong to these systems for the number of reasons . some of them are the relative simplicity of structure of such nuclei and the possibility to find the precise solution for the tree- or four - body problem .",
    "thus , applying the proposed theory we considered two - particle photodisintegration processes of he-4 in our paper",
    ". a close fit of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements on differential and total cross sections for these reactions was obtained by using a minimum number of parameters .",
    "the process @xmath1 is characterized by the fact that due to isospin selection and identity of particles in a final state the electric dipole moment is suppressed and the process realizes mostly due to quadrupole @xmath2-ray absorption . therefore , this channel is of a considerable interest to study the nature of a quadrupole transition .    for the compact cross - section notation of the process",
    "@xmath1 it is convenient to use spiral amplitudes , which were obtained in cartesian coordinate system when the @xmath2-quantum momentum is directed along @xmath3-axe and the first deuteron momenta is situated in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "initially , we defined the following matrix :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 are spiral amplitudes of the @xmath1 process , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are helicities of a @xmath2-quantum , first and second deuterons respectively , and @xmath9 is a polarization density matrix of a @xmath2-quantum .",
    "the differential cross section of the @xmath1 process in the case when a @xmath2-ray is polarized in an arbitrary way in the center - of - mass system ( see the fig.[fig:1 ] ) is :    @xmath10    where : @xmath11     process in the center - of - mass system . ]    using the eq.[eq:1 ] and the explicit form of a photon polarization density matrix we obtained :    @xmath12    in order to write down the amplitude of the process @xmath1 we followed the approach described in the paper @xcite . in this paper the problem of ensuring a gradient invariance of the amplitude was solved by choosing the next reaction mechanism : the contact diagram was added to the known field - theoretic row .",
    "this diagram takes into account multiparticle effects , including the electromagnetic interaction with the `` carriers of strong interaction '' .",
    "rooting from this approach , the amplitude , which satisfies the principles of relativistic and gradient invariance , was determined by the sum of a contact and pole diagrams , which are shown on the fig.[fig:2 ] .     reaction . ]    the matrix element pole part of these diagrams is characterized by the two electromagnetic vertices @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the strong one - @xmath15",
    ". the explicit form of these vertices can be obtained by the use of argonne @xcite or urbana parametrization . to obtain these vertices using the urbana parametrization we used data from the @xcite .",
    "the following parametrization of functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 is possible : @xmath18 @xmath19 where parameters @xmath20;@xmath21 .",
    "the fig.[fig:3 ] shows the functions @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 dependence , where solid lines represent the approximation of real values that marked as dots .        taking into account the expressions for vertices @xcite we estimated the following matrix elements corresponding to the pole s- , t- and u - channel diagrams :    @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 are mandelstam variables , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are a deuteron and a helium nucleus masses respectively , @xmath31 .",
    "the matrix element which corresponds to the contact diagram is presented in the integral form :    @xmath32 @xmath33,\\ ] ]    in the above - mentioned model the full amplitude of the process @xmath1 is determined by the following sum : @xmath34 . a differential and a total cross - sections were calculated by substitution the full amplitude into the eq.[eq:2 ] .",
    "the fig.[fig:4 ] shows a differential cross section angular dependence of the process @xmath1 at photon energies in lab system @xmath35 mev for the case when a @xmath2-quantum is linearly polarized .",
    "a qualitative description of the experimental angular distribution was obtained : the correct location of the cross - section minimum at @xmath36 and maximums at @xmath37 .",
    "differential cross section at @xmath35 mev , solid lines - include contact part , dash lines - without it.,width=384,height=288 ]    quadrupole transition can be investigated by the analysis of the differential cross - section at angles @xmath38 and @xmath39 . to thoroughly investigate the nature of the dipole transition we should proceed to the next section .",
    "to estimate the differential cross - section of the processes @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a nucleon(either @xmath44 or @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 is either @xmath47 or @xmath48 , we have to write down the corresponding matrix element .",

    "electromagnetic currents were defined in a standard way : @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the charge and anomalous magnetic moment of a particle @xmath58 ; @xmath59 is a charge of a @xmath0 .",

    "they describe the virtual collapse of a @xmath0 into @xmath67 and , due to relativistic invariance depend on the square of a relative four - momentum .",
    "it is also should be noted that in the case when @xmath68 we have @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the sum of pole diagrams is a gauge - invariant quantity .",
    "we parameterized our vertex function on the basis of the paper @xcite .",
