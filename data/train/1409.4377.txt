    "it is well known that gaussian probability density functions ( pdfs ) provide fundamental solutions of the heat ( or diffusion ) equation for homogeneous media @xcite or the more general fokker - planck - kolmogorov equation @xcite for linear stochastic systems driven by a wiener process .",
    "this connection between gaussian pdfs and linear second - order partial differential equations ( pdes ) is a source of various integro - differential identities . in statistical signal processing ,",
    "such relations attracted attention more than fifty years ago in the context of evaluating the generalized moments ( that is , expectations of arbitrary nonlinear functions ) of gaussian random variables and became known under the generic name of price s theorem @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "the identities , which constitute price s theorem , relate the derivatives of the generalized moments with respect to the covariances of the gaussian random variables with the expectations of the second - order derivatives of the nonlinear function .",
    "the latter moments can be easier to compute ( for example , in the case of polynomials ) .",
    "moreover , if the function satisfies a linear pde with constant coefficients , then a `` dual '' pde can be derived for the corresponding generalized moment .",
    "this , in principle , allows the moment to be computed ( or the structure of its parameter dependence to be found ) by solving a boundary value problem for the dual pde , where the boundary conditions are obtained by using extreme values of the parameters of the gaussian distribution , for which the moment is amenable to direct calculation .",
    "a similar problem of averaging nonlinear functions of quantum variables often arises in the context of quantum stochastic systems @xcite .",
    "these are models of open dynamical systems with noncommutative variables , which evolve in time and interact with their environment according to the laws of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "for example , gaussian stochastic linearization @xcite of such systems , with dynamic variables satisfying the heisenberg canonical commutation relations ( ccrs ) @xcite , employs mixed moments of the system variables and the hamiltonian operators over gaussian quantum states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the performance criteria in quantum formulations of risk - sensitive dissipativity analysis and filtering / control design @xcite are organised as exponential moments of quadratic forms of quantum variables and are concerned with gaussian quantum states in the case of linear systems @xcite . a straightforward extension of price s theorem to the quantum mechanical setting is complicated by the nontrivial problem of evaluating a nonlinear function ( of several classical variables ) at noncommutative quantum variables . in fact , such evaluation can be carried out in different ways , leading to different results which depend on additional conventions on ordering of the variables in their products , such as wick s normal order and the related kohn - nirenberg calculus @xcite .    in the present paper , we show that a quantum analogue of price s theorem can be established in the framework of the weyl functional calculus @xcite , which extends classical functions to quantum variables ( satisfying the heisenberg ccrs ) by using the fourier transforms .",
    "more precisely , the quantum mechanical derivation combines the fourier transforms with the quantum quasi - characteristic functions @xcite of gaussian quantum states .",
    "this is similar to the role of characteristic functions in one of the proofs of the classical version of price s theorem in @xcite . the resulting quantum version of price s theorem extends its particular cases which are known in quantum optics ( where they are usually formulated in terms of the annihilation and creation operators ) ;",

    "the integro - differential identities , which are known under the generic name of price s theorem , are based on the following relations between the derivatives in ( [ dp / dmu ] ) and ( [ dp / dsigma ] ) and the gradient vector and hessian matrix of the gaussian pdf in ( [ p ] ) with respect to the state variables : @xmath24 note that the first of these equalities is valid for an arbitrary differentiable ( not necessarily gaussian ) pdf @xmath25 which involves @xmath13 as a shift parameter . however , the second equality in ( [ dp / dx ] ) is a manifestation of the role which _ gaussian _ pdfs play as fundamental solutions of the heat ( or diffusion ) pdes @xcite for homogeneous anisotropic media : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a positive definite matrix of thermal conductivity ( or diffusivity ) , and @xmath28 describes the temperature ( respectively , concentration ) at time @xmath29 and location @xmath30 . the fundamental solution of this pde is provided by the gaussian pdf @xmath31 ( the corresponding gaussian distribution converges weakly to the atomic probability measure concentrated at the origin of @xmath1 as @xmath32 ) .",
    "the solution of the initial value problem for the pde ( [ heat ] ) with a continuous initial condition @xmath33 ( growing not too fast at infinity ) is described by the convolution of the latter with the heat kernel @xmath34 : @xmath35 indeed , by letting @xmath36 for all @xmath37 ( with the time derivative @xmath38 ) , and combining the chain rule for composite functions with the second of the equalities ( [ dp / dx ] ) , it follows that @xmath39 now , suppose the function @xmath40 in ( [ g ] ) is twice continuously differentiable and there exists @xmath41 such that the hessian matrix of @xmath40 satisfies @xmath42 this condition at infinity ensures the convergence and parametric differentiability for the following improper integrals : @xmath43 where use is made of ( [ dp / dx ] ) and the integration by parts . since ,",
    "as mentioned before , the first equality in ( [ dp / dx ] ) holds for arbitrary differentiable pdfs with a shift parameter @xmath13 , the identity ( [ price1 ] ) does not essentially employ the gaussian nature of @xmath16 .",
    "however , ( [ price2 ] ) is indeed specific for gaussian pdfs and implies that the partial derivatives of the generalized moment @xmath44 in ( [ g ] ) with respect to the entries @xmath45 of the covariance matrix @xmath46 satisfy the integro - differential relations @xmath47 which constitute price s theorem .",
    "note that the @xmath48-factor is absent from ( [ jk ] ) due to the symmetry of the covariance matrix @xmath17 and the hessian matrix @xmath49 . indeed , for any given indices @xmath50 , the first variation of @xmath44 with respect to @xmath45 is @xmath51 which implies ( [ jk ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath52 is the corresponding variation of @xmath17 , and @xmath53 denotes the @xmath54th standard basis vector in @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , if the function @xmath40 is @xmath55 times continuously differentiable and , together with its partial derivatives up to order @xmath56 , satisfies ( [ decay ] ) , then repeated differentiation of ( [ jk ] ) leads to @xmath57 for all @xmath58 ; cf .",

    "the identities ( [ price1])([jkl ] ) allow the moment @xmath59 of the gaussian random vector @xmath7 in ( [ g ] ) to be found by using the other moments , associated with the derivatives of the function @xmath40 , which can be easier to compute ( for example , if @xmath40 is a polynomial ) .",
    "more generally , if the function @xmath40 satisfies a linear pde with constant coefficients , then a `` dual '' pde can be derived for the function @xmath59 .",
    "this , in principle , allows @xmath59 to be found as a solution to the boundary value problem for the dual pde , where the boundary conditions can be established by using those values of the parameters of the gaussian distribution for which the moment lends itself to a straightforward calculation , for example , from symmetry considerations .",
    "we will now demonstrate this technique ( in a similar fashion to the use of pdes in the proof of the main theorem in @xcite ) for the moment - generating function of the gaussian distribution : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is fixed but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "the function @xmath40 satisfies the following pdes @xmath62 therefore , by applying price s theorem ( [ price1 ] ) and ( [ price2 ] ) to ( [ momgen ] ) , and using ( [ fpde ] ) , it follows that the function @xmath59 satisfies the dual pdes @xmath63 since the moment @xmath59 in ( [ momgen ] ) takes positive values , the pdes ( [ gpde1 ] ) and ( [ gpde2 ] ) are representable in an equivalent logarithmic form : @xmath64 the right - hand sides of these two pdes are independent of @xmath13 and @xmath17 , and hence , their general solution @xmath65 is an affine function of @xmath13 and @xmath17 : @xmath66 the additive constant @xmath67 , which depends on @xmath68 , is calculated as @xmath69 from the boundary condition @xmath70 .",
    "the latter follows from the fact that the gaussian random vector @xmath7 collapses to zero as @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , ( [ logg ] ) leads to the well - known expression for the moment generating function in ( [ momgen ] ) : @xmath73 also note that price s theorem admits a dynamic formulation for a gaussian random process @xmath7 . in this",
    "setting , the mean vector @xmath13 , the covariance matrix @xmath17 and the generalized moment @xmath59 in ( [ g ] ) acquire dependence on time , and the total time derivative of @xmath59 can be computed by combining the chain rule with ( [ price1 ] ) and ( [ price2 ] ) as @xmath74 in particular , this relation becomes a directly verifiable identity for quadratic functions @xmath40 .",

    "<S> the quantum counterpart of the theorem is established for gaussian quantum states in the framework of the weyl functional calculus for quantum variables satisfying the heisenberg canonical commutation relations . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum mechanical version of price s theorem relates the frechet derivative of the generalized moment of such variables with respect to the real part of their quantum covariance matrix with other moments . as an illustrative example , </S>",
    "<S> we consider these relations for quadratic - exponential moments which are relevant to risk - sensitive quantum control .    price s theorem , quantum variables , canonical commutation relations , weyl quantization , gaussian quantum state , generalized moment , integro - differential identity , quadratic - exponential moment . </S>"
