    "the issue addressed in this paper concerns the direct interpretation of an asteroseismic signature of helium ionization in terms of an ionization - induced property of the stratification of the star that produces that signature .",
    "the knowledge so obtained is important for designing calibrations of theoretical stellar models against seismic data ( together with other astronomical data ) , for the purposes of obtaining estimates of some of the gross properties of stars , such as their ages and their chemical compositions .",
    "the first approach that might come to mind is to adjust apparently appropriate parameters of the stellar models in such a way as to minimize some measure of deviation of the individual theoretical oscillation eigenfrequencies from the observed frequencies . without careful regard to the extent",
    "to which those frequencies are influenced by the stellar properties in mind , namely the helium abundance @xmath4 in this discussion , this naive procedure can hardly be optimal , although it has been used : it was first carried out for the sun , by @xcite , who simply minimized the frequency misfit by least squares .",
    "the procedure has the merit of being simple to execute , but it is subject to all the uncertainties in stellar modelling , some of which need not necessarily be very pertinent to the objective of the calibration .",
    "it is more prudent to aim to work instead with certain combinations of frequencies that are insensitive to the irrelevant properties of the stellar modelling .",
    "commonly used have been the so - called large and small frequency separations , which are relatively insensitive to the uncertain state of the outer layers of the stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) illustrated how from a knowledge of these separations one could in principle estimate the mass and age of a main - sequence star , provided that its chemical composition were known ; indeed , in the early days of helioseismology these separations were often preferred to the raw frequencies for solar calibrations @xcite .",
    "but the chemical composition of a star , particularly the helium abundance , is often not well known , and it is therefore incumbent upon us to devise more reliable ways of determining it , especially in view of the high - precision data anticipated from the imminent space missions corot ( convection rotation and planetary transits ; @xcite ) and kepler @xcite , and from the ground - based campaigns such as song ( grundahl et al .",
    "2006 ) and those of the kind organized by kjeldsen , bedding and their colleagues ( e.g. kjeldsen et al .",
    "2005 ) . even in the sun , in",
    "which helium was discovered by j.n .",
    "lockyer and p.j.c .",
    "janssen in prominences observed during the eclipse of 1868 , the spectroscopic determination of @xmath4 remains elusive to this day .",
    "this comes about because helium spectrum lines are formed well above the photosphere , in the much hotter chromosphere and corona where the deviation from local thermodynamic equilibrium can be severe , and where the helium abundance is not even necessarily the same as in the layers beneath the visible surface .    in principle",
    ", a direct seismological signature of @xmath4 in the envelope of a ( sufficiently cool ) star can be sought through its effect on the sound speed , via the depression of the value of the first adiabatic exponent @xmath0 induced by ionization , particularly if the depression occurs in an essentially adiabatically stratified region of a convection zone .",
    "the variation is seismically abrupt , in the sense that , at least for lower - frequency modes , its radial extent is less than or comparable with the inverse radial wavenumber of the eigenfunctions .",
    "we call such a feature an acoustic glitch .",
    "it causes a small shift in the eigenfrequencies , relative to those in a corresponding putative star with no ionization , that shift being an oscillatory function of the frequency itself .",
    "the amplitude of that function increases monotonically with @xmath4 , and should therefore be a robust indicator of the value of @xmath4 ; the frequency of the function is determined by the acoustic depth of the centre of ionization beneath the seismic surface of the star .",
    "oscillatory components are produced also by other acoustic glitches , such as that at the base of the convection zone which is caused by a near - discontinuity in the gradient of the density scale height .",
    "they are evident in the large separations @xmath5 between the cyclic eigenfrequencies @xmath6 of seismic oscillations of order @xmath7 and degree @xmath8 , complicating the measurement of the underlying smooth component of @xmath9 , and also of other diagnostics such as the small separation @xmath10 .",
    "not taking them into account leaves an undulation in the outcome of data - fitting when plotted against the extremities of the range of frequencies employed @xcite , which could lead to misinterpretation .",
    "therefore it is prudent to separate the smooth and the oscillatory components , using the two of them as complementary diagnostics .",
    "we address in this paper a way in which that separation could be carried out , by analysing signatures suggested by asymptotic analysis of the eigenfrequencies of a grid of solar models , with the intention of determining parameters that are good measures of the variation of the stratification in the second helium ionization zone that are not unduly contaminated by other properties .",
    "direct seismological signatures of the helium abundance in the solar interior have been constructed from intermediate - degree acoustic modes by various techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in distant stars , however , only low - degree modes can be observed , and we need to find a diagnostic in only those modes , a need which has been stressed before by e.g. @xcite . one procedure is to attempt a direct inversion of low - degree modes for the helium abundance @xmath4 , using the constraint that the bulk of the convection zone is adiabatically stratified @xcite .",
    "more commonly , the outer phase function @xmath11 in the asymptotic relation @xmath12 @xcite has been used , for it exhibits explicitly the oscillatory components of @xmath13 induced by ionization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; here @xmath13 is the angular frequency of a mode of order @xmath7 and degree @xmath8 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a function of @xmath16 which depends also on the structure of the star .",
    "the idea is to determine @xmath17 by fitting the functional form of its asymptotic relation to the seismic data ( cf .",
    "it is evident from that relation that @xmath18 ( and @xmath19 ) can be determined from data @xmath20 only up to an unknown additive constant , so @xcite proposed using the derivative @xmath21 , which contains the same information and is more elegant .",
    "the oscillatory component can be largely separated by appropriate filtering ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and the contribution from helium ionization used to calibrate stellar models to determine @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative procedure is to consider the second frequency difference , @xmath22 @xcite , or even higher - order differences @xcite , which are much simpler to extract from the data than the phase functions @xmath17 and @xmath23 yet appear to contain the same information .",
    "it has been found expedient to model their oscillatory components with parametrized functions derived from representations of the acoustic glitches , and then to determine the sought - for properties of the star by calibrating the parameters corresponding to a sequence of stellar models against the seismic data .",
    "various approximate formulae for the seismic signatures that are associated with the helium ionization have been suggested and used , by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , not all of which are derived directly from explicit acoustic glitches .",
    "gough used an analytic function for modelling the dip in the first adiabatic exponent .",
    "in contrast , @xcite assumed a triangular form , which was adopted also by @xcite , @xcite and verneretal .",
    "these are the only two attempts to relate the low - degree seismic signature directly to the properties of the ionization zone , although the latter appears to be too crude to capture the physics adequately @xcite .",
    "@xcite , ballotetal.(2004 ) and @xcite have adopted a seismic signature for helium ionization that is similar to that arising from a single discontinuity in the sound speed ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is even less appropriate ; the artificial discontinuities in the sound speed and its derivatives that this and the triangular representations possess cause the amplitude of the oscillatory signal to decay with frequency too gradually , although that deficiency may not be immediately noticeable within the limited frequency range in which adequate asteroseismic data are or will imminently be available .",
    "however , any inappropriate representation of the seismic signature can hardly be trusted to measure the characteristic of the glitch that causes it .",
    "although the seismic quantities @xmath24 associated with low - degree modes and @xmath25 have been analysed in such a way as to enable the magnitude of the oscillatory components produced by helium ionization to be obtained , in none of the studies , save those of @xcite and @xcite , was the signature related directly to the form of the acoustic glitch that produced them .",
    "they were simply used as a medium for fitting theoretical models to seismic data , in the hope that the stellar properties of interest , such as @xmath4 , had been determined reliably .",
    "it has not been demonstrated whether the inferences are essentially uncontaminated by other properties of the star .",
    "our aim in this paper is to design a seismic signature that truly reflects the properties of the seismic glitches we wish to measure . and we report below that we have been reasonably successful .",
    "the next step in advancing our understanding would require a further independent study of stellar structure ( and the equation of state ) to ascertain how the glitch properties relate to @xmath4 .",
    "the glitch amplitude increases with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "however , we have found that the rate at which it does so depends also on other factors , such as the entropy of the adiabatically stratified ionization zones , as has been noted previously by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and that therefore the glitch amplitude alone is not a simple measure of  @xmath4 .    in sun - like stars ,",
    "the stratification in the helium ionization zones is very close to being adiabatic ( and reynolds stresses are negligible ) , and consequently changes @xmath26 in @xmath0 produce well defined changes in the variation of sound speed with radius .",
    "we note , in passing , that the ionization of hydrogen produces much greater @xmath0 variation , but unfortunately ( for this study ) the hydrogen ionization zone is not even approximately adiabatically stratified throughout ; the form of the seismic glitch must be susceptible to the uncertain formalism adopted to model the convective energy and momentum fluxes , and relating it to @xmath0 must therefore be unreliable .",
    "for that reason we concentrate on the ionization of helium , as have others before us .",
    "we represent the variation of @xmath0 with a pair of gaussian functions .",
    "this correctly results in a decay of the amplitude of the seismic signature with oscillation frequency that is faster than that which the triangular and the single - discontinuity approximations imply , and also takes some account of the two ionization states of helium .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the following section we introduce and derive a simple seismic diagnostic of a gaussian acoustic glitch produced by only the ( dominant ) second ionization of helium , together with a representation of the contribution from the base of the convection zone , the latter being derived in appendix[sec : delomc ] ; the variation of the eigenfunction phase @xmath27 with acoustic depth @xmath28 is first represented by the simple formula @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is taken to be constant .",
    "this diagnostic is tested against artificial frequency data computed from two sequences of theoretical solar models , which we describe in section[sec : testing ] .",
    "although the diagnostic can be fitted to the theoretical eigenfrequencies tolerably well , the inferred value of the acoustic depth @xmath31 of the glitch is too low , and the inferred amplitude @xmath32 is too high .",
    "this is as one might expect , partly because in this initial phase of the investigation we have adopted only a single gaussian function to represent the two ionization stages of helium , and partly because we have overestimated @xmath33 by not taking account of the acoustic cutoff frequency @xmath34 .",
    "we rectify this , in two steps , in section  4 , first by incorporating @xmath34 into @xmath27 , which essentially halves the discrepancy between the true @xmath31 and its seismologically inferred value , and also reduces the amplitude discrepancy considerably ( although it does not reduce the measure @xmath35 of the data misfit ) , and then by adding in a simple way a contribution to the diagnostic from the first stage of ionization of helium , which reduces the @xmath36 discrepancy by a factor three ( and also reduces @xmath35 ) .",
    "we must point out , however , that the value we must adopt for the ratio @xmath37 of the characteristic widths of the  and  glitches in order to obtain a good fit to the artificial data is rather larger than that suggested by the models .",
    "we do not know why , although a change of this kind is perhaps suggested by the functional form of the contribution to the depression of @xmath0 due to the ionization of hydrogen , which is depicted in fig.7 .",
    "we discuss our analyses further in section[sec : discussion ] , and we draw our conclusions in section[sec : summary ] .",
    "a convenient and easily evaluated measure of the oscillatory component is the second difference with respect to order @xmath7 of the cyclic frequencies @xmath6 of like degree @xmath8 : @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this measure is contaminated less than the first difference @xmath39 , otherwise known as the large frequency separation , by the smoothly varying components of @xmath40 ( here and henceforth we simplify the notation , where it is not ambiguous to do so , by omitting the subscripts @xmath41 ) . and",
    "it is less susceptible to data errors than the fourth and other higher - order differences ( see appendix[sec : dogcallsthisappxc ] ) ; moreover , adopting higher - order differences risks requiring more consecutive modes than might be available to provide a practical diagnostic .",
    "any localized region of rapid variation of the propagation speed of an acoustic wave , which here we call an acoustic glitch , induces an oscillatory component in @xmath3 with a ` cyclic frequency ' approximately equal to twice the acoustic depth @xmath42 of the glitch , where @xmath43 is a radial coordinate , @xmath44 is the adiabatic sound speed and @xmath45 is the radius of the seismic surface of the star ( essentially the surface on which @xmath46 , if extrapolated linearly outwards from the outer layers of the adiabatically stratified region of the convection zone , would vanish  cf .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillatory component depends on the amplitude of the glitch , and decays with @xmath1 once the inverse radial wavenumber of the mode becomes comparable with or greater than the radial extent of the glitch . by calibrating a theoretical representation of the effect of glitches against the observations one",
    "can , in principle , learn about the characteristics of those glitches . because only low - degree modes are used , the @xmath8-dependence can safely be ignored , even down to the base of the convection zone ( except , possibly , in very - low - mass , almost fully convective stars ) .",
    "we remark further on that in section[sec : discussion ] .",
    "+ if a frame of reference exists in which the basic structure of a star , which in general is presumed to be rotating ( but only slowly ) , is independent of time , then one can seek linearized adiabatic oscillations in that frame whose time dependence is sinusoidal with angular frequency @xmath13 .",
    "the adiabatic oscillation frequency @xmath13 is related to the displacement eigenfunction @xmath47 through a variational principle  @xcite , the derivation of the acoustic signature from which we now address .",
    "we consider the structure of the star to be described by smoothly varying functions upon which are superposed glitches , each varying on a small spatial scale .",
    "the contribution @xmath48 from those glitches to the eigenfrequency @xmath13 of a mode of oscillation ( with vanishing pressure gradient at the surface ) , can then be written ( see appendix[sec : varprin ] ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mode inertia and @xmath51 depends on the displacement eigenfunction @xmath47 and on the glitches in the equilibrium quantities , such as the ( localized ) perturbation @xmath52 to the first adiabatic exponent @xmath53 , @xmath54 being specific entropy , caused by ionization . in equation([eq : varprin3 ] ) , contributions from the surface ( which at most contribute a relatively smoothly varying component to @xmath3 ) have been ignored .",
    "we separate @xmath48 into a smoothly varying component @xmath55 and an oscillatory component @xmath56 : @xmath57 ( and we adopt a similar notation for other variables ) and we approximate , with a suitable eigenfunction normalization , the oscillatory component @xmath58 associated with helium ionization as follows : @xmath59 where @xmath60 with @xmath61 ( cf .",

    "we have confirmed numerically that the terms neglected in @xmath51 are indeed substantially smaller than @xmath65 ( although they may not be wholely negligible , as is evinced by the differences in @xmath66 in figs  [ fig : gamma2_nine - fit ] and [ fig : ff3 ] ) . in view of the variational principle",
    ", we have approximated the eigenfrequencies by those of a corresponding nonrotating smoothly varying ( i.e. having no glitches ) model star ; consequently in equations ( [ eq : k1 ] ) and ( [ eq : inertia ] ) we have been able to adopt the usual separation of the components of the eigenfunctions @xmath47 in terms of functions of @xmath43 and spherical harmonics , carry out the angular integrations , and regard @xmath47 to be a function of @xmath43 alone . in the asymptotic limit of high - order modes the ( suitably normalized ) radial component @xmath67 of the displacement eigenfunction @xmath47 and the associated lagrangian pressure perturbation @xmath68",
    "are given by(e.g .",
    "* ) @xmath69 where the phase function @xmath27 is given by @xmath70 in which here we have approximated the radial component of the wavenumber of high - order modes as @xmath71 , and we have assumed that @xmath43 is not close to @xmath72 , the upper turning point at which the mode is reflected ; @xmath30 is a phase constant ( strictly speaking , a phase variable , for it varies slowly with @xmath13 , but in the simple approach that we adopt in just this section that variation is ignored ) which takes some account of the fact that @xmath73 deviates substantially from @xmath74 near the upper turning point .",
    "it follows that @xmath75 and therefore equation([eq : k1 ] ) can be written in terms of @xmath76 in which the limits of integration are such as to include the region in which @xmath52 is nonzero ; moreover @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the acoustic radius of the star ( i.e. the sound travel time from the acoustic surface to the centre of the star ) .",
    "note that the normalization of this expression for the inertia differs from the usual .",
    "the neglect of the acoustic cutoff frequency in the expression for @xmath73 will be dropped in section 4.1 .",
    "however , we shall continue to neglect the degree - dependence , which is a good approximation for the low - degree modes detectable by asteroseismology ; we justify that neglect in section 5 .    in this introductory discussion",
    "we represent the acoustic glitch induced by the ( second ) ionization of helium by a gaussian function about the acoustic depth @xmath79 of the centre of the  ionization region ( see fig .  [",

    "we suspect that the remaining errors with the improved phase function have arisen because the actual models , and real stars too , are not polytropes : also there is some ambiguity in obtaining an appropriate location of the effective acoustic surface of the sun , and hence the origin of the coordinate @xmath28 , because that depends on precisely how the layers in the convection zone near the upper turning points influence the dynamics of the modes , and consequently how the region adopted for the extrapolation of @xmath46 or @xmath290 should be chosen ; moreover , the deviation of the stratification from the polytropic behaviour influences the relation between @xmath27 and our polytropic approximation throughout the convection zone , resulting in the errors in @xmath291 and @xmath203 being different .",
    "finally , we note that the value of @xmath113 inferred from the seismic calibration is @xmath292 too low , which is puzzling because we would expect the asymptotic expressions used to relate the discontinuity in the second density derivative to the amplitude of the oscillatory signature to work rather well .",
    "perhaps a significant source of the discrepancy is our neglect of the influence of the discontinuity in @xmath34 on the structure of the oscillation eigenfunctions ( see appendix b ) . in any case",
    ", we stress that the precision of the asteroseismic calibrations that are planned does not rely directly on the precision of the asymptotic expressions .",
    "those expressions have been used solely to design seismic signatures of certain properties of the stratification of a star to be as free from contamination by other properties as can reasonably be expected ; their role is to enable one to interpret the results of the calibrations , and to help in the assessment of the accuracy of the inferences .",
    "it is noteworthy that the slopes of the solid and dashed lines representing the behaviour of the two different sequences of solar models in the top three panels of figs  [ fig : gamma_nine - fit ] , [ fig : sd1ab ] , [ fig : sd1a_delphi ] , [ fig : gamma2_nine - fit ] and [ fig : ff3 ] are not parallel .",
    "the variations of @xmath31 and @xmath36 are both small , and can be influenced by details of the upper superadiabatic boundary layer in the convection zone , for example , which is not of principal concern here .",
    "but one might naively expect , and indeed hope , the values of @xmath176 to depend almost solely on the value of @xmath4 , for then the interpretation would have been simple .",
    "but that is evidently not the case",
    ". a substantial direct influence of heavy elements on the depression of @xmath0 by  ionization may be partially responsible .",
    "but it is likely that the predominant influence comes about through the dependence on the specific entropy @xmath54 of the adiabat deep in the convection zone , which is determined by the ( @xmath149-dependent ) calibration of the models to the solar radius and luminosity .",
    "we reiterate that nevertheless this result does not compromise the precision of the asteroseismic calibration , just its interpretation .",
    "it is no surprise that the slopes of @xmath293 and @xmath294 are different for the two sequences of solar models , because they depend on the interfacing of the convection zone with the radiative interior , and the latter is quite sensitive to the opacity , and hence to the value of @xmath149 ( and , therefore in a calibrated sequence of solar models , to @xmath4 ) .",
    "our investigation has been carried out with a single equation of state .",
    "although it can hardly be doubted that our signature of the magnitude of the depression in @xmath0 is quite robust , it is certainly the case that relating that to @xmath4 is less so .",
    "the value of @xmath176 is determined locally by the values of @xmath4 and @xmath54 , and the magnitude of the error in how they are related depends directly on the error in the equation of state at @xmath31 , although it is also due partly to the inaccuracy of our representation of the glitch ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_taylor ] ) .",
    "the error would certainly be adequately small for the asteroseismic calibrations of the foreseeable future . but to determine the value of @xmath4 does seem to require knowledge of @xmath54 , which can be determined only by an additional diagnostic .",
    "that diagnostic might have been dependent on uncertainties in conditions far from the  ionization zone , which may be difficult to assess .",
    "but fortunately the immediate environment of the helium ionization zone is isentropic , so one needs to determine only a constant , rather than a function : given @xmath54 ( and the gravitational acceleration , which hardly varies through the helium ionization zones of solar - like stars , and to a high degree of precision may be considered to be constant too ) , the functional form of @xmath0 is rather well constrained , and a simply measurable property of it , such as @xmath36 , might be used to obtain another , different , relation between @xmath4 and @xmath54 .",
    "that would enable each of these two quantities to be determined .",
    "the constancy of @xmath54 disengages the calibration from uncertainties elsewhere in the star .",
    "( we expect the value of @xmath31 to be less useful for these purposes , for it depends on conditions in the vicinity of the upper turning points of the modes ; it should , however , be useful as a diagnostic of the treatment of convection , which determines the structure of the superadiabatic boundary layers . ) however , before such a calibration is carried out , more thorough tests of the reliability of the inferred value of @xmath36 must be performed .",
    "essentially the same suggestion has been made already by @xcite to distinguish between equations of state , although they too offered no cogent reason to suggest whether it would provide a reliable test .",
    "if the hypothesis that we are putting forward is correct , this measure of the specific entropy would not alone necessarily provide a robust criterion for selecting any particular equation of state .",
    "however , it would certainly limit the uncertainty in the @xmath52@xmath4 relation needed for the asteroseismic calibration .",
    "we should also point out that the variation of @xmath0 in the he ionization zone would be influenced by the presence of a magnetic field , which we have ignored in this study .",
    "evidence for low - amplitude solar - cycle variations has been seen in the raw frequencies of a combination of solar models of both low and intermediate degree ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which relate directly to conditions in the  ionization zone @xcite , and , more recently , in fourth frequency differences @xcite",
    ". such variations could be greater in other stars , and would therefore noticeably contaminate the low - degree diagnostic .",
    "unless adequately accounted for , they would degrade any seismic calibration of @xmath4 .",
    "we emphasize that our aim in this work is not to invent a functional representation of the second frequency differences , the diagnostic of our choice , or of any other diagnostic for that matter , with the intention of merely being able to fit the data well .",
    "instead , it is principally to obtain a formula that can be related directly to properties of the stratification of the star that we believe to be pertinent to the abundance of helium .",
    "although the degree to which we succeed in fitting the data provides some measure of our success , it is not the sole criterion guiding our choice of function .",
    "indeed , functions that are not obviously directly related to the stratification but which are tailored to mimic the data should be almost bound to fit the data better .",
    "but evidently they must be less reliable for diagnosis .",
    "it is encouraging , however , that our function actually does fit the frequency data better than any other that has been tried before @xcite , particularly when the data are fitted over a large range of frequency , although we hasten to add that its ability to measure the acoustic glitches is not perfect . in",
    "this regard it is interesting to note that the fit to the golf data of @xmath148 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_golfd2 ] , is no better than the fit of @xmath207 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : golf ] , yet the values inferred for @xmath170 , @xmath31 and @xmath36 are likely to be superior .    finally , we emphasize that although our analysis is based on asymptotic theory , the actual calibrations would be carried out using numerically computed eigenfrequencies , and their precision would be independent of the accuracy of the asymptotics .",
    "as is often the case in asteroseismology , the role of the asymptotics is to motivate the design of a calibration procedure , and to facilitate its interpretation in physical terms ; it is not used in the calibration itself .",
    "we have designed asteroseismic signatures of helium ionization which we trust will provide a reliable basis for calibrating stars against a suitable grid of theoretical models , using second frequency differences @xmath295 .",
    "those signatures can be used to determine the magnitudes , widths and locations of the depressions @xmath52 of the first adiabatic exponent @xmath0 due to he ionization .    the degree",
    "to which our original simple diagnostic  ( [ eq:22 ] ) appears to reproduce the magnitude and width of the depression in @xmath0 in the  ionization zone can be judged by comparing the inferred values plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sd1ab ] with those measured from the models in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_nine - fit ] .",
    "the values of the amplitudes of the depression are overestimated by some 50% , and the widths underestimated by a similar amount , yielding an approximately correct magnitude of the glitch integral , @xmath81 .",
    "however , the slopes of the dependence of those values on helium abundance @xmath4 , particularly amongst models with varying heavy - element abundance @xmath149 , are not reproduced . in this regard",
    "it should be appreciated that the reason may actually be that our procedure for characterizing the amplitudes and widths of the depressions in the models may not be seismically appropriate .",
    "the variation of the acoustic depth @xmath31 of the centre of ionization is more - or - less reproduced .",
    "however , the actual magnitude appears to be discrepant ; that is due in part to our crude representation of acoustic phase , and perhaps in part to an uncertainty in the origin of @xmath28 .",
    "roughly half of that discrepancy is accounted for by our improved treatment of the phase , discussed in section  [ sec : iphase ] , as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : sd1a_delphi ] ) .",
    "that improvement also brings the amplitude of the @xmath0 depression almost into agreement with the model values , but the improvement in the inferred widths @xmath36 is only slight .",
    "we suspected that the problem with the widths arises from our explicit neglect of  ionization in our diagnostic formula , in which we represented the two distinct helium depressions , which in reality separately influence the oscillation eigenfrequencies , by a single gaussian function .",
    "however , we note that the variation of @xmath36 is less than the variation of the other ionization - related quantities , and may therefore perhaps not be a robust diagnostic .",
    "nevertheless , we have introduced a separate representation of  ionization in section  [ sec : heli ] , the result of which can be assessed by comparing with model values in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma2_nine - fit ] with the seismically inferred counterparts plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff3 ] .",
    "interestingly , the slope with respect to @xmath4 of the measured model values of @xmath31 for the @xmath149-varying sequence are changed , whereas that of the inferred values is not .",
    "moreover , the slope of the amplitudes of the inferred @xmath0 depressions in the @xmath149-varying sequence is improved only slightly .",
    "but the magnitude of the discrepancy between the inferred and the actual values of @xmath36 is reduced by a factor three .    we have found that , for solar - like stars at least , the magnitude of @xmath52 increases approximately linearly with helium abundance @xmath4 , a property which has assisted us in accounting for the  ionization zone by relating it directly to the contribution from  ionization .",
    "by so doing , a somewhat more faithful overall representation of the  ionization is achieved by the seismic calibration .",
    "the magnitude of the depression in @xmath0 is not a function of @xmath4 alone , but depends also on at least one more parameter .",
    "we argue that for a solar calibration there is just one , namely the specific entropy ; for other stars it must depend also on the gravitational acceleration , whose determination would be part of the overall calibration .",
    "if the situation is indeed that simple , then a potential asteroseismic calibration procedure is almost in hand .",

    "therefore the contribution to @xmath48 from a region of relatively rapid variation of @xmath0 produced by the ionization of an abundant element may be approximated by @xmath301 since @xmath302 , where @xmath303 @xmath304 and @xmath305 in which @xmath52 and @xmath306 are to be regarded as the differences between @xmath0 and @xmath63 in the equilibrium star and those in a similar smooth model in which ionization is absent . in view of the variational principle",
