    "why are the neutrinos much lighter than the charged leptons , but not absolutely massless ? it is universally recognized that this can be simply and elegantly understood in an @xmath1 effective theory .",
    "the most general , gauge - invariant interactions of dimension less than six , which can lead to masses for the known leptons from the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a higgs doublet , are : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the lepton doublet and singlet fields , and @xmath5 is the higgs doublet .",
    "the dimensionless matrix of yukawa couplings , @xmath6 , has a hierarchy of eigenvalues to describe the masses of the charged leptons .",
    "such a hierarchy could result by promoting the couplings to fields , @xmath7 , which acquire vevs to sequentially , spontaneously break the flavor symmetry @xmath8 .",
    "such a flavor symmetry will also result in a certain structure for the neutrino mass matrix via @xmath9 .",
    "the mass scale @xmath10 is the cutoff of the low - energy effective theory .",
    "the crucial point is that if this cutoff is very large , for example the planck or gauge coupling unification scale , then the neutrino masses are very small .",
    "while the charged lepton masses are linear in the higgs vev , @xmath11 , the neutrino masses are quadratic : @xmath12 the power of this effective field theory approach is that no assumption need be made about the full theory at or above the scale @xmath10 .",
    "the only assumption is that the low - energy theory is the most general allowed by its symmetries .",
    "nevertheless , there is a very simple theory which does lead to the dimension 5 operator of ( [ eq : leff ] ) .",
    "right - handed neutrino fields , @xmath13 , are introduced , with majorana masses @xmath10 and couplings to the lepton doublets : @xmath14 where @xmath10 and @xmath15 are mass matrices . on integrating out the heavy neutrinos",
    ", the well - known see - saw mechanism gives @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : leff ] ) by @xmath17 @xcite .    in supersymmetric theories ,",
    "there is a very important reason for questioning this simple view of neutrino masses : the low - energy effective theory must contain more fields than the leptons , higgs boson and their superpartners . in particular , there are two higgs doublet superfields , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and there is another sector of the theory which spontaneously breaks supersymmetry , and triggers electroweak symmetry breaking . at first sight",
    "these additions seem irrelevant to the question of neutrino masses , but closer inspection reveals new opportunities .",
    "an important objection to the minimal supersymmetric standard model is that it is not the most general low - energy effective theory consistent with @xmath20 gauge symmetry .",
    "the gauge symmetry allows a bare mass term for the higgs fields , @xmath21_f$ ] , giving the expectation @xmath22 , which removes the higgs from the low - energy theory .",
    "this is known as the `` @xmath0 problem '' in supersymmetric theories .    in this paper",
    "we take supersymmetry to be broken in a hidden sector , at the intermediate scale @xmath23 , via fields @xmath24 : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the planck mass .",
    "the supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the standard model by supergravitational interactions , so that the cutoff for the low - energy effective field theory is @xmath26 .",
    "this gives rise to the superpartner masses at the weak scale in the usual way . in this case , the above `` @xmath0 problem '' is easily solved by introducing a further global symmetry , @xmath27 , and dividing the light matter superfields into two types .",
    "there are fields which are chiral with respect to the gauge interactions , such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are guaranteed to be massless until the gauge symmetry is broken , and there are fields which are vector - like , such as @xmath28 , which are kept massless only via @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , the fields @xmath29 which break the flavor symmetry do not break @xmath27  the vector - like fields acquire mass only from supersymmetry breaking . there is a subset of the @xmath24 fields , which we call @xmath30 , that transform non - trivially under @xmath27 .",
    "this ensures that @xmath0 is of order the supersymmetry breaking scale , as it must be for electroweak symmetry breaking to occur successfully @xcite .",

    ", are vector - like with respect to the gauge interactions , hence the crucial question becomes how they transform under @xmath27 .",
    "if they are also vector - like with respect to @xmath27 , they will acquire a large mass , whence the see - saw proceeds via ( [ eq : l ] ) as usual .",
    "alternatively , they may be protected from acquiring a large mass by @xmath27 , in which case they will appear in the low - energy effective theory .",
    "the question of neutrino masses now becomes much richer , since it is necessary to study all possible interactions of @xmath3 and @xmath13 in the low - energy theory .",

    "it is possible that lepton - number violating dimension seven operators have important consequences , and we will discuss some of the consequences within the context of dark matter .    before we consider particular symmetries ,",
    "let us explore which combinations of operators are phenomenologically interesting .",
    "in later sections , we will exhibit particular symmetries which realize these scenarios . since @xmath13 must appear in combination with some of the @xmath56 superfields , @xmath57 .",
    "if we allow @xmath58 , when the @xmath56 get @xmath33 component vevs , this term will generate an intermediate scale mass for the @xmath13 scalar , @xmath59 , and this case is thus of less phenomenological interest .",

    "thus , for the same reasons we took @xmath61 , we do not consider the case where @xmath67 allows nonzero @xmath106 . ]",
    "we will refer to this scenario , in which the right - handed neutrinos have yukawas @xmath108 and weak scale majorana masses , as `` majorana mass from supersymmetry breaking '' , or smajorana for short .",
    "in section [ sec : bigsec ] , we concerned ourselves simply with the origin of neutrino mass itself , but did not address the additional question of what determines the structures of these masses when we include additional generations . as was discussed in the introduction",
    ", we are considering a scenario in which the global symmetry of the theory is @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath27 must include some symmetry to keep the higgs doublets and right - handed neutrinos light , and @xmath8 may include symmetries such as @xmath110 which relate the different generations .",
    "the key feature of our model is that the supersymmetry breaking spurions also contain charges under @xmath27 .",
    "when these spurions acquire @xmath33 , and possibly @xmath35 component vevs , they break @xmath27 .",
    "of course , they need not be charged merely under @xmath27 , but potentially under some larger group @xmath5 , where @xmath111 . in the most minimal framework , @xmath112 and would contain only those symmetries which are necessary to suppress the @xmath0 term and the right - handed neutrino masses , for instance @xmath113 in section [ sec : sdirac ] , or the @xmath47 symmetry in section [ sec : smajorana ] .    with such an assumption , the textures of the neutrino mass matrices and the @xmath35 terms would be determined by supersymmetry preserving elements of the theory .",
    "for instance , in the sdirac scenario , the couplings would be given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are supersymmetry _ preserving _ but flavor breaking spurions .",
    "as such , an explanation of structure of the yukawas and @xmath35 terms is beyond the scope of our scenarios .",
    "however , because of this , in the presence of a flavor symmetry , we are able to easily relate the structure of @xmath117 and @xmath118 .    however , in the smajorana case , the couplings will be given by @xmath119 here , the yukawas are precisely the same as the @xmath35 terms , but due to the potential mixing of the @xmath13 s , it is impossible to necessarily relate the @xmath35 term matrix to the neutrino mass matrix obtained by the see - saw mechanism .",
    "we consider this to be the minimal scenario , in which @xmath5 is as small as possible , so to speak .",
    "however , @xmath5 can easily be much larger .",
    "indeed , people have investigated the possible effects of baryon and lepton number violation operators from supersymmetry breaking @xcite . a priori",
    ", there is no reason why we should reject the possibility that @xmath120 . if that were the case , we would write the sdirac couplings as @xmath121 now the spurions @xmath30 and @xmath75 carry generation indices themselves !",
    "we assume that charged fermion yukawas are generated in a supersymmetry preserving sector of the theory .",
    "since the flavor structure of @xmath30 and @xmath75 is entirely determined in the supersymmetry breaking sector , they need not be aligned with those of the supersymmetry preserving yukawas .",
    "consequently , a large mixing between @xmath122 and @xmath123 is natural . of course",
    ", the small mixing between @xmath124 and this heavy state ( @xmath125 as required by chooz @xcite ) , must be viewed as somewhat of an accident , but not necessarily a fine - tuning .",
    "this is similar to the anarchy proposal of @xcite , except that here we need not relate the yukawas of @xmath126 and @xmath127 , and a hierarchy of eigenvalues could still possibly occur in @xmath30 .",
    "consequently , even for sdirac neutrinos , anarchic aspects of the theory are reasonable .",
    "whether this is compatible with supersymmetric flavor changing constraints is an important question .",
    "we will address this further in section [ sec : lfv ] .",
    "it is important to note that we do not need three right - handed neutrinos for the cases of sections [ sec : sdirac ] and [ sec : smajorana ] .",
    "the presence of just two @xmath13 states is enough to generate either two massive dirac or two massive majorana neutrinos .",
    "the remaining neutrino is simply a massless weyl neutrino . in a certain sense",
    ", this is more minimal than with three @xmath13 s , but the phenomenology is largely unchanged .",
    "one limit of this could be that there is , in fact , only one @xmath13 .",
    "here , one might generate majorana masses for the neutrinos through an ordinary @xmath128 see - saw , while a sdirac or ssterile @xmath13 would contribute a fourth mass eigenstate , resulting in four majorana neutrinos . given appropriate @xmath8 charges , other",
    ", more exotic possibilities may exist , such as combinations of sdirac and smajorana neutrinos .",
    "in the mssm , the sneutrino and charged slepton masses are intimately related : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the soft scalar mass for the left - handed sleptons . for @xmath131 , @xmath132 and the @xmath133-term splitting pushes the sneutrino mass down and the charged slepton mass up .",
    "the present experimental bound @xmath134gev still allows for light sneutrinos due to this splitting .",
    "however , if in the future it becomes established that @xmath135 is very large , much of the phenomenology associated with light sneutrinos will be ruled out in the mssm . in our model , with light right - handed sneutrinos , the story is quite different , both because the @xmath35 terms provide an additional source of splitting between the sneutrino and charged slepton masses , and because the right - handed sneutrino mass is not linked to slepton masses by gauge invariance .",
    "thus , even if @xmath130 is quite large it is still possible to have significant change in phenomenology that would otherwise be absent .    to better understand the spectrum",

    "an independent lower bound on the sneutrino mass in the mssm , @xmath138 gev , comes from the measurement of the invisible with of the @xmath24 , and is also altered by the addition of right - handed sneutrinos .",
    "the lightest sneutrino in our model is a superposition of left and right - handed states : @xmath139 if this state is light enough to be produced in @xmath24 decays , its contribution to the @xmath24 width is given by @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the @xmath24 width to ordinary neutrinos .",
    "if we take the current lep limit of @xmath142 @xcite , the @xmath143 factor allows us to evade the bounds regardless of mass provided @xmath144 , which is a very mild constraint .",
    "although @xmath130 , @xmath137 and @xmath35 are independent parameters , we can gain some intuition for their sizes from their renormalization group running .",
    "in fact , it is somewhat natural to have @xmath145 in the low - energy theory .",
    "the running of @xmath146 and @xmath147 is governed by @xmath148 @xmath149 where @xmath150 . since @xmath59 is a standard model singlet ,",
    "there are no gaugino loops to drive its mass upward as we run the energy scale down from @xmath26 to @xmath151 .",
    "likewise , there are new , sizeable loop diagrams arising from the @xmath35 terms ( figure [ fig : aloop ] ) , which push the soft masses down .",
    "however , two states ( @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) can propagate in the loop contributing to @xmath137 , while only one ( @xmath154 ) can propagate in the loop contributing to @xmath130 , pushing @xmath155 down faster than @xmath156 .",
    "in summary , the mass matrix can have two _ very _ different mass eigenstates , and there can be particles that couple very much like @xmath153 , but with suppressed couplings and masses unrelated to our expectations from the mssm . the lightest is likely to be dominantly @xmath59 , such that its mass is not restricted by @xmath24 decay data .",
    "one of the appealing features of r - parity conserving supersymmetric theories with gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking is that the lightest superpartner ( lsp ) is a good candidate for dark matter .",
    "searches for superheavy hydrogen have ruled out a charged lsp , leaving the neutralino and the sneutrino as candidates for dark matter .",
    "a number of direct searches for dark matter have been carried out @xcite which have essentially excluded sneutrino dark matter in the mssm unless @xmath157 gev . however , as we have already discussed , measurements of the invisible width of the @xmath24 exclude such a light sneutrino . within our framework",
    ", the @xmath24 width provides only a mild constraint , and we are free to explore the possibility of a light sneutrino dark matter candidate . a second , equally important",
    "point is that the @xmath158 suppression of the light sneutrino coupling to the @xmath24 boson greatly reduces the sneutrino - nucleon cross section , making it possible even for a heavier @xmath46 to evade direct detection .",
    "finally , if we include lepton number violation , the lightest sneutrino can not scatter elastically via @xmath24 exchange @xcite , further diminishing the limits from direct searches .",
    "sneutrino dark matter requires the presence of the @xmath35-term of ( [ eq : a ] ) , and hence is linked to the other phenomenology of the interaction",

    "we find it highly significant that for wino masses of roughly @xmath163 and angles roughly a half of the limit from the invisible @xmath24 width , we have a cosmologically interesting amount of sneutrino dark matter .",

    "the coupling of the higgs to nucleons is larger than just that from scattering off of valence quarks @xcite , but it is still quite small . using the numerical value for the higgs - nucleon coupling from @xcite , we find that the sneutrino - nucleon cross section obtained from higgs exchange alone is @xmath210 for broad ranges of parameters this cross section falls well below the current direct detection limits .",
    "for instance , it is quite reasonable to consider @xmath211 even for values of @xmath212 larger than those that allow one to evade cdms in the lepton - number conserving case .",
    "future experiments @xcite should be able to probe an additional three orders of magnitude down from the present constraint , giving a significant probe of sneutrino dark matter over a considerable range of parameters , for both the lepton - number conserving and lepton - number violating cases .    since the dominant annihilation process in the early universe is @xmath88-wave , there is little dependence of the relic abundance on the sneutrino mass given that the sneutrino is relatively light ( @xmath213 gev ) .",

    "another important difference is that if one supposes that the flavor structure of the @xmath35 coupling is similar to that of the neutrino masses , then one expects the charged higgs to decay into @xmath258 and @xmath259 with similar probabilities , leading to an excess of both @xmath0 s and @xmath246 s over @xmath127 s .",

    "the sneutrino pair production rate will be suppressed by a factor @xmath175 relative to its mssm value . by performing a scan in energy",
    "one would be able to see the @xmath279 signal turn on for an isolated sneutrino mass eigenstate .",
    "then , knowing the masses and mixings of the charginos and neutralinos , one could infer from the measured rate the value of @xmath212 , and demonstrate that the sneutrino produced is only partly left handed .",
    "if a heavier @xmath282 state is sufficiently split from a lighter @xmath283 , the unsuppressed @xmath35 term induces the decay @xmath284 , providing an interesting new way to produce higgs particles .",
    "one might wonder how efficient this method of producing higgs would be at the lhc , through cascade decays such as @xmath285 , @xmath286 , @xmath284 .",
    "the production cross section of squarks and gluinos at the lhc depends sensitively on their masses .",
    "taking @xmath287 gev , the cross section is @xmath288 nb at @xmath289 tev @xcite , roughly fifty times larger than the cross section for gluon fusion higgs production at that energy for @xmath290 gev in the decoupling limit @xcite , the regime we consider here .",
    "if @xmath291 gev , the cross sections are comparable .    assuming that @xmath35 is sizable and that @xmath292 , the question of whether or not there is an appreciable branching fraction for the cascades to produce @xmath293 depends largely on @xmath294 . for simplicity consider the case of a bino - like @xmath295 and wino - like @xmath272 and @xmath296 , and take @xmath282 and @xmath283 to be essentially left- and right - handed , respectively . if @xmath297 , then @xmath282 will never be produced in the cascades , because the colored particles decay via @xmath298 .",
    "if @xmath299 , then the branching fraction for producing @xmath293 is the product of three probabilities : first , the probability of the gluino / squark decaying into a neutralino or chargino heavier than @xmath282 ; second , the probability of that gaugino decaying into @xmath300 rather than into a lighter gaugino or @xmath301 ; and third , the probability that @xmath282 decays into @xmath293 rather than @xmath302 . ) and br(@xmath303 ) are suppressed if @xmath283 is essentially right - handed . ]",
    "none of these probabilities is likely to be smaller than @xmath304few if @xmath299 , so in this case the rate for higgs production from @xmath282 decay at the lhc could easily be comparable to or even much larger than that due to @xmath305 . moreover , the cascade products ( additional jets , and an energetic lepton from @xmath306 decay , for instance ) , allow for detection via th @xmath307 mode , so that the signal is further enhanced relative to @xmath308 by a factor of a thousand .",

    "the second probability is also @xmath313 , because @xmath316 and @xmath296 are equally likely to produce @xmath317 and @xmath282 and do not couple to @xmath295 in the limit that it is pure bino .",
    "the third probability is determined by @xmath318 , and can be as large as @xmath319 .",
    "so in this case , the branching fraction for producing @xmath293 could be @xmath320 , leading to higgs production rate of about ten times larger than that from gluon fusion ( not just five times larger , since each strong production event gives two sparticles that can potentially produce a higgs ) .",
    "in fact , in this case the rate of higgs _ pair _ production through @xmath282 decay is as large as the rate for @xmath312 .",

    "note that even if @xmath324 gev , the rate for cascade higgs production is only down from the @xmath312 rate by a factor of @xmath325 , and would still likely allow for discovery because the signal is not suppressed by the @xmath326 branching ratio .",

    "one choice for the higher order entries in @xmath373 that is compatible with the small angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem is @xmath399 leading to eigenvalues for @xmath384 @xmath400 , @xmath386 , and @xmath387 , and mixing angles @xmath388 , @xmath401 , and @xmath402 . choosing @xmath403 leads to acceptable masses and mixings . since the 12 and 13 entries of @xmath384",
    "are order @xmath386 , @xmath404 is suppressed by roughly a factor of @xmath405 relative to the large angle msw case .",
    "if large universal contributions to @xmath366 are present , they will suppress the effects of the flavor violating contributions induced by @xmath373 at tree level .",
    "however , even if we ignore ( [ eq : lfvmsq ] ) entirely and take a universal form for @xmath366 at , say , the gut scale , we still obtain potentially interesting flavor violating signals .",
    "this is because the @xmath35 terms generate non universal contributions to @xmath366 radiatively : @xmath406 this effect has been studied in @xcite in the context of see - saw theories with a high scale for the right - handed neutrinos . in these models ,",
    "the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings are sizable and generate additional non - universal contributions , leading to @xmath407 for a universal scalar mass @xmath408 and a right handed neutrino scale @xmath409 .",
    "notice that while in our framework only the @xmath35 term contributions are present and not those from the yukawa couplings , the logarithm is larger than in the see - saw case because the right handed neutrinos remain in the effective theory down to low energies .    to calculate rates for flavor changing processes due to ( [ eq : nonu ] ) for a given set of mssm parameters",
    ", one needs to know the @xmath35 matrix .",
    "this ambiguity is at the same level as in @xcite , where the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings are unknown : the size of the largest coupling is fixed by atmospheric neutrino data only once the scale of the right handed neutrinos is specified ( the @xmath35 terms are chosen proportional to the yukawas , with the scale set by the universal gaugino mass ) . setting @xmath410 gev ,",
    "the authors of @xcite considered textures for @xmath6 based on abelian symmetries and found promising signals for @xmath411 and @xmath380 for significant portions of parameter space .",
    "if we take @xmath412 in ( [ eq : nonu ] ) , then our framework yields very similar signals to @xcite for a given choice of susy parameters and a given form for @xmath6 .",
    "the relationship @xmath413 , where @xmath11 is of the order of weak scale and @xmath10 an ultraviolet cutoff , has been tremendously successful in describing the small mass of the neutrino . whether arising from planck - scale suppressed operators in an effective theory , or from a particular realization such as the see - saw mechanism , this has been generally interpreted to signify the presence of lepton - number violating physics at the scale @xmath10 , well above the reach of laboratory high - energy physics .",
    "this belief is predicated upon the idea that the coupling of the neutrino to the lepton - number violating sector of physics is order one , as might be expected in a gut see - saw , for instance .",
    "the likelihood of a light dirac neutrino has been discounted for decades . given the observed mass scales for neutrinos from solar and atmospheric neutrino data",
    ", we would need a yukawa coupling at @xmath414 or smaller which appears difficult to understand when the smallest known yukawa , @xmath375 , is @xmath415 .",
    "there is a possibility to explain the needed small yukawa coupling as a consequence of a new flavor symmetry @xmath8 broken only very slightly . in previous efforts , the factorization of the symmetry group into @xmath416 has been extended to the factorization of the symmetry breaking itself : vevs which break @xmath8 are supersymmetry preserving , while vevs breaking susy ( @xmath417 ) are @xmath8 conserving . if this is not the case , however , the yukawa coupling can have an additional suppression factors in powers of @xmath418 .",
    "the lightness of the higgs doublets in supersymmetric theories ( @xmath419 ) suggests that such a factorization of symmetry breaking is inadequate .",
    "there should exist an additional symmetry group @xmath27 which is broken in the supersymmetry breaking sector .",
    "given that the higgs is kept light by @xmath27 , we may ask whether there might be other particles such as right - handed neutrinos , singlet under the standard model , also kept light by @xmath27 .",
    "conventional & sdirac ( @xmath420 ) & see - saw & & & & eft & @xmath387 & @xmath177 & & & & & @xmath23 & & @xmath177 & & & & @xmath421 & @xmath422 & & @xmath177 & & & @xmath423 & & & @xmath422 & @xmath177 & & @xmath424 & @xmath425 & @xmath426 & @xmath425 & @xmath426 & @xmath425 & @xmath422    one immediate consequence is that the physics responsible for the relationship @xmath427 is not occuring at the scale @xmath10 , and , in particular , that the mass of the standard model singlet state may be much lighter than @xmath10  even as light as @xmath428 itself .",
    "the numerous new possibilities , employing only vevs in integer powers of @xmath429 , are summarized in table [ tb : scenarios ] .",
    "in particular , there are interesting possibilities of sdirac ( a light dirac neutrino ) and smajorana ( a light majorana neutrino with a weak - scale right - handed neutrino ) scenarios in a single generation .",
    "the idea that @xmath27 , which protects @xmath177 , is broken in the supersymmetry breaking sector is by no means purely philosophical . in theories in which @xmath27 is broken by a supersymmetry preserving vev",
    ", we typically expect _ all _ couplings of @xmath13 supermultiplet to be highly suppressed . on the other hand",
    ", the case @xmath27 is broken in the supersymmetry breaking sector immediately invites the possibility of unsuppressed @xmath35 terms for right - handed scalar neutrinos , which radically alter the phenomenology of this scenario relative to previous ones .",
    "for instance , higgs physics can be modified drastically , both in production and decay .",
    "the mass spectrum of sleptons is dramatically altered and the presence of a light @xmath430 sneutrino is permitted .",
    "collider signatures can be changed dramatically . with or without lepton",
    "number violation , the sneutrino is revived as a dark matter candidate .",
    "all of these things are easily realized if @xmath27 is broken by supersymmetry breaking vevs .",
    "furthermore , if the supersymmetry breaking sector breaks flavor symmetries that are also broken in a separate supersymmetry conserving sector , we have a potentially new understanding of the large mixing in the neutrino sector .",
    "since the vevs of the fields @xmath30 which break supersymmetry need not be aligned with flavor violating vevs that preserve supersymmetry , there is no reason to expect the mass eigenstates of neutrinos to be aligned with those of charged fermions , although they may still have a hierarchical structure .",
    "when viewed from the perspective of the @xmath0 problem , such a scenario is exceedingly natural .",
    "the presence of unsuppressed @xmath35 terms provide not only exciting phenomenology , but also the promise that this scenario can be tested in the near future .",
    "while experiments will provide the ultimate test of these ideas , this framework provides exciting possibilities for connections between what previously have seemed separate elements of supersymmetric theories .",
