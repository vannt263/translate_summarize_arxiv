    "in the literature , many studies have been devoted to understanding the mechanism of aeolian ripple formation @xcite . in particular , a hydrodynamic(al ) model , based on a continuum dynamical description with two species of grains ( immobile and rolling grains ) ,",
    "was proposed with success by bouchaud et al . @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient of such a model is a bilinear differential equation , for the population of the two species of grains , which shows the instability of a flat bed against ripple formation . in this paper",
    "we show that the same reasoning which has been used to describe the sand ripples formation in deserts can be conveniently applied to the studies of dynamical surface roughening @xcite leading to an accurate description of the morphogenesis and evolution of ripples on crystal and amorphous surfaces during ion sputtering . to this end",
    "we substantially extended the original approach by introducing new terms describing the particle - mobility on the surface . in ion - sputtered surface growth ,",
    "these new terms play a central role as control parameters in the dynamics of ripple formation .",
    "the present approach contains the bradley - harper approach @xcite ( based on a kardar - parisi - zhang type equation @xcite ) and it represents an alternative , independent and original way to study the problem of surface instabilities .     two examples of ripple formation in two completely distinct physical systems : ripples on sand ( gobi desert ) and ripples on surfaces ( ag under ion sputtering ) .",
    "the line below the two figures corresponds approximately respectively to 1 _ m _ and 50 _ nm _",
    ", width=453 ]",
    "when the surface of a solid is taken under ion sputtering some atoms in the proximity of the surface receive energy from the sputtered ions and pass from a bounded - _ ` immobile ' _ - solid state to a _",
    "` mobile ' _ unbounded state .",
    "the opposite mechanism is also allowed : some _ mobile _ atoms can gain in energy by becoming _",
    "immobile _ and bounding in a given position in the solid .",
    "a certain fraction of atoms might also be dispersed into the atmosphere .",
    "let us call @xmath0 the height of surface profile made of immobile -bounded- atoms and call @xmath1 the height of mobile -melted- atoms . in analogy with the theory developed to explain the dynamical evolutions of dunes in deserts @xcite , we describe the mechanisms of excavation , exchange between mobile and immobile atoms and surface displacement of mobile atoms in term of the following differential equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the rate of atoms that are excavated under the action of the sputtering , and @xmath4 is the part of them that pass from immobile to mobile , whereas @xmath5 is the fraction that is dispersed into the atmosphere .",
    "let us now write in details the various terms contained in eq.[e1 ] .",
    "first we consider the the excavation effect which must depend on the number and velocity of the sputtered ions ( i.e. its flux ) , but also the local shape and orientation of the surface might play an important role . indeed , the energy transmitted by the impacting ions concentrate more in regions of the surface with positive curvature .",
    "moreover , part of the surface facing the flux are likely to experience a different erosion respect to others which are less exposed to the flux .",
    "crystalline orientation and anisotropies might be also taken into account .",
    "we can write : @xmath6 here",
    "@xmath7 is the sputtering flux , whereas @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively associated with the flux - direction - dependent and with the curvature - dependent sputtering erosion .",
    "we now consider the adsorption process .",
    "first we note that the rate of adsorption of mobile atoms into immobile solid positions must be dependent on the quantity of mobile atoms in a given spatial position . similarly to the excavation process , the adsorption is also dependent on the local curvature and orientation .",
    "we can write : @xmath10 where the parameter @xmath11 is the recombination rate and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are associated to the different probabilities of recombination in relation with the local orientation and shape of the surface .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "[ gex ] , [ gad ] contain the same terms as the ones proposed in the literature for the formation of aeolian dunes in the so - called hydrodynamical model @xcite .",
    "indeed , in deserts , sand grains are lifted from the sand - bed and readsorbed into it with a probability which is dependent on the local shape and orientation of the dunes .",
    "[ gex ] , [ gad ] _ represent the simplest analytical expressions which formally take into account these shape and orientation dependences_. in the search for simple explanations , such equations are therefore rather universal .    in this paper",
    "we do not intend to enter into the details of the physics of surface erosion and adsorption .",
    "further discussion on can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "mobile atoms will move on the surface , and the quantity @xmath14 in eq.[e1 ] is the ` current ' of these atoms . in surface growth , there are two main mechanisms that are commonly indicated as the responsible for the surface mobility of atoms @xcite .",
    "the first is a current , driven by the variations of the local chemical potential , which tends to smoothen the surface asperity moving atoms from hills to valleys .",
    "the second is the current induced by the erlich - schwoebel barrier which -on the contrary- moves atoms uphill . in addiction to these main mechanisms we might also have to take into account a drift velocity and a random thermal diffusion , obtaining : @xmath15 in this equation , the first term describes a deterministic diffusion driven by the variations of the chemical potential which depends on the local shape of the surface ; the second term is associated with the uphill current due to the erlich - schwoebel barrier and @xmath16 is a constant associated with the characteristic length .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 is a drift velocity of the mobile atoms on the surface , whereas @xmath18 is the dispersion constant associated with the random thermal motion .",
    "note that eq.[j1 ] _ is substantially different from the one proposed in the literature to describe ripples in granular media _ @xcite . here",
    "the current is supposed to be dependent on the local shape and orientation of the surface ( the @xmath19 profile ) .",
    "the equations describing sand deserts can be retrieved from eq.[j1 ] by imposing @xmath20 and @xmath21 , but -on the contrary- in surface growth these two parameters are the leading terms of the equation and play the role of control parameters in the dynamics of ripple formation .",
    "nonetheless , these terms describe a rather simple dependence of the dynamic of particles on a surface on the geometrical shape of the surface itself . again",
    ", in our seek for universality , we expect that similar terms can be profitably introduced in the context of aeolian sand ripples in order to describe specific phenomena ( associated , for instance , with packing properties @xcite or granular flow @xcite ) which relate the current of grains with the dune - shapes .",
    "it should be noted that the factors @xmath8 , @xmath12 and @xmath22 in eqs.[gex],[gad ] and [ j1 ] are _ vectors _",
    "( i.e. they have -in general- different components in the two horizontal directions ) . indeed , crystal surfaces are in general anisotropic and therefore one must take into account the dependence of the parameters on the relative orientation of the crystal - surface and the sputtering direction . however in this paper we focus on the 1-dimensional case only .",
    "preliminary results show that this approach can be indeed straightforwardly extended to the two - dimensional case",
    ".     numerical solutions of eq.[e1 ] at various times indicate that under the action of ion sputtering the surface develops an instability which leads to the formation of ripples with a well defined characteristic wavelength . in the figure",
    "the black - thick line is the final surface - profile , whereas the thinner - gray ( -green , online version only ) lines are some profiles at previous times .",
    "( see appendix [ a.sim ] for details).,width=453 ]",
    "a trivial solution of eq.[e1 ] can be written for a completely flat surface : @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in this case , we obtain @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this describes a surface that rests flat and it is eroded with a speed equal to @xmath27 . but this behavior is only hypothetical since -in general- the dynamics of the surface - profile presents instabilities against spontaneous roughening and therefore its evolution is more complex .",
    "for instance , a numerical solution of eq.[e1 ] , is shown in fig.[f.1 ] ( for the 1-dimensional case ) .",
    "we observe that , in a certain range of the parameters , the surface is unstable and periodic ripples are formed spontaneously .    in order to infer indications about the amplification or the smoothing of small perturbations and to deduce an analytical expression for the ripples wave - length at their beginning ,",
    "we perform a stability analysis on eq.[e1 ] . for this purpose",
    "we assume that the surface - profile is made by the combination of a flat term plus a rough part : @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we substitute these quantities into eq.[e1 ] and linearize the equation by taking only the first order in @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "the imaginary part of the dispersion relation @xmath37 can assume negative values which are associated with the surface instability ( arbitrary units ) @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of modes with wavelengths @xmath38 will grow exponentially fast .",

    "the imaginary part of @xmath36 is non - negative , therefore we -correctly- expect no spontaneous corrugation of the surface . on the contrary ,",
    "when the sputtering is active ( @xmath63 ) , the imaginary part of @xmath36 can assume negative values as shown in fig.[f.2 ] where a plot of @xmath64 is reported .",
    "as one can see , typically the branch @xmath64 takes negative values for @xmath39 between 0 and a critical value @xmath65 at which it passes the zero @xcite .",
