    "one of the fundamental issues in social science is to understand how new strategies , technologies , and ideologies spread and diffuse through population  @xcite . one possible mechanism that may explain this phenomenon is _ bilingualism _ , where people can adopt two traits  such as languages , technologies , and ideas  in parallel .",
    "many of the related researches are performed also in physics as well as economics and mathematical sociology  @xcite .    in the recently studied bilingualism models by kleinberg et al . , a population with two early adopters has been considered and how the compatibility of bilingualism influences the cascading behavior has been examined  @xcite . motivated by these studies , we investigate the population with single zealot since we realized even one zealot can trigger off the cascades .",
    "in particular , we focus on how the interaction range influences the cascading behavior , and explore the system by systematically changing the range from local to global .",
    "moreover , in order to see how the compatibility affect competition in the real world , we also apply the model to the real social networks , and investigate its cascading behavior .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : a costly bilingualism model is introduced in sec .",
    "[ model ] , then we reports the analytic and numerical results on one dimensional ring with an increasing interaction range in sec .",
    "[ results1 ] and those of the globally coupled case in sec .",
    "[ results2 ] . in sec",
    ".  [ application ] , an application to social networks are displayed .",
    "finally we summarize and discuss our results in sec .  [ summary ] .",
    ".payoff matrix of the costly bilingualism model . here",
    "max@xmath0 represents the larger of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and @xmath3 in the last row denotes the cost of bilingualism .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     on the other hand , the case of the network with strong community structures can be a different story .",
    "we investigate several target nodes in other social networks : les miserables network  @xcite ( @xmath4 ) , dolphin network  @xcite ( @xmath5 ) , and coauthorship network of network scientists  @xcite ( @xmath6 , only considering the giant connected component ) , based on high @xmath7 , small cc , and small @xmath8 .",
    "we find that small cc , small @xmath8 , and even high @xmath7 do not promise large cascade size since cascades often stop after converting several nodes in a community even when they start from the hubs .",
    "therefore , the size of assigned community or the centrality can be also important factors for the cascades when the network has high modularity , which requires an in - depth study on the role of the modularity on the cascading in complex networks .",
    "to summarize , we considered costly bilingualism model in a population with one zealot , and explored how the compatibility influences on the cascading behavior of one strategy , extending the interaction range from local to global .",
    "we found that superior strategy does not necessarily propagate . in the parameter region where this phenomenon occurs",
    ", the _ reentrant _ phase transition occurs .",
    "we found that it is caused by the local interaction with one s neighbors rather than the long - range one .",
    "we applied the model to real - world social network and showed how the network properties take effects in the cascades .",
    "we have learned the lessons that if the zealot locates at the node with high degree , this is good for the larger cascade .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the small clustering coefficient and small average neighbors degree enhance the cascade .",
    "finally , we demonstrated that the community structure makes it hard to predict the cascade size .",
    "if a network has high modularity , the community structure should be considered carefully , which is remained for future study .",
