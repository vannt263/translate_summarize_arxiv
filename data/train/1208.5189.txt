    "quantum descriptions of physical systems begin with the introduction of a vector space , generally defined over the complex number field @xmath2 , with elements of the space associated with states of the physical system under consideration .",
    "this space , in the traditional approach , is assumed to be a hilbert space @xmath3 , which for @xmath4-level systems is @xmath5 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath3 possesses a natural inner product @xmath6 , which we denote @xmath7 it is customary to associate a dual - vector @xmath8 to each vector @xmath9 , with the same label @xmath10 , via @xmath11 so that @xmath12 the presence of the inner product allows the definition of hermitian conjugation of linear operators via @xmath13 and that of hermitian operators , to which physical observables are associated , via @xmath14 .",
    "it also allows for the definition of unitary operators via @xmath15 under which the states are assumed to evolve .",
    "there are two ways for the quantum description to make contact with physical reality . in the first approach , possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable @xmath16 are assumed to be given by its eigenvalues .",
    "let us denote the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue @xmath10 by @xmath17 : @xmath18 when the system is in the state represented by @xmath19 , the probability of obtaining the outcome @xmath20 as a result of a measurement of @xmath16 is given by @xmath21 where the sum in the denominator runs over all the eigenvalues of @xmath16 .",
    "the hermiticity of @xmath16 ensures that its eigenvalues are all real , and that the eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal and complete . normalizing the state vector and the eigenvectors of @xmath16 so that @xmath22 the above expression for the probability reduces to @xmath23 .",
    "there is an alternative way of making contact with reality , which is equivalent to the one above for conventional treatments .",
    "one begins with the quantity @xmath24 which is real for hermitan @xmath16 , and interprets the result as the expectation value for the associated observable in the state @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath26 , the expression reduces to @xmath27 . note that this is the standard approach in quantum field theory ( qft ) where all physical predictions are expressed in terms of @xmath4-point correlation functions , _",
    "i.e. _ , the vacuum expectation values of the products of @xmath4 field operators .",
    "this is most explicit in the path integral formulation of qft . to recover the probabilistic interpretation of the first approach",
    ", one asserts that the probability for obtaining the outcome @xmath10 for the measurement of @xmath16 on the state @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 no absolute values are invoked , and attention is shifted to moments of the relevant observable operator in the state in question ; in particular we do need the expectation values of powers of the operator .",
    "for canonical quantum descriptions using the hilbert space @xmath3 , these two starting points lead to identical results .",
    "the situation however changes when the underlying space is not a hilbert space .",
    "indeed , for spaces for which the inner product is ill - defined , one can expect different outcomes for these two approaches .    in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ( inspired by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , we have explored the possibility of discretizing the fields over which the vector space is defined but retaining the physical interpretation provided by the first approach , namely , the definition of probabilities via eq .",
    "( [ probdef ] ) .",
    "the fields we considered were finite galois fields @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is a prime number .",
    "for the @xmath33 case , they are @xmath34 .",
    "vector spaces over @xmath30 do not have inner products since @xmath30 is not an ordered field , preventing any bilinear map to @xmath30 from being positive - definite ( or non - negative ) in a natural way .",
    "however , it was recognized that for eq .",
    "( [ probdef ] ) to make sense , the dual - vectors that appear in the expression only need to constitute a basis for the dual - vector space with a possible outcome of a measurement associated with each one .",
    "the usual pairing of dual - vectors with vectors via the inner product is inessential .",
    "indeed , all the inner product does , in a sense , is connect the two approaches via the property @xmath35 so that we can write , @xmath36 where we have made the identification @xmath37 thus , for the first approach , inner products are not necessary , and once a basis of the dual - vector space and the associated set of outcomes is specified , we have an ` observable . '    to make contact with the outcome of measurements and probability distributions , we need a map from the galois field to that of non - negative reals .",
    "it is essential that this map preserves products , which is necessary to distinguish entangled states from product ones , and also for the actions of symmetry groups on the galois field .",
    "this is achieved in @xcite and @xcite through an absolute value function .",
    "( [ probdef ] ) can be used as is to define the probability of each outcome via the absolute value function from @xmath30 to @xmath38 given by @xmath39 here , numbers and symbols with underlines are used to denote elements of @xmath30 , to distinguish them from elements of @xmath38 . note that this function is product preserving , i.e. @xmath40 , which is essential for probabilities of product states to factorize . applying this formalism to 2-level systems , we constructed spin - like observables for which the measurement outcomes were @xmath41 , and calculated the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) bound for the model and found that it was two , despite the fact that no hidden variable mimic could reproduce the model s predictions . for details , see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore consequences of starting with the second approach to interpretation , namely , the definition of expectation values via eq .",
    "( [ evdef ] ) .",
    "again , we consider vector spaces over the finite galois field @xmath30 , which do not have inner products .",
    "thus , the concepts of normalizability of states , hermiticity of operators , and a dual - vector as a hermitian conjugate of a vector , must all be reexamined before we can apply eq .",
    "( [ evdef ] ) . furthermore ,",
    "working in a vector space over @xmath30 , the expression @xmath42 will generically lead to an element of @xmath30 , which must be mapped to an element of @xmath38 if the result is to represent the expectation value of a measurement of a physical observable .",
    "while we obtain results similar to our earlier ones for certain fields , we discover significant differences in others .    in the following",
    ", we will address these points one by one and define a ` mutant ' qm on vector spaces over the fields @xmath43 and then @xmath44}$ ] , where @xmath45 is the solution to the equation @xmath46 , which is irreducible in @xmath0 . in both cases , we will find that @xmath47 by construction , which will be mapped to a number in @xmath38 .",
    "because we are looking at the expectation values of observables , the range of this map need not be restricted to the non - negative reals as in the case of the absolute value function . in appendix",
    "b we show that the requirement that this map preserve products and actions of symmetry groups determines the map uniquely .",
    "it is the use of this map for specific expectation values , instead of the absolute value function on brackets , that distinguishes between the two approaches to interpretation",
    ". we will show below that the connection to probabilities given by eq .",
    "( [ pdelta ] ) for canonical qm is no longer valid .",
    "in fact , individual probability distributions are not fixed in our approach , giving rise to indeterminacies beyond those of canonical qm . our earlier result in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite that the chsh bound for spin - like systems over galois fields can not be larger than 2 was predicated upon using the first approach starting with eq .",
    "( [ probdef ] ) .",
    "we will find that in the second approach , the chsh bound for the @xmath0 case is also 2 . for the @xmath1 case",
    ", however , the chsh bound is 4 , the maximum possible value .",
    "as far as we are aware of , this is one of the first explicit examples of a non - trivial super - quantum theory .    before we proceed to the heart of the matter",
    ", we note that consideration of discrete mathematical structures is not only relevant from an academic point of view .",
    "we note that such considerations have been seriously undertaken in various approaches to the quantum structure of space and time , i.e. in various forms of quantum gravity .",
    "the more complete literature can be found in @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii we introduce what we call biorthogonal quantum mechanics , and in section iii we present a few examples of this construction . then in section iv we consider the chch bound and find an explicit example of a super - quantum theory . in section v we show that in such a theory probabilities are indeterminate .",
    "we close in section vi with detailed comments about the physical relevance of our results .",
    "various details not covered in the main text are presented in two appendices .",
    "in order to adopt the definition of expectation values via eq .",
    "( [ evdef ] ) onto a vector space over the galois field @xmath30 , one must define the analogue of hermitian conjugation of vectors and linear operators without reference to an inner product . in this section , we demonstrate that this can be accomplished via _ biorthogonal systems _",
    "@xcite .",
    "in the following , we restrict our attention to the galois fields @xmath30 with @xmath48 and @xmath33 or @xmath49 .",
    "as we will see below , this restriction allows our formalism to maintain a close parallel to quantum mechanics defined on vector spaces over @xmath38 ( @xmath33 case ) or @xmath2 ( @xmath50 case ) .      as in the previous section ,",
    "elements of the finite galois field @xmath30 are denoted by underlined symbols and numbers to distinguish them from elements of @xmath38 or @xmath2 . the @xmath4-dimensional vector space over @xmath30",
    "is denoted @xmath51 .",
    "a biorthogonal system is a set consisting of a basis @xmath52 of the vector space @xmath51 , and a basis @xmath53 of the dual vector space @xmath54 such that @xmath55 where @xmath56 such a system can be constructed as follows .",

    "is reducible for @xmath66 or @xmath67 since in those cases @xmath68 will be a solution .",

    "adjoining @xmath70 to @xmath65 gives us @xmath71}$ ] .",
    "elements of this field can be expressed as @xmath72 , where @xmath73",
    ". then @xmath74 furthermore , @xmath75 in particular , @xmath76 therefore , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are ` complex conjugates ' of each other , while @xmath79 is ` real . '",
    "thus , when @xmath48 , the fields @xmath65 and @xmath71}$ ] take on the roles of @xmath38 and @xmath2 .    in the following ,",
    "when we say @xmath30 , we will mean either @xmath80 or @xmath81 with @xmath48 unless stated otherwise .",
    "also , borrowing from standard terminology , we will say that two vectors in @xmath51 are ` orthogonal ' to each other when they have a zero dot product , and that a vector is ` self - orthogonal ' when it is orthogonal to itself .      next , choose a basis @xmath52 for @xmath51 such that : @xmath82 that is , all the basis vectors are orthogonal to each other , but none are self - orthogonal .",
    "let us call such a basis an ` ortho - nondegenerate ' basis .",
    "the simplest example of an ortho - nondegenerate basis would be such that the @xmath83-th element of the @xmath84-th vector is given by @xmath85 , proving that such a basis always exists .",
    "on the other hand , not all bases satisfy this condition since @xmath51 typically has multiple self - orthogonal vectors other than the zero vector .",
    "define the ` conjugate ' dual vector for each vector @xmath86 in the ortho - nondegenerate basis as @xmath87 where it is crucial that @xmath88 for @xmath89 to exist .",
    "then , the set of dual vectors @xmath53 provides a basis for the dual vector space @xmath54 such that @xmath90 .",
    "thus , we obtain the set @xmath91 which constitutes a biorthogonal system .",
    "given a biorthogonal system , we can define the analog of hermitian operators via @xmath92 due to the biorthogonality of the system , @xmath93 is the eigenvector of @xmath16 with eigenvalue @xmath94 . note that the eigenvalues @xmath94 are chosen to be elements of @xmath80 , not @xmath81 , i.e. they are ` real . '    in the defining biorthogonal system , the matrix representation of @xmath16 is diagonal . in a different biorthogonal system ,",
    "say @xmath95 , its matrix representation is @xmath96 which in general is not a hermitian matrix . however , the diagonal elements @xmath97 are nevertheless ` real ' since @xmath98 and @xmath99 are ` complex conjugates ' of each other , while @xmath100 and @xmath101 are ` real . '",
    "we identify these pseudo - hermitian operators with physical observables .      since we wish to use eq .",
    "( [ evdef ] ) to define the expectation value for the observable @xmath16 , every physical state @xmath25 must have a conjugate dual @xmath102 , which we define via eq .",
    "( [ vconjugation ] ) .",
    "thus , we demand that all physical states belong to some biorthogonal system . essentially",
    ", all vectors that are not self - orthogonal belong to some biorthogonal system , so this requirement is equivalent to dropping all vectors that are self - orthogonal from the set of physical states .    note that if we multiply @xmath25 with a scalar , that is , a non - zero element of @xmath30 , then its conjugate @xmath102 will be multiplied by the inverse of that scalar .",
    "this will leave @xmath16 and @xmath27 invariant .",
    "thus , we can identify all vectors that differ with each other by a multiplicative scalar as representing the same physical state , that is , all non - zero elements of @xmath30 can be considered to be ` phases .

    "we would like to interpret this quantity as the expectation value of the observable @xmath16 .",
    "however , if @xmath16 is to represent a physical quantity such as spin , one must map the resulting number in @xmath80 to a number in @xmath38 .",
    "we demand that this map from @xmath80 to @xmath38 be product preserving for reasons that will become clear in the following .",
    "it is easy to see that the absolute value function given in eq .",
    "( [ absdef ] ) is a product preserving map for any @xmath32 . for the @xmath48 case",
    ", however , in addition to the absolute value function , there is another product preserving map which can be constructed as follows .",
    "first , denote the generator of the multiplicative group @xmath105 by @xmath106 and express the non - zero elements of @xmath80 as @xmath107 .",
    "define : @xmath108 it is straightforward to show that @xmath109 .",
    "note that @xmath48 implies @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the additive inverse of @xmath114 in @xmath80 .",
    "that is , this function respectively maps @xmath113 , @xmath115 , and @xmath114 in @xmath80 to @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 in @xmath38 .",
    "we will use this map to give meaning to eq .",
    "( [ evdef ] ) as an expectation value in the new version of quantum mechanics : @xmath119 using this identification as a starting point in modifying ordinary quantum mechanics is a viable alternative to specifying a prescription for calculating individual probabilities for outcomes of measurements , as we mentioned earlier .",
    "the uniqueness of this map is demonstrated in appendix b. the rule allows us to calculate single and joint probability distributions over ensembles .",
    "an immediate consequence of this rule is noteworthy .",
    "the uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath16 will be given by @xmath120 ^ 2 \\cr & = &   { { \\varphi}\\left({\\langle \\psi |}\\hat{a}^2{| \\psi \\rangle}\\right ) } -\\left[{{\\varphi}\\left({\\langle \\psi |}\\hat{a}{|",

    "thus , if a measurement of an observable is performed on one of its eigenstates , the outcome will always be the @xmath123-map of the eigenvalue associated with that state .",
    "if @xmath123 were not product preserving , this property would not have been maintained .",
    "let us now look at a few concrete examples .      consider the 2d vector space @xmath125 over @xmath126 , where we denote the additive inverse of @xmath114 as @xmath113 instead of @xmath127 .",

    ".expectation values and uncertainties of spin - like observables in biorthogonal quantum mechanics on @xmath125 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,>,^,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     what are the corresponding probabilities ?",
    "let us take the spins in the @xmath134-direction , @xmath135 , as an example .",
    "the probabilities of the outcomes @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 in canonical qm are listed in table  [ qmprobs ] . as can be seen , they reproduce the correlations listed above as they should .    in our ` mutant ' biorthogonal quantum mechanics , however , the probabilities of individual outcomes are ill defined as discussed above .",
    "taking the point of view that the probabilities must be inferred from the expectation values , we have the constraints @xmath140 for @xmath141 , and @xmath142 for @xmath143 .",
    "these constraints imply @xmath144 but beyond this the probabilities can not be specified . therefore ,",
    "though our formalism predicts definite expectation values , it leaves probabilities indeterminate .",
    "physically , we interpret this to mean that if the same measurement is repeated many times , the average of the outcomes will converge to the predicted expectation value , while the frequencies of each outcome will continue to fluctuate .",
    "this indeterminacy is characteristic of the approach used here , and can be understood more generally by re - examining the defining relation between expectation values and probability distributions . in conventional qm , it is possible to construct the probability distribution for the measurement outcomes of some observable through use of the system of equations formed by the expectation values of the powers of the observable in question .",
    "this is not possible for spin observables in the model under consideration due to the cyclic nature of the underlying field .",
    "explicitly , the system of equations : @xmath145 will be singular if @xmath4 is greater than the least common multiple of the multiplicative orders of the eigenvalues @xmath10 of @xmath16 since the cyclic nature of the field is necessarily shared by the eigenvalues when the product preserving map also preserves the eigenvalues . in our examples , using @xmath0 as the ` real ' field , the eigenvalues of spin observables , @xmath146 , have multiplicative orders no greater than 2 .",
    "thus , when we form a four level system by entangling two particles , we find that the system of equations needed to solve for the probabilities of these four measurement outcomes is singular and can not be used to assign consistent probabilities .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we conjectured that a ` doubly ' quantized theory may predict super - quantum correlations with a chsh bound which exceeds the cirelson value of @xmath147 .",
    "a state in such a theory can be thought of as a ` superposition ' of various ` singly ' quantized states , each of which predicts definite probabilities .",
    "a ` measurement ' in a ` doubly ' quantized theory can be expected to collapse the ` doubly ' quantized state to a ` singly ' quantized one , selecting a particular probability distribution from all possible ones .",
    "every ` measurement ' will lead to a different probability distribution , so no definite probability will be predicted .",
    "these considerations suggest that biorthogonal qm is a candidate model for such a ` doubly ' quantized theory .",
    "one of the simplest realization of how quantum theory differs from its classical counterpart is given by the celebrated bell inequalities , or its slightly generalized version , the chsh inequalities @xcite . according to these inequalities the classical and quantum physics",
    "are clearly separated by @xmath148 effects .",
    "it has been pointed out in the literature that the purely statistical reasoning leads to the maximal `` super - quantum bound '' of 4 @xcite . in one of our previous papers",
    "we have pointed out the special nature of such a super - quantum theory @xcite . given the fact that the chsh inequalities rely on the knowledge of expectation values ( and not probabilities ) in this paper we have focused on the requirement that expectation values of a super - quantum theory should satisfy the bound of 4 .",
    "note that our present work is distinguished from other efforts that try to eliminate theories which violate the quantum bound or which claim the uniqueness of the canonical complex quantum theory because of the supposed unphysical nature of super - quantum theories ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as is well known , the expectation values and the probabilities are related by a quadratic map in canonical quantum theories and its real counterparts @xcite . that this map is quadratic",
    "can be argued on general grounds , and the robustness of the born rule @xcite , by pointing out the generic nature of the fisher metric on the space of measured events @xcite .",
    "the chsh observable relies only on the computation of the expectation values . in order to achieve",
    "the super - quantum bound of 4 , one immediately realizes ( at least on a heuristic level ) that the expectation values should be `` mutated '' so that the last term in the chsh observable changes its sign . given the canonical relation between the expectation values and the probabilities , such a `` mutation '' of the computation of the expectation values would , at least naively , influence the probabilities as well .",
    "this is precisely what we find in a concrete mathematical model explored in this paper : the chsh observable computed in the mutant quantum mechanics over the finite field @xmath1 is explicitly equal to 4 , which in turn implies that the probabilities are indeterminate in such a super - quantum theory .",
    "indeterminate probabilities are a consequence of our construction and , in this particular case , a necessary feature of such a super - quantum theory .",
    "note that this statement also goes against some efforts in the foundations of quantum theory , which try to base the canonical complex quantum theory solely on the concept of probability ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "our point is that even though canonical quantum theory might be solely based on the concept of probability , super - quantum theory does not have to be .",
    "this reinforces the experience of modern qft ( especially the conformal qft s ) in which one operates only with correlation functions .    in appendix",
    "a , we show that , in the context of galois biorthogonal qm , the projective orthogonal and the projective unitary groups play the natural role of the orthogonal and unitary groups of canonical qm .",
    "this maintains a parallel with our previous papers on galois field qm @xcite where we have shown that the complex ( and real ) projective spaces , which define the geometry of canonical quantum theory , can be naturally replaced by their finite projective counterparts .",
    "similarly , in this work , the orthogonal and unitary groups that define the invariance of expectation values in the real and complex quantum theories are replaced by their projective counterparts .",
    "it is of course tempting to contemplate that the general structure of biorthogonal systems , the graded valuation of expectation values , and the indeterminate nature of probabilities is valid for more general constructions of super - quantum theories , including the ones that we expect to be relevant in quantum theory of gravity .    to summarize : in this paper we have presented perhaps the simplest model for quantum super - correlations .",
    "quantum super - correlations are realized in the model together with a signature feature : the physics of the model is entirely determined in terms of expectation values , whereas the probabilities are , in general , indeterminate .",
    "this feature is actually quite natural ( and desirable ) from various point of view suggested by different modern avenues of fundamental physics .",
    "we note that the fact that the probabilities are indeterminate in our explicit construction also meshes well with some expectations from various attempts at quantum theory of gravity ( including the ones in which conformal field theories are used to define a quantum theory of gravity in particular asymptotic geometries . ) indeed , that fundamental quantum theories can be defined in terms of expectation values ( which is most obvious in the path integral formulation ) , is a feature found in modern conformal field theories , which are quantum field theory formulated from a purely algebraic viewpoint , without the use of lagrangians ( or hamiltonians ) or feynman rules .",
    "for example , the familiar s - matrix of the canonical quantum field theory , which comes about from compounding expectation values ( correlation functions ) with wave - functions of external probes , is not a well - defined concept in conformal field theory .",
    "as is well known , conformal field theories , can be dual to ( quantum ) gravitational theories in certain background ( the ads spaces @xcite , and also in the context of the observed cosmological de sitter spacetimes @xcite ) .",
    "thus , this feature should be relevant in the context of quantum gravity as well .",
    "indeed , different approaches to non - perturbative quantum gravity and quantum cosmology @xcite , suggest that the individual probability for specific measurements could be indeterminate , and that the observables in that context are different from the usual observables found in the canonical quantum theory . the model considered here",
    "should be viewed as a concrete realization of this general expectation .",
    "the model sheds new light on the foundations of quantum theory , and attempts to understand the simplest set of reasonable axioms that lead to canonical quantum theory , which could lead to natural generalizations of quantum theory expected in the context of quantum theory of gravity @xcite .    finally , we note that this work presents an alternative pathway to constructing a quantum theory on a vector space without an inner product from the one introduced in refs .",
    "application of the two constructions to banach spaces @xcite would be a natural place to further clarify the difference between the two approaches , do away with the product preserving map from @xmath80 to @xmath38 , and search for models which may serve as closer representations of reality where various quantum gravitational ideas discussed above can be explored .",
