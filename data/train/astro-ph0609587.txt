    "red galaxies dominate the high - mass end of the mass function at @xmath15 ( van dokkum et  al .",
    "2006 ) and are highly clustered ( daddi et al .  2003 ; grazian et al .  2006 ; quadri et al .",
    "most of these objects are too faint in the rest - frame ultra - violet to be selected as lyman break galaxies ( e.g. , frster schreiber et  al .",
    "2004 ; reddy et  al .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of these newly - found objects is that they are progenitors of today s massive early - type galaxies .",
    "interestingly , a large fraction of these galaxies appear to have very high star formation rates , based on modeling of their spectral energy distributions , ( stacked ) x - ray emission , infrared emission , submm emission , and spectra ( e.g. , frster schreiber et  al .",
    "2004 ; rubin et  al .",
    "2004 ; daddi et  al .",
    "2004 ; labb et  al . 2005 ; knudsen et  al . 2005 ; papovich et  al . 2006 ; webb et  al .",
    "a similar or smaller fraction is best - fit by passively evolving models with little ongoing star formation ( e.g. , labb et  al . 2005 ; papovich et  al .",
    "2006 ; kriek et  al .",
    "these results suggest that by @xmath16 we are entering the star formation epoch of massive early - type galaxies .",
    "an important question is whether the properties of early - type galaxies at intermediate redshift are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "furthermore , detailed studies of early - type galaxies in different environments may identify descendants of particular populations of massive galaxies at @xmath14 .",
    "for example , it may be that the passively evolving galaxies at @xmath16 are progenitors of cluster early - type galaxies whereas the star - forming galaxies are progenitors of early - type galaxies in groups .",
    "one of the most sensitive tools for determining the star formation epoch of early - type galaxies is the redshift evolution of the fundamental plane ( fp ) relation ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ) , as it reflects evolution in the @xmath1 ratios of galaxies and has very low scatter .",
    "the @xmath17 fp has been studied extensively in the past decade , both in clusters ( e.g. , van dokkum & franx 1996 ; van dokkum et  al .",
    "1998a ; wuyts et  al .",
    "2004 ; fritz et  al . 2005",
    "; holden et  al . 2005 ; jrgensen et  al .",
    "2006 ) and in the field ( e.g. , treu et  al . 1999 , 2002 , 2005a ; van dokkum et  al . 2001 ; rusin et al .  2003",
    "; van de ven et al .",
    "2003 ; van der wel et  al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ; di serego alighieri et  al .",
    "the results from these papers can be summarized as follows : 1 ) the @xmath1 ratios of the most massive cluster and field early - type galaxies evolve slowly and regularly , indicating early formation of their stars ; and 2 ) there is evidence that low mass galaxies evolve faster than high mass galaxies , both in the field and in clusters , suggesting that they have younger stellar populations .",
    "the interpretation of the first result is complicated by the small number of clusters that have been studied so far , uncertainties in the initial mass function ( imf ) , and by selection effects due to progenitor bias : if the morphologies of galaxies change with time the sample of high - redshift early - type galaxies is only a subset of the sample of nearby early - type galaxies , leading to biased age estimates ( see van dokkum & franx 2001 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the second result is complicated by the fact that large corrections for selection effects need to be made ( see treu et  al .",
    "2005a , 2005b ; van der wel et  al .",
    "2005 ) , and that galaxies are assumed to undergo no structural or dynamical changes with redshift .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to better constrain the star formation epoch of massive field and cluster galaxies , using the fp .",
    "we present spatially resolved spectroscopic data from keck and high - quality photometric data from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) for a sample of early - type galaxies in three clusters at @xmath0 .",
    "the fps of the three clusters are presented and discussed , and combined with literature data on the nearby coma cluster , a sample of nearby galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and eleven clusters at @xmath2 .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath1 ratio derived from this large sample is used to constrain the star formation epoch of massive cluster galaxies .",
    "we combine the cluster sample with recently published samples of field galaxies , and determine the age difference between massive field and cluster galaxies using a self - consistent modeling approach which is different from previous studies . in two companion papers",
    "( van der marel and van dokkum 2006a , b ; hereafter vdmvd06a , b ) we utilize our spatially - resolved data to construct detailed dynamical models for the sample galaxies .",
    "the results are compared to those for local samples , providing an independent method of deriving @xmath1 ratio evolution , and allowing us to validate the many assumptions that enter into analyses based on the fp .",
    "the dynamical models also yield a normalized measure of the rotation rate [ akin to @xmath18 of the sample galaxies , providing a method to identify s0 galaxies that have been visually misclassified as ellipticals , based on their kinematics .",
    "the structure of the present paper is as follows .",

    "the measured evolution of the @xmath3 ratio is interpreted in  6 . in this section",
    "the implications for the star formation epoch of massive cluster galaxies are discussed , and the cluster data are compared to previously published data for field early - type galaxies .",
