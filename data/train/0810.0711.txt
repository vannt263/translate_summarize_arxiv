    "the warm ionized plasma of elliptical galaxies is an important phase of the ism that traces evolutionary processes and galactic interactions .",
    "h@xmath0 emission from this ism phase has been observed in many ellipticals @xcite , and has sometimes been interpreted to be the result of `` cooling flows '' , in which the hot x - ray emitting plasma radiates , cools down , and sinks toward the galactic center @xcite .",
    "however since the mass in colder gas and newly formed stars in most galaxies is far less than simple cooling models predict @xcite , a heating source is required to limit the net cooling rate .",
    "heating by radio - loud agn has received much attention recently and may be an important process @xcite for limiting cooling flows and the continued stellar growth of massive galaxies .",
    "however another heating source which may be important , especially in radio - quiet galaxies , is gravitational interactions @xcite .",
    "correlations between h@xmath0 emission and merger tracers such as dust and tidal tails provide suggestive evidence for a connection between gravitational interactions and the warm ionized gas in some ellipiticals @xcite , but clear evidence for such connections have been limited . in this paper",
    "we present compelling new evidence for a gravitational interaction origin for the h@xmath0 emission around the nearby elliptical m86 .",
    "the giant elliptical m86 , near the core of the virgo cluster , is the most massive galaxy in a large group or sub - cluster now merging with the rest of the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "it is blueshifted by 1350 km / s with respect to m87 at the heart of the cluster , and thought to be falling into the virgo cluster from behind .",
    "we adopt a distance to m86 of 17.5 mpc @xcite , which is @xmath21 mpc further than the distance to m87 .",
    "m86 has an unusually complex ism .",
    "there is a bright `` plume '' of x - ray emission from hot gas , beginning 3@xmath1= 15 kpc projected north of the nucleus and extending at least 10@xmath1= 50 kpc projected to the nw @xcite .",
    "several authors have suggested that this is a tail of gas stripped from m86 as it falls into the virgo icm @xcite , although other x - ray properties are not consistent with a simple stripping picture @xcite .",
    "m86 also has unusual clouds of hi @xcite and far - infrared @xcite emission , whose origin has not been understood .",
    "based on x - ray and fir properties , @xcite and @xcite suggested galaxy collisions may be involved , but could not identify clear evidence for any collision .",
    "m86 is a very weak radio source @xcite thus the ism complexities are unlikely to be related to agn activity , but are instead likely due to interactions in a group and cluster environment .    in this paper",
    "we present a deep wide - field h@xmath0+[nii ] image around m86 which shows a highly complex and disturbed ism / icm , including striking new evidence for a collision between m86 and the nearby heavily disturbed spiral ngc  4438 .",
    "both galaxies have been the subject of numerous individual studies , but this is the first evidence that has clearly linked them together .",
    "we propose that most of the peculiarities of the ism in m86 and ngc 4438 are due to this high - velocity collision , and discuss the implications for understanding the role of gravitational interactions in the energetics and evolution of the ism in ellipticals .",
    "the m86 region was observed with the mosaic imager on the kpno 4 m mayall telescope , in order to search for warm gas which could reveal clues about interactions .",
    "exposures were taken using three filters : the harris r ( k1004 , @xmath3/@xmath4@xmath3 = 6514/1511 ) broad - band filter and two h@xmath0 narrow - band filters - rest frame ( k1009 , 6575/81 ) and redshifted ( k1010 , 6521/80 ) .",
    "we imaged the system with 3 different pointing centers , and with 2 different h@xmath0 filters , in order to have spatial coverage out to the nearby galaxies ngc 4438 , ngc 4388 , and m84 , and wavelength coverage corresponding to both low ( -1280 to 2380 km / s fwhm ) high ( 780 to 4430 km / s ) velocities .",
    "total exposure times per field / velocity were 2000 sec for the r - band , and 7000 - 8000 sec for h@xmath0 .",
    "images were processed and mosaiced together in a standard way , except for additional flat fielding corrections using masked image frames , and a pupil correction for the h@xmath0 images .",
    "the h@xmath0 image superposed on an sdss gri image @xcite is shown in figure 1 , the r - band image is shown in figure 2a , and the h@xmath0 image is shown in figures 2b and 2c .",
    "we obtained spectroscopy at 24 selected positions near m86 with the sparsepak integral field unit ( ifu ) on the wiyn telescope .",
    "sparsepak @xcite is a 90-fiber array which loosely covers an 80@xmath580@xmath6 field of view , with 5@xmath7 diameter fibers .",
    "the fibers feed the bench spectrograph with a 860 line / mm grating , providing a spectral resolution of 1.6= 80 km / s and coverage from 5923 - 6862  .",
    "each of the positions was observed for 1 - 2 hrs . while the emission lines are strong and clearly detected in regions close to the center of m86 , the lines are weak in some of the outer positions , and for these we co - add the spectra from several adjacent fibers to measure the emission lines .",
    "we detect both the h@xmath0 and the 6583 [ nii ] lines in these outer clouds , but cite the velocity of the h@xmath0 line , since it is usually stronger .",
    "representative velocities from the spectroscopy are indicated on figure 2c .",
    "full imaging and spectroscopy results will be presented in a later paper .",
    "the h@xmath0 morphology of m86 is very complex , as shown in figure 2b .",
    "there are filamentary features with a range of morphologies , but very few small compact hii region - like knots ( except near ngc  4438 ) , and no obvious fuv sources @xcite , therefore very little star formation .",
    "we identify four major regions where the morphological characteristics of the h@xmath0 features appear to be distinct . 1 . * the inner 1 - 2@xmath1 of m86 . *",
    "the strongest h@xmath0 emission originates in the central 1 - 2@xmath1 of m86 , where it forms an asymmetric complex extending 2@xmath1 to the s of the nucleus , but only  1 to the n. the unusual h@xmath0 morphology in this region was previously shown by @xcite .",
    "some of the central h@xmath0 emission is located in the same region as an unusual off - nuclear cloud of hi emission @xcite , which extends from the nucleus to 2@xmath1 s ( see figure 2b ) .",
    "the southern edge of the hi cloud is spatially coincident with semi - circular arc of h@xmath0 which defines the southern limit of the `` eastern '' h@xmath0 filaments ( described in 2 . )",
    "suggesting they are physically associated .",
    "this region shows a disturbed velocity field , with all velocities within 250 km / s of the central velocity of -240 km / s .",
    "\\2 . * near ngc 4438 . *",
    "unusual h@xmath0 filaments were previously detected in ngc  4438 , extending westward as far as 2@xmath1 from the nucleus @xcite . however the new",
    ", deeper observations show h@xmath0 emission with a much larger extent to the west , including a loop of emission extending  5@xmath1 from ngc 4438 , apparently connecting to the filaments located between the 2 galaxies .",
    "only a small fraction of the total h@xmath0 luminosity of ngc  4438 is in the form of small discrete knots consistent with hii regions @xcite .",
    "a galex uv study also shows that the total star formation rate in this disturbed spiral is modest @xcite .",
    "* loop feature nw of m86 . * extending 2 - 8@xmath1 ( 10 - 40 kpc projected ) from m86 to the nw at pa=315@xmath8 is a remarkably well - defined figure 8-shaped h@xmath0 loop .",
    "it has a roughly radial alignment , with total extent of 6@xmath1 in the radial direction , but only 1 - 2@xmath1 in the tangential direction .",
    "this feature includes a linear filament 5@xmath1=22 kpc projected in length , and only 0.1@xmath1 in width implying an aspect ratio of 50:1 , which suggests a minimum of turbulence in this part of m86 s ism .",
    "this h@xmath0 loop is spatially coincident with the bright nw x - ray plume ( figure 2b ) and an associated hi cloud , suggesting that they are all related . unlike the eastern filaments ,",
    "this feature is blueshifted with respect to m86 , with velocities of -230 to -450 km s@xmath9",
    ".    \\4 . * features extending eastward from m86 toward ngc 4438 .",
    "* there are a remarkable series of features east of the m86 nucleus , which clearly extend to the large disturbed spiral galaxy ngc 4438 located 23@xmath1=120 kpc projected away .",
    "these features reach to within 1 - 2@xmath1 of the m86 nucleus , and are centered about a well - defined axis with a pa=82@xmath101 deg which passes through the centers of both galaxies .",
    "there are several distinct features between the 2 galaxies , including a roughly triangular feature  1 - 5@xmath1 east of the m86 nucleus , and a curved arc of emission roughly halfway between the galaxies .",
    "there is a large range in velocities in the triangle feature close to ( 1 - 2@xmath1 e of ) m86 , but otherwise there is a fairly smooth velocity gradient between m86 and ngc 4438 , with -240 km s@xmath9 for m86 ,",
    "-150 km s@xmath9 for the arc between the 2 galaxies , -40 km s@xmath9 for a cloud between the arc and ngc4438 , and + 70 km s@xmath9 for ngc4438 .",
    "the continuity of the kinematics and morphology imply a physical assocation between m86 and ngc  4438 .",
    "the total h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosity of the m86-ngc4438 complex is 1.3@xmath1110@xmath12 erg / s .",
    "of this total , 32% arises within 2@xmath1 of m86 , 50% within 5@xmath1 of n4438 , 12% between the 2 galaxies , and 5% from the nw figure 8 loop .",
    "the h@xmath0+[nii ] luminosity of m86 is in the top 20% of nearby bright ellipticals and s0 s @xcite , and is the 2nd largest among virgo ellipticals with a luminosity @xmath22.5 times lower than m87 in the center of the cluster .",
    "we propose that most of the h@xmath0 features mark a gaseous debris trail and wake caused by the passage of ngc 4438 through the ism of m86 .",
    "this would make the m86-ngc  4438 system the nearest example of a recent high - velocity collision between a large elliptical and large spiral .",
    "ngc  4438 ( arp120 ) is the most heavily disturbed large spiral in the virgo cluster .",
    "the outer stellar disk is disturbed , forming extraplanar tidal arms , indicating a strong gravitational interaction .",
    "the ism of ngc 4438 is even more disturbed than the stars . in particular , all ism tracers in ngc 4438 are displaced to the west of the stellar disk @xcite , on the side toward m86 , where they appear to connect to the large scale h@xmath0 filaments linking ngc  4438 to m86 .",
    "ngc  4438 is very hi - deficient , with an hi mass of 4@xmath1110@xmath13 m@xmath14 , only @xmath25 - 15% of the expected hi mass for a spiral galaxy of its size @xcite .",
    "this suggests that 5@xmath102@xmath1110@xmath15 m@xmath14 of gas has recently been lost from ngc  4438 , or converted into other forms .",
    "while some ram pressure stripping may also be expected from ngc  4438 s passage through the general virgo icm @xcite , the results in this paper ( further developed below ) suggest that most of the ism of ngc 4438 was stripped from its stellar disk by the ram pressure caused by its passage through m86 s ism .",
    "previous papers @xcite have suggested that the enormous disturbances to ngc 4438 are due to a collision with the sb0 galaxy ngc 4435 , which lies very nearby ( only 5@xmath1 away ) on the sky .",
    "however ngc 4435 shows no clear signs of disturbance itself .",
    "its stellar distribution and its small nuclear gas and dust disk appear normal . with a radial velocity 700 km / s higher than that of ngc 4438 , ngc 4435",
    "is probably unrelated to the disturbances of ngc 4438 .",
    "the h@xmath0 imaging and kinematics presented in this paper , showing a clear connection between m86 and ngc 4438 , provides strong evidence that most of the disturbances to ngc 4438 were caused by a collision with m86 . for an average plane - of - sky velocity of 800 km s@xmath9 ( less than peak velocity ) the time since closest approach in the collision would be 100 myr , a timescale consistent with the stellar populations in the outer disk of ngc  4438 @xcite .",
    "cool gas stripped from ngc  4438 is a reasonable explanation for the unusual clouds of hi near m86 @xcite .",
    "figure 2b shows that the two of the largest hi clouds in m86 lie within the eastern h@xmath0 filament system that connects the 2 galaxies , suggesting that they originated from ngc 4438 , and were stripped from it during the collision .",
    "indeed , the lower edge of the southern hi cloud is spatially coincident with the lower h@xmath0 filaments which connect m86 and ngc  4438 .",
    "a 3rd hi cloud is associated with the nw x - ray plume @xcite .",
    "the total hi mass in m86 of 2@xmath1110@xmath13 m@xmath14 @xcite , is a small fraction of the hi missing from ngc  4438 , and the remainder may have been heated and entered another phase within the halo of m86 .",
    "the mass of h@xmath0-emitting gas in uncertain , as it depends on the poorly known gas densities , but small , probably less than 10@xmath16 m@xmath14 @xcite .    while it is pretty clear that the eastern filaments connecting m86 and ngc  4438 are caused by the collision , it is less clear whether the nw h@xmath0 loop and associated x - ray ridge are due to the collision .",
    "previous authors have suggested that this prominent high - surface brightness x - ray ridge in the nw is a tail of gas stripped from m86 as it falls into the virgo icm @xcite .",
    "however , the x - ray morphology of m86 is unlike those in other virgo and fornax e galaxies with evidence for ram pressure stripping , which show sharp , flattened leading surface brightness edges consistent with bowshocks and centered trailing tails @xcite .",
    "there are a number of observations in m86 which are not consistent with a simple stripping picture , and more easily understood in a collision scenario : the presence of an extended x - ray halo which appears mostly relaxed , unlike the complexities in the core @xcite , and the presence of discrete clouds of hi and fir emission at various locations within the halo , including within the nw ridge .",
    "the nw gas ridge may be a ram pressure stripped gas tail disturbed by the collision .",
    "alternately , we propose that the nw x - ray ridge , h@xmath0 loop and hi cloud are related to the incoming part of ngc  4438 s trajectory through the m86 halo , during which most of ngc  4438 s cool gas was stripped and subsequently heated .",
    "the blueshift of this gas relative to m86 , which is opposite that the eastern filaments , is consistent with the following collision scenario : ngc 4438 approaches m86 from behind and as it accelerates toward m86 , it is blueshifted .",
    "gas in a ram pressure stripped tail should be accelerated toward the cluster mean velocity , and therefore redshifted , opposite from what is observed . south of m86 .",
    "a long tail of hi gas stripped from ngc  4388 extends up towards m86 ( oosterloo & van gorkom 2005 ) .",
    "however , the line - of - sight velocity of ngc  4388 and its hi tail range from 2100 - 2500 km / s , much higher than m86 , ngc  4438 , and the h@xmath0 emitting gas .",
    "we have detected the high - velocity extended emission ( shown in green in fig 1 ) previously detected within  5@xmath1 of ngc  4388 @xcite , but no high velocity h@xmath0 emission coincident with the northern parts of the hi tail close to m86 .",
    "this suggests that the hi tail of gas stripped from ngc 4388 may be unrelated to m86 , although this possibility warrants further investigation . ]",
    "cool gas stripped from ngc 4438 and deposited in its wake will be moving within the hot gaseous halo of m86 , and subject to heating .",
    "the source of excitation of the warm ionized gas is unlikely to be uv photoionization from stars , since there are no fuv sources detected from galex @xcite and the h@xmath0 image shows very few compact hii regions .",
    "the spatial correlation of hi , h@xmath0 , and x - ray emission in m86 ( figure 2b ) is suggestive of warm ionized gas at the interface between cold and hot gas , and suggests that the excitation of the h@xmath0 filaments is due to shocks , collisional excitation from ram pressure drag @xcite , or thermal conduction from the hot halo @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy of the gas stripped from ngc 4438 in the collision is likely a significant heating source for the ism of m86 .",
    "the ratio of x - ray to optical luminosity in m86 is significantly higher than the average value for ellipticals @xcite , perhaps a consequence of heating in the collision . in order for ngc 4438 to pass close to the center of m86 , and escape as far away as 120 kpc projected with a relative velocity of more than 300 km s@xmath9 ,",
    "it must have been moving much faster , exceeding the escape speed , which is @xmath21000 km s@xmath9 at r=10 kpc , when it passed through the center . assuming 5@xmath1110@xmath15 m@xmath14 of gas stripped from ngc 4438 during its passage through m86 s gaseous halo , and a relative velocity at closest approach of 1000 km s@xmath9 , the kinetic energy of the stripped ism is 5@xmath1110@xmath17 erg , a significant fraction of which will be absorbed by the ism of m86 in the collision .",
    "this is similar to the thermal energy nktv , of m86 s ism , @xmath210@xmath18 erg , where we have assumed kt=1.0 kev , an average density of n=2@xmath1110@xmath19 cm@xmath19 over the volume v of a sphere with radius of 15@xmath1=73 kpc projected , roughly the area of the rosat x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "thus the collision will be a significant energy source for m86 s ism , and might act to prevent the gas from cooling to form stars .",
    "while there has been significant attention paid recently to the heating effects of agn in early type galaxies , @xcite gravitational heating through collisions , mergers and gas accretion can be a significant heating source @xcite .",
    "while m86 is certainly an extreme case , the effects are easier to study in extreme cases , thus this system will have implications for understanding the ism and icm heating which occurs in the hierarchical assembly of galaxies and clusters .",
