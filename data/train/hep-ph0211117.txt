    "final - state interaction ( fsi ) effects play important role in many physical processes , and in particular in various weak decays . these effects may significantly affect determination of fundamental @xmath5-violating parameters since extraction of the latter requires at least some knowledge of fsi .",
    "the role of fsi in b decays was discussed in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , understanding it constitutes a difficult task for both theory and phenomenology .",
    "our model of coupled - channel final - state interaction is based on a quasielastic approximation and regge pole methods @xcite .",
    "the basic physical idea of regge model is that the high energy behavior of s - channel amplitudes is determined by `` exchanges '' in the crossed channel .",

    "we use the following phase conventions for pseudoscalar mesons : @xmath20    for cabibbo - suppressed @xmath21 decays there are nine possible final states composed of two pseudoscalar mesons . in the basis of definite isospin @xmath22 the symmetrized two - boson states @xmath23 are : @xmath24 quark diagram amplitudes ------------------------    the decays of @xmath21 mesons to two pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath7 ) are described by 7 flavor-@xmath2 invariant amplitudes  @xcite , but only 4 of them ( fig .
