    "biological systems have been studied as networks at different levels : protein - protein interaction network  @xcite , metabolic pathways network  @xcite , gene regulatory network  @xcite , and protein as a network of amino acids  @xcite .",
    "proteins are biological macromolecules made up of a linear chain of amino acids and are organised into three - dimensional structure comprising of different secondary structural elements .",
    "they perform diverse biochemical functions and also provide structural basis in living cells .",
    "it is important to understand how proteins consistently fold into their native - state structures and the relevance of structure to their function .",
    "network analysis of protein structures is one such attempt to understand possible relevance of various network parameters .",
    "there have been several efforts to study proteins as networks .",
    "aszdi and taylor  @xcite compared the linear chain of amino acids in a protein and its three dimensional structure with the help of two topological indices  connectedness and effective chain length  related to path length and degree of foldedness of the chain .",
    "kannan and vishveshwara  @xcite have used the graph spectral method to detect side - chain clusters in three - dimensional structures of proteins . in recent years , with the elaboration of network properties in a variety of real networks , vendruscolo et al .",
    "@xcite showed that protein structures have small - world topology .",
    "they also studied transition state ensemble ( tse ) structures to identify the key residues that play a key role of `` hubs '' in the network of interactions to stabilise the structure of the transition state .",
    "greene and higman  @xcite studied the short - range and long - range interaction networks in protein structures and showed that long - range interaction network is _ not _ small world and its degree distribution , while having an underlying scale - free behaviour , is dominated by an exponential term indicative of a single - scale system .",
    "atilgan et al .",
    "@xcite studied the network properties of the core and surface of globular protein structures , and established that , regardless of size , the cores have the same local packing arrangements . they also explained , with an example of binding of two proteins , how the small - world topology could be useful in efficient and effective dissipation of energy , generated upon binding .    in this study , we model the native - state protein structure as a network made of its constituent amino - acids and their interactions .",
    "the @xmath0 atom of the amino acid has been used as a node and two such nodes are said to be linked if they are less than or equal to a threshold distance apart from each other  @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath1  as the threshold distance .",
    "our results show that proteins are small - world networks regardless of their structural classification across four major groups as enumerated in structural classification of proteins ( scop )  @xcite .",
    "we also highlight the differences in some of the network properties among these classes .",
    "our studies are indicative of the modular nature of these networks .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "our results show that protein networks have `` small - world '' property regardless of their structural classification ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) and tertiary structures ( globular and fibrous proteins ) , even though small but definite differences exist between @xmath2 and @xmath3 classes , and fibrous and globular proteins .",
    "the size independence of the average clustering coefficient in proteins indicates toward an inherent modular organisation in the protein network .    in the cell , starting from a linear chain of amino acids , the protein folds in different secondary motifs such as , the @xmath2 helices and @xmath3 sheets and their mixtures .",
    "these then assume three - dimensional tertiary structures with helices , sheets and random coils , folding to give the final shape that is useful to carry on the biochemical function .",
    "this structure evolves in such a way as to confer stability and also allow transmission of biochemical activity ( binding of ligand , allostery , etc . ) for efficient functioning .",
    "thus the networks built from such proteins are expected to show high clustering and also reflect its modular or hierarchically folded organisation . unlike other hierarchical networks  @xcite that are modelled to form by replicating a core set of nodes and links , this network primarily grows linearly first , and then this polypeptide chain organises itself in a modular manner at different levels ( secondary and tertiary )",
    ". evolution of such type of network architectures demands further study ."
