    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has started to explore the tev energy regime opening up the possibility of discovering new fundamental particles .",
    "one such particle , which arises in many models of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and should be relatively straightforward to discover , is a new , massive , spin-1 , s - channel resonance ( @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "although such a resonance could arise as a kaluza - klein excitation of the photon or the sm @xmath3 @xcite , we restrict our attention to @xmath0s arising from an extended gauge symmetry . for these models , contributions to precision electroweak observables generally imply a mass bound @xmath4 tev  @xcite , and recent estimates  @xcite indicate that the lhc should be able to probe far beyond these bounds , up to @xmath5  5 tev once the lhc reaches its design energy and luminosity .",
    "while direct detection of new particles is unambiguous , precision measurements provide a complementary approach to exploring new physics @xcite .",
    "for example , precision electroweak ( ew ) measurements impose comparable or stronger bounds than direct detection on many @xmath0 bosons @xcite , and ew constraints on oblique parameters  @xcite are difficult to avoid in other new physics scenarios . one important recent update to the ew observables",
    "is a better than 1% extraction of the @xmath1cs weak charge @xcite from apv experiments @xcite @xmath6 the new determination is in perfect agreement with the sm prediction of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it has since been noted that this measurement provides strong constraints on the @xmath8 parameter  @xcite and it can act as the dominant observable in global analysis of precision measurements used to constrain models of new physics  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath9 has been measured to a precision that can significantly constrain new physics @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the implications of apv experiments on the physics of @xmath0 bosons .",
    "we consider both the @xmath9 result and observables from a number of future apv experiments which are expected to perform measurements of weak charges along the isotope chains of ba  @xcite , fr  @xcite , ra  @xcite and yb  @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we also consider the implications of other experiments measuring parity violation ; the qweak measurement of the proton weak charge at jefferson lab  @xcite , the p2 experiment at mainz @xcite , and the solid deep inelastic measurement at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "the presence of a @xmath0 would result in an @xmath10 correction to a weak charge .",
    "this effect has been discussed in the literature  @xcite , but only a small subset of @xmath0 models were considered .",
    "we expand on these earlier studies by considering @xmath0s from the following classes of models : little higgs ( lh ) @xcite , left - right symmetric ( lr ) , technicolor ( tc ) @xcite , 3 - 3 - 1 @xcite , e@xmath11 @xcite , and the ununified model ( uum ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite contain details of these models and their phenomenology .",
    "our analysis consists of two parts .",
    "we first examine how measurements in apv experiments , including the @xmath9 result , can be used to bound the @xmath0 mass for various models . given the sensitivity of apv measurements to @xmath2 physics , we also examine how they could be used to constrain the properties of a newly discovered @xmath2 .",
    "we find that apv experiments can provide strong constraints on the @xmath12- and @xmath13-quark couplings of a new @xmath0 that are otherwise difficult to obtain , and could provide valuable information that complements other measurements .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : apv ] we outline the equations and conventions we use in our analysis . in the remaining subsections ,",
    "we discuss mass bounds coming from @xmath9 , weak charge ratios in isotopes of fr and yb , and the proton weak charge , and other parity violation experiments . in section",
    "[ sec : coupl ] we examine how these measurements can constrain the couplings of a @xmath0 and help distinguish between different models .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the nuclear weak charge of an isotope of element @xmath14 with @xmath3 protons and @xmath15 neutrons , or @xmath16 nucleons , can be written @xcite @xmath17 where a 0 superscript will denote a sm prediction , and a @xmath18 will denote a new physics contribution . for the nuclear weak charge , the tree level sm prediction is given by @xcite @xmath19 \\nonumber\\\\    & = & -n + z \\left ( 1 - 4 s_w^2 \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 are the sm @xmath3 boson couplings to fermions and @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being the weak mixing angle  @xcite .    at the sub - mev energies of atomic physics , we can use the effective lagrangian to describe the sm neutral current interaction between an electron @xmath23 and a fermion @xmath24  @xcite .",

    "it is understood that @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , we can write the effective lagrangian for the neutral current interaction of a @xmath30 boson with mass @xmath31 @xmath32 ( \\bar{e } \\gamma_\\mu \\gamma_5 e ) (   \\bar{f } \\gamma^\\mu f ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are defined for the @xmath35 interactions in analogy with the sm quantities in eqn .  [ sm ] .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the new physics contribution to the weak charge of a particle from eqn .",
    "[ efflag ] , and for the proton and neutron , we find @xmath36    the corrections to the weak charge of a given isotope can now be built from the above quantities @xmath37 from eqns .",
    "[ np ] and [ nucl ] it can be seen that a new neutral gauge boson does indeed modify weak charges by contributions of order @xmath10 .",
    "using eqn .",
    "[ nucl ] , a precise determination of any weak charge can be readily translated into a bound on @xmath0 physics .",
    "for example , the recent measurement of @xmath9 can be used to obtain a mass bound on a model with fixed @xmath30 couplings .",
    "we find , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the @xmath30 arising in the e@xmath11 @xmath38 model would result in a correction of @xmath39 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath9 given in eqn .",
    "[ result ] implies @xmath40 tev at 84% cl .",
    "analogous mass bounds for various other @xmath30 models are given in table  [ table : tag ] .",
    "we note that these mass bounds are derived using only the @xmath9 measurement and a global fit including the precision ew data , etc . would improve these constraints @xcite .",
    "however , by considering the @xmath41 measurement on its own , we can compare its sensitivity to that of other @xmath2 limits .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : tag ]    the simplest and anomaly free lh @xmath0s are particularly well constrained since they predict large , positive values for both @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which combine to give a large overall value for @xmath44 .",
    "the opposite is true for the uum , sequential sm , littlest higgs and models with an su@xmath45su@xmath46 group structure such as lr and extended tc . for these models @xmath47 and @xmath48 have opposite sign and the partial cancellation results in weak constraints from @xmath9 .",
    "finally , apv experiments can not constrain the e@xmath11 @xmath49 model , since it has @xmath50 which implies no correction to any nuclear weak charge .      improving",
    "the determination of @xmath9 would require theoretical improvements in addition to the experimental efforts , and the mass bounds in the second column of table  [ table : tag ] are not likely to be improved in the near future .",
    "however , the next generation of apv experiments is underway , in ba @xcite , fr @xcite , ra@xcite and yb @xcite , each of which is well - suited to apv experiments because they are expected to exhibit large parity violation , and there are multiple stable isotopes of each of these elements .",
    "we mention for completeness a proposal to measure the weak charges of an isotope chain of cs @xcite at the level of 0.2% . with multiple isotopes ,",
    "a ratio can be exploited to largely cancel the required atomic and nuclear theory input @xcite . using measurements of weak charges along isotope chains ,",
    "the following ratios can be defined @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the weak charges of two isotopes of element x. by circumventing large atomic theory uncertainty in this way , future apv experiments hope to probe the standard model at the sub-1@xmath53 level .    of the two observables in eqn .",
    "[ rr ] , we find that @xmath54 is the more sensitive probe of @xmath0 physics .",
    "we therefore restrict our discussion to @xmath54 and suggest that future experiments measure this quantity .",
    "we consider the corrections arising from new physics , which can be represented by @xmath55 } { ( n^\\prime + n)(1 - \\delta q_w^n ) - 2z(1 - 4 s_w^2 + \\delta q_w^p ) } \\\\ & \\approx & \\left ( \\frac{2z}{n^{\\prime } + n } \\right ) \\delta q_w^p\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the standard model prediction .",
    "the approximation follows by setting @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and agrees with the result of ramsey - musolf @xcite .",
    "we use the exact formula to obtain our numerical results .",
    "the @xmath59 dependence of eqn .  [ deltar ] resides in the @xmath60 terms and , as with @xmath61 , a determination of @xmath54 can be translated into a mass bound on @xmath31 . since these experiments have not yet taken place , we derive expected mass bounds by assuming that a given experiment has made a measurement in agreement with the sm , with an error as given in table  [ table : tag ] .",
    "there is a subtlety when calculating mass bounds from @xmath62 .",
    "some models counterintuitively predict a small value of @xmath62 for small @xmath59 , so that a measurement of @xmath63 only excludes a mass region @xmath64 .",
    "however , in every model we consider , @xmath65 is small enough that it is already ruled out by other experiments and this issue can be safely ignored .",
    "the mass bounds from @xmath54 are largest for the lightest isotopes as can be seen from eqn .",
    "[ deltar ] .",
    "the values given in table  [ table : tag ] are therefore calculated using the lighter isotopes to be studied for a given element .",
    "furthermore , the mass bounds are not sensitive to small differences in proton number @xmath3 , which is apparent from the fr and yb mass bounds in table  [ table : tag ] , so we do not also list those of ba and cs . likewise , the stable isotopes of ra and fr have nearly identical atomic numbers and we find that the mass bounds from the two nuclei are very similar , so we only list only those of fr .",
    "thus , we conclude that each of the future apv experiments is sensitive to the same region of parameter space and claim , very generally , that these experiments should aim to measure @xmath63 with at least @xmath5 0.3% precision to probe new physics .",
    "we see in table  [ table : tag ] that at this precision , future apv experiments , for some models , will begin to probe a higher mass region than the current measurement of @xmath9 .    since the observables in eqn .",
    "[ rr ] consist of weak charge ratios , there could be new physics models that might mimic the sm model prediction for @xmath66 and thus remain unconstrained .",
    "for example , this happens in new physics scenarios that contribute to the nuclear weak charge in proportion to the sm prediction @xmath67 . from eqn .",
    "[ deltar ] we can see that @xmath68 if @xmath69 .",
    "( this relation is lost if the approximate formula in eqn .",
    "[ deltar ] is used . )",
    "this defines a line in @xmath0 coupling space @xmath70 describing theories that are unconstrained by measurements of @xmath63 .",
    "the lr model and the sequential sm fall on this line , hence their trivial mass bounds in the @xmath71 to @xmath72 columns of table  [ table : tag ] .",
    "this behaviour is obvious for the sequential sm @xmath30 , since it has couplings identical to the sm @xmath3 .",
    "however , it happens through a cancellation in the lr model , which has @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 . in this case",
    ", the product which governs the weak charge corrections @xmath76 is indeed proportional to the sm prediction , hence the trivial mass bounds .",
    "consequently , we suggest that a measurement of @xmath77 in a given element be accompanied by an extraction of @xmath78 .",
    "the two quantities , @xmath79 and @xmath77 , are complementary , since @xmath79 is sensitive to both @xmath80 and @xmath81 , whereas @xmath77 is predominantly sensitive to @xmath47 , to the extent that the approximations in eqn .",
    "[ deltar ] are valid .",
    "this suggestion assumes that atomic and nuclear theory uncertainties are not overwhelming @xcite , despite the fact that the rationale for using ratios of isotopes was to reduce the impact of atomic and nuclear theory uncertainties in the extraction @xmath82 from the apv observables , because these uncertainties are large .",
    "nonetheless , let us optimistically consider the case in which the theoretical uncertainties could be reduced to the same level of precision as the experimental measurements so that @xmath82 could be determined from apv measurements to a combined uncertaintly of , for example , 0.1% .",
    "the mass bounds that could be obtained from a measurement of @xmath83 at this precision are included in table  [ table : tag ] .",
    "we see that one could approximately double the @xmath84 bounds obtained from @xmath85 .",
    "one would obtain comparable results for the other isotopes being studied .",
    "we emphasize that the key to these results is reducing the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "if this reduction in theoretical uncertainty is possible , then it also becomes interesting to consider a combination of @xmath82 from different isotopes that would cancel the proton contribution , thereby isolating the neutron contribution .",
    "we define a quantity @xmath86 from which the correction arising from new physics is given by @xmath87 note that @xmath88 is independent of @xmath15 and @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 would constrain the @xmath2 couplings in a manner that would complement the other weak charge constraints as we will show below .",
    "in addition to the apv observables , we have included the bounds that can be extracted from measurements of the proton weak charge @xmath91 by the qweak experiment at jefferson lab @xcite which has recently started taking data . the new physics correction to the weak charge of the proton",
    "is given by @xmath92 and we see that this observable is sensitive to the same physics as the apv observables . in the @xmath93 column of table  [",
    "table : tag ] we list expected bounds from qweak that assume a measurement of @xmath91 in agreement with the sm prediction at @xmath94 precision .",
    "these expected bounds are generally comparable to the actual bounds obtained from @xmath9 although in a few cases [ uum , lh , etc , tc2 ] they surpass the @xmath9 bounds and will not be exceeded by apv measurements until @xmath63 is measured at the highest precision in the future . however , the p2 experiment at the mami facility in mainz is under development with the goal of measuring the proton weak charge @xmath91 to 2.1% precision @xcite .",
    "the bounds that could be extracted from measurement of @xmath91 by the p2 experiment are also included in table  [ table : tag ] .",

    "we do not include bounds that could be obtained on @xmath2 masses from the moller experiment in table  [ table : tag ] as for most , although not all models , they fall below the bounds obtained by the @xmath9 measurement .",
    "however it is important to note , as pointed out by li , petriello and quakenbush , that the moller experiment could provide important information on determining @xmath2 couplings , complementary to lhc measurements @xcite .",
