    "the terminal stage in the evolution of massive stars ( m @xmath8 10 m@xmath9 ) is characterized by very short timescales ( @xmath6 10@xmath10 yr ) and drastic changes in their immediate circumstellar environment . in the red supergiant phase , periods of large mass loss release a thick circumstellar envelope of molecular gas and dust .",
    "understanding the mass loss process from red supergiants is extremely important in that it will eventually govern their evolution as well as the structure of their surrounding envelope . in a galactic context , supergiants contribute to the enrichment of the interstellar medium in dust and heavy elements and participate to the global galactic chemical evolution .",
    "vy canis majoris ( vy  cma ) is one of the brightest known red supergiants .",
    "its distance has long been debated @xcite , but there is now a consensus on a value of 1.5 kpc , consistent with the velocity and proper motions of h@xmath11o masers @xcite .",
    "the stellar luminosity is estimated to @xmath6 2 10@xmath12 l@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass is thought to be @xmath13 15 m@xmath9 .",
    "the basic properties of vy  cma are summarized in table 1 .",
    "vy  cma is characterized by an apparent very high mass loss rate , of order 2  4 10@xmath14 m@xmath9/yr ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , which produced a very thick circumstellar envelope of dust and molecules , which almost completely obscurs the central star .",
    "the optical / infrared morpholgy of the nebulosity around vy  cma is very complex , showing arcs , filaments , bright knots in a very complicated arrangement @xcite .",
    "long slit spectroscopy @xcite reveals a very complex kinematics with evidence for localized and episodic mass loss events .",
    "@xcite showed that the prominent arcs are expanding relative to the star and represent discrete ejection events .",
    "the ejection dates are ranging from 200 to 1000 years ago and state that vy  cma has had a period of major activity during the past 1000 years .",
    "these works however rely on scattered lights which may reflect only the illuminated part of the nebula and the origin of the features seen in the optical and near infrared images is very uncertain .",
    "we note that in a recent paper , @xcite propose a theoretical model , based on a spherically symmetric envelope , that requires time varying mass - loss rates to reproduce previous single - dish co multi - line spectra .",
    "the high angular resolution view offered by the submillimeter array ( sma ) now provides new constraints on the structure and kinematics of the circumstellar molecular envelope of this peculiar object . in this paper , we present our sma observations and discuss about the morphology and kinematics of the molecular envelope around vy  cma .",
    "we propose a simple model to explain our data and compare with observations at other wavelengths .",
    "we obtained 1.3 mm interferometric observations of vy  cma with the submillimeter array ( sma , @xcite ) , which consists of eight 6 m antennas , located on top of the mauna kea , hawaii .",

    "a second track was observed on 2005 january 19@xmath22 , with 7 antennas in an extended configuration .",
    "the projected baselines ranged from 18 to 192 m. the system temperatures were between 200 and 400 k. the bandpass was calibrated using uranus and/or jupiter , while callisto set the flux calibration .",

    "the data reduction and calibration were done under mir / idl .",
    "imaging and data analysis were entirely processed under gildas .",
    "the heterodyne receivers were tuned to allow multi - line observations including the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) line in the upper side band ( usb ) and the @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) and so(6@xmath4 - 5@xmath5 ) lines in the lower side band ( lsb ) .",
    "the sma correlator bandwidth is 2 ghz wide for each sidebands , which are separated by 10 ghz .",
    "the instrumental spectral resolution was 0.8125 mhz , but we smoothed it to 3.25 mhz ( _ i.e. _ @xmath6 4 km  s@xmath23 ) for the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and so(6@xmath4 - 5@xmath5 ) lines and to 8.125 mhz ( _ i.e. _ @xmath6 11 km  s@xmath23 ) in the case of @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) .",

    "we estimate a rms noise level of 8 mjy / beam in this continuum map .",
    "the channel maps of the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and so(6@xmath4 - 5@xmath5 ) line emission were obtained using natural weighting and gaussian tapering with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 130 m , making a compromise between brigthness sensitivity and angular resolution .",
    "the @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) map was derived using a taper distance of 80 m to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the resulting synthesized beam sizes and 1@xmath24 noise levels are reported in table 2 .",
    "the continuum visibilities were subtracted before imaging .",
    "all the maps were deconvolved with a standard clean / clark algorithm .    at 230 ghz ,",
    "the fwhm of the 6 m sma antennas primary beam is 54@xmath1 . the shortest projected baseline being 8 m , we may loose informations on structures larger than 40@xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting coverage of the uv - plane is rather scarce until 18 m. we may therefore also miss part of the emission associated with structures larger than 18@xmath1 , although we show in  [ molecularspectra ] from the comparison of the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) sma and single dish data , that the missing flux is limited to less than 20 % .",
    "@xcite observed vy  cma at centimeter wavelengths using the vla .",
    "they do not resolve the source at an angular resolution of @xmath6 1@xmath1 at 1.3 cm .",
    "they also present keck mid - infrared imaging and show that the dust emission is elongated in the south - west direction ( pa = 227 ) with fwhm @xmath6 0.4@xmath1 and 0.3@xmath1 at 11.7 and 17.9 @xmath25 respectively . from diffraction - limited speckle interferometry ,",

    "thus , at near - ir wavelengths , the size of the dust - emitting region decreases towards shorter wavelengths , progressively tracing warmer dust close to the star .",
    "as seen from fig.[figcont ] , the continuum emission is not resolved by our synthesized beam ( @xmath6 1.4@xmath1 ) .",

    "our measurement of the flux density is consistent with the value of 270 @xmath26 40 mjy from previous sma observations at 215 ghz @xcite but differs from the previous bolometric values of 630 @xmath26 65 mjy obtained with the jcmt @xcite and 378 @xmath26 20 mjy with the sest @xcite .",
    "part of the difference could be explained by contamination from line emission in the bolometric observations .",
    "we note , however , that even the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) line , presumably the strongest in this frequency band , contributes only for about 2% and 7% of the total flux density measurements with the jcmt and sest , respectively . on the other hand",
    ", we can not exclude the presence of an extended low surface brigthness emission that could have been missed in our observations .",
    "independant checks of the continuum flux density in the upper and lower side bands give consistent values within 10% , implying that our measurements are not severly contaminated by weak line emission .    because the continuum emission is of order of @xmath6 1 mjy in the centimeter wavelenghts @xcite and given that the contribution of the central star ( black body emission ) amounts for s@xmath27 @xmath6 10 mjy , _",

    "the ratio of ir fluxes indicates a temperature t@xmath36 @xmath6 250 k in the dust shell @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we derive a dust mass of 1.5 10@xmath37 m@xmath9 , close to the value m@xmath36 = 1.3 10@xmath37 m@xmath9 given by @xcite . assuming",
    "that the dust is uniformly distributed within a radius comparable to our synthesized beam ( upper limit of 1.4@xmath1 ) , the optical depth towards the central star would be @xmath38 @xmath6 0.01 .",
    "furthermore , assuming an expanding velocity v@xmath39 = 15 km  s@xmath23 ( similar to the escape velocity of @xmath6 20 km  s@xmath23 at the dust formation radius , see also  [ model ] ) leads to an age of order of 300 years .",
    "the average mass loss rate over this timescale is 4.7 10@xmath14 m@xmath9/yr , assuming an isotropic mass loss and a dust - to - gas ratio of 100 .",
    "this value is slightly higher than previous measurements for vy  cma ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) and comparable to mass loss rates estimated for other supergiants @xcite . @xcite and @xcite showed that localized and short - term ejection events in vy  cma could in fact reach 10@xmath37 m@xmath9/yr .    on the other hand ,",
    "as pointed out by the referee , there is a possibility that the continuum dust emission originates from a circumstellar disk , as advocated earlier by @xcite and @xcite from observations of oh and h@xmath11o maser emissions .",
    "however , the angular resolution of our current data is not enough to constrain this possibility .",
    "the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) emission ( fig.[fig12co ] ) extends to @xmath6 7@xmath1 around the central star and is detected over a ( lsr ) velocity range @xmath1825 to 70 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "there are three distinct emission peaks in the channel maps : a first one at a velocity of about @xmath185 km  s@xmath23 with an offset of 1@xmath1 to the east , a second one close to the systemic velocity of vy  cma ( v@xmath40 @xmath6 22 km  s@xmath23 ) , centered on the stellar position and a third one around + 45 km  s@xmath23 with an offset of 1@xmath1 to the west .",
    "the line emission is stronger in the western redshifted part of the nebula , where it reaches @xmath6 5 jy / beam .",
    "the velocity channels around the systemic velocity of vy  cma ( 12 @xmath0 v@xmath41 @xmath0 33 km  s@xmath23 ) show a north - south elongated structure of roughly 5@xmath1 x 3@xmath1 , embedded in a more diffuse envelope .",

    "the morphology and kinematics of the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) emission around vy  cma do not reproduce those of a typical spherical expanding shell .",
    "we interpret the east and west offset bright peaks , with high velocity relatively to the systemic velocity , as the signature of a east - west bipolar outflow .",
    "@xcite already suggested the presence of a bipolar outflow around vy  cma from the butterfly like shape of the sio(1 - 0 ) emission .",
    "the idea was further supported by sio masers linear polarization measurements @xcite , which result in a mean polarization position angle of 72@xmath7 , in the axis of the sio bipolar structure .",
    "previous observations of oh @xcite and h@xmath11o @xcite masers also show some elongation in a similar direction with position angles of 50@xmath7 and 60@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "however , the maser emission is clumpy and might not trace the complete geometry of the outflow .",
    "in addition , the 1.3 mm continuum and co emission around the systemic velocity indicate the presence of a central dense component . the position - velocity diagrams ( fig.[figpv ] ) , along the east - west and north - south directions , _",
    "i.e. _ along and perpendicular to the outflow axis , support our interpretation .",
    "along the east - west direction , the high velocity bipolar outflow and the slowly expanding shell appear clearly as two distinct kinematic components .",
    "the bipolar outflow emission shows a point symmetry relative to the stellar position .",
    "it extends to roughly 5@xmath1 from the star and has a velocity up to 45 km  s@xmath23 with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "this corresponds to a timescale of about 800 yr , comparable to the past period of strong mass loss activity @xcite .",
    "the slowly expanding envelope can be seen out to a radius of roughly 5@xmath1 .",
    "given an expansion velocity of 15 km  s@xmath23 ( see  [ model ] ) , the corresponding timescale is 2400 yr . the overall features are similar in the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and so(6@xmath4 - 5@xmath5 ) position - velocity diagrams , indicating that they arise from the same regions .",
    "we present in fig.[figspec ] the spectra of the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) , @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) and so(6@xmath4 - 5@xmath5 ) lines , taken at the central position and convolved to a beam size of fwhm 19@xmath207 , equal to the jcmt beam at 230 ghz .",
    "the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) line profile obtained from our interferometric data can then be directly compared to the single - dish @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) spectrum @xcite at the same angular resolution . the @xmath2co(2 - 1 )",
    "sma spectrum shows three peaks at v@xmath41 @xmath6 @xmath185 , 20 and 45 km  s@xmath23 , similar with the jcmt spectrum .",
    "the high velocity channels ( v@xmath41 @xmath0 5 and @xmath8 35 km  s@xmath23 ) reach the same brightness temperature as the single - dish observations , indicating that the interferometer recovered all of the emission for these velocities .",
    "close to the systemic velocity of vy  cma , _",
    "i.e. _ for 5 @xmath0 v@xmath41 @xmath0 30 km  s@xmath23 , there is a small difference between the two profiles , although less than @xmath6 20% of the emission is lost by the interferometer .",
    "we estimate the integrated intensity of the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) line to 65 k  km  s@xmath23 , comparable to the value of 66 @xmath26 7 k  km  s@xmath23 reported by @xcite .",
    "the integrated intensities of the @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) and so(6@xmath4 - 5@xmath5 ) lines are estimated to 4 k  km  s@xmath23 and 28 k  km  s@xmath23 , respectively .",

    "while carbon chemistry is mostly absent in the circumstellar envelope ( cse ) of o - rich stars , most of the carbon being locked up in co , sulfur chemistry is expected to be relatively active .",

    "observations of @xcite towards the bipolar nebula oh  231.8 + 4.2 show a similar trend .",
    "these authors argue for the presence of so both in the central component and in the accelerated lobes , with no significant difference in abundance between the two components .",
    "assuming optically thin emission and an excitation temperature of t@xmath43 = 40 k @xcite , we estimate a so column density @xmath6 10@xmath44 @xmath45 towards the center .",
    "the corresponding so abundance relative to h@xmath11 is @xmath6 10@xmath46 .",
    "high angular resolution observations of other s - bearing species such as h@xmath11s and so@xmath11 would provide a better understanding of the sulfur chemistry and put stronger constraints for chemical models .",
    "we have constructed a simple model in order to better understand the geometry and physical conditions within the circumstellar envelope around vy  cma .",
    "the combination of our high angular resolution co(2 - 1 ) data together with previous single dish observations of multiple co rotational transitions @xcite provides very useful constraints for our model and leads us to a coherent picture of the envelope .",
    "the geometry of our model is illustrated in fig.[figsketch ] .",
    "the envelope is assumed to be axisymmetric and radially expanding .",
    "the bipolar outflow direction defines the symmetry axis of the envelope .",
    "we project the envelope directly into a regular 3-d grid . at each grid point , the gas density , kinetic temperature and expansion velocity can be specified .",
    "the emerging co intensity along each ray through the envelope is calculated by integrating directly the standard radiation transfer equation .",
    "we take into account 15 rotational levels of the co molecule in its vibrational ground state .",
    "the populations on the different rotational levels , which are necessary for the calculation of the line opacity and source function at each grid point , are determined by solving the statistical equilibrium equations within the framework of the large velocity gradient formalism .",
    "the collision rates between co and molecular hydrogren are taken from @xcite and calculated for different temperatures using the prescription of @xcite . because the envelope around vy  cma is oxygen rich ,",
    "we adopt an abundance f = [ co]/[h@xmath11 ] = 3 10@xmath14 as used in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "the local line profile , which is needed to integrate the radiative transfer equation , is determined through the turbulence velocity of the molecular gas .",
    "we assume a turbulence velocity of 1 km  s@xmath23 in the slowly expanding envelope and 3 km  s@xmath23 in the bipolar lobes , respectively .",
    "this assumption is reasonable as a higher outflow velocity in the lobe would result in more turbulent environment .    as discussed in ",
    "[ molecularline ] , two distinct kinematic components are clearly present in the nebula around vy  cma : ( 1 ) a slowly expanding envelope slightly elongated in the north - south direction surrounded by a diffuse halo with some extension toward the north - west direction and ( 2 ) a high velocity bipolar outflow oriented in the east - west direction . however , to keep our model as simple as possible , we assume that the slowly expanding component is spherically symmetric .",
    "we adopt an expansion velocity of 15 km  s@xmath23 for this component , which allows us to satisfactorily fit the central peak seen in single - dish co observations .",
    "the presence of diffuse emission suggests that the gas density in the slowly expanding envelope peaks more sharply toward the center than for the case of constant mass loss .",
    "we therefore adopt a simple density distribution n(@xmath48 ) = 4.5 10@xmath12 ( 10@xmath44 cm/@xmath48)@xmath49 , which deviates slightly from the usual density distribution generated by constant mass loss .",
    "this adopted distribution corresponds to a mass loss rate @xmath50 = 4.5 10@xmath51 ( 10@xmath44 cm/@xmath48)@xmath52 m@xmath9/yr , or a decrease in mass loss rate by a factor of 4 between the inner radius ( r@xmath53 and the outer radius ( r@xmath54 ) .",
    "the kinetic temperature of the molecular gas in the oxygen - rich circumstellar envelopes with constant mass loss has been known to roughly follow a power law t(@xmath48 ) @xmath6 @xmath55 from the modelling works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although the mass loss rate in the slowly expanding envelope of vy  cma is not strictly constant , resulting probably in some slight change in the temperature profile in comparison to the simple constant mass loss case , we expect that qualitatively , the temperature profile still follows the power law .",
    "therefore , we assume in our calculations , for the sake of simplicity , that the kinetic temperature varies as t(@xmath48)= 500 k ( 2.25 10@xmath56 cm/@xmath48)@xmath57 , which is similar to that used by @xcite to model the oxygen - rich circumstellar envelopes .    in order to reproduce the velocity gradient seen in the position - velocity diagrams ( fig.[figpv ] ) , the outflow velocity in the bipolar lobes is allowed to increase linearly with radial distance from the central star . in addition , the outflow velocity in the bipolar lobes also varies as a function of the polar angle @xmath58 measured from the bipolar axis .",
    "the strong emission peaks at large velocity shifts suggest the presence of an enhanced density shell within the bipolar lobes . however , this density enhancement is more pronounced in the receeding lobe as clearly seen in the position - velocity diagram . with the density enhancement included in the model",
    ", we find that the bipolar lobes and the slowly expanding shell can account for the highly unusual triple peak profile of single - dish co lines observed by @xcite ( see fig.[figspecco ] ) .",
    "the intensities of the co lines calculated along individual lines of sight are used to form the model channel maps ( fig.[figchanmodel ] ) .",
    "we convolve these model channel maps with a gaussian beam with specified fwhm to produce the model co line profiles , which are indicated by the dashed lines and compared with the jcmt observations of @xcite in fig.[figspecco ] .",
    "we infer from our modelling that the velocity of the gas in the lobes increases linearly from 15 km  s@xmath23 , which is similar to the expansion velocity of the spherical envelope , to 45 km  s@xmath23 at the outer radius .",
    "the bipolar outflow is found to be very open , with an opening angle of 120@xmath7 , and inclines at 15@xmath7 from the line of sight .",
    "all the model parameters , which provide a reasonable fit to both the sma and single dish data , are shown in table 3 .",
    "although relatively simple , our model provides a qualitative understanding of the single dish data obtained by @xcite and also of the structure of the envelope ( figs.[figspecco ] , [ figchanmodel ] , [ figpvmodel ] ) . the high angular resolution sma data show that the co(2 - 1 ) emission originating from the high velocity bipolar lobes produces a double horn profile at roughly @xmath2620 km  s@xmath23 from the systemic velocity .",
    "the central broad peak of the co(2 - 1 ) line comes from the slow component .",
    "higher transitions of co probe progressively warmer and denser gas located in the inner part of the envelope .",
    "however , both the density and temperature of the gas in the inner region of the bipolar outflow , as suggested by our model , are lower than that in the slowly expanding envelope . as a result ,",
    "the central peak becomes more prominent in higher transitions while the strength of the emission from the bipolar lobes decreases noticeably .",
    "in addition , the lower outflow velocity in the inner part of the bipolar lobes also leads to a narrower full width at zero velocity for higher transitions of co. this behavior can be clearly seen in fig.[figspecco ] .    by comparing the model prediction for the strength of the @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) line with our sma observations",
    ", we estimate the isotopic ratio @xmath2c/@xmath3c = 60 .",
    "this ratio is significantly larger than the values @xmath2c/@xmath3c = 6 and 12 found in the red supergiants @xmath59 ori and @xmath59 sco , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is likely that , prior to the current mass loss episode , vy  cma experienced no significant mixing of h burning products to the surface .",
    "our model predicts that most of the @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) line emission should arise from the bipolar outflow ( fig.[fig13comodel ] ) , which is consistent with our sma imaging data ( fig.[fig13co ] ) .",
    "we emphasize here that our model is constructed to explain the general features of the high resolution sma data and single - dish co observations .",
    "other features such as the slight elongation of the slowly expanding shell and the more complicated structure within the bipolar lobes are not considered .",
    "however , our model could serve as a useful starting point when higher angular resolution data of co(2 - 1 ) and higher transitions become available in the future .",
    "our high angular resolution co(2 - 1 ) data bring a clearer overall picture of the molecular envelope around the enigmatic red supergiant vy  cma .",
    "the envelope consists of two kinematic components : a slowly expanding shell slightly elongated in the north - south direction and a high velocity bipolar outflow oriented in the east - west direction with small inclination angle to the line of sight .",
    "the presence of these two kinematic components have already been hinted in previous observations of h@xmath11o and oh masers @xcite .",
    "given the small inclination angle @xmath6 15@xmath7 of the bipolar outflows to the line of sight , as derived from our model and assuming uniform illumination in the nebula , one would expect that the envelope appears only slightly asymmetric with a brighter east lobe ( nearer side ) .",
    "however , optical and near ir images obtained by @xcite and @xcite all show a highly irregular and asymmetric nebula around vy  cma .",
    "the nebula is seen to the west and southwest of the bright point - like source identified as the obscured central star vy  cma and is likely the result of a non - isotropic illumination by the central star . comparing the optical images with our sma data",
    ", we note that the optical nebulosity corresponds to the location of the west ( far side ) lobe and just a small part of the east ( near side ) lobe .",
    "it is therefore likely that the light from vy  cma escapes preferentially in the direction of the west bipolar lobe and scattering on dust brings a fraction of the light back toward the observer .",
    "the strong 1.3 mm continuum emission detected in our data ( see  [ cont ] ) confirms the presence of a thick inner dust shell surrounding vy  cma .",
    "the average optical depth would be so high , if the distribution of material in the dust shell is smooth , that all the stellar light would be completely extincted .",
    "the complex nebula seen in the optical and near ir then suggests that stellar light must be able to escape through some opening or holes in the dust shell , creating search light beams that illuminate the nebula in an irregular pattern .",
    "we note that a similar suggestion was made by @xcite to explain the subtle but peculiar change in the relative position between the star and the brightest knot in the nebula .",
    "the thick and compact inner dust shell detected in 1.3 mm continuum emission might be the region where tio and sco bands @xcite seen in emission originate .",
    "the calculated excitation temperatures of these molecular bands range from 600 to 800 k , suggesting that they come from a hot and dense region located close to the star .",
    "high resolution optical and near ir images of @xcite and @xcite show a very prominent long curved tail or arc to the north - west of vy  cma together with several fainter arcs and condensations in the envelope .",
    "the location of the long northwest arc roughly coincides with the extended and somewhat diffuse co(2 - 1 ) emission in the western part of the envelope ( fig.[fig12co ] ) .",
    "together with strong central emission core , this extended emission is conspicuous in all channel maps redshifted with respect to the central star , most prominent in the velocity range 21  33 km  s@xmath23 and 46  54 km  s@xmath23 . the orientation of this feature changes from west to north - west with increasing velocity upon closer inspection .",
    "we can identify a similar feature in the channel maps of the so emission at the same velocity , although there are some slight differences at higher redshifted velocities , which are probably related to local excitation of the so molecule .",
    "it is therefore possible that the scattering of stellar light by dust in this structure produces the prominent northwest arc seen in optical and near ir images .",
    "future observations of molecular lines at higher angular resolution and detailed modelling of the light scattering by dust inside the envelope will help to clarify the relation between the material distribution and the optical and near ir appearance of the nebula .",
    "recently , @xcite have obtained high resolution long slit spectroscopic data of vy  cma . by measuring the velocity of the reflected stellar absorption lines and",
    "k i emission lines they suggest that the prominent northwest arc is expanding at a velocity of @xmath6 50 km  s@xmath23 on the plane of the sky .",
    "more surprising is the existence of diffuse gas and dust more or less stationary with respect to the central star , mostly along the slit positioned to the southeast of vy  cma ( slit v in their fig.1 ) .",
    "thus , components with very different kinematics seem to co - exist in the nebula . to reconcile the optical spectroscopic data with our sma results , we note that for the simple case of single scattering , the light scattered by moving reflective material ( dust particles ) within the envelope is doppler shifted by v@xmath39(1",
    "@xmath18 cos@xmath60 ) , where v@xmath39 is the expansion velocity and @xmath60 is the angle measured from the line of sight to the radial vector of the scattering point ( see fig.[figsketch ] ) .",
    "the velocity shift can be seen to be largest in the west lobe , which is receeding along the line of sight , because @xmath60 @xmath8 90@xmath7 .",
    "if the association of the extended feature in the west lobe as traced by co emission and the northwest arc is correct , we would expect the velocity shift induced by scattering of moving dust to vary from 15 km  s@xmath23 for material in the arc moving close to the plane of the sky , which is part of the slowly expanding shell , to @xmath6 50 km  s@xmath23 or higher for material within the bipolar lobe .",
    "this simple estimate of the velocity shift is consistent with the measurement of @xcite . for absorption lines seen in scattering through the east lobe",
    ", the velocity shift is expected to be close to zero because the angle @xmath60 is small .",
    "that might explain the presence of dust and gas almost stationary with respect to the star as suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , similar behavior seen in resonant k i lines are still difficult to understand .",
    "there are strong evidences that the mass loss rate in vy  cma is time variable , such as the prominent arc - like features seen in optical @xcite and the relative strength of the co rotational line profiles @xcite .",
    "our modelling results suggest that the mass loss is varying as @xmath6 4.5 10@xmath51 ( 10@xmath44 cm/@xmath48)@xmath52 m@xmath9/yr in the slowly expanding envelope ( v@xmath39 = 15 km  s@xmath23 ) , _ i.e. _ that the mass loss from vy  cma is increasing with time , reaching @xmath6 6.4 10@xmath51 m@xmath9/yr in the inner part of the envelope ( r@xmath53 ) or about 100 years ago . in the bipolar lobes ,",
    "the density enhancement between 5  7 10@xmath44 cm represents an episode of strong mass loss about 350 to 500 years ago , for the expansion velocity of 45 km  s@xmath23 .",
    "the nominal mass loss rate at 6 10@xmath44 cm is 10@xmath37 m@xmath9/yr .",
    "a similar episode of intense mass loss has also been inferred from modelling results of @xcite , although their assumption of spherical symmetry is inadequate to describe the geometry and kinematics of the nebula around vy  cma .",
    "the current mass loss from vy  cma is better traced by dust continuum emission in the mid infrared or millimeter and sub - millimeter wavelengths .",
    "we derived a mass loss rate of 4.7 10@xmath14 m@xmath9/yr from 1.3 mm dust continuum emission .",
    "this value is very close to that obtained by @xcite from fitting infrared spectroscopic data . as already noted by @xcite , the difference between mass loss rate derived from co line profiles and dust continuum suggests that the dust continuum emission originates from the inner dense and hot region ( a few tens of stellar radii from the central star ) , which is not well traced by co low rotational lines .",
    "the origin of the bipolar outflow and the north - south elongated structure in vy  cma is still unclear at present .",
    "however , we note the similarity in morphology ( bipolar outflows and/or disk - like structures ) between the envelope of vy  cma and that around several agb and post - agb stars such as @xmath61 gru @xcite , v hya @xcite , m  2 - 56 @xcite and x her @xcite . the current popular model proposed by @xcite to explain the striking bipolar morphology and the presence of collimated fast outflow in agb and post - agb envelopes involves a low mass binary companion .",
    "the companion can have strong effect on the structure of the envelope .",
    "its gravitational pull can focus the agb wind toward the orbital plane to create an equatorial density enhancement .",
    "in addition , the accretion of wind material into the companion leads to the formation of an accretion disk , which might drive the collimated high velocity outflow .",
    "although the overall morphology of the envelope is similar to that around other agb and post - agb stars , the high velocity wind from vy  cma , as suggested by our data and modelling results , is only weakly collimated with very wide opening angle .",
    "it is conceivable that the interaction between an unseen companion and vy  cma could produce equatorial density enhancement , possibly identified as the elongated structure and induce the collimated fast wind to precess .",
    "subsequent interaction with the nebula would result in wide bipolar lobe .",
    "the prominent curved nebulous tail seen in scattered light and the extended and curved structure seen in our co(2 - 1 ) data might actually trace the precessing outflow . to explain the prominent nebulous tail , @xcite also suggest the existence of a rotating jet and estimate the rotation period of a few thousands years .",
    "that time scale might be related to the orbital period of an unseen companion around vy  cma . however , high resolution images from @xcite suggest that this structure is actually much more complicated than expected from the model of @xcite and probably more consistent with a localized ejection event on the stellar surface .",
    "our currrent sma data can not distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "future high angular resolution observations and monitoring are necessary to determine the distribution of material and kinematics in order to test the presence of a companion .",
    "vy  cma might have magnetic activity , resembling solar flares or eruptions , as suggested by @xcite in order to explain the presence of numerous arcs and bright knots seen in scattered light in the nebula .",
    "we speculate further that the bipolar flow with wide opening angle and the equatorial density enhancement could be similar to what is observed in the solar wind .",
    "the fast solar wind originates from coronal holes located near the poles where magnetic field lines are open and the slower but denser wind comes from the equatorial region .",
    "the geometry of the solar wind is closely coupled to the dipolar field of the sun . in the case of vy  cma ,",
    "the presence and strength of the magnetic field can only be inferred indirectly from observations of sio , h@xmath11o and oh masers .",
    "observations of zeeman effect in sio maser lines suggest a strength of 0  2 g @xcite for the magnetic field around vy  cma . using simple estimates , @xcite and @xcite",
    "suggest that a magnetic field of about 1 g can significantly influence the outflow .",
    "the observed strength of the magnetic field in vy  cma thus suggests that it might affect the dynamics of the wind and if the field is organised on large scale , _",
    "i.e. _ dipolar configuration , it could explain the structure of the envelope as seen in our sma data .",
    "in this paper , we present high angular resolution observations of the circumstellar molecular envelope of the red supergiant vy  cma obtained with the submillimeter array .",
    "thanks to the wide frequency coverage of the sma , we were able to trace the envelope in the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) , @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) and so(6@xmath4 - 5@xmath5 ) lines and dust continuum emission .",
    "we detected a strong and unresolved continuum emission at the center of the nebula .",
    "the derived dust mass is 1.5 10@xmath37 m@xmath9 , implying a lower limit of the recent mass loss of 4.7 10@xmath14 m@xmath9/yr over the last 300 years .",
    "the co(2 - 1 ) emission is resolved into two distinct kinematic components : a slowly ( 15 km  s@xmath23 ) expanding shell elongated in the north - south direction and a high velocity ( 45 km  s@xmath23 ) component with a clear velocity gradient along the east - west direction .",
    "similar structures are also seen in the @xmath3co(2 - 1 ) and so(6@xmath4 - 5@xmath5 ) emission .",
    "we interpret the high velocity component as a bipolar outflow with a wide opening angle ( @xmath6 120@xmath7 ) , for which the symmetry axis is oriented close to the line of sight ( i = 15@xmath7 ) .",
    "using a simple model , we could explain the main features of the co(2 - 1 ) emission in our sma data as well as the previous single - dish co multi - line observations .",
    "density enhancement in the outflows , representing a previous episode of high mass loss , is inferred from our model .",
    "our data complement previous high resolution optical spectroscopy and optical / ir images and provide a better understanding of the complicated morphology of the nebula around vy  cma .",
    "future high resolution and high sensitivity observations of co lines , including high - j transitions , will allow us to study the structure of the envelope and its physical properties in more detail .",
