    "while electron transport and optical - field emission occur in the active core of the device and can be electrically controlled , thermal transport involves the entire large device and is only controlled via thermal boundary conditions that can be far from the active core . ]    in this paper , we overview our recent work on developing a simulation framework capable of capturing the highly nonequilibrium physics of the strongly coupled electron and phonon systems in qcls . in mid - ir devices",
    "@xcite , both electronic and optical phonon systems are largely semiclassical and described by coupled boltzmann transport equations , which we solve using an efficient stochastic technique known as ensemble monte carlo @xcite . the optical phonon system is strongly coupled to acoustic phonons , the dominant carreirs of heat , whose dynamics and thermal transport throughout the whole device are described via a global heat - diffusion solver .",

    "the scattering processes we consider are electron  lo - phonon scattering and electron  electron scattering @xcite .",
    "( interface roughness is important in the optical response @xcite ; it is at present not included in the electron transport simulation , but is a planned near - future addition . )",
    "solving the bte for electrons is well justified in mid - ir qcls , where it has been shown that electronic transport is largely incoherent @xcite .",
    "namely , in the basis of energy eigenstates associated with stages @xcite , which themselves do not carry current as they are localized , calculating the current density requires calculating off - diagonal density matrix elements ( coherences ) between these localized states . when these coherences are very small , they can be approximated as proportional to the occupations of states times the rates of scattering out of the states , which yields the hopping semiclassical picture of transport @xcite .",
    "this picture fails in the limit of infrequent scattering and for large coherences , in general , such as in thz qcls @xcite .",
    "the phonon boltzmann transport equation produces a phonon histogram , recording the phonons that are created and those that are destroyed either by re - absorption by electrons ( not necessarily through the same process that created them ) or due to the decay into acoustic phonons ( considered a random process ; the anharmonic decay time and random numbers are used to simulate the lo phonons decaying into la ones ) .",
    "phonon - phonon scattering rates for many iii - vs are known , the rest can be obtained from first principles , using density - functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) @xcite .",
    "this histogram is also used to recalculate , `` on the fly '' @xcite , the electron ",
    "phonon scattering rates , which are proportional to phonon occupation numbers .",
    "thereby , this simulation self - consistently accounts for electron scattering via nonequilibrim lo phonons .",
    "optical phonons in gaas and other iii - v s have energies in the tens of mev range , so their thermal occupation number , @xmath13 , is low even at room temperature .",
    "for instance , in gaas , the optical phonon energy is 36 mev , so @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "however , in high electric fields , considerable populations of nonequilibrium optical phonons are achieved . in fig .",
    "[ fig : noneqphonons ] , we see the occupation number ( color ) of excess nonequilibrium optical phonons , @xmath9 , versus phonon cross - plane momentum @xmath11 and in - plane momentum @xmath10",
    ". in the high fields ( 70 kv / cm ) , occupations of zone - center phonons can get as high as 2 , nearly four orders of magnitude higher than the thermal phonon occupation at 77 k. this drastic enhancement in phonon population affects electronic transport , especially at low temperatures .",
    "it chiefly amplifies electron absorption of phonons : the rate of absorption is proportional to @xmath16 , so it increases orders of magnitude due to nonequilibrium phonons at 77 k ; the effect is much weaker on phonon emission , whose rate is proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "the increased absorption is actually beneficial , because the lowest injector level is typically below the upper lasing level in energy and phonon absorption is required for injection ; the fact that nonequilibrium phonons drastically amplify the rate of phonon absorption means that the injection rate from the lowest injector level into the upper lasing level is enhanced , which helps with the population inversion and modal gain at low temperatures .",
    "essentially , at low temperatures , where the nonequilibrium phonon number is considerable with respect to thermal phonon number , nonequilibrium phonons improve injection efficiency and modal gain at a given field , and thus reduce the threshold current density .",
    "our work @xcite was the first to show how the presence of nonequilibrium phonons affects the qcl performance metrics that are accessed in experiment , such as the @xmath18 curves , modal gain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modalgain ] ) , and threshold current vs heat - sink temperature ( inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : modalgain ] ) .",
    "we note that the inclusion of nonequilibrium phonons is very important for getting close to the experimentally observed shape of @xmath19 vs @xmath20 ; simulation with nonequilibrium lo phonons gives a much more accurate account of this dependence than the simulation with thermal phonons .",

    "in most nanostructures and at temperatures that are not too low , phonon transport ( dominated by acoustic phonons ) is diffusive and obeys the boltzmann transport equation .",
    "heterostructures are known to be extremely anisotropic thermal conductors , with low cross - plane and high in - plane thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy in thermal conductivity largely stems from anisotropic dispersions ( different phonon group velocities in different directions ) @xcite and transmission through the interface ( fig .",

    ", there exist nonuniform transition layers that behave as an effective atomic - scale interface roughness with some rms height @xmath22 .",
    "this effective interface roughness leads to phonon - momentum randomization and to interface resistance in crossplane transport .",

    "118 , 175101 ( 2015 ) , with the permission of aip publishing . ]    in essence , the influence of the interface roughness is twofold .",
    "first , it lowers the in - plane layer thermal conductivity by affecting the population of acoustic phonon modes .",
    "second , there is interface boundary resistance which is notoriously difficult to understand and compute .",
    "it comprises the effects of acoustic mismatch ( analogue of snell s law , with different materials having different acoustic impedances ) and diffuse scattering at a momentum - randomizing interface .",
    "indeed , the two limiting models for interface boundary resistance stem from the acoustic mismatch model ( amm ) and the diffuse mismatch model ( dmm ) , neither of which doing justice to the high quality interfaces typical for iii - v heterostructures .",
    "we introduced a simple model that interpolates between the two , with the weight of the amm transmission coefficient in the interpolation being the same momentum - dependent specularity parameter related to roughness that is routinely used to address slightly rough nanostructures .",
    "we note that the concept of the specularity parameter assumes that there is no lateral correlation @xcite .",
    "increasing the correlation length makes an interface appear more specular @xcite , so interface correlation can be captured in part with a lower effective rms roughness and a higher effective specularity parameter @xcite .",
    "we were able to fit a large number of disparate measurements by different groups on thermal conductivities of binaries , ternaries , and superlattices .",
    "this technique for calculating the thermal conductivity tensor can also readily account for strain , which is important in short - wavelength qcls .",
    "cross - plane thermal conductivity of gaas / alas superlattices as a function of temperature .",
    "blue circles , orange diamonds , and brown squares show the measured cross - plane thermal conductivity data for 40@xmath2340 , 25@xmath2325 , and 10@xmath2310 superlattices from ref .",

    "all the results incorporate full phonon dispersions .",
    "the experimental superlattices apparently have good - quality interfaces , with rms roughness of only 1 - 2 angstroms ( obtained from fitting theory to experiment with the rms roughness as the only fitting parameter ) ; the small rms roughness is related to the wide , atomically flat terraces .",
