    "calculations of various cross sections in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collision physics in the framework of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) require nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) .",
    "the npdfs are usually presented in a parameterized form , as a product of free - nucleon pdfs and a `` shadowing function''(see e.g. @xcite ) , which depends on @xmath0 and momentum transfer @xmath2 . experimentally extracted shadowing functions are limited by the kinematic range of the data , and fits to these data do not provide the shadowing function in the whole requisite ( @xmath0,@xmath2 ) region for all calculations .",
    "another approach is to utilize gribov theory@xcite , which relates shadowing to diffraction . for the deuteron ,",
    "the relationship involves the interaction of the diffractively scattered ( virtual ) photon with only two nucleons , but for heavy nuclei triple and higher - order scattering may be important and needs to be included in the formalism .",
    "this leads to some model dependence . for nuclear collision applications , npdf uncertainties",
    "contribute significantly to the overall uncertainties of calculated quantities .",
    "thus , an accurate determination of npdfs is of paramount significance .",
    "it is well - established experimentally that for small values of the bjorken variable ( @xmath3 ) , the nuclear structure functions @xmath4 are significantly reduced compared to @xmath5 times the free nucleon structure function @xmath6 , where @xmath5 denotes the mass number of a specific nucleus .",
    "equivalently , the virtual photon - nucleus cross section is less than @xmath5 times the one for free nucleons , @xmath7 .",
    "this phenomenon became known as nuclear shadowing ( in a strict sense ) .",
    "the same behavior is observed for real photons at sufficiently high energies ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "shadowing constitutes the most pronounced nuclear effect in lepton - nucleus deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "( note that in a generalized sense all modifications of the structure function in the entire range of @xmath0 , including regions where @xmath9 , are sometimes referred to as `` shadowing '' . )",
    "the shadowing ratio can be defined as @xmath10 . since the virtual photon - nucleus cross section is proportional to @xmath11 ,",
    "the shadowing ratio can be expressed alternatively as @xmath12 . in this work",

    "several natural length scales may become important in scattering off of a nucleus of mass number @xmath5 .",
    "most important for the present discussion is the average inter - nucleon separation , @xmath15 , of the order of 2 fm .",
    "a high energy ( virtual ) photon scattered from the system can experience nuclear effects in two distinct ways@xcite :    1 .   incoherent scattering from @xmath5 nucleons with modifications to the structure functions due to many - body effects in the nuclear medium ; 2 .",
    "coherent scattering processes involving more than one nucleon at a time .",
    "the latter effects occur when hadronic excitations ( or fluctuations ) produced by the high - energy photon propagate over distances ( in the laboratory frame ) comparable to or larger than the characteristic length scale @xmath16  fm .",
    "shadowing can be understood in terms of coherent scattering on more than one nucleon .",
    "incoherent scattering occurs primarily in the range @xmath17 , while strong coherence effects are manifest at @xmath18 .",
    "the ( virtual ) photon - nucleus cross section can be separated into a part which accounts for the incoherent scattering from individual nucleons , and a correction ( shadowing correction ) from the coherent interaction with several nucleons : @xmath19 the single scattering part is the incoherent sum of photon - nucleon cross sections , where @xmath20 is the nuclear charge number , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the photon - proton and photon - neutron cross sections , respectively .",
    "the multiple scattering correction can be viewed as expanded in terms of the number of nucleons in the target involved in the coherent scattering ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the leading contribution to nuclear shadowing comes from double scattering , since the probability that the propagating hadronic excitation coherently interacts with several nucleons decreases with the number of nucleons . for the deuteron , only the double - scattering term ( @xmath24 )",
    "is present .",
    "we define the shadowing ratio as ^s_a = .",

    "the gribov theory highlights the deep connection between nuclear shadowing and diffraction .",
    "the original formulation relates the correction to the cross section in hadron - deuteron scattering to diffraction off of a nucleon . for the deuteron ( and other light nuclei where double scattering is dominant ) , the shadowing correction can be evaluated without any ambiguity associated with the involvement of more than two target nucleons . for heavier nuclei",
    ", one needs to go beyond double scattering . multiple scattering with @xmath26 nucleons",
    "may contribute significantly to the shadowing correction ( depending on the kinematic regime ) .",
    "these contributions are not model - independent ; therefore the evaluation of the shadowing correction using gribov formalism depends to some extent on the model for the @xmath26 multiple scattering .",

    ", we note that short - range nucleon - nucleon correlations are relevant in nuclei when @xmath43 is comparable to the range of the short - range repulsive part of the nucleon - nucleon force , i.e. for distances @xmath44 .",
    "however , shadowing is negligible in this case .",
    "short - range correlations are therefore not important in the shadowing domain , and the target can be considered as an ensemble of independent nucleons with @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the nuclear one - body density .    with increasing photon energies or decreasing @xmath0 down to @xmath47 , the longitudinal propagation length of diffractively excited hadrons rises and eventually reaches nuclear dimensions .",
