    "critical behavior of disordered systems with quenched disorder has been the subject of much theoretical and experimental interest , because the presence of quenched defects in most real solids modifies their thermodynamic characteristics , including critical behavior .",
    "it is well known that quenched disorder manifests itself by temperature fluctuations in ferro- and antiferromagnetic systems in the absence of external magnetic field or by magnetic field fluctuations in antiferromagnets in uniform magnetic field .    in the former case , quenched disorder",
    "affects the properties of only those homogeneous magnetic materials whose specific heat is divergent at the critical point @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the presence of defects does not change the critical behavior of magnets .",
    "this criterion applies only when the effective hamiltonian near the critical point is isomorphic to the ising model hamiltonian .",
    "disorder - induced critical behavior of the ising model was analyzed in numerous recent studies @xcite .",
    "for dilute ising - like systems , it was found that theoretical calculations are in good agreement with experimental results and monte carlo simulations .    despite extensive theoretical and experimental studies of random - field magnets conducted over the past twenty years @xcite , very few facts concerning their behavior have been established . in particular , the nature of phase transition in the random - field ising model remains unclear , and the currently available theoretical results in this area disagree with experiment .",
    "the only theoretically proved fact is that the upper critical dimension for this phase transition is six ( i.e. , critical phenomena in systems of higher dimension are described by mean field theory ) @xcite , whereas the critical dimension is four for homogeneous systems .",
    "while it had been argued that the lower critical dimension @xmath0 can be both @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite ( i.e. , there is long - range order at finite temperatures if the system s dimension is higher ) , specialists came to the conclusion that @xmath1 after the publication of @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of phase transition in the three - dimensional random - field ising model remains unclear . according to @xcite ,",
    "it is a first - order phase transition even at very low random- field strengths ; according to @xcite , it is a secondorder transition .",
    "the effect of random fields on the behavior of magnetic systems is described by using two qualitatively equivalent models : the ferromagnetic random - field ising model ( rfim ) @xcite and the ising diluted antiferromagnets in a field ( daff ) @xcite .",
    "real random - field magnets are antiferromagnets with quenched nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "their behavior includes manifestations of both antiferromagnetic interaction between nearest neighbor atoms and ferromagnetic interaction between next - nearest neighbor atoms .",
    "the structure of an antiferromagnet can be represented as several interpenetrating ferromagnetic sublattices such that the total magnetization of the antiferromagnet is zero even though each ferromagnetic sublattice is magnetically ordered at a temperature below the neel temperature .",
    "examples of two - sublattice antiferromagnets are the following materials : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . examples of random - field magnets include the uniaxial ising - like antiferromagnets @xmath6 and @xmath7 diluted with zinc atoms in an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in this study , a monte carlo method is used to simulate the thermodynamic behavior of a diluted antiferromagnetic ising model in an applied magnetic field on the simple cubic lattice by taking into account next- nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model has the form    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the spin located at site i ; @xmath10 is the bohr magneton ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 characterize antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor and ferromagnetic nextnearest- neighbor exchange couplings , respectively ; @xmath13 is the strength of the uniform magnetic field ; and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are random variables characterized by the distribution function    @xmath16    which are introduced to describe quenched nonmagnetic impurity atoms vacancies distributed over the lattice and characterized by the concentration @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is spin concentration . for @xmath19 , the model with competing interactions has been studied by monte carlo methods for over twenty years @xcite .",
    "the first study of effects of disorder on critical behavior based on this model was presented in @xcite . for the daff mentioned above @xcite ,",
    "competition between ferromagnetic order parameters was not taken into account .",
    "this model provides the most realistic physical representation .",
    "since the strength of random - field effects is determined by impurity concentration and external field strength both in the model and in real magnets , the parameters of the model can be compared to those of real physical experiments on ising diluted antiferromagnets . however , an analogous comparison of the random field with the impurity concentration in a sample and the applied field strength is difficult to perform for the ferromagnetic random - field ising model ( rfim ) , which is most widely used in numerical simulations .",
    "therefore , random field variation in rfim can not be quantitatively compared with structural disorder in real systems , which is shown here to be the key factor that controls phase transitions .",
    "an antiferromagnet is characterized by the staggered magnetization @xmath20 defined as the difference of the magnetizations of the two sublattices , which plays the role of an order parameter . to determine the type of phase transition , we calculate the binder cumulant @xcite    @xmath21}{[<m_{stg}^2>]^2}).\\ ] ]    where angle and square brackets denote statistical averaging and averaging over disorder realizations .",
    "the calculation of the cumulant is a good test for the order of phase transition : the cumulants plotted versus tempera- ture have a distinct point of intersection in the case of second - order transition , whereas those corresponding to first - order phase transition have a characteristic shape and do not intersect .",
    "we also examine spin - glass states .",
    "it is well known that spin glasses are characterized by transition to a phase with an infinite number of metastable states separated by potential barriers in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",

    ", both statistical averaging and averaging over disorder realizations must be performed only after the system has thermalized .",
    "critical behavior of disordered systems is characterized by anomalously long relaxation times , which rapidly increase with the size of the simulated system . to reach equilibrium at near - critical temperatures and determine the corresponding thermodynamic characteristics ,",
    "the system was quenched with a temperature step of @xmath25 starting from a temperature at which no metastable states had been obtained in any sweep .",
    "at each temperature step , a relaxation regime was computed in @xmath26 steps and averaging was performed in @xmath27 steps by using the spin configuration obtained at the preceding step as an initial condition .",
    "this procedure was executed to obtain a stable equilibrium at each temperature and avoid metastable states @xcite .    for each lattice size @xmath28 ,",
    "thermodynamic characteristics were computed for constant @xmath13 and @xmath18 by ensembleaveraging the results of five sweeps executed for different initial spin configurations corresponding to a particular disorder realization and then averaging over @xmath29 to @xmath30 different disorder realizations .",
