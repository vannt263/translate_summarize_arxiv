    "perturbative qcd predicts a sharp rise in the number of gluons per unit area and rapidity in a proton / nucleus at high energy ( small @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "this however would lead to violation of unitarity of hadronic cross sections at high energies .",
    "high gluon density and gluon recombination effects @xcite are believed to be responsible for taming this growth and restoration of unitarity .",
    "it has been suggested that gluons at small @xmath0 can be described by a strong classical field @xcite and that weak coupling , semi - classical methods can be applied to describe the physics of dense gluonic systems , such as a proton or nucleus at high energies .",
    "this dense system of gluons ( the color glass condensate ) is characterized by a saturation momentum @xmath1 which grows fast with energy and rapidity .",
    "there has been much work done in order to investigate the properties of the color glass condensate in dis electron - proton and electron - nucleus , as well as proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "while the saturation effects in protons at current energies are far from being established @xcite , the situation in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions is more intriguing .",
    "the saturation model seems to work reasonably well at rhic @xcite even though there are a lot of open questions which need to be addressed before one can claim that the saturation model describes high energy heavy ion collisions at rhic quantitatively .",
    "the role of final state interactions , thermalization , etc . is still to be understood @xcite .    in a recent set of publications @xcite",
    ", we proposed that high energy proton - nucleus collisions at forward rapidities at rhic may be an ideal place in order to investigate the color glass condensate and the saturation model . by considering proton - nucleus collisions in the forward rapidity region",
    ", one can avoid most , if not all , of the complications present in a nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "previously , we calculated ( real ) photon production rate in @xmath2 collisions @xcite and showed that it is very sensitive to saturation effects in the nucleus .    in this work ,",
    "we consider dilepton ( virtual photon ) production in @xmath2 and show that dileptons provide a more versatile probe of the saturation model than photons .",
    "furthermore , photons are notoriously difficult to measure in a collider environment .",
    "one needs to define isolation criteria in order to separate photons from different sources which greatly reduces the production rates in addition to introducing theoretical ambiguities in defining the isolation criteria .",
    "the use of factorization theorems , well established for high @xmath3 _ inclusive _ photon production , may be questionable for isolated photons . by considering dilepton production , one can avoid most of these experimental and theoretical difficulties @xcite .",
    "we briefly review our formalism and the differences between real and virtual photon cross sections in section @xmath4 . in section @xmath5",
    ", we consider the diffractive cross section and show that it vanishes .",
    "we consider the inclusive cross section in section @xmath6 and derive the differential cross section for dilepton production in @xmath2 collisions @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the dilepton invariant mass and transverse momentum while @xmath10 is its fractional energy .",
    "we end by discussing our results and the experimental signatures of saturation effects .",
    "in order to reuse some parts of the calculation we already performed for real photon production @xcite , we start by a section highlighting the main differences between real photon and lepton pair production , as well as the common aspects .",
    "we want to calculate the amplitude for the elementary process @xmath11 where a quark entering in the color field of a nucleus emits a lepton pair @xmath12 . in terms of _",
    "in- _ and _ out- _ states , this amplitude reads : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the creation operator for a quark , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively create a lepton and an anti - lepton . applying the lsz reduction formula to this amplitude @xcite , one obtains the following expression in terms of the fermionic fields : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the quark field , @xmath19 the leptonic field , @xmath20 a quark free spinor , @xmath21 a lepton free spinor and @xmath22 an anti - lepton free spinor .",
    "note that we have approximated all the renormalization constants by @xmath23 since we are going to compute only the lowest order in the couplings @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "therefor this amplitude is made of a quark line and a leptonic line , connected by photons .",
    "the quark line interacts with the background color which is used to describe the high energy nucleus . at lowest order in the electro - magnetic and strong coupling constants ,",
    "only one bare photon connects the two fermionic lines , as illustrated in figure ( [ process ] ) .    the part of the diagram that describes the scattering of the quark in the color field of the nucleus is identical to what we have already calculated for the case of photon production .",
    "namely , the photon can be attached before or after the scatterings , but the terms where the photon is attached between scatterings of the quark on the nucleus are suppressed by inverse powers of the center of mass energy @xmath26 . therefore , compared to the photon production case , we need only to replace the photon polarization vectors of the produced photon by the propagator of the ( now virtual ) photon , its coupling to the leptonic line and the spinors of the @xmath12 pair .",
    "this amounts to the following substitution prescription for the photon propagator , but it is in fact irrelevant here since the photon must have an invariant mass squared @xmath27 larger than @xmath28 because of the threshold for the production of a pair of leptons with mass @xmath29 . ] @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the 4-momentum of the virtual photon , and where @xmath32 is the discontinuity of the one - loop leptonic contribution to the photon polarization tensor ( i.e. the loop on the upper part of the diagram of figure [ process ] - only its discontinuity is needed since the leptons are produced on - shell ) .",
    "an important simplification we used in the photon case was that the sum over the photon polarizations turned the product @xmath33 into @xmath34 ( up to terms proportional to @xmath35 that do not contribute thanks to ward identities ) .",
    "this property led to a dramatic simplification of the dirac algebra involved in the calculation of the photon production cross - section . a priori , the object @xmath36 is not proportional to @xmath37 , which means that the _ fully differential _",
    "lepton pair production cross - section has a more complicated lorenz structure .",
    "if however we assume that one reconstructs the virtual photon 4-momentum from the momenta @xmath38 of the components of the lepton pair , the same simplification occurs .",
    "indeed , if one integrates over the lepton momentum inside the leptonic tensor @xmath39 , keeping the sum @xmath40 fixed , we obtain the following result : @xmath41 therefore , for the cross - section @xmath42 , we have the same simplification as in the photon production case .    the relation between the differential cross - section and the amplitude can therefore be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the amplitude for the production of a virtual photon , amputated of its external legs , and from which the factor @xmath45 has been removed . explicitly , we have : @xmath46u({\\imb p})\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\times\\int d^2{\\imb x}_\\perp e^{i({\\imb q}_\\perp+{\\imb k}_\\perp-{\\imb p}_\\perp)\\cdot{\\imb x}_\\perp } \\big(u({\\imb x}_\\perp)-1\\big)\\ ; , \\label{eq : finalamp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the electrical charge of the quark and where @xmath48 is a matrix in the fundamental representation of @xmath49 that represents the interactions of the quark with the classical color field of the nucleus : @xmath50 with @xmath51 in the fundamental representation , and where @xmath52 is the density of color sources in the nucleus .",
    "the color averages over the distribution of hard color sources in the nucleus are identical to the case of photon production , and can be found in section 3 of @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath53 in the cross - section differs from the factor we denoted @xmath54 in our calculation of photon production only in the fact that we must not assume @xmath55 in the calculation .",
    "in fact , in this quantity , only the factor @xmath56 that contains the dirac algebra is affected by this change .",
    "its new value is now : @xmath57\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 8(p^-{}^2+q^-{}^2)\\left [ { { 2p\\cdot q}\\over{d_p d_q } } -{1\\over{d_p}}-{1\\over{d_q } } \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 8k^2\\left [ { { p^-{}^2}\\over{d_q^2 } } + { { q^-{}^2}\\over{d_p^2 } } + { { ( p^-+q^-)^2}\\over{d_p d_q } } \\right]\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the mass of the quark and where we denote @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "it is trivial to check that it reduces to the value found in @xcite if we set @xmath55 .",
    "having in mind the fact that the quark comes from the wave - function of a proton , we neglect the mass of the quark in the following .",
    "like in @xcite , we can first study the case of diffractive dilepton production , as the kinematics is simpler .",
    "let us just remember that the diffractive cross - section is obtained by performing the average over the distribution of nuclear color sources before squaring the amplitude .",
    "this implies that no net transverse momentum is exchanged between the nucleus and the quark , i.e. @xmath61 . if one evaluates the factor @xmath62 with this kinematical constraint , one obtains a vanishing result if we neglect the mass @xmath58 of the quark : @xmath63 this is in fact similar to the case of real photon production : the absence of transverse momentum exchange between the quark and the nucleus prevents the emission of the virtual photon .",
    "if we do not require a diffractive process on the nuclear side , we just have to perform the average over colors sources after squaring the amplitude .",
    "the details of this procedure are given in section 6 of @xcite .",
    "we obtain the following expression for the differential cross - section : @xmath64 where we define again @xmath65 like in the case of real photon production , all the information about the nature of the medium crossed by the quark ( in particular , all the dependence on the saturation scale @xmath66 ) is contained in this function @xmath67 .    at this point",
    ", it is useful to introduce the longitudinal momentum fraction of the virtual photon @xmath68 , as well as the total transverse momentum transfer between the nucleus and the quark @xmath69 .",
    "the phase space @xmath70 of the lepton pair can be rewritten as @xmath71 , while the phase space of the outgoing quark can be written as @xmath72 ( implicitly , @xmath73 ) . in terms of these new variables ,",
    "the inclusive differential cross - section reads ( for unit electric charge of quark ) @xmath74 { { z^2{\\imb l}_\\perp^2}\\over{[{\\imb k}_\\perp^2+m^2(1-z ) ] [ ( { \\imb k}_\\perp - z{\\imb l}_\\perp)^2+m^2(1-z)]}}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\left . -",
    "z(1-z)\\,m^2\\left[{1\\over{[{\\imb k}_\\perp^2+m^2(1-z)]}}-{1\\over{[({\\imb k}_\\perp - z{\\imb l}_\\perp)^2+m^2(1-z)]}}\\right]^2 \\right\\}\\ ; .\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\label{eq : main}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is our main result .",
    "it gives the differential cross section for inclusive production of dileptons in high energy quark - nucleus collisions and includes all the high gluon density effects in the nucleus .",
    "all the information about the high gluon density effects in the nucleus is contained in the function @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "this function behaves as @xmath76 in the @xmath77 ( perturbative ) region and like @xmath78 at @xmath79 . for @xmath80",
    ", it is almost flat .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath81 where the slope of the cross section changes strongly depends on rapidity .",
    "this slow down happens at higher values of @xmath81 in the forward rapidity region .",
    "this expression reduces to the one found in @xcite for real photon production if we take the limit @xmath82 as it must .",
    "the main difference compared to the production of a real photon is the fact that the collinear singularities at @xmath83 and @xmath84 are now screened by the invariant mass squared of the lepton pair , via the term @xmath85 .    in order to relate ( [ eq : main ] ) to proton - nucleus collisions",
    ", we will need to convolute ( [ eq : main ] ) with the quark distribution function in a proton using collinear factorization theorem .",
    "explicitly , @xmath86 furthermore , one will need to convolute the above cross section with a quark / hadron or quark / jet fragmentation function if one is interested in measuring both the outgoing hadron / jet as well as the dilepton .",
    "otherwise , one can do the @xmath87 integration above to get the @xmath88 differential cross section .",
    "experimentally , one will be able to study @xmath8 , @xmath89 and rapidity ( @xmath10 ) dependence of the dilepton production cross section in @xmath2 collisions at rhic in the near future . here",
    ", we outline our qualitative predictions from the color glass condensate picture of a nucleus at high energy which will be straightforward to verify / falsify at rhic .",
    "first , as compared to the standard leading twist perturbative qcd , we expect that the partonic level cross section @xmath90 will change its behavior from @xmath91 to @xmath92 for @xmath93 and an even flatter behavior at smaller @xmath94 , at fixed rapidity . convoluting the partonic cross section with parton structure functions in order to get the proton - nucleus cross section will change the power of @xmath94 .",
    "nevertheless , we expect the difference in the power of @xmath94 to be observable even after the convolution @xcite .",
    "second , the change of the slope of the cross section from @xmath91 to @xmath92 will happen at a higher transverse momentum in the forward rapidity region than the mid - rapidity region .",
    "indeed , the saturation scale of the nucleus near the fragmentation region of the proton is much larger than the value @xmath95gev@xmath96 usually quoted at mid - rapidity @xcite .",
    "the growth of the saturation scale with energy is known from dis experiments at hera @xcite and heavy ion collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "for the same reason as above , transverse momentum broadening of the jet+dilepton system will depend on its rapidity : it will be larger at forward rapidities .",
    "this broadening proportional to @xmath66 adds up to the broadening due to initial `` intrinsic transverse momentum '' of the incoming quark .",
    "this effect has been neglected in our final result by setting @xmath97 .",
    "all it would take to keep both effects simultaneously would be to keep @xmath98 in the calculation .",
    "a more quantitative investigation of our results is beyond the scope of this work and will be pursued elsewhere .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to point out that inclusion of the standard leading order pqcd diagrams @xcite such as dilepton production via quark - anti - quark annihilation and therefore is higher order ] and from direct ( virtual ) photon diagrams will be required for numerical accuracy .",
    "since these diagrams are not effected by the strong classical field of the nucleus and do not interfere with the diagrams considered in this work , one can just add their contribution to our results .",
    "this way , one will have the full lo [ @xmath99 and nlo [ @xmath100 dilepton production cross section in @xmath2 including the high gluon density effects in the nucleus @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our result ( [ eq : main ] ) can also be used for heavy ion collisions in the very forward rapidity region where valence quarks are the dominant partons in the projectile nucleus .",
    "the only difference with @xmath2 is that one would then need to convolute our cross section with the quark distribution function in a nucleus rather than a proton .",
    "this may make it possible to extract the shadowing function for quarks ( at large @xmath0 ) in the projectile nucleus by considering the ratio of dilepton cross sections in @xmath101 and @xmath2 collisions at rhic or lhc .",
