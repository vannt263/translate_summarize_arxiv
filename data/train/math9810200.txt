    "the deformation space of a kleinian group @xmath0 is the space of faithful discrete representations of @xmath0 into @xmath1 preserving parabolicity modulo conjugacy .",
    "it is one of the important aspects of kleinian group theory to study the structures of deformation spaces .",
    "the first thing that was studied among the structures of deformation spaces was that of subspaces called quasi - conformal deformation spaces . by works of ahlfors , bers ,",
    "kra , marden and sullivan among others , the topological types and the parametrization of quasi - conformal deformation spaces are completely determined using the theory of quasi - conformal mappings and the ergodic theory on the sphere ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the total deformation spaces are less understood .",
    "a recent work of minsky @xcite makes it possible to determine the topological structure of the total deformation space completely in the case of once - puncture torus groups .",
    "the other cases are far from complete understanding .",
    "although very rough topological structures , for instance the connected components of deformation spaces can be understood by virtue of recent works of anderson  canary and anderson  canary  mccullough , more detailed structures like the frontier of quasi - conformal deformation spaces are not yet known even in the case of surface groups with genus greater than @xmath2 .    a first step to understand the topological structure of the deformation space of a kleinian group @xmath0 is to give a criterion for a sequence @xmath3 in the deformation space to converge or diverge . in this paper , we shall consider the simplest case when the group @xmath0 is isomorphic to a hyperbolic surface group @xmath4 and has no accidental parabolic elements . in this case , @xmath5 is either quasi - fuchsian or a totally degenerate b  group , or a totally doubly degenerate group .",
    "hence by taking a subsequence , we have only to consider the following three cases : all of the @xmath3 are quasi - fuchsian , or totally degenerate b  groups , or totally doubly degenerate groups . for such groups ,",
    "some conditions for sequences to converge are given for example in bers  @xcite , thurston  @xcite and ohshika  @xcite .",
    "thurston s convergence theorem is called the double limit theorem .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a sufficient condition for sequences to diverge in the deformation space , which is in some sense complementary to the condition of the double limit theorem .    before explaining the content of our main theorem ,",
    "let us recall that a kleinian group isomorphic to a hyperbolic surface group without accidental parabolic elements has two pieces of information describing the structures near ends as follows .",
    "when such a kleinian group @xmath0 is quasi - fuchsian , by the ahlfors  bers theory , we get a pair of points in the teichmuller space @xmath6 corresponding to the group . in the case when @xmath0 is a totally degenerate b  group , as there is one end of the non - cuspidal part @xmath7 which is geometrically finite , we have a point in the teichmller space . in addition , the geometrically infinite end of @xmath7 determines an ending lamination which is defined uniquely up to changes of transverse measures . finally in the case when @xmath0 is a totally doubly degenerate group , @xmath7 have two geometrically infinite ends , and we have a pair of measured laminations which are ending laminations of the two ends .",
    "we shall define an end invariant of such a group @xmath0 to be a pair @xmath8 where each factor is either a point of the teichmller space or a projective lamination represented by an ending lamination , which gives the information on one of the ends .",
    "the statement of our main theorem is as follows .",
    "suppose that we are given a sequence of kleinian groups @xmath9 in the parabolicity - preserving deformation space @xmath10 of kleinian groups isomorphic to @xmath4 for a hyperbolic surface @xmath11 .",
    "suppose moreover that the end invariants @xmath12 have the following property : either in the thurston compactification or in the projective lamination space , @xmath13 and @xmath14 converge to maximal and connected projective laminations with the same support .",
    "then the sequence @xmath15 does not converge in @xmath10 .    to understand the meaning of this theorem ,",
    "let us contrast it with thurston s double limit theorem . for simplicity , we only consider the case when @xmath5 is a quasi - fuchsian group for the time being . by ahlfors ",
    "bers theory , a sequence of quasi - fuchsian groups @xmath16 corresponds to a sequence of pairs of marked hyperbolic structures @xmath17 on @xmath11 .",
    "consider the case when both @xmath18 and @xmath19 diverge in the teichmller space and their limits in the thurston compactification are projective laminations @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] respectively .",
    "the double limit theorem asserts that if @xmath22 and @xmath23 fill up @xmath11 , viz .",
    ", any measured lamination has non - zero intersection number with either @xmath22 or @xmath23 , then the sequence @xmath15 converges in the deformation space passing through a subsequence if necessary .",
    "the situation of our theorem is at the opposite pole to that of the double limit theorem .",
    "we assume in our theorem that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are equal except for the transverse measures and that they are maximal and connected .",
    "we can see the assumption of maximality is essential by taking look at an example of anderson ",
    "canary @xcite .",
    "they constructed an example of quasi - fuchsian groups converging in @xmath10 which correspond to pairs of marked hyperbolic structures @xmath24 such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 converge to the same point in @xmath27 . in this example , the support of the limit projective lamination is a simple closed curve , far from being maximal .",
    "the proof of our theorem is based on an argument sketched in thurston @xcite which was used to prove his theorem stating that sequences of kleinian groups isomorphic to surface groups which converge algebraically to kleinian groups without accidental parabolic elements converge strongly .",
    "we shall give a detailed proof of this theorem in the last section as an application of our theorem .",

    "since @xmath612 is constant with respect to @xmath613 , the component @xmath609 must be isotopic to @xmath614 fixing @xmath615 .",
    "this implies that there exists a component @xmath616 of @xmath617 such that @xmath618 is homotopic in @xmath68 to @xmath619 on @xmath263 .",
    "hence by letting @xmath608 be @xmath579 , we get a surface as we wanted .",
    "next suppose that @xmath11 is a once - punctured torus .",
    "the only case to which the argument above can not be applied is one when @xmath188 is a once - punctured open annulus and @xmath455 is contained in @xmath620 . by isotoping @xmath263",

    "consider a geometric limit @xmath635 of the sequence of pleated surfaces @xmath636 constructed above .",

    "note that we can apply the same argument as lemma [ far surface ] , and prove that @xmath637 does not meet the frontier of @xmath256 .",
    "now since @xmath639 is homotopic to a cusp component of @xmath464 which can be reached from @xmath256 , it is homotopic to the image of a cusp of @xmath11 by @xmath467 . by pulling back a homotopy by an approximate isometry",
