    "clarifying the origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) is one of the most important unsolved problems in modern astrophysics  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is generally thought that cosmic rays with energies greater than 10@xmath1  ev ( 1  eev ) are of extragalactic origin because the galactic magnetic fields are not strong enough to confine them .",
    "indeed , no apparent anisotropy in arrival directions of uhecrs along the galactic plane has been found . on the other hand ,",
    "a steepening in the energy spectrum of uhecrs at around 50  eev is observed by the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) experiment and the telescope array ( ta ) experiment  @xcite , and also by the pierre auger observatory in a similar energy region  @xcite .",
    "this can be explained as a consequence of the cosmic ray energy losses due to interactions with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , as predicted by  @xcite , and  @xcite . in this case",
    ", we expect that most of the observed cosmic rays of the highest energies originate from sources within the gzk horizon ( @xmath2100  mpc ) , and a correlation between nearby objects and arrival directions of cosmic rays is expected .",
    "the uhecrs are deflected by the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields on their way to earth .",
    "the deflection angles are determined by the particle charges , source distances , and strength of the magnetic fields .",
    "for example , in case of a proton arriving from a 100  mpc distance through a random extragalactic magnetic field 1  ng and correlation length of @xmath21  mpc , the expected deflection angle is @xmath3 for 100  eev ( and less than @xmath4 for 40  eev ) using the existing magnetic field estimates @xcite .",
    "the ta experiment observes uhecrs in the northern hemisphere using a surface detector ( sd ) array  @xcite of @xmath2 700  km@xmath5 area located in millard county , utah , usa ( 39.3@xmath6  n , 112.9@xmath6  w ) .",
    "three fluorescence detector ( fd ) stations  @xcite surround the sd array  @xcite and view the atmosphere above it .",
    "the sd array consists of 507 sds installed on a square grid with 1.2  km spacing , and measures particles from extensive air showers ( eass ) at ground level .",
    "the energy and the arrival direction of a primary particle are determined from observed energy deposits as a function of distance from the shower core in the sds and the arrival time distribution of the eas particles .",
    "the test operation of the sd array began in march 2008 , and the full sd array has been operational with a uniform trigger criteria from may 11 , 2008 .",
    "the present analysis uses only the events detected by the sd array because this data set has the greatest statistics than that by the fds .",
    "assuming the sources have the same intrinsic uhecr luminosities , the arrival directions of higher energy cosmic rays from nearby sources are expected to correlate better with the source positions .",
    "we search for the correlations between the ta events and objects in catalogs by changing three parameters : the minimum energy of the cosmic ray events , @xmath7 , the separation angle , @xmath8 , between the cosmic ray arrival direction and the object , and the maximum redshift , @xmath9 , of the objects .",
    "a similar approach has been taken in the analyses by the pierre auger observatory  @xcite and by the hires experiment  @xcite using the vcv catalog of 12th edition  @xcite .",
    "as putative sources of uhecr , we examine the objects in the 13th edition of the vcv catalog  @xcite .",
    "this catalog is a compilation of several surveys made under different conditions such as field of views ( fovs ) , observation periods , etc .",
    "it does not represent a homogeneous sample of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and its degree of completeness is unknown  @xcite . in addition , we have investigated unbiased data sets from different measurements , namely , radio : the third cambridge catalog of radio sources catalog ( 3crr )  @xcite , infrared : the 2mass ( the two micron all - sky survey ) redshift survey catalog ( 2mrs )  @xcite , x - ray : swift bat ( burst alert telescope ) 58-month hard x - ray survey catalog ( sb-58 m )  @xcite and 60-month agn survey catalog ( sb - agn )  @xcite , and gamma - ray : 2nd fermi large area telescope agn catalog ( 2lac )  @xcite . in each catalog , we select only those objects that have redshift information . in the case of the 2lac catalog ,",
    "this criterion reduces the number of objects by @xmath250% .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the observation status of the sd array and qualities of reconstructed events are briefly described in section  [ sd_data ] .",
    "the details of the parameter scanning in the correlation searches using the object catalogs are given in section  [ correlation ] , and the results are described in section  [ results ] .",
    "we also investigated penalties for the multi - catalog scanning in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the conclusions from this analysis are in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this work we use the sd air shower events observed in the first 40-month run of ta from may 2008 through september 2011 .",
    "these events are triggered by a three - fold coincidence of adjacent sds within @xmath10s @xcite .",
    "the details of sd event reconstruction are described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "first , the shower geometry including the arrival direction is obtained using the time differences between the observed signals at each sd .",
    "next , the precise shower geometry and the lateral distribution of shower particles are determined using the observed energy deposit in each sd .",
    "finally , the primary energy is determined from the lateral distribution .",
    "the overall energy scale of the sd events is fixed by calibration with the fd energy scale using a hybrid event set as described in the reference  @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in energy determination is @xmath11 .",
    "the data quality cuts for the reconstructed events are the same as in the previous ta analysis papers  @xcite .",
    "the events are cut if the zenith angle is greater than 45@xmath6 and/or the core position is within 1200  m of the sd array boundary .",
    "the eas reconstruction efficiency under these criteria is greater than 98% including the duty cycle of the sd array for @xmath12  eev  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy in arrival direction determination is @xmath13 and the energy resolution is better than 20% in this energy range .",
    "the number of events remaining after reconstruction and quality cuts is 988 for @xmath1410  eev , 57 for @xmath1440  eev , and 3 for @xmath15  eev . from our monte - carlo studies including the full detector response simulations , we confirmed that the acceptance of the sd array is fully geometrical , i.e. , independent of the arrival direction up to @xmath16 for showers with energies greater than 10  eev  @xcite .",
    "we also confirmed that the arrival direction distribution of the observed events in the horizontal coordinates and the equatorial coordinates are consistent with large scale isotropy shown in figure  [ zenazi ] . in this analysis",
    ", we use the geometrical acceptance to generate random events for reasons of computational efficiency .",
    "the total exposure of the sd array in the first 40 months of operation is @xmath17 including the quality cuts .",
    "we use the catalogs of extragalactic objects resulting from measurements as listed in table  [ catalog_table ] . in several catalogs ,",
    "the objects near the galactic plane are excluded to avoid incompleteness from the experimental limitation by the authors of each catalog .",
    "we also exclude the observed sd events in the corresponding regions .",
    "the target objects and the cut criteria in the each catalog are summarized below .",
    "these criteria ( e.g. significance level ) were chosen by the authors of the each catalog .",
    "the 3crr catalog contains radio galaxies detected at 178  mhz with fluxes greater than 10  jy  @xcite .",
    "objects in the direction of the galactic disk ( @xmath18 ) were not included .",
    "the 2mrs  @xcite catalog is derived from the 2mass observation with detection range between @xmath19 m and k@xmath20 magnitude .",
    "this catalog also loses completeness near the galactic plane , so the authors of the catalog excluded regions with @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 otherwise .",
    "the sb-58 m catalog consists of objects which were detected with a significance greater than @xmath24 in the energy range of @xmath25  kev in the first 58 months of observation by swift bat .",
    "we select the extragalactic objects in this catalog for this work .",
    "the catalog of sb - agn contains agns with at least @xmath26 significance in the energy range of @xmath27  kev in the first 60 months of observation by swift bat .",
    "the 2lac  @xcite data set consists of agns detected with at least @xmath28 significance in the energy range of 100  mev@xmath29100  gev in the first 24 months of observation by fermi - lat .",
    "the region of the galactic disk @xmath3010@xmath6 is cut away .",
    "we also examine the vcv catalog which is a compilation of several agn surveys .",
    "the number of objects and the sd events after the cuts applied in each case are given in table  [ arrivaldirection_cut ] .",
    "for a given set of parameters @xmath31 , there are @xmath32 events with energies @xmath33 .",
    "we can count the number of events , @xmath34 , out of @xmath32 which are correlated with objects in a catalog with redshifts @xmath35 and within the angular separation @xmath8 .",
    "we can calculate the chance probability , @xmath36 , that @xmath34 or more correlated events are found from an isotropic uhecr flux under the same conditions .",
    "we carry out a parameter scan in @xmath31 space to find the set of parameters which maximizes the correlation between the ta events and the catalog objects , i.e. , minimizes @xmath36 . to determine the probability , @xmath36 ,",
    "we first obtain the probability , @xmath37 , that a random event is correlated with at least one object by chance for a given @xmath38 .",
    "we generate 10@xmath39 random events to obtain the probability , @xmath37 , in the same experimental region of the each catalog",
    ".    then @xmath36 can be obtained as a cumulative binomial probability : @xmath40    the scan over parameters was performed as follows .",
    "the value of @xmath7 is set by the energy of the @xmath32-th highest energy event .",
    "we scan over all values of @xmath32 such that @xmath7 is greater than 40  eev .",
    "note that this energy is less than the energy ( 50  eev ) at which the ta energy spectrum begins to fall off steeply  @xcite .",
    "we set the upper boundary of the parameter @xmath9 as 0.03 , which corresponds to the distances smaller than 120  mpc .",
    "this is comparable to the gzk horizon .",
    "the selected step size of @xmath9 is @xmath41 , which is the typical accuracy in the redshift measurements .",
    "the separation angle , @xmath8 , is varied from @xmath42 to @xmath4 .",
    "the maximum search window of @xmath43 is selected as appropriate for lower energy events ( @xmath240  eev ) arriving from the distance of 100  mpc . the selected step size in @xmath8",
    "is chosen as @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath42 for @xmath46 .",
    "the parameter ranges and step sizes are summarized in table  [ parameter_table ] .",
    "the minimum @xmath36 obtained from this procedure does not represent the correlation probability directly , because the parameter scanning enhances the correlation probability artificially  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a penalty for parameter scanning should be evaluated and the true probability of correlation must include this penalty .",
    "this will be described in section  [ results ] .",
    "the results of the parameter scan are listed in table  [ chanceprobability ] .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath47 among all the catalogs is 1.3@xmath48 found in the sb - agn catalog with the best parameters @xmath49 . a sky map of the ta events and the objects under the condition @xmath50 which gives the smallest @xmath47 is shown in figure  [ swiftbatagn ] .",
    "all the observed uhecrs with @xmath33 correlate with at least one object with @xmath35 in the sb - agn catalog .",
    "figure  [ a2 ] , and  [ a3 ] show the probability as a function of each parameter @xmath50 while fixing the values of the other two at the optimum value for this data comparison .",
    "now let us consider the penalty for the parameter scanning .",
    "we evaluate the probability , @xmath51 , of finding a correlation by chance with @xmath52 smaller than that obtained from the data as follows  ( for a more detailed description of the penalty calculation see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we generate 10@xmath39 random sets of @xmath32 `` cosmic ray events '' , where @xmath32 is the same as the number of the observed events with energies greater than @xmath53  eev . for each of the mock event sets ,",
    "the parameter scanning was carried out using exactly same method as for the observed data set , and @xmath52 was calculated .",
    "note that the parameters @xmath50 which yield @xmath52 are different for each of the 10@xmath39 trials .",
    "the distribution of @xmath52 in case of the sb - agn catalog is shown in figure  [ b1 ] together with @xmath47 .",
    "one can see that rather small values @xmath54 can happen even though the simulated uhecr distribution is isotropic .",
    "if we repeat the same experiment and the parameter scanning many times , the value of our result @xmath55 could be just a chance occurrence .",
    "the probability including the penalty for the parameter scanning ( pps ) is evaluated as @xmath56 for the sb - agn catalog , and the values for all the catalogs are listed in table  [ chanceprobability ] .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath51 among the catalogs is @xmath57 from the the sb - agn catalog .",
    "this does not yet include the penalty for searching in several catalogs .",
    "if we have several catalogs , regardless of whether they are independent or partially overlapping , there is a possibility of finding a catalog which gives the same or smaller @xmath47 value by chance , even though there are no correlations between the events and the objects .",
    "the straightforward way to calculate the penalty factor associated with the partially overlapping catalogs , as is the case in our analysis , is to include all the catalogs in the monte - carlo simulation .",
    "therefore , we have repeated the simulation with 10@xmath39 mock sets as described above , but with the scanning performed in all six catalogs . calculating the fraction of mock sets that show equal or better correlation than the data , we find that the final probability with a penalty of parameter scanning ( pps ) and a penalty of multi - catalog scanning ( pcs ) @xmath58 . therefore , we conclude that no significant correlation between uhecrs and the astronomical objects is found in the current ta data set .",
    "first , we consider the effect of finite resolution in the scanning parameters .",
    "the uncertainty in determination of the arrival directions and energy only make correlations worse due to direction smearing and the contamination of the lower energy events than @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the obtained @xmath47 already includes these resolution effects . the same concerns the uncertainty in the redshifts of the catalog objects .",
    "consider now the effect of the systematic uncertainty in energy determination . as mentioned above , this uncertainty is @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the present analysis with the parameter scanning is independent of absolute energy scale : the _ energies _ of the events are no more than keys for event sorting , and a systematic energy shift does not affect the scanning in @xmath7 , hence the number of events involved in the correlation with the objects and the probability @xmath47 .",
    "the last issue to discuss is the incompleteness of the catalogs , which remains even after we cut out the regions around the galactic plane .",
    "the objects in the vcv catalog are inhomogeneous because it is a mere compilation of objects detected under different conditions .",
    "the completeness of the other catalogs , in particular the 2lac , could be affected by our cuts , particularly by the selection of objects with the known redshift .",
    "while the incompleteness may make the _ interpretation _ of correlations ambiguous if they are present , it does not affect the calculation of @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , the effect of the incompleteness cancels out in @xmath47 since the same set of objects is used to cross - correlate with the data and each mock event set .",
    "therefore , the incompleteness of the catalogs can not produce spurious correlations ( although it may , in principle , be responsible for their absence ) .",
    "so far we have treated the objects in each catalog equally regardless of their class .",
    "now let us examine whether there is a specific type of object that has stronger correlations with uhecrs than others .",
    "we will consider the case of the sb - agn catalog which shows strongest correlations with uhecrs .",
    "first , we count the number of objects of each class in the ta fov with redshifts smaller than 0.02 .",
    "some of the objects are labeled  unclassified \" in the catalog . for these we used the information from other surveys  @xcite .",
    "the fractions of seyfert 2 , 1 , 1.5 , 1.9 and liner galaxies in the sb - agn catalog satisfying the above conditions are 0.441 , 0.235 , 0.132 , 0.044 , and 0.044 , respectively ( the total fraction of other class agns : 0.044 , and the fraction of the unclassified agn : 0.059 ) .",
    "the total number of agns which are correlated with uhecrs is 22 with the parameters in table  [ chanceprobability ] ( note that the number of uhecr events and that of agns are not the same because some of the events fall within the given angular distance from several sources ) . among these 22 agns the fractions of seyfert 2 , 1 , 1.5 , 1.9 , liner , and unclassified galaxies are 0.455 , 0.182 , 0.227 , 0.045 , 0.045 , and 0.045 , respectively .",
    "we see that the largest difference is for the seyfert 1.5 galaxies .",
    "the probability , @xmath36 , of finding 5 or more correlated seyfert 1.5 galaxies out of 22 by chance can be evaluated by the cumulative binomial probability with an expectation of 0.13 , and is @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , no significant correlation with a specific type of agn in the sb - agn catalog is found .",
    "[ conclusion ]    we examine the correlations between the observed uhecr arrival directions and the extragalactic objects from the different survey catalogs under assumption that the sources have the same intrinsic uhecr luminosities .",
    "we use the ta - sd events with energies greater than 40  eev obtained in the first 40 months of observation .",
    "we search for maximum correlations by scanning over three parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 in six different catalogs .",
    "the smallest chance probability among these six catalogs was found with the swift bat ( 60-month ) agn catalog , @xmath60 .",
    "this probability increases to @xmath61 when we include the penalty for the three - parameter scanning in the swift bat catalog alone , and to @xmath58 when scanning in all the catalogs is taken into account .",
    "therefore , we conclude that no significant correlation with the considered catalogs of extragalactic objects is found in the present ta data set . investigating specifically the case of the swift bat ( 60-month ) agn catalog which gives the strongest correlation , we find that no particular subclass of objects is responsible for this correlation .",
