    "<S> we study the rare decays @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the r - parity violating supersymmetric standard model . from the latest upper limits of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we have derived new upper bounds on the relevant r - parity violating couplings products , which are stronger than the existing ones . using the constrained parameter space </S>",
    "<S> , we present the r - parity violating effects on the branching ratios and the forward - backward asymmetries of these decays . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath5 and @xmath6 could be enhanced several orders by the r - parity violating sneutrino and squark exchanges , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the r - parity violating effects on the dilepton invariant mass spectra of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and the normalized forward - backward asymmetry @xmath9 and @xmath10 are studied in detail . </S>",
