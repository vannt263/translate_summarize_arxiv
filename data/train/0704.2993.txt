    "the knowledge of how clouds are structured ( e.g. the distribution of mass , size and column density of clumps within clouds ) can be used to obtain constraints about how clouds fragment and will eventually lead to a better understanding of the initial mass function ( e.g. padoan , nordlund , & jones @xcite ) .",
    "the mapping of the dust distribution in giant molecular clouds or entire cloud complexes becomes increasingly achievable due to the availability of all sky near infrared surveys such as 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",

    "basic techniques to map the column density of dust , i.e. extinction , are : 1 ) star counting ( e.g. wolf @xcite , bok @xcite , froebrich et al . ) ; 2 ) colour excess ( e.g. lada et al .",

    "on the other hand , using colour excess methods to determine extinction requires the knowledge of the reddening law , which might vary with position and/or column density ( e.g. froebrich & del burgo @xcite ) . in this paper",

    "additionally , a number of more distant cloud complexes ( e.g. cassiopeia , camelopardalis , auriga , monoceros ) are found in the same part of the sky .",

    "foreground stars lead to on average bluer colours , hence the extinction is underestimated .",
    "young stars are intrinsically red and hence lead to an overestimate of the extinction . due to the large range of distances of the clouds in our map ( ranging from 140pc to at least 1kpc )",
    "the removal of foreground stars is very difficult . in principle",
    "the number of foreground stars has to be evaluated for each individual cloud and removed statistically .",
    "the large number of clouds in the map with partly unknown distances , or overlapping clouds close to the galactic plane makes this an almost impossible task",

    "these gradients are caused by a change of the stellar population with distance from the galactic plane .",
    "in particular , the median colour of stars becomes bluer at lower galactic latitudes and ( less prominent ) redder towards galactic longitudes approaching the anticenter of the galaxy . to determine the @xmath1 and @xmath2 colour excess maps , we thus fitted a polynomial of 3rd order in @xmath9 and @xmath7 to the extinction free regions and subtracted it from the median colour maps .",

    "these are also the regions we analyse in detail in the forthcoming sections .",
    "the full resolution fits version of our entire map will be provided as online material to this paper .",
    "note that the construction of the final extinction maps as average of the @xmath16 extinction maps from @xmath1 and @xmath2 colour excess maps leads to further dilution of the very high extinction cores .",
    "this will , however , effect the same areas that are dominated by foreground stars , as described above .",
    "thus , the number of high column density regions in our analysis will be underestimated .",
    "the noise in the extinction map can in principle only be measured in extinction free regions as the standard deviation of extinction values from zero . to estimate the noise in all areas",
    "we have determined a noise map ( see fig.[noisemap ] ) . since we used the median colour of stars in each pixel , we need to determine the standard error of the median for our noise map . for a large sample and normal distribution",
    "this can in principle be done by @xmath17 = @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the error of the colour of the individual stars and @xmath20 the number of stars in each box .",
    "since we use stars of different photometric quality ( see below ) and we do not know if the sample of stars in each pixel follows a normal distribution , we can not use this equation .",
    "however , the fraction of stars for any given photometric quality is very constant ( see below ) .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the noise in each pixel is proportional to @xmath21 for both , the @xmath22 and @xmath2 maps .",
    "we have thus scaled and co - added the @xmath23 maps of stars with ( j and h ) and ( h and k ) photometry , in order to obtain the final noise map .",
    "the scaling was done to match the measured noise in the @xmath6 map in extinction free regions . as can be seen , the noise in the map varies significantly with galactic latitude , as well as with extinction .",
    "the 3@xmath19 noise ranges from 0.36mag optical extinction , close to the galactic plane , to 1.0mag @xmath6 in the most northern and southern parts of the map as well as in high extinction regions . in table[tab_beta ] we list for all individual regions the average number of stars with detections in j and h , as well as the average noise in the area .",
    "there are pixels in the map ( 0.0066% ) where the noise is extremely large , i.e , there are no stars to determine the colour .",
    "these regions are : 1 ) around very bright stars ; 2 ) at @xmath24 ; 3 ) high extinction cores in orion , taurus , perseus . for oria",
    "we determine an average noise of 0.24mag , which can be compared to the 1@xmath19 noise level of about 0.2mag @xmath6 obtained by lombardi & alves ( see their fig.6 ) in this region using the optimised nicer method .",
    "there are further areas in the map where the extinction values are not very reliable .",
    "these are positions close to dense star clusters . here",
    ", the high number of stars in the cluster dominates the extinction determination .",
    "hence , depending on the colour of the cluster members we measure either a too low ( mostly blue stars ) or too high ( mostly young , red stars ) extinction . since this is a common effect , we over plotted circles at the positions of all known star clusters ( found in simbad ) in the gray scale maps of our selected regions in appendix[app_images ] . additionally we over plot @xmath25 signs at the positions of all possible new star clusters with @xmath26 found by froebrich et al .",

    "does the use of 2mass quality bcd stars instead of only quality a stars influence the noise in our map ?",
    "independent of the position about 4045% of all stars are of quality aaa .",
    "given the larger errors in photometry for the quality bcd objects , one can estimate that the noise in the extinction map is about 10% ( i.e. 0.03mag ) higher , when including the lower quality objects .",
    "however , as has been pointed out by froebrich & del burgo @xcite , systematic errors of extinction determinations based on colour excess methods can be much higher than this , since the population of stars seen through a cloud can differ from the population of stars in a control field ( even if close - by ) .",
    "the more than twice as large number of stars per resolution element when including the lower quality objects will lead to a much better representation of the population of stars and , as a result , to smaller systematic errors .",
    "this out weights in our opinion the slightly higher resulting statistical noise in our maps and justifies the use of the lower quality 2mass sources .",
    "note that the galaxies m31 ( @xmath9=121.2 , @xmath7=-21.6 ) and m33 ( @xmath9=133.6 , @xmath7=-31.3 ) show up as apparently high extinction regions . in m31",

    "the conversion of colour excess maps into extinction maps requires the knowledge of the extinction law .",
    "our approach of using @xmath1 and @xmath28 colour excess maps enables us to determine the power law index of the extinction law using the colour excess ratio @xmath29@xmath30@xmath22/@xmath2 and @xmath31 from froebrich & del burgo @xcite .",
    "we now can analyse the resulting distribution of @xmath4 values in our maps .",
    "for all the following analysis of @xmath4 we use only areas where both , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 colour excess values are 3@xmath19 above the noise . in fig.[beta_dist",

    "it peaks at 1.73 , in good agreement with the canonical value for the interstellar medium ( draine ) .",
    "we hence use @xmath4=1.73 to convert our colour excess maps into extinction .",
    "the distribution of @xmath4 values shows a rather broad peak with a fwhm of 1.6 .",
    "this , seemingly , rather large value is in good agreement for the predicted scatter of about @xmath540% when using the colour excess ratio to determine @xmath4 ( see e.g. fig.1 in froebrich & del burgo @xcite ) .    it is possible to investigate in more detail , if the measured distribution of @xmath4 values @xmath33 is in agreement with a single value of @xmath34=1.73 in the entire field or not",
    "this can be done by convolving the observed distribution of signal to noise values , @xmath35 , in our extinction map from fig.[ext_map ] with the predictions for the width of the distribution of @xmath4 .",
    "we have , however , to allow for the possibility that there is an intrinsic scatter in the @xmath4 values ( @xmath36 ) around @xmath34 .",
    "we hence have to adapt equ.11 from froebrich & del burgo @xcite and obtain :    @xmath37 \\left ( \\frac{\\partial { \\bf b}(r)}{\\partial r } \\right)^2 + \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{int } } \\label{equ2}\\ ] ]    to determine the predicted distribution of @xmath4 values we use : @xmath38 were @xmath39 is a normalisation factor and @xmath40 the peak of the measured @xmath4 distribution . a kolmogorov smirnov test",
    "can then be performed with @xmath32 and @xmath41 to determine the probability ( @xmath42 ) that the two distributions are drawn from the same sample .    in order to determine the predicted @xmath4 distribution we require to estimate the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 represents the square of the ratio of the noise in the two colour excess maps and @xmath44 represents the ratio of the square of the noise in one colour excess map and the covariance of the two colour excess maps ( see equ.[equ2 ] and froebrich & del burgo @xcite for details ) . for our dataset",
    "we measure values of : @xmath43=3.6 and @xmath44=3.7 .",
    "note that the values for both parameters might slightly vary with position or hence from cloud to cloud .",
    "however , we have measured here the same values for @xmath43 and @xmath44 as were obtained for 2mass data in ic1396w by froebrich & del burgo @xcite . due to this fact , and since the dependence of the predicted @xmath4 distribution on @xmath43 and @xmath44 is rather weak , we fix these values for all our determinations .",
    "this gives us the possibility to vary the intrinsic scatter @xmath36 and the @xmath34 value until we find the highest probability @xmath42 that the observed and predicted distributions of @xmath4 values match .",
    "we list the obtained values of those parameters as well as the probabilities for the individual regions in table[tab_beta ] .",
    "we over plot the resulting best predicted distribution for @xmath4 values of the entire field as solid line in fig.[beta_dist ] .",
    "we find that with a 98.9% probability the two distributions are equal , when a value of @xmath45 and an intrinsic scatter of @xmath46 is assumed .",
    "the large intrinsic scatter shows , that there is a good chance that indeed variable @xmath4 values are present in different parts of the field . hence , repeating the same analysis for selected regions should lead to different @xmath4 values in different clouds . if locally those clouds have more uniform dust properties , then a lower intrinsic scatter should be found .",
    "thus , similar to the entire area , we investigate the peak value of the @xmath4 distribution , the intrinsic scatter and how well the distribution matches the assumption of a constant @xmath4 value for our individual regions . in table[tab_beta ] we summarise the obtained results .",
    "we find an average value of @xmath4=1.8@xmath50.2 . almost in all investigated regions",
    "the @xmath4 value is in agreement with the estimate for the entire field . only in auriga2 ( @xmath4=2.05 ) , monoceros ( @xmath4=1.52 ) and camelopardalis2 ( @xmath4=1.40 ) significantly different values are found , hinting to different dust properties such as the grain size distribution in these areas .",
    "notably , regions with smaller @xmath4 values tend to be closer to the galactic plane . however , it is not clear if this is caused by different dust properties or by the overlap of clouds in this area . furthermore , small systematic off - sets in either @xmath1 or @xmath2 can cause changes in the determined @xmath4 value .",
    "thus , the procedure of fitting a polynomial to the extinction free regions in order to determine the colour excess maps might also contribute to these smaller @xmath4 values .",
    "since very close to the galactic plane there are no extinction free regions , the procedure might have introduced a small off - set in the colour excess maps and hence to the @xmath4 values .",
    "clearly , more detailed investigations are required to find the cause of the smaller @xmath4 values very close to the galactic plane .",
    "we also find that for most regions the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath4 values is smaller or in the order of the value for the entire field . only in oria",
    "is a significantly larger value found .",
    "the probabilities that measured and predicted values are drawn from the same sample are listed in table[tab_beta ] and the individual distributions are shown in appendix[app_plots ] .",
    "we find that in some regions the proposal of constant @xmath4 values with the corresponding internal scatter is more probable than in others . especially in the regions monoceros and orib low probabilities ( @xmath47 ) are found .",
    "we can conclude that in these regions we do not see a dominant fraction of the dust possessing constant optical properties .",
    "this might indicate large scale variations of the optical dust properties within these clouds .",
    "in order to analyse and interpret the distribution of column density values in the entire map , as well as in the individual regions , we first have to recapitulate the selection effects induced by our method . as outlined in detail in sect.[extinction ] , our method of determining the extinction maps leads to three biases .",
    "( 1 ) very distant clouds , as well as very high extinction regions will not be detected by our method , since these areas are dominated by foreground stars .",
    "( 2 ) there is a small @xmath6 dilution with distance .",
    "( 3 ) the averaging of extinction maps from @xmath1 and @xmath48 colour excess maps leads to dilution of the high extinction cores .",
    "( 4 ) regions close to rich star clusters will be dominated by the colours of the cluster members . however , due to the use of the median stellar colours instead of the mean colours , all not too distant clouds without rich clusters and extremely dense cores , will have no systematically influenced extinction values .",
    "the general way of analysing the structure of molecular clouds is to determine the distribution of clumps within them .",
    "this includes the clump mass , size and column density distribution .",
    "we have hence used the @xmath49 - 2d algorithm ( williams et al .",
    "@xcite ) to extract all detectable clumps in our final extinction map and determined their size and mass distribution .",
    "contrary to line or dust emission maps , extinction maps have real , very smooth large scale profiles which make it very difficult to extract structure information using an automated thresholding technique .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the determined clump properties from our map depended , partly significantly , on the chosen levels and also on the pixel size of the map .",
    "hence , instead of using the clump properties in the map , we will analyse the column density distribution in the individual regions . since the distance of the clouds will influence the measured slope of the column density distribution ( see below ) , we will not analyse the distribution of the entire map as a whole .",
    "we show in appendix[app_plots ] the @xmath6 distributions for all individual regions ( solid line ) . for each region",
    "we fit a linear polynomial to the log(n ) vs. @xmath6 plots ( dashed line ) for extinction values larger than the 5@xmath19 noise ( vertical line ) .",
    "the measured slopes are indicated in the individual diagrams as well as in table[tab_beta ] .",
    "the individual @xmath6 distributions nicely show the above discussed biases for high extinction values . some show a clear drop - off for regions with very high column densities .",
    "depending on the distance of the cloud and its position , this drop - off occurs at different values . for oria and orib",
    "we see a clear drop at @xmath6=10mag , while for perseus ( @xmath6=8mag ) and camelopardalis2 ( @xmath6=6mag ) lower values are found .",
    "the values of the slopes range from about -0.3 to almost -1.0 , with the exception of camelopardalis3 where -1.2 is found .",
    "the interpretation of these values is , however , rather difficult .",
    "two effects could influence the measured slope : ( 1 ) the distance of the cloud ; ( 2 ) the intrinsic distribution of material .",
    "the distance could influence the slope since in more distant clouds the extinction per resolution element is averaged over a larger physical area in the cloud .",
    "hence , for more distant clouds the column density distribution on larger physical scales is measured .",
    "one can artificially move a cloud to larger distances by using a larger box - size for the extinction measurements .",
    "indeed one finds that this results in a steeper column density distribution .",
    "this is in agreement with the values obtained from our data , where more distant clouds possess on average steeper column density distributions .",
    "we basically find that in all clouds where our resolution element is smaller than 1pc the slope of the distribution is -0.3 .",
    "for all clouds were we are not able to resolve 1pc ( cloud distance larger than 850pc ) the slope in the column density distribution is about -0.75 .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that there might be a change in the governing physics determining the column density distribution in molecular clouds on a scale of about 1pc .",
    "interestingly , this is about the jeans length for a column density that is required for self - shielding and molecular hydrogen formation in molecular clouds ( hartmann et al .",
    "the already discussed small @xmath6 dilution with distance could as well contribute to the change in the slope .",
    "furthermore , there could also be intrinsic differences between clouds , as reflected by the different slopes measured for e.g. oria and orib , which are believed to be at the same distance .",
    "we note however , that if measured only for @xmath50 the slope for orib is -0.32 , hence in very good agreement with oria and the other close - by clouds taurus and perseus .",
    "for the region with @xmath51 in orib the slope is -0.75 , indicating that these clouds are more distant .",
    "we further note that an overlap of different clouds , as may happen close to the galactic plane , does not change the measured slope if the individual clouds are at about the same distance and have intrinsically the same slope .",
    "using grid technology and 2mass data we created the largest extinction map to date based on near infrared colour excess .",
    "our 127@xmath52 sized map of the galactic anticenter contains the molecular cloud complexes of orion , taurus , cepheus , monoceros , auriga , camelopardalis and cassiopeia .",
    "the three sigma noise level ranges from 0.36mag optical extinction close to the galactic plane to 1.0mag @xmath6 at @xmath53 and in high extinction regions .",
    "our final optical extinction map has a resolution of 4 and a pixel size of 2.    the colour excess ratio @xmath1/@xmath2 is used to determine the power law index @xmath4 of the wavelength dependence of the extinction in the near infrared . in the entire field the distribution of @xmath4 peaks at a value of 1.73 .",
    "the average value of the investigated cloud complexes is determined to @xmath54 .",
    "both values are in agreement with the assumed values for the interstellar medium .",
    "we analyse in detail the distribution of @xmath4 values in the entire field and individual regions .",
    "it is found that there is an internal scatter in the @xmath4 values of about 0.40.5 .",
    "a comparison of the measured and predicted @xmath4 distribution by means of a kolmogorov smirnov tests shows that in most regions the proposal of a constant @xmath4 with an internal scatter is valid . in some regions ( e.g. monoceros , orib ) low probabilities that observations and predictions match",
    "are found .",
    "hence , there is no dominant @xmath4 value in the cloud , a clear indication of large scale variations of the optical dust properties in these areas .",
    "we further analysed the column density distribution of the individual regions .",
    "due to our technique , the highest extinction cores ( @xmath5510mag ) can not be identified reliably . for extinction values",
    "up to 10mag @xmath6 we find that the column density distributions show a linear behavior in the log(n ) vs. @xmath6 plot . on average a steeper column density distribution for more distant clouds",
    "is found , i.e. the @xmath6 distribution is steeper when measured on larger spatial scales .",
    "this seems to indicate a change in the governing physics of the column density at scales of about 1pc or an @xmath6 dilution with distance in our map .",
