    "since the advent of quantum groups and quantum algebras  @xcite , there has been a lot of interest in deformations of the harmonic oscillator , since the latter plays a central role in the investigation of many physical systems .",
    "most studies were concerned with the one - dimensional oscillator  @xcite .",
    "various @xmath0-deformed versions of standard quantum mechanics in the schrdinger representation were proposed for the latter by using either the ordinary differentiation operator ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , or a @xmath0-differentiation one ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the many - body problem for one - dimensional @xmath0-oscillators or , equivalently , the deformation of the @xmath6-dimensional harmonic oscillator in cartesian coordinates was also considered  @xcite , but relatively few works dealt with the deformation of the same in radial and angular coordinates . in one approach  @xcite , only the radial problem was deformed via a purely algebraic procedure based upon a @xmath7 dynamical symmetry algebra . only the @xmath8 case was dealt with in detail , although extensions to higher dimension would in principle be feasible .    in another type of analysis , use was made of a differential calculus on the @xmath6-dimensional non - commutative euclidean space  @xcite to construct and solve a @xmath0-deformed schrdinger equation for the isotropic harmonic oscillator  @xcite .",
    "in such a setting , the underlying so(@xmath6 ) symmetry gets replaced by an so@xmath9(@xmath6 ) symmetry . in still another study",
    "@xcite , the wave functions and energy spectrum of the @xmath0-isotropic oscillator were obtained in a rather indirect way from some previous results for the @xmath0-linear oscillator  @xcite .",
    "the latter were derived by replacing classical poisson brackets by @xmath0-commutators ( instead of standard commutators ) . in the last two approaches ,",
    "the wave functions involve some non - commutative objects : the variables of the quantum euclidean space in the former , and the elements of the su@xmath9(2 ) quantum group in the latter .",
    "this complicates the calculation and interpretation of operator matrix elements .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to present an entirely different approach to the @xmath0-deformation of the su(2)-invariant schrdinger equation of a spinless particle in a central potential , which allows us not only to determine a deformed spectrum as in other works , but also to easily calculate the expectation values of some physically - relevant operators , thereby evaluating the deformation influence on the corresponding wave functions .",
    "here we consider in detail the case of a particle in an isotropic harmonic oscillator and of the quadrupole operator governing its interaction with an external field .    in our approach ,",
    "only the angular sector is deformed by using a representation of the su@xmath9(2 ) quantum algebra on the two - dimensional sphere  @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to an appropriate change in the angular part of the scalar product  @xcite , and to the substitution of the su@xmath9(2 ) casimir operator eigenvalue for the su(2 ) one in the radial schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "the latter step may be performed in various ways since there is no unique rule for constructing the su@xmath9(2 ) casimir operator .",
    "similarly , the deforming parameter @xmath0 may be assumed either real and positive , or on the unit circle in the complex plane ( but different from a root of unity ) , provided different scalar products are used  @xcite .",
    "we will study the effects of these two choices on the solutions of the radial schrdinger equation .    in section  [ sec : equation ] , the su@xmath9(2)-invariant schrdinger equation of the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator is introduced and solved . in section  [ sec : spectrum ] , its spectrum is studied in detail for various choices of su@xmath9(2 ) casimir operators and @xmath0 ranges . the effect of the deformation on the corresponding wave functions is determined in section  [ sec : quadrupole ] by calculating the quadrupole moment in @xmath5 states .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] contains the conclusion .",

    "similar results can be derived for higher @xmath42 values , and close enough to @xmath87 , for given @xmath117 and @xmath42 values one always finds a single eigenvalue going into the undeformed one , @xmath118 , for @xmath119 . for all @xmath42 values",
    ", the expansion of this eigenvalue into powers of @xmath86 can be obtained from equation  ( [ eq : e - expansion ] ) by substituting @xmath120 for @xmath86 .",
    "hence , in a small enough neighbourhood of @xmath87 , for @xmath71 , @xmath89 and @xmath63 are decreasing functions of @xmath86 , whereas @xmath121 is increasing and @xmath92 remains constant .",
    "the first few eigenvalues @xmath93 , going into @xmath122 when @xmath123 , are displayed on figure  2 for @xmath96 .",
    "one should remember that for some @xmath42 and @xmath86 values , there may exist other eigenvalues , which are not plotted on the figure , and that the discrete set of points , where @xmath86 is equal to a root of unity , is excluded .",
    "such is the case , in particular , of the points where @xmath93 ( @xmath71 ) takes its minimal value  1 , and of the point @xmath124 , where @xmath125 for any @xmath42 value .",
    "the influence of the deformation on the spectrum is rather striking . for high @xmath86 values ,",
    "the levels get mixed in a very complicated way .",
    "it is remarkable that in the neighbourhood of @xmath124 , one obtains a spectrum very close to one with equidistant , infinitely - degenerate levels .    in the @xmath80 case ,",
    "the situation is still more complex as some @xmath42 values may disappear on some intervals . in the neighbourhood of @xmath87 , however , as in the real @xmath0 case , @xmath63 can not be distinguished from @xmath89 .",
    "the purpose of the present section is to study the effect of the deformation on the wave functions of the @xmath4-invariant harmonic oscillator , given in equation  ( [ eq : wf ] ) , ( [ eq : r ] ) , and  ( [ eq : s ] ) , by determining the variation with @xmath86 of the expectation value of some physically - relevant operator . for the latter , we choose the electric quadrupole moment operator , and we consider the quadrupole moment in a state with definite @xmath117 , @xmath42 values , which is defined conventionally as  @xcite @xmath126 equation  ( [ eq : q ] ) corresponds to the choice @xmath14 for the @xmath4 casimir operator .",
    "when using instead @xmath80 , the quadrupole moment will be denoted by @xmath127 .",
    "the undeformed counterpart of @xmath128 and @xmath127 is given by @xmath129 it vanishes for @xmath5 as a result of the familiar selection rule for the angular momenta @xmath42 and 2 coupling .",
    "nonvanishing values of @xmath130 or @xmath131 will therefore be a direct measure of the effect of the deformation .",
    "note that since in the @xmath14 case , there are two energy eigenvalues with @xmath5 and a given @xmath117 value for @xmath2 ( see equation  ( [ eq : l=0-c - r ] ) ) , we have to distinguish the corresponding quadrupole moments by a @xmath132 subscript .    as in equation  ( [ eq : q - undef ] )",
    ", @xmath130 can be factorized into radial and angular matrix elements , @xmath133 for any @xmath42 value , the former is simply obtained by replacing @xmath42 by @xmath134 in the undeformed radial matrix element . hence @xmath135 the calculation of the latter is more complicated as it implies the use of the deformed angular scalar product  ( [ eq : scalprod ] ) , @xmath136 where @xmath137 this integral can be easily performed by making the changes of variables @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141  @xcite .",
    "one gets @xmath142    introducing equation  ( [ eq : i ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : def - angular ] ) , we finally obtain @xmath143 hence @xmath144 the deformed quadrupole moment @xmath130 is therefore an even function of @xmath86 , so that we may again restrict ourselves to @xmath145 or @xmath146 according to whether @xmath0 is real or complex .",
    "the deformed radial matrix element  ( [ eq : def - radial ] ) ( or its counterpart for @xmath131 ) , being just equal to the corresponding energy eigenvalue in the units used , varies in the same way with @xmath86 . from equations  ( [ eq : l=0-c - r ] ) , ( [ eq : l=0-c ] ) and  ( [ eq : l=0-c - s ] ) , it follows that for increasing @xmath86 , it decreases ( resp .",
    "increases ) from @xmath147 ( resp .",
    "@xmath148 ) to @xmath149 for @xmath14 , @xmath2 , and @xmath76 ( resp .",
    "@xmath77 ) , increases from @xmath147 to @xmath150 for @xmath14 , @xmath3 , and remains constant for @xmath80 , @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "the effect of the deformation is therefore not significant , except in the case of @xmath14 when @xmath3 .    for real @xmath0 ,",
    "the deformed angular matrix element , given in equation  ( [ eq : def - angular - bis ] ) , increases from 0 to 2 when @xmath86 goes from 0 to @xmath150 .",
    "hence , it is obvious that @xmath151 and @xmath131 are increasing positive functions of @xmath86 .",
    "it can be checked that the same is true for @xmath152 , the variation of the angular part of the matrix element dominating that of the radial one . on figure  3 , @xmath152 , @xmath151 , and @xmath131",
    "are displayed in terms of @xmath86 for @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "one can see some effect of the choice of casimir operator and @xmath155 root , but it becomes significant only for a very large deformation .",
    "it should be stressed that the undeformed quadrupole moments in @xmath71 states and the deformed ones in @xmath5 states have opposite signs .",
    "both become comparable in absolute value for @xmath156 .    for complex @xmath0 ,",
    "the deformed angular matrix element  ( [ eq : def - angular - bis ] ) decreases from 0 to @xmath157 when @xmath86 goes from 0 to @xmath158 .",
    "hence , both @xmath130 and @xmath131 are decreasing negative functions of @xmath86 . on figure",
    "4 , they are displayed in terms of @xmath86 for @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "apart from the sign , which is now the same as that of @xmath159 for @xmath71 , the conclusions remain similar to those for the real @xmath0 case .",
    "in the present letter , we did show that as those of the free particle and of the coulomb potential  @xcite , the @xmath4-invariant schrdinger equation of the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator can be easily solved not only for @xmath2 , but also for generic @xmath3 .",
    "it is worth stressing that we have been working in the framework of the usual schrdinger equation ( i.e. , with no non - commuting objects contrary to some other approaches  @xcite ) , but with wave functions belonging to a hilbert space different from the usual one , since the angular part of the scalar product has been modified when going from @xmath1 to @xmath4  @xcite .    in the real @xmath0 case",
    ", we did show that the spectrum is rather similar to the undeformed one , except that the energy levels are no more equidistant and that their degeneracy is lifted . for a given @xmath117 value ,",
    "the spacing between adjacent levels corresponding to @xmath42 and @xmath160 , respectively , increases with @xmath42 and with the deformation .",
    "in addition , there appears a supplementary series of @xmath5 levels when the casimir operator @xmath14 is used .",
    "apart from this , for small deformations , the results are rather insensitive to the choice made for the casimir operator .    in the complex @xmath0 case",
    ", we did show that the spectrum is more complicated as for @xmath71 and any @xmath117 value , there may exist 0 , 1 , or 2 levels according to the deformation .",
    "the existence or inexistence of levels is also rather sensitive to the choice made for the casimir operator .",
