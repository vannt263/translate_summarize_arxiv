    "in quasars and radio galaxies there is a relation between the properties of the radio source and those of the ( optical ) line - emitting gas ( miley 1983 ; tadhunter , fosbury , & quinn 1989 ; jackson 1995 ) .",
    "compact steep - spectrum ( css ) radio sources often show disturbed kinematics of the interstellar gas coupled to associated radio components , providing evidence for gas outflow .",
    "the interaction between radio jets and the host galaxy s ism may be responsible for the jet confinement to small scales and can contribute to the ionization of the medium and lead to star formation ( axon 1998 ; clark 1998 ; villar - martin 1998 and 1999 ) .",
    "thus , detailed study of the circumnuclear regions is essential in understanding the processes that drive the kinematics , physical conditions and morphology of the line emitting gas .",
    "3c 48 harbours an unusually steep - core ( @xmath00.7 ) powerful compact radio source deeply embedded in the host galaxy .",
    "its vlbi radio structure ( figure 1 lower panel ) comprises a relatively weak core , elongated n - s and a powerful one - sided jet to the north , highly disrupted at @xmath10.05 from the core , through collisions with the dense interstellar medium .",
    "this jet then expands out to @xmath11 ne within the body of the host galaxy .",
    "about 1.3 ne from the main nucleus of 3c 48 , roughly coinciding with the edge of the radio jet , a high surface brightness region ( 3c 48a ) was detected in stellar continuum light , which was tentatively identified with a second nucleus in the process of capture ( stockton & ridgway 1991 ; hook 1994 ) . in a recent paper ( chatzichristou , vanderriest , & jaffe 1999 ) we have shown that this is more likely a region of intense star formation , triggered by the interaction of the radio jet with the dense interstellar medium of the host galaxy .",
    "this interpretation is further supported by the diffuse , knotty morphology of 3c 48a as seen in hst images ( project id#05235 ; also , canalizo & stockton 2000 ) .    using the technique of integral field spectroscopy at the chft , we have mapped the dynamics and emission line properties of the extended ionized gas of 3c 48 at a resolution of @xmath10.7 . in particular , we have found that the narrow emission line profiles in the central ( @xmath2 ) region are split in two components , a fast moving ( @xmath1580 km s@xmath3 with respect to the systemic velocity ) , blue - shifted , broad ( @xmath11000 km s@xmath3 ) component , co - spatial with the radio - jet and a spatially resolved , narrow ( @xmath1400 km s@xmath3 ) component at the systemic redshift ( figure 1 upper panel ) . on the basis of these results and simple energetic arguments we argued ( chatzichristou 1999 ) that the blue - shifted component might represent the imprint of the jet interaction , with the ambient gas .",
    "its emission line ratios indicate that the dominant ionizing mechanism are most probably shocks driven by the radio jet into the interstellar medium .",
    "these results are intriguing and need further investigation , using data of higher quality and better spatial / spectral resolution , to establish the detailed gas kinematics in the innermost ( @xmath11 - 2 kpc ) region .",
    "detection of additional velocity components coupled to the associated radio components ( figure 1 lower panel ) , will provide direct observational evidence for the agn - driven outflow and for the motions due to bow - shocks driven by the radio jet into the ambient gas .",
    "using stis aboard hst in long slit mode , we mapped the central 1 region in steps of 0.3 placing the slit along the extended line emission ( n - s ) previously detected @xmath115 north from the nucleus .",
    "the spectral and spatial resolution of these new data represent an improvement by factors @xmath15 - 10 compared to the previous data ( figure 1 , upper panel ) .",
    "the analysis of these data is in progress .",
    "we study the gas kinematics primarily through the @xmath4_{5007}$ ] narrow emission line and use a variety of diagnostic emission line ratios ( @xmath4/h\\beta , [ oi]/h\\alpha , [ nii]/h\\alpha$ ] ) to investigate the ionization structure of the emitting regions .",
    "the complexity of the line profiles and the multiplicity of detected velocity components is obvious in figure 2 .",
    "a third high velocity component , at -1150 km s@xmath3 , is clearly identified and dominates the line emission at @xmath10.5 ne of the nucleus .",
    "there is a wealth of structure in the line profiles , obviously coupled to the radio components seen in figure 1 and on more recent vlbi data .",
    "the full analysis and results will be presented in a forthcoming paper , where the main questions addressed will be : what is(are ) the acceleration mechanism(s ) and where exactly in the flow is the gas accelerated ? what is the dominant ionization mechanism ? furthermore , comparison with the ionized gas that lies further out from the radio axis allows us to estimate the cooling times and thus the shock velocities involved .",
    "comparison of these results with existing dynamical models for the formation of nlr in agns will help to further constrain these models for larger jet powers and to clarify the regime of jet confinement ."
