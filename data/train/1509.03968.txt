    "<S> we make a remark on the degree of nonlocality on the quasi - conserved quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath60th order truncated floquet hamiltonian has effective @xmath78-body interactions , and hence the nonlocality looks large . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a high frequency driving , higher order contributions in the fm expansion are very small , since @xmath4 is small . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant contribution is in fact the original hamiltonian @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , nonlocality of the truncated floquet hamiltonian is not very strong . </S>",
    "<S> eigenstates for the truncated floquet hamiltonian @xmath65 thus should satisfy the usual eth , not the floquet eth . in addition , we should note that from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : convergent ] ) , @xmath80 for any @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> hence these truncated floquet hamiltonians are not independent but almost the same . </S>",
    "<S> practically one can approximate the quasi - conserved quantity @xmath65 by @xmath81 .    </S>",
    "<S> taking account of those , we discuss a scenario on the initial stage of relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> since the quasi - conserved quantity exists with long lifetime , the system relaxes to _ a quasi - stationary state _ characterized by the quasi - conserved quantity , which will be close to a state corresponding to the ( micro)canonical ensemble @xmath82 of the effective hamiltonian @xmath65 set by the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> approximately one can use @xmath83 ( the equilibrium ensemble of @xmath79 ) instead of @xmath82 because @xmath80 for any @xmath72 .    </S>",
    "<S> the initial stage of relaxation can be classified into two cases , i.e. , ( i ) the case where the relaxation to the quasi - stationary state is faster than the energy relaxation , and ( ii ) the case where both relaxation times are comparable . in the case ( i ) , the system first reaches the quasi - stationary state , and then relaxes to the true steady state . </S>",
    "<S> this is highly related to the prethermalization phenomenon in the isolated nearly - integrable systems @xcite , where the system first relaxes to a quasi - stationary state corresponding to the generalized gibbs ensemble and next relaxes to the true steady state . </S>",
    "<S> this is what we numerically observed in fig.[fig1 ] ( b ) and ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , in fig .  [ fig1 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , @xmath84 in the quasi - stationary state , which is close to @xmath85 ( the dotted line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( b ) ) at the inverse temperature @xmath41 that is determined from the expectation value of @xmath40 at @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact indicates that the quasi - stationary state is actually described by @xmath83 in this model . in the case ( ii ) , on the other hand , the relaxation process towards the quasi - stationary state and that towards the true steady state are indistinguishable , and hence stable quasi - stationary behavior is not observed in the initial stage of relaxation .    because the timescale of energy relaxation becomes longer exponentially as the frequency increases </S>",
    "<S> , we expect to find the case ( i ) for sufficiently high - frequencies unless there is some special reason such as conservation laws  @xcite , strong quenched disorder  @xcite , diverging timescale due to quantum criticality  @xcite , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis deals with general spin models , which makes clear why the heating is slow in a precise manner and leads us to the universal scenario of relaxation processes . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our evaluation , the single - site energy is overestimated and the effect of quantum interference is underestimated . hence , the divergence of the fm expansion presumably begins at a higher order than our estimation @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that our estimation on the timescale is _ a rigorous lower bound _ that can be exponentially large in frequency , and hence the actual timescale of the heating will be longer than our estimation   is typically about @xmath87 hz , @xmath31 , and then the condition @xmath88 implies @xmath89 khz , which has been achieved in experiment [ a. zenesini , h. lignier , d. ciampini , o. morsch , and e. arimondo , http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/physrevlett.102.100403[phys . </S>",

    "<S> according to our estimation , the heating timescale in this case is about 1 msec , which is a typical timescale of cold - atom experiments . ] . in order to obtain a quantitatively accurate estimate for a specific model </S>",
    "<S> , we will have to study the quantum dynamics of the given model numerically .    </S>",
    "<S> related to the above remark , we emphasize that our result does not tell us about the true steady state . </S>",
    "<S> it should be an infinite - temperature state if the floquet eth holds . </S>",
    "<S> however , another possibility is not excluded ; there might be an energy - localized phase  @xcite with vanishing energy - absorption rate . </S>",
    "<S> it is an open problem to understand the precise condition of the floquet eth .    _ </S>",
    "<S> summary. _    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have considered the quantum dynamics of general driven spin systems that have at most @xmath30-body interactions and a bounded single - site energy @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we have rigorously shown the theorem stating that the truncated floquet hamiltonian is a quasi - conserved quantity and the rate of energy absorption is exponentially small in frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this finding enables us to classify the initial stage of relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> it is emphasized that we need not assume short - range interactions in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_spin ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath90 , which corresponds to the heisenberg all - to - all couplings , satisfies the condition of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : g ] ) with a fixed value of @xmath18 even in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the result in this paper is applicable to most physically - relevant spin models . </S>",
    "<S> however , as seen in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : g ] ) , our argument excludes bosonic systems . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that our analysis will help to understand even for bosonic systems .    </S>",
