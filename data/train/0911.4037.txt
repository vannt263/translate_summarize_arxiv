    "<S> we present lattice simulations of a center symmetric dimensionally reduced effective field theory for su(2 ) yang mills which employ thermal wilson lines and three - dimensional magnetic fields as fundamental degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the action is composed of a gauge invariant kinetic term , spatial gauge fields and a potential for the wilson line which includes a `` fuzzy '' bag term to generate non - perturbative fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the effective potential for the polyakov loop is extracted from the simulations including all modes of the loop as well as for cooled configuration where the hard modes have been averaged out . </S>",
    "<S> the former is found to exhibit a non - analytic contribution while the latter can be described by a mean - field like _ ansatz _ with quadratic and quartic terms , plus a vandermonde potential which depends upon the location within the phase diagram . </S>"
