    "dynamics of multiple stars contains information on their origin . from this perspective , triple systems where elements of both outer and inner orbits are known and reasonably accurate are particularly interesting , as relative orbit orientation , period ratio , and interaction between subsystems can be studied ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , such well - studied multiples are still rare , requiring a substantial observational effort .",
    "this work deals with one of those , @xmath1 aquarii .",
    "papers bearing nearly the same title as the present one have been published by @xcite and @xcite .    the naked - eye ( @xmath2 mag )",
    "visual binary @xmath1 aquarii was measured in 1779 by w.  hershel , but an earlier observation is listed in the first double - star catalog by @xcite , so we do not know the name of its real discoverer . coordinates and basic identifiers of the components are given in table  [ tab : id ] .",
    "the proper motion is @xmath3mas  yr@xmath4 , the trigonometric parallax is 35.50@xmath01.26mas @xcite , the spectral type is f3iii - iv .",
    "the two pairs are designated in the wds @xcite as stf  2909  ab and ebe  1  aa , ab , although they have not been discovered by w.  struve and j.  ebersberger .",

    "the binary traveled only a short arc during the 19th century , but in the 20th century it became closer and moved faster .",
    "photographic measurements available since 1900 are more precise than visual micrometer estimates .",
    "they revealed deviations from the pure keplerian motion with a 25-year period , first discovered by @xcite . since then",
    ", several authors have undertaken reanalysis of the orbital motions in this triple system ( table  [ tab : hist ] ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that dynamical interaction between components causes measurable deviation from the purely keplerian motion ( see also recent work by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "yet , @xcite argued that the variation of the osculating orbital elements is too slow to matter and fitted the data by two keplerian orbits .",
    "as shown below , even this first - order approximation of the observed motion was , so far , quite inaccurate ; it is improved here to set the stage for a future dynamical analysis .",
    "the motion of visual binaries is traditionally represented by an orbit of the secondary component b around the primary a. the `` wave '' in the motion was implicitly attributed to the `` dark '' ( unseen ) companion around b , until @xcite demonstrated that the perturbing body actually revolves around the component a. he categorically dismissed the detections of this dark companion to b by infrared interferometry @xcite and the claimed resolution of aa , ab by optical speckle interferometry @xcite , as they did not match the orbit . indeed , the large magnitude difference between aa and ab ( @xmath8 mag ) and the modest dynamic range of early speckle instruments made such a resolution impossible . despite the separation exceeding 05 , the putative subsystem aa ,",
    "ab has not been resolved in subsequent speckle observations until 2009 .",
    "note that @xcite calculated visibility from one - dimensional scans in the north - south direction that can not distinguish which of the binary components is resolved . their attribution of the tertiary to b was based entirely on the literature . at the time of their observation , 1981.94 , the position of aa , ab was at ( 1686 , 023 ) according to the new orbit , so it does not contradict their measured projected separation of 017@xmath0004 .",
    "however , the relative photometry in @xcite disagrees with our estimates , throwing doubt on this claimed resolution .",
    "the first real detection of the third body in the @xmath1  aqr system has been made by adaptive optics in the @xmath9 band at the southern astrophysical research telescope , soar @xcite .",
    "the two stars a and b were observed separately , and the tertiary has been erroneously attributed to b. this has been corrected in the following observations , securely associating the low - mass tertiary with the main component a. direct images of the subsystem aa , ab are given by @xcite .",
    "the tertiary ab , 5.4 mag fainter than aa in the @xmath9 band , is just detectable by modern speckle interferometry , which furnishes better spatial resolution and more accurate positions compared to the long - exposure imaging with partial ao correction ( figure  [ fig : acf ] ) .",
    "the resolved measures of aa , ab do not match the latest astrometric orbit of aa , ab by @xcite .",
    "arbitrary adjustment of the orbit was suggested by @xcite to reach a better agreement . since the work by @xcite , the inner subsystem aa , ab has made one full revolution ,",
    "so the next iteration on the orbits , now accounting for the resolved measures of aa , ab , can be made .",
    "this is the purpose of the present work .",

    "in my first attempt to update the orbits , i used an obvious but wrong strategy : fit the motion of a , b in the outer orbit and then represent the residuals from this motion by the inner astrometric orbit of aa , ab .",
    "the inner orbit is eccentric , therefore the star aa , practically coincident with the photo - center a , spends most of the time near apastron and is displaced from the center of mass of aa , ab .",
    "the outer orbit must describe the motion of b around the center of mass , not around the photo - center ( component a ) . when the outer orbit is computed from the positions of a , b , the average residuals are minimized , and the perturbation ( deviations of a from the outer orbit ) becomes centrally symmetric , leading to the false inner orbit with a small eccentricity .",
    "this explains why astrometric orbits tend to have small eccentricities in general .",
    "whenever an astrometric binary is resolved , it often turns out that its true visual orbit has a larger eccentricity than the astrometric orbit .",
    "@xcite discussed this effect and insisted on fitting the two orbits simultaneously .",
    "yet , @xcite ignored his warning and derived the inner orbit of @xmath1  aqr with a small eccentricity after fitting and subtracting the outer orbit .",
    "i include the resolved measures of aa , ab together with the positions of a , b in the data set and fit 15 free parameters : seven elements of a , b , seven elements of aa , ab , and @xmath10 , the ratio of the true and astrometric semimajor axes in the inner orbit . if the subsystem belonged to the b , the parameter @xmath10 would be negative ( the reflex displacement of b is oposite to the vector ba , bb ) , but here it is positive .",
    "i modified the idl code orbit.pro to fit both orbits simultaneously .",
    "the least - squares fitting implicitly assumes that the measurement errors are known and normally distributed . in this ideal case ,",
    "the weights are inversely proportional to the squares of the measurement errors @xmath11 .",
    "it is well known , however , that visual micrometer measures of binary stars are not normally distributed , showing both large occasional deviations and systematic errors ( see figure  [ fig : hist ] ) .",
    "there is no general rule allowing to describe these data by normally distributed random variables .",
    "photographic measurements of binary stars can also have larger - than - usual errors caused by poor seeing , systematic errors proper to photography ( interaction of closely spaced images in the emulsion ) , and subjective errors of persons who measured the plates .",
    "the ccd - based measurements should be better than the photography , although this is not the case for some low - quality ccd measures made by amateurs . in the speckle interferometry ,",
    "the uncertainty of the pixel scale and detector orientation , difficult to quantify , is often a major contributor to the position errors of wide pairs such as @xmath1  aqr .",
    "published errors of speckle measures do not always include the calibration errors .",
    "the only viable approach to this problem is to censor the data by rejecting obvious outliers and to treat the errors of the remaining measurements as unknowns , estimating them from the orbital solution itself .",
    "the large number of measurements of @xmath1  aqr favors this strategy .",
    "i used averaged micrometer measures made prior to 1900 , taking them from the paper by @xcite , and assumed their errors of 01 .",
    "all micrometer measures made after 1900 are ignored , as more accurate and objective photographic observations became available .",
    "i adopted the errors of photographic measures prior to 1940 as 50 mas , then as 30 mas , same as for the accepted ccd measures .",
    "the speckle measures are assumed to have errors of 3 to 9 mas .",
    "obvious outliers were deleted .",
    "then , in the process of fitting the orbits , those measures that deviated by more than @xmath12 in either coordinate were given an increased @xmath11 to bring their deviation to the @xmath13 level .",
    "after several rounds of manual error adjustment and automatic down - weighting of outliers , the resulting normalized goodness of fit @xmath14 ( @xmath15 being the number of degrees of freedom ) became close to one in both coordinates .",
    "the 322 retained observations of a , b , their adopted errors , and residuals to the orbits are listed in table  [ tab : obsab ] . given the large number of measures , it is not practical to cite references to all of them .",
    "a similar table  [ tab : obsaa ] gives the resolved measures of aa , ab , all coming from the speckle interferometry at soar .",
    "the latest measure in 2016.39 is still unpublished .    in the following ,",
    "i denote the orbital elements of the outer and inner pairs by the indices 1 and 2 , respectively , and use common notation ( @xmath16  period , @xmath17  epoch of periastron , @xmath18  eccentricity , @xmath19  semimajor axis , @xmath20  position angle of the node , @xmath21  argument of periastron , @xmath22  orbital inclination ) .",
    "the orbital elements found by fitting 15 parameters are listed in table  [ tab : orb ] . for the inner orbit , the astrometric semimajor axis @xmath23 is given ; it should be multiplied by @xmath10 to get the true axis .",
    "the weighted rms residuals to the measures of a , b are 15mas in both coordinates .",
    "the resolved measures of aa , ab have rms residuals of 10mas .",
    "they are less accurate than most speckle data from soar because of the large magnitude difference between aa and ab .",
    "the periods @xmath24 and @xmath25 are similar to their values found in the previous studies , but the inner eccentricity @xmath26 found here is substantially larger ( see table  [ tab : hist ] ) .",
    "although the overall character of the orbital motion is well defined , the range of inner orbits compatible with the data is quite large , more than suggested by the formal errors of the elements .",
    "additional consideration helps to select the most plausible inner orbit .",
    "owing to the faintness of ab , it is safe to assume that the photo - center of the composite component a is located at the primary aa , so the measurements of a , b and aa , b are equivalent . in such case , the mass ratio in the inner pair @xmath27 .",
    "the mass sum of the inner pair is proportional to @xmath28 , the mass sum of the outer pair is proportional to @xmath29 . as the stars aa and b have very similar brightness , we expect equal masses @xmath30 .",
    "so , the ratio of the mass sums in the inner and outer orbits should be close to @xmath31 .",
    "this leads to @xmath32 both periods and the outer semimajor axis @xmath33 are rather well defined , hence the inner semimajor axis should be @xmath34 according to this equation .",
    "the unconstrained least - squares fit produces an inner orbit with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , too large to match the expected inner mass sum .",
    "convergence of astrometric orbits derived from noisy data to nearly parabolic solutions has been studied by @xcite , and here we have a similar situation . as the line of apsides of aa , ab is almost perpendicular to the line of nodes ( @xmath37 ) , increasing the inclination @xmath38 , the eccentricity @xmath39 , and the semimajor axis @xmath23 simultaneously has little effect on the apparent orbital ellipse .",
    "the measures alone do not constrain well enough the semimajor axis of the inner orbit and allow solutions with unrealistically large @xmath23 .",
    "the final orbits ( figure  [ fig : ab ] ) were obtained by fixing @xmath23 to the value given by ( [ eq : masses ] ) and fitting all other elements plus @xmath10 .",
    "then the new value of @xmath23 was computed and the constrained fit was repeated , until the iterations converged to @xmath40 .",
    "there is no doubt that the inner orbit has a high eccentricity ; for example , a fixed @xmath41 leads to substantially larger residuals .",
    "visual measures in the 19th century seem to deviate systematically from the orbit of a , b .",
    "this could be caused by an over - estimation of the angular separation .",
    "however , such residuals might also result from dynamical interaction between the orbits , according to @xcite .",
    "one can not help noting that the outer and inner pairs move in the opposite directions , retrograde and prograde , hence their orbital angular momenta can not be aligned .",
    "there are no radial velocity ( rv ) data of adequate precision to establish the correct orbital nodes .",
    "examination of the disparate published rvs indicates that rv(a ) was less than rv(b ) in the first half of the 20th century , meaning that the node @xmath42 corresponds to the component a. the amplitude of the rv difference between a and b is about 4 km  s@xmath4 , presently it is + 3 km  s@xmath4 according to the new orbit .",
    "however , the orbit of aa , ab is seen almost face - on , so the rvs of a might be of little help for defining the inner node .",
    "fortunately , the two possible angles between the orbital angular momentum vectors computed without knowledge of the true nodes are close to each other : @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the period ratio is @xmath45 .",
    "relative orientation of the orbits and the high inner eccentricity are strongly suggestive of the kozai - lidov cycles in this triple system .",
    "if the inner orbit were originally almost perpendicular to the outer orbit , it would evolve towards high eccentricity and relative inclination of 39or 141 . in a system of three point masses",
    "the inclination and inner eccentricity oscillate with a period on the order of @xmath46kyr , but real stars can tidally interact at periastron , locking the inner orbit in the high-@xmath18 state , with subsequent circularization @xcite .",
    "however , the distance between aa and ab at periastron is about 1.4 a.u .",
    ", too large for tidal interaction .",
