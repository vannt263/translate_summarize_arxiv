    "accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) is the energy house of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . applying models of accretion disks to fit the observed big blue bumps in the continuum of agns and quasars",
    ", one finds that smbhs accrete typically with sub - eddington rates ( laor & netzer 1989 ; sun & malkan 1989 ; brunner et al . 1997 ; l 2008 ) . observational examination of the soltan argument for the cosmological growth of smbhs prefers that they grow episodically through baryon accretion ( yu & tremaine 2002 ; wang et al .",
    "2009a ) , in agreement with the paradigm of coevolution with their host galaxies .",
    "however , what is governing accretion rates of active smbhs ?",
    "we have several relevant clues to understanding the formation of the accretion flows approaching smbhs at @xmath0pc scale .",
    "first , the well - known metallicity and luminosity relationship in agns and quasars ( see a review of hamann & ferland 1999 ) strongly implies that the flows may undergo _ fast _ metal productions through stellar evolution in active episodes in light of the absence of cosmic evolution of metallicity ( dietrich et al .",
    "2003 ; shemmer et al .",
    "this gets supports from evidence that there is intensive star formation with the top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) within @xmath1pc in the galactic center ( paumard et al .",
    "2006 ; nayakshin & sunyaev 2005 ) confirmed by numerical simulations ( nayakshin et al . 2007 ;",
    "bonnell & rice 2008 ; hobbs & nayakshin 2009 ) .",
    "we may naturally postulate that accretion onto smbhs is the consequence of metal production .",
    "second , it has long been known that accretion disks in quasars are massive and self - gravitating in outer regions ( paczynski 1978 ; kolykhalov & sunyaev 1980 ; shlosman & begelman 1987 ; collin & zahn 1999 ) .",
    "obviously , the self - gravity is driving intensive star formation ongoing there ( goodman 2003 ) , and a star - forming ( sf ) disk ( or regions ) appears .",
    "it seems that there is no way to avoid the production of metals and trigger accretion flows in the sf disk , yielding the metallicity  luminosity relationship .",
    "we argue that snexp plays a leading role in the establishment of the relationship in light of snexp - excited turbulent viscosity as shown in the @xmath0kpc regions by numerical simulations ( wada & norman 2002 ; hobbs et al .",
    "2010 ) or physical motivation ( wang et al . 2009b ; see also kumar & johnson 2010 ) and @xmath2 sloan type 2 agns ( chen et al . 2009 ) .",
    "furthermore , we are inspired by the recent evidence for that the `` visible '' inflows displayed by the h@xmath3 line are likely developed from the inner edge of the dusty torus in @xmath4 5000 sloan quasars ( hu et al .",
    "2008a,2008b ) .",
    "all clues merge into a question : are accretion inflows driven by star formation in the massive self - gravitating disk ?    in this letter , we show the feasibility that an sf disk is able to drive a shakura  sunyaev disk ( hereafter ss disk ) in agns through snexp - excited turbulent viscosity .",
    "we find that such a scenario agrees with observations of metallicity and results in the formation of a nuclear star cluster potentially",
    ".     0.2 cm",
    "figure 1 shows an illustration of the present model .",
    "the outer boundary of the sf disk ( @xmath5 ) is chosen at the inner edge of the torus as suggested by hu et al .",
    "( 2008a,2008b ) , where dust particles are sublimated at @xmath6 pc , where @xmath7 erg  s@xmath8 ( barvainis 1987 ) .",
    "the option of @xmath9 is motivated by a fact that emission from @xmath10 is invisible in optics .",
    "collisions of molecular clouds transfer angular momentum outward and supply gas to the sf disk with a rate of @xmath11 at @xmath12 from the torus ( krolik & begelman 1988 ) with a typical mass range of @xmath13 ( mor et al .",
    "this typical mass is just at the level required by a single episode of smbh activity .      with the inclusion of the mass dropout from star formation and the injection of gas recycled from snexp ,",
    "the mass conservation equation for the sf disk reads is at @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the hydrogen main - sequence lifetime of stars depending on the stellar mass .",
    "since stars form in the same gaseous disk , the stellar disk always follows the latter in the current model .",
    "unless the stellar disk was formed in the previous episode , it could be larger than the gaseous disk , leading to reduce the feedback efficiency significantly ( nayakshin et al .",
    "@xmath16^{-1 }       \\frac{\\partial \\calg}{\\partial r}\\right\\}-\\sigsfr+\\dot{\\sigma}_{\\rm sn},\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the surface density , @xmath18 is the viscosity torque , @xmath19 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath20 is the angular velocity , @xmath21 is the surface density of star formation rates , and @xmath22 is the injection rate of gas recycled from snexp .",
    "we use the relation @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the fraction of the snexp - ejected mass to the total formed stars . for an episodic activity of agn with @xmath25 ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2006 ) , the minimum mass of the stars producing an snexp should be @xmath26 , where the lifetime of hydrogen main - sequence stars is @xmath27gyr and @xmath28 . assuming an imf as @xmath29",
    ", we have @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the total mass of the formed stars .",
    "it follows @xmath32 for the salpeter imf @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , meaning that a significant mass fraction of the formed stars will be injected into the sf disk from snexp ( here we neglect the remnant compact stars after snexp ) .",
    "the scale influenced by an snexp is of the order of @xmath36 pc , where @xmath37 is the kinetic energy of snexp , @xmath38 is the number density of the medium in the sf disk , @xmath39 cm  s@xmath8 is the isothermal sound speed , and @xmath40k is the temperature .",
    "we find from this simple estimation that the length of the snexp influence is comparable with the height of the sf disk ( @xmath1 pc ) and the snexp - excited turbulence velocity @xmath41 , and hence snexp plays a key role in the transportation of angular momentum .    in this letter , we focus on the stationary case , namely , @xmath42 . introducing the parameter @xmath43 , equation ( 1 ) is rewritten as @xmath44 where the kennicutt  schmidt ( ks ) law @xmath45 is used for simplicity in the entire sf disk ,",
    "@xmath46 is a constant , and @xmath47 is the index ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "lynden - bell & pringle ( 1974 ) show that @xmath48 at any radius , where @xmath49 is the mass rate of the inflows , provides the inner and outer boundary conditions .",
    "we employ the @xmath50-prescription viscosity as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a constant , @xmath53 is the turbulence velocity driven by snexp , and @xmath54 is the thickness of the disk ( wada & norman 2002 ; wang et al .",
    "the energy equation of the snexp excited turbulence is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the timescale of the turbulence , @xmath57 is the efficiency of converting kinetic energy of snexp into turbulence , and @xmath58 is the density of snexp rates . here @xmath59 is a number fraction of stars to the total mass of the formed stars , which are able to produce snexp during one agn episode . for a given imf , we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath33 . considering @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 following paczynski ( 1978 ) , we assume that gas rotates with a keplerian velocity @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the gravity constant and @xmath67 is the smbh mass .",
    "a vertical equilibrium holds among the disk self - gravity , smbh gravity , and turbulent pressure .",
    "we usually have @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the turbulence pressure and the second term is the self - gravity . since the star formation supports the thickness of the sf disk , the self - gravity can be neglected ( thompson et al .",
    "2005 ) , allowing us to have an approximation form of vertical - averaged structure , @xmath70 we point out that the above equations are actually averaged in the vertical direction , and the parameters obtained in these equations are the values at the mid - plane of the sf disk .",
    "the @xmath71 relation is specified for further simplification of equation ( 2 ) through the viscosity @xmath19 . with the help of equations ( 3)-(5 )",
    ", we have @xmath72 yielding an analytical solution in the form of @xmath73 where @xmath74^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath75 for the keplerian rotation , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are two constants determined by the boundary conditions . at the outer radius of the sf disk , only the mass injection rate is known and given by the mechanism of molecular cloud collisions ( krolik & begelman 1988 ) .",
    "we have @xmath78 , namely , @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "we assume that the inner radius of the sf disk is set to be the self - gravity radius ( @xmath81 ) of the ss disk , which depends on the smbh accretion rates ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this yields @xmath83 , and subsequently @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "the self - gravity instability develops when the toomre s parameter @xmath86 . for the ss disk",
    ", the instability happens in the middle region of the ss disk at the radius @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the schwartzchild radius , @xmath89 is the light speed , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 is the eddington luminosity , and @xmath93 is the viscosity parameter in the ss disk ( see kato et al .",
    "we assume that the sf process quenches within @xmath81 , and the sf disks smoothly switch on the ss disks at @xmath81 in term of surface density .",
    "the surface density of the ss disks is @xmath94 where @xmath95 , giving rise to the expression of the condition ( @xmath96 ) of switching from the sf regions to the ss disk @xmath97 it is trivial to get the prolix expression of @xmath76 and @xmath77 from equations ( 9 ) and ( 12 ) , but we omit them here .",
    "we insert @xmath76 and @xmath77 into equation ( 8) for the structure of the sf disk . given @xmath5 and @xmath98 , we can justify if the sf disk is able to drive the ss disk through solving equations ( 8) , ( 9 ) , ( 12 ) .",
    "the accretion rates of the ss disk as well as the structure of the sf disk are obtained self - consistently .",
    "the empirical ks law @xmath45 is used , where @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath21 and @xmath17 are in units of @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "we employ @xmath103erg , a top - heavy imf index @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 ( in light of @xmath109 ) throughout the paper .",
    "we take the outer radius @xmath110 pc and @xmath111 , but adjust two parameters @xmath57 and @xmath98 to demonstrate the final accretion rates of smbhs .",
    "figure 2@xmath112 shows that the inflow driven by snexp holds at a level of @xmath113 at the self - gravity radius ( @xmath114 pc ) for @xmath115 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that an sf disk is able to drive an ss disk .",
    "figure 2@xmath116 plots @xmath21 along the radial direction .",
    "we find that there is a peak of @xmath21 in the sf disks before switching on an ss disk .",
    "this is caused by the star formation and the radial transportation of gas that compete along radii . from the second term of equation ( 7 )",
    ", there is a cutoff of @xmath21 and then an sf disk switches on an ss disk .",
    "figure 2@xmath76 displays a smooth transition of the surface density from sf disks to ss disks .",
    "the bumps in figure 2@xmath76 are artificially made by the assumption for simplicity that there is no star formation in the ss disk .",
    "this assumption roughly holds since the temperature within @xmath81 could be high enough to efficiently suppress star formation .",
    "the right column of figure 2 shows a dependence of the structure on @xmath57 for fixed @xmath117 .",
    "we find that @xmath82 increases with @xmath57 , which appears in the exponential as shown in equation ( 7 ) .",
    "for @xmath118 , the accretion rates are about 5%-10% @xmath117 from @xmath119 .",
    "the fraction @xmath120 of the snexp kinetic energy will be used to heat the gas of the sf disk , and then star formation is quenched close to the middle regions of ss disks .",
    "the output of this energy appears in the infrared bands in spectral energy distributions .",
    "figure 3 shows the dependence of accretion rates on the global star formation rates , defined by @xmath121 . for a fixed @xmath57",
    ", we find @xmath122 , where @xmath123 insensitive to @xmath117 .",
    "0.2 cm it is necessary for agns and quasars to switch the sf disks from the middle region of the ss disks .",
    "we find that for lower @xmath117 the sf disks only support the outer region of the ss disk .",
    "in such a case , the sf disk may drive an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) to smbhs .",
    "excellent examples of this case could be the galactic center , some elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , m87 ) , and liners , where star formation exhausts most of gas forming an adaf as discussed by tan & blackman ( 2005 )",
    ". we would like to point out that @xmath3 used here is only an intermediate top - heavy imf .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath124 ( maness et al .",
    "2007 ) and @xmath125 ( bartko et al . 2010 ) in the galactic center .",
    "metals are ejected through snexp enhancing the metallicity in the sf disk .",
    "the mass of the metal element @xmath126 produced by snexp is given by @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the ejected mass of the element@xmath126 dependent on the initial mass and metallicity of progenitor stars ( woosley & weaver 1995 ; gavilan et al .",
    "et al . 2005 ) . with the @xmath129 , the total ejected metal",
    "is then calculated by @xmath130 . for simplicity , we take an approximation of the metal fraction @xmath131 ( woosley & weaver 1986 )",
    ".    detailed calculations of metallicity involve evolution of stellar populations in the sf disk , advection of metal - enriched gas , and star formation , which make a strong radial dependence of metallicity complicated . however , we study the mean metallicity @xmath132 , as the observed , in the sf disk by introducing @xmath133 and @xmath134 . considering the radial dependence of metallicity ,",
    "@xmath135 will be swallowed by smbhs while @xmath136 is consumed by star formation .",
    "the lower limit of metallicity at radius @xmath137 is roughly given by @xmath138 , and we have @xmath139 from figure 2(@xmath112 ) , where the ( sub / super ) script `` in '' means the values of parameters at the inner edge of the sf disk , and @xmath140 is the local sf rates .",
    "on the other hand , its upper limit is @xmath141 , where we use @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "so we have @xmath144 if the mean @xmath145 .",
    "the parameter @xmath146 for @xmath147 .",
    "the total mass of the metal by time @xmath148 through integrating the net increase of metals is given by @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the initial metallicity of the gas supplied from the torus .",
    "the first term in the integration is contributed by the initial metal of supplied gas , the second is contributed by snexp , the third is advected into smbh and the last one is the consumption of metals during star formation . the total gas of the sf disk is given by @xmath151 .",
    "we obtain the metallicity at time @xmath148 by its definition of @xmath152 @xmath153 this is an integral - differential equation , which is easy to understand in light of @xmath132 as an integral parameter with time . for a steady sf disk , its total mass is a constant , but metals are increasing . after some algebraic manipulations , we have its solution @xmath154 where @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 is assumed initially . for a time",
    "long enough , the last term will tend to zero , we have @xmath158 where @xmath159 , @xmath160 is used , @xmath82 is in units of @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 insensitive to @xmath67 for @xmath115 .",
    "the approximation is valid only for @xmath164 .",
    "we assume for a comparison with observational data that most of quasars reach the state with maximum metallicity , but the episodic age of quasars can be estimated from equation ( 14 ) if the metallicity is measured accurately enough .",
    "figure 4 shows a comparison of the model with data .",
    "not only the metal - rich phenomenon in quasars is explained , but also the _ z  l _ relation is reproduced by the present model .",
    "the large scatters of the _ z  l _ relation imply different @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath165 individually .",
    "the present model may predict the formation of nuclear star clusters commonly found in local galaxies .",
    "they are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude brighter than globular clusters ( ct et al .",
    "2006 ) , have extended star formation histories ( rossa et al .",
    "2006 ) , complex morphologies ( seth et al .",
    "2006 ) , and follow the relation similar to the magorrian relation ( ferrarese et al . 2006 ) . though the sf disk discussed here is only on a scale of 1 pc , sf",
    "is ongoing inside the torus at a few 10 pc scale ( collin & zahn 1999 ) , which is invisible due to dust extinction .",
    "since agn types are irrelevant to orientations of their host galaxies ( e.g. , munoz marin et al . 2007 ) , smbhs are randomly fed by the dusty torus .",
    "this is evidence for random accretion onto the smbhs , which is derived from the @xmath166-equation ( wang et al .",
    "2009a ) and is confirmed by calculations based on the semi - analytical theory of mergers ( li et al .",
    "one stellar belt with random direction composed of old stars is left after one episodic activity accordingly .",
    "the appearance of the nuclear star cluster could be a natural consequence of the multiple episodes of smbh activities ( wang et al .",
    "2008 ; wang et al .",
    "the clusters are thus tightly related to the central smbhs in the present model .",
    "figure 3 suggests that a mass ratio of smbh and a nuclear star cluster is roughly 0.01 - 0.1 depending on @xmath57 and @xmath3 ( i.e. , star formation history ) , consistent with the observations ( seth et al .",
    "detailed comparison with observed properties of the clusters , such as radial - dependent metallicity , sf history , will provide further clue to understand physics in galactic centers .",
    "all the emission from the sf disk will be thermalized with a typical temperature of @xmath167k in the near - infrared band , where @xmath168 is the stefan  boltzman constant , @xmath169 is the snexp luminosity .",
    "it then contributes a fraction to the observed infrared emissions in quasars , which is worth investigating further .",
    "we show that an sf disk supplied by the dusty torus is able to support an ss disk around smbhs in agns and quasars .",
    "such a model naturally produces the observed relationship between metallicity and luminosity . as a natural consequence of the multiple episodes of activity through random accretion onto the holes",
    ", a nuclear star cluster will be formed from the remnants of stellar disks .",
    "the present model would provide a unified explanation of feeding smbhs , production of metallicity , and formation of a nuclear star cluster .",
    "we stress that the present paper deals with the stationary structure of sf disks switching to ss disks . a time - dependent model will give the evolution of agns driven by the sf disks for the complicated agn  starburst connection .",
