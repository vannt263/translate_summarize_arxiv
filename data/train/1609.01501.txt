    "we confine ourselves to the case of weak optical field and low carrier densities , in which it is justified to work in the subspace of single - exciton excitations ( spanned by the so - called exciton basis ) and truncate the carrier branch of the hierarchy of equations for density matrices retaining only contributions up to the second order in the optical field .",

    "the classification is straightforward only for the noninteracting heterojunction ( @xmath23 ) , in which case any exciton state can be classified into four groups :    * both the electron and the hole are in the donor ( donor exciton state ) , * both the electron and the hole are in the acceptor ( acceptor exciton state ) , * the electron is in the acceptor , while the hole is in the donor ( space - separated exciton state ) , * the electron is in the donor , while the hole is in the acceptor .",

    "[ fig : fig3]a .",
    "the population of cs excitons builds up during the action of the electric field , so that after the first 100 fs of the calculation cs excitons comprise 7.6% of the total exciton population , see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]a .",
    "in the remaining 900 fs , when the dynamics is governed by the free hamiltonian , the population of cs excitons further increases to 9.6% .",
    "similar , but less extreme , situation is also observed in the relative number of ct excitons , which at the end of the pulse form 14% of the total population and in the remaining 900 fs of the computation their number further grows to 24% .",
    "therefore , if only free - system evolution were responsible for the conversion from donor to ct and cs excitons , populations of ct and cs states at the end of the pulsed excitation would assume much smaller values than we observe .",
    "we are led to conclude that the populations of ct and cs excitons on ultrafast ( @xmath0-fs ) time scales are mainly established by direct optical generation .",
    "transitions from donor to ct and cs exctions are present , but on this time scale are not as important as is currently thought .",
    "charge separation can also be monitored using the probabilities @xmath28 [ @xmath29 that an electron ( a hole ) is located on site @xmath26 at instant @xmath27 , as well as the probability @xmath30 that an electron is in the acceptor at time @xmath27 ( precise definitions are given in the methods section ) .",

    "[ fig : fig3]b .",
    "it increases , however , more rapidly during the action of the electric field than after the electric field has vanished : in the first 100 fs of the calculation , it increases from virtually 0 to 0.070 , while in the next 100 fs it only rises from 0.070 to 0.104 and at the end of the computation it assumes the value 0.210 .",
    "the observed time dependence of the probability that an electron is located in the acceptor further corroborates our hypothesis of direct optical generation as the main source of separated carriers on ultrafast time scales .",
    "the rationale behind the direct optical generation of space - separated charges is the resonant coupling between donor excitons and ( higher - lying ) space - separated states , which stems from the resonant mixing between single - electron states in the donor and acceptor modulated by the electronic coupling between materials , see the level alignment in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b .",
    "this mixing leads to higher - lying ct and cs states having non - negligible amount of donor character and acquiring non - zero dipole moment from donor excitons ; these states can thus be directly generated from the ground state .",
    "it should be stressed that the mixing , in turn , influences donor states , which have certain amount of space - separated character .    * impact of various model parameters on ultrafast dynamics . *",
    "our central conclusion was so far obtained using only one set of model parameters and it is therefore important to check its sensitivity on system parameters .",
    "we start by investigating the effect of the electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor @xmath32 .",
    "higher values of @xmath32 favour charge separation , since the relative numbers of ct and cs excitons , together with the probability that an electron is in the acceptor , increase , whereas the relative number of donor excitons decreases with increasing @xmath32 , see fig .",

    "stronger electronic coupling between materials leads to stronger mixing between donor and space - separated states , i.e. , more pronounced donor character of ct and cs states and consequently larger dipole moment for direct creation of ct and cs states from the ground state .",

    "[ fig : fig2]b .",
    "the smaller is @xmath22 , the greater is the number of virtually resonant single - electron states in the donor and in the acceptor and therefore the greater is the number of ( higher - lying ) ct and cs states which inherit non - zero dipole moments from donor states and may thus be directly excited from the ground state .",
    "this manifests as larger number of ct and cs excitons , as well as larger probability that an electron is in the acceptor , with decreasing @xmath22 .",

    "while increasing @xmath37 has virtually no effect on the relative number of donor excitons , it leads to an increased participation of cs and a decreased participation of ct excitons in the total exciton population .",
    "ct states , in which the electron - hole interaction is rather strong , are mainly formed from lower - energy single - electron states in the acceptor and higher - energy single hole states in the donor .",
    "these single - particle states are not subject to strong resonant mixing with single - particle states of the other material .",
    "however , cs states are predominantly composed of lower - energy single - hole donor states and higher - energy single - electron acceptor states ; the mixing of the latter group of states with single - electron donor states is stronger for larger @xmath38 , just as in case of smaller @xmath22 , see fig .  [ fig : fig2]b .",
    "therefore , dipole moments for direct generation of cs excitons generally increase when increasing @xmath38 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5]c , whereas dipole moments for direct generation of ct excitons at the same time change only slightly , which can account for the trends of the participation of cs and ct excitons in figs .  [ fig : fig5]a , b .",
    "we also studied the effects of the carrier - phonon interaction on the ultrafast dynamics at heterointerfaces .",
    "varying the strength of the carrier - phonon interaction over rather wide interval is found to weakly affect the ultrafast exciton dynamics , see supplementary fig .",
    "1 . stronger carrier - phonon interaction leads to smaller number of ct and cs excitons , as well as the probability that an electron is in the acceptor ; the magnitudes of the changes observed are , however , rather small . in previous studies  @xcite , which did not deal with the initial exciton generation step ,",
    "stronger carrier - phonon interaction is found to suppress quite strongly the charge separation process",
    ". weak influence of carrier - phonon interaction strength on ultrafast heterojunction dynamics that we observe supports the mechanism of ultrafast direct optical generation of space - separated charges .",
    "if charge separation process at heterointerfaces were mainly driven by the free system evolution , greater changes in the quantities describing charge separation efficiency would be expected with varying carrier - phonon interaction strength .",
    "varying the ratio @xmath39 of the carrier - phonon coupling constants is found to affect populations of strongly - bound ct states and has little influence on the number of cs excitons , see supplementary fig .",
    "our formalism takes into account the influence of phonons on excitons .",
    "however , if this influence were too strong , the hierarchy of equations would have to be truncated at a higher level , which would make it computationally intractable .",
    "when the effects of lattice motion on excitons are strong , one has , in turn , to consider the feedback of excitons on phonons , which is not captured by the current approach .",
    "the feedback of excitons on lattice motion can be easily included in mixed quantum / classical approach , where excitons are treated quantum mechanically , while lattice motion is treated classically . to estimate the importance of the feedback of excitons on lattice motion , we have performed the computation using the surface hopping approach  @xcite ( see supplementary note 3 for more details ) . in supplementary fig .",
    "5 we show the time dependence of the probability that an electron is in the acceptor obtained from simulations with and without feedback effects .",
    "the result is nearly the same in both cases , suggesting that feedback effects are small . as a consequence ,",
    "our approach is sufficient for properly taking into account the influence of phonons on excitons .    to summarize this part ,",
    "we find that regardless of the particular values of varied model parameters ( @xmath40 , carrier - phonon coupling constants ) , the majority of ct and cs states which are present @xmath1 fs after photoexcitation has been directly generated during the excitation . trends in quantities describing ultrafast heterojunction dynamics that we observe varying model parameters can be explained taking into consideration the proposed mechanism of ultrafast direct optical generation of space - separated charges .    * spectroscopy signatures . * exciton dynamics on ultrafast time scales",

    "to understand the origin of this apparent difference , we numerically simulate ultrafast pump - probe experiments in the framework of our heterojunction model . to achieve this goal",
    ", we extended our two - band lattice semiconductor model including more single - electron ( single - hole ) energy levels per site .",
    "multiple single - electron ( single - hole ) levels on each site should be dipole - coupled among themselves in order to enable probe - induced dipole transitions between various exciton states ( see supplementary note 2 for more details ) .",
    "we have derived an analytic expression which relates the differential transmission @xmath41 to the nonequilibrium state of the system `` seen '' by the probe pulse .",
    "the expression is presented in the methods section and is further motivated in supplementary note 1 . in brief , it provides a very clear and direct interpretation of the results of ultrafast pump - probe experiments and allows to distinguish between contributions stemming from exciton populations and coherences , challenging the existing interpretations .    in figs .",

    "the overall signal shape is qualitatively similar to the shape of donor exciton pia signal in fig .",
    "4(a ) of ref .  , but its interpretation is rather different . while the authors of ref .   suggest that the monotonically increasing pia signal from donor excitons reflects their transfer to space - separated states , our signal predominantly originates from coherences between donor states and the ground state ( @xmath43-part of the signal in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7]c ) .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the total signal matches very well the decay of the coherent population of the lowest donor exciton , while the shape of the @xmath44-part of the signal corresponds well to the changes in the incoherent population of the lowest donor state , see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7]d .",
    "this incoherent population does not decay during our computation : immediately after the pump pulse it rises and at longer times it reaches a plateau , which signals that the donor exciton population is `` blocked '' in the lowest donor state .",
    "the lowest donor exciton is very strongly dipole - coupled to the ground state , its population comprising around 75% of the total generated population .",
    "therefore , according to our numerical results , the observed pia signal from donor excitons in this case mimics the conversion from coherent to incoherent exciton population of the lowest donor state .",
    "this conversion is rather slow because of the relatively weak coupling between low - lying donor excitons on the one hand and space - separated states on the other hand ( this weak coupling was also appreciated in ref .  ) . on the other hand ,",
    "pumping well above the lowest donor and space - separated states , the couplings between these species are stronger and more diverse than for the pump resonant with the lowest donor exciton ; this situation resembles the one encountered for the excitation condition in fig .",
    "4(c ) of ref .  .",
    "to conclude this section , our computations yield the spectra which overall agree with experimental spectra  @xcite , and we find that the shape of the spectrum in figs .  [",
    "fig : fig7]c , d originates from the decay of coherences between donor exciton and the ground state , rather than from transition from donor exciton to space - separated states .",
    "we studied ultrafast exciton dynamics in one - dimensional model of a heterointerface .",
    "even though similar theoretical models have been lately proposed  @xcite , we believe that our theoretical treatment goes beyond the existing approaches , since it treats both the exciton generation and their further separation on equal footing and it deals with all the relevant interactions on a fully quantum level .",
    "namely , the vast majority of the existing theoretical studies on charge separation at heterointerfaces does not treat explicitly the interaction with the electric field which creates excitons from initially unexcited system  @xcite , but rather assumes that the exciton has already been generated and then follows its evolution at the interface between two materials .",
    "if we are to explore the possibility of direct optical generation of space - separated charges , we should certainly monitor the initial process of exciton generation , which we are able to achieve with the present formalism .",
    "we find that the resonant electronic coupling between donor and space - separated states not only enhances transfer from the former to the latter group of states  @xcite , but also opens up a new pathway to obtain space - separated charges : their direct optical generation  @xcite .",
    "while this mechanism has been proposed on the basis of electronic structure and model hamiltonian calculations ( which did not include any dynamics ) , our study is , to the best of our knowledge , the first to investigate the possibility of direct optical generation of separated charges studying the ultrafast exciton dynamics at a heterointerface .",
    "we conclude that the largest part of space - separated charges which are present @xmath1 fs after the initial photoexcitation are directly optically generated , contrary to the general belief that they originate from ultrafast transitions from donor excitons .",
    "the ultrafast generation of separated charges at heterointerfaces is more pronounced when the electronic coupling between materials is larger or when the energy overlap region between single - electron states in the donor and acceptor is wider , either by increasing the electronic coupling in the acceptor or decreasing the lumo - lumo offset between the two materials , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b",
    ". our results are therefore in agreement with studies emphasizing the beneficial effects of larger electronic couplings among materials  @xcite , charge delocalization  @xcite and smaller lumo - lumo offset  @xcite on charge separation .",
    "in contrast to previous studies  @xcite , we find that the carrier - phonon interaction does not have strong influence on ultrafast heterojunction dynamics , which we interpret to be consistent with ultrafast direct optical generation of space - separated charges .    moderate static disorder is seen not to change the essential physics of free hole and electron generation , see supplementary fig .",

    "ultrafast exciton dynamics at a heterojunction exhibits weak temperature dependence , see supplementary fig .",
    "3 , which is consistent with existing theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite insights , and also with the mechanism of direct optical generation of space - separated carriers .    despite a simplified model of organic semiconductors ,",
    "our theoretical treatment takes into account all relevant effects .",
    "consequently , our approach to ultrafast pump - probe experiments produces results which are in qualitative agreement with experiments and confirms the previously observed dependence of the exciton dynamics on the excess photon energy  @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that the interpretation of ultrafast pump - probe signals is involved , as it is hindered by coherences ( dominantly by those between exciton states and the ground state ) which can not be neglected on the time scales studied .",
    "time scales on which coherent features are prominent depend on the excess photon energy .",
    "we find that higher values of the excess photon energy enable faster disappearance of the coherent part of the signal since they offer diverse transitions between exciton states which make conversion from coherent to incoherent exciton populations faster .",
    "pumping at the lowest donor exciton , our signal is ( at sub - ps pump - probe delays ) dominated by its coherent part , conversion from coherent to incoherent exciton populations is slow , and therefore it can not be interpreted in terms of exciton population transfer between various states .",

    "probabilities @xmath28 [ @xmath29 that an electron ( a hole ) is located at site @xmath26 at instant @xmath27 can be obtained using the so - called contraction identities ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) and are given as @xmath94 @xmath95 consequently , the probability that an electron is in the acceptor at time @xmath27 is @xmath96    * theoretical treatment of ultrafast pump - probe experiments . * in a pump - probe experiment , the sample is firstly irradiated by an energetic pump pulse and the resulting excited ( nonequilibrium ) state of the sample is consequently examined using a second , weaker , probe pulse , whose time delay with respect to the pump pulse can be tuned  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the pump - probe spectroscopy is an example of nonlinear optical techniques related to the third - order optical polarization and the corresponding third - order optical susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that this third - order optical polarization is of the second order in the pump field and linear in the probe field  @xcite . therefore ,",
    "our formalism , which deals only with contributions up to the second order in the pump field , when combined with recent theoretical results for the nonequilibrium dipole - dipole response function  @xcite , should be suitable to theoretically investigate ultrafast pump - probe spectroscopy .    as mentioned in the results section , in order to study pump - probe spectra , keeping at the same time the numerics manageable , we iterated our model by introducing only one additional single - electron level both in the donor and in the acceptor and one additional single - hole level in the donor .",
    "additional energy levels in the donor and the corresponding bandwidths are extracted from the aforementioned electronic structure calculation on the infinitely long pcpdtbt polymer .",
    "additional single - electron level is located 1160 mev above the single - electron level used in all the calculations and the bandwidth of the corresponding zone is estimated to be 480 mev .",
    "additional single - hole level is located 1130 mev below the single - hole level used in all the calculations and the bandwidth of the corresponding zone is estimated to be 570 mev .",
    "additional energy level in the acceptor is extracted from an electronic structure calculation on the c@xmath97 molecule .",
    "the calculation is based on dft using either lda or b3lyp exchange - correlation functional ( both choices give similar results ) and 6 - 31 g basis set and was performed using the nwchem package  @xcite .",
    "we found that the additional single - electron level lies around 1000 mev above the single - electron level used in all the calculations .",
    "bandwidth of the corresponding zone is set to 600 mev , see table  [ tab : model_params ] .",
    "we limit ourselves to the case of the probe pulse acting after the pump pulse and assume that the probe pulse is ultrashort ( deltalike ) and that our system satisfies the condition of optical thinness  @xcite . under these assumptions , the part of the differential transmission signal which accounts for pia ( transitions from an excited state to another excited state under the action of the probe pulse ) is given as    @xmath98    in the last equation , @xmath99 are dipole matrix elements for the generation of an exciton in the state @xmath78 directly from the ground state , @xmath100 are dipole matrix elements describing transitions from exciton state @xmath78 to exciton state @xmath101 ( see also supplementary note 2 ) , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are previously introduced electronic density matrices taken at the moment when the probe acts , and @xmath104 is a positive infinitesimal which effectively accounts for the line broadening .",
    "time delay @xmath105 between the probe and the end of the pump is taken into account in equation   through electronic density matrices @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( which depend on @xmath105 ) , while @xmath106 is the frequency of the probe . in actual computations of pump - probe spectra",

    "coherent contributions are explicitly separated introducing the correlated part of exciton populations and exciton - exciton coherences @xmath110 .",
    "first two summands in equation   stem from exciton coherences with the ground state and form @xmath43-part of the total signal , while the third summand originates from correlated part of exciton populations and exciton - exciton coherences and is thus @xmath44-part of the total signal .",

    "<S> we present detailed investigation of ultrafast ( sub - ps ) exciton dynamics in the lattice model of a donor / acceptor heterojunction . </S>",
    "<S> exciton generation by means of a photoexcitation , exciton dissociation , and further charge separation are treated on equal footing . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed presence of space - separated charges at @xmath0 fs after the photoexcitation is usually attributed to ultrafast transitions from excitons in the donor to charge transfer and charge separated states . here , we show , however , that space - separated charges appearing on @xmath0-fs time scales are predominantly directly optically generated . our theoretical insights into the ultrafast pump - probe spectroscopy challenge usual interpretations of pump - probe spectra in terms of ultrafast population transfer from donor excitons to space - separated charges .    </S>",
    "<S> past two decades have seen rapidly growing research efforts in the field of organic photovoltaics ( opvs ) , driven mainly by the promise of economically viable and environmentally friendly power generation  @xcite . in spite of vigorous and interdisciplinary research activities , </S>",
    "<S> there is a number of fundamental questions that still have to be properly answered in order to rationally design more efficient opv devices . </S>",
    "<S> it is commonly believed  @xcite that photocurrent generation in opv devices is a series of the following sequential steps . </S>",
    "<S> light absorption in the donor material creates an exciton , which subsequently diffuses towards the donor / acceptor ( d / a ) interface where it dissociates producing an interfacial charge transfer ( ct ) state . </S>",
    "<S> this interfacial state further separates into free electron and hole ( the so - called charge separated ( cs ) state ) , which are then transported to the respective electrodes . on the other hand , several recent spectroscopic studies  @xcite have indicated the presence of spatially separated electrons and holes on ultrafast ( @xmath0 fs ) time scales after the photoexcitation . </S>",
    "<S> these findings challenge the usual picture of free - charge generation in opv devices as the following issues arise . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) it is not expected that an exciton created in the donor can diffuse in such a short time to the interface since the distance it can cover in 100 fs is rather small compared to the typical size of phase segregated domains in bulk heterojunctions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the mechanism by which a ct state would transform into a cs state is not clear . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy of a ct exciton is rather large  @xcite and there is an energy barrier preventing it from the transition to a cs state , especially at such short time scales .    to resolve question ( ii ) , many experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies have challenged the implicit assumption that the lowest ct state is involved in the process . </S>",
    "<S> these studies emphasized the critical role of electronically hot ( energetically higher ) ct states as intermediate states before the transition to cs states . </S>",
    "<S> other studies suggested that electron delocalization in the acceptor may reduce the coulomb barrier  @xcite and allow the transition from ct to cs states . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results of vandewal et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , who studied the consequences of the direct optical excitation of the lowest ct state , suggest that the charge separation can occur very efficiently from this state . to resolve issue ( i ) , it has been proposed that a direct transition from donor excitons to cs states provides an efficient route for charge separation  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> all the aforementioned studies implicitly assume that an optical excitation creates a donor exciton and address the mechanisms by which it can evolve into a ct or cs state on a @xmath1 fs time scale . </S>",
    "<S> in this work , we demonstrate that the majority of space - separated charges that are present @xmath1 fs after photoexcitation are directly optically generated , in contrast to the usual belief that they originate from optical generation of donor excitons followed by some of the proposed mechanisms of transfer to ct or cs states . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in a recent theoretical work ma and troisi  @xcite concluded that space - separated electron - hole pairs significantly contribute to the absorption spectrum of the heterojunction , suggesting the possibility of their direct optical generation </S>",
    "<S> . a similar conclusion was also obtained in most recent work of davino et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these works , however , do not provide information about relative importance of direct optical generation of space - separated charges in comparison to other hypothesized mechanisms of their generation . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the time evolution of populations of various exciton states during and after optical excitation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we numerically investigate the ultrafast pump - probe spectroscopy and find that the signal on ultrafast time scales is dominated by coherences rather than by state populations . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the interpretation of the experimental spectra in terms of state populations rather difficult . </S>"
