    "the observations with the ir camera isaac ( moorwood 1997 ) were carried out in the first half of 2001 in service mode which was chosen to ensure that the ambient conditions meet our specifications , in particular the seeing demand . the narrow  band imaging in the 2.09 @xmath0 m filter was performed in polarimetric mode , i.e. , with the wollaston prism and the slit mask in the optical train .",
    "the dithering positions were chosen to achieve the full coverage of the field  of  view ( fov ) .",
    "furthermore , these images served as continuum which had to be subtracted from the br@xmath1 and h@xmath2(10)s1 narrow  band frames . for the data reduction we developed a general pipeline applicable to imaging data obtained by isaac .",
    "the pipeline is written in the high  level idl language , offering automated reduction together with the opportunity of flexibility .",
    "the aims of the measurements were as follows :    * images in continuum filters ( 2.09 @xmath0 m , l@xmath3 , nb_m ) to study the distribution of stars from the most massive to solar  type ones . * narrow  band imaging in br@xmath1 ( 2.166 @xmath0 m ) and br@xmath4 ( 4.07 @xmath0 m ) to deduce the amount and distribution of dust extinction .",
    "* images in the h@xmath2(10)s1 line ( 2.122 @xmath0 m ) to search for shocks caused by winds and outflows from young stellar objects ( ysos ) .    here ,",
    "we show some results for two selected regions of high  mass star formation .",
    "together with recent interferometric radio data , they demonstrate that high  resolution observations are required to overcome the confusion arising from the complexity of massive star formation .",
    "g9.62 + 0.19 is a complex of massive star formation regions ( d@xmath55.7 kpc ) .",
    "it comprises several ysos in different evolutionary stages .",
    "an age gradient spans from western ( older ) to eastern ( younger ) regions ( hofner et al .",
    "the site harbours an hot molecular core ( hmc ) , i.e. , a very dense , warm and compact condensation of molecular gas ( cesaroni et al . 1994 ) .",
    "nir emission was found at the location of the hmc ( testi et al .",
    "1998 ) , in contradiction of hmc standard models ( osorio et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the superior sensitivity and resolution of the new isaac data ( vlt archive data for the filters j , h and ks as well as our thermal infrared and nir narrow  band data ) lead to new conclusions : + * high resolution * ( seeing 04  06 ) * : * an intriguing substructure of the hmc region f has been revealed ( decomposition into 3 ir objects , see fig .",
    "* highly accurate astrometry : * the peak positions of the hmc radio emission and of the strongest nir peak in component f do not coincide ( fig .",
    "1 ) . a foreground nir star ( f2 ) at the hmc position fades at longer wavelengths .",
    "however , another source becomes apparent nearby ( f4 in fig .",
    "1 ) which seems to be intrinsically associated with the hmc . +",
    "* working hypothesis : * the finding of a pole  on molecular outflow probably driven by the hmc ( hofner et al .",
    "2001 ) explains at least qualitatively why we can see at all thermal ir emission from the hmc  we benefit from the outflow s clearing effect .",
    "+ * still discussions : * contrary to de buizer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we find that also the compact 10-micron source found in the hmc region by several authors corresponds to the hmc .",
    "it is identical with object f4 ( see fig .",
    "+ furthermore , there are localised regions of br@xmath1 and h@xmath2 emission as well as of reflected nir continuum within g9.62 + 0.19 ( fig .",
    "3 ) which demonstrates the complex structure of this region also on a larger scale .",
    "+ the results of a comprehensive ir study about this star  forming region and its hmc will be given in linz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "this region , which contains a deeply embedded iras source in its centre , is associated with the herbig ",
    "haro objects hh80/81 and hh80-north ( d@xmath61.7 kpc ) .",
    "an ir reflection nebula surrounds the more enshrouded inner region .",
    "the central object was finally detected in the mid - ir ( stecklum et al . 1997 ) .",
    "mart et al .",
    "( 1993 ) revealed a large and well  collimated thermal radio jet emanating from the central source .",
    "this jet  driving source is a prime candidate for the search of an accretion disk around a newly formed massive star . + our new isaac nir narrow - band and thermal infrared data show the nebula and its power source in unprecedented detail : the reflection nebula exhibits a bipolar morphology ( fig .",
    "4 ) , the entire structure is roughly aligned along the ne  sw direction of the jet . a large fraction of the extended emission consists of scattered light .",
    "localised spots of h@xmath2 emission ( presumably due to shocks ) exist . with the vla",
    ", we found a 7-mm emission peak , indicative of thermal dust emission , that is coincident with the embedded jet  driving source and offset from nir features ( figs . 4 and 5 ) . in the thermal infrared",
    ", the driving source finally becomes visible ( fig .",
    "5 ) . with our new isaac data",
    "we could detect it for the first time at a wavelength as short as 3.8 @xmath0 m .",
    "as a result of our isaac observations , several southern high  mass star  forming regions could be investigated in greater detail than before .",
    "the large degree of complexity has been revealed .",
    "we could show that the actual interesting sources often remain invisible in the near  infrared due to their deep embedding in the dense gas and dust configurations of the natal molecular clouds .",
    "therefore , imaging in the thermal infrared turned out to be extremely useful to trace these seclusive objects .",
    "hence , multi ",
    "wavelength data sets were pivotal to get the whole picture .",
    "accurate astrometry could be applied which has a great impact on the interpretation of the data .",
    "one of the lessons learned is that the relation between infrared and radio emission is sometimes not as clear  cut as it might seem .",
    "thus , careful and detailed investigations like the presented isaac campaign are crucial for the deeper understanding of the mechanisms of massive star formation .",
    "however , the isaac results represent only an intermediate step .",
    "still higher resolution is required to study all the details of massive star formation  a task for powerful adaptive optics systems on telescopes of the 8-m class .",
