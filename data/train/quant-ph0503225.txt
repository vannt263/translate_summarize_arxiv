    "in previous publications  @xcite , an objective description of a quantum system in the time interval between two complete measurements has been proposed in terms of _ two _ state vectors , together with a new type of physical quantity , the  weak value \" of a quantum mechanical observable .",
    "specifically , for a system drawn from an ensemble preselected in the state @xmath0 and postselected in the state @xmath1 , the weak value for the observable @xmath2 is defined as @xmath3 where the real part is the quantity of primary physical interest ( and to which the term  weak value \" shall henceforth apply unless otherwise noted ) .",
    "the suggestion was motivated operationally by the fact that both real and imaginary parts of weak values can be linked to conditional measurement statistics predicted by standard quantum mechanics for the general class of  weak measurements \" , defined so as to minimize the disturbance to the system as a result of a diminished interaction with the measuring instrument . under these conditions ,",
    "joint weak measurements of two non - commuting observables can be made with negligible mutual interference , thus ensuring that the simultaneous assignment of weak values to all elements of the observable algebra is operationally consistent .",
    "the usefulness of this description has been demonstrated , both theoretically and experimentally , in a number of applications in which novel aspects of quantum processes have been uncovered when analyzed in terms of weak values .",
    "these include photon polarization interference  @xcite , barrier tunnelling times  @xcite , photon arrival times  @xcite , anomalous pulse propagation  @xcite , correlations in cavity qed experiments  @xcite , complementarity in  which - way \" experiments  @xcite , non - classical aspects of light  @xcite , communication protocols  @xcite and retrodiction  paradoxes \" of quantum entanglement  @xcite .    a certain amount of skepticism  @xcite has nevertheless prevailed regarding the physical status of weak values , particularly in the light of the unconventional range of values that is possible according to  ( [ weakvdef ] ) .",
    "indeed , the real part of @xmath4 , describing the  pointer variable \" response in a weak measurement , may lie outside the bounds of the spectrum of @xmath2 .",
    "manifestly  eccentric \" weak values , as are negative kinetic energies  @xcite or negative particle numbers  @xcite , are not easily reconciled with the physical interpretation that is traditionally attached to the respective observables .",
    "less intuitive yet is when @xmath2 stands for a projection operator , in which case the weak value suggests  weak probabilities \" taking generally non - positive values  @xcite .",
    "such bizarre interpretations call for a sharper clarification of what physical meaning should be attached to the weak value of an observable .",
    "another item of skepticism surrounding the physical significance of weak values has to do with their general domain of applicability .",
    "it seems reasonable to demand of any new physical concept that it be applicable to a wide variety of situations outside the restricted context in which it is defined operationally .",
    "although progress has been made in this direction  @xcite , convincing evidence of the general validity of the concept of the weak value is still lacking .    with these questions in mind , the aim of this paper is two - fold : first , we address the physical meaning of weak values by showing that there exists an unambiguous interpretation of the real part of the weak value as a _",
    "definite _ mechanical effect of the system on a measuring probe that is specifically designed to minimize the dispersion in the back - reaction on the system .",
    "second , based on this interpretation , we present a new framework for the analysis of general von neumann measurements , in which the measurement statistics are interpreted as _ quantum averages of weak values _ ( qawv ) .",
    "we believe this framework is physically intuitive and provides compelling evidence for the ubiquity of weak values in more general measurement contexts .",
    "in particular , we show that for arbitrary system ensembles , the expectation value of the reading of any von neumann - type measurement is an average of weak values over a suitable posterior probability distribution .",
    "we furthermore show how qawv framework has a natural correspondence in the classical limit with the posterior analysis of measurement data according to the classical inference framework .",
    "thus , we can establish a correspondence between weak values and what in the macroscopic domain are regarded as objective classical dynamical variables .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ eigvvswv ] , we motivate the idea of averaging weak values by discussing the connection between pre - selected and pre- and postselected statistics in arbitrary measurements von - neumann type measurements . in sec .",
    "[ mechint ] we present the operational definition of the weak value as a definite mechanical effect associated with infinitesimally uncertain unitary transformations .",
    "the qawv framework is then introduced in sec . [ qaves ] for arbitrary strength measurements .",
    "we provide an illustration in section [ likecc ] , where we discuss a number of measurement situations in which the framework gives a simple characterization of the outcome statistics .",
    "finally , we establish in sec .",
    "[ clas ] the classical correspondence of the qawv framework .",
    "some conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "the conventional interpretation of a quantum mechanical expectation value , such as @xmath5 for an observable @xmath2 , is as an average of the eigenvalues of @xmath2 over a probability distribution that is realized in the context of a complete strong measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "our main suggestion in this paper is that for a wide class of generalized conditions on the von neumann measurement of @xmath2 , the statistics of measurement outcomes can alternatively be related to an underlying statistics of a different quantity , the weak value of @xmath2 , which is to be regarded as a definite physical property of an unperturbed quantum system in the time interval between two complete measurements .",
    "we shall therefore begin by discussing in this preliminary section the connection between pre- and pre - and post - selected measurement statistics of arbitrary strength von neumann measurements , and from this discussion show an instance in which averages of weak values more aptly describe the posterior break - up of the measurement outcome distribution .    in the von neumann measurement scheme  @xcite ,",
    "the device is some external system , described by canonical variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath8=i$ ] ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the system - device interaction is designed so that the measurement result is read - off from the effect on some designated device  pointer variable \" , which we take to be @xmath7 . for a measurement of the system observable @xmath2 at the time @xmath10",
    ", this interaction is modelled by the impulsive hamiltonian @xmath11 ( note that a possible coupling constant can always be absorbed by canonically redefinig @xmath12 and @xmath13 . )",
    "the effect of the measurement is then described by the unitary operator @xmath14 .",
    "since we will only be concerned with the effect of this interaction from times immediately before to immediately after @xmath15 , we shall henceforth assume the all additional free evolution is already contained in the states .",
    "we first consider the pointer variable statistics from an ensemble defined by pure initial conditions on the system and the apparatus , described by states @xmath0 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "for later convenience , we shall term this ensemble the _ preselected measurement ensemble _ ( pme ) @xmath17 .",
    "further , we introduce the notation @xmath18 or @xmath19 to denote times immediately before or immediately after the measurement time @xmath15 .",
    "now , for the pme @xmath17 , the effect of the measurement interaction is easily described by the heisenberg picture transformation @xmath20 induced by the evolution operator @xmath21 . since the initial system plus apparatus state is separable , the final statistics of the pointer variable are easily obtained from the spectral decomposition of @xmath2 , and are given by the probability distribution @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the projector onto the eigenspace of the system hilbert space with eigenvalue @xmath25 . in this description",
    ", a  strong \" or projective measurement corresponds to the limit @xmath26 , ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) , in which case the pointer distribution mimics the spectral distribution of the born interpretation , @xmath28 .",
    "note however that even if the spectrum can not be resolved , the resulting expression  ( [ prestats ] ) for the pointer statistics can still be interpreted as if , on every single trial , the pointer variable is displaced in proportion to one of the eigenvalues of @xmath2 , with the eigenvalues distributed randomly throughout the sample according to @xmath29 .",
    "thus , _ regardless _ of the form of @xmath30 the mean and variance of the distribution  ( [ prestats ] ) will always satisfy @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the variance in @xmath13 of the state @xmath16 and we have assumed @xmath33 for simplicity .",
    "= 2.65truein    now suppose that after time @xmath15 , a postselection is performed on the system , and we wish to concentrate on the subset of measurement outcomes arising only from those systems that ended up in some specific state , @xmath34 .",
    "this final condition defines for us a subensemble @xmath35 of the pme @xmath17 , that we call a _ pre- and post- selected measurement ensmble _ ( ppme ) , the measurement statistics of which can be obtained from the conditional final state of the apparatus@xcite @xmath36 where the normalization @xmath37 is shorthand for the transition probability @xmath38 ( i.e. , the average relative size of the ensemble @xmath35 ) . from this state ,",
    "the corresponding pointer variable distribution is given by @xmath39 .",
    "let us briefly discuss some relations between the pme and ppme statistics .",
    "suppose the postselection involves a complete measurement of some non - degenerate observable @xmath40 , with eigenstates @xmath41 .",
    "a pooling of the data from all the subensembles @xmath42 of @xmath17 must then yield the preselected distribution ( eq .",
    "( [ prestats ] ) ) , in other words @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the relative size of each ppme .",
    "two important consequences follow from this decomposition : first , the pme expectation value of the pointer @xmath45 breaks up in a similar fashion as @xmath46 ; assuming that the prior expectation value of @xmath13 vanishes , this entails the sum rule @xmath47 i.e , the weighted average of the ppme pointer expectation values has to yield the standard expectation value of @xmath2 .",
    "a second consequence of  ( [ pooldist ] ) is a  covering \" condition satisfied by the individual ppme distributions , @xmath48 for all values of @xmath13 and all final outcomes@xmath49 .",
    "this imposes a constraint on how rare a ppme @xmath50 should be were the corresponding @xmath51 to be peaked somewhere in the tail region of @xmath52 .",
    "the relevance of  ( [ avesumrule ] ) and  ( [ covercond ] ) is that indeed the weight of a ppme measurement outcome distribution need not lie within the  normal \" region of expectation defined by the bounds of the spectrum of @xmath2 ( fig.[fig : poolings ] ) , contrary to what one would have naively expected given the generality of the spectral expansion of the pme distribution  ( [ prestats ] ) .",
    "this may not be obvious under strong measurement conditions , such that when the appartus wave function in @xmath13 is expanded as a superposition of shifted wave functions @xmath53 the overlap between two shifted functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 for all @xmath56 is negligible .",
    "indeed , in such a case , the resulting p.d.f .",
    "for the pointer variable takes the form of a mixture of  strong \" measurement distributions , i.e. , @xmath57 , each centered at one of the eigenvalues of @xmath2 with weights given by the aharonov , bergmann and liebowitz rule for projective measurement sequences  @xcite ; the weight of this distribution is , of course , within the bounds of the spectrum of @xmath2 .",
    "however , away from strong measurement conditions @xmath58 will involve interference terms between the shifted wave functions @xmath59 with coefficients @xmath60 that are not generally real nor positive - definite , preventing the resolution of the individual shifted peaks and allowing for destructive interference effects that may place the weight of @xmath61 beyond the spectrum of @xmath2 .    for a wide class of wave functions of the apparatus ,",
    "weak values emerge from the limiting behavior of these interference effects in a complementary limit to that of strong measurement conditions  @xcite , namely when @xmath12 , the conjugate to the pointer variable , satisfies @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath64 , one obtains the weak value as the limiting conditional expectation value @xmath65 this limiting behavior is furthermore accompanied by the limit @xmath66 , as if indeed no measurement had taken place , justifying the term  weak limit \" .",
    "hence , in this limit the posterior break - up  ( [ pooldist ] ) of the pme pointer distribution is essentially that of a mixture of distributions , each of which is centered at the weak value defined by its corresponding final state in the post - selection and weighted by the corresponding ( unperturbed ) transition probability .",
    "thus we have an instance in which the expectation value of @xmath2 is more appropriately interpreted operationally as an average of weak values than as an average of eigenvalues .",
    "indeed , it is easily verified that the weighted average of the weak values defined by a complete post - selection is the standard expectation value of @xmath2 @xmath67 as expected from the sum rule  ( [ avesumrule ] ) .",
    "note that this is a _ classical _ averaging process , as it arises from the mixing of the distributions conditioned on the distinguishable outcomes of the post - selection .",
    "the sum rule  ( [ avewvs ] ) embodies a general rule of thumb , namely that _  eccentric weak values are unlikely \" _ , according to which weak values lying outside the spectrum of @xmath2 must be weighted by correspondingly small relative probabilities , ensuring that the average over all pre- and postselected subensembles yields a quantity within the spectral bounds of @xmath2 .",
    "this generic property of weak values is at the heart of the qawv framework presented in section  ( [ qaves ] ) , where we show that pre - and post - selected statistics away from weak measurement conditions can also be interpreted from a _",
    "quantum _ averaging process involving weak values .",
    "implicit in the suggestion that standard expectation values can be interpreted ( at least under certain conditions ) as averages of weak values , is the idea that weak values are in some sense  sharp \" physical properties .",
    "we therefore expand on this notion of  sharpness \" by giving an operational sense in which the weak value can indeed be regarded as a definite mechanical property of a system that is known to belong to an enesemble defined by complete pre- and post - selections .",
    "the functional dependence on @xmath12 of the transition amplitude @xmath68 in  ( [ statetransf ] ) furnishes the necessary elements to build a description of the ppme statistics based on a picture of  action and reaction \" , in which , if the variable @xmath12 is sharply defined , then a ) the measured system is subject to a sharply - defined unitary transformation generated by @xmath2 , and b ) the measuring apparatus suffers a sharply - defined response given by the weak value of @xmath2 .",
    "this elementary picture serves the basis for the more general qawv framework discussed in the following section .",
    "let us look at the polar decomposition of @xmath69 , which we choose to express as @xmath70 where @xmath71 ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) gives the transition probability from @xmath72 to @xmath34 , but mediated by an intermediate unitary transformation @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the variable @xmath12 can be regarded as the parameter of a back - reaction on the system , generated by the operator @xmath2 , inducing the transformation of the initial state @xmath74 ( alternatively , the reaction can be viewed as the inverse transformation @xmath75 on the final state @xmath34 ) . on the other hand , the phase factor in  ( [ polardecomp ] ) can be viewed as the generator of a certain reaction of the system on the apparatus corresponding to a specific rotation parameterized by @xmath12 : viewed as a unitary operator on the apparatus degrees of freedom , @xmath76 induces in the heisenberg picture the generally nonlinear canonical transformation of the pointer operator @xmath77 where @xmath78 a straightforward derivation then shows that @xmath79 is indeed a weak value @xmath80 namely the weak value of @xmath2 for the rotated state @xmath81 and the final state @xmath34 .",
    "equation  ( [ canshift ] ) therefore shows that for a definite value of @xmath12 , there is an associated definite reaction on the measuring device pointer variable by the weak value for the corresponding pair of states @xmath82 .",
    "more precisely , note that for the general pointer variable statistics for the ppme @xmath35 , eq .",
    "( [ specexp ] ) , we can equivalently express the final apparatus wave function @xmath61 as the fourier integral @xmath83 } \\ , .\\ ] ] let us now suppose that @xmath12 is constrained to lie exclusively within a finite range around some value @xmath84 , by taking @xmath85 to be the  window \" function of width @xmath86 centered at @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath87 in this case the wave function in the @xmath13-representation is a modulated  sinc \" function @xmath88 of characteristic width @xmath89 .",
    "now let @xmath86 be small enough that variations of @xmath90 and @xmath79 are negligible within the interval @xmath91 .",
    "thus , we can approximate @xmath92 , and perform the fourier integral in the  group velocity approximation \" , i.e. , by expanding the phase about @xmath93 to first order and replacing @xmath90 by @xmath94 ; this yields @xmath95 where we define @xmath96 hence , in the limit @xmath97 , where the apparatus wave function approaches an eigenstate of @xmath6 with eigenvalue @xmath93 , the final wave function for the pointer becomes ( up to a phase ) the initial wave function _ rigidly shifted by a definite weak value _ , the weak value @xmath98 for the rotated state @xmath99 and the final state @xmath34 .",
    "from the point of view of the system , the limit @xmath100 can be regarded as an idealization of a situation often encountered in more general contexts , where the evolution of a quantum system is treated as effectively unitary despite the fact that certain parameters of the evolution are actually physical variables of some external ( and typically macroscopic ) system ; for example a spin rotation , where a macroscopic external magnetic field sets the rotation angle . that such parameters can be treated as classical numbers",
    "is a consequence of a negligible uncertainty of the quantum variable of the external system acting as the parameter for the transformation .",
    "the interaction with such an external system may thus be idealized as an _ infinitesimally uncertain unitary transformation _ at a given parameter value .",
    "this idealization provides the desired mechanical definition of weak values : _ the weak value @xmath79 corresponds to a definite conditional reaction of the system on the variable conjugate to the external physical ",
    "parameter variable \" @xmath6 of an infinitesimally uncertain unitary transformation generated by @xmath2 at parameter value @xmath12_. the essence of a weak measurement is thus to approach , as close as possible , the ideal conditions of an infinitesimally uncertain transformation .",
    "the above definition presents no ambiguities in the physical interpretation of  eccentric \" weak values or in the sometimes unexpected relationships that may arise between the weak values of say , @xmath2 and @xmath101 ( e.g. , negative  weak variances \" , etc . ) . to the extent that we associate weak values to infinitesimal unitary transformations , no _ a - priori _ connection between the weak values of two commuting observables",
    "should be expected ; typically , commuting operators such as @xmath2 and @xmath101 generate entirely different types of un unitary transformations .",
    "rather , relations between weak values follow from the _ linear _ , vector space structure of the lie algebra of hermitian operators generating infinitesimal transformations .",
    "the vector space structure is reflected , for instance , in the fact that for any two initial and final states that are eigenstates of the the observables @xmath2 and @xmath40 , with eigenvalues @xmath25 and @xmath49 respectively , the reaction to an infinitesimal unitary transformation generated by the linear combination @xmath102 at @xmath103 is the linear combination @xmath104 .",
    "finally , let us emphasize the significance of the present mechanical interpretation of weak values in connection with certain quantum mechanical operators , such as kinetic energy or particle number  @xcite , for which any association with negative values would appear to be forbidden .",
    "the fact that the reactions associated with weak values will almost always lie within the range of the observable s spectrum is what gives us a reference from which to identify , in those unlikely circumstances where the reaction is  eccentric \" , what are unique quantum - mechanical effects associated with the role of the observable as a generator of infinitesimal transformations .",
    "one would hardly suspect that such effects could indeed be possible given the physical interpretations that we have traditionally attached to the eigenvalues of a quantum mechanical observable .",
    "the framework of quantum averages of weak values ( qawv ) is the extension of the previous analysis to general von neumann measurements , with arbitrary pure initial states of the apparatus not necessarily satisfying a  weakness condition \" .",
    "given a _ pure _",
    "ppme @xmath35 , we shall show how the conditional average of measurement outcomes can nevertheless be interpreted as a quantum average of weak values over a suitable distribution . for more general initial and final conditions on the system ( as well as more general initial conditions on the apparatus ) , the corresponding averages can then be obtained by a classical averaging process , similar to that of  ( [ avewvs ] ) , given that any such ensemble can always be broken - up into complete pre - and postselected measurement subensembles with appropriate relative weights .",
    "the heuristics of the framework are straightforward : a general apparatus pure state @xmath16 entails indefiniteness in the parameter value @xmath12 driving the back - reaction on the system according to  ( [ backreact ] ) , so that a generally finite range of system configurations are sampled in the orbit of transformed initial states @xmath105 .",
    "correspondingly , the pointer measurement statistics should reflect the sampling of a certain range of weak values @xmath106 associated to this orbit .",
    "however , once @xmath12 is allowed to take arbitrary values , a new element in the description comes into play .",
    "this has to do with the relative weights associated with the sampled values of @xmath12 , which reflect a probability - reassessment in the light of the additional conditions entailed by the post - selection .",
    "the central idea of the framework is then that an arbitrary strength von neumann measurement on a pre- and postselected system may be viewed as a superposition of weak measurements at different sampling points @xmath12 , with a re - assessment of the weights of each sample in accordance with bayes theorem .",
    "let us for simpliciity consider an initial apparatus function that is real and smooth .",
    "this function may then be represented as the limit of a superposition of infinitesimally - wide window functions @xmath107 centered at the  sampling points \" @xmath108 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 . from the results of the previous section , and by linearity , the corresponding final apparatus state wave function may be represented as @xmath111 the final apparatus state can therefore be viewed as a superposition of weak measuerements at the sampling points @xmath112 but with the initial weights @xmath113 replaced by new weights @xmath114 . as is easily seen ,",
    "this re - assessment of weights is in correspondance with @xmath115 , the p.d.f . for strong measurements of @xmath12 ( performed either before or after the measurement interaction ) on the ppme @xmath35 . consistently with bayes theorem , @xmath115 is the posterior distribution for @xmath12 after a re - assessment of the prior p.d.f .",
    "@xmath116 by the likelihood @xmath117 of the post - selection given the @xmath12-dependent rotation of the initial state : @xmath118 note that in accordance with the  eccentric weak values are unlikely \" rule of thumb , the likelihood factor @xmath119 will tend to suppress the contributions in the superposition for which the weak value falls outside the spectrum of @xmath2 . as we shall illustrate in the coming section ,",
    "it is this mechanism that ensures , together with quantum mechanical interference , that the strong measurement distributions peaked at the eigenvalues of @xmath2 can nevertheless be understood as a quantum superpositions of weak measurements .",
    "it becomes convenient to capture in compact form the two conceptually different processes involved in the updating of the apparatus state @xmath120 as a result of the measurement .",
    "the first step , the generally irreversible process of probability re - assessment , can be expressed conveniently by defining a fiducial state @xmath121 , which we term the _ re - assessed initial state _ of the apparatus . defining the state by its wave function in @xmath12",
    ", it corresponds to the ( prior ) initial wave function @xmath85 multiplied by the square root of the likelihood factor in  ( [ postdef ] ) : @xmath122 the other process is the reversible mechanical action of the system on the measurement apparatus generated by the unitary operator @xmath123 defined by the polar decomposition  ( [ polardecomp ] ) .",
    "the final conditional state of the measuring device can then be expressed as a unitary transformation applied to the re - assessed state @xmath121 , @xmath124 .",
    "equivalently , one can compute pointer statistics from the heisenberg picture transformation  ( [ canshift ] ) using the apparatus state @xmath121 . in particular , the conditional p.d.f . of pointer readings",
    "can be expressed as a quantum - mechanical analogue of a marginal distribution of shifted pointer values , @xmath125 in other words , as a _ quantum average of weak values _",

    "for the measurement outcomes of the classical function corresponding to @xmath2 on a classical canonical system specified by initial and final boundary conditions in time .    using the heisenberg picture ,",
    "we finally obtain the pointer reading mean and variance for the ppme @xmath35    [ finalmoms ] @xmath126    where the subscripts @xmath127 and @xmath128 stand for expectation values in the state @xmath121 and @xmath129 , and where , the quantum weak value average @xmath130 and variance @xmath131 are directly evaluated using the posterior p.d.f .",

    "note therefore that a condition for a weak measurement that is more general than the one discussed in the previous section is that we have a sharp _ posterior _ p.d.f in @xmath12 around some value @xmath134 , in which case the pointer average reflects a measurement of a sharply - defined weak value @xmath135 with a small uncertainty @xmath131 .",
