    "the majority of the parameters of the standard model , thirteen out of eighteen , originate in the mass matrices of the quarks and charged leptons .",
    "the most promising idea which has led to predictions of some of these flavor parameters is the reduction of parameters made possible by a combination of grand unified symmetries @xcite and flavor symmetries @xcite .",
    "the most successful prediction of any parameter of the standard model is that of the weak mixing angle in supersymmetric grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite : the predicted value of .233@xmath12.002 should be compared with the experimental value of .233@xmath12.001 .",
    "the first flavor parameter to be predicted in guts was @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this prediction is affected by the mass of the heavy top quark and again favors supersymmetric unification.@xcite    recently three of us introduced the most predictive scheme yet constructed for flavor parameters @xcite , based on the family symmetries of georgi and jarlskog @xcite and on supersymmetric guts . including @xmath1 , the ratio of electroweak vevs , there are fourteen flavor parameters , and these are given in terms of only eight gut parameters , yielding six predictions . to obtain these predictions",
    "the yukawa matrices must be scaled with the renormalization group ( rg ) from gut to weak scales .",
    "previously this was done by including the one - loop rg scaling effects induced by gauge and top quark yukawa interactions @xcite .",
    "this is sufficient only for moderate values of @xmath1 , since as @xmath1 is increased , the b and @xmath0 yukawa couplings increase and contribute to the rg scaling .    in this paper",
    "we reanalyze the dhr framework@xcite using the full one - loop rg equations , thus including rg scaling effects induced by the b and @xmath0 yukawa couplings .",
    "there are several reasons for doing this .",
    "previous analyses @xcite showed that @xmath1 can not be less than about two when the strong coupling constant is @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore as @xmath1 is increased so @xmath15 is decreased , improving the agreement with experiment .",
    "it is clearly of great interest to know whether this agreement can be further improved by going to values of @xmath1 outside the range of validity of previous calculations .",
    "furthermore the previous predictions for @xmath2 will be affected by large b and @xmath0 yukawa couplings , which contribute to the rg equation for the t yukawa coupling .",
    "finally , studying the case of large b and @xmath0 yukawa couplings allows the exploration of a particularly simple restriction on the dhr yukawa couplings ; namely that the gut scale b and t yukawa couplings are equal .",
    "the dhr anstze for the three yukawa matrices at the renormalization group scale @xmath16 is @xmath17 below the gut scale , the symmetries which maintained zero entries and preserved the relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath19 are broken .",

    "we stop the rge evolution at a scale @xmath22 . the weak scale quark and lepton mass matrices",
    "are then given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 gev .",
    "these three weak scale yukawa matrices are diagonalized by the unitary matrices @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa [ ckm ] mixing matrix is then given by @xmath33 .",
    "below the weak scale we evolve the fermion masses to one - loop in qed and two - loops in qcd .",
    "we define the resulting mass enhancement factors by @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "the dependence of these mass enhancement factors on the strong coupling constant , shown in figure 1 , has important consequences .",
    "all of the numerical results quoted in this paper are a result of running and diagonalizing the yukawa couplings in matrix form according to the full one - loop rge .",
    "the eight parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 are best determined from the masses and mixing angles ; @xmath40 and @xmath7 .",
    "consider a fixed but arbitrary value of @xmath39 .",
    "since the rg evolution of the yukawa matrix elements can be significantly affected by all three third generation yukawa couplings , the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 must be determined first",
    ". both of these couplings can be reliable determined by the combined constraints of the tau lepton mass and the @xmath43 ratio . since the charged lepton masses are well known and the rge for lepton masses is not complicated by uncertainties in @xmath44 , the couplings @xmath45 and @xmath46 are then very reliably determined by the electron and muon masses .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 can then be fixed by the charm quark mass , @xmath48 set by the up to down ratio , and the phase @xmath49 determined from @xmath50 .",
    "finally two solutions for @xmath39 can be found as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "the smaller branch corresponds to the solution obtained previously@xcite , while the larger branch represents a new solution ( see fig .",
    "once @xmath39 is determined we have a prediction for @xmath9 and the remaining fermion masses and mixing angles ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in figure 4 , we plot the prediction for @xmath9 directly as a function of @xmath7 .    how constrained are the predicted values of @xmath9 and @xmath39 ? having specified @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath44 , choosing a value for @xmath7 in principle determines two discrete values for @xmath39 .",
    "however , over a large range , @xmath39 is a very sensitive function of @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , the relationship between @xmath39 and @xmath7 is affected by uncertainties in @xmath53 and @xmath51 .",
    "hence , until we know the values of @xmath54 and @xmath44 with better precision , @xmath39 is not well determined . for this reason we chose to display our predictions for @xmath39 and @xmath9 as an allowed region where the quantities mentioned above are allowed to vary within the current experimental uncertainties .",
    "moreover , figs .",
    "2(a , b , c ) , 3(a , b , c ) and 4(a , b , c ) show the sensitivity of the predictions to variations in @xmath55 for the three values , .110 , .118 , and .126 .",
    "note , the plots in this paper are for the pole mass of the top quark defined in terms of the running mass by @xmath56    let us now consider the theoretical uncertainty in our predictions due to the experimental / theoretical uncertainty in @xmath55 . although a seemingly precise value of @xmath55 can be obtained by imposing one - loop unification of the three gauge couplings at a single point @xmath16 and evolving the strong coupling down to the weak scale , both gut and weak scale threshold corrections introduce significant theoretical uncertainties in @xmath44 .",
    "we therefore allow @xmath6 to vary over the range @xmath57 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath44 affects the predictions through their dependence on the renormalization factors .",
    "for example at fixed @xmath39 , the square of @xmath7 is proportional to the bottom quark and charm quark yukawa couplings at the scale @xmath58 ( see ref .",
    "so for fixed charm and bottom quark masses .",
    "@xmath59 thus a larger value of @xmath44 , gives a smaller value of @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , @xmath60 grows like @xmath61 .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the solutions at large values of @xmath39 can be understood by appealing to the solutions obtained previously for small values of @xmath39 and by studying the effect of the b - quark yukawa coupling on the running of the @xmath43 ratio . the renormalization group equation for the @xmath0 yukawa coupling does nt depend on the top quark yukawa at one - loop .",
    "so once we specify values of @xmath39 and @xmath55 the gut scale input @xmath42 can be given as a unique function of the parameter @xmath41 by demanding that the tau lepton mass is @xmath62 gev .",
    "will in general depend on @xmath41 because the evolution of the b yukawa coupling , which contributes to the running of @xmath63 , depends on @xmath41 . ] the top quark yukawa coupling can then be determined from the b - quark mass . in general , the top quark yukawa coupling decreases the @xmath43 ratio , and a phenomenologically acceptable ratio requires a large top quark yukawa .",
    "let us now define r as the ratio of the b quark mass to the tau lepton mass .",
    "then @xmath64 where the rg constants @xmath65 are defined in ref .  @xcite .",
    "because @xmath66 is larger than unity for most of the rg evolution , a large @xmath0 yukawa coupling tends to decrease the @xmath43 ratio .",
    ", @xmath67 over the entire range of the rg scale @xmath68 .",
    "] so , as @xmath39 is increased , because @xmath42 must increase to keep the tau mass constant , @xmath43 decreases . since @xmath43 decreases , a smaller top quark yukawa coupling is needed to maintain a fixed @xmath43 ratio .",
    "thus at large values of @xmath39 the top quark yukawa coupling , @xmath41 , decreases and so does @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in addition , as @xmath41 decreases , @xmath7 increases , which results in an upper limit on @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . these relationships can also be seen in fig .",
    "4 which displays the prediction for @xmath9 in terms of @xmath7 .",
    "the smallest values of @xmath7 and largest values of @xmath9 occur for large @xmath44 and small @xmath52 .",
    "however , large values of @xmath44 and small values of @xmath52 require large values for the gut scale top quark yukawa , a. for the range of parameters studied in this paper @xmath69 .",
    "a perturbative one - loop calculation becomes unreliable for larger @xmath44 and smaller @xmath52 .",
    "can we reduce the number of parameters at the gut scale ? in table 1",
    "we give some sample inputs at the gut scale .",
    "0.25 cm    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the large mass hierarchy between similarly charged quarks in different families requires @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "however , since the up and down quarks obtain mass from the vacuum expectation values of different higgs doublets , there is a priori no connection between a , b , c and d , e , f .",
    "an extremely interesting question is whether the number of predictions of the dhr scheme can be increased by arranging for relations between the yukawa couplings of the up and down sectors .",
    "a simple such relation is a = d. this occurs in @xmath72 models which have a single decouplet generating the masses of the third generation provided that both light @xmath73 doublets lie predominantly in this decouplet .",
    "if attention is limited to the heaviest generation , the requirement that the three yukawa couplings are equal at the unification scale leads to a prediction for the top mass @xcite : there are two parameters ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) and three observables .",
    "unfortunately the prediction is very sensitive to @xmath6 : @xmath2 increases from 110 gev to near 180 gev as @xmath6 increases from .10 to .12 .",
    "however , in the dhr framework the third generation parameters can not be treated in isolation , since they affect other observables , such as @xmath15 . setting a = d ,",
    "ie making @xmath1 very large , leads to large values of @xmath15 , as can be seen from figure 2 .",
    "hence a = d is only consistent with large @xmath6 .",
    "this considerably narrows our parameter space : @xmath76 , @xmath77 gev , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "since the number of free parameters has been reduced by one , @xmath3 is now a prediction of the theory rather than an input .",
    "finally , we mention the impact of this framework on radiative electroweak symmetry breaking in supersymmetric theories . recently ,",
    "ananthanarayan , lazarides and shafi have demonstrated that radiative electroweak symmetry breaking can be accomplished in the minimal supersymmetric model when all three third generation yukawa couplings are equal at the gut scale@xcite .",
    "since the dhr framework with @xmath80 tightly constrains @xmath9 and @xmath39 it leads to a very predictive heavy sparticle mass spectrum .",
    "in this paper we have given a general one - loop analysis of the dhr framework .",
    "the results of this work are shown in the figures .",
    "figures 2 and 4 show how the predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 depend on the input @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , figure 2 shows that for any inputs which dhr found led to an acceptable @xmath1 , there is also an additional large @xmath1 solution .",
    "figure 3 shows that this large @xmath1 region always has a top quark mass in the range 185@xmath1210 gev , which is clearly much more restrictive than in the region of lower @xmath1 .",
    "the figures also provide an illustration of how the predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 depend on the inputs @xmath4 , @xmath5 and especially @xmath6 .",
    "it is because of the uncertainties in the values of these inputs that @xmath1 can vary so much .",
    "it is worth stressing that increasing @xmath81 from .110 to .126 can reduce @xmath2 from 170 gev to 126 gev .    restricting the dhr framework by imposing a relationship between the yukawas of the up and down sectors , namely setting a = d , produces a scheme where the fourteen flavor parameters are predicted with just seven inputs . in this case",
    "@xmath15 is no longer an input , but is predicted by the theory .",
    "this very predictive scheme can only be correct if @xmath6 and @xmath15 are both large and if @xmath82 gev .",
