    "single photon sources are of great interest for various applications in quantum information , in particular quantum cryptography ( e.g.@xcite ) . in recent years",
    "colour centres in diamond have proven the potential to fulfill the requirements for practical single photon sources such as room temperature operation , photostability and high brightness .",
    "nitrogen - vacancy ( nv)-centres @xcite , nickel based ne8 centres @xcite , nickel - silicon complexes @xcite , chromium related colour centres @xcite as well as silicon - vacancy ( siv)-centres @xcite have been employed as single photon sources .",
    "the majority of the experiments has been performed on nv - centres as they are easily available in single - crystal diamond @xcite and in nano - diamonds @xcite , either produced during the growth process or by ion implantation .",
    "in addition , due to the extraordinary long spin coherence times , key experiments towards quantum information processing have been realized with nv - centres , e.g. two - qubit quantum - gates @xcite or quantum registers based on nv spins @xcite .",
    "however , nv - centres possess the detrimental property of a room temperature emission width of about 100 nm due to strong phonon - coupling . +    , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    silicon - vacancy ( siv-)centres were suggested as an alternative to nv - centres due to their narrow zero - phonon - line ( zpl ) width of 5 nm at room temperature , their low phonon - coupling @xcite , as well as their feasible creation by ion implantation or during chemical vapour deposition ( cvd)-growth @xcite .",
    "a further advantage is their emission in the near infrared at 738 nm in a spectral region where background fluorescence of the surrounding diamond material is weak .",
    "first single emitter experiments on siv - centres created by ion implantation in natural diamonds @xcite , however , revealed unfavourable low single photon emission rates of the order of only 1000 counts / s , despite a short lifetime of 1.2 ns .",
    "radiative quantum yields of only 0.05 were found for siv - centres in cvd - films @xcite and were explained by temperature dependent non - radiative transitions , indicated by a strong increase in the luminescence intensity for temperatures below 100 k @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the luminescence of siv - centres is quenched by the presence of graphite @xcite , thus defining the need for high purity diamonds .",
    "+ the structure of the siv - centre has been intensively investigated : it most probably consists of a silicon atom and a lattice vacancy arranged in a so called split - vacancy - configuration , where a substitutional silicon atom relaxes its position towards a neighbouring vacancy @xcite as illustrated in figure [ sivstruct ] .",
    "photoluminescence excitation measurements suggest a position of the ground state of the centre 2.05 ev below the conduction band edge @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy of high quality single - crystalline diamond at cryogenic temperatures reveals a fine structure of the ensemble zpl consisting of four lines @xcite .",
    "a level scheme including a split excited state with components separated by 242 ghz and a split ground state with components separated by 48 ghz with four allowed optical transitions ( see figure [ sivstruct ] ) was proposed to account for the observed fine structure @xcite .",
    "this fine structure has never been observed for single siv - centres so far .",
    "+ in this study we present an advanced material system for single emitter spectroscopy of siv - centres : we employ a microwave - plasma assisted cvd - growth on nano - diamond seeded iridium substrates to yield high quality nano - diamonds .",
    "single siv - centres are produced in situ during the cvd - growth due to the presence of silicon impurities .",
    "nano - diamonds exhibit superior properties as hosts for single photon sources as the fluorescence can be efficiently collected due to the lack of total internal reflection at the diamond - air interface @xcite .",
    "we note that efficient collection of photons can also be achieved using nano - structures in single - crystal diamond , e.g diamond nano - wires @xcite .",
    "a further advantage of nano - diamonds is a low fluorescence background due to the small diamond volume in the excitation laser focus .",
    "the iridium substrate provides optimized properties for our application : first of all , the metal substrate exhibits an extremely low fluorescence background . secondly , spectroscopy on diamond films grown on iridium substrates did not reveal any substrate specific luminescence in our experiments , thus we conclude that growth on iridium does not lead to substrate related colour centres . as a consequence , mostly luminescence - free nano - diamonds are produced .",
    "furthermore , incorporation of the heavy element iridium into the dense crystal lattice of diamond is expected to be disfavoured as compared to many lighter elements ( like b , n , si ) due to its high atomic radius , enabling growth of high purity nano - diamonds . finally , the iridium layer has the potential to alter significantly the radiative properties of the colour centres : in the presence of a metal layer the electromagnetic field of an emitting dipole interacts both with the metal via near field coupling and with the dipole itself via radiation back - action @xcite .",
    "the resulting effects include reduction of excited - state lifetimes , enhanced excitation probabilities , as well as enhanced collection efficiency due to radiation pattern modification , and depend critically on the distance of the emitter to the metal layer .",
    "such effects have been investigated in detail for various single emitters e.g. single molecules @xcite or single cdse - quantum - dots @xcite .",
    "nano - diamonds were grown on substrates consisting of a 150 nm thick iridium layer deposited onto a 40 nm thick buffer layer of yttria - stabilized zirconia on silicon @xcite . for the growth process",
    "10x10 mm@xmath0 substrates were used .",
    "prior to the seeding procedure the substrates were cleaned in permonosulfuric acid and rinsed in purified distilled water to remove possible contamination .",
    "the seeding procedure employed an aqueous solution of fully de - agglomerated synthetic nano - diamonds ( microdiamant liquid diamond msy ) with sizes up to 30 nm which was spin coated onto the substrates .",
    "the size distribution of the seed nano - diamonds as measured by the manufacturer is displayed in figure [ seedsizehist ] : the maximum of the distribution is approximately 17 nm , with a full width at half maximum of about 12 nm . by diluting the solution we are able to conveniently tune the seed density attained by the spin coating .",
    "for the investigated samples the solution was diluted to contain approximately 0.6 mg of diamond per litre solution .",
    "the seed density estimated from scanning - electron - microscope ( sem ) images is roughly 2.5 seeds per @xmath1m@xmath0 . +",
    "the seeded substrates were subjected to a microwave plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition process for 25 min . a hydrogen - methane plasma containing 1 % of methane at a gas pressure of 30 mbar and a microwave power of 2000 w was employed .",
    "siv - centres are created during the cvd - growth due to the presence of silicon impurities originating from the plasma exposure of the silicon substrates at the cut edges of the samples .",
    "regarding the origin of silicon impurities it can not be excluded that the plasma in contact with the quartz wall of the reactor etches and transfers some additional silicon to the gas phase .",
    "however , etching of reactor walls and incorporation of silicon can be controlled to a large extend by the size of the plasma ball or the composition of the gas phase @xcite . on the other hand , if silicon is used as a substrate we observe the formation of ensembles of siv - centres in isolated nano - diamonds , similar to the findings of @xcite , but never single siv - centres . in this case , the efficient creation of siv - centres is attributed to the plasma etching of the exposed substrate @xcite .",
    "thus , we assume that the silicon substrate is the major source of silicon impurities for the growth on the iridium layer system as well .",

    "figure [ ndsempics](a ) displays an overview of an 8x6 @xmath1m@xmath0 area of the sample , confirming the growth of isolated nano - diamonds with a density of 1.7 - 2.2 cvd - nano - crystals per @xmath1m@xmath0 , slightly lower than the estimated seed density .",
    "detailed images ( figure [ ndsempics ] ( b ) ) reveal well faceted nano - diamonds .",
    "the nano - diamonds show various crystal orientations , reproducing the different orientations of the seed crystals @xcite . in principle however , the iridium layers provide an additional option due to their unique properties as heteroepitaxy substrate for diamond(001 ) @xcite and diamond(111 ) films @xcite : synthesis of epitaxial diamond nano - crystals on iridium would yield siv - centres residing in a well - aligned diamond matrix , giving rise to a reproducible and well - defined orientation of the colour centre dipole . +    by analyzing the sem images we obtain the size distribution of the nano - diamonds displayed in figure [ ndsizeshist ] .",
    "we identify a mean size of the crystals of 130 nm with a standard deviation of 40 nm .",

    "is observed in 50x50 @xmath1m@xmath0 thus enabling feasible single emitter characterization .      to analyze the nano - diamond fluorescence",
    "we use a confocal microscope setup . as excitation source",
    "a 671 nm frequency doubled dpss laser focused through a microscope objective with na=0.8 is employed . by using a dichroic beamsplitter and dielectric filters the fluorescence in the spectral range of 730 - 750 nm is separated from reflected laser light and coupled into a multimode fibre simultaneously serving as pinhole for the confocal setup .",
    "the fluorescence is directed to a hanbury - brown - twiss setup ( hbt ) employing two avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) ( perkin elmer spcm - aqrh-14 ) to measure the intensity autocorrelation g@xmath2 of the emitted photons .",
    "+ for spectral characterization the fluorescence is analyzed by a grating spectrometer ( horiba jobin yvon , ihr 550 ) .",

    "0.18 ( 0.06 ) nm , respectively .",
    "taking into account the quantum efficiency of the apds ( typically @xmath3 ) , the solid angle fraction corresponding to the na of the objective and the transmission of the optical components we estimate an overall detection efficiency of @xmath4 . to facilitate single emitter characterization at cryogenic temperatures",
    "a flow cryostat ( janis research , st-500ln ) operated with liquid helium is used .",
    "confocal scans of the samples reveal nano - diamonds with bright luminescence in the spectral range 730 - 750 nm .",
    "a histogram of the observed lines is shown in figure [ histemitters ] .",
    "for the histogram crystals containing single and multiple colour centres were taken into account .",
    "the measured line positions spread from 732 nm to 748 nm , although the majority of the observed colour centres shows a zpl between 736 and 740 nm . from investigations of poly - crystalline diamond films , ensembles of siv - centres",
    "are known to exhibit a room temperature line - width of 6 nm with a temperature independent inhomogeneous line - width of up to 4.4 nm @xcite , depending on film quality .",
    "thus the inhomogeneous broadening of the siv - centre emission explains most of the observed spread of the line positions .",

    "figure [ rtzpl ] displays spectra of the zpls of these centres .",
    "the peak positions are ranging from 737.6 nm to 740.9 nm .",
    "emitter ( 2 ) exhibits an asymmetric line shape , which is fitted best by introducing three lines at the positions listed in table [ overviewempar ] .",
    "remarkably , all colour centres display a room temperature zpl line - width of less than 2.2 nm .",
    "emitter ( 3 ) shows a line - width of only 0.7 nm , which is to our knowledge the narrowest room temperature line - width measured for a diamond colour centre up to now .",
    "thus the line - widths obtained are comparable to ne8 centres ( 1.2 nm @xcite , 1.5 nm @xcite ) delivering the narrowest line - widths so far and superior to the line - widths observed for single siv - centres in former studies ( 5 - 7 nm @xcite ) . the observed narrowing of the zpls compared to former studies might be related to the broadening mechanisms involved : as described e.g. in @xcite the width of the zpl at room temperature is determined by homogeneous broadening due to electron - phonon scattering induced by a quadratic electron - phonon interaction .",
    "this broadening relates to the phonon density of states which critically depends on local lattice distortions .",
    "such local variations are visible e.g. in varying phonon - sideband spectra as discussed below .",

    "the latter rate , to our knowledge , is the highest photon count rate observed for a single colour centre in diamond up to now , surpassing recently investigated single photon sources based on chromium colour centres delivering a maximum of 3.2 mcps @xcite .",

    "the enhancement compared to the count rates for siv - centres in bulk diamond is not exclusively explained by the enhanced fluorescence extraction efficiency from the nano - crystals compared to bulk diamond which has been measured to enhance the fluorescence rate by a factor of 11 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the good crystalline quality of the nano - diamonds as observed in sem - investigations might lead to enhanced fluorescence properties if non - radiative processes are suppressed .",
    "additionally , the presence of the iridium layer influences the fluorescence properties by narrowing the emission cone of the colour centres thus enhancing the collection efficiency @xcite .",
    "the iridium layer might also lead to a weak enhancement of the radiative decay rates of the colour centres as well as a significant enhancement of the non - radiative decay rates due to near field coupling and absorption ( see section [ g2modelling ] ) . as these effects depend critically on the distance of the emitting dipole from the metal layer they vary with the unknown position of different emitting colour centres inside our nano - diamonds of around 130 nm size , thus contributing to the spread in count rates .",
    "in addition , the undefined dipole orientation of the colour centres gives rise to changes in the collection efficiency : for the microscope objective employed ( na=0.8 ) the collection efficiency varies by a factor of 2.4 for dipoles oriented perpendicular and parallel to the optical axis of the microscope objective @xcite .",
    "finally , as discussed in section [ g2modelling ] the observed colour centres also exhibit different population dynamics including the participation of shelving states leading to different brightness .",
    "+ the investigated emitters did not show blinking , nevertheless emitter ( 4 ) was permanently photo - bleached after approximately one and a half hour of observation , when applying high excitation power to perform the saturation measurement .",
    "if a change in the charge state was responsible for the bleaching , enhanced stability might be gained by controlling the surface termination of the nano - diamonds as shown for nv - centres @xcite .",
    "another route might be enlarging the nano - diamond size to reduce surface effects .",
    "these approaches are currently under investigation",
    ". +      the polarization properties of the colour centres play a crucial role in their use as single photon sources : if the colour centre preferentially absorbs linearly polarized light one can optimize the excitation by choosing the fitting linear polarization , thus gaining signal to background ratio .",

    "this behaviour is basically observed for emitters ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) , although the contrast does not reach @xmath25 .",
    "the deviation is mainly due to polarization changes induced by the dichroic beam splitter : for s and p - polarization the dichroic mirror does not change the polarization of the laser light , whereas for light polarized at 45@xmath26 we observe a loss of linear polarization degree of @xmath27 .",
    "thus the depolarization due to the beam splitter might give an explanation for the reduced visibility for emitters ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) , yielding evidence for single dipole behaviour in excitation .",
    "however , as the visibility amounts only to @xmath3 and @xmath28 for emitters ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) the contribution of a second dipole to the excitation as e.g observed for the nv - centre @xcite can not be excluded .",
    "+ for the emitted fluorescence similar experimental considerations hold : when passing the dichroic mirror polarization angle dependent rotation and loss of linear polarization occur .",
    "these effects have been qualitatively observed for reflected laser light .",
    "further investigations have to reveal whether the loss in linear polarization degree is due to an elliptical polarization as stated in @xcite .",
    "thus , due to depolarizing effects , we do not expect to observe @xmath25 visibility even for fully linear polarized emission .",
    "furthermore , as a consequence of the angle dependent polarization rotation effects , the polarization angle measured behind the dichroic mirror differs from the polarization angle of the emitted light .",
    "in addition to the depolarizing effects in the detection path , we have to take into account a loss of polarization contrast due to imaging with a high na objective @xcite : the polarization visibility of a single dipole depends critically on its orientation : for a dipole with its axis perpendicular to the optical axis of the microscope @xmath25 visibility is theoretically obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "for a dipole with its axis parallel to the optical axis of the microscope objective no net contrast is obtained as the polarization is not constant over the collimated fluorescence beam ( polarization anisotropy ) . as the orientation of the nano - diamonds on the sample is random , the orientation of individual siv - centre dipoles is random as well . thus , we are in principle not able to determine whether a polarization contrast deviating from @xmath25 is due to the orientation dependent loss of contrast or due to a possible contribution of a second dipole moment .",
    "+ in our experiments on polarization contrast of siv - fluorescence three emitters ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) show high visibilities of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "on basis of the experimental considerations described above we can assume that these emitters show close to @xmath25 visibility of the emitted light , thus evidencing single dipoles oriented approximately perpendicular to the optical axis of the setup .",
    "the measured visibility of emitter ( 2 ) amounts only to @xmath32 .",
    "here we can not distinguish whether the dipole is oriented at an angle between 0 and 90@xmath33 to the optical axis or a second dipole contributes to the transition . to our knowledge",
    "the nature of the electronic states of the siv - centre is still subject to debate @xcite and no investigations on dipoles contributing to transitions of the siv - centre are reported in literature .",
    "thus this topic needs further investigation .",
    "+      to prove the single emitter behaviour and to analyze the population dynamics of the investigated colour centres measurements of the g@xmath0 function for different excitation powers have been performed .",

    "the bunching signature is intensity dependent , becoming more pronounced for higher excitation powers : for emitter ( 1 ) g@xmath0 values exceeding 10 are measured .",
    "the measurements also reveal differences in this bunching behaviour for the emitters : while for emitter ( 1 ) bunching becomes only visible for excitation well above saturation all other emitters exhibit photon bunching already for lower power .",
    "the time constants governing the bunching behaviour show a large variation among the emitters : the g@xmath0 function of emitter ( 4 ) decays to a value of one for time delays of less than 50 ns even at low power , while for emitters ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) time constants of more than 1 @xmath1s are observed for low power , decreasing to below 100 ns for high excitation power .",

    "this non - radiative decay channel varies with local strain in different nano - diamonds @xcite .",
    "second , the excited state lifetime is modified by the presence of the metal layer . to estimate this influence",
    "we perform three - dimensional finite - difference time domain calculations ( fdtd solutions , lumerical ) . to simplify the problem we assume an emitting dipole in a semi - infinite diamond slab ( refractive index @xmath51 ) above a semi - infinite iridium layer ( @xmath52 at 740 nm @xcite ) . as the orientation of the emitting dipole is unknown",
    "we simulate a dipole parallel to the iridium layer as a first estimate .",
    "the influence of the metal layer can be divided into two regimes : at distances @xmath53 ( @xmath54155 nm in diamond for the investigated colour centres ) the lifetime usually shows an oscillatory behaviour due to far - field interaction of the dipole with its mirror image @xcite .",
    "we disregard this regime as the diamond nano - crystals have a mean size of 130 nm and the emitter - metal - distance thus is @xmath55 130 nm . in figure [ simulationresults ]",
    "we present results for the radiative and non - radiative as well as the total decay rates for a dipole parallel to the iridium layer at distances between 10 nm and 70 nm from the iridium surface .",
    "note that the rates are normalized with respect to the decay rates of an equivalent dipole in bulk diamond . at these distances",
    "there is a strong influence of the metal as the dipole near - field components efficiently couple to evanescent waves in the metal .",
    "the modification of the decay rates is especially pronounced for distances of less than 20 nm : due to the near - field coupling to the absorbing metal the non - radiative decay rate is enhanced by a factor of eight , while the radiative decay is simultaneously lowered by more than a factor of two . for a distance of 60 nm the decay rates roughly match the rates for the dipole without the presence of the iridium layer .",
    "thus the presence of the metal layer might account for a spread of approximately a factor of eight in the measured lifetimes due to the varying positions of the colour centres in the nano - diamonds .",
    "however , we note that the lifetime reduction does not lead to an enhanced radiative decay due to the quenching by the metal in accordance with previous observations @xcite .",
    "+ the rate coefficients @xmath56 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 governing the population dynamics of the colour centres , are derived from the limiting values of the fitted parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 : @xmath57             \\label{limv2 } k_{23}=k_{31}a^{\\infty}\\\\[0.01 \\textwidth ]             \\label{limv3 } k_{21}=\\frac{1}{\\tau_1 ^ 0}-k_{23 } \\qquad \\textrm{for } \\qquad k_{21}+k_{23}>k_{31}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath58 denotes the limit for high excitation power and @xmath59 denotes the limit for vanishing excitation power .",
    "the values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for emitters ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are displayed in figures [ konstem1 ] and [ konstem3 ] .",
    "the data indicate the limiting values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 despite the fact that some oscillatory behaviour is observed",
    ". this might be due to experimental reasons : above saturation spatial drifts changing the intensity impinging onto the emitter do no longer lead to measurable photon count rate changes , thus making detection of drifts and ensuring of constant excitation intensity very challenging .",
    "nevertheless , a rough estimate of the rate coefficients is possible for emitters ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) : we obtain @xmath60 mhz , @xmath61 mhz , @xmath62 mhz for emitter ( 1 ) and @xmath63 mhz , @xmath64 mhz , @xmath65 mhz for emitter ( 3 ) . with these rate coefficients and the measured saturation power i@xmath47",
    "we obtain the power dependence of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 shown as solid lines in figures [ konstem1 ] and [ konstem3 ] .",
    "the curves qualitatively resemble the observed behaviour with deviations especially for @xmath43 and @xmath41 at low powers .",
    "+ in the following we propose an extension of the simple three level model in figure [ 3levelscheme ] allowing to account for these deviations . for the discussion we exemplarily use the data obtained from emitter ( 3 ) . as an alternative to the limiting values used in equation ( [ limv1 ] ) we now employ the limiting value of @xmath43 for zero excitation : @xmath66by using equation ( [ tau20 ] ) instead of ( [ limv1 ] ) together with equation ( [ limv2 ] ) and ( [ limv3 ] ) , we obtain an alternative set of rate parameters : @xmath67 mhz , @xmath68 mhz , @xmath69 mhz .",
    "thus the value of @xmath37 seems to be inconsistent for high and low excitation power , indicating an intensity dependent de - shelving process . as mentioned",
    "before we exclude a de - shelving process linearly dependent on excitation power @xcite , as this model would lead to @xmath70 which is not consistent with our observations .",
    "we therefore tentatively modify the intensity dependence of the rate @xmath37 to follow a saturation law , including an intensity independent rate @xmath71 : @xmath72 the introduction of a saturating de - shelving process is further motivated by the possible explanation of this process as an excitation from the shelving state to higher lying states , as e.g. found for molecules in @xcite .",
    "this excitation process might intrinsically exhibit a saturation behaviour .",
    "for the new model we calculate @xmath36 , @xmath35 , @xmath71 , @xmath73 under the assumption @xmath74 : @xmath75 for emitter ( 3 ) we obtain with equations ( [ limnew1 ] ) to ( [ limnew4 ] ) and @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 derived from the measurements : @xmath80 mhz , @xmath81 mhz , @xmath82 mhz and @xmath83 mhz",
    ". now the parameter @xmath84 as well as the proportionality constant @xmath85 for the excitation rate @xmath86 , can be determined by fitting the intensity dependent data for @xmath41 with equation ( [ apar ] ) ( @xmath85 is no longer accessible from the saturation measurement in this model ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ konstem3 ] , we obtain @xmath87w and @xmath88 mhz@xmath89w . with these values of @xmath84 and",
    "@xmath85 the intensity dependence of @xmath42 and @xmath43 is also well described .",
    "we thus conclude that a complex power dependence of the de - shelving rate has to be accounted for to properly model the siv - centre dynamics . to prove the general validity of this model , it has to be tested on a larger number of emitters .",
    "+ the rate coefficients determine the maximum obtainable photon count rate i@xmath9 for cw excitation and the maximum steady state population of the excited state @xmath90 : @xmath91 for the simple three level model @xmath92 has to be replaced by the intensity independent rate @xmath37 . as the orientation of the emitting dipole inside the nano - crystal is unknown",
    "the actual collection efficiency @xmath93 includes an uncertainty of a factor of 2.4 as discussed in section [ photoncount ] .",
    "in addition , the rate coefficients have to be considered as a rough estimate , thus determining the quantum efficiency @xmath94 from the measured photon rate is not reliable . nevertheless , by using the rate coefficients we illustrate the influence of the shelving state on the maximum photon count rate for cw excitation : for an off - resonantly pumped two - level - system with decay rate @xmath35 we expect a maximum photon rate @xmath95 thus we deduce that for emitter ( 3 ) the presence of the shelving state changes the maximum photon rate only by about a factor of two as @xmath96 compared to @xmath97 for an off - resonantly pumped two level system . in contrary , for emitter ( 1 ) the presence of the shelving state leads to @xmath98 thus potentially lowering the maximum photon rate by a factor of more than 10 . as the nature of the shelving state and",
    "the relaxation process is unknown , the reason for the differences in bunching behaviour remains unclear .",
    "we emphasize that the large spread in excited state lifetimes in combination with large differences in shelving state dynamics suffice to explain large variations in photon emission rates of siv - centres .",
    "function of emitter ( 5 ) measured at 1.3 @xmath1w .",
    "the fit confirms that the residual g@xmath0(0 ) value is fully explained by the timing jitter of the setup , thus proving existence of a single emitter .",
    "[ em5kryo],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    spectroscopy of colour centres at cryogenic temperatures is an important issue for their application in quantum optics : underlying fine structures of zpls can only be observed at cryogenic temperatures reducing phonon - broadening ; additionally the determination of low temperature line - widths is crucial for applications involving coherent processes .",
    "we characterize emitter ( 5 ) at room temperature and at 30 k. figure [ em5kryo ] displays the measured spectra .",
    "note that g@xmath0 measurements prove single emitter behaviour for both temperatures .",
    "emitter ( 5 ) has a room temperature line - width of 1 nm . upon cooling to 30 k a fine structure evolves consisting of four components at 740.42 nm , 740.11 nm , 739.19 nm and 738.91 nm .",
    "the line - width of the individual components reduces to 0.17 nm .",
    "this four line fine structure is characteristic for siv - centres and has so far been observed only for ensembles of siv - centres in single - crystals of high quality @xcite , thus providing significant evidence for the identification of the observed colour centres as siv - centres .",
    "the spacing of the outer components is 1.5 nm . for siv - centres in single - crystals",
    "this spacing increases from 0.7 nm ( no stress ) to 2.4 nm by applying a stress of 0.5 gpa along 001-direction @xcite . thus the observed spacing can be explained by stress inside the nano - crystal .",
    "the spectrum shifts by 1.5 nm to shorter wavelengths when cooling to 30 k ( highest fine structure peak compared to room temperature zpl ) .",
    "this shift is also characteristic for siv - centres in poly - crystalline cvd - diamonds : ghorokovsky et al .",
    "@xcite as well as feng et al .",
    "@xcite observed a blue shift of 1.4 nm and 1.2 nm , respectively , when cooling to 100 k and no further shift for lower temperatures .",
    "for the observed single siv - centre the line shifting also stops around 110 k , thus resembling the observations for ensembles .",
    "we have identified an advanced material system for single photon sources in diamond employing high quality cvd - nano - diamonds on iridium produced via spin coating seeding and microwave cvd - growth . due to impurities in the growth process",
    "single siv - centres are formed .",
    "the iridium substrates together with the small volume nano - diamonds provide the major advantage of single photon emission with negligible contributions of background fluorescence .",
    "the siv colour centres observed here are much better than their reputation and exhibit very promising behaviour as single photon sources : line - widths as low as 0.7 nm could be detected with a fraction of up to 88% of photons emitted into the zpl .",
    "in addition , the observed colour centres feature count rates up to 4.8 mcps thus being the brightest diamond based single photon sources to date . by performing spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures",
    "we verify the identification of these colour centres as siv - centres , measuring for the first time the fine structure splitting of a single siv - centre .",
