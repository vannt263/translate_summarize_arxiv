    "strong correlation of photons at the few quanta level can make possible a variety of nonlinear optical devices useful for quantum information processing , such as single - photon transistors or switching devices @xcite and the generation of single photons on demand @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the photon - photon correlation mediated by the emitters can also be employed to simulate quantum many - body systems in a controllable way .",
    "for example , the effective on - site repulsion between photons can be exploited to study quantum phase transitions such as the mott - superfluid transition @xcite and the fermionization of bosons @xcite .",
    "these applications are closely related to a specific correlation effect , namely a single - photon blockade effect @xcite once a system is excited by one photon , the abosorption of next photons is blocked , e.g. , due to the anharmonic energy level structure of the system .",
    "recently , interest in the correlation effect has also been extended to multi - photon level in the context of multi - photon gateway , where a random ( poissonian ) stream of photons can be converted into a bunch of temporally correlated @xmath2 photons .",
    "in particular , kubanek _ et al . _ demonstrated the operation of two - photon gateway to some extent using an optical cavity qed system @xcite . in view of all these efforts",
    ", it seems very crucial to have a theoretical framework that can appropriately characterize multi - photon correlations @xcite , e.g. , @xmath2-photon blockade effect , and desirably that can be efficiently tested in experiment .",
    "conventionally , correlation of photons is measured by the @xmath2th - order coherence functions introduced by glauber @xcite , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of an optical field .",
    "however , it is noted in the recent experiments of cavity qed @xcite that @xmath6 is not effective to resolve the correlated two photon emission due to a huge bunching at the atom - cavity bare resonance overshadowing the two - photon resonance .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath2 goes beyond two , @xmath7 or its simple variants @xcite contain more peaks at @xmath8 photon resonances , irrelevant to genuine @xmath2-photon correlation , as to be shown below .",
    "instead one may take @xmath2-photon excitation peaks in @xmath9 spectrum itself , e.g. in @xcite , as a confirming evidence of @xmath2-photon correlations . rigorously speaking ,",
    "however , the multi - photon resonant excitation peaks spectroscopically identified only uncover the energy - level structure of the system . whether each peak in the bare coincidence @xmath9 indicates",
    "relevant photon correlation must be checked very carefully .",
    "for example , the three - photon coincidence tends to increase in the spectrum without any correlation if the system possesses two - photon correlation since an uncorrelated emission added to a correlated pair may register another three - photon coincidence . therefore , we need to consider a stricter physical context for characterizing correlated emission of @xmath2-photons .",
    "although there have been several studies on higher - order photon statistics in view of nonclassicality @xcite , none of them carries a clear interpretation as multiphoton correlation .",
    "here we propose a conceptually rigorous , but easy - to - implement , criterion for measuring correlated multi - photon emissions out of a quantum optical system .",
    "the criterion is derived by considering wavefunction collapse related to sequential photo - detections @xcite and has the following merits .",
    "( i ) it only detects highly - correlated @xmath2-photon emissions with no classical analogue , and ( ii ) can be tested by usual photon coincidence detections ( no conditional measurement ) in a detector - efficiency insensitive form , and therefore , experimentally favorable .",
    "we also introduce a quantitative measure of @xmath2-photon correlation based on this criterion , which is quite robust in addressing multi - photon correlations against experimental imperfections .",
    "this is a practical merit of our approach made possible by the well - established correlation context .",
    "we illustrate the power of our method in an optical cavity qed system , where genuine @xmath2-photon correlated emissions can be efficiently verified in accordance with its anharmonic energy levels .",
    "in order to envision a generic , though not exhaustive , scenario where multiphoton correlations may arise , let us compare two systems , one with harmonic and the other with anharmonic level structure [ fig.1 ( a ) ] .",
    "when a harmonic system with level spacing @xmath10 is excited by an external driving on resonance ( @xmath11 ) , all energy levels are equally accessible . on the other hand , for an anharmonic system ,",
    "if the external field is @xmath2-photon resonant with the @xmath2th level , other levels than @xmath2th would not be substantially addressed by the external field . as a result",
    ", the system could be excited to contain only @xmath2 correlated quanta and further excitation would be prohibited@xmath2-quanta ( photon ) blockade effect .",
    "we will apply a similar line of reasoning to emission , rather than excitation , process . specifically",
    ", we construct a criterion to detect ` pure ' @xmath2-photon correlated emission by incorporating two distinct features , ( i ) surge or rapid emission of photons up to @xmath2 quanta and ( ii ) blockade beyond @xmath2 , which can be applied to any quantum optical systems , not necessarily anharmonic ones .      generally , the photo - detection rate @xmath12 is proportional to the intensity of the optical field under consideration , @xmath13 , where the operators @xmath14 correspond to the positive- and the negative - frequency part of the field .",
    "let us assume that a quantum system can be described by a pure steady state @xmath15 for simplicity , but our argument applies equally well to mixed states .",
    "if it has emitted @xmath16 quanta , the wavefunction is collapsed to @xmath17 conditioned on these emissions .",
    "the detection rate for the succeeding @xmath2th photon is then given by @xmath18 after the normalization of the conditional state @xmath19 .",
    "specifically , if the emission out of the system is a bunch of highly correlated @xmath2-photons , the second photon will be emitted right after the first photon and the third photon after the second , and so on .",
    "this idea can be used to construct our criterion as follows .",
    "the  bare \" rate for the first emission is simply given by the intensity , @xmath20 , which only characterizes the signal strength and has little to do with correlation .",
    "for @xmath2-photon correlation ( @xmath21 ) , once a photon is emitted , however , the next emission will immediately follow , thus the conditional rate @xmath22 must be large enough .",
    "in particular , we require @xmath22 to be larger than @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 , which is nothing but the bunching condition in the glauber @xmath25 function .",
    "extending the requirement to next emissions sequentially , we derive a set of _ surge _ conditions @xmath26 which must be satisfied for each @xmath27 .      however , the satisfaction of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ratio ] ) for all @xmath27 is not sufficient to ensure @xmath2-photon correlation , and importantly , one must also look at the next occurrences carefully .",
    "after the detection of @xmath2 photons , the succeeding emissions must be suppressed , which can be expressed as @xmath28 the fulfillment of all the surge and the blockade conditions in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : ratio ] ) and ( [ eqn : ratio1 ] ) respectively constitutes our criterion for @xmath2-photon correlated emission .",
    "note that the condition ( [ eqn : ratio1 ] ) coincides with the special case of the higher - order antibunching criteria introduced in @xcite for the nonclassicality of photon statistics , rather than the correlation effect .    in our criterion ,",
    "it is crucial to use the _ conditional _ rates @xmath29 , rather than the _ bare _ rates @xmath30 , as the former takes into account the correlation between adjacent emissions in a stronger sense .",
    "however , the resulting criterion does not require any conditional measurements .",
    "instead , the quantities @xmath31 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : ratio ] ) and ( [ eqn : ratio1 ] ) simply involve various photon - coincidence rates and we particularly note that the numerator and the denominator are in the same order of the field strength .",
    "it is thus given in an experimentally desirable form , that is , insensitive to the quantum efficiency of photodetectors .",
    "the conditions in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : ratio ] ) and ( [ eqn : ratio1 ] ) may be used to define a quantitative measure @xmath32 of @xmath2-photon correlation as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a truncated excitation number to be taken appropriate to a given situation .",
    "@xmath32 quantifies the strength of the @xmath2-photon correlation by measuring the deviation of @xmath31 from unity in the surge and the blockade conditions of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : ratio ] ) and ( [ eqn : ratio1 ] ) , respectively , and returns a nonzero value only when all those conditions are satisfied . to experimentally obtain @xmath32 for a given system , one first measures the bare @xmath35-photon coincidence rates @xmath36 for all @xmath37 .",
    "then , each conditional rate @xmath38 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ratio ] ) is evaluated and plugged in to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : measure ] ) to determine the value of @xmath32 .",
    "\\(a ) conventionally , multi - photon correlations have been discussed in terms of the glauber coherence functions @xmath39",
    "( @xmath40 : a general space - time point ) @xcite .",
    "the context of correlation in @xmath41 is , however , rather limited and we particularly note that @xmath41 compares the @xmath2-photon coincidence rate ( numerator ) only with the single - photon counting rates ( denominator ) .",
    "large ( small ) value of @xmath41 characterizes a bunching ( antibunching ) effect with no strict @xmath2-photon correlation that can emerge even in a classical scattering system , e.g. @xmath42 for a thermal light ( hanbury - brown  twiss effect @xcite ) .",
    "another example of @xmath43 with no rigorous two - photon correlation will be shown below in sec.[sect : cqed ] .",
    "\\(b ) it is , therefore , interesting to ask whether our criteria of @xmath2-photon correlation can be fulfilled by a classical source .",
    "it turns out that , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ subsect2 - 2 ] , the blockade condition in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ratio1 ] ) is related to the nonclassicality of light fields @xcite .",
    "let us consider the single - mode case in which the field amplitude @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) may be replaced by the annihilation ( creation ) operator @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "then , as a special case of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can show that , for a classical source represented by a positive - definite glauber-@xmath46 function , @xmath47 , a cauchy - schwarz inequality follows as @xmath48 the violation of the above inequality , which is nothing but the blockade condition @xmath49 in eq.([eqn : ratio1 ] ) , is thus a clear signature of nonclassicality .",
    "so our criteria of multiphoton correlation can be fulfiled only by nonclassical sources .",
    "we emphasize that , in the so called multiphoton antibunching criteria in @xcite , the focus was made on how to reveal nonclassicality of the field by a mathematical approach based on the positive glauber-@xmath46 function , thus lacking a clear interpretation as multiphoton correlation .",
    "to illustrate our criterion , we consider a cavity qed system  one of the well known anharmonic systems that can be implemented in various experimental platforms @xcite .",
    "a qubit ( two - state atom , quantum dot , etc . )",
    "is coupled to a single mode field driven by a classical field . for simplicity",
    "we investigate the on - resonance case , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the qubit transition frequency and @xmath52 the cavity resonance frequency .",
    "the qubit - cavity system at coupling strength @xmath53 is then described by the hamiltonian @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the pauli pseudospin operators .",
    "the composite system has the ground state @xmath57 with the energy @xmath58 and the polaritonic excited states @xmath59 with @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) [ see fig.1 ( b ) ] .",
    "therefore , when the system is driven by an external field at frequency @xmath62 , @xmath2-photon resonant absorption may occur @xcite at @xmath63    in practical situations , the qubit and the cavity field may interact with markovian environments , which causes dissipation and decoherence to the system .",
    "the global evolution is then governed by the master equation @xmath64+\\gamma ( \\sigma_-\\rho \\sigma_+-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_+\\sigma_-\\rho-\\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\sigma_+\\sigma_-)+\\kappa ( 2a\\rho a^{\\dag}-a^\\dag a\\rho-\\rho a^\\dag a)$ ] , where @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) is the qubit ( cavity ) decay rate and the interaction hamiltonian @xmath67 with the driving strength @xmath68 and the detuning @xmath69 .     as a function of @xmath70 for @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",

    "we see that more resonant peaks are spectroscopically observed at @xmath73 as the order @xmath2 is increased in a very strong - coupling regime , @xmath81 .",
    "it is important to note that not all the peaks in @xmath2th order coincidence rate are relevant to @xmath2-photon correlation ( e.g. , the peak at @xmath82 in the two - photon coincidence ) , so the bare coincidence rates may not be used as such to address genuine multiphoton correlation . to overcome this difficulty , for instance",
    ", one may try to classify those peaks with a prior knowledge on the excitation paths @xcite .",
    "however , in realistic situations , the peaks become less resolved as the coupling strength is reduced ( not shown ) . more importantly , these resonant peaks give information only on the level structure of excitation and have a weak connection to correlated emissions .      instead ,",
    "if one measures the glauber coherence function @xmath41 of the output , the result may characterize the correlation of emitted photons to some extent , but not in a full rigorous sense . in particular , @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows a large bunching at zero detuning @xmath84 , which has nothing to do with genuine @xmath2-photon correlation as we will clearly show below .",
    "close inspection of photon statistics reveals that the system does exhibit some nonclassical behavior at @xmath84 , e.g. the oscillation of conditional detection rate @xmath29 which peaks at even number of @xmath35 , but it is not a rigorous @xmath2-photon correlation at any level @xmath2 in view of our criterion .",

    "the  spurious \" peak at @xmath84 disappears by our criterion , which rigorously confirms that this seeming  resonance \" indeed does not represent pure @xmath2-photon correlated emission .",
