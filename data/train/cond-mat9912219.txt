    "the two - dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet ( 2d - tla ) was firstly proposed to be a candidate for the disordered ( or spin - liquid ) ground - state of the spin-@xmath9 heisenberg model ( anderson _ et al . _ in 70 s  @xcite ) .",
    "different approaches failed to support this conjecture , but favor a ground - state with nel long range order ( lro )  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the lattice frustration on the 2d - tla attracts great interest of theorists , providing a challenge for exotic antiferromagnets .",
    "recently , the multiple - spin exchange model has been extensively studied as an alternative to the heisenberg model , showing a rich structure of ground - states  @xcite . in this model",
    ", the ground - state can be ferromagnetic ( fm ) , anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) with nel lro , or a spin - liquid ( sl ) .",
    "a prospective phase diagram has been given by misguich _",
    "et al . _ , who considered two- , four- , and five - spin exchange interactions on the 2d - tla  @xcite .",
    "they found that a large enough four - spin exchange interaction drives th fm phase into a sl phase .",
    "they did not study how the afm nel lro is destroyed by the four - spin exchange interaction , and how the transition between nel lro and the short range rvb phase takes place .",
    "this question is the main object of this paper .",
    "unhappily there is no exact method allowing the study of the zero temperature phases of such frustrated systems . for a finite system , however , one can always , in principle , represent the eigenstates in the complete basis of spin configurations .",
    "this allows one to have a real touch on the exact ground - states of small size systems through numerical computations .",
    "the huge number of spin configurations ( @xmath10 ) becomes a great obstacle on the way of numerical simulations . on the most recent computers , the largest sample that may be handled in exact diagonalizations",
    "has @xmath11 sites . on the triangular lattice ,",
    "the quantum monte carlo method is plagued by the well - known sign problem , but a new technique called stochastic reconfiguration allows handling samples up to @xmath12 sites  @xcite .",
    "all these calculations point to nel lro , with a sublattice magnetization of the order of @xmath13 of the saturated value  @xcite .",
    "series expansions give a reduced ( @xmath14 ) but non - zero sublattice magnetization  @xcite .    on the other hand , in the case of short range correlations ,",
    "the situation is more straightforward , as soon as the available sizes are of the order of , or larger than the correlation length .",
    "this is fortunately the case in the sl phase found in the @xmath15 model ( @xmath16 ) by misguich _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we use exact diagonalizations to obtain the exact eigenenergies versus wave vectors and total spin for 12 , 16 , 19 , 21 , 24 and 27 site samples of the @xmath15 model ( @xmath17 ) on the 2d - tla . in the classical limit",
    ", the afm ground - state of the 2d - tla can be described as a three - sublattice structure , with spins of different sublattices making angles of @xmath18 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are compatible with the three - sublattice structure for samples with 12 , 21 , 24 and 27 sites , but not for the 16 and 19 site samples",
    ". therefore , we use twisted boundary conditions for the 16 and 19 site samples  @xcite and periodic boundary conditions for the 12 , 21 , 24 and 27 site ones .",
    "the hamiltonian of the multiple - spin exchange model is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the @xmath21-spin exchange tunneling probabilities ( exchange coefficients ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the @xmath21-spin exchange operators and their inverse operators , respectively .",
    "the alternative sign in the summation over @xmath21 in eq .",
    "[ hamilt ] comes from the permutation of fermions . in general , the exchange coefficients decrease with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "the two - spin exchange term gives exactly the heisenberg hamiltonian up to a constant , since one has @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are spins localized at site @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the three - spin exchange operator is exactly equivalent to a sum of two - spin exchange operators  @xcite .",
    "thus , the three - spin exchange term of equation ( [ hamilt ] ) can be absorbed into the two - spin exchange term , as long as @xmath0 is replaced by the effective two - spin exchange coefficient @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , except for the two - spin exchange , the next most important term is the four - spin exchange .",
    "a pure positive two - spin exchange ( i.e. , the heisenberg hamiltonian ) on the 2d - tla gives an afm phase with nel lro , and , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a pure four - spin exchange gives a sl phase . in this paper",
    "we use the specific properties of the spectra of these different kinds of phases to study the transition from one phase to the other , when the relative weight of the four - spin exchange @xmath1 increases relatively to the antiferromagnetic two - spin coupling . in the following ,",
    "all the energies are measured in units of @xmath30 .",
    "little is known on this region of the phase diagram .",
    "previous works are based on a classical approximation  @xcite , semi - classical spin - wave calculations  @xcite or mean - field schwinger - boson results  @xcite .",
    "the classical result predicts a transition from the 3-sublattice nel state to a 4-sublattice tetrahedral state at @xmath31 .",
    "both quantum approaches indicate that the four - spin exchange strongly enhance fluctuations in the 3-sublattice nel phase .",
    "kubo  _ et .",
    "@xcite found that the sublattice magnetization vanishes for @xmath32 . in the schwinger - boson approach  @xcite ,",
    "the nel state is destroyed when @xmath33 .",
    "these two techniques have a general tendency to underestimate the effects of quantum fluctuations on ordered phases . the exact diagonalization analysis presented here indeed",
    "shows that the nel long - ranged order disappears for a smaller value of @xmath1 ( the critical value is estimated to be in the interval @xmath34 ) .",
    "in the classical limit , a @xmath35-site 2d - tla sample with nel lro is characterized by a three - sublattice structure with spin @xmath36 on each sublattice .",
    "coupling of these three @xmath36-spins , gives total spin @xmath37 with @xmath38 degeneracy  @xcite . in an isotropic antiferromagnet (",
    "as the collinear afm which has equal spin susceptibilities and spin wave velocities ) the finite - size total energy depends on the total spin @xmath37 ( to first order in @xmath39 ) as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the energy of the ground - state in the thermodynamic limit and @xmath42 is the isotropic magnetic susceptibility of the sample . in the anisotropic case",
    "this equation should be rewritten : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the component of the total spin @xmath37 on the internal symmetry axis of the spin system , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the magnetic susceptibilities on the internal symmetry axis and on the perpendicular plane , respectively . in the broken symmetry picture",
    "the symmetry axis is perpendicular to the plane of the spins and @xmath45 ( respectively @xmath46 ) measures the spin fluctuations orthogonal to ( respectively in ) the spin plane .",
    "eq .  [ rotator ] ( respectively eq .  [ rotator2 ] ) , is the dynamical equation of a rigid rotator ( respectively of a quantum top ) .",
    "( [ rotator ] , [ rotator2 ] ) show that the slopes of the total energy versus @xmath47 and @xmath48 approach zero as @xmath39 does when @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath44 is an internal quantum number dynamically generated , which is not under control in a finite - size study .",
    "but the total spin @xmath37 is a good quantum number and the @xmath50 scaling of the @xmath47 dependence of the total energy versus sample size is interesting because it is more rapid than the scaling law of the order parameter ( which goes as @xmath51 )  @xcite .      in a sl phase , contrarily to the nel lro phase ,",
    "the spin gap ( i.e. the difference in total energy between ground - states in the @xmath52 sector and in the @xmath53 sector ) does not collapse to zero in the thermodynamic limit . the finite - size scaling law in this second situation is not known exactly , insofar as the `` massive '' phase is not characterized precisely .",
    "heuristically , we expect the finite - size spin gap to decrease exponentially to a finite value @xmath54 with the characteristic length @xmath55 of the spin - spin correlations . for samples of linear size",
    "@xmath56 smaller than the correlation length and in the cross - over regime , there are not enough quantum fluctuations to destroy the sublattice magnetization and the system probably behaves as it were classical ( i.e. with a spin gap decreasing as @xmath57 ) .",
    "the following heuristic law might be used to interpolate between the two behaviors : @xmath58      the use of this heuristic law ( eq .  [ gap ] ) encounters a severe difficulty as soon as the disordered system approaches a quantum critical point : in such a situation the correlation length @xmath55 diverges , the gap closes to zero and on a finite - size sample it is impossible to discriminate between such a situation and isotropic nel lro ( eq .  [ rotator ] ) .      in view of this difficulty",
    "we have done a pedestrian finite - size scaling of the spin gap by using the simplest linear @xmath39 behavior which probably gives a lower bound of the gap in a sl outside critical points .",
    "the physical reason is that we expect the finite - size corrections of the gap value to be smaller in a system with a finite correlation length ( no long - range order ) than in a lro nel phase where it vanishes as @xmath39 .  .",
    "the analysis of section  [ sec : sym ] shows that the behavior of the system changes rather abruptly from a nel like spectrum to a spectrum with a very large number of low lying singlets below the first @xmath52 state ( and potentially a @xmath59 residual entropy in the singlet sector ) .",
    "this happens before any decrease to zero of the spin velocity or of the homogeneous spin susceptibility .",
    "so , if the true thermodynamical system has indeed a critical point between the two phases , the sizes we are looking at are too small to scrutinize the critical regime . ] the results extrapolated to @xmath60 are shown in fig .",
    "[ spingap ] . strictly speaking the spin gap",
    "never extrapolates to zero except for a pure @xmath0 where it is equal to zero within its error bar ( at @xmath61 , data of bernu  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for @xmath62 are added to the present results , see fig .",
    "[ spingap ] . ) .",
    "nevertheless these data already show three distinct ranges for the parameter @xmath1 : for very small @xmath1 ( below 0.075 ) nel lro is plausible but should be confirmed by another approach . for @xmath1 larger than @xmath63",
    "a gap certainly opens rapidly with increasing @xmath1 and then decrease for @xmath64 .",
    "the spin gap criterion can not give more insight on the phase diagram .",
    "we will now move to the analysis of the symmetries of the low lying levels of the spectra to characterize more precisely these three phases .",
    "firstly we show the low energy spectrum of the pure heisenberg model on the 21 site sample ( fig .",
    "[ spect21 ] ) . in order to emphasize the low energy structure we have displayed the low energy spectrum minus a rigid rotator energy @xmath65 .",
    "let us first concentrate on the lowest part of the energy spectrum in each s sector ( solid and open triangular symbols in the figure ) .",
    "this family of levels forms on a finite - size lattice the quantum counterpart of the semi - classical nel state .",
    "these specific states are in the trivial representation of the invariance group of the three - sublattice nel ordered solution  @xcite . to be definite :    * the nel ground - state breaks the 1-step translation but is invariant in a 3-step translation : as a consequence the only wave vectors appearing in this family of qdjs ( for quasi - degenerate - joint - states defined by bernu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) are respectively the center @xmath66 and corners @xmath67 of the brillouin zone . *",
    "these qdjs belong specifically to the trivial representation of @xmath68 as the nel state itself ( i.e. they are invariant in a @xmath69 rotation , and in a reflection symmetry ) . * as the @xmath70 rotation symmetry of the lattice is broken in this particular ground - state , these qdjs appear either in the odd or even representation of the 2-fold rotation group ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) . * the numbers and characteristics ( quantum numbers ) of the qdjs in each @xmath37 sector",
    "are precisely fixed by theory  @xcite : for the 21 sites spectrum displayed in fig .",
    "[ spect21 ] ( as for all sizes that have been studied up to now ) the numbers of low lying levels and their quantum numbers correspond exactly to the above - mentioned theoretical predictions .      the dynamical law given by eq .",
    "[ rotator2 ] is still imperfectly obeyed for the 21 site sample : in particular the generation of the internal symmetry is still imperfect but nevertheless the spectrum of a quantum top could already be anticipated .    above these levels with specific properties ,",
    "there appear eigenstates with wave vectors belonging to the inside of the brillouin zone ( simple dashes in fig .  [ spect21 ] ) .",
    "a group of such eigenstates with different total spin represents a magnon excitation of the nel ground - state . as the antiferromagnetic magnons have a linear dispersion law , the softest magnon energy scales as the smallest wave vector accommodated in the brillouin zone of the finite - size sample .",
    "thus , for sizes large enough , these levels collapse to the ground - state as @xmath71 , more slowly than the qdjs which collapse as @xmath39 to the thermodynamic nel ground - state energy .",
    "that is the reason of the appearance in fig .",
    "[ spect21 ] of a quasi gap between the qdjs and the magnon excitations .",
    "this hierarchy of low lying levels is a very strong constraint on the finite - size samples spectra .",
    "it is perfect for sizes up to 27 and for @xmath1 smaller or equal to 0.075 and totally absent   spectra at @xmath61 and @xmath72 are displayed in fig .  2 and fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite . ] for @xmath1 larger or equal to 0.1 .",
    "* this result , associated to the spin gap behavior , consistently proves that for @xmath1 larger or equal to 0.1 the system is in a spin - liquid state with rather short range spin - spin correlations . * for @xmath73 the structure of the low lying eigen - levels of the spectra are compatible with nel lro . but as discussed above , it is indeed impossible to precisely point a quantum critical transition within this approach . in view of the spectra",
    ", we might speculate that the transition is second order and that it takes place between 0.07 and 0.1 .",
    "* from @xmath61 to @xmath74 we see a softening of the spin - wave velocity consistent with the gradual decrease of the nel lro ( fig .",
    "[ spinwave ] ) . however , fig .",
    "[ singlets ] shows that a large number of singlet states are already present at low energy when @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the system is certainly no longer in the ordered phase at @xmath74 .",
    "we can conclude from fig .",
    "[ spinwave ] that the spin wave velocity does not vanish at the critical point ( even if the precise location of the transition can not be determined ) .",
    "this has been previously suggested by various analytical approaches  @xcite .",
    "the sizes studied are nevertheless too small to check azaria s prediction  @xcite of an @xmath75 symmetry of the effective field theory at the critical point .",
    "contrarily to our expectations , the sl phase which appears immediately after the disappearance of the nel ordered phase is not the phase studied by misguich  _ et al . _",
    "it is indeed a sl phase , with a gap and short range spin - spin correlations .",
    "but , as might be seen in fig",
    ".  [ singlets ] , this phase exhibits a very large number of singlets in the magnetic gap and seems in this respect similar to the spin - liquid phase of the heisenberg model on the kagom lattice  @xcite .",
    "however , we are not aware of any exponential degeneracy ( _ i.e. _ @xmath76 ) in the classical mse model  ) . moreover ,",
    "this classical degeneracy was only found in a region where @xmath77 is _ ferromagnetic _",
    "( @xmath78 ) . ] , as is the case for the classical kagom antiferromagnet .",
    "we suspect that a much larger four - spin exchange parameter will be needed to recover the sl phase studied by misguich _",
    "et al._. these data point to the existence of this new phase in a finite range of parameters @xmath79 .",
    "however , one can not disregard the hypothesis that these properties are in fact those of a critical point , with a critical region enlarged by finite - size effects .",
    "more work with different methods is needed to clarify this point .",
    "in an external magnetic field @xmath80 along the @xmath81 axis , the total energy of the state with component @xmath82 of the total spin is given by : @xmath83 the magnetization is determined by the minimum of @xmath84 respective to @xmath82 , which requires @xmath85 . therefore , in the isotropic case with nel lro , one has @xmath86 where @xmath87 , is the polarization relative to the saturated magnetization @xmath88 and @xmath42 is indeed the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "we noticed that when the four - spin exchange interaction increases , deviation from eq .",
    "[ rotator ] occurs about @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "this is in agreement with the earlier mean - field calculation of kubo and momoi  @xcite who predicted magnetization plateaus at @xmath91 and @xmath92 in the @xmath15 model .",
    "we present the magnetization curve of the 24-site sample in fig .",
    "[ plateau ] . a small plateau exists at @xmath93 magnetization for @xmath61 , and its width first increases slowly as @xmath1 increases and then decreases from around @xmath94 . this @xmath93 plateau has also been found in previous studies ( see  @xcite and references therein ) in the pure three - sublattice nel ordered system .",
    "the @xmath92 magnetization appears at about @xmath72 and its width increases with @xmath1 .",
    "finally , there still exists a plateau at about @xmath92 in samples with odd numbers of sites , but it distributes over the two closest positions to the @xmath95 magnetization .",
    "the @xmath91 and @xmath92 plateaus correspond to the classical @xmath7 and @xmath8 ordering of spins ( see momoi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the four - sublattice @xmath8 state ) .",
    "these phases are more `` classical '' than the zero - field phase , but yet show a decrease of the sublattice magnetization from the classical saturation values .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the transition between the nel ordered state and a spin liquid state of the multiple - spin exchange model by means of the exact diagonalization method .",
    "the pure three - sublattice nel ordered phase is gradually destroyed by quantum fluctuations when increasing the 4-spin exchange coupling .",
    "the spin wave velocity decreases but apparently remains finite at the transition . the quantum disordered phase tuned by the 4-spin exchange coupling is different from the pure @xmath1 phase studied by misguich  _ et",
    "al._. it exhibits low energy singlet excitations , reminding of kagom sl .",
    "this result opens many interesting questions that can not be answered in the present framework : is this phase a new generic sl phase or a finite - size manifestation of a quantum critical regime  ?",
    "are these singlet excitations the `` resonon '' modes invoked by rokhsar and kivelson  @xcite  ? in agreement with previous studies  @xcite , we find two magnetization plateaus at @xmath93 and @xmath95 of the full magnetization .",
    "these plateaus are associated to the semi - classical @xmath7 and @xmath8 ordering structures . a finite - size scaling on much larger sizes is needed to draw a definite conclusion on this magnetic phase diagram .",
