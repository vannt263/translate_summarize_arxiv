    "the outer crust of a compact star is formed of metal consisting almost exclusively of iron and other heavy elements . for a typical white dwarf",
    "the solid @xmath0 core is surrounded by @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ions and a gas of free electrons , whereas in neutron stars ( pulsars ) , central densities are extremely high ( up to @xmath5 ) therefore the equation of state is relatively fixed .",
    "the outermost region of a neutron star is formed of a solid @xmath0 ( density @xmath6 ) crust forming a crystalline lattice , surrounded by degenerate electrons .",
    "the star is thus regarded as enveloped in a highly ionized degenerate solid state plasma consisting of densely packed ions and relatively free electrons@xcite .",
    "collectively a plasma behaves as an oscillating system having a characteristic ( resonant ) frequency called the plasma frequency which for a degenerate solid state plasma is well defined throughout the medium . in particular the refractive index of a plasma medium is determined by the plasma frequency , which in turn determines the transmission and reflection of radiation for the plasma @xcite . on the other hand gravitational effects play a key role in all processes occurring in a compact star , so that general relativistic effects are important for an adequate description of the phenomenon . usually these effects are not directly observable but are manifest in an indirect way ; for example via interaction with the magnetic field@xcite , in the accretion of matter@xcite , and other material and radiative processes occurring in vicinity of the star@xcite . since in these situations gravitational field of the star",
    "is comparatively weak ( as compared to totally collapsed objects ) , and magnitude of the angular velocity of the star lies well below the relativistic limit , the equations of the general theory of relativity can be expressed in an approximate form , adequate for a description of the gravitational field of the star .",
    "this approximation due to its formal analogy with classical electromagnetic theory is called the gravitoelectromagnetic ( gem ) approximation .",
    "the linearized geodesic equation contains a velocity dependent gravitomagnetic ( gm ) force whose origin lies in general relativistic frame dragging effects .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that due to the gravitomagnetic force a coupling between the frequency of a material oscillator , consisting of a point mass , and the angular frequency of a gravitational source establishes .",
    "the coupling is especially enhanced at the resonant frequency of the oscillator .",
    "it is therefore of theoretical as well as observational interest to study the possible effects of gravitomagnetic force on collective oscillations of a solid state plasma in compact star crustal regions where gravitational force is particularly effective .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we explain the gem approximation to the general theory of relativity and develop a force law , analogous to classical electromagnetic theory , based on the geodesic equation .",
    "we then extend the formalism for a point mass oscillator , to include the collective behavior of  the plasma in a gem force field , using the kinetic theory for the plasma oscillations in section 3 .",
    "the extension based on the random phase assumption leads to an analogous shift in the plasma frequency .",
    "later in section 4 we investigate the effect of the frequency shift on refractive index of the plasma as a single radially oscillating fluid . in section 5",
    "we summarize the main results and discuss the possibility of detection of the predicted shift . throughout",
    "we employ the gravitational units where @xmath7 unless mentioned otherwise .",
    "in general relativity the gravitational field of a massive object is described by the metric tensor @xmath8 . for sufficiently weak gravitating systems , such as the compact stars ,",
    "a linearization the metric can be adequately assumed , where    @xmath9    and where @xmath10 @xmath11 is the minkowski metric tensor and @xmath12 is the perturbation to the metric such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 are the position coordinates of test particle , with time @xmath16 being the affine parameter . further requiring motion to be slow and @xmath17 denoting the christoffel symbol , the geodesic equation    @xmath18    has the following analogue in the gem approximation@xcite    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and    @xmath21    @xmath22 being mass density and @xmath23 is the volume .",
    "remarkably the formal analogy of the above results with the classical electromagnetism extends to the a gravitational field equations .    since in the slow rotation approximation",
    "the deformations in mass distribution in the star due to rotation are negligible , the star can be regarded as a slowly rotating sphere of homogeneous mass density @xmath24 .",
    "then the gravitoelectric ( ge ) force acting on a unit mass in vicinity of the star is given by the newtonian gravitational force @xmath25 and @xmath26 is given by    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the radius and @xmath29 is the angular velocity of the gravitational source .",
    "the second part of equation ( 3 ) has a non - newtonian origin and is regarded to exhibit typically general relativistic effects , such as the lense - thirring dragging of frames . within the gem approximation",
    "the effect can be interpreted as ` gravitomagnetic current ' induced in the vicinity of the gravitational source due to its rotation .",
    "it therefore plays an important role in testing einstein s theory of gravitation in the weak field and slow rotation approximation .",
    "further it has been demonstrated@xcite that the form of the gm potential does not depend on the choice of a particular frame or coordinate system used , thus making it physically significant for all material as well as radiative processes .",
    "however to measure the effects of this force on a given physical system high accuracy in experiments is required@xcite .",
    "a detailed kinetic theory of plasma oscillations in metals has been developed using the fermi - dirac statistics leading to the quantized theory of elementary excitations@xcite .",
    "however the main features of collective plasma oscillations due to the effects of the gravitomagnetic field can be discussed within  the classical treatment .",
    "we consider the phenomenon of radial electron oscillations confined to two dimensions , whereas the angular velocity vector of the star @xmath29 is inclined at an angle @xmath30 to the plane of oscillations .",
    "the components of acceleration due to gravitoelectric force @xmath31 to be of constant magnitude @xmath32 and the gravitomagnetic force on the @xmath33th electron has the magnitude @xmath34 .",
    "the equations of motion for the radial oscillations of the @xmath33th electron can thus be written as    @xmath35-g+\\dot{r}_{i}hsin\\chi .\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is the electronic charge and @xmath37 the electron mass .",
    "the prime over @xmath38 denotes a sum where @xmath39 is excluded .",
    "since acceleration due to gravitoelectric force is of a constant magnitude , its effect on the electron oscillations with respect to the fixed background of ions will be negligible .",
    "we therefore redefine @xmath40 as @xmath41 in the equation of motion ( 8) . for all practical purposes electrons can be considered as point particles , therefore in an arbitrary region of unit volume the particle density is given by@xcite    @xmath42    we decompose the particle density function into fourier components as    @xmath43dr=\\sum_{i}exp[-ikr_{i}],\\ ] ]    such that    @xmath44\\ ] ]    here it is understood that @xmath33 as a multiplier is the complex number denoting @xmath45 and not the script employed for the summation .",
    "differentiating @xmath46 with respect to time we obtain    @xmath47,\\ ] ]    and    @xmath48exp[-ikr_{i}].\\ ] ]    a substitution from ( 8) into ( 13 ) gives    @xmath49+% \\dot{r}_{i}hsin\\chi ) \\}exp[-ikr_{i}]\\ ] ]    which can be simplified to give    @xmath50-\\frac{% 4\\pi e^{2}}{m}\\sum_{ijk^{\\prime } } ( \\frac{k}{k^{\\prime } } ) \\{exp[i(k^{\\prime } -k)r_{i}]\\}exp[-ik^{\\prime } r_{j } ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -i\\sum_{i}k\\dot{r}_{i}hsin\\chi exp[-ikr_{i}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the second term on the right hand side can be split into two parts one for @xmath51 and the other for @xmath52 :    @xmath53+\\frac{4\\pi e^{2}}{m}\\sum_{k\\neq k^{\\prime } } \\frac{k}{k^{\\prime } } \\sum_{i}exp[-ik^{\\prime } r_{i}]\\sum_{j}exp[i(k^{\\prime } -k)r_{j}].\\ ] ]    the phase factors , randomly distributed in the complex plane , approximately cancel each other out .",
    "therefore the sum of such factors is small , and hence the second term being a product of such summations is negligible .",
    "thus random phase approximation gives in equation ( 15 )    @xmath50-\\frac{% 4\\pi ne^{2}}{m}\\sum_{i}exp[-ikr_{i } ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -i\\sum_{i}k\\dot{r}_{i}exp[-ikr_{i}]hsin\\chi .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    further since in a metal electrons are strongly bound to the ions , their random thermal motion is negligible , therefore the contributions coming from the first term containing @xmath54 are also negligible . using equations ( 10 ) and ( 12 ) in the second and third term of equation ( 17 )",
    "we obtain    @xmath55",
    "to determine the resonant frequency for the fourier component for electron density function @xmath46 we assume real functional dependence on time @xmath16 in the form of the solution @xmath56 to equation ( 18 ) , where @xmath57 is the amplitude of the density fluctuation and @xmath58 is applied external frequency .",
    "the substitution leads to the following condition for resonance    @xmath59    since @xmath60 , solving ( 19 ) with @xmath58 unknown and neglecting terms involving squares and higher powers of @xmath61 , we obtain for the plasma frequency    @xmath62    clearly the shift is dependent upon the rotational frequency and mass of the star , and also upon the angle of inclination @xmath30 .",
    "it follows from expression ( 7 ) that at the surface of the star @xmath63 , the gravitomagnetic force has magnitude given by    @xmath64    where @xmath65 , @xmath66 being the magnitude of the angular velocity vector . substituting from expression ( 21 ) into ( 20 )",
    "we obtain an expression relating plasma frequency @xmath67 to the angle @xmath68 :    @xmath69    here the requirements @xmath60 and @xmath70 are generally valid for typical compact stellar sources with @xmath71 ranging from @xmath72 ( for a typical white dwarf of mass @xmath73 , radius @xmath74 and angular frequency@xmath75 ) to @xmath76 ( for a typical neutron star of mass @xmath77 , radius @xmath78 , and angular frequency @xmath79 ) with corresponding plasma frequency ranging approximately @xmath80 to @xmath81 or above . denoting @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is given by ( 21 ) , we have in terms of plasma frequency we have the following expression for the index of refraction @xmath84 of the medium    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the angular frequency of waves ( e.g. electromagnetic ) propagating through the plasma ; whose transmission or reflection , for a given compact source , is determined by the usual conditions    @xmath87    @xmath88    the shift in plasma frequency in the equatorial plane ( @xmath89 ) is @xmath90 whereas in the plane orthogonal to it ( @xmath91 ) the shift is @xmath92 . denoting the frequency shift in the equatorial plane by @xmath93 and by @xmath94 for the orthogonal plane , we find that the maximum difference in the frequencies transmitted through the plasma :    @xmath95    in figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we give plots for the typical cases of neutron star , pulsar , and white dwarf , between the plasma frequency shift @xmath96 and the angle @xmath30 ( using expression ( 22 ) ) and between the plasma refractive index @xmath84 as a function of the angle @xmath30 ( using expression ( 23 ) ) respectively .",
    "in view of the above investigations we find that the ` gravitomagnetic oscillations ' have a coupling to the plasma oscillations which become especially effective at the plasma frequency .",
    "this is so even if the plasma co - rotates with the star mainly because of the fact , that the gravitomagnetic force as well as the electron oscillations are along the radial direction , as is evident from expression ( 3 ) and ( 8) . it is clear from figure ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) that the plasma frequency the gravitomagnetic force produces a reduction in the frequency , thus enhancing the refractive index of the plasma .",
    "further the dependence of the shift on component of the angular frequency vector of the gravitational source to the plane of oscillations of the plasma gives a difference in the refractive index , which results in changing the allowed range of frequencies transmitted through the plasma , by a maximum amount @xmath97 .",
    "for a typical white dwarf @xmath71 is approximately @xmath72 , for a typical pulsar @xmath98 and for a neutron star @xmath76 .",
    "the predicted difference in the frequency of radiation emitted by a compact star though still very small , may possibly be observed , for example in radiation spectra of various compact sources , as the observations become more refined .",
