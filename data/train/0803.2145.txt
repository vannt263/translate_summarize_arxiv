    "the inner radius , @xmath16 , could range from @xmath17  cm ( 230 light days ) to @xmath18  cm ( 460 light days ) .",

    "the model indicates that the evaporation radius would be about @xmath22  cm and so it is unlikely that this was the main cause of the cavity .",
    "instead , we invoke episodic mass loss .",
    "a large cavity due to episodic mass loss was also inferred in the mir study of sn  2002hh ( meikle et al .",

    "cm the dust temperature became too low to match the shape of the mir sed .",
    "also , above this radius the csm mass became increasingly implausible ( @xmath25m@xmath20 ) .",
    "satisfactory matches to the data could also be achieved with a range of wind outer radii , the main constraint here also being that the wind mass should stay within plausible bounds .",
    "+ the shell dust mass at 230  days reached @xmath26  m@xmath2 i.e. just a few per cent of the cool carbon mass available to form new amorphous carbon dust within the cds ( see above ) .",
    "if the dust mass continued to grow as specified by the exponential factor , it would asymptotically approach @xmath27  m@xmath2 .",
    "however , we have no evidence that the growth continued beyond 230  days . for the wind we give results for @xmath28  cm and @xmath29  cm , yielding a wind dust mass of @xmath30  m@xmath2 .",
    "this is close to the lower limit for the dust mass ( see above ) .",
    "these dust masses correspond to gas masses of @xmath31  m@xmath2 in the shell ( at 230  days ) and @xmath32  m@xmath2 in the wind , where @xmath33 is the dust - to - gas mass ratio . for the pre - existing dust ,",
    "the value is comparable to the dust and csm masses found by pozzo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and meikle et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the type  iip sn  2002hh .",
    "we note also that morris et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used iso observations extending to 200  @xmath11 m to infer 0.15  m@xmath2 of dust in the csm of eta car .",
    "thus , we consider the dust mass estimate for the sn  2006jc progenitor csm as being entirely plausible .",
    "the uv / optical optical depths are 3.7 and 0.019 for the shell dust and csm dust respectively .",
    "the rather large optical depth of the shell is in agreement with the increase in the extinction of a@xmath34 @xmath5 3 estimated from the steepening of the optical light curves .",
    "it confirms that the shell must have been essentially opaque to uv / optical photons explaining the disappearance of the broad ejecta lines and the almost complete attenuation of the red wings of the he  i lines .",
    "the low optical depth of the wind is in accord with the low extinction towards sn  2006jc . for the grain number density growth function ,",
    "@xmath35  days and @xmath36  days .",
    "the quite large value of @xmath37 is necessary to compensate for the rapid decline of the input sn light curve .",
    "this is , perhaps , a surprisingly long time given that it probably only took about 120  days for the shock to sweep through the shell .",
    "it may indicate that dust formation continued after the shock had departed the shell , or that the extent of the dust forming region was considerably greater than the @xmath38 of the shell radius that was adopted .",
    "+ in summary , we note that having achieved a satisfactory match to the @xmath8 band light curve , the model spontaneously ( a ) generated an appropriate condensation temperature in the cds at the right time , and ( b ) reproduced the @xmath13 band light curve .",
    "this was achieved using the actual supernova bolometric light curve as input , an amorphous carbon emissivity , a simple grain number density growth scenario , and a two - component spherically symmetric ir  echo model .",
    "the mir excess and the 493  day @xmath8-band point are satisfactorily reproduced by a dusty progenitor wind . given the nature of the progenitor system , this seems entirely plausible .",
    "it seems unlikely that the cool excess ir emission arose solely from dust formed in the same cds that produced the nir emission .",
    "it is also unlikely that the cool excess emission was produced by newly - formed ejecta dust powered by radioactive decay or by a reverse shock .",
    "in our view , a combination of ir  echoes from the cds dust and from a more extended dusty progenitor wind yield the most complete and convincing explanation for the ir behaviour of sn  2006jc .",
    "smith et al . ( 2008 ) find that only @xmath39  m@xmath2 of dust is needed to account for the nir luminosity . at the epoch of their observations ( 95  days , our epoch definition )",
    "we find a shell dust mass of @xmath40  m@xmath2 .",
    "we suspect that some of this factor of 18 discrepancy is due to the much larger grain radius , 0.3  @xmath11 m , used by smith et al .",
    "compared with our 0.005  @xmath11 m .",
    "inspection of draine & lee ( 1984 ) shows that for amorphous carbon , @xmath41 is about @xmath42 larger at @xmath43 m radius than for @xmath44 m , and so the larger grain size will yield the same luminosity with less than 30% of the mass .",
    "this is due to the increasing contribution of the magnetic dipole term to the emissivity as @xmath45 increases above 0.03  @xmath11 m . to our knowledge , grain growth calculations for a sn - shocked circumstellar shell have not yet been performed .",
    "however , we note that for grain growth in the sn ejecta environment the grain size is likely to be less than about 0.05  @xmath11 m",
    "( e.g. todini & ferrara , 2001 ; nozawa et al .",
    "it therefore seems possible that the dust mass of smith et al . required to account for the nir luminosity",
    "is an underestimate .",
    "in addition , a grain size as large as 0.3  @xmath11 m might not produce even the modest reddening within the optical region indicated by the optical light curves ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "+ smith et al . ( 2008 ) also suggest that the total dust mass produced in the cds over a time scale of 2 months could be as high as 1% of a solar mass or more , assuming that only the very hottest dust was detectable in the nir . our modelling ( see sect .",
    "4.7 ) indicates that at 150 days , the mass of newly - formed dust in the shell required to account for the nir flux is about @xmath46 m@xmath2 and the uv / optical depth is already around 2.5 . as we point out in sect .",
    "4.7 , this is consistent with the observed optical sn light curve behaviour .",
    "however , having @xmath50.01 m@xmath2 of dust within the cds would result in an enormous optical depth and the dust would totally block out the optical sn light .",
    "furthermore , the hot dust would lie on the _ inside _ of the cds ( heated by the sn luminosity ) and so the nir light would also be absorbed by the dust shell . however , as our observations show the sn remained detectable until @xmath5180 days and @xmath5490 days at optical and nir wavelengths , respectively .",
    "therefore , we find such an enormous dust mass unlikely . + sakon et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , tominaga et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and nozawa et al .",
    "( 2008 ) invoke dust condensation in the ejecta to account for the nir luminosity plus part of the mir luminosity .",
    "sakon et al .",
    "use a uniform , optically - thin ( in the nir ) dust sphere to estimate the dust mass and temperature at 220  days . while they do not indicate the size of this sphere , we find that , given their temperature of 800  k , the radius must be about @xmath47 cm . to reach this radius at 220  days would require a velocity of about 25,000  km / s .",
    "even assuming an exceptionally massive progenitor for sn  2006jc , it seems rather unlikely that refractory elements will exist at this velocity . the very early appearance of dust",
    "might also be taken as an argument against ejecta dust formation , but modelling by nozawa et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggests that about a solar mass of dust could have formed in the ejecta of sn  2006jc and that dust formation could have begun as early as 50  days .",
    "however , as they concede , it is difficult to see how effects such as clumping or destruction by high energy photons / electrons could account for the much smaller ( over 3 orders of magnitude ) observed mass .",
    "+ nozawa et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also argue that the lbv - ejected shell density would be too low for grains to nucleate .",
    "they base this on ( a ) the x - ray observations of immler et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and ( b ) the hydrodynamic calculations of tominaga et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . on the other hand , and as already pointed out in pozzo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for sn  1998s and in smith et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for sn 2006jc , the physics of the cds dust formation invoked here is reminiscent of the radiative shock of colliding winds of wolf - rayet stars which is known to be a dust - forming site ( usov 1991 ) .",
    "moreover , we have shown that a simple ir  echo model involving new dust in a cds and old dust in the progenitor wind can naturally account for the flux , the nir / mir sed and the evolution of the ir emission from sn  2006jc .",
    "as shown above , using an independently determined bolometric light curve and shell radius , the shape and rate of decline of the nir flux are produced naturally within the ir  echo scenario .",
    "in addition , the epoch predicted by the model at which dust condensation in the shell first becomes possible coincides with the epoch at which the nir excess first appeared .",
    "these results give us confidence in the reality of the ir  echo origin of the ir flux . within their ejecta condensation model ,",

    "( 2008 ) have argued against a nir  echo from pre - existing csm dust on the basis of the grain temperature and its decay timescale .",
    "however , we find that the temperature and decay timescale could indeed be accounted for within a single , pre - existing dust ir - echo scenario ( see fig .  7 ) . in our view , the key objections to a pre - existing dust ir  echo as the sole origin of the sn  2006jc ir behaviour are ( a ) the insufficient luminosity of the sn blc , ( b ) the delayed rise in the nir light curves , and ( c ) the late - time mir flux .",
    "smith et al .",
    "have also argued that a pre - existing dust ir  echo scenario would not account for the attenuation of the he  i line profiles .",
    "we agree that this is true for an echo from an extended progenitor wind .",
    "we also agree that the cds dust would be able to produce the observed he  i profile evolution .",
    "as we show , an ir  echo from this cds dust can account for the bulk of the near - ir emission from sn  2006jc .",
    "the dependence of the grain number density growth on its equilibrium temperature within the ir  echo model also explains why the ir excess did not appear earlier .",
    "( the time it took for the sn shock to reach the shell probably also constrained the epoch at which dust was able to condense . ) +",
    "the discovery of the ir excess in sn 2006jc has provided us with , for the first time , an opportunity to study in detail this phenomenon in an h - deprived sn .",
    "we have shown that the interaction of the ejecta outward shock with a dense shell of material ejected by the progenitor in an lbv - like outburst about two years prior to the sn explosion was able to produce a cds behind the forward shock by 55 days from the explosion .",
    "the intensity , sed and evolution of the ir flux together with other evidence leads us to propose that this emission was due to ir  echoes .",
    "the bulk of the nir flux came from newly - formed cds dust while a substantial and growing fraction of the mir flux came from pre - existing dust in the progenitor wind , probably lying beyond @xmath48  cm .",
    "the cds amorphous carbon dust mass was @xmath26  m@xmath2 which is just a few percent of the cool carbon mass of @xmath50.010.02 m@xmath2 at 120  days .",
    "this model explains the observed nir evolution , as well as providing enough extinction ( @xmath49 ) to account for the fast decline in the optical light curves , the attenuation of the red wings of the csm he  i emission lines , and also the disappearance of the ejecta lines .",
    "the mass of pre - existing dust in the wind was at least @xmath50  m@xmath2 . given the @xmath17  cm lower limit for @xmath16 derived for the pre - existing csm dust , and assuming a typical wolf rayet star wind velocity of 1000  km / s , we can infer that the episodic mass - loss phase ceased at least @xmath5200 years before the pre - sn outburst and the explosion of sn  2006jc . for the wind model results presented above ( table  5 )",
    "the mass loss would have taken place during the period 240950 years before the sn explosion , implying a mass - loss rate of @xmath51  m@xmath2/year .",
    "this is rather high for a wr star ( see e.g. eldridge et al .",
    "2006 ) , adding weight to the proposition that sn 2006jc had an unusual progenitor .",
    "+ the ir behaviour of sn  2006jc can be explained as a combination of ir  echoes from two manifestations of stellar mass loss and this work provides two main conclusions .",
    "firstly , it adds to the growing evidence that mass - loss from the _ progenitors _ of core - collapse supernovae could be a major source of dust in the universe .",
    "secondly , we have witnessed dust formation in yet another type of core - collapse supernova .",
    "furthermore , while dust condensation within the cds formed behind the ejecta inward shock ( in mainly ejecta material ) has been proposed before for one event ( sn 1998s ) , sn 2006jc is the first case with evidence for dust condensation in the cds behind the ejecta outward shock in the circumstellar material .",
    "finally , we note that two other events ( sne 1999cq and 2002ao ) of the same type ibn class have also shown steepening optical light curves , similar to those of sn 2006jc .",
    "this suggests that cds dust formation might well be a common characteristic in other events of this sn type ( see also smith et al .",
    "2008 and pastorello et al .",
    "however , once again , we have seen no direct evidence that the explosion of a supernova produces anything other than a very modest amount of dust .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for useful comments and s. valenti , l. zampieri and d. watson for helpful discussions .",
    "we also thank the cambridge astronomical survey unit ( casu ) for access to the reduced ukirt wfcam images .",
