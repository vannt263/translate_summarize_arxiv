    "given a real linear space @xmath10 , a function @xmath11 is called _ additive _ if it is a nontrivial fact that additive functions may satisfy further functional equations . among these particular additive functions",
    "the so - called derivations play an important role .",
    "an additive function @xmath12 is called a _ derivation _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) if it satisfies the ( first - order ) _ leibniz rule _ : putting @xmath13 into , we get @xmath14 , hence , by the @xmath15-homogeneity of additive functions , it follows that derivations vanish at rational numbers . therefore , assuming that @xmath10 is equipped with a hausdorff vector topology , the only continuous derivation is the identically zero function .",
    "it can be shown that derivations with weak regularity properties are necessarily continuous and consequently are identically equal to zero .",
    "on the other hand , there exists derivations that are discontinuous and henceforth very irregular ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , for any algebraic base @xmath16 of @xmath17 , and for any function @xmath18 , there exists a unique derivation @xmath12 such that @xmath19 .",
    "given a real - valued derivation @xmath20 , one can prove by induction that the iterates @xmath21 , @xmath22 , ",
    ", @xmath23 of @xmath7 satisfy the following higher - order leibniz rule :    motivated by this property , heyneman ",
    "sweedler @xcite introduced the notion of @xmath24th - order derivation ( in the context of functions mapping rings to modules , however , we will restrict ourselves only to real functions ) .",
    "given @xmath25 , a sequence of additive functions @xmath4 is termed a _ derivation of order @xmath24 _ , if @xmath26 and , for any @xmath27 , is fulfilled .    clearly , a pair @xmath28 is a first - order derivation if and only if @xmath7 is a derivation .",
    "more generally , if @xmath5 is a derivation , then the sequence @xmath29 is a derivation of order @xmath24 .",
    "however , if @xmath30 is a nontrivial derivation and @xmath31 , then @xmath32 is also an @xmath24th - order derivation where the last element is not the @xmath24th iterate of the derivation @xmath7 .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "on one hand , we study the additive solvability of the following system of functional equations : where and @xmath1 is a symmetric function such that @xmath2 whenever @xmath3 . on the other hand , we characterize the linear dependence and independence of the additive solutions @xmath4 of .",
    "we recall first a particular case of the following result of ebanks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) ( which generalizes a result of jessen  karpf ",
    "thorup @xcite ) :    as a trivial consequence of this result , we can characterize those two - variable functions that are identical to the leibniz difference of an additive function .",
    "applying for the function @xmath33 , is equivalent to the additivity of @xmath34 and , and reduces to .",
    "our first main result offers a sufficient condition on the recursive additive solvability of the functional equations .",
    "we deduce this result by using , however , we note that another proof could be elaborated applyin the results of gselmann @xcite .    using @xmath35 , the functional equation for @xmath36",
    "can be rewritten as thus , in view of , in order that there exist an additive function @xmath37 such that hold , it is necessary and sufficient that @xmath38 satisfy the conditions in .",
    "the symmetry of @xmath39 implies the symmetry , the additivity of @xmath40 results the biadditivity of @xmath41 .",
    "thus , it suffices to prove that @xmath38 also satisfies the second identity in .",
    "this is equivalent to showing that , for all fixed @xmath42 , the mapping @xmath43 is symmetric . using equations for @xmath44",
    ", we obtain the sum of the last three terms in the above expression is symmetric in @xmath45 .",
    "the symmetry of the first summand is the consequence of the symmetry of @xmath46 which follows from property .    in what follows",
    ", we describe the nowhere zero solutions of .",
    "define the function @xmath47 through the empty product being equal to @xmath48 , we have that @xmath49 .    to complete the proof",
    ", we have to show that , for any @xmath50 , this equivalent to proving that this identity trivially holds for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and for any @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 be fixed .",
    "we prove by induction on @xmath55 .",
    "assume that holds for @xmath56 .",
    "then , using , it follows that @xmath57 , hence yields for @xmath58 instead of @xmath59 .",
    "conversely , suppose that there exists a function @xmath60 such that then , for any @xmath61 with @xmath62 , we have which completes the proof .",
    "when @xmath39 is of the form , then reduces to the following statement .",
    "we note that if in the above corollary @xmath63 , then is equivalent to , that is @xmath64 is a derivation of order @xmath24 .",
    "the implication _ ( i)@xmath65(ii ) _ is obvious , because @xmath66 can be chosen as @xmath67 .    to prove _ ( ii)@xmath65(iii ) _ , assume that there exists an upper semicontinuous function @xmath68 such that @xmath69 and @xmath70 . then @xmath71 is a nonempty and open set .",
    "the inequality @xmath70 implies that @xmath72 , which proves that the range of @xmath73 can not be dense in @xmath10 .",
    "finally , suppose that @xmath74 . by the additivity of @xmath73 , the set @xmath75 is closed under addition and multiplication by rational numbers . therefore , the closure of @xmath75 is a proper closed linear subspace of @xmath10 .",
    "then , by the hahn",
    " banach theorem , there exists a nonzero continuous linear functional @xmath76 which vanishes on @xmath75 , i.e. , @xmath77 is satisfied .    by taking @xmath78",
    ", the above theorem immediately simplifies to the following consequence which characterizes the linear dependence of finitely many additive functions .    in the particular case of this corollary , namely when @xmath66 is an indefinite quadratic form , the equivalence of statements _ (",
    "i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ is the main result of the paper @xcite by kocsis .",
    "a former result in this direction is due to maksa and rtz @xcite : if two additive functions @xmath79 satisfy @xmath80 then @xmath73 and @xmath81 are linearly dependent .",
    "in this section we apply to the particular case when the additive functions are iterates of a real derivation . however , firstly we prove the following for higher order derivations .    applying to the additive functions @xmath82 @xmath83",
    ", it follows that _ ( i ) _ , _ ( ii ) _ and _ ( iii ) _ are equivalent . the implication _ ( iv)@xmath65(i ) _ is obvious since if @xmath84 , then _ ( i ) _ holds with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "thus , it remains to show that _",
    "( i ) _ implies _",
    "( iv)_. assume that _",
    "( i ) _ holds .",
    "then there exist a smallest @xmath87 and @xmath88 such that @xmath89 and this means that the equality can only hold for @xmath90 .",
    "putting @xmath96 into , it follows that @xmath97 .",
    "if @xmath98 , then @xmath99 can not be zero , hence we obtain that @xmath100 .",
    "thus , we may assume that the minimal @xmath101 for which is satisfied is non - smaller than @xmath102 .",
    "replacing @xmath103 by @xmath104 in and applying , for all @xmath105 , we get by the minimality of @xmath101 , it follows from the above equality that , for all @xmath42 , again , by the minimality of @xmath101 , this implies that @xmath106 for @xmath107 with @xmath108 . by the assumption of the theorem , for all @xmath109 there exists @xmath110 such that @xmath111 . thus , @xmath112 . therefore , by , @xmath99 can not be equal to zero . then simplifies to @xmath100 , which was to be proved .",
