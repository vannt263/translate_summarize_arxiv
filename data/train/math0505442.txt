    "in a series of papers by hatcher and thurston @xcite , floyd and hatcher @xcite , and hatcher and oertel  @xcite , the set of incompressible , boundary incompressible surfaces in the complement of a 2-bridge knot or link , or a montesinos knot , are completely described and classified . in the case of knots , these papers also describe the possible boundary slopes that occur and in @xcite a table of all boundary slopes of montesinos knots with 10 or fewer crossings is given .",
    "unfortunately , this table contains several errors .",
    "however a corrected table has been published by dunfield  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the computer program written and used by dunfield is available at http://www.computop.org .",
    "while floyd and hatcher explicitly describe all incompressible surfaces in the complement of a 2-bridge link , they do not compute the boundary slopes of these surfaces , saying only that it should be possible in principle . in his ph.d .",
    "thesis  @xcite , lash starts with their construction and shows how to compute the associated boundary slopes .",
    "his ultimate goal was to compare the set of boundary slopes of the whitehead link , @xmath1 , to those predicted by the algebraic - geometric machinery of culler - shalen @xcite . applying his algorithm to @xmath1 , lash was able to show that in this case , every boundary slope arises from a degenerating sequence of representations of the link group into @xmath2 .",
    "ohtsuki @xcite has shown this to be true for all 2-bridge knots ( excluding slopes that correspond to a fiber in a fibration ) , but the question remains open for all 2-bridge links in general . to investigate this question",
    "it would obviously be helpful to have boundary slope data for all 2-bridge links .",
    "unfortunately , lash s thesis has never been published and tables of boundary slopes of links have not been available .    in this paper we describe lash s algorithm and develop an improved algorithm that is easier to use .",
    "this allows us to describe the types of boundary slopes that can occur . as an illustration of our techniques ,",
    "we compute the boundary slopes of the @xmath3 2-bridge links . these links",
    "may also be described as @xmath0 surgery on one component of the borromean rings . for this class of links , we have found an explicit description of their eigenvalue varieties and in a forthcoming paper will investigate the relationship between the actual boundary slopes and those detected by the eigenvalue variety .",
    "we have written a computer program to implement our algorithm and include here a table of boundary slopes of all 2-bridge links up to 10 crossings . in our table , links through 9 crossings are also identified by their index in rolfsen s table @xcite .",
    "our program , as well as a much larger table to 16 crossings , will eventually be available at http://www.computop.org and as part of _ knotscape _",
    "@xcite .    in section  [ section : floydandhatcher ]",
    "we briefly describe floyd and hatcher s construction for 2-bridge links .",
    "the reader is referred to their original paper for more detail . then in section  [ section : lash ] we describe lash s algorithm for finding the boundary slopes of a given 2-bridge link using floyd and hatcher s construction . in section  [ section : improvedalgorithm ]",
    "we improve the algorithm and discuss some of its theoretical consequences .",
    "the next section includes a nice example for the infinite family of 2-bridge links already mentioned above .",
    "finally , in section  [ section : table ] we tabulate boundary slope data for all 2-bridge links with 10 or less crossings .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be relatively prime positive integers such that @xmath6 , @xmath4 is odd , and @xmath5 is even .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the standard 2-bridge diagram of the 2-bridge link @xmath7 .",
    "for example , @xmath8 is shown in figure  [ figure:2-bridge link diagram ] .",
    "it is important to note that our definition of @xmath7 agrees with that of @xcite and @xcite , but is the mirror image of the more conventional depiction of @xmath7 with the `` ( straight ) bridges on top . ''",
    "see for example , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "viewing @xmath9 as the 2-point compactification of @xmath10 , we may place @xmath7 in @xmath11 so that it meets @xmath12 and @xmath13 each in two arcs , and each intermediate level in four points .",
    "we may think of each level , @xmath14 , as the quotient @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the group generated by @xmath17 rotations of @xmath18 about the integer lattice points @xmath19 .",
    "the four points of the link at each intermediate level are precisely the four points of @xmath20 .",
    "the arcs at level @xmath21 are the image of the lines in @xmath18 which pass through integer lattice points with slope @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , the two arcs at level @xmath23 are the image of vertical lines through integer lattice points . finally , psl@xmath24 acts linearly on each level , leaving @xmath20 invariant .",
    "floyd and hatcher next describe four basic branched surfaces , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , copies of which will be stacked , one on top of the other , to build a branched surface spanning the 2-bridge link .",
    "actually it is not these surfaces exactly , but rather homeomorphic images of them , that will be compressed vertically and stacked together . to understand the floyd and hatcher construction , and lash s computation of the boundary slopes , we need to first understand these four basic building blocks .",
    "beautiful illustrations of the four surfaces are given in @xcite which we will not attempt to reproduce here .",
    "instead , we describe the surfaces in a different fashion .",
    "each is contained in @xmath11 . in both of the half - intervals @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath28 $ ] the surface is a product of the half - interval with a finite number of disjoint embedded arcs in the 2-sphere with endpoints at the four points of @xmath20 .",
    "the transversality of the surface with the horizontal levels completely degenerates at the @xmath29-level , where branching occurs which allows the arc system at the @xmath30-level to transition to the arc system at the @xmath31-level .",
    "figure  [ figure : branchedsurfaces ] shows cross - sections of each branched surface at heights @xmath32 , and @xmath31 . at the @xmath29-level",
    "the shaded areas indicate horizontal parts of the surface .",
    "each of the four branched surfaces can carry a variety of embedded surfaces in the usual way indicated by the number of sheets , or weights , on each piece of the branched surface .",
    "the weights are also indicated in figure  [ figure : branchedsurfaces ] as well as arrows at the @xmath29-level which indicate the direction of branching as one moves up from the @xmath30-level to the @xmath31-level .",
    "finally , notice that all the surfaces shown in figure  [ figure : branchedsurfaces ] carry the implicit assumption that @xmath33 ( and sometimes that @xmath34 and @xmath35 have the same parity ) .",
    "if @xmath36 is any element of psl@xmath24 , let @xmath37 .",
    "we may take @xmath11 to itself with the homeomorphism @xmath38id and carry any one of the four basic surfaces to a new branched surface that begins and ends at arc systems with slopes depending on @xmath39 .",
    "images like this of the four basic surfaces can then be joined together vertically provided they have matching arc systems where they are attached . in this way we can piece together a branched surface that begins with the two arcs of @xmath40 at level 0 of slope @xmath41 and ends with the two arcs of @xmath40 at level 1 of slope @xmath42 . for example ,",
    "suppose we begin with the hopf link , @xmath43 .",
    "we wish to piece together a branched surface that starts at slope @xmath41 and ends at slope @xmath29 . starting with a copy of @xmath44",
    "we may move from two arcs at slope @xmath41 to an arc system consisting of three arcs : one at slope @xmath41 and two at slope @xmath45 .",
    "we may then attach to this an upside - down copy of @xmath26 which then takes us to an arc system of three arcs : two at slope @xmath45 and one at slope @xmath29 .",
    "finally , we will end with an upside - down copy of @xmath44 transformed by @xmath38id where @xmath46 .",
    "notice that the linear transformation @xmath47 takes lines of slope @xmath41 to lines of slope @xmath29 and lines of slope @xmath45 to lines of slope @xmath45 , because @xmath48 therefore , the upside - down copy of @xmath44 transformed by @xmath38id ends with the desired arc system of two arcs of slope @xmath29",
    ".    there is a beautiful correspondence between branched surfaces constructed in this way and continued fraction expansions of @xmath22 which in turn may be viewed as paths in the following diagrams .",
    "consider first the tessellation @xmath49 of @xmath50 by ideal triangles shown in figure  [ figure : d0andd1 ] .",
    "the rationals , together with @xmath41 , are arranged around the unit circle as shown , and two fractions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are connected by a geodesic if and only if @xmath53 .",
    "( this diagram contains the stern - brocot tree generated from @xmath41 and @xmath45 by adding fractions the `` wrong way '' according to the ( mis)rule @xmath54 .",
    "see @xcite , for example . )",
    "the group of orientation preserving symmetries of @xmath49 is psl@xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath55 be the subgroup of mobius transformations given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is even .",
    "it follows that the triangle @xmath58 is a fundamental domain for the action of @xmath59 and the @xmath59-images of the ideal quadralateral @xmath60 tessellate @xmath50 .",
    "if we delete the @xmath59-orbit of the diagonal @xmath61 and replace it with the @xmath59-orbit of the opposite diagonal @xmath62 , we obtain a new diagram called @xmath63 , which is also shown in figure  [ figure : d0andd1 ]",
    ".    between @xmath63 and @xmath49 there exists a family of oriented diagrams @xmath64 , for @xmath65 , obtained by expanding each diagonal in @xmath49 ( labeled c in figure  [ figure : d0andd1 ] ) to a rectangle which may then be collapsed to the opposite diagonal ( labeled d in figure  [ figure : d0andd1 ] ) , thus giving @xmath63 .",
    "the intersection of each of @xmath66 , and @xmath49 with the fundamental quadralateral @xmath67 is shown in figure  [ figure : quadindt ] .",
    "the edges of @xmath64 fall into four @xmath59-orbits which are named @xmath68 , and @xmath69 and which have , respectively , representative edges @xmath70 and @xmath63 as defined in figure  [ figure : quadindt ] . as @xmath71 the edges degenerate into @xmath72 and @xmath69-type edges in @xmath63 .",
    "if instead , @xmath73 , the edges degenerate into @xmath74 and @xmath75-type edges in @xmath49 .",
    "we may orient the edges of @xmath64 by using the orientations of @xmath70 and @xmath63 shown in figure  [ figure : quadindt ] , but there is no coherent way to orient the edges of @xmath63 or @xmath49 .",
    "finally , by setting @xmath76 for @xmath77 , we obtain a diagram for every @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "floyd and hatcher show that the diagram @xmath64 provides a beautiful way of describing all the incompressible surfaces in the 2-bridge link exteriors . in particular , _ minimal edge paths _ in @xmath64 from @xmath41 to @xmath42",
    "will correspond to branched surfaces which in turn will carry the incompressible surfaces .",
    "an edge path in @xmath64 is _ minimal _ if it never contains two consecutive edges that lie in the same triangle or rectangle of @xmath64 .",
    "it is not hard to see that a minimal edge path in @xmath64 ( with @xmath79 ) will collapse to a minimal edge path in either @xmath63 or @xmath49 as @xmath80 approaches 0 or 1 respectively .",
    "moreover , these limiting paths in @xmath63 and @xmath49 uniquely determine the path in @xmath64 .",
    "for a particular fraction @xmath42 there can only be a finite number of minimal edge paths connecting it to @xmath41 .",
    "this follows from the fact that these minimal paths are all contained in a unique minimal chain of quadralaterals consisting of @xmath67 and a finite number of its translates under @xmath59 .",
    "each minimal edge path in @xmath64 ( with @xmath81 ) from @xmath41 to @xmath42 provides a recipe for piecing together images of the four basic surfaces @xmath25 , and @xmath26 as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath82 is a path consisting of consecutive edges @xmath83 .",
    "for each edge @xmath84 there exists an element @xmath85 taking @xmath86 to @xmath84 , where @xmath86 is one of the four representative edges @xmath70 , or @xmath63 in @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath87 be @xmath25 , or @xmath26 depending on whether @xmath86 is @xmath70 , or @xmath63 respectively .",
    "now take @xmath87 to @xmath88 , rescaling vertically so as to place the image in @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "moreover , if the orientation of @xmath90 is opposite that of @xmath84 , we first reflect @xmath87 through the 2-sphere @xmath91 before applying @xmath92 .",
    "if @xmath80 is rational and equal to the reduced fraction @xmath93 , we can further use this information to assign weights to the branched surface as follows .",
    "if @xmath94 the branched surface is weighted as shown in figure  [ figure : branchedsurfaces ] .",
    "if instead , @xmath65 the above construction is altered by first rotating each of the basic surfaces @xmath25 , and @xmath26 through @xmath17 in the obvious way so as to interchange the two components of @xmath7 .",
    "we then swap @xmath34 and @xmath35 and proceed as before .",
    "thus for every minimal edge path in @xmath64 with @xmath80 a positive rational number different from @xmath31 , we have associated a weighted branched surface and thus an actual surface in the complement of the link .",
    "if @xmath95 , or @xmath96 we must modify this recipe slightly .",
    "if we let @xmath80 approach zero or infinity , then the above constructions will limit at surfaces for which @xmath97 or @xmath98 respectively .",
    "but the limiting surfaces which arise from the above constructions when @xmath99 do not give all desired surfaces with @xmath100 . instead , the process must be modified slightly . as @xmath101 the minimal edge paths in @xmath64 approach minimal edge paths in @xmath49 that consist entirely of @xmath74 or @xmath75-type edges .",
    "returning to figure  [ figure : branchedsurfaces ] , notice that if @xmath102 , then @xmath44 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 are isotopic .",
    "thus if @xmath75-type edges are involved , then @xmath44 allows for more general branching than @xmath104 and for this reason we replace each use of @xmath104 with @xmath44 .    finally , the main result of floyd and hatcher is the following theorem .",
    "the orientable incompressible and meridionally incompressible surfaces in @xmath105 , without peripheral components , are exactly ( up to isotopy ) the orientable surfaces carried by the collection of branched surfaces associated to minimal edge paths in @xmath64 from @xmath41 to @xmath42 and with @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "recall from @xcite that a surface @xmath107 in the complement of the link @xmath108 is _ meridionally incompressible _",
    "if whenever there is a disk @xmath109 with @xmath110 and such that @xmath69 meets @xmath108 transversely in one interior point , then there exists a disk @xmath111 with @xmath112 and such that @xmath113 also meets @xmath108 transversely in a single interior point .",
    "floyd and hatcher then go on to explicitly describe when two surfaces constructed in this way are isotopic .",
    "however , they do not compute the boundary slopes of these surfaces , saying only that it should be possible in principle .",
    "the boundary of a branched surface derived from the floyd - hatcher construction defines a train track on the boundary of the regular neighborhood of the link .",
    "thus the boundary of any incompressible surface carried by the branched surface is carried by this train track .",
    "lash s first step is to determine the train tracks for each of the four basic surfaces @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    before doing this",
    ", we introduce some notation .",
    "let the four points of @xmath20 be @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "at the 0-level , assume that the two arcs of @xmath7 join the points @xmath116 to @xmath117 and @xmath117 to @xmath115 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath118 where @xmath119 contains @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "orient @xmath119 so that it runs vertically upward from @xmath116 and orient @xmath120 so that it runs vertically upward from @xmath115 .",
    "choose as a fundamental domain of @xmath15 the region @xmath121 \\times [ -1/2 , 3/2]$ ] .",
    "removing small disks of radius @xmath122 centered at the four points of @xmath123 will remove semi - disks from the fundamental domain @xmath124 .",
    "these correspond to meridional cross sections of the regular neighborhood of the link .",
    "let @xmath125 be the oriented meridian of @xmath119 having linking number @xmath126 with @xmath119 .",
    "let @xmath127 be the oriented longitude of @xmath119 defined as follows",
    ". start with the line segment from @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
    "join to this the vertical segments @xmath130 $ ] and @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "next , add the curve in @xmath132 which starts at @xmath133 , ends at @xmath134 , and is parallel to @xmath119 . finally , orient @xmath127 parallel to @xmath119 .",
    "the @xmath17 rotation of figure  [ figure:2-bridge link diagram ] about the vertical axis @xmath135 interchanges the components of the link , and preserves their orientations .",
    "we define the oriented meridian @xmath136 and longitude @xmath137 of @xmath120 as the images of @xmath125 and @xmath127 respectively under this rotation .",
    "we will initially compute all boundary slopes with respect to the basis @xmath138 .",
    "however , @xmath139 is not necessarily a preferred longitude of @xmath140 so it will be necessary later to know its linking number with @xmath140 .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to compute this .",
    "we obtain @xmath141\\ ! ] } \\label{eqn : linkingnumber}\\ ] ] where @xmath142\\!]$ ] is the greatest integer less than or equal to @xmath143 .",
    "note , for example , that @xmath139 is never the preferred longitude if @xmath5 is a multiple of 4 since the linking number must be odd in this case .",
    "figure  [ fig : traintracks ] depicts the train track boundaries of each of the four basic branched surfaces .",
    "each row of the figure shows the train tracks on the boundary of each of the four `` columns '' which are the regular neighborhoods of the vertical segments of the link .",
    "these are depicted in the corresponding regions of @xmath144 $ ] , that is , the product of the semicircular arcs surrounding each integer lattice point with the unit interval @xmath145 $ ] .",
    "notice that we have used slopes ranging from @xmath146 to @xmath96 to parameterize the semicircular arcs .",
    "thus we see the train tracks for @xmath44 , on each of the four columns , begin at slopes of @xmath147 and end at slopes of @xmath147 and @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , the train tracks for @xmath104 , on all four columns , have curves that begin at slopes of @xmath31 and end at slopes of @xmath30 .",
    "suppose @xmath148 is a branched surface obtained by piecing together homeomorphic copies of the four basic branched surfaces and that @xmath107 is a surface carried by @xmath148 . because @xmath148 corresponds to a path in @xmath64 from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , @xmath148 will always begin with a copy of @xmath44 and end with an upside - down copy of @xmath44 .",
    "let the initial weights on @xmath148 at the 0-level be @xmath34 and @xmath35 as shown in figure  [ figure : branchedsurfaces ] .",
    "thus , at the 0-level on the neighborhood of @xmath119 , the boundary of @xmath107 consists of @xmath149 arcs .",
    "if we orient one of these arcs in the direction of @xmath119 and follow it upward , it will follow the train track up the @xmath116 column until it reaches the top , traverse a curve of slope @xmath42 at the 1-level , and then follow the train track down the @xmath117 column . in figure",
    "[ fig : traintracks ] we have chosen to orient the train tracks parallel to @xmath119 and @xmath120 for this reason .",
    "when we return to our starting point at the bottom we may end there , or perhaps continue to travel around again in the longitudinal direction .",
    "if the boundary of @xmath107 consists of several components , we may orient them all parallel to @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( even if these orientations are not compatible with an orientation of @xmath107 ) .",
    "suppose @xmath150 has @xmath151 components on the regular neighborhood of @xmath119 and that each has algebraic ( and geometric ) intersection of @xmath152 with @xmath125 .",
    "thus @xmath153 furthermore , suppose each has algebraic intersection @xmath154 with @xmath127 .",
    "then @xmath155 for all @xmath156 and moreover , because the components of @xmath150 are all disjoint and nontrivial , each boundary slope @xmath157 is the same . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath152 and @xmath154 are constant , say @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "thus to determine the boundary slope @xmath160 we need only compute the total algebraic intersection @xmath161 of @xmath150 with @xmath127 and divide by @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , the boundary slope of @xmath107 on the regular neighborhood of @xmath120 is @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the total algebraic intersection of @xmath150 with @xmath137 .",
    "again , these boundary slopes are with respect to the basis @xmath164 .    to compute @xmath165",
    "we must sum the algebraic intersection of the oriented train tracks with @xmath127 on columns @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "we may do this one section at a time , with each section coming from one of the four basic surfaces .",
    "we may simplify matters by pulling back @xmath127 under the inverse of @xmath38id and counting its intersection with the standard train tracks shown in figure  [ fig : traintracks ] , rather than examining the images of the standard train tracks under @xmath38id .",
    "if @xmath36 then @xmath166 and the vector @xmath167 , which represents a slope of @xmath96 ( and the longitude @xmath127 ) , pulls back to the vector @xmath168 , which represents a slope of @xmath169 .",
    "thus we must examine how the standard train tracks intersect the vertical line located at slope @xmath169 .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath82 is a minimal edge path in @xmath64 beginning at @xmath41 and ending at @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath84 be an edge of @xmath82 that is the image of @xmath170 under the element @xmath171 of @xmath59 . furthermore",
    ", suppose that the orientations of @xmath84 and @xmath172 agree .",
    "if @xmath173 then the algebraic intersection on column @xmath116 is @xmath174 and on column @xmath117 is @xmath175 .",
    "note that on column @xmath116 the meridian runs from @xmath30 towards @xmath96 while on column @xmath117 the meridian runs from @xmath30 to @xmath146 .",
    "this explains the minus signs in the above calculations .",
    "the total contribution to @xmath165 at this level , in this case , is thus @xmath176 .",
    "if instead , @xmath177 , we obtain @xmath178 on column @xmath116 and @xmath179 on column @xmath117 for a total contribution to @xmath165 of @xmath35 .",
    "note that @xmath169 can not be zero .",
    "this is because @xmath57 is even and therefore both @xmath180 and @xmath181 must be odd since @xmath182 .",
    "however , @xmath169 may equal @xmath147 if @xmath183 . in this case",
    "the train track is not transverse to the ( pullback of the ) longitude .",
    "when this occurs , we may istotope the longitude slightly by pushing it in the positive direction of @xmath125 .",
    "so in this case , if @xmath184 we obtain an intersection on column @xmath116 of @xmath185 and on column @xmath117 of @xmath175 for a net contribution to @xmath165 of zero .",
    "table  [ table : m1andm2 ] lists these results together with the contributions to @xmath165 for the other three types of surfaces , all in the case where the orientations of @xmath84 and @xmath90 agree .",
    "if these orientations are opposite , then we must flip each surface upside - down and it is easy to see that the effect is to negate the entries in the table .",
    "a similar examination of the standard train tracks allows us to compute @xmath163 .",
    "however in this case an additional consideration seems necessary . for any @xmath186 , @xmath47 takes @xmath116 to itself and @xmath117 to itself since @xmath57 is even and both @xmath180 and @xmath181 are odd .",
    "but if @xmath187 is odd , then @xmath188 and @xmath115 will be traded while if @xmath187 is even these lattice points will each be fixed .",
    "thus it seems necessary to consider these cases separately .",
    "however , a close examination of the case when @xmath187 is odd reveals that both the orientations of the train tracks as well as the orientation of @xmath136 are reversed and the total contribution to @xmath163 is unaffected .",
    "thus separate formulae for @xmath187 even or odd are not needed .",
    "the results for each of the four basic surfaces are listed in table  [ table : m1andm2 ]",
    ".        surface type & @xmath165 & @xmath163&@xmath169 + @xmath74 &    .contributions to @xmath165 and @xmath163 according to surface type . [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     [ table : finalslopes ]",
    "we have written a computer program to implement the algorithm described in section  [ section : improvedalgorithm ] .",
    "one begins by finding all minimal paths in @xmath63 and @xmath49 from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "these determine the minimal paths in @xmath64 .",
    "each minimal path @xmath82 in @xmath64 is then deformed into a path @xmath189 of only @xmath74 and @xmath72-type edges .",
    "lemma  [ lemma : aandbonly ] is used to compute @xmath190 and @xmath191 is derived from this using lemma  [ lemma : pathmovest ] . in order to minimize the chance of producing errors , each of us coded a program independent of the other with debugging proceeding until our results agreed .",
    "the second tait conjecture states that any reduced alternating diagram of a link is minimal .",
    "thus is it easy to determine the crossing number of @xmath7 . if we express @xmath22 as the continued fraction @xmath192 $ ] where each @xmath193 is positive , then @xmath7 has a reduced alternating 4-plat diagram with @xmath194 crossings .",
    "thus the crossing number of @xmath7 is @xmath194 .",
    "it is now a simple matter to determine all 2-bridge links with 10 or fewer crossings by finding all such continued fractions .",

    "the boundary slopes of all 2-bridge links having ten or less crossings are presented in tables  [ data2to8]-[data10c ] .",
    "all slopes are with respect to a preferred longitude and meridian basis . for those links with 9 or less crossings ,",
    "the index of the link in rolfsen s table @xcite is also given .",
    "two types of data are listed .",
    "first , all boundary slopes in the case where @xmath195 are given .",
    "from these the slopes with @xmath65 can then be determined as described earlier .",
    "furthermore , one may then derive from these all boundary slopes in the cases @xmath196 and @xmath197 and some of the boundary slopes in the case @xmath198 .",
    "finally , all additional slopes in the case @xmath198 are given in terms of the rational parameter @xmath199 with @xmath200 ."
