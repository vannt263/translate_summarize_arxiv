    "special attention has been given to the classification of shifts of finite type up to flow equivalence ; in that context , complete and decidable algebraic invariants were obtained in the irreducible case  @xcite .",
    "complete algebraic invariants were also obtained in the reducible case  @xcite . however , as pointed out in  , only small progress have been made in the strictly sofic case , where one finds few useful flow equivalence invariants , even for irreducible shifts .",
    "the role of the syntactic semigroup of the language of finite blocks of a shift @xmath1 , which we call the _ syntactic semigroup of @xmath1 _ , has been considered in the literature   essentially in the context of ( strictly ) sofic shifts . in  , one finds a characterization of the abstract semigroups which are the syntactic semigroup of an irreducible sofic shift .    for a semigroup @xmath2 , let @xmath3 be the karoubi envelope ( also known as cauchy completion or idempotent splitting ) of @xmath2 .",
    "it is a certain small category that plays a crucial role in finite semigroup theory thanks in part to the delay theorem of tilson ( see  @xcite , where @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 . )    for a shift @xmath1 , let @xmath5 be its syntactic semigroup . in this paper",
    "we prove that the karoubi envelope @xmath6 ( more briefly denoted @xmath7 ) is , up to equivalence of categories , a flow equivalence invariant of @xmath1 .",
    "this says , in a sense to be made more precise , that @xmath1 determines @xmath8 up to morita equivalence .",
    "we also show that among sofic shifts this is the best possible syntactic invariant of flow equivalence , as every flow equivalence invariant of sofic shifts which is also invariant under isomorphism of syntactic semigroups is shown to factor through the equivalence relation identifying shifts with equivalent karoubi envelopes .",
    "the category @xmath7 is of little use when dealing with shifts of finite type .",
    "indeed , a shift of finite type is conjugate with an edge shift , and it is easy to see that if @xmath1 is an irreducible edge shift then @xmath5 is isomorphic to a brandt semigroup @xmath9 for some @xmath10  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2.23 ) .",
    "unfortunately , all finite brandt semigroups have equivalent karoubi envelopes .",
    "however , for other classes , including strictly sofic shifts , we do obtain interesting results .",
    "we also investigate the actions of the category @xmath7 on the krieger cover of @xmath1 and , if @xmath1 is synchronizing , on its fischer cover .",
    "we show that these actions are invariant under flow equivalence .",
    "as seen in section  [ sec : prop - comun - graph ] , this enables a new proof of the invariance under flow equivalence of the proper communication graph of a sofic shift ( a result from  ) .    in section  [ sec :",
    "label - preord - set ] , we provide examples of pairs of almost finite type shifts @xmath1 and @xmath11 such that @xmath7 and @xmath12 are not equivalent , whereas other flow equivalence invariants fail to separate them . in the first of these examples we use a labeled poset , derived from green s relations on @xmath5 , which was shown in  @xcite to be a conjugacy invariant of sofic shifts .",
    "this is a more refined version of an invariant previously considered in  .    in section",
    "[ sec : classes - sofic - shifts ] we see further examples of how the karoubi envelope can be used to show that some classes of shifts are closed under flow equivalence .",
    "in particular we deduce again that the class of almost finite type shifts is stable under flow equivalence , a result from  .",
    "the karoubi envelope is applied in section  [ sec : markov - dyck - shifts ] to classify up to flow equivalence two classes of non - sofic shifts , the markov - dyck and the markov - motzkin shifts of krieger and matsumoto  , thus reproving and generalizing the classification of dyck shifts , first obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the karoubi envelope is also used in section  [ sec : shifts - with - kriegers ] to give a new perspective on the class of shifts with property ( @xmath0 ) , introduced by wolfgang krieger in  @xcite , and also studied in  .",
    "the semigroup which krieger associated to each shift with property ( @xmath0 ) is shown to be encapsulated in the karoubi envelope . from that result one",
    "deduces the invariance , recently announced by krieger , of such semigroup under flow equivalence , assuming the density of a special subset of the shift , an assumption which is usually made when studying property ( @xmath0 ) shifts .",
    "the interpretation in terms of the karoubi envelope is also used to show that property ( @xmath0 ) is decidable for sofic shifts and to construct the first examples of sofic shifts without propert ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the poset of subsynchronizing subshifts of a sofic shift was shown in  @xcite to be a conjugacy invariant of sofic shifts , with the aim of studying the structure of reducible sofic shifts .",
    "in section  [ sec : subsynchr - subsh - sofi ] this invariance is recovered and extended to flow equivalence , using the karoubi envelope .",
    "the basic outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin with two sections of preliminaries .",
    "the first contains some aspects of category theory and semigroup theory that we shall require in order to extract flow equivalence invariants from the category @xmath7 .",
    "the second preliminary section is about symbolic dynamics .",
    "section  [ sec : stat - main - results ] states our main results . in sections  [ sec : prop - comun - graph ] to  [ sec : subsynchr - subsh - sofi ] , consequences of our main results are explored , as well as relations with previous work , from the viewpoint of the classification of shifts up to flow equivalence . although the principal motivation in this paper is the study of flow equivalence , we also deduce in section  [ sec : eventual - conjugacy ] that the karoubi envelope is an invariant of eventual conjugacy in the case of sofic shifts .",
    "the proofs of the main results are left to sections  [ sec : proof - theor - reft : m ] and  [ sec : master ] .",
