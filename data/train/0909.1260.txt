    "@xcite the poincar sections of a @xmath32 and of a @xmath31 torus , respectively , are presented .",

    "@xcite reports the existence of three - frequency quasiperiodicity in a ring of coupled lorenz oscillators ( in a different parameter regime ) , while a case of a third very low frequency associated to a @xmath31 torus has been observed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in trying to justify the robust existence of @xmath31 dynamics in the light of the nrt theorem ,",
    "a first observation is that in our simulations we have not detected resonances in the @xmath32 regime .",
    "this may occur due to the fact that along @xmath27 , the winding number does not crosses hard resonances , the smallest denominator is @xmath49 ( corresponding to a winding number of @xmath50 ) , so the resonance horns may be quite small .",
    "but also it is important to notice that the absence of resonances in rotating waves is a characteristic feature of systems with rotational , @xmath51 , symmetry  @xcite .",
    "for instance in a homogeneous excitable medium , the compound rotation of a spiral wave lacks of frequency lockings due to this symmetry  @xcite",
    ". therefore the stability of the @xmath31 attractors would be subsequent to the robustness of the quasiperiodic dynamics on the two - tori . in a sense",
    "our three - frequency quasiperiodic attractors would be as robust as two - frequency quasiperiodic attractors .",
    "it is clear that in our system this rotational symmetry is only approximate , but one may consider the discreteness effect as a small perturbation .",
    "also the third frequency is very small what precludes strong resonances with small denominators : thus , for @xmath35 [ fig .",
    "[ fig1osc](c ) ] we have @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "these arguments support the existence of a range of three - frequency quasiperiodic behavior .",
    "in this section we are going to analyze the route through which a chaotic attractor is born in this system .",
    "first of all , we shall reduce the dimensionality of the problem by eliminating the fast frequency , namely the one involved in the phase shift by @xmath23 in neighbor oscillators , as it leads to a conserved quantity ( this time lag ) and consequently a vanishing ( or almost vanishing ) lyapunov exponent . in the mode representation of eq .",
    "( [ eqmod ] ) this amounts to perform a cut through the poincar section @xmath55 .",
    "so , in visualizing objects cycles will become fixed points , @xmath32-tori cycles and @xmath31-tori will become @xmath32-tori , although we shall refer to these objects corresponding to the complete phase space , and not to the result of the dimensionality reduction achieved via sectioning .",
    "the first important remark about our system of three coupled lorenz oscillators is that the two @xmath31 attractors are not directly involved in the birth of the high - dimensional chaotic attractor .",
    "continuation of the @xmath31 attractors shows that they exist above @xmath56 .",
    "this implies that the system exhibits multistability between the high - dimensional chaotic and the @xmath31 attractors in the range @xmath57 , with the latter attractors having a small basin of attraction .",
    "this remark is important , because it implies that the high - dimensional chaotic attractor is not created through some route involving the @xmath31 attractors .",
    "attractors in the region in which they coexist with the chaotic attractor .",
    "the fourth lyapunov exponent approaches zero in a square - root fashion , as expected for a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "]    a detailed view of the behavior of the four largest lyapunov exponents for the @xmath31 attractors is represented in fig .",
    "[ lyapunovd ] .",
    "it can be seen that close to @xmath58 the fourth lyapunov exponent exhibits a square - root profile as expected for a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "this suggests that each @xmath31 attractor is approaching an unstable @xmath31 .",
    "also one can appreciate quite clear lockings where the third and fourth lyapunov exponents become equal .    as @xmath27 approaches @xmath58 the existence of a smooth invariant 3d - torus",
    "can not be guaranteed , because the strength of the normal contraction can be of the same order than the rate of attraction of the 2d - torus arising in each locking @xcite .",
    "thus , in fig .  [ slave_locking ] a possible scenario for the interaction of the tori , that would explain the lockings observed in fig .",
    "[ lyapunovd ] is presented .",
    "because of the extremely small transversal stability of the @xmath31 ( represented by the fourth exponent ) , for @xmath59 , we conjecture that the transversal direction ` slaves ' the tangential one ( represented by the third exponent ) .",
    "then , we observe two identical non - vanishing exponents that may indicate the existence of a stable focus - type @xmath32 on the surface of the @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath31 continues to exist but is non - differentiable at the stable @xmath32 located on its ( hyper)surface .",
    "the participation of the unstable 3d - torus in the final annihilation of the stable one is not trivial ( the existence of the unstable @xmath31 is supported by another numerical evidence , discussed in sec .  [ bcrisis ] ) , but we want to recall that saddle - node bifurcations of @xmath32 tori have been reported @xcite ( called bubbles in this reference ) , and due to the special character of the @xmath31 tori that we have here ( with one oscillation that , in some sense , is orthogonal to the others and also almost conserved , cf .",
    "[ quasip ] ) , and given the numerical evidence reported here , we think that we have found a saddle - node bifurcation of @xmath31 tori .",
    "as the route studied in this work presents some similarities with the classical route to chaos for an isolated lorenz system , we are going to draw some useful analogies with that system , although it is warned that the analogy is not complete ( otherwise , we would not have a new route to chaos ) .",
    "as it can be found in textbooks  @xcite , the lorenz system exhibits several routes to chaos .",
    "the classical one is the route to chaos through a double homoclinic connection of the saddle point at the origin .",
    "fixing @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the double homoclinic orbit occurs at a particular value @xmath62 and @xmath63 : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 @xcite . ] .",
    "it has the shape of the butterfly ( taking into account how the unstable directions reenter the saddle point at the origin , being this dictated by the reflection symmetry of the system ) , and this gives birth @xcite to a chaotic set for @xmath67 ( a homoclinic explosion @xcite ) .",
    "the closure of this set is formed by the infinite number of unstable periodic orbits ( upos ) that can be classified according to their symbolic sequences of turns around the right ( @xmath68 ) and the left ( @xmath69 ) fixed points ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 )  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of these upos reflects the dramatic change undergone by the stable manifold of the fixed point that allows initial conditions at one side of the phase space jump to the other side ( before falling to one of the two symmetry related stable fixed points @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) , being these jumps impossible for @xmath72 . for a larger value of @xmath27 , @xmath73 ,",
    "the chaotic set becomes stable in a boundary crisis , that occurs precisely when the two shortest symmetry - related length-@xmath74 unstable periodic orbits ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) located at each lobe , and that at @xmath62 coincide with the two homoclinic orbits , shrink , such that the chaotic set has a tangency with these two orbits  @xcite . at this value of @xmath27",
    "there exists a double heteroclinic connection between the equilibrium at the origin and the mentioned length-@xmath74 upos . for @xmath75 these two orbits ( and their respective tubular stable manifolds ) form the basin boundaries between the chaotic attractor and the two stable asymmetric fixed points @xmath76 , and , consequently , the system exhibits multistability .",
    "these two fixed points loose their stability in a a subcritical hopf bifurcation , that occurs when the two mentioned length-@xmath74 orbits shrink to a point coinciding with @xmath77 .      in our system one can find a value of @xmath78 that defines a clearcut transition in the way in which transients approach the attractors ( that for @xmath79 are two @xmath32-tori ) .",
    "for @xmath80 the basin of attraction of each @xmath32 is quite simple . but below @xmath81 trajectories may tend asymptotically to one of the @xmath32 after visiting the neighborhood of the other torus .",
    "following the analogy with the lorenz system , we conjecture that precisely at @xmath82 a global bifurcation occurs , and past this value ( @xmath83 ) an infinite number of unstable objects are created . to check this we stabilized the symmetric prw ( an unstable fixed point in the poincar map ) by a newton - raphson method and observed the fate of the trajectories starting from ( approximately ) that solution . in fig .",
    "[ explosion ] the evolution of the trajectories for two values of @xmath27 above and below @xmath81 is shown . after approaching one the asymmetric prws (",
    "its location is marked with a bold dotted line ) the trajectory jumps or not to the other side .",
    "the result obtained for @xmath81 is the same if one takes as starting point one of the asymmetric prws .     at the poincare section for trajectories starting in an initial condition in the symmetric unstable prw : ( a ) for @xmath84 , a condition before the explosion ( b ) for @xmath85 just past the explosion .",
    "the @xmath86 coordinate of one of the two asymmetric prws is denoted with a bold dotted line . ]",
    "the third important numerical remark refers to the lyapunov spectrum ( table i ) of the different attractors in the multistability region ( of course , and due to symmetry , the lyapunov spectra of the two @xmath31 attractors are identical ) .",

    "thus , we postulate that the dynamics can be simplified to the study of a four - dimensional branched manifold .",
    "a theoretical justification of this statement is impossible , but one can argue along the lines of ( a higher - dimensional generalization of ) the birman - williams theorem @xcite ( this theorem has proven to be very useful , even if it requires the strange attractors to be ( uniformly ) hyperbolic what is usually not fulfilled ; notice , however , some recent rigorous advances @xcite on the theory of singular hyperbolic attractors , that encompass the lorenz equations @xcite .    in our case we can argue that the high - dimensional chaotic attractor has , according to kaplan - yorke conjecture @xcite , a value of the information dimension @xmath88 ( cf .  fig .",

    "the ` tear point ' is the symmetric prw .",

    "rotations around one of the lobes are roughly planar , but reinjections between the two ( planar ) lobes , that form themselves an angle , involve the third dimension .",
    "an important remark concerning this @xmath90-dimensional picture is that , in this space , a @xmath31-torus divides a @xmath90-dimensional manifold in two regions ( just the same as a cycle divides a surface ) .",

    "figure  [ 3dscheme ] represents a projection onto @xmath116 , hence some ( apparently ) forbidden intersections between trajectories appear because of the branching . as occurs with the lorenz attractor when it is projected on @xmath117 ( say @xmath118 ) , the intersections between trajectories coming from different lobes , and also of them with the @xmath119 axis ( that belongs to the stable manifold of the origin ) are unavoidable .",
    "recall that it is the moment of the jump when the extra dimension is needed , and this is provided by the definition of a branched manifold .        summing up our previous numerical findings",
    ", we have for descending values of @xmath27 : the centered prw ( a ) becomes unstable through a pitchfork bifurcation ( a@xmath120b ) and two symmetry - related prws appear ( b ) . at a supercritical hopf bifurcation ( b@xmath120c )",

    "when @xmath27 is slightly decreased the 2d - torus becomes focus - type ( d ) ; the leading lyapunov exponent becomes degenerate as may be seen in fig .",

    "hence the unstable manifold of the asymmetric prw forms a ` whirlpool ' @xcite when approaching the @xmath32 . at @xmath121 a double heteroclinic connection between the asymmetric prws and",

    "note that the plot shows that the unstable manifold of one of the asymmetric prws intersects the stable manifold of the symmetric prw which in principle violates the theorem of existence and uniqueness .",
    "this occurs , as we said above , because we are projecting the poincar section onto @xmath116 ( one could imagine this as our particular _ flatland_. twin secondary hopf bifurcations ( f@xmath120 g ) render unstable the 2d - tori and give rise to two stable @xmath31 ( g ) . when @xmath27 is further decreased the asymmetric prws are not connected by their unstable manifolds to the @xmath31 ( h ) , and the chaotic set becomes attracting .    a two - dimensional cut of the schematic shown in fig .",

    "[ 2dscheme](h ) corresponds to @xmath96 , whereas fig .  [ 2dscheme](i ) corresponds to @xmath122 .",
    "it is to be stressed that the existence of @xmath31 attractors is not a fundamental part of the transition to high - dimensional chaos .",
    "just focus type @xmath32 are needed such that the unstable manifolds of the asymmetric prws form whirlpools @xcite . in this way , regarding the chaotic attractor , no fundamental change occurred if the unstable @xmath31 shrank to collide with the stable @xmath32 in a subcritical neimark - sacker bifurcation .",

    "unstable ) periodic orbits ( 2d - tori in the full phase space ) . ]",
    "in this section we want to address some subtle aspects concerning the transition to chaos shown in this paper .",
    "the first point that must be noted is that fig .",
    "[ 3dscheme ] is representing a map ( instead of a continuous dynamical system ) because a poincar section of the fast dynamics involving the spatial mode is assumed .",
    "however the fast spatial frequency is somehow ` orthogonal ' along the transition and therefore phase space may be understood as a direct product of this frequency with the transition shown in fig .",
    "[ 3dscheme ] that can be assumed not to differ too much from a continuous system . the fast spatial rotating wave is approximately conserved along the transition ( cf .",
    "[ quasip ] ) , and the weak interaction of this frequency stems from the rotational symmetry of the system and manifests through an additional vanishing lyapunov exponent in the high - dimensional chaotic region .    let us consider further which is the meaning of the lyapunov spectrum of the chaotic region . according to the route described by figs .",
    "[ 3dscheme ] and [ 2dscheme ] an infinite number of unstable @xmath31 are created at the heteroclinic explosion ( recall that only the two simplest ones are shown ) .",
    "hence , we could expect to have a chaotic attractor with three vanishing lyapunov exponents .",
    "why only two are observed ?",
    "region crw in fig .",
    "[ lyap_tran ] ) .    one could be tempted to think that that due to the non - hyperbolicity of quasiperiodic behavior , a finite ratio of the 3d - tori set corresponds to locked tori ( probably with large denominators ) , contributing to shift the vanishing lyapunov exponents from zero .",
    "however we believe that the absence of a third vanishing lyapunov exponent is due to the following .",
    "it must be noted that the heteroclinic connection between the symmetric and the asymmetric prws is structurally unstable .",
    "nonetheless , we have numerically observed ( see fig .  [ explosion ] ) that the connection ( approximately ) persists . also , the axial symmetry of fig .  [ 3dscheme ] has not a theoretical justification . in our view",
    "the situation is similar to the study of codimension-@xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) bifurcations , where an increase of the highest order @xmath128 , of the terms constituting the normal form ( or @xmath105-jet ) or adding a non symmetric term , makes substructures in the bifurcation sets emanating from the codimension-@xmath126 point to appear .",
    "for example , the effect of including non - axisymmetric terms to the normal form of the saddle - node hopf ( codimension - two ) bifurcation has been studied by kirk  @xcite .    hence we expect that , a perturbation on the mechanism shown in fig .  [ 3dscheme ] will break the symmetry that allows such a `` simple '' picture .",
    "inspired on previous works  @xcite dealing with the effect of non - symmetric terms on codimension - two bifurcations , we postulate that homoclinic connections would replace heteroclinic connections .",
    "a double ( ` figure - eight ' ) homoclinic of the symmetric prw as well as homoclinic connections of the asymmetric prws would occur .",
    "symmetric and asymmetric prws are both saddle - foci so we computed their saddle indices finding that a ( shilnikov ) chaotic set should arise ( @xmath129 ) , @xmath130 ( as the symmetric prw ) , the saddle index is defined to be @xmath131 , and chaos will occur for @xmath132 .",
    "furthermore , no stable periodic orbits exist in the neighborhood of homoclinicity for @xmath133 @xcite . in our case , symmetric and asymmetric prws are both fixed points of the 8-dimensional map ( obtained via poincar section ) , and , thus",
    ", they can be stabilized through the use of a newton method . as the sectioning is done to eliminate the fast rotating wave , we are legitimate to consider a continuous 8-dimensional system .",
    "the eigenvalues of the fixed points ( prws in the full space ) satisfy : @xmath134 ( @xmath135 are the eigenvalues of the map ) .",
    "we take the leading eigenvalues to compute the saddle indices .",
    "thus for @xmath136 , we get a saddle index @xmath137 for the symmetric prw , and under time reversal @xmath138 for the asymmetric prw .",
    "these values of @xmath139 imply the emergence of a chaotic set and absence of stable periodic orbits close to the symmetric prw ; and one repeller ( due to time - reversal ) periodic orbit colliding with the asymmetric prw . ] .",
    "the existence of homoclinic chaos ( with the only novel feature of having a superimposed fast spatial wave ) could be considered as uninteresting and well known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "but it is to be emphasized that as the exact mechanism is very related to what shown in fig .",
    "[ 3dscheme ] , the first negative lyapunov exponent is very close to zero which makes the information dimension to be larger than four ( or larger than three if the spatial oscillation is considered extra and/or trivial ) .",
    "the next question is how the two simplest unstable 3d - tori appear if the route is not exactly as appears in fig .",
    "[ 3dscheme ] .",
    "a possibility is that they appear though a saddle - node bifurcation between two unstable 2-tori ( see footnote 6 for its plausible origin ) , but we have no way to find out this .",
    "it is well known , @xcite that global bifurcations and complex behavior have in many cases a local origin , namely a high codimension point .",
    "at which the loci of several bifurcations meet in parameter space .",
    "in particular , a gavrilov - guckenheimer ( or saddle node - hopf point ) yields , among other , quasiperiodic dynamics . the reflection symmetry of the model studied in this work would imply the possibility of a pitchfork - hopf interaction in this case .",
    "although the unfolding for this codimension-@xmath140 point has not been fully characterized , it could be a clear candidate as an organizing center of part of the complex behavior discussed in this work .",
    "however , the location of such hypothetical critical point is rendered more difficult by the fact that , due to the presence of a spatial frequency in all the relevant parameter region , the hypothetical pitchfork - hopf point would occur in a poincar cross section of the system , making all the analysis much more involved . in particular",
    ", we have tried this avenue of research without success , and , thus , we have not been able to find a coalescence of the loci of the pitchfork and hopf bifurcations .",
    "direct transitions from quasiperiodicity to chaos has been observed experimentally ( e.g. in @xcite ) . in the past",
    "this has been interpreted as an effect of noise or lack of good control of the system .",
    "our results indicate that high - dimensional chaos may be reached directly without the need of noise , but only thanks to a particular type of global bifurcation .    in this paper",
    "we have studied by numerical and theoretical arguments the transition to high - dimensional chaos , in a system of three coupled lorenz oscillators .",
    "the transition from a periodic rotating wave to a chaotic rotating wave has been investigated .",
    "the structure of the global bifurcations between cycles , underlying the creation of the chaotic set , is such that a chaotic attractor with dimension @xmath141 emerges .",
    "the transition is not mediated by low - dimensional chaos . also it must be noted that even if the fast rotating wave that is present all along the transition is omitted , we still have the creation of an attractor with dimension @xmath142 .",
    "as occurs with the lorenz system , the existence of reflection ( @xmath143 ) symmetry seems to play a fundamental role .",
    "the high - dimensionality of the chaotic attractor is not associated to hyperchaos .",
    "far from it , there is only one positive lyapunov exponents but high - dimensionality is possible due to the existence of two vanishing and one slightly negative les .",
    "hence , according to the kaplan - yorke conjecture the information dimension is above four .",
    "we have also measured the correlation dimension obtaining a value very close to four .",
    "the degeneracy of the null le make us think that a set of unstable tori is embedded in the attractor .",
    "we have focused on giving a geometric view of the bifurcations occurring in the 9-dimensional phase space of the system .",
    "although the precise sequence of bifurcations is probably resistant to analysis , we have been able to give a geometric view of the transitions that explains the emergence of the chaotic set , through a ` heteroclinic explosion ' , and its conversion in attractor .",
    "this step occurs through a boundary crisis when the chaotic attractor collides with its basin boundary formed by two unstable 3d - tori . in consequence a power law for the mean length of the chaotic transients",
