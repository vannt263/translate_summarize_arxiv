    "in recent years , many proposals are presented to protect quantum systems against decoherence . except the method to weaken the coupling between the system and its surroundings ,",

    "notice that the basis of the aforementioned dfs is time - independent , the dfs is then time - independent . for time - dependent lindblad operators , however ,",
    "a time - independent dfs may not exist , then a natural question arises : what is the dfs for open systems with time - dependent lindblad operators ? if the dfs is time - dependent , what is the condition for the system to remain in this subspace ?    in this paper , we will give a detail analysis for a time - dependent dfs ( t - dfs ) .",

    "the task to achieve an unitary evolution in the t - dfs relies entirely on the hamiltonian of the open system , @xmath93 in the next section , we will present two examples to show that the quantum state of the open system can be restricted to evolve unitarily in the t - dfs by manipulating the hamiltonian according to eq.([relation ] ) .",

    "in other words , the open system could evolve unitarily in the t - dfs by employing the scheme proposed in sec.[snc ] .",

    "this can be understood by examining eq.([relation ] ) : when the control fields are absent , the t - dfs condition is equivalent to that the right side of eq.([relation ] ) is zero , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
