    "for more than two decades , inflation  @xcite has been the only available paradigm to solve the standard cosmological problems of flatness , homogeneity , and monopole excess",
    ". it also predicts , as a bonus , that primordial fluctuations , assumed to be of quantum origin , could be enhanced to the level required to trigger large scale structure formation , with an almost scale - invariant spectrum . to date , no model has ever come close to challenging this impressive list of successes .",
    "inflation cosmology suffers , however , from a few problems of its own , whose seriousness is largely a matter of opinion .",
    "for instance , in a typical realization , the underlying parameters ( mass and coupling constants of the inflaton field ) must be assigned `` un - natural '' values in order to reproduce the observed temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) which the mechanism seeds .",
    "however , such a fine - tuning can be accounted for in various realistic models .",
    "the inflation paradigm is also endowed with two specific problems , conceptually much more serious , that may ultimately be related , namely the meaning of the trans - planckian  @xcite perturbations and the existence of a past singularity  @xcite . concerning the latter ,",
    "many ideas were discussed , among which the tolman phnix universe  @xcite , and many others in the seventies  @xcite , and recently revived under the name `` ekpyrotic ''  @xcite in the somewhat different context of superstring  @xcite inspired brane cosmology  @xcite .",
    "this model , however , was the subject of many criticisms , both from the string  @xcite and cosmological  @xcite points of view . in its latest version  @xcite , moreover , the model also contains a supposedly actual singularity  @xcite .",
    "quantum cosmology , in the framework of the wheeler - de - witt ( wdw ) equation , exhibits bouncing solutions  @xcite which can be interpreted as truly avoiding the singularity , even for flat ( @xmath1 ) spatial sections , a possibility strictly forbidden in classical general relativity ( gr ) , unless  @xcite some exotic material , with negative energy density violating the null energy condition ( nec )  @xcite , is introduced , which most cosmologists are reluctant on doing .",
    "such a bouncing universe model provides a solution to the horizon problem by geodesically completing the manifold in the past , and avoids the monopole formation if the bounce takes place at a temperature below that of grand unification ( gut ) ; this class of models does not however address the question of flatness and one must assume @xmath1 from the outset .",
    "moreover , in such a context , the trans - planckian issue simply does not exist because the initial conditions for the perturbations can be imposed during a phase where the universe is as close to the minkowski spacetime as one wishes , without ever passing through a planck phase .",
    "thus , it could be a natural competitor to the inflationary paradigm , and it is therefore of interest to estimate the primordial perturbation spectrum that it can produce .    in a previous work  @xcite , we examined the stability of a bouncing universe dominated , at the bounce , by an exotic hydrodynamical perfect fluid .",
    "we showed , by computing scalar perturbations using the gauge invariant bardeen  @xcite potential , that such perturbations grow unboundedly either at the bouncing point , or at the time when the nec was violated or restored , thereby contradicting the hypothesis of low amplitude first order perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "such models are thus incompatible with observational data , e.g. , cmbr data  @xcite according to which these first order effects indeed still dominate ( over nonlinear effects ) at large scales .    the next to simple possibility",
    "consists on using a scalar field instead of an exotic fluid .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to exhibit a toy model in which a radiation fluid is coupled to a negative energy free scalar field that is supposed to dominate the universe for a limited amount of time , during which the bounce occurs  @xcite .",
    "our universe thus comes from a low - density , radiation dominated , contracting state , passes through a bounce , and connects again back to the usual hot big - bang phase  @xcite .",
    "in this context , we shall be concerned with the scalar perturbations induced during the transition between the collapsing and expanding phases .    in section  [ sec : model ] we set the various constraints our model needs to satisfy , and we explain how it can be made phenomenologically reasonable .",
    "then we calculate , in section  [ sec : pert ] , the power spectrum of the perturbations by matching the relevant solutions in the various regions of interest , and we compare the results with numerical calculations .",
    "contrary to what one would naively expect from a fluid analysis  @xcite , we find that scalar perturbations are perfectly well behaved all along .    setting vacuum initial conditions for the quantized hydrodynamical perturbations deep in the low - density radiation dominated phase , we find that the relevant spectrum of perturbations , at last horizon crossing during the expanding radiation dominated era , has a spectral index @xmath0 .",
    "it is thus incompatible with observational data .",
    "as it is a model dependent result , further investigations of more realistic models  @xcite , from the point of view of particle physics , need to be done  @xcite .",
    "while other models yield a scale invariant spectrum by making use of various assumptions  @xcite , the present calculations are made with a specific model where the transition through the bounce is made with an exact solution .",
    "this allows one to obtain , qualitatively and numerically , the transitions in the bardeen potential and its derivative through the bounce , yielding indications on what kind of matching conditions  @xcite should be proposed for perturbations passing through a general bounce .",
    "we obtain the perhaps not so surprising result that the bardeen potential changes sign through the bounce , even though its derivative is continuous , contrary to the case of a sharp transition  @xcite .",
    "this result will be discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , in which we present a way to obtain a scale invariant spectrum for the scalar perturbation by connecting our bounce and radiation dominated model with a slowly contracting phase .",
    "if such a four - dimensional and singularity - free model can be constructed , it will be able to reproduce all the available observational data while avoiding most of the questions raised by the inflation solution .",
    "this paper only deals with the scalar part of the perturbations , which we show does not yield a spectrum compatible with the data .",
    "the tensor part was already calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the spectral index @xmath2 was obtained , and is therefore unable to reproduce the data .",
    "finally , we will not be concerned with vectorial ( rotational ) perturbations even though , contrary to the usual inflationary case , one could think that those have no reason to be _ a priori _ negligible with a time symmetric scale factor . however , the universe is torque - free  @xcite since at least the nucleosynthesis epoch that occurred at a redshift of @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the present relative contribution @xmath4 for the vectorial perturbation , which scales as @xmath5  @xcite , is expected to be @xmath6 , independent of the scale @xmath7 at which it is evaluated , and hence observationally irrelevant .",
    "we shall consider a very simple toy model for which we demand the following conditions to hold .",
    "first of all , we want general relativity to be valid for all times .",
    "we also impose that at late times , the model should reproduce the standard hot big bang case , i.e. there should exist a time in which radiation dominates .",
    "this implies in particular that we assume some amount of radiation to be present in our model .",
    "we also restrict our attention to the spatially flat situation .",
    "finally , the model should have a bouncing phase .",
    "this means , given that there is already some radiation present , that , in the context of gr , there must exist some other fluid having negative energy . in particular , for the special case at hand",
    "for which the spatial curvature @xmath1 , this means that the null energy condition ( nec ) must be violated at some time near the bounce  @xcite .",
    "realizing such a model is in principle feasible with just another fluid , e.g. , some stiff matter with negative energy , namely one for which the equation of state reads @xmath8 .",
    "however , it was recently shown  @xcite that such an approach will lead to an overproduction of large inhomogeneities at various different times , breaking the cosmological principle hypothesis long before nucleosynthesis .",
    "such an approach is therefore not applicable , and we must resort to the next - to - simple possibility , namely a free massless scalar field which is known to reproduce the stiff matter fluid behavior at the background level  @xcite .",
    "the action we shall start with thus reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the curvature scalar , @xmath11 the energy density of the radiation fluid , and @xmath12 the scalar field .",
    "we assume that the background metric takes the standard friedmann - robertson - walker form @xmath13    with @xmath14 the conformal time .",
    "the cosmic time , @xmath15 , is then obtained as the solution of the equation @xmath16 once the scale factor @xmath17 is known",
    ". note that throughout this paper , we assume the background curvature to vanish , @xmath1 . in this context",
    ", it has to be a particular choice : this category of models does not indeed solve the flatness problem .    varying the action  ( [ action ] ) with respect to the fluid and fields yields the background dynamical equations @xmath18    where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the background space - independent values of the radiation energy density @xmath11 and scalar field @xmath12 respectively , and a prime denotes a differentiation with respect to the conformal time @xmath14 .",
    "these background equations imply @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constant .",
    "the energy density of the scalar field is given by @xmath25 and as such it is dominant when @xmath26 is small and negligible when @xmath26 is very large .",
    "these solutions , together with friedmann equation @xmath27 lead to the bouncing solution @xmath28    where the minimum scale factor @xmath29 and the characteristic bouncing conformal time @xmath30 solely depend on the relative quantities of energy density in radiation and scalar field at some given time : @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in",
    "what follows , these two parameters will be considered as the relevant ones .    before turning to first order perturbations of this background , which is the subject of the following section , we want to emphasize a point of stability of this model related to the `` wrong '' sign chosen in eq .",

    "( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath33    with @xmath34 $ ] the classical part and @xmath35 interpreted respectively as gravitons and scalar particles in a semi - classical approach , will inevitably lead to two different kinds of instabilities , each arising at a different order in perturbation .",
    "the first one , with which we shall deal later since it is actually the one responsible for the large scale structure formation in this model , is second order in perturbation ( first order in the equations of motion ) and goes essentially as @xmath36 .",
    "this term is absent in ordinary minkowski space , but is present in the cosmological setup we are considering because of eq .",

    "[ feynman]@xmath41 .",
    "the presence of such a process means that the vacuum can spontaneously decay into a pair of negative energy scalar particles and a graviton , and , due to this fact , the energy levels are not bounded from below .",
    "this sounds like a catastrophe , and even more so because the only available timescale comes from the coupling constant , i.e. , the planck time .",
    "however , it is clear from the figure that the process probability amplitude @xmath42 is @xmath43 , with @xmath44gev the planck mass and @xmath45 the momentum at the vertex .",
    "such an amplitude therefore becomes important when the characteristic scale @xmath46 is comparable to @xmath47 . at this point , it should be argued that the model of eq .",

    ", one can safely ignore this instability and concentrate on the production of cosmological perturbations .",

    "the fact that the bardeen potential only connects to the odd bounce function @xmath201 suggests that in the limit in which the bounce duration @xmath30 can be neglected , one may apply the following junction conditions across the surface at which the bounce is located ( @xmath202 ) @xmath203_\\pm = \\left [ \\phi'+{{\\cal h}}\\phi \\right]_\\pm = 0,\\label{junc}\\ ] ] where @xmath204_\\pm = a(-{\\eta_{_{\\rm b}}})-a(+{\\eta_{_{\\rm b}}})$ ] is the jump in the geometric quantity @xmath58 . on fig .",

    "( [ junc ] ) . for a fixed surface thickness @xmath205 , and in a way independent of this thickness ,",
    "the relevant quantities are indeed conserved and can be safely used .",
    "this is of course true only in the particular example presented here , but it can also be conjectured to apply for a symmetric bounce in general .",

    "( top ) and @xmath206 , ( bottom ) as a function of @xmath207 for @xmath200.,width=321 ]",
    "we have presented a cosmological model in which a bounce takes place in the framework of pure general relativity .",
    "this is achieved by assuming that , at some stage after a contracting phase , a negative energy free scalar field became important . performing a bounce with such a scalar field , instead of an ordinary hydrodynamical fluid ,",
    "permits to regularize the perturbation , which otherwise grow unbounded near the bounce  @xcite .",
    "we derived the last horizon crossing spectrum and obtained , both analytically and numerically , a spectral index @xmath0 in the long wavelength limit , therefore ruling out such a model as a competitor to the inflationary paradigm .",
    "however , our study of a concrete bouncing model allowed us to obtain some intuition on what happens with perturbations when they pass through a bounce .",
    "first of all , the bounce acts indeed as a `` pump field '' for perturbations .",
    "secondly , the field which produces the bounce in the background solution , and its perturbations , is not relevant for the evolution of the bardeen potential in almost the whole history of the model , except near the bounce itself , where it becomes very important for the power spectrum amplitude , although not for the spectral index .",
    "finally , usual matching conditions are not valid for transitions through a bounce .",
    "in fact , even for the background metric , such conditions are not valid since the hubble parameter @xmath208 changes sign through the bounce , by definition . through our bounce",
    ", the bardeen potential also changes sign , and what happens to be continuous is the combination @xmath209 .",
    "inspired by our concrete model , we suggested matching conditions to be applied to general models where the bounce is not specified , which are spelled out in the subsection [ sub : num ] .",
    "of course , these suggestions must be checked within other concrete examples , or through a more general formal analysis .",
    "the model we have discussed is admittedly over simplistic .",
    "we may be confident in its latest part describing the radiation dominated epoch , which we know have taken place in our universe , and accept that it may provide a reasonable description of an immediately preceding bouncing phase .",
    "there is , however , no reason to believe , even in the case of a bounce , that the evolution of the universe should have been symmetric in time .",
    "one can instead set up a contracting phase with a different scale factor , assuming at some stage some form of entropy production , to end up with enough radiation before the bounce , yielding a scale factor of the form  ( [ scale ] ) that ultimately connects back to standard cosmology .",
    "such a model should originate in a realistic underlying particle physics theory .",
    "let us briefly discuss an example , which is reminiscent of the ekpyrotic proposal  @xcite , with a few differences .",
    "first , the model we have in mind would be purely four dimensional and does not intend to address the flatness problem .",
    "second , such a model would be effectively singularity free .",
    "finally , we would not need to impose arbitrary  @xcite matching conditions across the bounce to obtain the required mixing in the growing and decaying modes before and after the bounce , since its specific form would be known .",
    "more precisely , a model satisfying the abovementioned requirements could consist in a bouncing model having a slowly contracting phase , @xmath210 , with @xmath211 , connected to the phase examined in the previous sections , as the one shown on fig .  [",
    "fig : abounce ] . when the perturbation in the bardeen potential crosses the horizon for the first time , the dependence @xmath212 in eq .",
    "( [ phii ] ) , stemming from the fact that the universe is supposed to be radiation dominated at that time , would be substituted by a dependence @xmath213 , i.e. , almost independent of @xmath7 when @xmath214 . doing calculations along the lines of those presented in sec .",
