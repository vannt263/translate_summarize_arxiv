    "the volume growth of the euclidean regular @xmath0-simplex inscribed in the unit sphere can be calculated by the volume form @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 means the @xmath0-dimensional volume of the simplex , the @xmath1-dimensional volume of its facet @xmath7 and the height of the simplex , respectively .",
    "thus we have @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath9 is the radius of the circumscribed sphere of the regular simplex @xmath10 then by similarity the ratio @xmath11 is equal to @xmath12 . in summary ,",
    "the euclidean `` volume growth '' is not an interesting quantity , it can be determined exactly and easily .",
    "in contrast to the euclidean case in hyperbolic @xmath0-space there is at least one kind of regular simplices which volume growth is very important .",
    "this is the regular , ideal simplex . in hyperbolic @xmath0-space",
    "a simplex is called _ regular _ if any permutation of its vertices can be induced by an isometry of the space . a simplex _ ideal _ if all the vertices are on the sphere at infinity .",
    "there is only , up to isometry , only one ideal regular simplex in hyperbolic @xmath0-space .",
    "it is known that the volume of a hyperbolic simplex is finite also if some of the vertices are on the sphere at infinity .",
    "contrary the case of the plane , there is non - congruent ideal simplices arising an interesting question : which one has maximal volume ?",
    "the answer that _ a simplex is of maximal volume if and only if it is ideal and regular _ was conjectured ( for any @xmath0 ) by thurston in @xcite . in three space",
    "it was proved by milnor ( see in @xcite or @xcite ) . in higher dimension spaces",
    "this result was published by u. haagerup and h. munkholm in @xcite .",
    "their prove based on the `` volume growth '' of an ideal , regular simplex , proposition 2 in @xcite says that @xmath13 .",
    "these bounds relies on an interplay between the volume forms of the poincare s half - space model and the volume form of the cayley - klein s projective model using also gauss divergence formula .",
    "unfortunately , in hyperbolic @xmath0-space there is no formula analogous to ( [ euclideangrowth ] ) , hence to compare the @xmath0-volume of a regular simplex and the @xmath1-volume of its facets is a non - trivial exercise .    in recent decades the analytic investigations in hyperbolic space and even more the examination of computational methods of the @xmath0-dimensional hyperbolic volume appreciated . without mentioning the exhaustive list",

    "we give estimates for the volume growth of a regular hyperbolic simplex in the above detailed sense . in additions",

    "our upper bound gives the best known upper bound proved by haagerup and munkholm in 1981 . on the other hand ,",
