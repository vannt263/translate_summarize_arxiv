    "in engineering mechanics , _ damage _ is understood as a load - induced evolution of microstructural defects , resulting in a reduced macroscopic material integrity .",
    "the phenomenological constitutive models of damage incorporate the irreversible phenomena by reducing the secant modulus of elasticity depending on the _ internal _ damage variable .",
    "since the seminal contribution of  @xcite , it has been well - understood that such description within the framework of local ( i.e. scale - free ) continuum mechanics leads to an ill - posed problem , resulting in localization of damage growth into an arbitrarily small region . as a remedy to this pathology",
    ", a plethora of non - local rate - independent continuum theories , based on integral , explicit and implicit gradient approaches , has been proposed to introduce an _ internal length scale _ into the description , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  26 ) for a representative overview .    despite a significant increase in objectivity offered by the enhanced continuum theories , the non - local damage formulations often suffer from the fact that the non - local variables are introduced into the model in an ad - hoc fashion , thus violating basic constraints of thermodynamics .",
    "in addition , due to violation of the principle of local action , such inconsistencies are rather difficult to detect , especially in the multi - dimensional setting , e.g.  @xcite . fortunately , as first demonstrated by  @xcite and later confirmed by a number of independent studies , e.g.  @xcite , a simple one - dimensional study of the localization behavior can serve as a convenient `` filter '' test , allowing to pinpoint various inconsistencies in the constitutive model formulation .",
    "motivation of the present work arose from an energetic non - local damage model proposed by  @xcite , which combines the basic features of an engineering damage model due to  @xcite with recent advances in the mathematical theory of rate - independent irreversible processes  @xcite .",
    "such a connection provides a powerful modeling and analysis framework , allowing at the same time a rigorous mathematical treatment of the complete damage  @xcite , theoretically supported numerical implementation  @xcite as well as a thermodynamically consistent variational formulation of the non - local damage evolution problem . in this contribution",
    ", a localization study of the model will be performed to examine its qualitative behavior from the engineering viewpoint .",
    "numerical as well as analytical results are provided to illustrate its basic features with emphasis on the proper representation of the damage process from its initiation until complete failure .",
    "let us consider a prismatic bar of length @xmath0 , subjected to displacement - controlled uniaxial tensile loading . in the sequel",
    ", the bar will be represented by the interval @xmath1 , with boundary @xmath2 ( consisting of two points ) subjected to the dirichlet loading @xmath3  ( see ) , where @xmath4 denotes the ( pseudo- ) time taken from interval @xmath5 .        following the standard thermodynamic approach to constitutive modeling , cf .",
    "* chapter  25 ) , a state of the system is described using an admissible displacement and damages fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "formally , we write @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the set of kinematically admissible displacements , @xmath10 stands for the set of admissible damage values , and @xmath11 is the sobolev space of functions with square - integrable weak derivatives , e.g.  @xcite , often denoted as @xmath12 .    within the adopted _ global _ energetic framework  @xcite ,",
    "the constitutive description of the damage model is provided by the _ globally stored energy _ functional @xmath13 and by the _ global dissipation distance _",
    "@xmath14 physically , @xmath15 represents the energy reversibly stored in the system , and @xmath16 is the energy dissipated by changing the damage field from @xmath17 to @xmath18 . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ge ] ) and  ( [ eq : gdd ] ) , @xmath19  [ pa ] denotes the young modulus of the material , @xmath20  [ jm@xmath21 is the amount of energy needed to disintegrate a unit volume of the material , and @xmath22  [ m ] is a characteristic length of the model .",
    "later it will become clear that the `` @xmath23 '' term appearing in   ensures the irreversibility of the damage evolution ; i.e. at any point , the damage variable can not decrease in time .",
    "now , given the dirichlet loading @xmath3 , energetic functionals @xmath15 and @xmath16 and initial data @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the _ energetic solution _ of the damage problem is provided by functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfying  @xcite :    global stability : :    for all @xmath28 $ ] , @xmath29    and @xmath30 @xmath31 energy equality : :    for all @xmath28 $ ] @xmath32 where @xmath33    denotes the power of external loading .",
    "although the previous two conditions present the formal definition of the energetic solution , the analysis itself will be performed using the time discretization technique , see e.g.  @xcite for a nice exposition . to that end",
    ", we introduce a uniform partitioning of the time interval @xmath34 and inductively solve the minimization problem @xmath35 \\hskip 5 mm \\mbox{for } k = 1 , 2 , \\ldots , n\\ ] ] note that the previous problem is independent from @xmath36 , which is consistent with the assumed rate - independent character of the damage process .",
    "the theoretical results gathered in  @xcite show that , under reasonable data qualification , the solution of the time - discretized problem converge to the energetic solution as @xmath37 .",
    "having established the essentials of the global energetic framework , we will now proceed with the main goal of this contribution  the analysis of the simple uniaxial tensile test .",
    "intuitively , we expect that as long as the energy density at all points of the structure stays below @xmath20 , the response of the bar remains elastic and no damage evolution occurs within the structure .",
    "after the energy density reaches the value of @xmath20 at a certain time @xmath38 , damage is initiated and localization occurs .",
    "therefore , the explicit description of the localization phenomenon will build on the incremental variational principle  ( [ eq : incr_min ] ) .",
    "note that , for the sake of brevity , the time instant @xmath38 and the time increment @xmath39 will be omitted in the rest of this paper .",

    "( [ eq : el2 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : el3 ] )  and  ( [ eq : el4 ] ) provide the link between strain and damage and describe the elastic , damaging and fully damaged part of the structure , respectively .",
    "note that by virtue of  , the stress @xmath48 remains to be well - defined even in the fully damaged region , where the physical meaning of displacements @xmath49 and strains @xmath50 is rather questionable .",
    "this open the way to the rigorous mathematical treatment of the complete damage problem , see  @xcite for further discussion .",
    "concentrating on the damaging zone only , we divide by @xmath20 and , employing identity  ( [ eq : sigma_def ] ) , rewrite it in the form of a non - linear ordinary differential equation @xmath51 where @xmath52 parameterizes the softening process and ranges from @xmath53 at the onset of localization to @xmath54 at the stress - free state of complete failure .",
    "it is also useful to rewrite in the rate form @xmath55 which is an ordinary second - order differential equation for the damage rate @xmath56 with possibly non - constant coefficients .",
    "note that damage irreversibility requires @xmath57 .",
    "observe that at the onset of damage , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , simplifies to @xmath60 leading to the general solution @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 denoting the integration constants , the latter specifying the position of the center of the localized profile . assuming that this zone corresponds to an interval @xmath64 located sufficiently far from the boundary , the damage rate has to verify four independent conditions @xmath65 yielding @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the width of the localized zone , cf .",
    "a. the rate of the damage variable at the onset of damage is therefore given by @xmath68 the previous expression is consistent with the constraint @xmath69 since the stress rate @xmath70 is negative in the softening regime , which implies @xmath71 .",
