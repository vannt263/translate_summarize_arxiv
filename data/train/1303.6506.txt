    "( fof ) algorithm , with linking length fixed to 0.17 times the mean inter - particle separation .",
    "the lagrangian regions around @xmath27 from the centre of the 24 most massive objects ( all with @xmath28 m@xmath29 ) were identified , traced back to their initial positions and then re - simulated at higher resolution using the zoomed initial conditions technique @xcite .",
    "these re - simulations were run adding the hydrodynamical part by turning on the _ smoothed particles hydrodynamics _ ( sph ) code implemented in gadget-2 .",
    "this was done assuming @xmath30 , with mass resolutions of @xmath31@xmath25m@xmath29  and @xmath32@xmath25m@xmath29  for the dm and gas particles , respectively , and with a plummer - equivalent softening length for the gravitational force fixed to @xmath33 kpc in physical units at @xmath34 and kept fixed in comoving units at earlier times .    in order to add statistics at the lower mass scales , another set of 5 galaxy clusters with masses @xmath35@xmath25m@xmath29",
    "was selected at @xmath26 and re - simulated with the same method , reaching a total of 29 re - simulated regions .",
    "the set of 29 re - simulations was run with three different physical implementations .",
    "more detailed descriptions of these physical models can be found in @xcite .    * _ nr _ : non - radiative runs .",
    "they do not include any physical process except gravitation and hydrodynamics .",
    "although unrealistic , they are useful as a test to check the impact of the various physical mechanisms . * _ csf _ : runs including cooling , star formation , metal enrichment and galactic winds . the radiative cooling rates are computed following the procedure of @xcite , considering also the contribution of metals in the hypothesis of a gas in ( photo-)ionisation equilibrium by using the cloudy code @xcite .",
    "star formation is followed according to the multi - phase model of @xcite which also includes energy release by supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "other feedback sources include heating from a spatially uniform , time dependent uv background @xcite and metals released by type - ii and type - ia sne and agb stars according to the model of @xcite .",
    "finally , a kinetic feedback associated to galactic ejecta is implemented assuming a mass upload proportional to the star formation rate and a wind speed of @xmath36 km s@xmath22 . *",

    "the amount of kinetic energy released by each bh particle is given by @xmath38 being @xmath39 and @xmath40 the radiative efficiency and the fraction of energy coupled to the gas , respectively . in our implementation",
    "these two free parameters were fixed at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , increasing to @xmath43 when the accretion rate is smaller than one - hundredth of the eddington limit ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we will take this model as our reference one .",
    "since the volume of each of the 29 re - simulations encloses a spherical region of radius much larger than the virial radius of the main object , it is common to find other haloes included in the final @xmath26 outputs .",
    "hence , in order to increase the statistical significance of our results and to characterize better also the low mass objects , we included in our sample all the ` secondary ' haloes with @xmath44@xmath25m@xmath29   in _ at least _",
    "one of the three runs .",
    "the values of @xmath45 were computed starting from the fof catalogues and applying a _ spherical overdensity _ algorithm .",
    "this increases our halo sample to a total of 62 objects in different mass ranges .",
    "a histogram of their masses is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] .        in order to study the dependence of the clumpiness on the mass of the halo and on its dynamical properties",
    ", we divide our objects into subsamples : given the amplitude of our initial sample , this can be done without losing statistical robustness . in particular we will adopt the following two definitions :    * _ clusters_/_groups _ ( 28 and 34 objects , respectively ) , according to their @xmath45 being higher / lower than @xmath46@xmath25m@xmath29 , * _ relaxed_/_perturbed _ ( 30 and 32 objects , respectively ) , according to a definition based on the clumpiness and described in section  [ ssec : crho_samp ] .    the histogram of fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] shows also these classifications .",
    "it is worth to mention that clusters tend to be slightly more perturbed ( 16 and 12 relaxed ) than groups ( 16 and 18 ) due to their more active dynamical state .",
    "a commonly used indicator of the degree of inhomogeneity of a medium is its clumpiness . even if it is normally used to measure the amount of small clumps in an approximately uniform medium , its general definition allows us to use it also to quantify the amount of inhomogeneity associated to large - scale density fluctuations .",
    "the clumpiness or clumping factor @xmath47  of a fluid element is defined by the following formula : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the fluid density and the brackets @xmath50 indicate the average calculated over its volume .",
    "the clumpiness is therefore defined as being equal to unity for a perfectly uniform medium and @xmath51 otherwise , with higher values indicating higher levels of inhomogeneities . when writing explicitly the integrals , eq .",
    "( [ eq : clp0 ] ) can be expressed as as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the mass and volume of the gas element , respectively .",
    "since we are using sph simulations , for a given distance @xmath55 from the cluster centre , we compute @xmath56 by converting eq .",
    "( [ eq : clp1 ] ) into @xmath57 where the sum @xmath58 is computed over the particles with distance between @xmath55 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the mass and density , respectively , of the @xmath62-th sph particle and @xmath63 $ ] is the volume of the shell used to compute the quantity .    for the purpose of our work ,",
    "for every halo we compute the clumpiness and the other physical quantities in the range @xmath64 , in 50 equally spaced bins .",
    "the amount of clumpiness of the icm is caused by two different phenomena : the presence of small dense clumps and the density fluctuations on larger scales associated to asymmetries in the large - scale accretion pattern , with the first one that constitutes the dominating contribution .",
    "here we describe a method that proves useful to isolate these two components in order to treat them separately .",
    "this aspect is particularly important when we consider that the physical properties of clumps and their abundance depend on the processes of cooling and star formation and , consequently , their presence in our simulated clusters is subject to the uncertainties associated to the implementation of physical models in hydrodynamical codes .",
    "moreover , several works ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) highlighted how sph simulations produce a higher quantity of dense clumps with respect to eulerian ones .",
    "this is associated to the different numerical viscosity , intrinsic in the codes themselves , that causes a lower dissipation efficiency in sph simulations .    to this purpose",
    ", we follow the volume - selection scheme described in @xcite to compute the profiles of galaxy clusters close to and beyond @xmath2 .",
    "this method consists in sorting the sph particles belonging to a given radial bin according to their physical density .",
    "then , starting from the most diffuse one , we sum up their volumes ( defined as @xmath65 ) until we reach a fixed fraction , 99 per cent in our case , of the total volume of the radial bin and consider only these particles to compute @xmath47 : the remaining particles are identified as clumps and considered separately in our computation .",
    "this procedure proved to be effective in excising all the dense and cold clumps that are highly dependent on the physical assumptions , as well as the small x - ray bright regions that are usually masked out in observational analyses , thus providing a good description of the global properties of the icm such as density , temperature and x - ray surface brightness ( see the discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recently , a similar approach has also been applied to eulerian simulations by @xcite who approximate the density distribution of the gas in different radial bins with a lognormal distribution and mark as clumps the cells with density above values fixed in terms of the @xmath66 of the distribution ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , although applied in completely different numerical simulations ( grid - based and sph ) , the two methods are formally identical , with their threshold of @xmath67 that matches our 99 per cent criterion . for what concerns the possible biases caused by unresolved clumpy gas",
    ", we have verified that they have a small impact on our results . for more details about this point and about the clumps physical properties , we refer to the appendix  [ app : clumps_obs ] .",
    "we use this method to define the _ residual clumpiness _ associated to large - scale perturbations , @xmath0 , and to separate it from the total one : this allows us to note that the value of @xmath0  is about one order of magnitude lower with respect to @xmath47  inside @xmath2  ( see the discussion in section  [ ssec : crho_samp ] ) .",
    "we have also checked that in most of the cases lowering the threshold value to 95 per cent ( i.e. increasing by a factor of 5 the volume of gas considered as small - scale clumps ) produces negligible changes in @xmath0 . however , when the cluster is perturbed by the presence of a large halo ( e.g. an infalling group ) , lowering the density threshold for the clumps identification can change the final result by up to 50 per cent in the radial bins corresponding to the halo distance .",
    "a sketch of the application of this method is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] for two different cases .",
    "these x - ray surface brightness maps show that when cutting the 1 per cent densest volume ( from top to middle panels ) we are able to remove all obvious clumpy structures that are associated to the brightest peaks .",
    "when cutting the 5 per cent of the volume ( bottom panels ) the surface brightness remains almost unchanged for a relaxed halo ( left ) while for a dynamically perturbed one ( right ) the infalling halo on the bottom right is progressively removed , indicating that it is difficult to define a precise threshold to separate the two components .",
    "the effect on the definition of @xmath0  can be clearly seen in the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : clp_99_95 ] , where we show the residual clumpiness as a function of radius computed for these two haloes by adopting the two different volume threshold : while for d17-_a _ the value of @xmath0  is almost independent on the threshold chosen up to @xmath2 , for d12-_a _ the presence of the infalling halo at @xmath68@xmath2   produces a difference of about 0.25 .    for this reason we use the difference between the value of @xmath0  computed with these two limits to introduce another useful halo classification .",
    "we sort our haloes according to the maximum relative difference between @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 and split our 62 haloes roughly into two equal subsamples : we define a halo as _ relaxed _ when this difference is less than 8 per cent , and _ perturbed _ otherwise . in this way , we end up with 32 perturbed haloes and 30 relaxed ones . for this last set",
    "we can consider our value of @xmath0  to represent a robust estimate of the amount of inhomogeneities associated to large - scale asymmetries .",
    "we also verified that our classification has a good correspondence with an observational - like classification based on x - ray images .",

    "d17-a ( black lines , lower values ) and d12-_a _ ( red lines , higher values ) .",
    "the value of @xmath0  has been computed adopting two different thresholds for the volume - clipping method : 99 per cent ( solid lines ) and 95 per cent ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the physical model assumed is the reference one ( _ agn _ ) .",

    "[ fig : clp_phys ] the results of the clumpiness as a function of radius for our whole sample of objects , computed considering the three physical implementations described in section  [ ssec : feedback ] .",
    "when radiative cooling is included ( _ csf _  and _ agn _  models ) the level of clumpiness is very high and ranges from @xmath72 close to the centre up to @xmath73 close to @xmath2 .",
    "when extending to outer regions the value of @xmath47  increases exponentially reaching values of the order of 100 at @xmath74 , with no significant difference when including bh feedback . when neglecting gas cooling ( _ nr _ ) , the values drop down by a factor of 510 over the whole range , indicating that the value of @xmath47  is mainly associated to small cold clumps .",
    "however , when comparing our results with observational estimates one must consider that the cold dense gas at @xmath75 k does not produce any observable clumpiness in x - ray images .",
    "this makes the plotted _ nr _  profile model a reference for the observed value of @xmath47  without considering any detection of emitting clumps .",
    "for this reason we conclude that the value of @xmath316 obtained by @xcite for the perseus cluster is not realistic , since it is sufficient to exclude cold gas from our simulations to obtain significantly lower values .    the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : clp_phys ] shows the values of @xmath0 , which corresponds to the value of the clumpiness computed after applying the 1 per cent volume - clipping described in section  [ ssec : volume ] . with this method",
    "the difference associated to the physical implementations disappears almost completely , even for the _ nr _  model : this indicates that large - scale inhomogeneities do not depend on the physical process that occur in the icm , but on the intrinsic dynamical properties of the halo itself . in this case",
    "the median of @xmath0  computed on the whole sample has a value very close to 1 ( e.g. almost uniform medium ) close to the centre and grows constantly up to 1.31.4 at @xmath2 .",
    "there is a significant variance between the different haloes with about 25 per cent of objects having values of @xmath76 .",
    "outside @xmath2  the value of @xmath0  reaches @xmath77 at 2@xmath2 , together with an increase of the dispersion between the objects : this reflects the intrinsic difference between the environment of the clusters and groups outskirts that can contain or not infalling haloes and accreting filaments .",
    "this independence with respect to the physical implementation is partially in contrast with what obtained by @xcite that observe a slightly higher degree of inhomogeneity of the bulk in their nr runs , of the order of @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , also in our simulations we see a small ( @xmath79 ) systematic excess in our _ nr _  model , associated to the hot - dense tail of the icm distribution .",
    "this discrepancy probably indicates a different cooling efficiency in the simulations analysed here and by @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see how the trend of @xmath0  varies when considering the mass of the halo and its dynamic status .",
    "we show in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : clp_samp ] the results of @xmath0  computed when separating the haloes according to their mass into groups and clusters ( see section  [ ssec : sample ] ) .",
    "clusters have on average a higher value of @xmath0 of the order of @xmath80 , with larger differences outside @xmath2 : this is due to the fact that massive objects have higher probability of accreting material even at later epochs , while galaxy groups are dynamically older , more dynamically stable and , therefore , more uniform . when separating relaxed and perturbed objects according to our definition ( see section  [ ssec : volume ] ) the difference is even more remarkable , as it can be seen in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : clp_samp ] . while close to the centre the two samples have very similar values of @xmath0 , the presence of accreting structures pushes the residual clumpiness of perturbed objects beyond 1.5 at @xmath2 . on the other side ,",
    "relaxed haloes show all the same trend with @xmath0  raising linearly to 1.31.5 at @xmath2 : the residual clumpiness of these objects should be considered as an indicator of the amount of inhomogeneities common to all haloes , even the more dynamically stable , and connected to their departure from spherical symmetry and to the density fluctuations associated to the large - scale accretion patterns .",
    "we observe as well that the differences in @xmath0  associated to the clusters / groups classification can be explained completely by the different correlation with the relaxed / perturbed one , ( i.  e. clusters have higher values of @xmath0  because they are on average more perturbed than groups ) , making the latter classification the more interesting for our purposes .",
    "we note also that the trends that we observe are similar to those found by @xcite , ( we refer to their bulk csf results ) , both in terms of radial dependence and with respect to the dynamical state of the haloes .",
    "as said , the clumpiness of the icm is not a directly measurable quantity . here",
    "we investigate the possibility of obtaining an estimate from the observed azimuthal scatter of the x - ray and sz profiles of the haloes .",
    "following @xcite , we define the azimuthal scatter of an observable quantity @xmath81 as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the number of azimuthal sectors , @xmath84 is the radial profile of the quantity in a given sector and @xmath85 is the average over the @xmath83 sectors at distance @xmath55 from the centre . in our case",

    "in this paper we have analyzed a set of 62 simulated clusters and groups , obtained with different physical prescriptions , with the objective of providing a global characterization of their density inhomogeneities in the regions close to the virial radius .",
    "we have described a method that allows to separate the icm clumpiness associated to small clumps from a `` residual '' one that corresponds to large - scale inhomogeneities , and discussed how the latter depends on the mass and the dynamical state of the halo .",
    "finally , we have discussed how the presence of large - scale inhomogeneities can bias the estimates of @xmath1 , @xmath4  and @xmath5  and provided a method to reduce this bias by using a directly observable quantity : the azimuthal scatter in the x - ray surface brightness profiles or in the thermal sz ones ( @xmath6-parameter  profiles ) .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .    * as expected , the degree of global clumpiness in our simulated objects depends mainly on the presence / absence of radiative cooling , making about one order of magnitude difference . once cooling",
    "is included , additional feedback mechanisms do not change significantly the clumping factor . *",
    "when considering only the contribution of emitting gas , we obtain values of @xmath47@xmath125 at @xmath2 . when compared to the value of @xmath126 claimed by @xcite",
    ", we conclude that their estimate can not be reproduced by our models , even neglecting the possibility of identifying emitting clumpy structures . *",
    "we introduce the concept of _ residual clumpiness _ , @xmath0 , to quantify the amount of large - scale inhomogeneities ( departure from spherical symmetry , presence of filaments ) , that corresponds to the bulk clumpiness once obvious bright condensed clumps are masked out .",
    "this quantity is independent of the physical model assumed , while it is sensitive to the dynamical state of the halo : relaxed objects have @xmath0@xmath127 at @xmath2 , while dynamically perturbed ones have on average @xmath0@xmath128 . *",
    "the residual clumpiness of the icm causes a significant overestimate in the measurement of @xmath1  from x - ray observations of the order of @xmath129 per cent for the more relaxed objects up to @xmath130 per cent for the more perturbed ones . *",
    "a smaller negative bias of about 2 per cent is present also in the measurement of @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , the combination of the two biases results in an overestimate of @xmath5 , with average values of @xmath131 per cent , and an intrinsic scatter of @xmath132 per cent ( interquartile range ) .",
    "these biases are lower when compared to other known systematics .",
    "* the residual clumpiness correlates well ( @xmath133 ) with the azimuthal scatter of the x - ray surface brightness and of the @xmath6-parameter  profiles .",
    "this allows us to obtain an analytical formula to estimate it as a function of two observable variables : the azimuthal scatter and the radial distance .",
    "* this relation provides a method to correct the gas density estimates , making it possible to improve consistently the accuracy of the @xmath1  measurements . with this method the systematics",
    "described above disappears completely for relaxed haloes from outside the cluster core up 2@xmath2 . for perturbed clusters",
    "/ groups the overestimate is reduced by a factor of about 3 . *",
    "finally , this method works also in eliminating the bias associated to the measurement of @xmath4  and @xmath5 .",
    "however a large intrinsic scatter ( 57 per cent , in terms of interquartile range ) between the different objects remains .",
    "overall , our results show how the study of the outskirts of galaxy clusters and groups is important for the measurement of the gas mass and gas fraction , and how the combination of simulations and observations can improve their precision . a possible extension and improvement of this analysis",
    "may be investigating the correlation of @xmath0  with other inhomogeneities parameters such as the halo ellipticity , or by determining how the @xmath0@xmath134 relations may vary as a function of the observed relaxation parameters of the haloes .",

    "our volume - clipping method , described in section  [ ssec : volume ] and more in detail in @xcite , allows us to separate between the gas belonging to clumps and to the bulk of the cluster based on theoretical considerations .",

    "[ fig : rhot_clumps ] the @xmath135 scatter plot of the sph particles in the outskirts of the d17-a relaxed cluster . the amount of gas that our algorithm associates to the clumpy phase ( red and green points ) corresponds to about the 3 per cent of the total gas mass inside @xmath2  for this halo .",
    "we verified that in perturbed systems it is slightly higher ( 45 per cent ) . by analysing the plot",
    ", the multi - phase nature of these clumps shows up clearly .",
    "part of the gas is associated to the cold star - forming phase at @xmath136 and @xmath137k .",
    "these particles are responsible for most of the global icm clumpiness ( see the comments on fig .  [",
    "fig : clp_phys ] ) but would not influence any x - ray measurement since their temperature is too low to produce any significant emission .",
    "the majority of clump particles , which usually embed the previous ones , are instead at higher temperature ( @xmath138k ) and can eventually produce a detectable x - ray emission .    of the d17-a simulated cluster for our reference model .",

    "the great homogeneity of the bulk map shows clearly that no clumpy structure is missed by our filtering method and that any possible detectable inhomogeneity must necessarily be associated to the clump phase .",
    "the possibility of detecting them depends on how much their signal is brighter with respect to the bulk one . to this purpose",
    "we identified the map regions where the signal - to - noise ratio exceeds a value of 3 , by considering the bulk map as a reference for the noise .",
    "most of the clumpy structures are at least partially identified with this method , with an increasing efficiency towards the outskirts .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : dclumps ] we show the surface brightness of the identified clumps as a function of distance from the centre , compared to the average cluster surface brightness profile .",
    "since the central part of these clumps is usually very bright , in most of the cases their average surface brightness exceeds the cluster one by more than 5 .",
    "it is clear also , that these structures can be identified also outside @xmath2 , since their signal is well above the unresolved x - ray background , at least in the case of a massive halo .    as a drawback of our method ,",
    "when in a given radial bin no clear clumpy structure is present we consider as clumps also a small fraction of diffuse gas whose signal is not high enough to be identified .",
    "this happens in particular in the regions close to the centre where the icm is more uniform , as it can be seen both in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : clump_maps ] and by the red points of fig .",
    "[ fig : clump_maps ]",
    ". a precise determination of the fraction of clumps that would be missed by real x - ray observations clearly depends on instrumental details and is beyond the aim of our work which focuses on the large - scale inhomogeneities .",
    "however , using our mock maps we can provide an estimate of the amount of missed clumpy gas , together with its influence on the bias of the gas mass measurements .",
    "we verified that the detected clumpy icm ( e.g. green particles in fig .",
    "[ fig : clump_maps ] ) is the @xmath320 per cent of the total amount of gas associated to clumps by our volume - clipping method . in order to have an estimate of its impact on the mass gas measurement",

    "we obtained a value of @xmath93@xmath1@xmath139 per cent for the relaxed sample , with respect to the previous 6.1 ( see table  [ tab : bestfit ] ) obtained with our more conservative threshold .",
    "therefore , given the relatively small difference , we conclude that the impact on our results of any unresolved clumpy gas is minor with respect to the one associated to large - scale inhomogeneities .     as a function of distance from the centre .",
