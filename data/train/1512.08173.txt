    "more `` physical '' renormalization schemes , such as `` momentum subtraction '' ( @xmath28 ) [ 7,8,9 ] or the `` @xmath29-scheme '' which relies on calculating the effective potential between two heavy quarks [ 10,11,12 ] are taken to generate perturbative results that are better approximations to the exact result than these derived using @xmath30 .",
