    "then we develop the consequences of these relations in  [ gc ] culminating in the calculation of the @xmath0-analogue of the fierz coefficients .",
    "my intention has been to ensure that the paper can be read at this level with no background beyond an understanding of skein relations .",

    "although this book only appeared recently the content was worked out around thirty years ago when it was ahead of its time",
    ".    however the paper is motivated and informed by several other subjects and it seems appropriate to give some account of these subjects in a comparatively lengthy introduction .",
    "the reason for this is that although each of these subjects is individually well - known i anticipate that there is a comparitively small audience who will be familiar with all of these topics .",
    "these topics are ; creation and annihilation operators from quantum field theory , the representation theory of the drinfeld - jimbo quantised enveloping algebras and spin network evaluations .",
    "this is achieved by introducing the spin representation in this context and developing the associated recoupling theory .",

    "we will be using diagrams to represent tensors .",
    "in particular the labels on the edges of diagrams are not indices but are used to denote different representations . here we discuss the various notations for the classical clifford relations .",
    "let @xmath1 be a vector space with a symmetric inner product , @xmath2 .",
    "then in the mathematics literature the clifford algebra of @xmath1 , @xmath3 , is defined to be an algebra @xmath3 with an inclusion of vector spaces @xmath4 which is universal with the property that the following clifford relations hold @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",

    "consists in the following steps .",
    "assume the diagram has been drawn in general position with respect to the height function on the page .",
    "then take the set of vertices to be the trivalent vertices and the critical points .",
    "take the edges to be the lines connecting these vertices .",
    "put an index @xmath12 on each dashed line ( with a different index for each line ) and an index @xmath20 on each solid line ( also all different ) .",
    "then for each vertex write the tensor @xmath16 or @xmath21 with the indices corresponding to the edges .",
    "then all the internal edges have contracted indices . in a linear combination of diagrams or in an equation the indices on the boundary edges",
    "are required to be the same for all the diagrams .",
    "leaving aside aesthetic considerations and personal prejudices there are two reasons for preferring the diagram notation over the index notation .",
    "the first reason is that there is a choice involved in drawing the diagram in general position .",
    "there are ( infinitely ) many index expressions which represent the same tensor and which are all represented by the same diagram .",
    "one effect of this is that the proofs in index notation become longer as each isotopy of diagrams has to be replaced by a sequence of tensors related by standard tensor identities .",

    "the diagrams in this paper can only be taken to be tensors if @xmath22 for some integer @xmath23 .      on a first reading of this paper the ring of scalars",
