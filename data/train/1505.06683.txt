    "spin foam models arise from a covariant formulation of loop quantum gravity .",
    "these models are usually developed on a triangulated manifold and defined by an amplitude associated with the simplices of the triangulation .",
    "a crucial tool in understanding the semi - classical regime of a spin - foam amplitude is the analysis of its asymptotic behavior .",
    "when ponzano and regge discovered that the asymptotics of the 6j - symbol in recoupling theory contain the discrete regge action for gr @xcite , they established the first quantum model for euclidean 3d gravity .",
    "the ponzano - regge model was generalized in spin - foam models of 4d gravity . in the papers",
    "were developed euclidean and lorentzian versions of what came to be known as the eprl model .",
    "the asymptotics of the euclidean eprl model were studied in .",
    "it was found that in the semi - classical regime the eprl amplitude contains several terms made of exponentials of the regge action with different overall coefficients and different signs , instead of one exponential term .",
    "when dealing with multiple 4-simplices these extra terms give rise to unphysical equations of motion and perhaps are a cause of bubble divergences @xcite .",
    "the presence of similar problematic terms was discovered for the lorentzian eprl model in .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the appearance of these terms is caused by the presence of different combinations of dynamical orientations and plebanski sectors of solutions to the simplicity constraint . the combination of plebanski sectors and orientations yielding the one feynman - like term equal to the exponential of exactly @xmath0 times the regge action was named the _ einstein - hilbert sector_. this name arises from the fact that , in continuum plebanski theory this is the sector in which the action reduces to einstein - hilbert .",
    "these observations led to the proposal in @xcite to quantize the restriction to the einstein - hilbert sector by inserting an appropriate projector into the amplitude , thereby eliminating the additional terms .    in @xcite",
    "this strategy was implemented to modify the lorentzian eprl amplitude and define what is called the _ lorentzian proper vertex amplitude_. in this paper we study the asymptotics of the lorentzian proper vertex amplitude and verify that the semi - classical regime of the new amplitude is indeed dominated by a single term , the exponential of the regge action .",
    "the analysis is performed by writing the amplitude in a path - integral form , splitting the action into a modified eprl part and a projector action part , and using stationary phase methods to study the large - spin limit .",
    "however , the non - linear dependence of the projector action on spins as well as discontinuities in this term where the parallel transports are degenerate , significantly complicates the analysis when one is careful . as a consequence",
    "new strategies are used in this paper to extend the stationary phase methods to the case of non - linear actions as well as to handle the points of discontinuity .",
    "the present analysis restricts consideration to the case of boundary states for which there are no degenerate critical points .",
    "thus the present analysis includes , in particular , the most physically relevant case of boundary data , namely that of those which fit onto a non - degenerate lorentzian 4-simplex .",
    "note this paper concerns only verifying the correct _ phase _ of the asymptotics of the proper vertex .",
    "this is the most important part of the asymptotics to check as it is necessary to ensure that the classical equations of motion dominate the spin - foam sum in the semi - classical limit .",
    "the other part of the asymptotics  the modulus  determines the effective measure factor of the path integral , which is important for determining formal equivalence with canonical quantization @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a brief review of the key equations and prior results needed for the paper are given in section [ sec : prelim ] . in section",
    "[ sec : propasym ] we formulate the amplitude in integral form , consider the critical points of the action and calculate their contribution to asymptotics , which is the main result of the paper . in section [ sec",
    ": completion ] , we present the technical argument justifying the use of stationary phase methods for evaluating the asymptotics . in particular , we derive the asymptotic form of the non - linear part of the action , show that the usual stationary phase theorem applies to the part of the vertex integral containing all critical points , and show that the contribution from the rest of the vertex integral is suppressed .",
    "to define a vertex amplitude we consider a single 4-simplex with tetrahedra labelled @xmath1 and triangles labelled by unordered pairs @xmath2 .",
    "the boundary hilbert space is spanned by generalized spin - network states , in which each triangle is labelled by a spin @xmath3 and two vectors @xmath4 in the corresponding irreducible representation of @xmath5 . for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "we use coherent boundary states consisting in spin - network states with the vectors @xmath4 chosen to be perelomov coherent states ( @xcite ) associated to two unit spinors @xmath6 ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "each two - spinor @xmath7 determines a unit @xmath8-vector via @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the usual pauli matrices .",
    "both the set @xmath11 and the set @xmath12 which they determined , are called _ boundary data _ for the 4-simplex .",
    "given @xmath12 , @xmath11 is uniquely determined up to a phase for each spinor . the boundary data @xmath12 determine a geometry for each tetrahedron @xcite , and are called _ regge - like _ when these geometries glue together consistently to define a boundary geometry of a 4-simplex .",
    "in this case one can fix the phase of the boundary state leading to what is called a _",
    "regge state _ , which we denote @xmath13 .",
    "the boundary data @xmath12 is called a _ vector geometry _ when the determined tetrahedra can be rotated in @xmath14 such that triangle @xmath2 in tetrahedron @xmath15 is parallel to triangle @xmath2 in tetrahedron @xmath16 , with opposite orientation , for all @xmath17 .    in ,",
    "the asymptotics of the lorentzian eprl vertex amplitude were analyzed and found to be governed by critical points of an action .",

    "the asymptotic analysis of the proper eprl - vertex is carried out in almost the same manner as in : using coherent boundary states , the amplitude is rewritten in terms of the exponential of an action and then the critical points are calculated . however , two additional subtleties appear : ( 1 . ) the scaling behavior under @xmath57 of the new term in the action is not linear in @xmath30 , but only asymptotically linear , and ( 2 . )",
