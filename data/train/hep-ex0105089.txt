    "in a recent paper  @xcite we have published the first data on the helicity dependence of the @xmath9 reactions in the energy range from 200 to 450 mev . in the present paper",
    "we present the helicity dependence of the total photoabsorption cross section on the proton in the photon energy range from 200 to 800 mev .",
    "these data give , in particular , important experimental information about the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule and the forward spin polarizability @xmath3 .",
    "the gdh sum rule relates the total absorption cross section of circularly polarized photons on longitudinally polarized nucleons to the static properties of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the two relative spin configurations , parallel or antiparallel , determine the two absorption cross sections @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the integral over the photon energy @xmath12 of the difference of these two cross sections , weighted by the inverse of @xmath12 , is related to the mass , @xmath13 , and anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath14 , of the nucleon as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pion photoproduction threshold and @xmath17 the fine - structure constant . in a similar way",
    ", the forward spin polarizability @xmath3 can be expressed as : @xmath18 the gdh sum rule , formulated in the 1960 s , rests upon basic physics principles ( lorentz - invariance , gauge invariance , unitarity ) and an unsubtracted dispersion relation applied to the forward compton amplitude .",
    "due to its fundamental character this prediction requires an experimental verification which has been awaiting technical developments that have only recently been achieved .    in the absence of any direct experimental result some theoretical predictions of the gdh integral",
    "have been made in the past years .",
    "they are compared to the gdh sum rule in table  [ tab_pred ] .",
    "all predictions were based on multipole analyses of the existing single pion photoproduction data ( mainly unpolarized differential and total cross sections and some single polarization observables ) and included an evaluation of the contribution of double pion photoproduction processes . with the exception of ref .",
    "@xcite , this contribution has been taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an additional contribution due to multi - hadron production processes was phenomenologically evaluated using a regge type approach .    apart from ref .",
    "@xcite , all of the theoretical predictions consistently exceed the sum rule value for the proton while for the neutron they come out much smaller than the sum rule . however , the gdh integrand is an oscillating function of photon energy , due to multipole contributions of alternating sign .",
    "therefore , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a reliable prediction requires a very high accuracy that has probably not been reached by any of the existing models , in particular for the neutron .",
    "precise experimental data are required to pin down the detailed behaviour of the gdh integrand .",
    "the experimental setup has been described previously in detail @xcite and only the main characteristics are given here .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the tagged photon facility  @xcite of the mami accelerator in mainz .",
    "circularly polarized photons were produced by bremsstrahlung of longitudinally polarized electrons  @xcite . the electron polarization ( routinely about @xmath19 )",
    "was monitored during the data taking by means of a mller polarimeter with a precision of @xmath20 .",
    "the photon energy was determined by the glasgow - mainz tagging spectrometer having an energy resolution of about 2  mev  @xcite .",
    "the tagging efficiency was monitored with an accuracy of @xmath21 by an @xmath22 detector placed downstream of the main hadron detector@xcite .",
    "longitudinally polarized protons were provided by a frozen - spin butanol ( c@xmath23h@xmath24oh ) target  @xcite .",
    "the proton polarization was measured using nmr techniques with a precision of @xmath25 , the target density was known with a precision of @xmath26 .",
    "maximum polarization values close to 90% were obtained with a typical relaxation time of @xmath27 200 hours .",
    "photoemitted hadrons were registered by a @xmath28  sr system based on the large acceptance detector daphne  @xcite complemented by detectors  @xcite to extend the forward polar angle acceptance .",
    "daphne is essentially a charged particle tracking detector with cylindrical symmetry .",
    "an outer double scintillator - absorber sandwich also allows the detection of neutral pions with a moderate ( @xmath29 ) efficiency .",
    "it covers polar angles from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "in this paper , data recorded by the daphne detector only are presented .",
    "an inclusive method of data analysis has been developed to determine the total absorption cross section .",
    "it has already been applied to an unpolarized measurement . since",
    "its features are described in @xcite , only the general characteristics will be recalled here .",
    "a large fraction of the total photoabsorption cross section ( @xmath32 ) can be directly accessed by measuring the number of events with charged hadrons in the final state ( @xmath33 ) detected inside the daphne acceptance .",
    "most of the remaining part is deduced from the measured number of @xmath34 events , with no accompanying charged particle observed ( @xmath35 ) , by using the @xmath34 detection efficiency ( @xmath36 ) evaluated by a simulation . since @xmath36 is finite for all @xmath34 energies and angles ,",
    "no extrapolation is needed for the partial channels having at least one neutral pion in the final state .",
    "a small correction ( @xmath37 ) has to be made since processes involving more than one @xmath34 in the final state are not included in the evaluation of @xmath36 .",
    "an additional correction @xmath38 is needed to take into account the fraction of the events from the charged pion channels ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) emitted into the angular and momentum regions outside of the detector acceptance . for e@xmath41 200 mev ,",
    "the region for which the data are presented , the lower momentum limit for the photoemitted @xmath42 from the @xmath39 reaction is above the detection threshold .",
    "therefore , no correction for the losses due to the detector momentum acceptance is necessary for this channel .    using the notation above",
    ", @xmath32 can be written as : @xmath43    in fig .",
    "[ stot_unpol ] , the values of @xmath32 obtained with an unpolarized liquid hydrogen target during a test run , carried out prior to the main experiment , are shown . in this case , @xmath44 ( about 5% of @xmath32 ) was evaluated starting from the experimental single charged pion spectra .",
    "the total systematic error on the data is @xmath45 of @xmath32 .    in the same figure ,",
    "our data are compared to previous results  @xcite and to the hdt prediction from hanstein et al .",
    "@xcite ( up to e@xmath46 = 450 mev ) , the said  @xcite multipole analysis and the unitary isobar model ( uim )  @xcite .",
    "the uim model takes into account double pion and @xmath47 photoproduction in addition to single pion production .",
    "the good agreement found with the old data and with the different models , demonstrates that the detector response is well understood .    in the analysis of the data from the polarized butanol target , the background contribution from the reactions produced on the unpolarized c and o nuclei of the target",
    "could not be fully separated from the polarized h contribution  @xcite .",
    "the inclusive method was then used to evaluate the difference @xmath48 @xmath49 of the two helicity dependent total cross sections @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "however , the extrapolation of the charged pion photoproduction channels could not be done as in the unpolarized case . in the following ,",
    "we briefly describe the procedures that were used .",
    "the angular extrapolation needed for the @xmath50 channel was evaluated using the said  @xcite multipole analysis , which reproduced well our previous experimental results of the helicity dependence of this reaction channel in the @xmath51 resonance region  @xcite . as a systematic error , @xmath52 of the evaluated correction",
    "is taken for e@xmath53 mev , while at higher energies , @xmath54 of the evaluated correction is assumed .    the correction for the unmeasured part of the @xmath40 channel",
    "was evaluated under the assumption that the helicity asymmetry @xmath55 in the unmeasured part is the same as the one measured inside the daphne acceptance  @xcite .",
    "the correction for the @xmath56 channel was evaluated similarly  @xcite . for the @xmath57 channel , which couples to the @xmath58 resonance and therefore has a dominant @xmath11 contribution , an helicity asymmetry of @xmath59 was assumed , following the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite . for the last three contributions , a systematic error equal to @xmath60 of the evaluated correction is assumed .",
    "the remaining sources of systematic errors are due to uncertainties in wire chamber efficiency ( 1% of @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 detection efficiency ( @xmath61 of @xmath62 .",
    "the dominant contribution to the systematic error stems from uncertainties in photon flux , target density and beam and target polarizations ; their sum in quadrature is about @xmath61 of @xmath63 .",
    "[ tabsyserr ] summarizes for two energies the different contributions to @xmath64 together with their systematic errors and gives the total systematic error obtained by summing in quadrature all contributions .",
    "the analysis procedure as described above results in the total cross section difference @xmath65 depicted in fig .  [ stot_pol ]",
    "it is compared with the sum of our previously published helicity differences for the @xmath39 and @xmath66 channels in the @xmath67 region  @xcite .",
    "the good agreement found between the different analyses gives us confidence in their reliabilty .",
    "in the same figure , our data are also compared to the hdt  @xcite , said  @xcite , and uim  @xcite analyses .    in the @xmath67 resonance region , there is a rather good agreement between experiment and theories . in the second resonance region ,",
    "a significant contribution from double pion photoproduction is clearly visible .",
    "this feature is not completely reproduced by the uim model .    in fig .",
    "[ integ_gdh ] the experimental running gdh integral ( left - hand side of eq.[eq1 ] ) is displayed and compared to the model predictions .",
    "the integration starts at e@xmath68  mev and the upper integration limit is taken as the running variable .",
    "the measured value of the gdh integral between 200 and 800 mev amounts to @xmath69b . due to the @xmath70 weighting ,",
    "the @xmath3 running integral is almost saturated by e@xmath71  mev .",
    "the value of the @xmath3 integral between 200 and 800 mev amounts to @xmath72\\cdot 10^{-6}~\\hbox{\\rm fm}^4 $ ] .",
    "although the measured photon energy interval is too narrow to draw any definitive conclusion , a reasonable estimate of the gdh sum rule value can be deduced if we use the existing models for the evaluation of the missing contributions .",
    "the uim model @xcite gives a contribution of @xmath73b for e@xmath74  mev and @xmath75b for @xmath76 e@xmath77  mev . for e@xmath78  mev , ref .",
    "@xcite gives a contribution of -26 @xmath5b .",
    "the combination of our experimental result with these predictions yields an estimate ( 210 @xmath5b ) which within the experimental errors is consistent with the gdh sum rule value ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "it should be kept in mind that , especially above e@xmath71  mev , none of the models has yet been validated experimentally and only a measurement in this energy region can lead to a definitive conclusion about the high energy contribution to the gdh - integral .",
    "our collaboration is performing such a measurement at elsa ( bonn ) up to e@xmath79  gev , and extensions to higher energies are under way or in preparation at jefferson lab  @xcite and slac  @xcite .    in case of the @xmath3-integral ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "the contribution from e@xmath80  mev is important , the uim prediction being @xmath81 @xmath8 .",
    "the missing high energy contribution , according to uim and ref .",
    "@xcite , is @xmath82 @xmath8 only .",
    "the combination with our experimental result gives an estimate of @xmath83 @xmath8 for @xmath3 .",
    "several predictions , based on dispersion relations @xcite and chiral perturbation theory @xcite , have been made for @xmath3 in the last few years , see table [ tab_spin ] .",
    "they range from @xmath84 to @xmath85 ) @xmath86 .",
