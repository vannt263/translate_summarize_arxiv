    "the understanding of flavor constitutes one of the most stubborn open challenges in particle physics  @xcite .",
    "two aspects of the problem are the understanding of fermion mass hierarchies as well as mixing parameters .",
    "various types of flavor symmetries have been invoked in this context  @xcite .",
    "these efforts have been partly motivated by the original success of the tri - bimaximal mixing ansatz  @xcite .",
    "the resulting non - abelian flavor symmetries are typically broken spontaneously down to two different residual subgroups in the neutrino and the charged lepton sectors , leading to zero reactor mixing parameter , @xmath1 .",
    "however , the measurement of a non - zero value for the reactor angle  @xcite implies the need to revamp the original flavor symmetry - based approaches in order to generate @xmath2",
    "@xcite or else look for alternative possibilities , such as bi - large neutrino mixing  @xcite .",
    "the existence of warped extra - dimensions has been advocated by randall & sundrum  @xcite as a way to address the hierarchy problem , since the fundamental scale of gravity is exponentially reduced from the planck mass down to the tev scale as a result of having the higgs sector localized near the boundary of the extra dimensions . moreover , if standard model fermions are allowed to propagate in the bulk and also become localized towards either brane , the scenario can also address the flavor problem possibly acting in synergy with the flavor group predictions .",
    "this is what we do in the present paper .",
    "the idea of combining discrete flavor symmetries and extra dimensions is quite attractive and has already been discussed in the literature within the context of large extra dimensions  @xcite , warped extra dimensions  @xcite and holographic composite higgs models  @xcite .",
    "however , such models try to generate tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing , which has been ruled out by the measurement of the reactor angle @xmath3  @xcite and also global fits of neutrino oscillation data  @xcite .",
    "one of us has constructed a warped extra dimension model with @xmath4 flavor symmetry where democratic mixing is produced at leading order and non - zero @xmath3 can arise from subleading corrections  @xcite . in this work , we shall re - consider the issue of predicting flavor properties in particle physics by combining the conventional predictive power inherent in the use of non - abelian flavor symmetries with the presence of warped extra - dimensions .",
    "we propose a warped five - dimensional scenario in which all matter fields propagate in the bulk and neutrinos are treated as dirac particles .",
    "our model can accommodate all the strengths of the standard model yukawa couplings and resulting fermion mass hierarchies by making adequate choices of fermion bulk mass parameters , while the fermion mixing parameters can be restricted by means of the assumed flavor symmetry .",
    "we present a @xmath0 based flavor symmetry which nicely describes the neutrino oscillation parameters in terms of just two independent parameters , leading to interesting correlations involving the neutrino mass hierarchy and the leptonic dirac cp phase , not yet reliably determined by current global oscillation fit  @xcite .",
    "our predictions include a neat leading order relation between the solar and reactor mixing parameters which should be tested at future oscillation experiments .",
    "in this section we present the basic setup of a warped five - dimensional ( 5d ) model for fermions , constructed under a @xmath5 flavor symmetry .",

    "the fifth dimension @xmath10 is compactified on @xmath11 , and two flat 3-branes of opposite tension are attached to the orbifold fixed points , located at @xmath12 ( uv brane ) and @xmath13 ( ir brane ) .",

    "the gauge group @xmath16 breaks down to the standard model electroweak ( ew ) group @xmath17 on the uv brane by the boundary conditions ( bcs ) of the gauge bosons .",
    "furthermore , a bulk higgs field with @xmath18 quantum numbers @xmath19 is responsible for the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of @xmath20 .",
    "the 5d higgs field @xmath21 can be decomposed into kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes as @xmath22 for an adequate choice of bcs , its zero mode profile @xmath23 can be written as  @xcite @xmath24 where we have introduced the higgs localization parameter @xmath25 in terms of the higgs field bulk mass parameter @xmath26 . in the present work",
    ", we assume that the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs zero mode is of the form @xmath27 and it is peaked toward the ir brane , allowing for a tev scale ew ssb and inducing the @xmath16 breakdown to @xmath28 on that brane .",
    "three families of fermion fields are required to describe each generation ( labeled by @xmath29 ) of quarks and leptons .",
