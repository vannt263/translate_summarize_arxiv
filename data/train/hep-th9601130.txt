    "<S> the sequence of intertwined t - s - t duality transformations was first proposed by i.bakas [ [ bakas ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> he argued that if one performs t - s - t duality transformations on a pure gravitational background with one killing symmetry , one obtains a new background which will always be pure gravitational as well . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it turns out that t - s - t can be considered as a sl(2,@xmath1 ) transformation in the space of string background metrics . </S>",
    "<S> this sl(2,@xmath1 ) coincides with the action of the ehlers - geroch sl(2,@xmath1 ) symmetry group of vacuum einstein spaces upon reduction from four to three dimensions [ [ ehlers ] ] provided that there is at least one killing symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> + it is known that an exact conformal field theory describing a black hole in 2d space - time is an sl(2,@xmath1)/u(1 ) gauged wzw model [ [ witt ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> t - duality acting on such a background is well understood and leads to stringy properties of the black hole [ [ giveon],[luest ] ] . in the case of a euclidean space - time </S>",
    "<S> the so called semi - infinite cigar is transformed to an infinite funnel . for a lorentzian space - time duality interchanges different regions in the kruskal - szekeres coordinates[[witt ] , [ giveon ] ] , </S>",
    "<S> especially duality exchanges the horizon with the singularity and the asymptotically flat space - time , which corresponds to the lorentzian cigar , with the space - time inside the black hole singularity . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it has been shown that the 2d black hole is self dual . </S>",
    "<S> + dual geometries of 4d black holes were studied in [ [ q1],[q2],[q3],[q4 ] ] . in [ [ q1 ] ] the t - duality transformation was applied to time translations of the schwarzschild metric . </S>",
    "<S> the dual metric defined a geometry with naked singularities at @xmath2 and @xmath3 and remained a spherically symmetric solution of the string background equations , but was not a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> further it was shown [ [ q1 ] ] that a dual geometry with respect to the so(3 ) symmetry , i.e. duality with respect to non - abelian isometries is neither spherically symmetric nor asymtotically flat . </S>",
    "<S> + in the sequel we will show that the sequence of intertwined t - s - t duality transformations acting on the 4d black hole solution produces a new spherically symmetric background that is asymtotically flat and has a singularity at @xmath3 and a horizon at @xmath2 . in particular we will show that t - s - t duality transformation acts on the 4d static black hole just like the t - duality on the 2d black hole . before starting with t - s - t </S>",
    "<S> let us recall that the action of t - duality for a nontrivial field configuration involving the metric , dilaton and antisymmetric tensor which are independent of the time coordinate is given by ( for a review of t - duality [ [ giveon2 ] ] ) :    @xmath4    where 0 denotes the time direction . in order for the dual geometries to give string vacua they have to satisfy the string background equations to lowest order in @xmath5 [ [ giveon2],[perry ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> +   + the 4d uncharged static black hole solution can be regarded as special case of a gravitational string background with zero dilaton @xmath6 and anti - symmetric tensor field @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the isometry group of the schwarzschild metric is given by time translations together with the so(3 ) space rotations . </S>",
    "<S> +   + the metric can be given in the form :    @xmath8    the metric is singular for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> one can show [ [ hawking ] ] that @xmath2 is a real singularity but @xmath3 just a coordinate singularity , reflecting deficiency in the used coordinate system and therefore being removable . </S>",
    "<S> if one calculates the riemann tensor scalar invariant one finds :    @xmath9    the scalar is finite at @xmath3 and diverges for @xmath10 . + </S>",
    "<S> * * + if we perform a t - duality transformation with respect to the t - coordinate we get the dual metric :    @xmath11    and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the dilaton is given by :    @xmath13    metric and dilaton solve the string - frame background equations . </S>",
    "<S> if we switch to the einstein - frame then the metric takes the form :    @xmath14    this metric defines a geometry with naked singularities at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as it was already pointed out [ [ q1 ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> we can verify this by computing the dual scalar curvature    @xmath15    it is instructiv to compute again the riemann tensor scalar invariant which is given by    @xmath16    a t - duality transformation of the 4d black hole gives us a spherically symmetric solution of the string background equations with two naked singularties which is not a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> + * * + now we perform a s - duality transformation [ [ lu ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath17 and s - duality reduces to    @xmath18    and we set @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the metric in the einstein - frame remains fixed under s - duality and is given by    @xmath20    if we go back to the string - frame , we will find the metric    @xmath21    which together with the dilaton    @xmath22    solves the equation of motion in the string - frame . </S>",
    "<S> + * * + we perform finally a t - duality transformation with respect to the t - coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> the t - s - t dual metric to the former schwarzschild metric is then given by :    @xmath23    the dual dilaton vanishes :    @xmath24    it is easy to check that the equation of motion are satisfied by the t - s - t dual metric . </S>",
    "<S> the metric becomes singular at @xmath2 and @xmath3 but a calculation of the riemann scalar invariant suggests that @xmath2 is not a real physical singularity , but rather one which is a result of a bad choice of coordinates like @xmath3 in the schwarzschild solution . </S>",
    "<S> the invariant is given by :    @xmath25    the curvature invariant takes at @xmath26 the same value as the invariant coming from the schwarzschild metric . </S>",
    "<S> our new space - time is defined for @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the case of the schwarzschild solution we have to check if @xmath2 is a null hypersurface dividing the manifold into two disconnected components :    @xmath28    inside region ii the coordinates t and r reverse their character ( t - spacelike , r - timelike ) . </S>",
    "<S> + to get a better understanding of our new solution we have to prove that our solution can be extended when r tends to 0 . </S>",
    "<S> i will follow the maximal extension procedure for the known schwarzschild solution [ [ hawking ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> we start with a congruence of ingoing radial null geodesics given by    @xmath29    and @xmath30 defines outgoing radial null geodesics . in the following we suppress the integration constant @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> now we change to a new time coordinate in which the ingoing geodesics become straight lines    @xmath32    if we differentiate this equation with respect to r and substituting it for dt in the line element @xmath33 , we find a new line element that we call dual eddington - finkelstein line element    @xmath34    this solution is regular for the whole range @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> our transformation @xmath36 extends the coordinate range from @xmath37 to @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the time reversed solution for outgoing radial null geodesics can be obtained by introducing another time coordinate @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> if we introduce an advanced and a retarded null coordinate    @xmath40    the corresponding dual eddington - finkelstein metric becomes :    @xmath41    if we compare with the original advanced and retarded solutions coming from the schwarzschild line element [ [ hawking ] ] we will find the advanced ( retarded ) dual solution coincide at @xmath26 with the retarded ( advanced ) original solution , latter are given by :    @xmath42    now let us make both extensions simultaneously , then we will get @xmath33 in the coordinates @xmath43 :    @xmath44    where r is determined implicitly by @xmath45 . for constant @xmath46 and @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding two - space is conformally flat which can be seen by defining @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this two - space will be invariant under @xmath49 and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> if we define @xmath51 as    @xmath52    and introduce @xmath53 and @xmath54 we find the maximal extended line element and call it dual kruskal line element ( where we have included now the integration constant @xmath31 ) :    @xmath55    the kruskal diagram is given by :    @xmath56    at this point it would be reasonable to consider the original kruskal line element given by    @xmath57    kruskal s choice of the functions @xmath58 was @xmath59 , @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding diagram is given by :    @xmath61    we observe that we can map the original solution to the dual via :    @xmath62    we have found a new background which solves the background field equations , that is singular at @xmath3 and has a horizon at @xmath2 . in particular t - s - t interchanges two asymptotically flat space - times both of which have a maximal extension . </S>",
    "<S> t - s - t duality interchanges region i ( @xmath63 ) with region v ( @xmath27 ) while region ii ( @xmath35 ) is transformed to itself ( analog iv , vi are interchanged and iii is transformed to itself ) . </S>",
    "<S> further , we can conclude from our analysis above that a test - string can not distinguish if he moves on a ingoing radial null geodesic into the black hole or if he leaves a white hole in the dual geometry . that offers the possibility that a test - string does not see the singularity </S>",
    "<S> . from m@xmath64 m follows that the dual mass measured by an observer in region i is negativ .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 4,4 )    all these facts are similar to the 2d case discussed in [ [ giveon ] ] . in the case of </S>",
    "<S> the 2d black hole one finds the positiv - mass black hole is dualized to a negative - mass solution , i.e. there is a mapping under duality of the asymptotically flat region to the region ` beyond ' the singularity . </S>",
    "<S> both regions are incorporated as different sectors of a single exact conformal field theory . </S>",
    "<S> note that our discussed solutions are exact only in the leading order of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> finally one has to keep in mind , although the physical equivalence of the dual solutions is expected to hold whenever the symmetry on which the dualization is based is compact , their equivalence for non - compact symmetries is not quite clear until now . about exactness in the compact and non - compact case </S>",
    "<S> see for instance [ [ q3],[roc],[kirt ] ] . </S>",
