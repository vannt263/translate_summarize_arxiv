    "[ fig : models ] ( right ) , the emission from swept up circumstellar and shocked ejecta is initially comparable in the s12d , s25d , and sn  1993j models , but the emission from shocked ejecta quickly surpasses that of the shocked circumstellar material by a factor of two or more .",
    "interestingly , and previously pointed out in @xcite , there is no appreciable fe - k emission from shocked ejecta in the sn  1987a models , even at late times ( our models do show that the fe - k emission from shocked ejecta does begin to appear at late times , though remains very weak ) .",
    "the sn  1987a model differs from the other models in two aspects : first , it is a compact blue progenitor , and the densities in the ejecta are higher than in the other models with extended h - rich envelopes , and secondly , the fe abundance in the sn  1987a model is @xmath8 two orders of magnitude lower than in the other models there is not a significant amount of fe to shock in the ejecta .",

    "we discuss these results in more detail below .",
    "@xcite typed several galactic snrs based on the properties of the swept up circumstellar material , classifying many as either type iib / l or type iip .",
    "main sequence progenitors for type iip and iib / l sn span a mass range of 1025 m@xmath2 , and have slow dense winds resulting in much of the lost mass remaining close to the progenitor .",

    "as seen in figure  [ fig : models ] ( left ) , while there is generally good agreement between the supernova explosion models and the bulk properties , several core ",
    "collapse measurements stand out as having higher than average fe - k line luminosities : cas a , n132d , w49b , and n63a . in the case of cas",
    "a , it appears likely that there was bulk overturning of the deepest layers of ejecta during the explosion @xcite .",
    "this resulted in the fe - rich ejecta being brought to the surface during the explosion .",

    "@xcite postulated that w49b is the result of a bipolar type ib / c sn , based on the morphology and other spectral characteristics .",
    "however , the low csm densities inferred from x - ray and radio observations to be around ib / c progenitors ( e.g. , sn  2007gr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appears incongruent with a high fe - k charge state and line luminosity in the spectrum of w49b .",
    "type ib / c sne probably result from wolf - rayet stars with fast winds and high mechanical luminosities .",
    "compared to red and yellow supergiant progenitors , the 100@xmath19 faster wind velocities in wr progenitors transport much of the circumstellar material to larger distances , leaving behind a largely low density csm cavity , though evidence does exist for more complex environments around some sn  ic , such as in the case of sn  2007bg , which appears to have underwent several differing mass  loss phases prior to the sn @xcite .    additionally , @xcite found evidence for an overionized plasma in w49b , as evidenced by the ratio of h to he  like lines ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite recently presented a model for snrs that show overionized plasmas , and suggested that red supergiants can deposit the mass required for rapid ionization close enough to the progenitor to overionize the shocked material at early times .",
    "he noted that the time required to reach ionization equilibrium in a rsg wind is @xmath8 100@xmath19 faster than in a w - r wind , unless collisional ionization equilibrium in the w - r wind occurs almost immediately after the explosion @xcite .",
    "however , an emergent class of supernovae typed as ibn has recently been discovered that displays a strong circumstellar interaction like those found in iin s as well as no h in the early time optical spectra , like ib s , such as sn  2006cj @xcite and sn  2011w @xcite .",
    "the progenitors of these systems include wolf - rayet and lbvs with zero age main sequence masses m @xmath1 40 m@xmath2 , and possibly display eruptive events just prior to the sn @xcite .",
    "a progenitor such as this may explain both the overionization and high fe abundance observed in w49b and reconcile these apparently contradictory results with theory . in any event",
    ", detailed modeling of a w49b - like progenitor , explosion , and subsequent evolution might be required to explain this odd object .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : dyn_spec ] ( right ) , our modeled line luminosities fall below the observed values for many remnants .",
    "here we argue that this may be associated with issues related to the very end stages of the progenitor s evolution .",
    "while the observed snr radii appear consistent with the modeled radii , the luminosities differ by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "so the question is whether one can increase the luminosity without strongly impacting the radius . for core ",
    "collapse supernovae , the forward shock radius @xmath34 @xmath29 @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "thus if one were to increase the mass  loss rate prior to the supernova , we can estimate the change in blastwave radius as a function of change in @xmath9 .",
    "first , from @xcite , the blastwave radius is :    @xmath36^{1/(n - s)}t^{\\frac{n-3}{n - s } } \\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is a constant , dependent upon the shape of the ejecta and circumstellar environment , @xmath31 is the power law index that describes the shape of the ejecta , and @xmath38 is the power law index that describes the circumstellar environment . in this paper ,",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is a constant , dependent upon the ejecta mass and explosion energy .",
    "@xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 .",
    "if the mass  loss rate is increased by some amount @xmath43 prior to the supernova ( @xmath44 ) , such that the blastwave radius is now @xmath45 , then the fractional change in the radius , over the extent of time that the blastwave moves through the circumstellar shell is :    @xmath46    for large changes in the mass  loss rate , this effect can be quite large .",
    "for instance , an order of magnitude increase in the mass  loss rate results in a 30% decrease in the blastwave radius .",
    "however , we do not expect this increased mass  loss to persist for very long , so the extent of the circumstellar medium occupied by the increased density is small , essentially amounting to a thin circumstellar shell .",
    "after the blastwave breaks through this shell , it will accelerate into the lower density slow rsg wind .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray luminosity l@xmath47 @xmath8 n@xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of free electrons , @xmath50 is the cooling function , and @xmath51 is the emitting volume . since @xmath49 @xmath29 @xmath9 ,",
    "l@xmath47 @xmath8 @xmath52 . a three - fold increase in the mass  loss rate will result in an approximately order of magnitude increase in l@xmath47 , an increase in collisional ionization , and thus an increase in fe - k line emission .",
    "thus , the problem posed by figure  [ fig : dyn_spec ] ( right ) can be qualitatively addressed by altering the density of the circumstellar environment close to the progenitor .",
    "this could be viewed as akin to higher mass  loss just prior to the supernova .",
    "we note that this argument may break down for shells that are sufficiently dense to cause significant radiative losses @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dyn_spec ] ( left ) we plot the modeled and observed fe - k line centroid versus snr radii . as shown in figure  [ fig : models ] , the energy centroids for both the model and data are generally greater than 6550 ev .",

    "however , some snrs , g292.0 + 1.8 in particular , do not agree with any of the models . interestingly , in the line luminosity versus radii plots , g292.0 + 1.8 also does not agree with the models .",
    "this may point to a more complicated circumstellar environment around g292.0 + 1.8 , evidence of which is seen in x - ray observations @xcite .",

    "to supernova remnants , more detailed studies of young snrs such as sn  1993j , sn  1996c , and ngc  4449 - 1 are required in order to bridge the gap between truly young objects and galactic remnants .",
    "additionally , studies of these objects will allow us to probe the mass  loss history of the progenitor at times @xmath25 10@xmath53 years before the explosion .",
    "future concept x - ray missions with both high imaging and spectral resolution , such as _ smart - x _ will foster the detection and study of nearby extragalactic snrs which can be added to the sample discussed here .    finally , understanding the mass  loss of supernova progenitors remains a challenge . in this study , we simplified the circumstellar environment to be from a a steady wind , though there is substantial evidence that steady line - driven winds may not be prevalent .",
    "understanding clumping in winds as well as episodic mass  loss will be important , as these processes may enhance the phenomena presented here .",
