    "ngc  1275 ( also commonly known as perseus  a , 3c  84 , 4c+41.07 , or iras 03164 + 4119 ) is the central galaxy in the perseus cluster , abell  426 .",
    "the cluster abell  426 shows two distinct velocity components : ngc  1275 ( @xmath13 ) belongs to the low - velocity component , which is associated with velocities of 5200  .",
    "the high - velocity component , showing velocities of 8200  is located in front of ngc  1275 to the north and north - west of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the two velocity components have been interpreted as indicating an ongoing galaxy cluster merger @xcite .",
    "however , x - ray absorption studies by @xcite and @xcite indicate that the separation between both velocity components is large .",
    "@xcite suggest that the high - velocity system is not yet merging with ngc  1275 but is still in the process of falling into the cluster .",
    "the number of classifications for ngc  1275 in the literature  fanaroff - riley  1 radio galaxy ( f - r i ) , bl lac object , post - merger galaxy , cooling - flow galaxy , peculiar seyfert  1 , and liner  reflect the fact that ngc  1275 exhibits an extraordinarily rich set of interstellar physical phenomena .",
    "it is a star - forming early - type cd galaxy , harbouring an active nucleus which is a point source of hard x - rays @xcite and a very strong radio source ( hence the name perseus  a ) .",
    "the radio emission on large - scales and parsec - scales shows a pair of jets @xcite .",
    "the jets are oriented at a position angle of 160@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "using vlbi measurements of the parsec - scale jet , @xcite inferred a likely range of angles to the line of sight of @xmath15 .",
    "the southern jet is the one approaching us .",
    "ngc  1275 is associated with strong thermal x - ray emission , which extends over several arc minutes around the active nucleus and shows a complex bubble - like morphology @xcite , as well as with an extended structure of h@xmath16 filaments @xcite .",
    "these filaments of ionized gas have been studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "they are likely to be stabilized by magnetic fields @xcite and display liner - like spectra which have been analysed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined a variety of excitation mechanisms  including shocks , ionization by an agn , and stellar photoionization  without finding a fully adequate explanation for the observed spectra .",
    "collisional heating by ionizing particles has recently been investigated in greater detail as a possible explanation for the emission characteristics of the filaments @xcite .",
    "ngc  1275 was originally believed to represent the prototypical cooling - flow galaxy , in which the h@xmath16 filaments have formed by cooling of the intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "but the correlation between the x - ray and h@xmath16 morphology suggests that the filaments rather consist of cold gas which is uplifted behind the radio bubbles driven by the radio jet @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that there is also a tight correlation between the extended co line emission , the h@xmath16 filaments , the extended x - ray emission , and the large radio lobes mapped by @xcite .",
    "likewise , @xcite found a close correspondence between the h@xmath16 filaments and the extended h@xmath3 s(1 ) emission .",
    "a fraction of the molecular gas and much of the thermal x - ray emission are confined in shells around bubbles of non - thermal synchrotron - emitting plasma .",
    "this is clear evidence of the importance of the radio lobes in compressing and cooling the ambient galactic medium .",
    "this ambient galactic medium can be derived from either shock - cooled thermal x - ray plasma or from the debris of a recent galactic merger @xcite .",
    "the total mass of molecular gas in ngc  1275 is large .",
    "based on observations of the nuclear and extended gas , @xcite measured a total mass of cold h@xmath3 of @xmath17 , using the standard co to molecular hydrogen conversion factor . about @xmath18 of this molecular gas",
    "are contained in the inner @xmath19  kpc , a mass that is comparable with the total mass of h@xmath3 in the milky way .",
    "most of the emission arises in an extended east - west structure passing through the nucleus .",
    "@xcite found that the co emission in the central 8  kpc diameter region does not show any evidence of large - scale rotation .",
    "however , the co line profile in the central 4  kpc diameter region is double - peaked , which may indicate inflows , outflows , or a rotating disc @xcite .",
    "the source of the molecular hydrogen in the nuclear region of ngc  1275 is thought to be turbulent infalling gas . whether this gas is carried into the central regions by a galactic merger or a cooling flow",
    "is unclear ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "interferometric observations of the co emission in the central 10  kpc by @xcite revealed that most of the gas is associated with radial filaments , which are oriented in the east - west direction ( i.e. perpendicular to the jet axis ) , located between x - ray cavities , and consistent with radially infalling gas flows .",
    "@xcite argued that the absence of any large - scale rotation makes a merger - origin of the gas less likely .",
    "the near - infrared spectrum of the nuclear region was investigated by @xcite who found that the [ ] lines are unusually strong and narrow , indicating that they arise from a region with kinematics different from the nucleus .",
    "it was suggested that these features are caused by shocks .",
    "shocks were also suggested as the cause of the h@xmath3 s(1 ) line emission , first investigated by @xcite .",
    "these molecular shocks were discussed as possible triggers of starburst activity .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite determined the excitation temperatures of the near - infrared h@xmath3 lines in the circum - nuclear region .",
    "they found the emission of this @xmath20  k h@xmath3 component to be consistent with thermal excitation from x - ray or shock heating . because the brightest h@xmath3 emission is extended over only the central @xmath21300  pc ,",
    "@xcite concluded that it is more likely to be directly associated with the agn rather than being located in a large - scale cooling flow .",
    "@xcite agreed with this conclusion and further suggested that the h@xmath3 emission is too bright to be part of a cooling flow .",
    "in addition , their hst images show a faint extension of h@xmath3 s(1 ) emission from the nucleus to the southwest as well as a faint feature to the east of the nucleus .",
    "@xcite inferred the properties of the near - infrared h@xmath3 in the centre of ngc  1275 , using observations of the central @xmath22  arcsec@xmath1 with the imaging spectrograph uist ( ukirt imaging spectrometer ) on ukirt ( united kingdom infrared telescope ) taken under seeing - limited conditions of 0.30.4  arcsec .",
    "they suggested that the h@xmath3 emission at around 50  pc from the nucleus arises in a dense clumpy disc , rotating in a plane perpendicular to the radio jet .",
    "they concluded that thermal excitation by the nuclear radiation field is the dominant excitation mechanism of the h@xmath3 emission .",
    "based on the discontinuity in h@xmath3 velocity across the nucleus of around 240  km  s@xmath23 , they estimated a mass of @xmath24  m@xmath25 for the black hole at the nucleus , assuming a disc inclination of @xmath26 .",
    "the nuclear [ ]  1.644  emission was found to be spatially resolved , while the nuclear pa@xmath16 emission remained unresolved . according to @xcite , the nuclear disc of hot h@xmath3 would likely be part of the larger - scale h@xmath3 and co structure seen in ngc  1275 .",
    "this , together with the more recent observations of molecular gas in the extended filaments on several 10  kpc scales @xcite , suggests that the fuelling process of the agn in ngc  1275 by interstellar material is being observed over a large range of scales .    in this paper",
    ", we analyse the inner circum - nuclear disc of ngc  1275 using observations with nifs ( near - infrared integral - field spectrograph ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in conjunction with the adaptive - optics system , altair , on the gemini north telescope .",
    "the nifs data permit a high - spatial - resolution study of the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas via the h@xmath3 s(1 ) , [ ] 1.644 , 2.058 , and br@xmath5  2.166  lines as well as an examination of the excitation mechanisms of h@xmath3 and [ ] . throughout the paper we assume h@xmath27  km  s@xmath23  mpc@xmath23 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , which results in a spatial scale of 358  pc arcsec@xmath23 for ngc  1275 @xcite .",
    "the gemini near - infrared integral - field spectrograph ( nifs ) and altair adaptive - optics system on the 8.1  m gemini north telescope on mauna kea in hawaii were used to obtain @xmath30-band and @xmath31-band spectra of ngc  1275 .",
    "nifs has 29 slitlets , each 0.1  arcsec wide , and has a resolution of 0.04  arcsec per spaxel along each slitlet .",
    "the field of view is @xmath32  arcsec@xmath1 , and it delivers a spectral resolving power of @xmath21 5300 , matched to two pixels on the detector , at both @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this corresponds to a velocity resolution of @xmath21 60  km  s@xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath31-band observations of ngc  1275 were obtained on 2005 november 11 during the commissioning of nifs .",
    "the observations were performed using the altair natural guide star system with the nucleus of ngc  1275 as the reference for the adaptive - optics correction .",
    "the nearby star u1275_02199239 was used as the on - instrument wavefront sensor ( oiwfs ) guide star for slow flexure correction .",
    "the instrument was oriented at a position angle of @xmath33 , so that the slitlets were aligned e - w .",
    "the observation consisted of eight exposures of 600  s duration centred on ngc  1275 , interleaved with eight 600 s exposures of an adjacent sky region .",
    "none of these exposures was spatially dithered . the a0v hipparcos star hip  18769 was observed after the ngc  1275 observation to provide correction of telluric absorption and flux calibration from its 2mass magnitudes .",
    "the @xmath30-band observations of ngc  1275 were obtained during nifs science verification observations ( program gn-2006a - sv-124 ) on 2006 february 1 and 2 .",
    "again , altair was used in natural guide star mode and the instrument was set to a position angle of @xmath33 .",
    "two object - sky exposure pairs were obtained with 900  s exposure times in modest seeing , one pair on each night .",
    "hip  18769 was also observed after ngc  1275 on each night .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard way @xcite using a variant of the gemini iraf package .",
    "the object and sky exposures were combined first . then a dark exposure was subtracted from both the combined - object and combined - sky frames .",
    "the combined - sky frame was scaled to match the combined - object frame and subtracted .",
    "the sky - subtracted object frame was then flatfielded , bad pixels were interpolated , and the 29 individual two - dimensional slitlet spectra were extracted from this image .",
    "argon arc spectra were used to define the wavelength calibration and flatfield exposures through a ronchi grating were used to define the spatial calibration along slitlets .",
    "each two - dimensional slitlet spectrum was then geometrically transformed onto a rectilinear spatio - spectral coordinate grid and the resulting 29 two - dimensional spectra combined into a three - dimensional data cube .",
    "a one - dimensional spectrum was extracted from a 0.5  arcsec - diameter circular aperture defined within the standard star data cube , a correction for telluric absorption was defined , and this one - dimensional correction spectrum was applied to all spaxels within the object and standard star data cubes .",
    "similarly , a flux - calibration spectrum was extracted from the telluric - corrected standard star data cube using a 1.5  arcsec - diameter circular aperture with the level set by the 2mass @xmath30 or @xmath31 band magnitude and the blackbody shape defined by its 2mass @xmath34 colour temperature of 11000 k. the final data cubes obtained at @xmath30 and @xmath31 are in the form of multi - extension fits files with 2040 wavelength pixels and @xmath35 spatial pixels ( spaxels ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath30- and @xmath31-band spectra of the core of ngc 1275 , integrated over a 1.0  arcsec - diameter circular aperture , are shown in figs  [ f : hsp ] and [ f : ksp ] .",
    "the @xmath31-band spectrum of the core of ngc  1275 is known to be dominated by h@xmath3 emission lines @xcite .",
    "our spectra confirm a large number of h@xmath3 lines , mostly in the @xmath31-band spectrum and some weaker lines in the @xmath30-band spectrum .",

    "in agreement with the morphological evidence for a circum - nuclear disc from section  [ s : morphology ] and the previous indications for a rotating disc based on the lower - resolution data by @xcite , the h@xmath3 s(1 )  2.122  and [ ]  1.644  emission lines show kinematics indicative of disc rotation in the central @xmath140  arcsec ( @xmath141  pc ) of ngc  1275 .",

    "in addition to the stellar mass , the molecular gas mass is likely to contribute significantly to the total mass in the centre of ngc  1275 .",

    "according to our nifs data , of the order of 1 per cent of this flux originate from the central @xmath230  pc . assuming that this flux ratio translates into a mass ratio and that the same ratio applies to the near- , mid - infrared , and cold molecular gas , we estimate the cold molecular gas mass in the central @xmath230  pc to be about 1 per cent of the total cold molecular gas mass of the ngc  1275 nebula ( @xmath17 , * ? ? ?",
    "this results in a cold molecular gas mass of @xmath231 , which is about two orders of magnitude larger than the stellar mass estimate for the same region .",

    "these molecular hydrogen emission galaxies ( mohegs ) are found among radio galaxies of both fanaroff ",
    "riley classes and among cool core clusters .",

    "the same mechanism is suggested for ngc  1275 , based on the nifs data discussed in this paper ( section  [ s : res : h2exc ] ) .",
    "this raises the question whether these shocks originate from radio - jet feedback , as suggested for the overall sample of radio mohegs by @xcite , or from gas accretion , as discussed for the molecular disc in ngc  1275 in section  [ s : accretion ] . in the feedback scenario ,",
    "shocks are driven into dense clouds in a porous interstellar medium by the hot cocoon powered by the radio jet , as for example shown in the simulations by @xcite and @xcite . in the accretion scenario , gas clumps are repeatedly shocked while falling into the centre of the galaxy so that gravitational potential energy is converted into shocks and turbulent heating . in a case study of 3c  326",
    "n , a @xmath265 radio moheg with a very low star - formation rate and an x - ray faint agn , @xcite suggest a tidally - induced accretion flow as the most likely origin of the shocks , while @xcite favour the jet feedback scenario .",

    "for the accretion process , we estimate an accretion luminosity of the order of @xmath268 , which is about one order of magnitude larger than the warm h@xmath3 luminosity .",
    "this accretion luminosity is derived by dividing the potential energy of the infalling gas of about @xmath269 by the dynamical free - fall time of @xmath270  yrs , in analogy to @xcite . for this calculation",
    "we assume that the total cold gas mass of @xmath17 @xcite falls back from an average distance of 30  kpc into the potential well corresponding to a stellar mass of @xmath271 .",
    "this stellar mass is derived from the @xmath272-@xmath273 relations at @xmath274 by @xcite , using the @xmath275 from section  [ s : model ] as the black - hole mass .    as neither jet feedback nor gas accretion stands out as the dominant energy source in ngc  1275 ,",
    "it is likely that the observed properties of gas excitation and kinematics are a consequence of both processes .",
    "rotating molecular discs , as found in the circum - nuclear region of ngc  1275 , or on scales of 3  kpc in 3c  326  n @xcite , suggest that accretion processes play a role . since the radio jet can not impart angular momentum on a gaseous disc , disc rotation is a sign of gas infall .",
    "this gas inflow may be associated with tidal galaxy - galaxy interactions , or with accretion from the halo .",
    "these processes have been discussed for the case of 3c  326  n @xcite . for ngc  1275 ,",
    "it is most likely that the gas inflows consist of gas which falls back from the radio jet bubbles @xcite .",
    "such back flows of gas uplifted during the active jet phase are also seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "tidally - induced gas inflows could result from an interaction with the high - velocity system .",
    "but this scenario is less likely , since the high - velocity system is still at a large distance from ngc  1275 @xcite .",

    "broad h@xmath3 lines are also characteristic of the sample of radio galaxies with fast ionized / atomic outflows , studied by @xcite .",
    "integrated over the full field - of - view , our nifs data of ngc  1275 show an h@xmath3 s(1 ) line width of fwhm  @xmath277 , which is comparable to the above values .",
    "a fraction of this line width is likely to be attributed to ordered streaming motions , which are characterized by small ( @xmath278 ) and largely positive velocities ( see fig .",
    "[ f : h2vel ] ) . since the models for the circum - nuclear disc in ngc  1275 ( section  [ s : model ] )",

    "( the total widths of the h@xmath3 lines in the small - aperture spectra , listed in table  [ t : flux ] , are much larger than that , but are dominated by the disc rotation . )",
    "the fact that the dispersion - related line width in the disc is smaller than the total integrated line width in the nifs field - of - view suggests that the accretion flow is energetically capable of producing the turbulent motions in the disc .",
    "alternatively , the turbulence may be driven by the radio jet and its hot cocoon .",
    "turbulent heating via radio jet feedback can affect a large volume if the gas is distributed in the form of clumps in a porous interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "turbulent heating of the molecular gas component by the jet interaction is only compatible with the observed disc configurations if the jet is , at the same time , inefficient in expelling the molecular gas from the disc . such a picture",
    "is also suggested by the observations by @xcite , who find that in radio galaxies with fast ionized and atomic outflows the bulk of the mid - infrared h@xmath3 emission does not participate in the outflow , despite showing signs of turbulent heating .",
    "simulations by @xcite , which probe the effects of a jet interaction with an almost keplerian and turbulently supported disc of a warm clumpy interstellar medium in an elliptical galaxy , show that the jet interaction is , indeed , inefficient in driving the gas out of the disc region .",
    "however , there is a significant gas transport from the inner to the outer portions of the disc , which will eventually leave the inner portions depleted . if the disc is porous , the mass transfer rates are lower than in the case of a homogeneous disc of gas",
    ".    we estimate the porosity of the circum - nuclear disc in ngc  1275 by comparing the observed mean density of h@xmath3 molecules in the central @xmath2  pc with the density expected for the corresponding gas component from the ideal equation of state .",
    "as shown in section  [ s : accretion ] , we tentatively estimate the total molecular gas mass within a radius of @xmath2  pc to be @xmath231 .",
    "the corresponding mean number density of molecules in the central volume is @xmath280 , where @xmath281 is the proton mass and @xmath282 is approximated by the spherical volume enclosed by a radius of 50  pc .",
    "this value is similar to the clump density derived from the ideal equation of state , if we assume that the clumps are composed of cold molecular gas at a mean temperature of @xmath283  k and that they are in pressure equilibrium with the hot ism pressure of @xmath284 , following the scenario by @xcite .",
    "the similarity between the mean observed density and the estimated clump density from the ideal equation of state suggests that the cold molecular gas , if distributed in clumps , is likely to have a high filling factor .",
    "an independent measure of the actual gas density is provided by detection experiments for high - density gas tracers .",
    "@xcite report the detection of hcn(3 - 2 ) in the centre of ngc  1275 , which indicates a gas density of at least @xmath285 .",
    "this value agrees with the mean gas density estimated above .",
    "but , as a lower limit for the actual gas density , it does not rule out the possibility of smaller filling factors",
    ". detections of other high - density gas tracers are needed in order to obtain a better estimate of the filling factor .",
    "the relative importance of accretion and jet feedback in exciting and heating the molecular gas in ngc  1275 and other radio mohegs is poorly constrained with the current data . improved observational parameters for the molecular gas phase ",
    "e.g. , from alma observations of high - density tracers  together with refined simulations are required in order to explore the effects of the jet interaction with the interstellar medium in these molecular - hydrogen - rich radio galaxies .",
    "the paper is based on near - infrared integral field spectroscopy of ngc  1275 , obtained with the nifs instrument at gemini north at a spatial resolution of @xmath286  arcsec .",
    "we have presented a scenario in which the shock - excited molecular hydrogen , traced via the near - infrared ro - vibrational h@xmath3 lines , enters into the circum - nuclear region in the form of one or more streamers and settles into a turbulent , clumpy or unstable accretion disc close to the nucleus , where energy dissipation via turbulence and shocks drives the further accretion process towards the core .",

    "it is suggested that both the  2.058  and br@xmath5 emission lines arise at least partially from the inner parts of the disc , because they display a larger central velocity dispersion than the h@xmath3 s(1 ) line .",
