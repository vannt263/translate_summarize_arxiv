    "it is well known that nonlinear theories manifest a variety of classical configurations such as solitons and instantons and dynamical effects such as symmetry breaking , confinement and phase transitions , which can never be seen using an ordinary perturbative expansion .",
    "such exact classical configurations can provide us with powerful insight into the nonperturbative content of those theories and may exhibit novel emergent particle - like behavior .",
    "classical configurations such as solitons are commonly observed solutions of nonlinear relativistic or non - relativistic equations . they are localized , finite energy solutions , which can travel while retaining their shape .",
    "these classical configurations also strongly determine the structure of the corresponding quantized theories .",
    "for example , the hilbert space of the well - known one - dimensional @xmath0 and sine - gordon field theory models are classified to topologically inequivalent sectors , which can not be obtained by power expansion of the global vacuum state .",
    "however , these sectors can be obtained by quantizing a field around the nontrivial backgrounds of either the @xmath0 kinks or sine - gordon solitons @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether nonperturbative effects , such as collective particle - like behavior , are manifested in the entanglement structure of nonlinear theories .",
    "much of the recent study of entanglement in multipartite systems has been carried out in linear systems such as harmonic and spin chains @xcite . in such one - dimensional system",
    "it has been found that entanglement is a measure of criticality and manifests a universal scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "the behavior of entanglement in nonlinear systems may challenge some of the insights from the linear systems , and shed new light regarding the nature of entanglement .",
    "the study of entanglement in nonlinear systems may also suggest new implementations of quantum information processes .    in this work",
    "we investigate entanglement in a chain of nearest neighbors interacting oscillators subjected to a periodic on - site external potential , known as the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model @xcite .",
    "this model possesses rich behavior and so we parameterize it from two aspects : its weak / strong - coupling regime and critical / noncritical regime .",
    "the continuum - limit solutions of the fk model are the well - known sine - gordon solitons .",
    "although we deal with a finite discrete system , it still retains most of the characteristics of the continuum and therefore in the following we shall use the same field - theory terminology ( vacuum - sector , soliton - sector , etc . ) .    roughly speaking",
    ", one can say that a soliton solution is one in which the effective @xmath1 of the quantum free - field around the classical background decreases inside the core of the soliton and even becomes negative . outside the soliton the field behaves as a regular massive free theory .",
    "therefore , the field interpolates critical - like behavior inside the soliton s core and noncritical behavior outside the core .",
    "it can be expected , therefore , that the von - neumann entropy of a region which coincides with the soliton will manifest a mixture of critical and noncritical behaviors , depending on its size .",
    "this is the first result we provide .",
    "we compute the entanglement in the single - soliton sector ground state .",
    "we find that as long as the block is confined to the soliton s core , entanglement increases logarithmically but faster than the critical harmonic systems .",
    "however , as we keep increasing the size of the block so that it grows outside the soliton s kink , the entanglement decreases and saturates the asymptotic constant limit that corresponds to the noncritical massive system .",
    "therefore , the soliton manifests a particle - like localization of entanglement .",
    "next we study long - range effects of entanglement , that is the entanglement between two spatially separated blocks , and use the logarithmic negativity as a measure of entanglement .",
    "we find that the entanglement distribution is peaked around the location of the solitons .",
    "we then study soliton - soliton entanglement as a function of their separation and compare the results with the corresponding behavior in the vacuum sector .",
    "the latter is also equivalent to the ground state of a linear harmonic chain with mass @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the coupling strength .",
    "in the two - soliton sector we see complex behavior of long - range entanglement .",
    "we find that the entanglement between two solitons is larger than the corresponding entanglement in the vacuum sector .",
    "for relatively small separations of the solitons the entanglement decays with the separation more slowly than that of the critical vacuum sector .",
    "moreover , in the noncritical limit entanglement loses one of its most fundamental properties : it is no longer a monotonically decreasing function of the distance between the solitons !",
    "much of our discussion is devoted to the strong - coupling limit . in the weak - coupling limit , where the kinks become impurities that are confined to a few particles",
    ", we find that the entanglement loses both its localization and long - range effects .    finally , we suggest and investigate the possible use of solitons as carriers of quantum information .",
    "we propose utilizing the internal localized modes , which describe collective and vibrational perturbations of the classical soliton , as the carriers of quantum information .",
    "the soliton is handled as a non - perturbative classical object while the internal modes are quantized linear perturbations `` around '' it .",
    "since the internal modes are `` attached '' to the soliton , by moving the soliton , quantum information can be transported in the system .",
    "( transportation of quantum information has been discussed for harmonic chains @xcite , spin chains @xcite and josephson arrays @xcite ) .",
    "we also formulate multi - soliton processes , which generate entanglement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the fk model and analyze its strong / weak - coupling and critical / noncritical limits .",
    "then in section @xmath4 we investigate localization of entanglement in the continuum limit of the fk model . in section",
    "@xmath5 we present the soliton - soliton long - range entanglement . in section",
    "@xmath6 we briefly discuss the loss of both long - range effects and localization in the weak - coupling limit . in section",
    "@xmath7 we discuss possible quantum information implementations .",
    "lastly , in section @xmath8 we summarize the significant results and outline future directions of research .",
    "we consider @xmath9 particles with canonical coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 , described by the hamiltonian of the fk model @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath10 is the displacement of the @xmath13th particle from its equilibrium position , @xmath3 is the coupling constant between particles in the chain and @xmath14 we use dimensionless units in which the particles mass equals @xmath15 and the period and amplitude of the substrate potential @xmath16 are @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . in the ground state of the system",
    "all particles occupy minima of the potential such that @xmath19 or @xmath20 , etc .",
    "then the simplest excited state is a soliton that connects two neighboring ground state solutions as illustrated in figure [ fig0 ] .",
    "the exact solutions of the discrete fk chain are not known in an explicit analytical form due to the discreteness of the problem . however , in the strong coupling limit , @xmath21 , an approximate discrete solution can be obtained using the _ continuum limit approximation _ , @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite . in this framework",
    "we begin with the sine - gordon hamiltonian density @xmath24 where a dot or a prime represents differentiation with respect to time or space respectively .",
    "the equation of motion is then the integrable sine - gordon ( sg ) equation : @xmath25    imposing the boundary conditions @xmath26 and rescaling @xmath27 , we obtain the sg soliton solution : @xmath28 where @xmath29 defines the soliton s width in units of the period of the substrate potential , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the coordinate of the soliton s center . for @xmath32",
    "the continuum limit is a reasonable approximation .",
    "we can then describe our @xmath9-particle system using the continuum solution by sampling @xmath33 at @xmath9 points with separation @xmath15 , where @xmath31 is sampled at the middle . throughout the paper we shall refer to this sampled classical solution ( eq . [ sgkink ] ) simply as the soliton solution ( for @xmath34 ) . note that as we increase @xmath3 , even though the separation between particles is kept constant , the number of particles ( points ) that sample the core of the soliton , @xmath29 , increases .    in order to investigate long - range entanglement between solitons , we are interested in exploring double - soliton solutions as well .",
    "there are no multi - soliton static solutions in infinite systems .",
    "however , the finite sine - gordon equation also possesses multi - soliton static solutions ( eq . [ sg ] ) .",
    "this equation describes the magnetic flux in a long josephson junction of length @xmath35 with a constant homogeneous external magnetic field @xmath36 , perpendicular to the barrier and with bias current line density @xmath37 .",
    "we use these double - soliton solutions , @xmath38 , as the continuum limit approximation of the of fk model in a finite system . in appendix",
    "a we describe the analytical solutions of the double - soliton solutions . for illustration purposes",
    ", we present in figure [ fig1 ] single soliton and double - soliton configurations .",
    "more details are provided in appendix a.    in the weak - coupling limit of the fk model ( @xmath39 ) there are no known analytical solutions .",
    "still , in this regime there are kink solutions , @xmath40 , which are localized to a small number of particles .",
    "these kink solutions can be found numerically .",
    "we use a descending gradient algorithm that minimizes the classical configuration energy , given an initial solution to start with .",
    "apparently , in the weak - coupling limit , where @xmath3 is small ( @xmath41 ) the analytical continuum term is still a good enough starter for the minimizer to find the minimal stable configuration .      in order to explore quantum mechanical effects in solitons we use a semi - classical framework . for simplicity , we provide the analysis on the continuous solutions .",
    "we consider small perturbations @xmath42 on the background of the classical solution @xmath43 ( single soliton , double - soliton or kink ) : @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the potential energy and @xmath47 is the kinetic energy , we assume the solutions are static , @xmath48 .",
    "then we can make a functional taylor expansion of the potential energy @xmath49\\ ] ] about @xmath50 : @xmath51\\!\\eta(x)\\!\\big\\},\\ ] ] where cubic and higher terms in @xmath52 are neglected .",
    "this requires that the magnitude of @xmath53 as well as the third and higher derivatives of @xmath54 at @xmath50 be small .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath55 evaluated at @xmath56 are then the generalized solutions of the schrodinger - like equation @xmath57\\eta_l(x)=\\omega_l^2\\eta_l(x),\\ ] ] where the @xmath58 are the orthonormal normal - modes of the fluctuations around @xmath43 . in the continuous solution",
    "@xmath59 is a continuous index with possible additional discrete values .    translating the above analysis to the discrete system we obtain a set of equations ,",
    "that is , the @xmath60 and @xmath61 are obtained by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "we require that @xmath64 ; otherwise the system is in a nonstable configuration .",
    "we obtain the quantum - mechanical modes of the system by setting : @xmath65 and quantizing the normal - mode coefficients @xmath66 .",
    "the canonical degrees of freedom are then : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are annihilation and creation operators of the normal modes , and @xmath70 where @xmath71 , is the excitation number of the @xmath59th normal mode .",
    "the background classical solution @xmath50 could either be an absolute minimum or a local minimum of @xmath72 . consider first the case that @xmath50 is an absolute minimum .",
    "then all particles are located at their equilibrium positions and the solution does not contain kinks or solitons .",
    "the normals modes are then identical with the `` phonon modes '' of a harmonic chain : @xmath73 and the spectrum is given by @xcite : @xmath74    upon quantization , the quantum states of the fk system in the absolute minimum case , which we also refer to as the `` vacuum sector '' , coincide with that of a harmonic chain . hence , in the continuum limit the vacuum sector of the fk model corresponds to a free massive scalar field with @xmath75 .",
    "and the ground state has the same properties of the corresponding free field vacuum state .",
    "if @xmath50 is a local minimum , then the solution contains solitons ( or kinks ) . in the continuum limit",
    "the eigenvalue equation is @xmath76\\eta_l(x)=\\omega_l^2 \\eta_l(x).\\ ] ] in the limit of an infinite system the translational invariance of the system gives rise to a zero frequency mode ( goldstone mode , or `` zero mode '' ) , which requires special attention .",
    "this problem is avoided in our case due to discreteness and finiteness of the system .",
    "nevertheless , in correspondence with the infinite limit , the zero mode is still characterized by a localized shape of a bound state and will be referred to as an _",
    "internal mode_. ( in other nonlinear models which have soliton solutions such as the @xmath0 model , there can be additional internal localized modes which are not zero modes . )    for clarification , we present several normal modes and their eigenfrequencies for the solutions presented in figure [ fig1 ] . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "the first @xmath5 normal modes and the @xmath77th normal mode of the single - soliton solution are shown , where the first @xmath5 eigenfrequencies are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , given in dimensionless units .",
    "note that the first eigenvalue is less than @xmath15 and corresponds to the internal mode , while all the others are phonon modes . in figure [ fig3 ] ,",
    "the first @xmath5 normal modes and the @xmath77th normal mode of the double - soliton solution are shown , where the first @xmath6 eigenfrequencies are @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 . here",
    "the first two normal modes are internal modes .",
    "as we shall see , it is the presence of the internal modes which gives rise to qualitatively different behavior of the quantum mechanical states in the solitonic sector , such as particle - like behavior and localization of entanglement .",
    "we would like to compare the behavior of correlations in the ground states of the vacuum and soliton sectors in the strong and weak coupling regimes .",
    "let us define the correlation lengths @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath13 is the ( integer ) distance between the particles .",
    "we begin with the strong - coupling regime . in the vacuum sector",
    "the correlation lengths @xmath89 have been thoroughly analyzed in connection with the harmonic chain @xcite .",
    "these correlations are classified by the critical and noncritical regimes . in the critical limit",
    "there are long - range correlations as there is no length scale in the system ( @xmath90 ) . in this limit",
    "the correlations scale as : @xmath91 in a system with @xmath9 particles and a coupling strength @xmath3 the critical regime is valid if @xmath92 .",
    "the noncritical regime is characterized by a finite length scale . here the correlations decay exponentially with the distance : @xmath93 the noncritical regime is defined for @xmath94 . for @xmath95 @xcite , for example , the system is critical for @xmath96 , and noncritical for @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "we turn now to the soliton sector . for the critical limit",
    "the number of particles in the core of the soliton should be greater than the number of particles in the whole chain : @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , in the critical limit the vacuum sector and the soliton sector coincide : for a constant @xmath9 taking @xmath3 to infinity causes the loss of the internal mode , which now enters into the phonon band .",
    "we define @xmath99 as the maximal coupling constant for which there is a discrete internal mode . for @xmath100",
    "no difference is predicted between the ground states of the vacuum and soliton sectors since their spectra and normal modes become practically identical .",
    "on the other hand , in the weak - coupling limit , @xmath39 , the correlations decay very fast and again one may expect no significant difference between the vacuum sector and the kink sector .",
    "therefore , we expect qualitative difference between the vacuum sector and the soliton sector only in the noncritical , strong coupling regime .    in figure [ xx_cor ]",
    "we show on log - log scale @xmath101 for @xmath95 , where @xmath102 .",
    "the plots are given for the vacuum sector and the soliton / kink sector of the fk model , where the center of the soliton / kink is located at @xmath103 .",
    "we study the following coupling constants : @xmath104 ( critical limit ) , @xmath105 ( noncritical regime ) and @xmath106 ( weak - coupling limit ) .",
    "first of all , we observe that the vacuum and soliton / kink sectors are indeed undistinguishable both in the critical limit and the weak - coupling limit . in the noncritical regime",
    ", however , @xmath107 is qualitatively different from @xmath108 . inside the soliton s core ( @xmath109 )",
    ", @xmath107 decays more slowly than @xmath108 and even @xmath110 .",
    "as @xmath13 becomes greater than @xmath29 , however , we see a strong decay in @xmath107 , which quickly becomes parallel to the graph of @xmath108 in the noncritical regime .",
    "we explain this behavior on physical grounds by relating to the effective @xmath1 of the linearized free - field around the critical vacuum and the ( noncritical ) soliton sector : @xmath111 as @xmath1 become negative for @xmath112 the correlation length inside the core decays more slowly than that of the critical vacuum sector . outside the core",
    "the correlation restores the massive vacuum sector behavior .",
    "we expect that the entanglement of solitons will have a similar behavior to the correlation length .",
    "we turn now to the entanglement of the fk model in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "both in the vacuum sector and in the soliton sector we assume the normal modes are in their ground states , therefore the quantum - mechanical states are gaussian . following @xcite , let us represent the local canonical variables of our n - mode system ( eq .",
    "[ fields ] ) by the vector @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the commutation relations may thus be expressed as @xmath116=ij_{\\alpha\\beta},\\ ] ] where j is the so - called symplectic matrix : @xmath117 assuming @xmath118 , the state of the system is entirely characterized by the matrix of the second moments , the so - called phase - space @xmath119 covariance matrix ( cm ) : @xmath120 under a symplectic transformation @xmath121 a gaussian state @xmath122 is mapped into a gaussian state @xmath123 , where @xmath124 . a theorem due to williamson @xcite states that there always exists a certain symplectic transformation @xmath125 that brings @xmath122 to the normal form ( `` williamson form '' ) : @xmath126 where the diagonal elements @xmath127 are referred as the symplectic eigenvalues and must be greater or equal to @xmath128 according to the uncertainty principle .    now",
    ", suppose our pure @xmath9-mode system ( eq . [ fields ] ) is partitioned into two sets @xmath129 and @xmath130 . in order to measure the entanglement between parts @xmath131 and @xmath132 we bring the reduced covariance matrices @xmath133 and @xmath134 into their williamson normal forms .",
    "both @xmath133 and @xmath134 have the same @xmath135 symplectic eigenvalues .",
    "the entanglement is then measured by the von - neumann entropy @xmath136 : @xmath137 where @xmath138 since the @xmath139 correlations vanish in our model , @xmath140 are given by the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath141 ( or @xmath142 ) @xcite , where @xmath143      in figure [ vn_scale ] we plot the von - neumann entropy of a block of @xmath59 particles in the chain where in the soliton sector the center of the soliton coincide with the center of the block .",
    "the plots are given for both the vacuum sector and the soliton sector ( in the strong - coupling regime of the fk model ) .",
    "the plots are given for two regimes : critical ( @xmath144 ) , in which case both sectors have the same behavior and noncritical ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "first of all , let us examine the behavior in the vacuum sector .",
    "in the critical regime the entanglement increases as the size of the block increases .",
    "this effects stops , however , due to the finiteness of the chain ( due to edge effects this happens long before @xmath145 ) . in the noncritical regime",
    "the entanglement increases for a finite region and then saturates a constant value .    in figure [ vn_scale_2 ]",
    "the same graph is plotted on logarithmic scale for @xmath146 .",
    "we see that the critical vacuum sector fits the linear curve for @xmath147 , where the noncritical vacuum sector fits the linear curve for @xmath148 .    in the soliton sector",
    "we observe in figure [ vn_scale ] qualitatively different behavior , as anticipated from the discussion on the correlation length in the previous section .",
    "the von - neumann entropy of the soliton _ mixes both the critical and noncritical scalings _ : it scales logarithmically inside the soliton , that is for @xmath149 , and then it decreases to the noncritical vacuum sector asymptotic value .",
    "as seen in figure [ vn_scale_2 ] , inside the soliton the logarithmic increase of the soliton sector is faster than the corresponding vacuum sector .",
    "this characteristic behavior implies that the entropy in the soliton sector must have a maximal value .",
    "in contrast to the vacuum sector , the entanglement in the soliton sector is localized as it reaches a maximal value at a certain length scale corresponding to the size of the soliton .",
    "note that the logarithmic increase of the entanglement inside the core of the soliton is even faster than that of the _ critical _ vacuum sector .",
    "this result corresponds to the effective negative @xmath1 inside the core .    for reference",
    "we plot in figure [ vn_scale_3 ] the von - neumann entropy of the soliton sector for @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "we may say that entanglement localization `` measures '' the size of the soliton , as maximal entanglement is achieved for @xmath153 in all three cases .",
    "we can see that as the system enters deep into the noncritical regime ( @xmath151 , @xmath154 ) the entanglement becomes more localized and reaches a higher maximum .",
    "we would like now to obtain the prefactor @xmath155 in the logarithmic scaling @xmath156 for small enough values of @xmath59 , @xmath157 , in the vacuum sector and the soliton sector . as a first order for the linear curve we take the first two points in the graph : @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "for @xmath160 both models have approximately the well - known universal factor of @xmath161 in critical bosonic one - dimensional fields . in figure [ vn_max_g ]",
    "we plot @xmath155 for @xmath162 , where @xmath3 is given in a @xmath163 scale .",
    "we observe that as @xmath3 gets closer to @xmath9 the initial logarithmic jump of the entanglement becomes sharper .",
    "this is explained from the following conditions : @xmath164 therefore , as @xmath3 decreases @xmath165 falls more rapidly outside the core and the initial logarithmic jump of the entanglement becomes sharper .",
    "this effect stops , however , for @xmath166 , as then already for @xmath167 , the entanglement is close to its maximal value .",
    "as anticipated from the correlations behavior , for any value of @xmath3 in the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath34 ) , the logarithmic increase is even faster than the corresponding one in the critical vacuum sector : @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is obtained for @xmath170 .",
    "maximal localized entanglement is achieved in the soliton sector for lower values of the coupling constant @xmath3 ( yet not too low , so that the strong - coupling limit still holds ) .",
    "we show that the maximal value of the entanglement is determined by the frequency of the internal model . in figure",
    "[ maximal_ent ] the maximal localized von neumann entropy as a function of @xmath3 is shown , where for reference , we plot on the same graph @xmath171 , so that both plots appear with the same scale .",
    "clearly , @xmath172 is minimal exactly where the von - neumann entropy reaches its maximal value ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "in passing we note that as @xmath3 gets closer to the critical limit , @xmath172 increases and eventually penetrates the phonon band and stops behaving as a bound state .",
    "in addition , @xmath172 increases as discreteness increases ( @xmath3 decreases ) .",
    "this is associated with the existence of a potential barrier in a discrete lattice that must be overcome to move the soliton along one lattice spacing , and is known as peierls - nabarro potential @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath172 has an oscillatory behavior for @xmath173 .",
    "oscillations of @xmath174 are known for models that deviate from the fk sinusoidal potential @xcite . here",
    "we observe the oscillations in the fk model for large values of @xmath3 , where @xmath172 starts to increase .",
    "we now explore long - range effects of entanglement in the fk model .",
    "we are interested in the entanglement between two separated blocks of particles @xmath131 and @xmath132 with the same number of particles @xmath59 , separated by @xmath175 particles .",
    "now @xmath176 does not constitute a pure - state and the von - neumann entropy can not be used anymore .",
    "we therefore use a mixed - state entanglement measure  the logarithmic negativity ( ln ) @xcite .",
    "this measure is based on the following observation : when the parts are entangled , reversing time direction in one part of the system : @xmath177 , breaks the symplectic symmetry of their covariance matrix , yielding @xmath178 , which violates the uncertainty principle .",
    "the amount by which @xmath178 is a measure of the entanglement : @xmath179      in the double - soliton sector of the fk model we explore long - range entanglement between two solitons , which are characterized by the length scale @xmath180 .",
    "we obtain different values of the distance between the solitons , @xmath181 , by choosing appropriate values for @xmath36 ( and hence @xmath182 ) as described in appendix a.    we first show that the most significant contribution to long - range entanglement originates from the solitons . consider a certain double - soliton configuration with solitons size @xmath183 and separation @xmath181 .",
    "now let us take two blocks with the same size and separation : @xmath184 , @xmath185 and slide them along the chain .",
    "we expect that as the blocks positions become identical to the solitons positions we will get the maximal value of ln . in figure [ sliding ] we present @xmath186 of two such sliding blocks , where @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "the positions of the solitons are shown for reference .",
    "the @xmath190 coordinate in the graph @xmath13 is the average of the centers of the two blocks @xmath131 and @xmath132 . since the double - soliton solution is symmetric ,",
    "the centers of the blocks coincide with the locations of the solitons for @xmath103 . indeed , the entanglement is maximal at that point .",
    "in addition to the main maximum , there are secondary maxima at @xmath191 , which are obtained when @xmath13 coincide with the center of the solitons .",
    "these maxima correspond to the entanglement between the right and left tails of each of the solitons .",
    "we note that in the vacuum sector two such sliding blocks yield practically constant value of long - range entanglement .",
    "the fact that long - range entanglement has its peak at the core of the solitons is also manifested in the structure of the williamson s modes , the so - called participation functions @xcite,@xcite : @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the participation functions qualitatively describe the distribution of entanglement between two complementary regions .",
    "we split the chain into two equal - sized blocks . in the vacuum sector",
    "the participation functions are practically `` localized '' @xcite .",
    "@xmath195 , which has the highest contribution to the entanglement , originates at the boundary between the parts .",
    "the contribution of the other modes ( @xmath196 ) decreases exponentially .",
    "the localization of @xmath197 departs from the boundary as @xmath198 increases . in contrast , in the double - soliton solution , the participation functions are not localized and correspond to the entanglement between the solitons . in figure [ partic2 ] we present @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath195 and @xmath201 in logarithmic scale , where @xmath202 ( the first internal mode ) is also plotted for reference .",
    "in contrast to the participation functions in the vacuum sector , the participation functions in the solitons sector peak at the core of the solitons .",
    "we now look at scaling of long - range entanglement as a function of the separation between the solitons .",
    "we compare long - range soliton - soliton entanglement to the corresponding entanglement in the vacuum sector , which is equivalent to long - range entanglement in the linear harmonic chain . in the _ critical _ vacuum sector",
    "the scaling of the ln for sufficiently large chains is universal and depends on a single parameter @xmath203 . for sufficiently large values of @xmath204 ,",
    "the logarithmic negativity scales as @xmath205 , where @xmath206 @xcite is the universal decay coefficient of the critical chain . in the noncritical chain",

    "for relatively small values of @xmath212 a linear curve approximation of @xmath215 yields @xmath216 , which is even stronger than the universal scaling of the critical vacuum sector @xcite . in this regime",
    "the solitons have a large overlap , corresponding to the negative square mass in the region of the solitons . as @xmath212 increases the linear curve does not fit and has a somewhat oscillating behavior .",
    "for large values of @xmath212 we see that the decay of the entanglement is larger than the corresponding one in the vacuum sector .    for the smaller value of the coupling constant , @xmath217 , we observe even more surprising behavior .",
    "the ln _ oscillates _ around a somewhat constant value for @xmath218 . in this regime long - range entanglement",
    "loses one of its most fundamental characteristics : it is _ no longer _ a monotonically decreasing function of the distance between the solitons !",
    "we would like to analyze the unique behavior of the long - range entanglement in the soliton sector .",
    "we discuss two factors , each of which dominates in a different regime of the coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "for relatively large coupling , @xmath219 , the particle - like behavior of the solitons is the dominant factor .",
    "for relatively low coupling , @xmath220 , it is the topological nature of the first internal mode that dictates the entanglement behavior .",
    "let us first discuss the particle - like behavior of the solitons by considering a toy - model . from figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we see that the first two internal modes : @xmath202 , @xmath221 are localized to the solitons and describe qualitatively two groups of oscillating particles inside each of the solitons .",
    "@xmath202 and @xmath221 are symmetric / antisymmetric and describes correlated / anticorrelated oscillations of the two groups respectively .",
    "therefore , we simplify our model to two coupled harmonic oscillators with normal - mode eigenfrequencies @xmath172 and @xmath222 , which we identify with the internal modes eigenfrequencies in the solitons sector",
    ". then it can be easily shown that the entanglement between the oscillators depends on a single symplectic eigenvalue @xmath223 where @xmath224 .",
    "correspondingly , the entanglement between the solitons depends mainly on the ratio between the two internal modes eigenfrequencies .    in figure [ particle_like ]",
    "we show the particle - like behavior of the two solitons for @xmath105 .",
    "first note that both @xmath225 and @xmath226 are not monotonic functions .",
    "each has a certain global minimum , which appears due to the finiteness of the system .",
    "as the gap between the eigenfrequencies is closed ( @xmath227 ) , the entanglement decreases significantly .",
    "moreover , the slight deviations from the curve appear when there are also deviations in the gap , as indicated by the vertical arrows .",
    "for reference , we present the entanglement of our toy mode @xmath228 .",
    "clearly , the toy - model manifests much larger entanglement since the phonon band is not included , and therefore its decohering screening effect is missing .    this model can be used to obtain a lower bound for the decay coefficient @xmath229 in the limit where @xmath208 . in this limit",
    "we can use a double - well wkb approximation to estimate the eigenfrequencies : @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the classical momentum , which is approximately @xmath232 . in this case",
    "the entanglement can be approximated for @xmath208 as @xmath233 .",
    "therefore , we obtain a lower bound for @xmath229 in the soliton sector , @xmath234 .",
    "we expect that this bound is valid for large values of @xmath3 , where the particle - like behavior of the solitons is the most significant effect , and for large values of @xmath212 so that the solitons have a small overlap .",
    "however , for large values of the coupling constant we can not study very large values of @xmath212 since the system is finite .",
    "figure [ long_2 ] shows the exponential decay coefficient in @xmath235 in the asymptotic limit @xmath208 , where the exponential approximation becomes accurate .",
    "@xmath236 is also shown for reference . in the vacuum sector @xmath229",
    "decreases monotonically down to the universal value @xmath237 ( not seen in graph ) .",
    "for @xmath238 the double - soliton sector has similar behavior . however , for small values of @xmath3 the discussed lower bound is not satisfied , @xmath239 , as we enter the regime where @xmath172 is the most significant factor and the exponential approximation breaks down .",
    "let us now turn to the second factor , which dominates for relatively low coupling ( @xmath220 ) .",
    "as described in appendix a the double - soliton solutions depart from @xmath33 ( eq . [ sgkink ] ) as we require a finite system and impose @xmath240 .",
    "the separation of the solitons @xmath181 is given by a parameter @xmath182 , where @xmath181 monotonically increases with @xmath182 .",
    "stability ( @xmath241 ) regions of the system are defined in separate intervals of @xmath182 . as the values of @xmath182 in an arbitrary interval get closer to the interval boundaries , @xmath172 becomes closer to zero .",
    "therefore , we obtain an oscillatory behavior of @xmath172 with the separation @xmath181 , which strengthens as discreteness increases ( @xmath3 decreases ) . in figure",
    "[ delicate ] we present @xmath186 as a function of the separation between the solitons @xmath181 , where @xmath242 . for reference we present on the same graph @xmath243 so that both plots are more or less on the same magnitude .",
    "note that maximal entanglement is achieved for minimal @xmath244 .",
    "clearly , in this regime long - range entanglement is _ no longer _ a monotonically decreasing function of the distance between the solitons .    in figure [ regimes ] we show both @xmath245 and @xmath246 as a function of @xmath186 for three coupling values @xmath247 . in the close to critical regime ( @xmath248 )",
    "the particle - like behavior of the solitons is a dominant factor as it is a monotonic function of the entanglement , where the first internal mode has no significant effect ( its minimal value does not correspond to maximal entanglement ) . in the deep noncritical regime",
    "the particle like behavior has no significant effect as @xmath245 is approximately constant ( slightly above @xmath15 ) , and the dominant factor is @xmath244 .",
    "in the case @xmath249 , we see that in general , the entanglement increases with @xmath245 and decreases with @xmath172 .",
    "however , there is an intermediate region , where the entanglement is not a monotonic function of both factors .",
    "we turn now to the weak - coupling limit of the fk model , which is characterized by small values of @xmath3 . here",
    "the entanglement has far less dramatic effects .",
    "no long - range entanglement has been detected between two kinks .",
    "in addition , the von neumann entropy of an increasing block inside the kink loses its localization as the coupling constant becomes too low , as seen in figure [ discrete ] . for @xmath250",
    "there are two internal modes in the soliton sector of the fk model @xcite , where the second internal mode has an eigenfrequency close to one .",
    "however , the additional internal mode has no significant contribution to the entanglement of the kinks .",
    "in this section we suggest and investigate the possible use of solitons as carriers of quantum information .",
    "we observed in the previous sections that the entanglement properties of solitons in their ground state are strongly related to the presence of internal localized modes .",
    "these are ( usually ) the lowest discrete modes in the spectrum of the normal modes .",
    "the internal modes qualitatively describe collective or vibrational perturbations of the classical soliton . in our approximation method",
    "the soliton is handled as a non - perturbative classical object while the internal modes are linear perturbations around it .",
    "the quantized internal modes then correspond to `` phonon '' bound states .",
    "our suggestion therefore is to use the localized internal modes degrees of freedom as carriers of quantum information .",
    "since the modes are `` attached '' to the soliton , by moving the soliton under suitable adiabatic conditions , information may be transported without being disturbed or mixed with the phonon band .",
    "it is also possible to formulate multi - soliton processes which create entanglement , and therefore manipulate the information carried by each of the solitons .    to our knowledge",
    "this idea has not been investigated .",
    "therefore we provide a preliminary study of this possibility without elaborating on a particular implementation . in our model information",
    "will be coded by exciting the internal mode(s ) .",
    "a fundamental requirement in quantum information processing is the possibility of local operations .",
    "however , the internal modes are collective degrees of freedom of all the particles in the system . to resolve this difficulty one has to show that a local addressing of the particles in the core of the soliton is sufficient in order to manipulate the internal mode(s ) with high fidelity .",
    "such a process seems possible since the internal modes are localized .    to support the above requirement we present two results regarding the single soliton and double - soliton respectively :    \\(1 )",
    "suppose we perform two - mode - squeezing of the internal mode with some arbitrary external degrees of freedom , @xmath251 .",
    "then the entanglement inserted by squeezing is saturated by the entanglement of local degrees of freedom inside the soliton .",
    "\\(2 ) suppose we perform two - mode squeezing of two new collective modes that are linear combinations of the internal modes , such that the new modes are confined to the left and right sides of the chain respectively .",
    "then the entanglement inserted by squeezing is saturated by local degrees of freedom inside each of the two solitons .    both of these results are crucial for any quantum information applications , as otherwise operations can not be implemented locally .",
    "let us start with the first requirement .",
    "we write the normal modes of the system as : @xmath252 where eq .",
    "[ fields ] can be rewritten as @xmath253 and @xmath254 in matrix form .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the internal mode are @xmath255 .",
    "the ground state of the system is clearly @xmath256 two - mode squeezing @xmath257 of the internal mode and @xmath251 is defined by @xmath258 where @xmath204 is the squeezing parameter .",
    "the squeezing acts on the internal mode and @xmath251 directly through : @xmath259 we can plug @xmath257 into the covariance matrix @xmath260 where @xmath261 and @xmath262 is the diagonal vacuum covariance matrix in the normal modes .",
    "we show that for sufficiently large block @xmath131 , which includes the soliton , the distillable entanglement @xmath263 between local degrees of freedom inside @xmath131 and @xmath251 saturates the inserted entanglement via squeezing : @xmath264 from hashing inequality @xcite , @xmath265 where @xmath132 complements @xmath131 in the chain so that @xmath266 in figure [ sqq ] we plot @xmath267 as a function of @xmath59 for @xmath151 .",
    "@xmath268 is shown for reference .",
    "note that indeed @xmath269 saturates @xmath268 for @xmath270 .",
    "we would like to provide a qualitative explanation of the saturation obtained in figure [ sqq ] .",
    "note that the discussed saturation does not depend on the existence of an internal mode , but on the shape of the squeezing .",
    "the internal modes are required for the entanglement to stay in the squeezing window , but at @xmath271 they do not have a significant role , where an arbitrary collective mode @xmath272 , which has the shape of a bound state , will be saturated by local modes .",
    "we therefore turn to analyze the vacuum sector .",
    "we specify two blocks in the chain as can be seen in figure [ hash_fig ] : the squeezing block @xmath273 and the entanglement measuring block @xmath131 , where @xmath274 .",
    "we measure the entanglement between @xmath251 and @xmath131 . in addition , let us assume that @xmath272 decays significantly outside @xmath273 .",
    "saturation of the hashing inequality means : @xmath275 .",
    "as the whole state is gaussian we use the mode - wise decomposition @xcite .",
    "that is , the state is described by a product of composed collective modes from @xmath131 and @xmath276 : @xmath277 come from collective modes that are localized at the boundaries between @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the localization of less significant modes tends to the center of @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , modes that are well concentrated inside @xmath273 contribute very little to the initial entanglement .",
    "the hashing inequality is saturated if after squeezing , @xmath278 does not change much , that is , almost all entanglement that is inserted by squeezing is added to @xmath279 .    to see that this is the case consider the following simplified model .",
    "let us assume that before squeezing the state can be expressed as a product of two composite states : @xmath280 where @xmath281 is a strongly entangled mode , such that @xmath282 is localized at the boundaries of @xmath131 ( outside @xmath273 ) and @xmath283 is a weakly entangled mode , such that @xmath284 is localized inside @xmath273 .",
    "squeezing entangles @xmath284 to @xmath251 but it only weakly entangles @xmath282 to @xmath251 . the entanglement between @xmath132 and @xmath251 is therefore modified by two negligible contributions : one from weak squeezing ( @xmath285 ) and the second from weak entanglement in the first place ( @xmath286 ) .",
    "we turn now to the second result regarding double - soliton solutions .",
    "now the two internal modes are symmetric and antisymmetric respectively .",
    "they are not confined to a single soliton each .",
    "we want to create entanglement between the solitons by squeezing .",
    "therefore , we should use collective modes , where each is confined to a single soliton .",
    "let us define the linear transformation : @xmath287 in the case the internal modes are almost degenerate , @xmath288 are localized well to each of the solitons . note that this condition corresponds to poor long - range _ vacuum _ entanglement of the solitons , as described in section @xmath5 .",
    "practically degenerate internal modes appear only deep in the noncritical regime of the double - soliton sector ( @xmath220 ) , as shown in figure [ collective ] , where we plot @xmath288 for @xmath289 and @xmath105 .",
    "we therefore assume that @xmath289 . in correspondence with the single soliton squeezing ,",
    "we define @xmath290 as optimal squeezing of the two solitons .",
    "we would like to show that the inserted entanglement by squeezing @xmath291 ( eq . [ inserted_ent ] ) is saturated by local degrees of freedom inside the two solitons : @xmath292 and @xmath293 with the same size . from symmetry , @xmath294 .",
    "hashing inequality implies that , @xmath295 in figure [ sqq2 ] we plot @xmath296 as a function of blocks size @xmath59 , where the center of the blocks coincide with the center of the solitons .",
    "@xmath291 is plotted for reference .",
    "note that the distillable entanglement saturates the inserted entanglement for @xmath297 .",
    "therefore , local degrees of freedom saturate @xmath291 .",
    "interestingly , the distillable entanglement actually exceeds the inserted entanglement through squeezing .",
    "this is explained by the fact that for large blocks the distance between them becomes very small , such that the vacuum entanglement has a non - negligible contribution .",
    "finally , based on the above analysis , we would like to briefly discuss two possible applications : entanglement transportation and entanglement manipulation through a tunneling gate . in the entanglement transportation task",
    "we assume there is an additional external degree of freedom , @xmath251 .",
    "initially the soliton is located in one side of the system , next to , say , alice .",
    "alice entangles @xmath251 to some _ local _ degrees of freedom inside the soliton .",
    "then she classically transport the soliton to the other side , next to bob .",
    "finally , bob possesses local degrees of freedom inside the soliton with which he can , _",
    "e.g. _ , perform experiments that prove nonlocal correlations with @xmath251 . in order to keep the state gaussian ,",
    "the entanglement is realized by two - mode squeezing .",
    "in addition , we assume slow transportation so that the quantum modes are perturbed only adiabatically .    in the second implementation we use the double - soliton sector .",
    "quantum information is tunneled between the solitons by bringing them close to each other for a finite time interval and then separate them apart .",
    "this application is much more complicated than the first one , as we require that the phonon band is not excited during the tunneling phase , while the internal modes do .",
    "we conclude with the main results in this work and proposals for further study . we have shown that the entanglement of solitons manifests particle - like behavior as they are characterized by localization of entanglement and long - range entanglement .",
    "the von - neumann entropy of solitons mixes both critical and noncritical behaviors , where it increases logarithmically inside the core of the soliton , reaches a maximal value and then decreases and saturates the constant value that corresponds to the massive vacuum sector .",
    "interestingly , the increase of the entanglement inside the core is faster than that in a universal critical field .",
    "in addition , we have shown that two solitons manifest long - range entanglement , which may not decrease with their separation in the noncritical regime .",
    "near the critical regime the entanglement decreases slower than the corresponding universal critical field .",
    "our quantum model is based on linear perturbations around a nonlinear classic solution .",
    "higher order corrections @xcite are important for the treatment of the zero mode in the infinite system . in this case one",
    "obtains non - linear terms which couple the solitons collective coordinate with the phonon modes .",
    "it would be interesting to explore classical configurations of two non - static solitons which can produce entanglement through their mutual phonon modes . moreover , certain models , such as the @xmath0 , manifest in addition to the zero mode a nonzero internal mode which is associated with local shape deformations",
    ". it would be interesting to study mechanisms for entanglement of the internal modes in soliton - soliton scattering @xcite and in soliton - impurity scattering @xcite .",
    "we suggest that solitons internal modes be used as carriers of quantum information .",
    "since the modes are `` attached '' to the soliton , by moving the soliton under suitable adiabatic conditions , information may be transported without being disturbed or mixed with the phonon band .",
    "our proposal differs from previously suggested methods , which employ a collective displacement of the soliton using long josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "realizations of the present suggestion can possibly be achieved either in discrete systems such as trapped ions or in an effectively one - dimensional bose - einstein condensate , which manifests soliton solutions @xcite .",
