    "the gross - neveu ( gn ) model in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite is probably the simplest interacting fermionic field theory one can write down , @xmath1 ( here , @xmath2 is a flavor index , and the model is defined through the t hooft limit @xmath3 , @xmath4 const .",
    "@xcite ) . yet , as evidenced by more than 900 citations in the hep - archive to date , this toy model has turned out to be quite valuable for a variety of physics questions ( for a recent review and a discussion of subtleties associated with low dimensions , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . if one solves it via semi - classical methods following the original 1974 paper , a surprising number of phenomena of interest to strong interaction physics unfold . already in ref .",
    "@xcite asymptotic freedom , spontaneous breaking of the discrete chiral symmetry @xmath5 , dynamical fermion mass generation and a scalar @xmath6 bound state ( the @xmath7-meson ) were demonstrated .",
    "the version with continuous chiral symmetry , the two - dimensional nambu  jona - lasinio model @xcite ( njl@xmath8 ) possesses an additional massless @xmath9-meson . shortly afterwards",
    ", massive kink @xcite and kink - antikink @xcite type baryons were derived analytically in the discrete chiral model , whereas the njl@xmath8 model features massless baryons @xcite .",
    "promptly it was shown that chiral symmetry gets restored at finite temperature in a second order phase transition @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these early works , it took a rather long and winding road to determine the full phase structure of the gn model at finite chemical potential and temperature . in 1985",
    ", the first phase diagram was proposed @xcite , followed by a number of works elaborating on it ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "its prominent features were two phases ( massive and massless quarks ) , separated by a line of first and second order transitions meeting at a tricritical point . in a density - temperature plot",
    ", a mixed phase would appear in the region of low density and temperature .",
    "it can be pictured as droplets of chirally restored vacuum containing extra quarks , embedded in the symmetry broken vacuum  reminiscent of the mit bag model @xcite . at the first order phase transition ,",
    "the droplets fill all space @xcite .",
    "this scenario as well as the underlying phase diagram were believed to hold for both variants of the gn model ( with discrete and continuous chiral symmetry ) @xcite . only in 2000",
    "it was noticed that the phase diagram was hard to reconcile with the known baryon spectrum . in the case of the njl@xmath8 model , a thermodynamically more stable solution of the mean field equations turned out to be one where the chiral condensate assumes a helical form , namely a circle in the ( @xmath10 ) plane superimposed with a uniform translation along the @xmath11 axis ( a  chiral spiral \" @xcite ) . since the winding number is equal to baryon number , one can regard this structure as a caricature of a skyrme crystal @xcite , a point of view emphasized in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this helical order parameter was subsequently confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ( substantially ) modified phase diagram of the njl@xmath8 model is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as the bosonization technique based on the massless boson is unavailable in the gn model with discrete chiral symmetry , it took somewhat longer to construct a satisfactory phase diagram for this model . following a variational calculation which clearly showed the existence of a crystal ground state at @xmath12 and any finite density @xcite ,",
    "the full phase diagram was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on a numerical solution of the dirac - hartree - fock equations .",
    "the main new feature is the appearance of a third phase , a kink - antikink crystal , in addition to the two previously known homogeneous phases .",
    "it supersedes the mixed phase in the old phase diagram .",
    "all transitions are second order , and the tricritical point gets transmuted into a lifshitz point characteristic for the transition from an inhomogeneous to a homogeneous ordered phase in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the mechanism which drives the spontaneous breakdown of translational invariance at finite density was identified as overhauser effect @xcite with gap formation at the fermi surface .",
    "more recently , guided by these results , the analytic form of the self - consistent scalar potential at @xmath12 has been guessed correctly and the self - consistency of the crystal ground state could be established analytically @xcite .",
    "many of the previous numerical results can now be written down in a concise , analytical way .",
    "instrumental for this solution was the fact that by using an appropriate scalar potential expressed in terms of jacobi elliptic functions , the dirac - hartree - fock equation could be mapped onto a schrdinger equation with the lam potential which was solved analytically long time ago @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend the work of ref .",
    "@xcite to finite temperature .",
    "it turns out that the ansatz for the self - consistent potential used in @xcite is general enough to encompass the self - consistent potential at any temperature and chemical potential .",
    "apart from the obvious benefit of analytic insight into the phase structure of the gn model , our results have proven helpful in uncovering some striking relationship between the gn model and certain problems in condensed matter physics , notably in the context of superconductivity .",

    "in a previous paper , we have pointed out that gn type models can be reinterpreted as relativistic superconductors @xcite .",
    "this is due to a 2-dimensional remnant of the pauli - grsey symmetry of massless fermions @xcite .",
    "it allows us to define `` particle '' and `` anti - particle '' independently for left - handed and right - handed quarks .",
    "models with fermion - antifermion pairing ( chiral condensate ) and fermion - fermion pairing ( cooper pairs ) can then be mapped onto each other by a `` duality '' transformation . the phase diagram",
    "which we have discussed above is equivalent to the phase diagram of a theory with lagrangian @xmath281 provided we replace the chemical potential @xmath282 by the axial chemical potential @xmath283 ( see ref .",
    "the kink - antikink phase of the gn model can then be identified with the larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrel ( loff ) phase @xcite of the dual model .",
    "such inhomogeneous superconductors have recently attracted considerable attention in the context of qcd ( for a current review article , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    actually , there is yet another kind of connection between the gn model and non - relativistic condensed matter systems which is even more surprising .",
    "although the gn model is mentioned occasionally in the corresponding condensed matter literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , it seems that this close relationship has never been exploited in a systematic way .",
    "the physics of the problems we have in mind is totally different from the gn model , yet the mathematical analogies are striking .",
    "let us discuss a few pertinent references which we came across when looking for parallels between the phase diagram of the gn model and that of quasi - one - dimensional solid state systems .",
    "this may be regarded as a continuation of the work of jackiw and schrieffer @xcite on kinks in condensed matter and relativistic field theories to finite kink densities .",
    "the first example is a 1981 paper by mertsching and fischbeck on the peierls - frhlich model @xcite .",
    "these authors address the quasi - one - dimensional frhlich model with a nearly half - filled band , an electron - phonon system .",
    "they are interested in the phase diagram , notably the transition between commensurate - incommensurate charge density waves , using a mean field approximation .",
    "there seems to be a mathematical one - to - one correspondence between this system and the gn model .",
    "the authors of ref .  @xcite have also found the analytic solution to the mean field equation , guided by the landau expansion around the triple point ( which is called leung point @xcite in this context ) .",
    "crucial for the close correspondence with a relativistic field theory are evidently a continuum approximation ( the lattice constant acts as inverse cutoff and is taken to 0 ) and a linearization of the electron dispersion relation near the fermi surface ( simulating  ultrarelativistic kinematics \" ) .",
    "in appropriate units , the results are identical to ours , as far as we can tell .    in a subsequent paper , machida and nakanishi",
    "@xcite used the phase diagram of ref .",
    "@xcite in a different physics context : they studied the interplay of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in errh@xmath284b@xmath284 ( erbium - rhodium - boride ) .",
    "thanks to a number of approximations ( in particular the one - dimensional band model with linear dispersion ) they managed to reduce this problem mathematically to the peierls - frhlich model . for real order parameter ,",
    "their results are again fully equivalent to ours for the gn model , except that now one has to use another dictionary : the dirac equation corresponds to the bogoliubov - degennes equation , particle / antiparticle degrees of freedom to spin ( which exists in a quasi - one - dimensional world ) , chemical potential to magnetic field , baryon density to spin polarization",
    ". our three phases ( massive , crystal and massless ) correspond to their bcs ,  sn \" and normal phases , respectively .",
    "the order parameter at @xmath12 looks different from ours at first sight .",
    "however , the two expressions can be converted into each other by landen s transformation for jacobi functions @xcite in the form @xmath285 not only the phase boundaries , but all observables can be identified if one keeps in mind the above mentioned dictionary .",
    "nevertheless , there are subtle differences which show that one should not take over results blindly : the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also discuss complex order parameters , in particular a helical phase . in the discrete chiral gn model ,",
    "the order parameter is always real . in the continuous chiral njl@xmath8 model",
    ", it can be complex and we have indeed found a helical phase @xcite , but the results for the phase diagram are different . here",
    "apparently the quantitative correspondence between relativistic field theory and solid state physics ends due to some differences in dynamics .    as a third example",
    ", we would like to mention the more recent work of buzdin and kachkachi @xcite .",
    "they derive the ginzburg - landau theory for nonuniform loff superconductors near the tricritical point in the ( @xmath286)-phase diagram in one , two and three dimensions .",
    "if we take their result for one dimension and specialize it to a real order parameter , we find perfect agreement between our eq .",
    "( [ w16 ] ) and their eq .",
    "( 3 ) in appropriate units ( a discrepancy in the sign of the @xmath287 term must be due to a misprint ) .",
    "we have to identify their magnetic field @xmath288 with our chemical potential @xmath97 .",
    "one can find many more similar studies in the literature , see e.g. the recent review article on stripe phases @xcite .",
    "our fourth example is related to solitons in trans - polyacetylene , starting with the seminal paper by su , schrieffer and heeger @xcite . in this case",
    "there have been efforts to bridge the gap between particle and solid state physics by chodos and minakata @xcite .",
    "since these authors start from the old phase diagram of the gross - neveu model , they notice that there are some discrepancies with the soliton lattice theory of horovitz @xcite . however , the analytical results of horovitz agree perfectly with our kink - antikink crystal so that everything falls into place .",
    "let us also mention in passing the results of okuno and onodera on the coexistence of a soliton and a polaron in trans - polyacetylene @xcite which are apparently closely related to the recent work of feinberg @xcite on the analogous phenomenon in the gross - neveu model .    finally ,",
    "when browsing through the literature on superconductivity , we were amused to discover that the `` old '' phase diagram of the gn model ( assuming unbroken translational invariance ) is ubiquitous in textbooks and articles on bcs theory ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , fig .",
    "it seems to go back to a 1963 paper @xcite which predates the original gn paper by more than one decade and the first published gn phase diagram by more than two decades .",
    "summarizing , we find it gratifying that the gn model with its simple lagrangian gives rise to such a physically rich phase diagram .",
    "its structure seems to be mirrored by a variety of quasi - one - dimensional condensed matter systems .",
    "with hindsight , one might ask the question why it took much longer to solve the same mathematical problem in relativistic quantum field theory than in condensed matter physics .",
    "we feel that this is due to the almost exclusive use of path integral methods in particle physics .",
    "apparently , these methods are not yet sufficiently developed to yield non - trivial saddle points with unexpected symmetry breakdown as in the present case .",
    "by contrast , canonical mean - field calculations offer a rich spectrum of approximation methods ( variational , numerical etc . ) which can be successively refined and used to nail down eventually the exact solution as in the case at hand .",
    "it is probably not accidental that we arrived at the phase diagram of the gn model using hartree - fock methods akin to the standard tools of condensed matter physics .",
