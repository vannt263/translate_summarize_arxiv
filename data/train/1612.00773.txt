    "it has long been appreciated that if dark matter ( dm ) is a majorana fermion and if the theory respects minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) , then dark matter annihilation to light standard model ( sm ) fermions is @xmath0-wave suppressed in the chiral limit . nevertheless , @xmath0-wave annihilation can be an important process in the early universe during the epoch of thermal dark matter freeze - out , when this velocity - suppression is only an @xmath1 effect . in the current epoch , when this velocity suppression is large ( @xmath2 ) , indirect detection signals may instead by dominated by other annihilation processes , such as virtual internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) , or annihilation to photons via a one - loop diagram . in this work",
    ", we consider the constraints on these annihilation processes which can arise from associated corrections to the charge radii of the standard model fermions .",
    "if dark matter ( @xmath3 ) annihilates to charged sm fermions ( @xmath4 ) through the @xmath5-channel exchange of charged mediating particles , then there is necessarily a one - loop correction to the fermion - photon vertex arising from diagrams where @xmath3 and the charged mediators run in the loop ( see figure  [ fig : feynffandchargeradius ] ) .",
    "it has previously been shown  @xcite that the @xmath6-wave dark matter annihilation matrix element is directly correlated with the associated correction to the electric and magnetic dipole moments of the sm fermions .",
    "this connection follows from general principles : the annihilation process @xmath7 can only proceed from an @xmath6-wave initial state if there is some mixing of sm fermion helicities , and the electromagnetic form factors which contribute to helicity mixing yield the electric and magnetic dipole moments in the limit of small momentum transfer .",
    "one might expect that the annihilation matrix elements which do not mix sm fermion weyl spinors can be similarly correlated with corrections to the electromagnetic form factors which do not mix sm fermion weyl spinors , and we will see that this is indeed the case . in particular , these annihilation matrix elements can be related to the correction to the fermion charge radius , which parameterizes the correction to the helicity - preserving form factor in the limit of small momentum transfer .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     if @xmath8 , then a correction to the charge radius which is large enough to be constrained by lep data would already be close to ( if not ruled out by ) the perturbativity limit , @xmath9 .",
    "it is thus already clear that , given the constraints on charged mediators from the lhc , current charge radius bounds from lep can only be of limited utility in constraining dark matter annihilation .",
    "but future analyses at experiments with higher energy and luminosity could yield much more precise measurements of the charge radius .    for the remainder of this section",
    ", we will focus on the case @xmath10 , @xmath11 and consider two different scenarios : current muon charge radius bounds from lep , and the possibility that the bound on the muon charge radius could be improved by a factor of 10 with future experiments .",
    "since the cross section bounds arising from charge radii measurements scale as @xmath12 , one can easily rescale these bounds for a different choice of @xmath13 , or for future constraints on @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , the maximum cross section consistent with perturbativity ( for any of the channels we have discussed ) scales as @xmath15 ; one can easily rescale the perturbativity limit for a different choice of @xmath13 .      at the time of dark matter thermal freeze - out",
    ", one typically expects  @xcite @xmath16 .",
    "we can express the @xmath7 @xmath0-wave annihilation cross section as _",

    "the red long - dashed contour describes the constraints which arise from current bounds on the muon charge radius , while the blue short - dashed contour describes the constraints which would arise if the charge radius were constrained to be 10 times smaller by future data .",
    "the regions above the contours are excluded , assuming that there is no other source for corrections to the fermion charge radius .",
    "also plotted is the largest cross section consistent with perturbativity ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we see that , if the precision of fermion charge radius can reach the @xmath21 level for @xmath22 , then models in which the dark matter relic density in early universe is depleted by two - body @xmath0-wave annihilation would be correlated with a measurable charge radius correction .     bounds on @xmath17 ( in pb ) arising from measurements of standard model fermion charge radii , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath23 .",
    "the red long - dashed contour corresponds to the case where @xmath24 ( the current limit on the muon charge radius correction ) , and the blue short - dashed contour corresponds to the case where @xmath25 .",

    "the region above the curves is excluded , if there are no other corrections to the fermion charge radii .",

    "the red long - dashed contour corresponds to the case where @xmath24 ( the current limit on the muon charge radius correction ) , and the blue short - dashed contour corresponds to the case where @xmath25 .",
    "the region above the curves is excluded , if there are no other corrections to the fermion charge radii .",
    "also shown is the perturbativity limit ( black solid).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the process @xmath33 can proceed from an @xmath6-wave initial state , but @xmath30 is suppressed by a factor @xmath34 .",
    "this cross section will be somewhat larger than @xmath17 in the current epoch .",
    "moreover , because this annihilation process produces monoenergetic photons , the signal is much more easily detected above background .",
    "as a result , this process will be much more important than @xmath7 for indirect detection in the current epoch . for @xmath35",
    ", we find that constraints on the @xmath33 annihilation process arising from fermion charge radii measurements could exceed current constraints from fermi - lat by more than three orders of magnitude ( absent fine - tuning ) , if the charge radii corrections could be measured at the @xmath21 level .",
    "dark matter annihilation via internal bremsstrahlung is an @xmath6-wave process , but instead receives a factor @xmath36 suppression . for @xmath37",
    ", however , the photon spectrum arising from internal bremsstrahlung is very hard ; the photon spectrum is similar in shape to a line signal , implying that the ib cross section can also be constrained by line signal searches using fermi - lat  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath35 , fermion charge radii constraints on @xmath31 could surpass fermi - lat constraints on ib in the nearly - degenerate limit by up to two orders of magnitude , if the charge radii can be measured at the @xmath21 level .",
    "for @xmath38 , however , the photon spectrum will be smooth , and the sensitivity of fermi - lat and other indirect detection experiments will be significantly weaker",
    ". measurements of the fermion charge radii at the @xmath21 level would thus provide an even more dramatic improvement over current indirect detection results .",
    "but for @xmath39 , however , we see that indirect detection prospects will in any case tend to be dominated by the process @xmath33 .",
    "we have seen that measurements of standard model fermion charge radii can be used to constrain cross sections for dark matter annihilation in scenarios where dark matter couples to sm fermions through a charged mediator , and where helicity mixing is suppressed . in particular , the @xmath0-wave cross section for the process @xmath7 , and @xmath6-wave cross sections for the internal bremsstrahlung process @xmath28 and the one - loop process @xmath33 , can be constrained by measurements of fermion charge radii .",
    "however , it is always possible for other new physics , unrelated to dark matter , to produce canceling corrections to the charge radius , allowing a large annihilation cross section to be consistent with experimental data . as such",
    ", the bounds we have found do not correspond to a rigorous limit , but rather demarcate the rough point at which fine - tuning would be needed in order to retain consistency with the data .",
    "it is worth noting that the annihilation processes @xmath40 can only proceed if dark matter couples to sm fermions through an interaction mediated by a charged particle .",
    "there will thus always be a correction to the fermion - photon vertex arising from a one - loop diagram where dark matter and the charged mediators run in the loop .",
    "thus , the correlation between the fermion charge radius correction and the @xmath40 annihilation cross sections is robust .",
    "unfortunately , current measurements of the fermion charge radii from lep are not precise enough to yield useful constraints on dark matter annihilation .",
    "but future experiments such as vheep  @xcite and ilc could provide much tighter constraints on the sm fermion charge radii .",
    "as the annihilation cross sections scale as @xmath41 , even a modest improvement in charge radii constraints would correspond to a dramatic improvement in constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section .",
    "for example , a high - luminosity run at vheep could yield an improvement in charge radii measurements of an order of magnitude  @xcite , resulting in an improvement in bounds on dark matter annihilation of @xmath42 .",
    "such a dramatic improvement would result in constraints which essentially exceed all current observational bounds for all of the channels which we have considered over the entire range of @xmath18 at @xmath35 .",
    "high - luminosity @xmath43 colliders would be ideally suited for this type of study  @xcite .",
