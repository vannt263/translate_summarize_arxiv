    "the search continues for a theory which describes gravity on quantum scales , and provides us with falsifiable experimental predictions ( for a review , see , for example , @xcite ) . in recent years",
    ", the subject of quantum gravity phenomenology has rapidly grown ( see @xcite for a review ) , complementing theoretical work .",
    "one particular feature of quantum gravity which has attracted much attention in particle and astro - particle physics phenomenology is the breaking of cpt symmetry ( see , for example , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "cpt symmetry is anticipated to be broken in quantum gravity because the prerequisite conditions of quantum coherence , locality or lorentz invariance may no longer hold . in previous work",
    "@xcite we have studied the effect of quantum decoherence on atmospheric and astrophysical neutrino oscillations , and in the present work we turn our attention to lorentz invariance violation .",
    "we focus on atmospheric neutrino oscillations , having considered lorentz invariance violating effects on astrophysical neutrinos in @xcite . as in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "in this paper we take a phenomenological viewpoint .",
    "we examine , independent of any one particular theory of quantum gravity , what we may expect to observe if lorentz symmetry is broken or deformed .",
    "there is already a large body of work relating to lorentz invariance violation and neutrinos , some of which is briefly reviewed in the following section .",
    "furthermore , existing atmospheric neutrino data has been thoroughly analyzed for both lorentz invariance violating effects and other new physics ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "although the analysis of super - kamiokande and k2k data @xcite strongly disfavours lorentz invariance violation as either the leading or sub - leading cause of atmospheric neutrino oscillations , an analysis of high - energy atmospheric neutrino oscillations , as would be observed at a neutrino telescope , would enable a wider range of lorentz invariance violating models to be probed , as well as offering the possibility of further strengthening existing bounds on lorentz invariance violating parameters .",
    "this can be seen in the recent analysis of macro data @xcite using both low ( @xmath0 30 gev ) and high ( @xmath1 130 gev ) energy neutrinos .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the sensitivity of the antares neutrino telescope @xcite to lorentz invariance violating effects although we expect a similar analysis to be applicable to other neutrino telescopes , such as icecube @xcite , nestor @xcite and nemo @xcite . whilst neutrino telescopes are primarily designed to observe neutrinos from astrophysical and cosmological origins , atmospheric neutrinos form the primary background to these sources and it is likely that they will provide the first physics results .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] , we briefly discuss some of the theoretical consequences from lorentz invariance violation , in particular modified dispersion relations .",
    "we then model how modified dispersion relations alter atmospheric neutrino oscillations in section [ sec : mdr ] .",
    "we present the results of our simulations for the antares neutrino telescope in section [ sec : sim ] , where we first consider how the observed spectra of events may be altered by lorentz invariance violating effects and then present the results of our sensitivity simulations . in section [ sec : conc ] , we present our conclusions and compare the results obtained here with those from previous analyses of experimental data @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we use units in which @xmath2 .",
    "in quantum gravity , space - time is expected to take on a foamy nature @xcite .",
    "models of space - time foam have been built in many frameworks , including critical @xcite and non - critical string theory @xcite , and loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "interactions with this space - time foam may lead to the breaking of cpt symmetry , leading to the violation of lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "in addition , some theories of quantum gravity predict that there is a minimum length scale , of order the planck length ( @xmath3 m ) @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , then the existence of a fundamental length scale may also lead to lorentz invariance violation ( lv ) .    to illustrate this ,",
    "imagine if we were able to somehow measure this fundamental length scale .",
    "we could measure it in our lab frame and probably find that it was of order the planck length , @xmath3 m. if we now repeated the experiment in a different inertial frame ( moving relative to the first frame ) , we would expect the length to be shorter , as predicted by the usual lorentz contraction .",
    "however , we are considering a fundamental length scale and , therefore , we would also expect to measure the same length in all inertial frames .",
    "there is , therefore , either an error in our naive thought experiment or lorentz symmetry , at least at the planck scale , is broken .",
    "therefore , there exist three possibilities for the fate of lorentz invariance within theories of quantum gravity :    1",
    ".   it may be that our naive thought experiment is wrong , or that a fundamental length scale does not exist , and so lorentz invariance remains intact at planck scales ; 2 .   it may be that , at the planck scale , lorentz invariance is broken and there is a preferred frame ; 3 .",
    "it may be that lorentz invariance as we know it is deformed , so , for example , the lorentz transformation involves a second quantity which is not observer dependent .",
    "so , perhaps the planck length is invariant in an identical way to the speed of light .    in the second and third options , one consequence of such breaking / deforming of lorentz invariance",
    "may be that quantities we think of as being lorentz invariant , such as the standard dispersion relation , @xmath4 , may also have to be modified .",
    "lorentz invariance violation may manifest itself in many different ways and in many different experimental systems @xcite .",
    "our focus here is on neutrinos and modified dispersion relations .",
    "however , modifications of dispersion relations have also been considered for photons @xcite , leading to dispersion relations of the form @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the frequency of the photon , @xmath7 its momentum and @xmath8 is the mass scale of the quantum gravitational theory . by considering photons which originate in astrophysical objects such as gamma ray bursts and pulsars , lower bounds of @xmath9 gev @xcite were placed on @xmath8 by considering the delay in arrival times .    in the literature",
    ", the effects of lv on neutrino oscillations can be broken down into two distinct categories . in the first category",
    "are those models in which the only modification is to the neutrino oscillation length @xcite , which is the type of lv model we shall consider in this paper . in the second category",
    "are those models in which both the oscillation length and also the mixing angle are altered . in our simulations , we found that including lv effects on the mixing angle as well as the neutrino oscillation length made no difference to our results and so we do not study this type of model in detail .",
    "this type of lv , where both the mixing angle and oscillation length are altered , has been considered for the icecube @xcite and minos @xcite experiments in addition to future neutrino factories @xcite .",
    "our interest in this paper is how lv effects , as described in the previous section , may alter the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "therefore , in the analysis which follows , we restrict ourselves to a simple two neutrino system although it is possible to consider how these effects manifest themselves in a three neutrino system @xcite .",
    "if we allow lv then this may lead to modifications of the dispersion relation @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy of the neutrino , @xmath12 the neutrino momentum , @xmath13 is the mass eigenvalue of the neutrino and @xmath14 is the planck energy .",
    "the function @xmath15 contains all the novel lv effects . for our analysis here , we find it useful to parameterize this function so the dispersion relation ( [ lvtheory : eqn : moddisp ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are parameters of the lorentz invariance violating theory .    using ( [ lvtheory : eqn : parmoddisp ] ) and assuming the parameter @xmath17 has a dependence upon the mass eigenstate",
    ", then we find that the hamiltonian in the mass basis , for a two neutrino system , may be written , to first order in @xmath17 , as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mass and lv parameter of the @xmath22th eigenstate . here",
    "we are considering only the case when the hamiltonian is diagonal in the mass basis , as off - diagonal terms will modify the neutrino mixing angle as well as the oscillation length .    the probability that a neutrino of flavour @xmath23 oscillates to one of flavour @xmath24 is then given by @xmath25 = \\left|\\sum_{i=1}^{2}u_{ai}e^{-h_{ii}}u_{bi}^{*}\\right|^{2},\\ ] ] where the @xmath26 s are the components of the neutrino mixing matrix : @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the mixing angle .",
    "the oscillation probability is therefore @xmath29 = \\sin^{2}2\\theta\\sin^{2}\\left[\\frac{\\delta m^{2}l}{4e}+\\frac{\\delta\\eta e^{\\alpha+1}l}{4e_{p}^{\\alpha}}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "replacing @xmath32 and @xmath33 and absorbing the planck energy into the parameter @xmath34 gives @xmath35 = \\sin^{2}2\\theta\\sin^{2}\\left[1.27\\frac{\\delta m^{2}l}{e}+1.27\\times10^{9(n+1)}\\delta\\eta e^{n}l\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is measured in ev@xmath37 , the neutrino energy @xmath11 in gev , the path length @xmath38 in km , and we have set @xmath39 .",
    "if we set @xmath40 in ( [ lvtheory : eqn:2nprobch ] ) , then we recover the standard oscillation probability @xmath41 = \\sin^{2}2\\theta\\sin^{2}\\left[1.27\\frac{\\delta m^{2}l}{e}\\right],\\ ] ] whereas , if we set @xmath42 , we find a probability in which neutrinos oscillate due to lv effects only : @xmath43 = \\sin^{2}2\\theta\\sin^{2}\\left[1.27\\times10^{9(n+1)}\\delta\\eta e^{n}l\\right ] .\\ ] ] in ( [ lvtheory : eqn:2neutlvham ] ) , we have assumed that the lv parameter @xmath17 has a dependence upon the mass eigenstate .",
    "if this is not the case and the parameter @xmath17 is universal to all mass eigenstates , then , even if the theory violates lorentz invariance , the neutrino oscillation probability is unchanged .    in this paper",
    ", we shall consider three models with differing energy dependences , namely :    1 .",
    "model lv1 - with @xmath44 : here the lv parameter @xmath45 in ( [ lvtheory : eqn:2nprobch ] ) is dimensionless ; 2 .",
    "model lv2 - with @xmath46 : then @xmath45 has units of ev@xmath47 ; 3 .",
    "model lv3 - with @xmath48 : in which case @xmath45 has units ev@xmath49",
    ".    it may be , in a phenomenology of quantum gravity , that @xmath50 is not an integer but we only consider integer values here ( the results for non - integer @xmath50 can be found by interpolating between the two bounding integer values ) .",
    "models with @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 have been examined using super - kamiokande @xcite data , and more complicated models with @xmath54 or @xmath53 have been analyzed using both super - kamiokande and k2k data @xcite .",
    "we do not consider @xmath55 here as @xmath54 models have been severely constrained by these previous analyses , and , since in that case the lv modifications of the oscillation probability are independent of the neutrino energy , we do not expect to be able to improve on their bounds by using higher - energy atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "therefore we only consider values of @xmath50 which are strictly positive , and include @xmath44 for comparison with previous work @xcite . from our work on quantum decoherence effects on atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite",
    ", one might anticipate that we will be able to place more stringent bounds on lv effects as @xmath50 increases .    in the next section ,",
    "we shall be concerned with finding upper bounds on the lv parameters .",
    "however , we are able to extract crude order of magnitude estimates for these parameters from the oscillation probability ( [ lvtheory : eqn:2nprobch ] ) .",
    "the lv effects only become significant when @xmath56 the peak in the atmospheric flux is of the order of @xmath53 gev , which is the typical energy scale for experiments such as super - kamiokande @xcite , whilst neutrino telescopes , such as antares , are sensitive to much higher energy neutrinos .",
    "table [ tab : estbounds ] shows a comparison of the typical bounds on @xmath34 for low and high energy neutrino experiments . here",
    ", we have taken the peak in the atmospheric flux , @xmath57 gev as the value of the neutrino energy for low energy experiments and @xmath58 gev as a typical value for neutrinos to be detected by a neutrino telescope such as antares .    as a comparison , the `` most conservative '' bound for @xmath44 from super - kamiokande data @xcite is @xmath59 at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the authors of @xcite comment that the strongest bounds are coming from upgoing muon events , which peak at about 100 gev , so their results are in line with naive expectations .",
    "the bounds of @xcite are improved by a factor of about 8 in the combined analysis of super - kamiokande and k2k data @xcite .",
    "we would hope that the much greater number of such events that will be observed at a neutrino telescope would enable these bounds to be improved .    to see how lorentz invariance violation affects atmospheric neutrino oscillations , it is useful to compare the oscillation probabilities . whilst the neutrino oscillation probabilities themselves are not observables , they are useful for gaining insight into the underlying physics .",

    "however , for higher energy neutrinos , this is not the case .",
    "if we compare the plots of probability against path length for high energy neutrinos , we see that for standard oscillations , almost no oscillations occur , however , if we include the lv effects , the oscillation probability becomes significant at much shorter path lengths . indeed , as @xmath50 increases",
    ", the probability becomes significant at smaller path lengths .",
    "when we consider the plots in which the probability is a function of energy , we see that for standard oscillations , the probability tends towards zero , where as , in the plots which include lv effects , the probability continues to oscillate with the period of oscillations decreasing for increasing values of @xmath50 .",
    "corresponding plots of atmospheric neutrino survival probabilities can be found in @xcite for the mass and velocity eigenstate mixing lv model .",
    "their plots have some features in common with ours , in particular the existence of oscillations in the probability at high energies , when the survival probability in the standard oscillation scenario has converged to unity .    in @xcite , we studied in depth the effect of quantum decoherence on atmospheric neutrino oscillations . in that case , there were also marked differences in the oscillation probability , particularly for high energies and long path lengths .",
    "however , the probabilities with lv are rather different from those when we have quantum decoherence . in the decoherence case ,",
    "the oscillations in the probability are damped ( the rate of damping depending on a number of factors ) , but here we find that the oscillations in the probability continue for ever . while these two possible sources of new physics give very different properties of the oscillation probability , the key test is whether these differences can be observed experimentally .",
    "we turn to this issue in the next section .",
    "the antares neutrino telescope @xcite is sensitive to high energy neutrinos above the energy threshold of 10 gev .",
    "these neutrinos do not form the primary source of neutrinos for antares , instead they form the background to astrophysical and cosmological neutrinos .",
    "our simulation strategy follows that presented in @xcite , so we only briefly outline the key features .",
    "further details are documented in @xcite , and in the analysis of standard atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite , on which our simulations are based ( with suitable modifications for the inclusion of lv ) .",
    "atmospheric neutrino events were generated using a monte - carlo ( mc ) production assuming a spectrum of @xmath67 for neutrinos in the energy range @xmath68 .",
    "the angular distribution was assumed to be isotropic .",
    "a total of twenty five years of data were simulated in order that errors from the monte - carlo statistics could be ignored and event weights are used to adapt the monte - carlo flux to a real atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "the bartol theoretical flux @xcite was used here although we do not anticipate the results presented will change using a different flux , however , there may be a significant change to our results if a different spectral index is assumed .",
    "the simulations presented here are based on three years worth of data taking with antares , corresponding to around 10000 atmospheric neutrino events .",
    "all errors are purely statistical with simple gaussian errors assumed .",
    "we are able to produce spectra in either @xmath11 , @xmath69 or @xmath38 and , by altering the oscillation probability in the neutrino oscillation code , we are able to include lv effects",
    ". the path length @xmath38 is related to the zenith angle @xmath70 ( not to be confused with the mixing angle @xmath71 ) as follows , provided @xmath72 : @xmath73 where @xmath74 km is the radius of the earth , and @xmath75 corresponds to a neutrino travelling vertically upwards .",
    "we are therefore interested in typical path lengths of the order @xmath76 km .",
    "antares is particularly sensitive to the zenith angle @xmath70 and hence the path length @xmath38 . in the sensitivity analysis",
    ", we therefore used the spectra in @xmath69 .",
    "however , the spectra in @xmath38 alone also have some interesting features , which we discuss below .    in order to produce sensitivity regions , we use a @xmath77 technique which compares the @xmath77 for oscillations with lv , or lv effects alone , with that for the no - oscillation hypothesis .",
    "we leave the total normalization as a free parameter so that our results are not affected by the normalization of the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "sensitivity regions at both the 90 and 99 percent confidence level are produced .",
    "although our analysis is independent of the normalization of the atmospheric neutrino flux , in order to produce spectra based on the number of observed events , some normalization is necessary . for standard oscillations with no lv effects , bins at high @xmath69",
    "can be used to normalize the flux as standard oscillations become negligible here . however , since all our lv models are proportional to positive powers of the neutrino energy , lv effects are significant at high energies but negligible at low energies , and thus low @xmath69 . in this case",
    ", we use the low @xmath69 bins to normalize the flux .    in our simulations , we consider cases where @xmath36 is zero , so neutrino oscillations arise due to lv effects only , and where @xmath36 is non - zero , so that the lv effects modify standard neutrino oscillations . in the case when @xmath78 is non - zero , we also allow this parameter to vary in order to check whether the experimental point of best fit lies inside our sensitivity regions . in this case , we have three parameters , @xmath36 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we therefore obtain a three dimensional sensitivity region at 90 and 99% confidence levels . in order to consider the details of the sensitivity region , we plot the boundaries of the projection of the surface bounding this volume onto the coordinate planes , thus obtaining three distinct plots .",
    "in addition to data based on the total number of observed events , the spectra of these events , typically in @xmath69 , is also important .",
    "for example , spectral analysis has been performed for super - kamiokande @xcite , kamland @xcite and k2k @xcite .",
    "in addition to being used in the construction of sensitivity regions , the spectra themselves are also important for bounding the size of possible lv effects and possibly ruling effects out due to the observed shape of the spectra .",

    "[ lvsim : fig : lvsensen=1 ] shows the sensitivity contour for the @xmath45 as a function of the mixing angle , @xmath28 .",
    "again , @xmath88 is in this region , and so standard oscillations with no lv effects are also included , with an upper limit shown in table [ lvsim : tab : diagbounds ] .",
    "this is the same order of magnitude as the upper bound from super - kamiokande and k2k data @xcite so it seems unlikely that antares will be able to significantly improve on current data .",
    "we have performed a similar analysis for the model lv2 , when the lv effects are proportional to the neutrino energy squared .",
    "the sensitivity regions for the cases where oscillations are due to lv effects only , and where standard oscillations are modified by lv effects , are very similar in shape to those shown in figs .",
    "[ lvsim : fig : lvsenselv1 ] and [ lvsim : fig : lvsensen=1 ] respectively . in particular , the experimental best - fit point shown by a triangle in fig .",
    "[ lvsim : fig : lvsensen=1 ] again lies within the sensitivity region when standard oscillations are modified by lv effects . in this case",
    ", the sensitivity region again extends to both @xmath42 and @xmath88 .",

    "if we set @xmath42 , so that oscillations are due to lv effects only , then we find that we are unable to derive any meaningful sensitivity contours , so we do not consider this possibility further . for @xmath89 ,",

    "[ lvsim : fig : lvsensen=3 ] .     with no lv effects @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=257 ]   with no lv effects @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=257 ]   with no lv effects @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=257 ]    the sensitivity contours in this case have a rather simpler shape than in models lv1 and lv2 . again the experimental point of best fit is included in the sensitivity region but in this case , @xmath42 is not included , so it seems that we are not sensitive to the case when oscillations arise from lv effects only for this energy dependence .",
    "this is in direct agreement with the first part of our analysis as we were unable to find any meaningful results for this model when we considered lv effects only .",
    "we note however that @xmath88 is contained in the sensitivity region . the upper bound on @xmath45 in this sensitivity region",
    "is given in table [ lvsim : tab : diagbounds ] .",
    "we have shown that neutrino telescopes , such as antares , will be able to place stringent bounds on lv parameters which modify the dispersion relation for massive neutrinos .",
    "table [ lvsim : tab : diagbounds ] shows the upper bounds for this model for the various energy dependences we have studied .",
    "we found that if the lv effects were proportional to either the neutrino energy or the neutrino energy squared , then we are sensitive to oscillations induced from these effects only , with no contributions from standard oscillations .",
    "however , for the case of @xmath48 , then we can not measure the effects of lv only in atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "for all values of @xmath50 studied , we have been able to produce sensitivity curves for standard atmospheric neutrino oscillations modified by subdominant lv effects .",
    "we should stress that although our simulations are based on the antares neutrino telescope , we expect that other neutrino telescopes , such as amanda and icecube , will also be able to probe these models .    from a naturalness perspective",
    ", we would expect any lv effects to be suppressed by the planck mass , @xmath90 gev . since our lv parameters @xmath45 contain powers of the planck mass already , this gives @xmath91 ev@xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "these values are also given in table [ lvsim : tab : diagbounds ] for comparison .",
    "we note that for the case @xmath46 , the bounds obtained from our simulations surpass the expected value of the lv parameter by seven orders of magnitude and so antares may be able to observe these effects or rule out this model . for the case",
    "@xmath48 , however , the bound from our simulations is nine orders of magnitude larger than expected and so we can not rule out this model using atmospheric neutrinos . in this case better sensitivity can be obtained using higher - energy , astrophysical neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the situation is somewhat more complicated if @xmath44 as this corresponds to @xmath63 in ( [ lvtheory : eqn : parmoddisp ] ) and so we have no indication as to the value of @xmath34 except to say that it should be small . in all three cases",
    ", we can see from table [ lvsim : tab : diagbounds ] that our estimates based on the values of the lv parameters at which lv effects become comparable to standard neutrino oscillations are very similar to the upper bounds we find from our sensitivity curves .",
    "our results for the case @xmath44 are comparable with the model investigated in @xcite with super - kamiokande and k2k data .",
    "we find that we are not able to significantly improve on their results ; however an analysis of atmospheric neutrino data from antares should be able to confirm their upper bounds .",
    "although in a rather different lv model , our results are also comparable in magnitude to those found by the macro collaboration @xcite . in that paper , the argument of the sine term in the oscillation probability is identical to that considered here and they found an upper bound on @xmath94 in the range @xmath95 , similar to that found here and shown in table [ lvsim : tab : diagbounds ] .",
    "our results are also comparable to those found in @xcite using data from the amanda experiment . there ,",
    "an upper bound of @xmath96 was placed on the lv parameter .    in @xcite , we studied in depth the spectra of numbers of events for standard atmospheric neutrino oscillations with quantum decoherence .",
    "those spectra had some of the same key features as the ones presented here in figs .",
    "[ lvsim : fig : lvspectralvn=1]-[lvsim : fig : lvspectran=2 ] , in particular , a suppression in the expected number of atmospheric neutrino events observed by antares .",
    "the shape of the spectra do have some differences , but it remains to be seen whether they will really be distinguishable experimentally . at this point , in the absence of real data , one can only speculate on what might be observed , but one can foresee two possibilities .",
    "firstly , it may be that antares ( or any other neutrino telescope ) does not observe any distinguishable difference in numbers of events compared with the standard atmospheric neutrino oscillation model .",
    "we argued in @xcite that such a null observation would be able to place very stringent bounds on quantum decoherence effects , and we draw the same conclusion here from our event spectra .",
    "secondly , it may be the case that antares or an equivalent neutrino telescope does indeed find evidence for a suppression in the number of events compared with the standard picture .",
    "in this situation it is likely to be very challenging experimentally to disentangle the possible source of new physics .",
