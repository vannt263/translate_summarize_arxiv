    "this regime is characterized by an appreciable amount of multiple pair creation events and most conveniently described by recalling the notion of squeezing @xcite .",
    "single or two - mode squeezing described in textbooks can be used to describe realistic multimode parametric amplifier @xcite and it turns out that a laboratory device produces a superposition of squeezed states in modes defined both by the nonlinear medium and the pump pulse .",
    "high - gain parametric amplifiers are nowadays also frequently used for amplification of ultrashort pulses @xcite . in this application",
    "the parametric fluorescence is an important and troublesome source of noise .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the average angular and spectral intensity of a spontaneous parametric fluorescence .",
    "since parametric fluorescence has quantum origin , its intensity can not be calculated using classical nonlinear optics .",
    "below , we adopt both perturbative and stochastic approach for this task . with a few approximations we provide a simple formula for the intensity of the fluorescence in single - pair generation regime .",
    "numerical simulations show , that it qualitatively reproduces main features of the donwnconversion spectrum in the high gain regime as well .",
    "our results could be used as guidelines for constructing brighter photon - pair sources .",
    "other application would be optimization of high - gain parametric amplifiers for a minimal contribution of parametric fluorescence @xcite .",
    "let us mention that a process analogous to parametric down - conversion is observed in physics of cold atoms .",
    "when a pair bose - einstein condensates collide , a halo of spontaneously scattered of atoms is observed @xcite .",
    "stochastic methods used for description of this process proved extremely successful @xcite and we adopted them to obtain results presented below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we recall some basics of the theory of the parametric down - conversion . in section iii ,",
    "we calculate the photon flux in the perturbative regime . in section iv",

    "let s consider a regime in which the pump consists of intense pulses described by a classical envelope @xmath14 in the frequency domain , spanned by @xmath15 .",
    "the evolution of the pump pulse @xmath14 along @xmath1 is determined by the dispersion relation of the crystal . a nonlinear interaction with the fluorescence field",
    "can be neglected , since the intensity of the pumping field is large and its depletion due to parametric down conversion is minimal .",
    "this condition is readily satisfied in many experiments .",
    "note that the intensity of the pump is also assumed large enough to neglect any quantum fluctuations and describe it by a classical field .    for a pump propagating as an @xmath12-ray in a crystal cut at an angle @xmath16 to the @xmath1-axis",

    "in this section we discuss the properties of the average intensity of the parametric fluorescence calculated in the first order approximation with respect to the strength of the nonlinearity @xmath46 .",
    "this approximation physically corresponds to a situation when the fluorescence field consists of a single or a few pairs of photons emitted into distinct frequency or angular regions .",
    "it is expected that as soon as the pump becomes so intense that the photons are emitted in bunches , perturbative expansion fails . however , as we show , some results inferred from the perturbative approach , can be directly applied even in the high - gain regime .",
