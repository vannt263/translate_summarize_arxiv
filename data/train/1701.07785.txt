    "there is wide agreement in logic and philosophy that the indicative conditional of natural language , _ if a then b _ , can not be adequately represented as the material conditional of binary logic , logically equivalent to @xmath6 ( _ not-@xmath2 or @xmath1 _ ) @xcite .",
    "psychological studies have also shown that ordinary people do not judge the probability of @xmath7 , @xmath0 , to be the probability of the material conditional , @xmath8 , but rather tend to assess it as the conditional probability of @xmath1 given @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or at least to converge on this assessment @xcite .",
    "these psychological results have been taken to imply @xcite , that @xmath7 is best represented , either as the probability conditional of adams @xcite , or as the _ conditional event _",
    "@xmath5 of de finetti @xcite , the probability of which is @xmath9 .",
    "we will here adopt the latter view and base our analysis on conditional events and coherence ( for analyses on categorical syllogisms and the square of opposition under coherence see @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath5 is defined as a three - valued logical entity which is _ true _ if @xmath11 ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) is true , _ false _ if @xmath13 is true , and _ void _ if @xmath2 is false .    in the above and what follows , we use the same symbols , for instance @xmath2 , to refer to the ( unconditional ) event @xmath2 and its indicator .",
    "one possible objection to holding that @xmath14 is that it is supposedly unclear how this relation extends to compounds of conditionals and makes sense of them @xcite .",
    "yet consider : @xmath15 the above conjunction appears to make sense , as does the following seemingly even more complex conditional construction @xcite : @xmath16 we will show below , in reply to the objection , how to give sense to  ( [ s : motherprem ] ) and  ( [ s : motherconcl ] ) in terms of _ compound conditionals_. specifically , we will interpret  ( [ s : motherprem ] ) as a _ conjunction _ of two conditionals ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) and  ( [ s : motherconcl ] ) in terms of a _",
    "conditional _ whose antecedent ( @xmath17 ) and consequent ( @xmath18 ) are both conditionals ( if @xmath17 , then @xmath18 ) .",
    "but we note first that  ( [ s : motherconcl ] ) validly follows from  ( [ s : motherprem ] ) by the form of inference we will call _ centering _ ( which is often termed `` conjunctive sufficiency '' ) @xcite , when this is extended to compounds of conditionals ( see section  [ sec : centering ] below ) .",
    "we point out that our framework is quantitative rather than a logical one .",
    "indeed in our approach , syntactically conjoined and iterated conditionals in natural language are analyzed as conditional random quantities , which can sometimes reduce to conditional events , given logical dependencies ( @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , the biconditional event @xmath19 , which we will define by @xmath20 , reduces to the conditional @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the notion of _ biconditional centering _ will be given .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : basicnotions ] we give some basic notions of coherence and entailment for conditional random quantities , which assume values in @xmath22 $ ] . in section  [ sec : centering ] , after recalling the notions of conjoined conditional and iterated conditional , we study the p - validity of centering in the case where the basic events are replaced by conditionals . in section  [ sec : lubounds2premsisecentering ] we give some results on coherence , by determining the lower and upper bounds for the conclusion of the two - premise centering ; we also examine the classical case by obtaining the same lower and upper bounds . in section  [ sec : bicond ] , after recalling the classical biconditional introduction rule , we present an analogue in terms of conditional events ( _ biconditional and rule _ ) ; we also obtain the one - premise and two - premise biconditional centering . in section  [ sec : luboundstwoprembiconcent ]",
    "we determine the lower and upper bounds for the conclusion of the two - premise biconditional centering . in section  [ sec : reversedinferences ] we investigate reversed inferences ( i.e. , inferences from the conclusion to its premises ) , by determining the lower and upper bounds for the premises of the biconditional and rule . in section  [ sec : counterfactuals ] we point out an interesting relation between centering and the semantics of counterfactuals . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] the paper concludes with some remarks on future work .",

    "counterfactuals are important for causal reasoning and for hypothetical thinking in general .",
    "there is experimental evidence that people judge the probability of a counterfactual , `` if @xmath2 were the case , then @xmath386 would be the case '' , as the conditional probability , @xmath388 @xcite .",
    "moreover , when presented with causal , e.g. , `` if a patient were to take certain drug , the symptoms would diminish '' , or non - causal task material , e.g. , `` if the card were to show a square , it would be black '' , people judge the negations of the antecedents to be irrelevant to the evaluation of the counterfactuals @xcite .",
    "these negations state the actual facts , e.g. , `` the patient does not take the drug '' , or `` the side does not show a square '' , respectively .",
    "this speaks for the psychological plausibility of our basic intuition , which also underlies stalnaker s extension of the ramsey test to counterfactuals @xcite : when we evaluate the counterfactual `` if @xmath2 were the case , @xmath386 would be the case '' , we hypothetically remove , or set aside , our information that a is false from our stock of belief and assess @xmath386 under the assumption that @xmath2 is true .",
    "this matches the psychological data . in this section",
    "we formalise this intuition by presenting a new interpretation of counterfactuals in terms of compound conditionals . specifically , we will formalise the described situation by @xmath389 ( where @xmath1 implies that @xmath2 is false ) .",
    "this is an instance of the two premise - centering where the unconditional events are not logically independent @xmath390 . here",

    "we consider the sentence `` if @xmath1 then ( if @xmath2 then @xmath386 ) '' , or equivalently `` ( if @xmath2 then @xmath386 ) when @xmath1 '' .",

    "we obtain @xmath402=\\mathbb{p}[(c|a)|b]p(b)$ ] and then , by assuming @xmath403 , as @xmath1 and @xmath400 are uncorrelated it follows @xmath404=\\frac{\\mathbb{p}[b\\wedge ( c|a)]}{p(b)}=\\frac{p(c|a)p(b)}{p(b)}=p(c|a)\\,.\\ ] ] we point out that equation ( [ eq : incomp ] ) holds in general , even if @xmath405 .",
    "indeed ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 1 ) ) by definition [ iter - cond ] , @xmath406 , moreover , _ conditionally on @xmath1 being true _ , @xmath2 is false , then @xmath407 ; that is @xmath400 is constant and equal to @xmath376 . then , by coherence ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 1 ) ) , @xmath408=\\pr[(ac+y{\\widebar{a}})|b ] = \\pr(y|b)= y$ ] . in conclusion ,",
    "when @xmath393 , the prevision of `` ( if @xmath2 then @xmath386 ) when b '' coincides with the probability of `` ( if @xmath2 then @xmath386 ) '' .",
    "finally , we notice that , if the import principle ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) were valid , we would have @xmath409 .",
    "however , @xmath410 is _ undefined _ in our approach .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a probabilistic analysis of the conjunction and iteration of conditional events , and of the centering inference for these conjunctions and iterations .",
    "we see this account as relevant to the conjunction and iteration of conditionals in natural language . the conditional probability hypothesis for natural language conditionals , that @xmath411 , is fundamental for the new bayesian and probabilistic approaches in the psychology of reasoning , which have confirmed that @xmath411 for a wide range of conditionals ( @xcite ) .",
    "this identity is also central to our analysis of both indicative and counterfactual conditionals as conditional events .",
    "it is often argued that there are deep differences between indicative and counterfactual conditionals .",
    "for example , the indicative conditional , `` if oswald did not kill kennedy then someone else did '' , is not equivalent to the counterfactual conditional , `` if oswald had not killed kennedy then someone else would have '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , indicative conditionals and counterfactuals in our account share a formal property : centering is p - valid for both .",
    "they might still differ in other basic respects , especially in relation to causation ( @xcite ) and we will explore in future work the more detailed similarities and differences between these two forms of the conditional .",
