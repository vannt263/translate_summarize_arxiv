    "cygnus x-2 is a persistent x - ray binary with a long orbital period ( @xmath9  d , cowley , crampton & hutchings 1979 ) .",
    "the observation of unambiguous type i x - ray bursts ( smale , 1998 ) shows that the accreting component is a neutron star rather than a black hole .",
    "the precise spectroscopic information found by casares , charles & kuulkers ( 1998 ) , and the parameters which can be derived from it , is summarized in table 1 .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath10 implies that mass transfer widens the system , and is therefore probably driven by expansion of the secondary star .",
    "normally in long - period low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) this occurs because of the nuclear evolution of a subgiant secondary along the hayashi line , with typical effective temperatures @xmath11  k. however casares et al.s observations show that this can not be the case for cygnus x-2 .",
    "the secondary is in the hertzsprung gap ( spectral type a9 iii ) : use of roche geometry and the stefan  boltzmann law gives @xmath12 with @xmath13  k ( see table 1 ) .",
    "moreover the mass ratio @xmath14 , and the assumption that the primary is a neutron star and thus obeys @xmath15 , implies that the secondary has a low mass ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "in contrast , an isolated a9 iii star would have a mass of about @xmath17 .",
    "more recently orosz & kuulkers ( 1998 ) have modelled the ellipsoidal variations of the secondary and thereby derived a model - dependent inclination of @xmath18 which translates into component masses @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in this paper we consider explanations for the unusual nature of the secondary in cygnus x-2 .",
    "we find only one viable possibility , namely that this star is currently close to the end of early massive case b mass transfer , and thus that the neutron star has somehow managed to reject most of the mass ( @xmath3 ) transferred to it in the past . in support of this idea ,",
    "we show that this type of evolution naturally explains the surprisingly large companion masses in several millisecond pulsar binaries .    .observed and derived properties of cygnus x-2 . [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the initial system in each case consists of a neutron star ( mass @xmath21 ) a donor at the onset of massive case b evolution ( mass @xmath22 , core mass @xmath23 ) . in the upper half of the table mass transfer",
    "is assumed to start when the donor reaches the schnberg  chandrasekhar limit , corresponding to the minimum possible orbital separation . in the lower half of the table mass transfer",
    "is assumed to start only when the donor has reached the hayashi line , corresponding to the maximum possible orbital separation .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 .",
    "we note finally that all of the pulsars of table 3 have spin periods much longer than their likely equilibrium periods ( i.e. they lie far from the ` spinup line ' , cf bhattacharya & van den heuvel , 1991 ) , suggesting that they have accreted very little mass ( @xmath25 ) during their evolution .",
    "this agrees with our proposal that these systems are the direct outcome of a super  eddington mass transfer phase in which almost all the transferred mass is ejected .",
    "the distance to cygnus x-2 derived from the observations of type i x - ray bursts ( smale 1989 ) is @xmath26  kpc . from",
    "the galactic coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 and the solar galactocentric distance @xmath29  kpc one derives a galactocentric distance for cygnus x-2 of @xmath30  kpc and a distance from the galactic plane of @xmath31  kpc .",
    "thus cygnus x-2 has a very peculiar position indeed , being not only in the halo but also in the very outskirts of our galaxy .",
    "but not only is its position peculiar , its space velocity with respect to the galactic centre is also surprising .",
    "it can be shown that the observed heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath32 km  s@xmath33 ( casares et al .",
    "1998 ) is totally incompatible with prograde rotation on a circular , even inclined orbit around the galactic centre ( kolb et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the orbit is either highly eccentric and/or retrograde . in either case cygnus x-2",
    "must have undergone a major kick in the past , presumably when the neutron star was formed in a type ii supernova . since prior to the supernova explosion the primary was much more massive ( @xmath34 ) than the secondary ( @xmath35 ) , the latter was still on the main sequence when the supernova exploded .",
    "thus the age of cygnus x-2 ( and the time elapsed since the supernova ) is well approximated by the nuclear time - scale of the secondary , which is @xmath36  yr for a @xmath37 star .",
    "this means that cygnus x-2 must have gone around the galactic center a few times since its birth or supernova explosion and that , therefore , its birthplace in the galaxy can not be inferred from its current position and velocity .",
    "we have shown that the unusual nature of the secondary star in cygnus x-2 can be understood if the system is near the end of a phase of early massive case b evolution in which almost all of the transferred material is ejected .",
    "the system is unusual in having had an initial mass ratio @xmath38 in a narrow critical range near @xmath39 ; smaller ratios lead to detached systems with the secondary near the hayashi line , and larger ratios produce binary pulsars with fairly short orbital periods and relatively massive white dwarf companions . during this evolution ,",
    "much of the companion s original mass ( @xmath40 for cygnus x-2 ) is transferred and consequently lost on the thermal time - scale @xmath5  yr of this star .",
    "evidently the huge mass loss rate and the short duration of this phase make it difficult to detect any systems in this state ; they would probably resemble wolf ",
    "rayet stars of the wne type ( i.e. showing hydrogen ) .",
    "cygnus x-2 is currently near the end of the thermal time scale mass transfer phase , so that its mass transfer rate is now well below the thermal time - scale value , and probably given by the accretion rate . at @xmath41 yr@xmath33 ( smale , 1998 ) ,",
    "this is nevertheless one of the highest in any lmxb , making it easily detectable .",
    "only a full calculation of the evolution , with in particular a detailed model for the secondary , can predict the duration of the current phase ; this is not any easy task , as this star deviates strongly from thermal equilibrium during most of the evolution . but",
    "it is clear that the mass transfer rate will decline as the remaining few tenths of a solar mass in the hydrogen envelope are transferred .",
    "cygnus x-2 s long orbital period and large accretion disc mean that even its current mass transfer rate only slightly exceeds the critical value required for a persistent rather than a transient lmxb ( cf .",
    "king , kolb & burderi 1996 ) , so the system will eventually become transient .",
    "once the envelope has been transferred , mass transfer will stop , and the system will become a pulsar binary with about the current orbital period @xmath42  d , and a white dwarf companion with a mass which is slightly higher than that of the companion s present helium core . clearly since the present core mass is at least @xmath43 this @xmath44 combination will not obey the hayashi - line relation ( [ h ] ) , so cygnus x-2 will become another ` discrepant ' system like those in table 3 .",
    "the reasoning of the last paragraph shows that cygnus x-2 will cease to be a persistent x - ray binary within the current mass transfer time - scale @xmath45  yr .",
    "its past lifetime as a persistent source before the current epoch , and its future one as a detectable transient after it , are both likely to be of a similar order , although full evolutionary calculations are required to check this . the fact that we nevertheless observe even one system like",
    "cygnus x-2 strongly suggests that the birthrate of such systems must be relatively high , i.e. @xmath46  yr@xmath33 in the galaxy . since the binary pulsar end - products of these systems have enormously long lifetimes",
    ", this may suggest that systems like cygnus x-2 play a very important role in providing the galactic population of millisecond pulsars .",
    "cygnus x-2 thus fits naturally into a unified description of long - period lmxbs in which super  eddington case b mass transfer is efficiently ejected by the neutron star . while the ejection process can already be inferred for the formation history of hayashi - line lmxbs resulting from low - mass case b evolution ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel , 1991 ; kalogera & webbink , 1996 ) , cygnus x-2 supplies the most powerful evidence that this process must occur .",
    "the work of section 2 shows that it is very hard otherwise to reconcile the rather low current mass ( @xmath47 ) of the secondary with its large radius ( @xmath1 ) and high luminosity ( @xmath2 ) . from section 4",
    "we see that the orbital period @xmath9  d is far too long for the system to be the product of common - envelope evolution , leaving no realistic alternative for driving the required mass ejection .",

    "in section 2.2 we considered a stripped subgiant model for cyg x2 , and asserted that the observed orbital modulation of the optical flux ( @xmath48  mag ) would require an extremely low inclination if one appeals to x  ray heating of the companion to raise its observed effective temperature to 7330  k. here we justify this claim .",
    "we consider a simple picture in which the hemisphere of the ( spherical ) companion facing the neutron star has effective temperature 7330  k , while the other hemisphere has the hayashi  line effective temperature 4100  k. we consider the effect of relaxing these assumptions below . then viewing the heated face at the most favourable phase the observer sees hot and cool areas @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the inclination in radians , with the two expressions reversing at the least favourable phase . neglecting limb  darkening , the ratio of maximum to minimum flux is = ( 1/2 + i/)b_hot + ( 1/2 - i/)b_cool(1/2 + i/)b_cool + ( 1/2 - i/)b_hot , [ a1 ] where @xmath51 are the optical surface brightnesses of the hot and cool regions respectively . approximating these by planck functions at @xmath52 , we find @xmath53",
    ". requiring @xmath54 ( @xmath55  mag ) in ( [ a1 ] ) shows that @xmath56 , or @xmath57 , as used in section 2.2    in reality the heated region would be smaller than a hemisphere , and its temperature higher than 7330  k in order to produce an average observed temperature of this value . however relaxing these limits clearly requires even smaller inclinations than the estimate above , because the contrast in optical surface brightness between the hot and cool regions would be even larger than the ratio @xmath58 we found above ."
