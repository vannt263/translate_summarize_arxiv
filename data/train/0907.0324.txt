    ", while the other , after the initial motion , comes to rest . during the initial period of separation both of the skyrmions energy densities",
    "are seen to oscillate .",
    "this oscillation continues until the skyrmions reach a critical distance of separation , where it ceases .",
    "these oscillations surface again after the skyrmion is reflected from the boundary , when it has reached another critical distance from the stationary skyrmion .",
    "these oscillations are rather peculiar and the only other system to bear such oscillations is the transition dynamics . in the transition dynamics for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the skyrmions energy densities undergo violent oscillations .",
    "these oscillations are the result of the excitation of one or more of the internal modes of the skyrmions due to the energetics during the skyrmion separation .",
    "we would expect that any of the excited modes would be of the lowest order .",
    "piette et al @xcite have previously undertaken an analysis of the excited modes of the skyrmions of the new baby skyrme model , in the fully relativistic system . in @xcite",
    "the modes of a single skyrmion and a two - skyrmion configuration during a scattering process were analysed",
    ". it would be interesting to see how the excited modes of the skyrmions observed in our simulations compare with the excited modes seen in their work .",
    "one of the most interesting observations of our simulations was the apparent non - conservation of the total angular momentum @xmath31 ( given its usual definition ) .",
    "this non - conservation of @xmath31 was due to the non - conservation of the orbital angular momentum , @xmath29 , as we have found that in all of the simulations the total magnetization in the third direction , @xmath30 , was well conserved in time . at the same time we showed that @xmath105 . thinking about this further we showed that when a system involves potential obstructions , these obstructions made a significant contribution to @xmath64 .",
    "hence one has to modify the conventional definition of @xmath29 .",
    "we have found and calculated this missing contribution . in all of the simulations of the skyrmions in both the symmetric and asymmetric systems",
    "we have shown that the addition of the contribution from the obstructions compensates @xmath64 .",
    "this results in the overall conservation of @xmath29 and @xmath31 for the full system .",
    "however , there were a few systems studied that did nt adhere to the above statement . in the transition dynamics in the asymmetric system",
    ", there were regions where the angular momentum due to the fields , @xmath74 , and the angular momentum due to the obstruction , @xmath85 , did not sufficiently cancel each other out , in order for total angular momentum conservation .",
    "however , when comparing the size for which @xmath106 in such regions with the total angular momentum as a whole , these regions of non - conservation are brief and the magnitude in most of the cases is small . in some systems , where the non - conservation of @xmath31 was larger , we noted that this was due to boundary effects .",
    "an examination of the times when there was an appreciable discrepancy in @xmath107 , provided a direct link between the skyrmion oscillations and the non - conservation of @xmath31 . initially @xmath31 is well conserved but as the oscillations begin to increase this conservation is destroyed .",
    "there reaches a point when the @xmath31 conservation is restored .",
    "it is at these points that the skyrmion oscillations have ceased . in many of the cases these oscillations",
    "reappear again and again during the skyrmions dynamics and each time the conservation of @xmath31 is destroyed .",
    "the size of the oscillation and the magnitude to which @xmath106 are also correlated . in the transition dynamics",
    "the large spike observed in the @xmath108 plot of @xmath109 system corresponds to the violent oscillation during the dynamics of the skyrmions .",
    "conversely in the system with @xmath110 smaller oscillation are apparent in that system , resulting in a smaller spike in @xmath109 .",
    "the regions where @xmath94 suggest that the inclusion of an additional term is required for the overall exact conservation of the total angular momentum , @xmath31 , for skyrmion scattering in a landau - lifshitz model .",
    "any term or terms that are included must have a direct correspondence with the oscillations of the skyrmions observed in these systems .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to solve ( [ ll ] ) analytically we have therefore had to study this problem numerically . the fields and their derivatives",
    "were discretised in the usual manner and were placed on a lattice of @xmath111 points , with lattice spacing @xmath112 .",
    "the numerical integration of the 3-coupled differential equations of ( [ ll ] ) involved the use of a @xmath113 order runge - kutta method of simulating time evolution with a time step of @xmath114 .",
    "the various integrals calculated throughout the simulations were performed using a 2-d simpson s rule .",
    "the constraint equation requires that the fields lie on the 2-sphere , @xmath115 , and this was imposed at every time step by rescaling each field component so that @xmath116 .",
    "the skyrmions were initially placed at @xmath117 in the upper and lower planes , where d is the distance between the two skyrmion centres @xmath118 .",
    "the trajectory of each skyrmion was tracked by following the maxima of the topological charge density and interpolating between the lattice points .",
    "the coefficients @xmath119 have been set to unity in all the simulations unless stated otherwise .",
