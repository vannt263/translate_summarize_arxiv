    "measuring the mass ( @xmath1 ) and the radius @xmath2 of a neutron star ( ns ) is very important in both nuclear physics and gravitational physics since it allows us to constrain the ns matter compositions ( e.g. neutrons or quarks ) at super - density ( see , e.g. lattimer & prakash 2004 ; miller 2002 ; li et al .",

    "1994 ; bailes et al . 2003 ) .",
    "for example , the masses of the two nss of the hulse - taylor pulsar system , psr 1913 + 16 , have been measured as m=1.41@xmath3 and m=1.38 @xmath3 , respectively ( see , e.g. , manchester & taylor 1977 ) ; and those of the recently discovered double pulsar system , psr j0737 - 3039 , are m=1.34@xmath3 and m=1.25 @xmath3 , respectively ( see , e.g. , lyne et al .",
    ". the mass constraints of 26 neutron stars in the binary radio pulsar systems have been derived by thorsett & chakrabarty ( 1999 ) , who present a remarkably narrow underlying gaussian mass distribution at m=1.35@xmath4 . in the low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs )",
    "a lower mass limit @xmath5 was derived for the ns in 2a 1822 - 371 ( jonker et al 2003 ) , and the ns mass in cyg x-2 was derived as @xmath6 ( orosz & kuulkers 1999 ) .",
    "in contrast , there is no method so far to directly measure the radius of a ns .",
    "a conventional value of ns radius is about 15 km , which is derived by requiring that the averaged dipolar magnetic field strength ( i.e. @xmath7 g ) inferred from radio pulsar spindown ( see , e.g. manchester & taylor 1977 ) is consistent with the one implied by the cyclotron line emission in some x - ray binaries ( see , e.g. makishima et al .",

    "if two of the three above @xmath8 relations are well `` measured '' , one can solve both @xmath1 and @xmath2 independently .",
    "this is the main topic of this paper .",
    "we will discuss the methods in detail and apply them to several sources .",
    "* once ns @xmath1 and @xmath2 known , we can evaluate the matter compositions of star by comparing with the representative eoss , as shown in the three figures we chosen the eoss of strange matter ( cs1 and cs2 ) , normal neutron matter ( cn1 and cn2 ) and pion condensate in the star core ( cpc ) ( see , e.g. lattimer & prakash 2001 ; cook et al . 1994 ) . *",

    "* we stress that the apparent radius is not a directly observable quantity although derivable ( in principle ) from two observable quantities , namely the `` apparent blackbody luminosity '' ( the blackbody luminosity seen by a distant observer ) and the `` apparent blackbody temperature '' .",
    "both quantities are derived by fitting x - ray data under the assumption of perfect blackbody , which is , in general , not true ( see , haensel 2001 ) .",
    "in particular the inclusion of an atmosphere above the ns crust can vary the estimate of the ns apparent radius by more than a factor 2 ( see haensel 2001 , section 3.1 ) , thus the ` measured ' apparent radius is still model dependent . *",
    "\\(2 ) the gravitational redshift near the neutron star surface provides another m - r relation , giving the ratio between the ns mass and the ns radius ( e.g. miller 2002 ) .",
    "the approach becomes relevant with the recent discovery of the absorption features in exo 0748 - 676 ( cottam et al .",
    "according to the definition of the gravitation redshift @xmath13 ( for a weak gravitational field , where @xmath14 is the wavelength of the emission ) , for a non - rotating spherical gravitational source in the schwarzschild spacetime , we get ( see , e.g. , sanwal et al .",

    ", @xmath19 is approximately obtained .",
    "\\(3 ) a third @xmath8 relation can be obtained by analyzing the kilohertz quasi periodic oscillation ( khz qpo ) data .",
    "this field has been greatly benefited from the rxte mission , which discovered the twin ( upper and lower ) khz qpos or millisecond variability in the x - ray data of about 20 ns lmxb systems .",
    "the upper khz qpo frequency is generally interpreted as the keplerian frequency @xmath20 of orbital materials at some preferred radius @xmath21 near the ns surface ( van der klis 2000 , 2006 ; morsink 2000 ; stella & vietri 1999 ; zhang 2004 ) , i.e. , = = 1850   ( hz ) ax^3/2 , x = r / r , [ nt ] with the parameter @xmath22 or @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the ns radius in unit of 10 km .",
    "the physical meaning of the parameter a is such that the quantity @xmath25 represents the  measurement \" of the averaged ns mass density , namely , .",
    "[ mr ]    meanwhile , by interpreting the twin khz qpos as the keplerian motion and the alfvn wave oscillation mechanism ( see , e.g. , zhang 2004 ) , the averaged mass density parameter a can be inferred from the simultaneously detected twin khz qpo frequencies . for typical khz qpo sources , @xmath26",
    "is approximately obtained .",
    "if , instead , only one single khz qpo frequency is detected , one can not derive the exact value of @xmath27 from the model , but can estimate the lower limit of @xmath27 and the upper limit of @xmath1 according to the following arguments , as proposed by miller et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in order to explain the observed x - ray flux saturation at the twin khz qpo frequencies (",
    "e.g. van der klis 2000 , 2006 ; zhang et al . 1998 ) , it is usually believed that the maximum keplerian frequency @xmath20 occurs either at the star surface ( @xmath28 : @xmath29 ) or at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) with the radius @xmath30 .",
    "the two inequalities are therefore derived from eq.([nt ] ) of miller et al ( 1998 ) , i.e. a /1850 ( hz),[a ] and",
    "[ mass2 ] in addition , burderi & king ( 1998 ) have derived a @xmath8 relation for the millisecond accretion - powered x - ray pulsar sax j 1808.4 - 3658 with the measured spin frequency 401 hz through comparing the stellar radius with its co - rotation radius of the magnetosphere - disk .",
    "they inferred a value of @xmath31 .    to summarize ,",
    "hitherto there are roughly three kinds of well - known @xmath8 relationships that could be measured or estimated from the data , as described above . knowing two of the three in a system",
    "would in principle lead to the determination of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in reality , errors are large for these relationships . knowing all three relations for a source would greatly diminish the errors . as an illustration , below",

    "if we take the cooler component as the emission from the whole star , then the cooler emitting radius 4.6@xmath380.1 km can be regarded as a measured lower limit of the  apparent radius \" @xmath9 . * in addition , an emitting radius r=@xmath39 km in 1e 1207.4 - 5209 is obtained by the best fitting continuum model of the blackbody function and by the distance of @xmath40 ( bignami et al .",
    "2004 ) , however as claimed by haensel ( 2001 ) that an emitting radius may be doubled if the atmosphere model of the photon spectrum is considered , i.e. the emitting radius may be as high as @xmath419.4 km .",
    "*    on the other hand , two absorption features in the spectrum of 1e 1207.4 - 5209 were detected with the _ chandra _ acis ( sanwal et al .",

    "a gravitational redshift is inferred as @xmath42 ( sanwal et al . 2002 ) .",
    "this conclusion is , however , inconclusive , since the lines may be due to the cyclotron origin ( e.g. de luca et al .",

    "we take this gravitational redshift measurement as an unconfirmed , tentative case .    * in figure [ iz ] , we present the @xmath8 diagram of nss with various eoss and present the above two @xmath8 constraints in the same plot . for the possible parameter ranges of @xmath9 and @xmath43 ,",

    "the latter corresponds @xmath50 ( this value is fortuitous coincidence with the observationally inferred redshift upper limit of 1e1207.4 - 5209 , see sanwal et al . 2002 ) and divides the @xmath8 diagram into the @xmath51 region ( above the line ) and the @xmath52 region ( below the line ) . from figure [ iz ]",
    "the inferred @xmath8 value regime for 1e1207.4 - 5209 favors the existence of the exotic matter inside ns .",

    "if we consider the atmosphere model of photon spectrum and the distance @xmath55 , then the derived  apparent radius \" can be as large as @xmath56 ( 4.6 * 2 * 3.9/2=18 ) , which will weaken the conclusion of 1e 1207.4 - 5209 including a strange star because the inferred @xmath8 range in figure [ iz ] is enlarged to cover the eoss of normal neutrons .",
