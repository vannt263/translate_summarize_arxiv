    "one - dimensional traveling nonlinear waves in dispersiveless systems are called riemann or simple waves ; their dynamics is well studied in various physical media , e.g. acoustic waves in the compressible fluids and gases @xcite , surface and internal waves in oceans @xcite , tidal and tsunami waves in rivers @xcite , ion- and magneto - sound waves in plasmas @xcite , electromagnetic waves in transmission lines @xcite , and optical tsunami in fiber optics @xcite . in homogeneous and stationary media ,",
    "the riemann waves continuously deform and transform to the shock waves yielding breaking in a finite time .    in nonlinear acoustics where the wave intensity is not very high ,",
    "the nonlinear deformation of the riemann wave has been studied in many details since this stage occurs during many wavelengths @xcite .",
    "corresponding nonlinear evolution equation is a so - called simple wave equation [ e1 ] u_t+v(u ) u_x = 0 , where @xmath4 is a wave function , and @xmath5 is a characteristic local velocity of the various points of the wave shape . if @xmath6 for all @xmath4 ( that is , if @xmath7 is invertible ) , equation ( [ e1 ] ) can be written for the local velocity : [ e19 ] v_t + v v_x = 0 , which is equivalent to the inviscid burgers equation [ e2 ] v_t + v v_x = 0 , v : = v(u ) .",
    "the cauchy problem for equation ( [ e2 ] ) starts with the initial condition given by a smooth function that decays to zero at infinity : [ e3 ] v(x,0 ) = f(x ) , _",
    "|x| f(x ) = 0 , and results in the implicit solution called a simple or riemann wave : [ e4 ] v(x , t ) = f(x - t v(x , t ) ) .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of these solutions near the breaking time @xmath0 .",
    "the appearance of the singularity in the wave shape yields a power law in the fourier spectrum of wave turbulence @xcite .",
    "it was argued earlier in @xcite that for simple ( riemann ) waves this singularity is of the form @xmath8 ; this corresponds to the spectrum of spatial amplitudes decaying at the breaking time as @xmath9 , with corresponding energy spectrum decaying as @xmath10 .",
    "however , we will show that this assumption is in fact incorrect and the spectrum of spatial amplitudes decays at the breaking time as @xmath1 , with corresponding energy spectrum decaying as @xmath2 , because the simple waves develop singularities of the form @xmath11 .",
    "this analytical result confirms earlier numerical observations in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we note that the wave field in the vicinity of the breaking time was studied by pomeau _",
    "they observed that the wave profile changes as @xmath12 near the breaking time ; to show this , they developed taylor series expansions similar to methods in our paper .",
    "although the result @xmath11 can be derived from the formulas given in @xcite , the authors did not point it explicitly and did not study the fourier spectrum of the breaking riemann wave .",
    "let us now illustrate the wave breaking and the main result with examples .",
    "first , it is easy to see that the wave steepness @xmath13 increases on the wave front where @xmath14 is negative : [ e5 ] v_x = , = x - t v(x , t ) . the breaking time",
    "is computed explicitly as [ e6 ] t_b = =",
    ".    this process is illustrated at fig.[f:1 ] for an initial pulse of the gaussian shape @xmath15 .",
    "the shock is formed at the point @xmath16 and @xmath17 at the moment of time @xmath18 . at the breaking time",
    "the wave shape contains singularity on its front ( i.e. its steepness becomes infinite ) and the solution ( [ e4 ] ) is not valid anymore .",
    "deformation of the riemann wave for the case of quadratic nonlinearity and initial pulse of gaussian shape @xmath19 the wave shape at the moments of time @xmath20 is shown as small dashed , long dashed and bold lines correspondingly.,width=321 ]    if @xmath21 , an analytical solution for the fourier spectrum of the simple waves ( [ e4 ] ) is known . corresponding spectrum is known as the bessel - fubini spectrum and is given in ref .",
    "@xcite : [ e7 ] v(x ,",
    "t)=_n=1^ j_n(n t ) , where @xmath22 is bessel function of the first order with integer @xmath23 and the breaking time is @xmath24 .",
    "the amplitude of the fourier spectrum at the breaking time reads [ e8 ] |a_n|=j_n(n ) and is distributed close to the rate of @xmath25 ( see fig.[f:2 ] ) .",
    "we shall now prove that the power rate of the fourier amplitude spectrum at the time of wave breaking is @xmath1 for a simple ( riemann ) wave supported by an arbitrary smooth initial pulse and an arbitrary local velocity @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the same rate remains valid in the range of small wave numbers if small dissipation or dispersion is added in the framework of the viscous burgers or korteweg  de vries equations .",
    "using the method of characteristics , we write the inviscid burgers equation ( [ e2 ] ) as the system of two ordinary differential equations [ e9 - 10 ] = v(x , t ) , = 0 , therefore , each point on the wave shape moves with velocity proportional to the magnitude of @xmath26 . the solution is now written in the parametric form : [ e11 - 12 ] u(t)=f ( ) , x(t)=+tf ( ) .     amplitude spectrum of riemann waves for the solution ( [ e7 ] ) at the breaking time @xmath24 is shown by blue crosses .",
    "the power rate @xmath25 is shown as the red solid line .",
    "wave number @xmath23 ( horizontal axes ) and the amplitude spectrum @xmath27 ( vertical axes ) are shown in logarithmical coordinates.,width=359 ]    let @xmath28 be the global minimum of @xmath14 ( which always exists since @xmath29 is smooth and decays to zero at infinity ) .",
    "we assume that the minimum is not degenerate , hence , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 be the time of breaking defined by equation ( [ e6 ] ) such that @xmath33 .",
    "the wave breaks at the point @xmath34 and @xmath35 . using the decomposition @xmath36 and expanding the exact solution ( [ e11 - 12 ] ) into taylor",
    "series , we obtain at the time of breaking : [ e15 ] x & = & _ b + + t_b f(_b+ ) + & = & x_b + t_b f(_b ) ^3 + ( ^4 ) and [ e17 ] v(x , t_b ) & = & f(_b+ ) + & = & v_b + f(_b ) + ( ^2 ) .    solving ( [ e15 ] ) for a unique small real root of @xmath37 , we obtain an explicit relation between @xmath4 and @xmath38 at the time of breaking : [ e16 ] ~(x - x_b)^1/3 , v - v_b ~(x - x_b)^1/3 .",
    "therefore , the wave profile changes near the breaking point at the breaking time as @xmath3 , contrary to the behavior @xmath39 suggested in @xcite .",
    "the behavior ( [ e16 ] ) leads to the power spectrum with slope @xmath40 as it was established numerically in @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum in this case has the slope @xmath41 .    if @xmath42 , then @xmath43 since @xmath29 is smooth and @xmath28 is the point of minimum of @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath44 ( in which case @xmath45 ) , then the modification of the previous analysis shows that the wave profile changes near the breaking point at the breaking time as @xmath46 , leading to the power spectrum with slope @xmath47 .",
    "we can continue this analysis if @xmath28 is a degenerate minimum of a higher order .",
    "note that the above analysis holds for a general nonlinear evolution equation ( [ e1 ] ) under the assumption that @xmath6 ( that is , when @xmath7 is invertible ) . in this case , if @xmath48 , the wave field @xmath49 of the nonlinear evolution equation ( [ e1 ] ) changes according to the behavior ( [ e16 ] ) , or explicitly , as [ e20 ] u(x , t_b ) & & v^-1 ( v_b + ( x - x_b)^1/3 ) + & & u_b + ( x - x_b)^1/3 , where @xmath50 is the inverse function to @xmath7 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is a numerical coefficient .",
    "thus , we conclude that the above universal behavior extends to a general nonlinear evolution equation ( [ e1 ] ) and a general initial data ( [ e3 ] ) under some restrictive assumptions that are physically relevant .",
    "the simple wave equation ( [ e1 ] ) is only valid before the moment of breaking ; the study of the wave field evolution at the later times is usually conducted by including effects of dissipation or dispersion .",
    "corresponding terms added to the right hand side of ( [ e1 ] ) produce different types of equations such as the viscous burgers equation [ be ] u_t+ u u_x = u_xx , > 0 and the korteweg - de vries equation [ kdv ] u_t+6 u u_x + u_xxx= 0 . in both cases , we consider the initial - value problem starting with initial data @xmath53",
    ".    taking into account dissipative and dispersive effects will inevitably change the wave spectrum for large wave numbers .",
    "for instance , it is well - known that shock waves in the viscous burgers equation ( [ be ] ) have spectral density that decays as @xmath54 for large wave numbers @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our numerical simulations of the viscous burgers equation ( [ be ] ) demonstrate that universal power @xmath2 of the energy spectrum of breaking riemann waves is clearly visible in the range of small wave numbers at least for the evolution times @xmath55 , where @xmath32 is the breaking time in the inviscid burgers equation . for longer times ,",
    "dissipative effects become fully developed and drift the energy spectrum away from the power @xmath2 .",
    "figures [ f:5 ] and [ f:6 ] illustrate solutions of the viscous burgers equation ( [ be ] ) in physical and fourier space consequently .    similar results of numerical simulations for the korteweg - de vries equation ( [ kdv ] ) are shown in figures [ f:3 ] and [ f:4 ] .",
    "it is clearly visible that although wave breaking is absent in the kdv equation ( [ kdv ] ) , the universal power @xmath2 appear in the energy spectrum for small wave numbers for @xmath55 .",
    "solutions of the burgers equation ( [ be ] ) with @xmath56 and initial data @xmath57 in physical space , for different values of time @xmath58 .",

    "the universal power law @xmath2 is shown by green solid line.,width=283 ]     solutions of the kdv equation ( [ kdv ] ) with initial data @xmath53 in physical space , for different values of time @xmath58",

    "we have justified the universal power law @xmath2 in the energy spectrum of one - dimensional breaking riemann waves in the context of the simple wave equation ( [ e1 ] ) with smooth initial data ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "this result remains valid for arbitrary nonlinear wave speed provided that the wave speed is an invertible function of the wave amplitude . in addition , we have demonstrated that the same power law is observed for long times in the range of small wave numbers in the context of the viscous burgers ( [ be ] ) and korteweg - de vries ( [ kdv ] ) equations .",
    "these universal power law also occurs in other nonlinear evolution equations that reduce to the simple wave equation in the dissipationless and dispersionless limit .",
