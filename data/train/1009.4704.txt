    "the earliest bound , virialized structures arise on small scales , and as time progresses these objects merge and accrete mass , growing ever larger until cosmic acceleration at low redshift freezes out the growth of large - scale structure .    the role played by the earliest generations of collapsed structures in the thermal history of the universe is , at present , unclear . observations of the spectra of high - redshift quasars indicate that the reionization of the intergalactic medium was largely complete by redshift @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while measurements of the thomson scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background suggest that reionization occurred at @xmath5 @xcite . at these epochs , the typical masses of collapsed dark matter halos range from rare @xmath6 objects , down to ( plausibly ) earth - mass halos @xcite .",
    "as we discuss below , the smallest dark matter halos are unable to attract baryons , resulting in an effective lower mass limit near @xmath7",
    ".    even if low - mass halos are able to acquire baryons , they may be unable to convert those baryons into stars @xcite , since star formation requires the presence of cold , dense gas .",
    "objects massive enough to attract gas but whose virial temperatures are below @xmath8 k , termed minihalos , can not cool their gas through atomic lines and must therefore rely upon molecular cooling processes . it is unclear whether molecular processes can cool minihalo gas sufficiently to allow star formation . prior to the formation of the first stars in the universe , the formation of molecular h@xmath9 catalyzed by residual free electrons left over after recombination appears insufficient to allow efficient cooling at redshifts @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "however , feedback from the first luminous objects can change this result .",
    "positive feedback , for example from ionizing x - rays that strip electrons from atoms and thereby spur molecule creation , could lead to efficient cooling .",
    "conversely , negative feedback in the form of ultraviolet radiation in the lyman and werner bands could destroy molecules and suppress h@xmath9 cooling over large volumes @xcite .",
    "given this wide range of possible scenarios , it is unclear whether minihalos can form stars and whether they might be important during the reionization of the intergalactic medium .",
    "this uncertainty , however , may be viewed as an opportunity : any probe that can quantify the importance of minihalos during redshifts preceding and during reionization would dramatically help to elucidate the physics of star formation in the first structures that arise in the universe .    recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter th ) pointed out an important effect governing the formation of @xmath11 minihalos , that had previously been overlooked .",
    "as we discuss below , this effect can provide a minihalo signature in many potential observables .",
    "th noticed that the relative velocity between dark matter and baryons following recombination is typically supersonic .",
    "this relative velocity arises because dark matter is accelerated by gravitational potential gradients , while baryons are jeans stabilized against gravitational collapse due to their tight coupling with the photon radiation field , until recombination .",
    "because dm and baryons suffer different accelerations , they acquire significant relative velocities that are predominantly sourced by potential fluctuations on scales of order the sound horizon at recombination , @xmath12 mpc . at recombination ,",
    "the baryon sound speed and jeans length fall precipitously , allowing baryons to respond to the same gravitational potential wells that accelerate dark matter .",
    "subsequently , the large - scale relative velocity is unsourced and decays as @xmath13 following recombination . at redshifts @xmath14 ,",
    "the relative dm - baryon motion is highly supersonic , with mach numbers @xmath15 .",
    "the gas sound speed does not initially decay as quickly as @xmath13 because of residual thermal coupling to the cmb , so the mach number diminishes over time to @xmath16 at @xmath17 , and remains nearly constant thereafter .",
    "because the relative motions between baryons and dm are supersonic , they have significant effects on the growth of structure .",
    "th computed the effects of relative dm - baryon velocities at high redshift , in the perturbative regime of structure formation .",
    "they showed that these motions cause a @xmath18 suppression of the matter power spectrum at @xmath19 compared to standard linear perturbation theory calculations . using a press - schechter approach ,",
    "th also suggested that the abundance of dark matter halos of mass @xmath20 could be suppressed by a factor of @xmath21 at redshift @xmath22 . at",
    "later redshifts closer to reionization , @xmath23 , the halo abundance would be much closer to standard predictions .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a similar effect of the supersonic relative velocities that th discussed . instead of considering the effect on dark matter halos ,",
    "we examine the impact on baryonic objects , which likely determine the properties of observable quantities like 21 cm absorption , emission , etc .",
    "the supersonic flow changes the mass threshold of baryonically populated halos , and this effect can be exponentially large for rare objects .",
    "the relative bulk flows between dm and baryons are modulated on large scales , of order @xmath24 mpc , meaning that the minihalo abundance is similarly modulated .",
    "this provides a large - scale signature of the effect of minihalos .",

    "the so called kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect , caused by radial doppler motions of electrons off which photons scatter , can be important ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this effect is enhanced if reionization is patchy @xcite .",
    "if these reionization patches have suppressed bulk velocities then the effect will be reduced . on the other hand ,",
    "the large scale correlation of reionization patches predicted here will lead to large scale fluctuations in optical depth , inducing a modulated suppression of primary cmb fluctuations , which may be detectable with a higher order correlation analysis in cmb .    at low redshifts , @xmath157 ,",
    "the typical masses of collapsing halos are generally much larger than minihalo masses , and so we would naively expect the effects of relative velocities between dm and baryons to become unimportant . however , in principle the signatures of minihalos could persist even in late - time observables .",
    "for example , if reionization is patchy on @xmath24 mpc scales due to minihalos , the subsequent star formation history inside patches that reionize early could differ from patches that reionize later .",

    "* ) , which rely on precise determination of the bao feature in the galaxy two - point function .",
    "any contamination from minihalo effects could shift the location of the bao feature and thereby create a bias in measurements of the equation of state parameter @xmath158 , analogous to the results of @xcite . removing this source of systematic uncertainty appears daunting .",
    "@xcite have shown that bao probes of dark energy are quite insensitive to smooth distortions to the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "however , the minihalo effect could be far more pernicious , since the velocity power spectrum is not smooth , but has pronounced baryon oscillations that are presumably out of phase with the oscillations in the matter power spectrum .",
    "marginalizing over an unknown minihalo contaminant could significantly degrade bao constraints on dark energy .",
    "this underscores the need for more work on this subject .    in summary , the supersonic relative motions between baryons and dark matter can dramatically affect the formation of the earliest collapsed baryonic objects in the universe .",
    "we expect the abundance of minihalos of mass @xmath159 to be modulated on @xmath24 mpc scales , and any tracer of minihalos should show the same modulations , with highly pronounced baryon acoustic oscillations .",
