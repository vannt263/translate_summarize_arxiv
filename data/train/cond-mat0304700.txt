    "econophysics aims at introducing statistical physics techniques and physics models in order to improve the understanding of financial and economic matters .",
    "thus when this understanding is established , econophysics might @xmath8 help in the well being of humanity . in so doing several techniques have been developed to analyze the correlations of the fluctuations of stocks or currency exchange rates .",
    "it is of interest to examine cases pertaining to rich or developing economies .    in the first sections of this report we recall the classical technical analysis methods of stock evolution .",
    "we recall the notion of moving averages and ( classical ) momentum .",

    "four countries maintain a currency peg against the @xmath7 .",
    "some private financial instruments are also denominated in @xmath7s.@xcite because of the close connections between the developing countries and the imf , we search for correlations between the fluctuations of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 exchange rates with respect to @xmath7 and the currencies that form this artificial money . in the latest sections of this report , we compare the correlations of such fluctuations as we did in our previous results on @xmath10 exchange rates fluctuations with respect to @xmath6 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "technical indicators as _ moving average _ and @xmath11 are part of the classical technical analysis and much used in efforts to predict market movements @xcite .",
    "one question is whether these techniques provide adequate ways to read the trends .",
    "consider a time series @xmath12 given at n discrete times @xmath13 . the series ( or signal ) moving average @xmath14 over a time interval @xmath15 is defined as    @xmath16    i.e. the average of @xmath17 over the last @xmath15 data points .",
    "one can easily show that if the signal @xmath12 increases ( decreases ) with time , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "thus , the moving average captures the trend of the signal given the period of time @xmath15 .",
    "the ibm daily closing value price signal between jan 01 , 1990 and dec 31 , 2000 is shown in fig .",
    "1 ( top figure ) together with yahoo moving average taken for @xmath20  days @xcite .",
    "the bottom figure shows the daily @xmath21 in millions .",
    "there can be as many trends as moving averages as @xmath15 intervals .",
    "the shorter the @xmath15 interval the more sensitive the moving average .",
    "however , a too short moving average may give false messages about the long time trend of the signal . in fig .",
    "2(a ) two moving averages of the ibm signal for @xmath15=5 days ( i.e. 1 week ) and 21  days ( i.e. 1 month ) are compared for illustration .",
    "= 5.1 cm = 5.4 cm = 5.2 cm = 5.2 cm    the intersections of the price signal with a moving average can define so - called lines of resistance or support @xcite .",
    "a line of resistance is observed when the local maximum of the price signal @xmath12 crosses a moving average @xmath14 .",
    "a support line is defined if the local minimum of @xmath12 crosses @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "2(a ) lines of resistance happen around may 1993 and lines of support around sept 1993 .",
    "support levels indicate the price where the majority of investors believe that prices will move higher , and resistance levels indicate the price at which a majority of investors feel prices will move lower .",
    "other features of the trends are the intersections between @xmath22 moving averages @xmath23 and @xmath24 which are usually due to drastic changes in the trend of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "consider two moving averages of ibm price signal for @xmath25  days and @xmath26  days ( fig .",
    "if @xmath12 increases for a long period of time before decreasing rapidly , @xmath23 will cross @xmath24 from above .",
    "this event is called a  death cross  in empirical finance @xcite . in contrast ,",
    "when @xmath23 crosses @xmath24 from below , the crossing point coincide with an upsurge of the signal @xmath12 .",
    "this event is called a  gold cross  .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to study the density of crossing points between two moving averages as a function of the size difference of the @xmath15 s defining the moving averages . based on this idea , a new and efficient approach has been suggested in ref.@xcite in order to estimate an exponent that characterizes the roughness of a signal .",
    "the so called @xmath11 is another instrument of the technical analysis and we will refer to it here as the _ classical momentum _ , in contrast to the generalized momentum @xcite .",
    "the classical momentum of a stock is defined over a time interval @xmath15 as    @xmath27    the momentum @xmath28 for three time intervals , @xmath29 and 250  days , i.e. one week , one month and one year , are shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) for ibm .",
    "the longer the period the smoother the momentum signal .",
    "much information on the price trend turns is usually considered to be found in a _ moving average of the momentum _    @xmath30    moving averages of the classical momentum over 1 week , 1 month and 1 year for the ibm price difference _ over the same time intervals _",
    ", @xmath31 are shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) . in fig .",
    "2(d ) the ibm signal and its weekly ( short - term ) , monthly ( medium - term ) and yearly ( long - term ) moving averages are compared to the weekly ( short - term ) , monthly ( medium - term ) and yearly ( long - term ) momentum indicators in order to better observe the bullish and bearish trends in 1999 .",
    "the message that is coming out of reading the combination of the these six indicators states that one could start buying at the momentum bottom , as it is for both monthly and weekly momentum indicators around mid february 1999 and buy the rest of the position when the price confirms the momentum uptrend and rises above the monthly moving average which is around march 1999 .",
    "the first selling signal is given during the second half of july 1999 by the death cross between short and medium term moving averages and by the maximum of the monthly momentum , which indicates the start of a selling . at the beginning of october 1999 , occurs the maximum of the long - term momentum .",
    "it is recommended that one can sell the rest of the position since the price is falling down below the moving average .",
    "hence , it is said that _ momentum indicators lead the price trend_. they give signals before the price trend turns over .    along the lines of the above for ibm , we analyze three latin america financial indices , argentinian merval , brazilian bovespa and mexican ipc ( indice de precios y cotizaciones ) applying the moving averages and the classical momentum concepts .",
    "3 the time evolution of the merval stock over the time interval mid 1996 - mid 2001 , is plotted with a simple moving average for @xmath3250  days showing the medium range trend of the price . the moving average and classical momentum of the merval stock prices for time horizons equal to one week , one month and one year are shown fig .",
    "the cases of the brazilian bovespa and mexican ipc ( indice de precios y cotizaciones ) are shown in figs .",
    "4 and 5 respectively .",
    "in 1969 the international monetary fund ( imf ) created the special drawing rights ( ticker symbol @xmath7 ; sometimes @xmath33 is also used ) , an artificial currency unit defined a basket of national currencies .",
