    "+ unlike in the continuum , where the zeta function has more information hidden behind the line of convergence - the key being analytic continuation - which allows for example to define notions like ray - singer determinant as @xmath80 , this seems not that interesting at first in the graph case because the pseudo determinant @xcite is already explicitly given as the product of the nonzero eigenvalues .",
    "why then study the zeta functions at all ?",
    "one reason is that for some graph limits like graphs approximating riemannian manifolds , an interesting convergence seems to take place and that in the circle case , to the right of the critical strip , a limit of @xmath47 leads to the classical riemann zeta function @xmath53 which is the dirac zeta function of the circle .",

    "it is possible that the fine structure of the limiting set of roots of circular zeta functions encodes information of the riemann zeta function itself and allow to see behind the abscissa of convergence of @xmath50 but there is no doubt that such an analysis would be much more difficult .",
