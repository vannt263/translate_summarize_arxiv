    "the alma interferometer measures visibilities , fourier components of the sky intensity distribution across a two - dimensional range of spatial frequencies , rather than directly imaging the emission . to properly compare these data with a source model",

    "past techniques for modeling interferometric lens observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have generally operated on reconstructed images that are subject to difficult - to - model biases and noise properties .",
    "furthermore , residual errors in calibration in the visibility data , such as those arising from imperfect knowledge of the antenna positions or uncompensated atmospheric delay , are often corrected as part of the imaging process through an iterative clean / self - calibration technique @xcite . however , the inclusion of the cleaning step in the determination of these corrections , which are then applied to the visibility data themselves , changes the data in ways that are not easily included in the modeling uncertainties . here",
    "we describe a visibility - based lens modeling technique that simultaneously determines these self - calibration phases so that we incorporate the full range of uncertainty present in the measurements .",
    "we model the lenses by generating model lensed images that are subjected to simulated observations and compared to the data .",
    "the source is assumed to have a symmetric gaussian light profile with four free parameters : flux density f@xmath29 , radius r@xmath29 , and positional offsets from the lens center @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the lens is modelled as a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) with five free parameters : mass inside the einstein radius @xmath32 , ellipticity @xmath33 , orientation angle @xmath34 ( east of north ) , and position @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the sie profile has been shown to be a good approximation to galaxy - scale density profiles @xcite . since lensed image positions provide very precise measurements of the projected mass interior to the images we report this robustly measured quantity in table  [ table : sources ] , the total mass ( @xmath32 ) inside the einstein radius ( @xmath37 ) of the lensing galaxies .",
    "however , the total halo masses associated with these galaxies will be much higher .",
    "magnification , @xmath38 , is calculated as the ratio of the total lensed to unlensed flux .",
    "given a set of lens and source parameters we make a high - resolution image of the lensed source , which we pad with zeroes and fourier transform to generate model visibilities .",
    "for each alma visibility , we interpolate the fourier transformed image to the alma @xmath39 , @xmath40 coordinates .",
    "we also correct for the antenna primary beam attenuation by multiplying the sky model images by the primary beam pattern before sampling the fourier modes .",
    "we use a symmetric gaussian with fwhm of 18  for the primary beam , which leads to minimal attenuation for these well - centered sources .",
    "the agreement between data and model visibilities is determined by calculating the @xmath41 between them , which requires an estimate of the visibility noise . because we observe strong sources , the visibility scatter has a contribution from the sky signal and",
    "can not be used to determine the noise level .",
    "instead , we derive noise levels by measuring visibility scatter after differencing visibilities that are adjacent in time for the same baseline / polarization / if , which has the effect of removing all sky signal .",
    "this gives results that are identical to those found by scaling the visibility noise to obtain a reduced @xmath41 of unity for the best - fit models .",
    "we explore the model parameter space using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method with metropolis - hastings sampling .",
    "an example of the parameter degeneracies in these fits is shown in figure  [ fig : triangle ] .",
    "an additional complication of the modeling procedure is the presence of uncorrected antenna - based phase errors in the data .",
    "observations of test sources , quasars with positions referenced to the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) , show significant residual phase errors after the primary phase calibration step . for simple source structures ,",
    "self - calibration using clean components as input for the phase correction is a standard procedure to improve image fidelity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in this application it would add significant complication to model the clean / self - cal process as part of the fitting , and leaving the phase errors uncorrected can significantly bias the model parameters because of the strong sensitivity to image flux ratios in the model .",
    "we have therefore developed a procedure to determine the self - cal phases as part of the model fitting .",
    "we optimize the @xmath41 for each step in the markov chain by adjusting the @xmath42 antenna phases .",
    "we find that the resulting phases vary little over the chain and closely resemble those found for nearby point sources added to the tracks to test the calibration and astrometry , giving us confidence in this method .",
    "additional details of the method and simulations of its effectiveness are provided in the appendix .",
    "the model parameter space is complex , with the possibility of multiple isolated minima separated by high barriers in @xmath41 . to decrease the possibility of missing important minima in the posterior we search the space more broadly by `` tempering '' , which is similar to the simulated annealing method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a control parameter , t ( the analog of temperature ) , is introduced to flatten the posterior surface and to make the minima more accessible .",
    "this is achieved by raising the posterior to the power 1/t ( with t@xmath431 ) .",
    "a primary goal of this work is to determine the lensing configuration for bright spt starburst galaxies and derive the total magnification . using a simple multi - component source model and a range of lensing geometries , @xcite showed that differential magnification of a dsfg can distort the sed in unpredictable ways by differentially lensing different source plane regions ( see also @xcite for a similar effect concerning molecular line ratios ) .",
    "a lens model is therefore essential if we wish to correctly interpret observations of these targets and place them in context with existing samples of unlensed starbursts . in principle , spatially resolved imaging of each molecular line is required to map that particular line to the source plane , however a single lens model based on continuum imaging , combined with physically motivated models for the relative filling factors of the emitting regions in other bands or molecular lines , can be used to place limits on the differential magnification between components .",
    "+     +     +     +    models for the four sources are shown in the rightmost panels of figure  [ fig : modeling ] .",
    "key parameters of the models are reported in table  [ table : sources ] .",
    "the lens models permit the calculation of some intrinsic properties of the lensed galaxies by simply dividing observed properties by the magnification .",
    "the four sources presented here were detected with 1.4  mm flux densities ranging from 30@xmath445  mjy . by correcting for the lensing magnification ( figure  [ fig : mu_dist ] )",
    "we find that the intrinsic 1.4 mm and 860   fluxes of these sources vary by a factor of several .",
    "the 860  fluxes span the range for sources identified in blank field surveys with scuba ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that even without the lensing boost the galaxies presented in this work would still be identified as luminous starbursts .",
    "the far - ir luminosities are even more widely varying , though always ultra luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) class , indicating star formation rates of several hundred to several thousand  yr@xmath2 .",
    "the intrinsic sizes of the source - plane emission regions ( @xmath44 in table  [ table : sources ] , the hwhm for the gaussian model components ) range from 0.5 to 2.4  kpc .",
    "this is at the lower range of the sizes generally inferred for starbursts from a variety of observables ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , including synchrotron emission @xcite low - j @xcite and even higher - j ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) co measurements .",
    "however , the selection of strongly lensed galaxies can result in a biased distribution of intrinsic source size , as noted by @xcite .",
    "some comments on the individual sources :    _ _ : this source has the lowest magnification of the set ( 5.4@xmath200.2 ) , and being the brightest of the four targets in apparent @xmath45 , it is by far the most luminous after correction for magnification .",
    "unlensed , with a flux density of 26  mjy it would be among the 860  -brightest high - redshift galaxies known . given the source size , the flux ( luminosity per area ) is @xmath46  kpc@xmath3 , implying a star - formation rate of 4200  yr@xmath2  kpc@xmath3 assuming a standard conversion for starbursting galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is remarkably high , 50@xmath5 higher than the average value found in marginally resolved starbursts by @xcite and a factor of several higher than observed for individual gmcs in the highly magnified source smm  j2135 - 0102 @xcite .",
    "the flux is comparable to the eddington limit @xcite , and the degeneracy between @xmath38 and r@xmath29 ( shown in figure  [ fig : triangle ] ) is such that larger magnification decreases r@xmath29 and further increases the flux .",
    "@xcite noted that such fluxes are relatively common among low - redshift ulirgs , which are generally more compact than high - redshift galaxies of similar luminosity , suggestive of a self - regulating process . because we find the luminosity of  to arise in a very compact region , its mode of star formation may be more similar to lower - redshift ulirgs than to most other high - redshift starbursts , despite being at @xmath47 .",
    "@xcite found a similar star formation density over a region of similar size in a @xmath48=6.4 quasar , so this is not unprecedented in the early universe .",
    "the optical spectrum of the lens does not show any lines or features that result in a robust redshift for the lens .",
    "however , the only lens modeling parameter that is degenerate with the redshifts is the lens mass .",
    "the mass of this lens is reported assuming @xmath49 for the lens .",

    "are very comparable to those observed in other samples of distant starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the posterior of the model parameters for  show two separate peaks in the lens and source positions , but the magnifications of both models are similar .",
    "the extended array data on this source can possibly break this degeneracy .    _",
    "_ : the large angular size of this ring suggests a massive lens , with the models indicating that the lens has a projected mass of nearly @xmath7  within a radius of 10  kpc .",
    "close alignment between the compact source ( labeled component `` a '' in table  [ table : sources ] ) , and caustic again leads to a large magnification .",
    "a single - component source does not provide an adequate fit , leaving a significant residual structure to the south east of the lens center ( figure  [ fig:0538oneblob ] ) . a far better match to the data",

    "we have used alma to image the submillimeter emission from four dsfgs discovered by the spt .",
    "we find that these objects resolve into ring - like structures expected from gravitational lensing , a picture confirmed by the redshift information we have for the submillimeter emission and nir counterparts .",
    "we present a visibility modeling procedure to fit gravitational lens models to these data and simultaneously correct the unknown phase errors of the antennas introduced by , e.g. , imperfect antenna positions . from this technique , we are able to correct for the magnification of the sources presented in this work and derive intrinsic properties , finding the galaxies to be typical high - redshift , dsfgs .",
    "the sensitivity of alma permits these lens models to be constrained in short observations .",
    "longer observations of lensed starbursts in future cycles will therefore enable studies of ism structure and lower luminosity molecular lines that are otherwise impossible to observe in unlensed systems .",
    "interferometric phase calibration procedures generally leave some residual phase errors due to imperfect baseline solutions , uncompensated atmospheric delays , or other effects .",
    "the magnitude of these errors depends on many factors , such as calibration interval and calibrator - source separation , and their importance depends on the signal to noise ratio in the data and the complexity of the imaging task . in the present application , small phase errors can redistribute flux between lensed images and without properly accounting for such effects in our lens modeling , the derived model parameter distributions may be significantly in error .",
    "a standard procedure to correct antenna - based phase errors is self - calibration . using a source model derived from images of the corrupted visibilities ,",
    "phase corrections are derived , the source is re - imaged , and another iteration can be made using a new source model produced from the phase - corrected visibilities .",
    "for the present purposes , the most significant disadvantage of this phase correction scheme is that the uncertainties associated with the source model against which the data are self - calibrated are not included in the lens modeling , and any structural errors introduced by noise or phase errors may become a permanent part of the lens model . here",
    "we propose a method to incorporate the phase correction into the lens modeling procedure , using the lensed structure as the source model for self calibration .    to implement this self calibration technique",
    ", we use a perturbative approach in which we assume that the current data is equal to the model plus an antenna based phase corruption .",
