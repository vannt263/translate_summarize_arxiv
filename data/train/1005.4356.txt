    "episodic high mass loss events dominate the final stages of massive star evolution . the evidence for these events is observed across the upper hr diagram ranging from giant eruptions like @xmath0 car , and the `` lbv nebulae '' associated with many of the luminous blue variables to the cool hypergiants and red supergiants like irc  + 10420 and vy cma with their complex circumstellar ejecta .",
    "unfortunately , the observational record is sparse because these stars are rare and their importance has only been fully recognized in recent years .",
    "modern supernova surveys are finding a growing assortment of similar and related objects .",
    "these `` impostors '' are under - luminous , have spectra with narrow emission lines and much slower ejection velocities .",
    "some of these objects may be undergoing ` giant ' eruptions possibly similar to @xmath0 car but with much shorter durations ( e.g. , sn 2009ip , @xcite ) .",
    "others appear to be generically related to the normal lbv / s dor variables like sn 2002 kg ( var 37 in ngc 2403 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a third subgroup including sn 2008s and the ngc 300 optical transient were heavily obscured prior to the outburst @xcite ; their progenitors may have recently evolved from a high mass losing stage such as an agb star or red supergiant @xcite .",
    "we used to think that `` eruptions '' in which the star increased its total luminosity were primarily associated with the most massive stars , upwards of 40 50 m@xmath1 , but the latter pair apparently originated from 10  20 m@xmath1 stars ( references above and @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus increasingly apparent that these eruptions or outbursts may not all be the same phenomenon ; the objects represent a range of stellar masses and may originate from stars in different evolutionary states .",
    "although discovery of these transient non - terminal eruptions are becoming more common , our information about them is still very incomplete .",
    "the most recent addition , sn2010u in ngc 4214 , was first reported in eruption on 5 february , 2010 ( s. nakano , cbet 2161 ) at apparent magnitude @xmath2 16 on unfiltered ccd frames . an early spectrum ( marion , vinko , & wheeler , cbet 2163 ) with strong , narrow emission lines of hydrogen , ca ii and na i with p cyg absorptions",
    ", quickly showed that it was not a true supernova , but possibly an eruptive variable or transient .    in this _",
    "we present pre and post - eruption observations of sn 2010u and a analysis of the associated stellar population in ngc 4214 .",
    "our discussion of its light curve , spectrum , and limitations on the mass and luminosity of its likely progenitor suggest that sn2010u is a very luminous nova , not the eruption of a massive star .",
    "the discovery photometry for sn 2010u reported in cbet 2161 listed magnitudes of 16.0 ( feb 5.6 ) , 16.3 ( feb 5.7 ) , 15.9 ( feb 6.5 ) amd 16.3 ( feb 6.6 ) on unfiltered ccd frames from different observers .",
    "however a fainter r magnitude of 17.3 was reported by brimacombe also on feb .",
    "this difference of more than a magnitude in such a short time seemed too large to be realistic . at our request ,",
    "the observers kindly provided their unfiltered ccd images .",
    "we determined the magnitude of sn 2010u relative to three sdss stars in the field with gri photometry converted to broadband r magnitudes .",
    "the photometry was done on galaxy - subtracted images , using a sdss r - band image for the template galaxy @xcite .",
    "the results yield an r band magnitude near 17  mag @xmath3 0.2  0.3  mag .",
    "we also obtained post - eruption photometry of sn 2010u with retrocam on the mdm hiltner 2.4 m telescope on kitt peak and the large binocular camera @xcite on the lbt on mt .",
    "the journal of observations and measured magnitudes for sn 2010u are included in table 1 and the resulting light curve is shown in figure 1 .",
    "adopting an approximate `` r - band '' magnitude of 17.1 for maximum light yields a red absolute magnitude of @xmath4 @xmath5 at a distance of @xmath4 3.2 mpc for ngc 4214 with a@xmath6 mag foreground galactic reddening from the _ nasa / ipac extragalactic database_. sn 2010u was clearly sub - luminous for a supernova .",
    "its maximum luminosity was more like the classical lbvs in their high mass loss or optically thick wind stage @xcite .",
    "however sn 2010u s very rapid decline is not typical of lbvs .",
    "we located the position of the transient on a deep , archival pre - outburst _ hst / wfc3 _ f814w image of ngc 4214 ( proposal 11360 ; pi r. oconnell ) obtained on 2009 , dec .",
    "23 , and shown in figure 2 . to solve the relative astrometry between the post - outburst lbt r - band image obtained on 2010 , mar .",
    "18 , and the pre - outburst wfc3 image , we used 6 bright , isolated point sources around the position of the transient identified in the wfc3 image .",
    "the astrometric solution was obtained using a 2nd order polynomial transformation with standard tasks in iraf ( _ geotran _ and _ geomap _ ) .",
    "the final rms of the solution is 0013 and 0021 in the x and y axis of the wfc3 image , respectively . as can be seen in figure 2 ,",
    "there is no progenitor identified in the pre - outburst wfc3 image within the uncertainties of the relative astrometry .",
    "we obtained consistent results using shallower archival wfpc2 and lbt pre - outburst images .",
    "the associated stellar population is shown on the cmd in figure 3 .",
    "the _ hst / wfpc2 _ @xmath7 and @xmath8 archival observations obtained on 1997 december 9 were reduced using the same procedure and with the same quality cuts as applied to the angst sample ( details in @xcite ) .",
    "the observations were calibrated and flat - fielded using the standard _ hst _",
    "pipeline and the magnitudes were measured using hstphot @xcite .",
    "only the highest quality photometry is used for the cmd .",
    "the color - coding corresponds to the spatial distribution of the stars relative to the position of sn 2010u in the lower panel .",
    "we find no visible star at the position of sn 2010u down to the 50% completeness limiting magnitudes of 24.4 and 23.5 of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 images , respectively , and thus no candidate precursor . at the distance of ngc 4214 ,",
    "these magnitude limits imply an upper limit of @xmath2 @xmath9 mag to the absolute visual magnitude of a possible progenitor .",
    "most of the stars within @xmath4 100 pc of sn2010u are relatively faint and red , with @xmath10 colors of @xmath2 1  2 mag , suggesting that the likely precursor is associated with an evolved population .",
    "of course , it is possible that the progenitor star may have been heavily obscured by circumstellar dust prior to its eruption similar to the ngc 300 ot @xcite and sn 2008s @xcite , and therefore be an intrinsically more luminous star .",
    "however , the spatial distribution ( figure 3 ) of the younger and more luminous main sequence stars , shows that the precursor star is not closely associated with a more massive young population .",
    "this , however , does not rule out an obscured , evolved star ( agb ) of lower mass .",
    "based on the cmd s , the characteristics of the associated stellar population , and the limiting magnitudes of the images , we suggest that the progenitor ( or its companion ) was most likely an evolved intermediate mass star , with an upper mass limit of 3 to 5 m@xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the post - maximum spectrum obtained on 20 february , 2010 , fourteen days after discovery .",
    "the ccds spectrograph on the hiltner 2.4 m mdm telescope was used with the 150_l _ grating giving a resolution of @xmath2 14 with a 2 slit .",
    "the low resolution spectrum is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by strong emission lines of h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 plus the o i blend at @xmath137774 .",
    "this is not the spectrum of an lbv at maximum nor does it resemble the spectra of the less luminous transients like sn 2008s and the ngc 300 - ot .",
    "the strong o i emission indicates it is most like a post - maximum nova .",
    "the lines are resolved with a fwhm of @xmath2 1900 km s@xmath14 , and the radial velocities of their line centers are 200  300 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 line profiles are asymmetric to the red , and h@xmath11 has asymmetric wings extending to @xmath152300 km s@xmath14 and + 3200 km s@xmath14 .",
    "the asymmetry in the line profiles and the wings may be due to remnant p cyg absorption .",
    "h@xmath11 and o",
    "i @xmath137774 also have split profiles possibly indicative of a bi - polar outflow or planar disk @xcite .",
    "similar profiles are often observed in classical novae @xcite .",
    "the blue and red emission peaks in the o i line are shifted by @xmath15610 and + 460 km s@xmath14 , respectively , relative to the line center .",
    "the corresponding shifts in h@xmath11 are less , @xmath16 km s@xmath14 and + 150 km s@xmath14 .",
    "other weaker lines in the spectrum are identified with fe ii , [ fe ii ] and [ o i ] .",
    "the nebular [ o iii ] lines may also be present , but they are blended with other lines .",
    "the rapid decline of the light curve , the post - maximum spectrum , and the relatively low mass and luminosity inferred from the lack of a precursor on deep pre - eruption images and the associated stellar population , all suggest that sn 2010u was a luminous nova .",
    "sn 2010u shares characteristics with the fast novae .",
    "if we adopt the observations by the amateur observers and assume that it was at or near maximum , then the time to decline by two magnitudes ( t@xmath17 ) is 15 days and the time to decline three magnitudes ( t@xmath18 ) is 26 days .",
    "these decline rates are consistent with a fast nova .",
    "classical novae obey the maximum - magnitude - rate of decline relation ( mmrd ) of @xcite .",
    "adopting m@xmath19 , of @xmath5 for maximum light and a @xmath20 color of 1.1 to 1.5 mag from v1500 cyg , a classical nova a few days past maximum light @xcite , m@xmath21 is @xmath4 @xmath22 to @xmath23  mag , near the upper luminosities observed for cne .",
    "a t@xmath17 of 15 days implies a maximum m@xmath21 of @xmath24 mag @xcite , comparable to sn 2010u s maximum luminosity .",
    "of course , it is possible that maximum was missed and sn 2010u was more luminous , but the p cyg profiles reported in cbet 2163 indicate that it was not missed by more than a few days .",
    "furthermore , a typical fast to moderately fast nova , with t@xmath17 @xmath2 15 days , has emission lines with fwhm from 2000 km s@xmath14 up to as high as 6000 km s@xmath14 .",
    "sn 2010u is on the low end but consistent with this range . @xcite",
    "have recently described a group of fast and luminous novae that are apparently inconsistent with the mmrd relation . however , sn 2010u is at the upper end of luminosities expected from the mmrd relation for normal novae and was super - eddington at maximum .",
    "while not a high mass eruptive variable like most of the other `` sn impostors '' , sn 2010u was indeed an impostor and is an excellent example of the need for post  maximum photometry and spectra , and a study of the stellar environment to determine the nature and evolutionary state of these objects .",
