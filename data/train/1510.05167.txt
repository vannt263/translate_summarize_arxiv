    "pathogens , e.g. viruses , fungi and bacteria , significantly affect the dynamics of invertebrates .",
    "experimental evidence reveals that some naturally harmless honey bee viruses turn instead epidemic via new transmission routes @xcite .",
    "specifically , when the parasitic mite _",
    "varroa jacobsoni _ , that normally affects the eastern honey bee _ apis cerana _ , switched host and started to attack the western honey bee _ apis mellifera _ , causing larger outbreaks of mites , in particular of _ varroa destructor _ , in _",
    "a. mellifera _ than in _",
    "a. cerana_. these mite populations act as bee viruses vectors , that are presumed to be the cause of the worldwide loss of mite - infested honey bee colonies , because they induce a much faster spread of the viruses than before .",
    "in order to better understand the _",
    "varroa_-infested colony response to these viruses , it is necessary to study the effects of mites and viral diseases together , since both pathogens appear simultaneously in fields conditions .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to formulate and investigate a mathematical model able to describe how the mite presence affects the epidemiology of these viruses on adult bees . to this end , we take into consideration all the possible transmission routes for honey bee viral diseases , including the vectorial one through parasitizing mites .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the biological background , briefly describing the host _ apis mellifera _",
    ", the vector _ varroa destructor _ , the honey bee viral diseases and the triangular relationship between them .    in section [ sec : model ] the model is formulated , assessing some basic properties , like well - posedness . section [ sec : equil ] investigates its equilibria for feasibility and the following section [ sec : stab ] for the stability analysis . in section [ sec : sim ] we provide a set of reasonable values for the parameters , those that can be obtained from field data , and perform numerical simulations interpreting their results .",
    "bifurcations are investigated in section [ sec : bif ] , connecting all the equilibria together and further showing that they completely capture the system s behavior , as persistent oscillations among the populations are proven to be impossible .",
    "sensitivity analysis is carried out in the following section [ sec : sens ] .",
    "a final discussion concludes the paper .",
    "in the summer season a honey bee colony harbors generally a single reproductive queen , living on average @xmath0 to @xmath1 years , with about @xmath2 adult female worker bees , @xmath3 to @xmath4 individuals at the brood stage ( egg , larvae and pupae ) and a few hundreds of male drones , @xcite .",
    "this large population of workers takes care of the colony by foraging , producing honey , caring for and rearing the brood and the bees new generation .",
    "the queen lays fertilized eggs producing worker bees and , rather seldom , other queens , and non - fertilized eggs from which drones are born . during the winter the queen and around @xmath5 to @xmath6 adult workers thrive feeding only on the honey produced and stored in the previous summer . because of the population density experienced in such an environment , the honey bees can very easily be affected by pathogens , @xcite .",
    "honey bees have many defences against diseases : for instance , grooming the mites away from their bodies , or removing the infested brood .",
    "however , colonies still suffer from a number of diseases and pests .",
    "a mature _ varroa _ mite is in one of its two life stages , the phoretic one , when it thrives attacking a bee and sucking its hemolymph . to this end",
    ", it pierces the cuticle of the bee with its specialized mouth - parts . as the mite can switch host during this phase",
    ", it may spread viruses in the colony by sucking them from one host and then injecting them into a healthy individual , @xcite .",
    "the honey bee mortality induced by the subtraction of hemolymph and the tearing of tissues in the act of sucking is very insignificant .",
    "therefore , the damage to bee colonies derives from the parasitic action of the mite but , above all , from its action as vector of many viral seriously harmful diseases .",
    "when grooming , the bees bite the mites and the latter may fall off to the bottom of the hive , constituting the `` natural mite drop '' , which however represents only a small part of the whole mite population .",
    "in fact , the mites second life stage is the reproductive one , in which they are hidden under the cell cappings , @xcite . to lay eggs , an adult female mite moves from an adult bee into the cell of a larva .",
    "when the brood cell is capped , the larva begins pupating and the mite starts to feed .",
    "about three days later the mite lays its eggs : one is unfertilized and produces a male , four to six are fertilized and give rise to females . after hatching , the females feed on the pupa and mate with the male .",
    "the surviving mature female mites remain attached to the host bee when the latter becomes adult and leaves the cell .",
    "most of honey bee viruses commonly cause covert infections , i.e. the virus can be detected at low titers within the honey bee population in the absence of obvious symptoms in infected individuals or colonies .",
    "however , when injected into the open circulatory system of the insects , in which the hearth pumps blood into the space in between the organs rather than in closed vessels as in vertebrates , these diseases are extremely virulent : just a few viral particles per bee are sufficient to cause the death within a few days .    the most serious problem caused by _",
    "varroa destructor _ is therefore the transmission of viral diseases to honey bees .",
    "scientists have found viruses in honey bees since decades , but in general they were considered harmless .",
    "only when about thirty years ago _ varroa _ became a widespread problem , about twenty different viruses have been associated with _",
    "mites , that are their physical or biological vectors , @xcite . indeed ,",
    "when a virus - carrying mite during its phoretic phase attaches to a healthy bee , it can transmit the virus to the bee , thereby infecting it .",
    "further , viral diseases are also transmitted among bees through food , feces , from queen to egg , and from drone to queen .    on the other hand ,",
    "a virus - free phoretic mite can become a physical virus carrier horizontally from other infected mites , but also when it attaches to an infected bee .",
    "therefore to control the viruses , the _ varroa _ population in a hive should be kept in check , while symptoms of viral diseases usually indicate the presence of _ varroa _ in the colony , @xcite .",
    "epidemiological surveys and laboratory experiments have demonstrated that especially two viruses can successfully be transmitted between honey bees during mite feeding activities : deformed wing virus ( dwv ) and acute paralysis virus ( abpv ) .",
    "we briefly describe them in the next subsections .",
    "this syndrome in infected bees is rather benign , causing covert infections with no visible symptoms , @xcite .",
    "but in the presence of _ varroa destructor _ , overt dwv infections are much more common .",
    "the affected bees show deformed wings , bloated and shortened abdomens , discoloration and are bound to die within three days from the infection",
    ". the outcome could even be the whole colony destruction .",
    "further , dwv appears to replicate in _ varroa _ , making it also a biological vector .",
    "abpv was present at low concentrations as a covert infection in adult bees , but never caused paralysis outbreaks .",
    "however , when _ varroa destructor _ established in the european honey bee populations , the virus has been found in the bees worldwide , and is now geographically distributed as the _ a. mellifera _ , @xcite .    affected bees by this virus",
    "are unable to fly , lose the hair from their bodies and tremble uncontrollably .",
    "the virus has been suggested to be a primary cause of bee mortality .",
    "infected pupae and adults suffer rapid death .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the healthy bees , @xmath8 the infected ones , @xmath9 the healthy mites , @xmath10 the infected ones .",
    "the model reads as follows : @xmath11 the first equation expresses the dynamics of healthy bees .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 represents the daily birth rate of the bees , which we assume that are born healthy in proportion of the fraction of healthy bees in the colony .",
    "this takes into account the fact that the disease is transmitted to larvae mainly by infected nurse bees that contamine royal jelly .",
    "furthermore , the second term models the situation in which , if attacked by infected mites , the healthy bees may contract the virus carried by the mite at transmission rate @xmath13",
    ".    horizontal transmission among the bees occurs at rate @xmath14 either via small wounds of the exoskeleton , e.g. as a result of hair loss , or ingestion of faeces .",
    "the fourth term in the equation describes the bees natural mortality , at rate @xmath15 , while the last ones model the competition due to parasitism .",
    "the second equation describes the evolution of infected bees . as for the healthy bees , they reproduce at rate @xmath12 , but in proportion now to the fraction of infected bees in the population .",
    "the second and third terms account for the new recruits is this class due to horizontal contacts , respectively with infected mites and bees .",
    "infected bees are subject to both their natural @xmath15 and disease - related @xmath16 mortalities .",
    "the remaining terms describe again competition .",
    "the third and fourth equations model respectively the dynamics of healthy and infected mites .",
    "the growth of sound mites is described by the @xmath17 function . when attacking the infected bees they can , in turn , contract the virus with transmission rate @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , healthy mites can acquire the virus also horizontally from other infected mites at rate @xmath19 .",
    "note that viral infection is not transmitted to their offsprings ; we therefore exclude vertical transmission among mites . the last term in both equations models the grooming behavior of healthy bees at rate @xmath20 .",
    "we exclude this behavior for infected bees , as they are instead weakened by the virus to be able to perform any resistance against _ varroa _ mites .",
    "note that in formulating the fourth equation we account for the fact that the virus does not cause any harm to the infected _ varroa _ population , but individuals remain infected until their natural death , that occurs at rate @xmath21 , hence there can not be any disease recovery . on the other hand ,",
    "we consider the effect of intraspecific competition between healthy and infected mites at rate @xmath22 .",
    "the remaining terms once again describe the new recruits in this class , from horizontal contacts with infected bees or mites .    finally , we make the following simplifying assumptions :    * the daily bees birth rate @xmath12 is constant , * the honey bee mortality induced by the presence of _ varroa _ mite can be neglected when compared with their natural and disease - related mortality , so that we set @xmath23 ; * healthy mites grow in a logistic fashion with reproduction rate @xmath24 and carrying capacity @xmath25 , so that @xmath26    therefore , system ( [ model0 ] ) reduces to the following one , written in shorthand as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the population vector and the components of the right hand side @xmath29 are explicitly given by : @xmath30      in this section we show that the system is well - posed .",
    "basically , we follow the path of @xcite .    we need this because the right - hand side of is not well - defined at the points where @xmath31 .",
    "but the next result shows that the solutions are always bounded away from this set .",
    "let us first define the subset @xmath32 of @xmath33 of the points that are away from the singularity , namely @xmath34    [ teobound ] if @xmath35 , then there exists a unique solution of defined on @xmath36 such that @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "further , @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "the right - hand side of the system is globally lipschitz continuous on @xmath32 , so that existence and uniqueness of the solution of system is ensured for every trajectory that is at a finite distance of this boundary .",
    "we now show that ( [ bound1 ] ) and ( [ bound2 ] ) hold for all the trajectories originating from a point where @xmath44 . from the boundedness of the variables",
    ", it will follow that all trajectories are defined on an infinite horizon and they stay away from the set @xmath45 .",
    "summing the first two equations in , for any point inside @xmath32 we obtain @xmath46 integrating this differential inequality between any two points @xmath37 and @xmath47 of a trajectory for which @xmath48 , @xmath49 $ ] , we get @xmath50 where the right - hand side is positive for any @xmath38 .    similarly , we have @xmath51 and therefore @xmath52 from and , it is easy to see that the inequalities in hold for any portion of trajectory remaining inside @xmath32 .",
    "we now consider the evolution of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . defining the whole _",
    "mite population as @xmath53 and summing the last two equations in yield , for any point inside @xmath32 , @xmath54 the latter is a logistic term , thus the solution trajectory moves toward the stable equilibrium point @xmath55 .",
    "hence , we get @xmath56 for all @xmath57 , proving .    from the results on @xmath58 and",
    "@xmath59 the boundedness of all populations follows .",

    "since the domain of definition of is @xmath32 we exclude solutions not included in it .",
    "the admissible equilibria are then @xmath62 which are always feasible , @xmath63 which is feasible for @xmath64 then we find @xmath65 so that feasibility for @xmath66 is given by @xmath67    to find the equilibrium point with no healthy bees , we proceed as follows . from the second equation of ,",
    "we find @xmath68 substituting the value of @xmath8 and rearranging , the last two equations provide two conic sections : @xmath69 which explicitly is @xmath70 and @xmath71 , given by @xmath72 thus , the equilibrium follows from determining the intersection of these two conic sections in the fist quadrant of the @xmath73 phase plane .",

    "in particular , @xcite , we compute the logarithmic sensitivity solutions , namely @xmath187 for @xmath177 and @xmath178 .    calculating , we find that a positive perturbation of @xmath24 leads to a decrease of up to 170% in the healthy bee population at @xmath188 days , a 30% decrease in the infected bee population at @xmath189 days , a 300% increase in the healthy mite population at @xmath190 days , and a 250% increase in the infected mite population at @xmath190 days",
    ".    however , we also note that over 200% changes , at time @xmath191 days , in the mite populations are not significant due to their low level of concentration at time @xmath191 days in the solution .",
    "this is shown in figure for the set of parameter values used to perform sensitivity analysis .",
    "we now turn to the parameter @xmath16 , second in order of sensitivity . from fig .",
    ", it is clear that a higher value for the disease - related mortality of the bees has a positive impact on the healthy bee population and a negative influence on the infected bee population . in particular , at the end of the observation period we find an increase of @xmath192 units ( about 200% ) in the healthy bee population and a reduction of @xmath193 units ( less than 50% ) in the infected bee population .    .",
    "]    according to our results , an increase in @xmath16 inevitably leads to a decrease in the infected bee population .",
    "the shorter time of survival means that there is also less time for the virus to be transmitted .",
    "this gives an explanation for the positive impact on the healthy bee population .",
    "this is in line with our earlier observations : when transmitted by varroa mites , the most virulent diseases at the colony level are the least harmful ones to the single bees .",
    "lastly we find the negative influence of @xmath14 on the population of healthy bees with an expected decrease of @xmath193 units and a percentage change of about 100% at the end of the observation period , as shown in fig . .",
    "]    to conclude the analysis , we look at fig . . both a positive change in the _ varroa _ natural mortality rate , @xmath21 , as well as in their intraspecific competition coefficient , @xmath22 , have a positive effect on the healthy bee population and , unexpectedly , also on the infected bee population .",
    "this suggests that the horizontal transmission of the virus among honey bees would increase the infected bee population also for higher values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , i.e. for a lower level of _ varroa _ infestation .",
    "the influence of the parameter @xmath14 on the bee population also explains the frame on the bottom : even a positive perturbation in the honey bee birth rate will yield a decrease in the population of healthy bees , which soon leave this class to benefit the population of the infected ones .",
    "furthermore , the latter is really sensitive with respect to @xmath12 , with a dramatic increase of about @xmath185 units ( 100% ) as early as time @xmath194 .",
    "the parameter of interest is usually perturbed by doubling or halving it , in order to understand how sensitive the system dynamics are to such changes in it .",
    "therefore , for each parameter we perform the sensitivity analysis doubling and halving it to find out that the effect of these perturbations is always the same and sensitivity solution plots differ only by the scale on the temporal axis . in particular , doubling parameters yields to a shorter temporal scale , while a longer one is obtained by halving them .",
    "the knowledge of the most influential parameters allows us to understand on which one of them we could act in order to drive the system to a safer situation . from a theoretical point of view , we can conclude that the population of healthy bees would benefit from both a reduction in the _ varroa _ growth rate , as well as a reduction in the horizontal transmission rate among bees .",
    "field and research evidence indicate that the long - term decline of managed honey beehives in the western countries is associated with the presence of viruses in the honey bee populations , @xcite . while formerly the viruses produced only covert infections , their combination with the invading parasite _ varroa destructor _ has triggered the emergence of overt viral infections .",
    "these cause concern because they entail fatal symptoms at both the individual bee level and at the colony level , constituting a major global threat for apiculture .",
    "in model presented here we combine bee and mite population dynamics with viral epidemiology , to produce results that match field observations well and give a clear explanation of how _ varroa _ affects the epidemiology of certain naturally occurring bee viruses , causing considerable damages to colonies .    in the model",
    ", there are only four possible stable equilibria , using the known field parameters , see table [ table2 ] .",
    "the first one contains only the thriving healthy bees . here",
    "the disease is not present and also the mites are wiped out .",
    "alternatively , there is another equilibrium where the mite population still disappears , but the disease remains endemic among the bee population that survives .",
    "thirdly , infected bees coexist with the mites in the _ varroa _ invasion scenario ; in this situation the disease invades the hive , affecting all the bees and driving the healthy bees to extinction .",
    "the final coexistence equilibrium is also possible , with both populations of bees and mites thriving and with an endemic disease in the beehive among both species .",
    "transcritical bifurcations relate these points while , in spite of the four dimensionality of the system , which may render them more likely , hopf bifurcations have been shown not to arise .      on the one hand",
    ", the endemic disease can not affect all the bees in a _",
    "varroa_-free colony .",
    "according to the envisioned role of _ v. destructor _ as disease vector for increasing virulence of honey bee viruses , from the analysis the disappearance of whole healthy bee population in a _",
    "varroa_-infested colony seems much more likely than in a _",
    "varroa_-free colony .",
    "the findings of this study also indicate that a low horizontal virus transmission rate among honey bees in beehives will help in protecting the bee colonies from the _ varroa _ infestation and the viral epidemics .",
    "the model presented here gives good qualitative insight into the spread of the bee disease .",
    "however , in its assumptions certain effects that can be relevant are omitted .",
    "therefore , its primary value lies in the context of qualitative understanding rather than that of a quantitative prediction .",
    "for instance , the simulations use constant parameter values , but it remains to be investigated whether the qualitative results would change if continuously changing parameters instead were considered .    similarly , also the intraspecific competition coefficient among _ varroa _ @xmath22 , taken here as constant , could reasonably be considered as a bee - population - dependent function , since mites essentially compete for the host hemolymph .    nevertheless , despite this simplicity the model presented here might be a good starting point for the development of other more sophisticated models including seasonality and other aspects relevant for the bee colony health , or for example to investigate the effectiveness of various _ varroa _ treatment strategies .                c. costa , e. carpana , m. lodesani , a. nanetti , patologie e avversit delle api : tecniche diagnostiche e di campionamento ( pathologies and adversity of bees : diagnostical and sampling techniques ) , unit di ricerca di apicoltura e bachicoltura ( cra - api )",
