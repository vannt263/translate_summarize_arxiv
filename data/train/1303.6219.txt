    "extended poincar supergravity theories and their ultraviolet behavior have been a subject of renewed interest in recent years .",
    "although , in general , supersymmetry softens ultraviolet divergences , it can not overcome the effects of the two - derivative stress tensor coupling characteristic to gravitational theories .",
    "it has been suggested that , apart from supersymmetry , non - compact global symmetries @xcite of the equations of motion of @xmath10 classical supergravity theories also play an important role in constraining the ultraviolet behavior of theories exhibiting them .",
    "these duality symmetries , involving electric / magnetic duality transformations of abelian vector fields , are specific to four - dimensional extended supergravity theories ; their origin is related to dimensional reduction from higher - dimensional supergravities .",
    "the largest duality group is that of @xmath11 supergravity , @xmath12 .",
    "other supergravities can be obtained as consistent truncations from @xmath11 supergravity and their duality groups may be thought of as subgroups of @xmath12 . while the duality groups of @xmath3 supergravities are expected to be preserved at the quantum level due to the absence of anomalies , an abelian subgroup of the classical @xmath1 duality group of @xmath13 supergravity",
    "was argued in @xcite to be anomalous .",
    "quite generally , one may say that an anomaly is present whenever a classical ( global or local ) symmetry is broken by quantum corrections .",
    "it may either be a symmetry of the lagrangian or of the equations of motion or a symmetry of scattering amplitudes ( i.e. a symmetry realized on asymptotic states )",
    ". it would undoubtedly be interesting to identify the consequences of an anomaly such as that of @xmath14 at the level of the scattering matrix of the theory and to address an open question of whether its presence has any consequences for the ultraviolet properties of higher - order s - matrix elements ( for a recent discussion see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". anticipating our results , we will find a close relation between the @xmath2 anomaly and special classes of amplitudes of @xmath13 supergravity which vanish at tree - level but not at one - loop ; though the double - copy construction of supergravity amplitudes they are related to non - supersymmetric gauge theory amplitudes that have similar properties .",
    "as it is well - known , @xmath13 supergravity can be formulated in different classically - equivalent ways . in the `` covariant '' formulation , the global symmetry @xmath1 acts linearly on two complex scalar fields @xmath15 ( satisfying @xmath16 ) while an auxiliary local @xmath2 symmetry ( with field - dependent composite gauge field ) acts also on other fields .",
    "the physical complex scalar field of the @xmath13 supergravity multiplet parameterizes the coset @xmath17 .",
    "an alternative `` unitary - gauge '' formulation corresponds to a particular gauge choice for the auxiliary @xmath2 gauge symmetry .",
    "the action of the global @xmath2 symmetry on vector fields has the interpretation of an electric / magnetic duality rotation .",
    "the @xmath2 anomaly has different  but related  interpretations in these two formulations @xcite : in the former it is the chiral anomaly of the auxiliary @xmath2 gauge symmetry , while in the latter it is the chiral anomaly of a particular global @xmath2 duality subgroup whose precise embedding into @xmath1 depends on the gauge choice for the auxiliary gauge symmetry .",
    "the crucial point in the computation of the duality symmetry anomaly in the `` unitary - gauge '' formulation in  @xcite was the inclusion of the vector field contribution to the anomaly . as the vectors transform under the duality in a nonlocal way , via a @xmath18 rotation of their on - shell field strength , this",
    "was done indirectly , via a topological count of anomaly for self - dual tensors .",
    "the corresponding anomaly may indeed be interpreted as the vector field contribution to the chiral gravitational anomaly , i.e. as the non - vanishing of the expectation value of the divergence of the corresponding current in a non - trivial gravitational background as was understood in unrelated work in @xcite .",
    "this anomaly was also rederived using a lorentz non - covariant doubled - vector formulation in @xcite .    here",
    "we shall present a novel way of understanding this anomaly , by relating it to a similar anomaly @xcite in the conformal supergravity ( csg ) @xcite , which admits a formulation where @xmath1 is a global off - shell symmetry .",
    "the key observation is that the classical @xmath0 poincar supergravity  ( psg ) has a superconformal formulation @xcite as the @xmath13 conformal supergravity coupled to six @xmath13 vector multiplets ( with the higher - derivative action of pure @xmath13 csg not added ) . in this superconformal framework the six vector fields , which ( upon gauge - fixing of the conformal symmetry and s - supersymmetry and elimination of the auxiliary fields ) become the six vector fields of the psg multiplet , couple via their field strengths @xmath19 to the six ( anti)self - dual rank-2 tensors @xmath20 appearing in the csg multiplet and that provides a possible link between the @xmath19 and @xmath21 contributions to the corresponding anomalies .    for @xmath11 poincar supergravity",
    ", it was argued in @xcite that , at the tree - level , the @xmath12 duality symmetry group implies that all scattering amplitudes vanish in the single soft scalar limit ( i.e. the limit in which the momentum of a scalar field goes to zero ) .",
    "this may be viewed as a consequence of the on - shell @xmath22 r - symmetry group of the theory .",
    "it has also been argued in @xcite and further detailed in @xcite that the double soft scalar limit ( i.e. the limit in which the momenta of two scalar fields vanish simultaneously ) probes the commutation relations of the duality group . to this end",
    "it is necessary that the soft scalars share three of their four @xmath22 indices  @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis has not yet been carried out for @xmath13 poincar supergravity . as was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath13 supergravity can be interpreted as an orbifold truncation of @xmath11 supergravity . from this perspective , the one physical complex scalar field of the former theory is a linear combination of the scalar fields of the latter . as such , the tree - level scattering amplitudes of the @xmath13 supergravity are a subset of those of the @xmath11 supergravity and thus they should vanish in the soft scalar limit",
    ". however , it appears difficult to probe the commutation relations of the @xmath13 duality group @xmath1 as only one scalar field survives the orbifold projection which , in the @xmath11 context , is insufficient  @xcite for probing any of the commutation relations of @xmath12 .",
    "the next step would be to study directly the soft scalar limits of the _ one - loop _ amplitudes in @xmath13 supergravity . as we shall see below , the @xmath14 symmetry that requires",
    "the vanishing of the tree - level soft scalar limits is _ broken _ at one - loop level and there exist amplitudes with nontrivial @xmath2 charge which are non - vanishing ; we shall refer to them as  anomalous amplitudes \" .",
    "the mechanism through which these amplitudes are non - vanishing is quite similar to the one leading to the chiral anomaly  a divergence in a loop integral",
    "is compensated by a zero in its coefficient ( in the amplitude case from the momenta of states running in the loop ) .",
    "we will construct examples of such amplitudes and find their soft scalar limit .",
    "we will then use the resulting soft scalar functions to construct the one - loop all - multiplicity @xmath2-violating mhv amplitudes with all external legs belonging to a single on - shell chiral multiplet .",
    "we shall also consider the scattering amplitudes in @xmath13 poincar supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number @xmath23 of abelian @xmath13 matter ( vector ) multiplets . while in the presence of matter multiplets @xmath13 poincar supergravity has ultraviolet divergences already at one - loop supergravity level (",
    "the relevant counterterm is proportional to the square of the matter - field stress tensor @xcite ) we may restrict consideration to a finite sector with all external states belonging to the supergravity multiplet and track down the contribution of the matter multiplets to the @xmath2 anomalous amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath2 charges of matter fields are related to those of the fields of the supergravity multiplet by the @xmath24 symmetry of matter - coupled @xmath13 supergravity .",
    "the construction of one - loop amplitudes in @xmath13 supergravity with and without matter multiplets is made straightforward by the use of the duality between color and kinematics of super yang - mills theory amplitudes , uncovered in @xcite , and the corresponding double - copy construction of ( super)amplitudes in related supergravity theories @xcite . according to the color / kinematics duality conjecture",
    ", the integrands of super yang - mills theory amplitudes can be organized in terms of graphs with only cubic vertices such that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the jacobi identities obeyed by the graphs color factors and their kinematic numerator factors .",
    "whenever such a representation is available , the ( super)amplitudes of a related supergravity theory are obtained by simply replacing the color factors with the kinematic numerator factors of a second - factor gauge theory .",
    "the validity of the construction can be easily confirmed through the evaluation of the @xmath25-dimensional unitarity cuts .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we will discuss the @xmath2 anomaly of the poincar supergravity from the perspective of the superconformal formulation of the theory .",
    "we will then construct in detail the anomaly - induced terms in the one - loop effective action in the `` unitary - gauge '' formulation of the theory with manifest @xmath26 r - symmetry .",
    "we shall assume a general reparametrization - invariant regularization scheme and will comment on the structure of other ( parity - even , non - anomalous , finite ) terms that should also appear in the effective action to maintain supersymmetry .",
    "we shall discuss a consistent assignment of the @xmath2 charges to extra matter multiplets coupled to @xmath13 poincar supergravity and identify a certain @xmath2 symmetry of asymptotic states such that their corresponding charges are the same as their charges with respect to @xmath14 . in section  3 ,",
    "after a general discussion on the structure and double - copy @xcite construction of the scattering amplitudes in matter - coupled @xmath13 supergravity , we will proceed to compute explicitly , through the double - copy construction and the generalized unitarity method , the three- , four- and five - point amplitudes that break the asymptotic - state @xmath2 symmetry previously identified and which are forbidden in the @xmath27 supergravities .",
    "these amplitudes are uv finite and have rational dependence on external momenta . as usual in scattering",
    "superamplitude calculations , the result preserves manifestly the supersymmetry of the asymptotic states .",
    "we also discuss in some detail the same amplitudes in matter - coupled @xmath13 supergravity .",
    "in section  4 we will analyse the soft scalar limits of these amplitudes and use them to present a well - motivated conjecture for the all - multiplicity one - loop superamplitudes with all fields in one of the two @xmath13 on snell supergravity multiplets .",
    "these amplitudes correspond to a particular term in the one - loop effective action containing two gravitons and having holomorphic scalar - field dependence .",
    "we compare it with the general form of the anomaly - induced effective action found in section 2 .",
    "we close in section  5 with remarks on nontrivial contributions of the one - loop anomalous amplitudes to higher - loop amplitudes as well as on the existence of an analogous @xmath2 ( electric / magnetic ) duality symmetry in matter - coupled supergravity theories with fewer supercharges which , for certain ( non - zero ) numbers of matter multiplets , can be obtained by truncation from @xmath11 supergravity .",
    "this symmetry appears to be broken ( via a mechanism similar to the one described above ) by finite graviton - matter amplitudes .    in appendix",
    "a we shall comment on the vector field contribution to the chiral anomaly on a gravitational background . in appendix",
    "b we shall discuss the local parity - even scalar - curvature - curvature term which is a natural superpartner of the local part of the parity - odd anomalous term in the effective action .",
    "appendices c , d and e contain details on the construction and evaluation of @xmath28 -point anomalous amplitudes .",
    "our aim here will be to study the structure of the @xmath2 anomaly in poincar supergravity ( psg ) @xcite ( with or without additional @xmath29 matter multiplets ) and its consequences for the corresponding scattering amplitudes .",
    "by @xmath2 anomaly here we mean the anomaly of an auxiliary gauge symmetry in covariant formulation in which a global @xmath1 duality symmetry is realized linearly or , equivalently , the anomaly of a particular global @xmath14 symmetry in a `` physical gauge '' , where the local @xmath2 symmetry is gauge - fixed .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , pure psg theory @xcite may be interpreted as a spontaneously broken ( and gauge - fixed ) version of conformal supergravity ( csg ) @xcite coupled to six vector multiplets ( assuming the higher - derivative `` kinetic '' term of the csg theory is not included ) .",
    "a similar formulation also holds for @xmath13 psg coupled to psg to @xmath30 matter vector multiplets : one is to start with @xmath31 vector multiplets ( with six vector multiplets having `` wrong '' sign of kinetic term ) coupled to conformal supergravity .",
    "given that ( i ) the anomalies of spontaneously broken and unbroken phases of csg may be expected to be the same ( as suggested by the classical equivalence of the two phases ) , and also that ( ii ) anomalies are usually controlled by lowest derivative terms ( i.e. are they are unchanged by addition of higher - derivative terms with same symmetry ) , one may conjecture that the @xmath2 anomaly of psg @xcite can be understood in terms of the corresponding anomaly @xcite of the system of higher - derivative csg coupled to @xmath13 vector multiplets .",
    "we shall demonstrate that this is so in sections [ sec31 ] and [ sec32 ] below .",
    "then , we shall discuss the detailed structure of the corresponding anomalous effective action of psg in section  [ sec33 ] .",
    "let us begin by recalling the field content of csg @xcite .",
    "in a `` unitary gauge '' formulation the scalar sector is described by a complex scalar @xmath33 parametrizing the coset @xmath17 .",
    "the fields with non - zero chiral @xmath2 weights @xmath34 are then :    lll    1 complex scalar @xmath33 ( -2 ) & 4 left spinors @xmath35 & 10 complex scalars @xmath36 ( -1 )    6 ( anti)self - dual tensors @xmath37 ( -1 ) & 20 spinors @xmath38}\\ ( - \\ha)$ ] & 4 left - handed gravitini @xmath39    in the `` covariant '' formulation with manifest ( linearly - acting ) @xmath1 symmetry @xcite the scalar @xmath33 is replaced by a doublet of complex scalars @xmath15 with ^ ^*___1^ * _1-^*_2 _2 = ^_=1 ,  = 1,2  , by adding an extra @xmath2 gauge symmetry .",
    "then @xmath40 transforms under the global @xmath1 ( with matrix @xmath41 ) as well as under the local @xmath2 ( with parameter @xmath42 ) as follows : @xmath43 .",
    "the field @xmath40 is assigned the @xmath2 chiral weight @xmath44 while other fields have the same weights as above .",
    "this assignment is consistent with supersymmetry transformations at full non - linear level as given in @xcite ( with the parameter @xmath45 of poincar supersymmetry having weight 1/2 ) .",
    "only the scalar doublet @xmath40 transforms under @xmath1 , but all other fields transform under the local @xmath2 ( with the corresponding weights ) .",
    "that means that all the fields with derivative couplings and non - zero chiral weights couple to the composite @xmath2 gauge field @xmath46 through covariant derivatives ( we ignore the fermionic term @xmath47 in @xmath48 ) d_= _ + i a _  ,   a_= i 2 ( ^__- _ _ ^ ) = i ^ _ _  .",
    "the composite real field @xmath48 transforms under @xmath2 ( by a gradient ) and is invariant under @xmath1 .",
    "for example , in the particular @xmath2 gauge _1 = _1^ *  , one may parametrize @xmath15 in terms of the above complex scalar @xmath49 , i.e. _ 1 = ( 1- |c|^2)^-1/2  ,   _ 2 = c(1- |c|^2)^-1/2  . an @xmath1 transformation requires a compensating local @xmath2 transformation to preserve the gauge ( [ gre ] ) .",
    "i 2 ( 1 -    @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "this @xmath46 is no longer a singlet of redefined @xmath1 ; indeed , under @xmath1 acting ( non - linearly ) on @xmath33 the field @xmath48 is shifted by the gradient of field - dependent function multiplied by a rigid @xmath1 parameter , i.e. by an induced @xmath2 transformation with field - dependent parameter .",
    "an anomaly in the latter @xmath2 symmetry implies that the finite part of the effective action breaks the rigid @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the anomalies on csg were discussed in @xcite using this `` unitary gauge '' formulation .",
    "the anomaly of the rigid @xmath2 corresponding to the above @xmath2 weights comes from the ( chiral ) spinors and the self - dual tensors only .",
    "they are coupled to @xmath48 and the gravitational connection but since @xmath52 here is zero , only the gravitational anomaly is present .",
    "we can normalize it to the anomaly of a single left - handed fermion having the chiral weight @xmath53 a_1/2 = _ j^= - k 24 ( 4 ) ^2 r r^ *  ,   k = c=1  .",
    "where @xmath54 is the dual curvature tensor . for a massless spin ( helicity ) @xmath55 field with _ standard _ kinetic term and chiral weight @xmath56 ,",
    "the anomaly of the corresponding axial current obeys ( [ 2 ] ) with ( @xmath57 is related @xcite to the difference of the number of left- and right- handed zero modes of the corresponding laplace operators , with ghost contributions properly accounted for ) k = c_s _ s  ,    _ s= ( -1)^2s 4 ( 2 s^3-s )  , so that the spinor : vector : graviton anomalies are related as 1:4:(-21 ) . in general , for a collection of fields with chiral weights @xmath56 and multiplicities @xmath58 we get k= _ s c_s",
    "m_s _ s  .",
    "note that since @xmath59 , this anomaly means that the corresponding term in the finite part of the one - loop effective action is _",
    "an = rr^*^-2 _ a^  ,   = k 24 ( 4 ) ^2  .",
    "we shall discuss the structure of this and related terms in the effective action more detail below .",
    "the chiral @xmath2 anomaly of the _ conformal _ gravitino was found in @xcite to be @xmath60 in terms of the anomaly of a single chiral fermion .",
    "this anomaly is related to the anomaly of the standard ( poincar ) gravitino @xcite which is @xmath61 ( in agreement with ( [ an ] ) with @xmath62 ) .",
    "the chiral anomaly of the selfdual tensor @xmath63 can be found , e.g. , by replacing it by a complex transverse vector @xmath64 as @xmath65 ( see sect .",
    "3.2 in @xcite ) and using the result @xcite for the anomaly of the chiral vector in four dimensions .",
    "an alternative way @xcite is to replace @xmath20 by a symmetric product of two two - component left - handed spinors , finding that the anomaly of a single @xmath66 field is @xmath67 .    taking into account the chiral weights @xmath56 and the number @xmath58 of components of each field , the total @xmath2 anomaly count @xmath68 of @xmath13 csg is then @xcite :",
    "a_csg= a__i + a_t + a _ + _ ^i _ + = a_1/2 = 0  , i.e. the pure csg theory has no `` external '' @xmath2 anomaly .",
    "this would formally imply that the global @xmath1 symmetry is preserved in the corresponding quantum theory . however , pure csg has conformal @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite gauge anomalies and thus is inconsistent ( e.g. non - unitarity ) at the quantum level .",
    "let us consider now the system of csg coupled to @xmath69 @xmath13 vector multiplets ( vm ) with fields @xmath70 .",
    "following the conventions of @xcite we shall assume that _ left _",
    "fermions @xmath71 of vm have @xmath2 chiral weight + @xmath72 , i.e. opposite to the one of @xmath73 or the conformal gravitino @xmath74 .",
    "this gives the additional vm contribution to the anomaly as a_vm= n ( + ) ( 4 ) a_1/2 = 2 n a_1/2  ,   a_csg+ vm = a_vm  .",
    "the total anomaly is thus a_csg+ vm = a_vm= 2 n a_1/2  , and it never vanishes for any non - zero number of vms . in particular , the system of @xmath13 csg plus @xmath75 vm that has no conformal @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite gauge anomalies still has @xmath2 gravitational anomaly , implying @xcite the breaking of the rigid @xmath1 symmetry in the combined system at the quantum level . since @xmath1 here acts on the vectors from vm as an on - shell duality rotation , it is present only on equations of motion ( unless one gives up manifest lorentz symmetry and uses doubled formulation ) and in any case it does not survive generalization to non - abelian vm case .      let us now consider the @xmath13 system of @xmath76 vm coupled to csg multiplet but without adding the higher - derivative ( weyl tensor squared + ... ) action of the csg itself . as was argued in @xcite , in the spontaneously - broken phase in which ( at least some of ) the vm scalars have constant vacuum values , this theory is classically equivalent ( upon weyl and s - supersymmetry gauge fixing and solving for the auxiliary fields @xmath77 and @xmath78 which are not propagating here ) to the standard @xmath13 poincar supergravity ( psg ) .",
    "anomalies of @xmath13 psg without any reference to this conformal supergravity construction were discussed in @xcite .",
    "our aim below will be to explain how they can be understood using the above results @xcite about the anomalies of csg + vm system .    in general",
    ", one may expect that there should be anomaly matching between spontaneously broken and unbroken phases . in unbroken phase anomalies of csg and vm",
    "can be counted separately as all massless modes are obvious  only fermions from vm s then contribute to the anomaly ( gravitino , vectors , @xmath79 do not have free kinetic terms ) because the reality of the vm precludes assigning a nonzero @xmath2 charge to the vectors @xcite . in the broken phase we get kinetic terms for the metric , vectors , gravitino and @xmath80 from the vm part , meaning they explicitly contribute . in the broken phase",
    "there is some mode rearrangement but at the end anomalies should match .    in psg the contributions to the gravitational @xmath2 anomaly ( the non - gravitational anomaly is zero because @xmath81 ) come from the gravitini , spinors and vectors .",
    "the chiral weights of gravitino , @xmath82 and @xmath83 in csg setting were @xmath84 ( @xmath83 that had @xmath85 kinetic term in csg becomes physical spinor of @xmath13 psg ) .",
    "these are the same weights used in @xcite , up to overall rescaling by -2 .",
    "since the gravitino is now standard ( not conformal ) its anomaly is @xmath86 ( rather than @xmath87 ) . finally , the contribution of vectors ( or self - dual tensor contribution in @xcite ) is the same as that of self - dual tensor in csg .",
    "thus the total @xmath2 anomaly count is ( cf .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) ) a_psg&= & a_ + a_a + _ _ + & = & ( - ) ( 4 ) 1 a_1/2 + ( -1 ) ( 6 ) 4 a_1/2 + ( - ) ( 4 ) ( -21 ) a_1/2 = 12 a_1/2  .",
    "this is the same ( up to an overall @xmath88 factor due to different normalization of anomaly ) as in @xcite .",
    "this is also exactly the same as the anomaly of @xmath76 @xmath13 vm coupled to csg in ( [ 6 ] ) which should be the anomaly in the unbroken phase .",
    "we can understand this in detail by restoring the csg multiplet contribution ( which is zero ) and then tracking how the anomaly rearrangement takes place in the @xmath13 psg derived following @xcite , i.e. by assuming the broken phase and gauge fixing and solving for the non - dynamical fields . in the broken phase we have :   ( i ) @xmath79 and @xmath89 contribute as before ; ( ii ) gravitino contribution is reduced by -1 from -20 to -21 due to breaking of s - susy ( and solving for non - dynamical fields ) ( iii ) 20 fermions @xmath90 of csg and the rest of @xmath91 fermions of 6 vms should no longer contribute ( they are integrated out or set to zero in the spontaneously broken phase ) .",
    "the count of anomaly in the broken phase then proceeds as follows : & & ( a_csg + a_vm)_br .",
    "= a_ + a_t + 0 a _ + + 0 ( 6 - 1 ) a_^i + & & = ( - ) ( 4 ) a_1/2 + ( -1 ) ( 6 ) 4 a_1/2 + a_1/2 = 12 a_1/2 where the terms in the square brackets represent the standard gravitino contribution , in perfect agreement with direct @xmath13 psg anomaly count ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the conclusion is therefore that the @xmath2 anomaly of @xmath13 psg can be understood as the anomaly in the superconformal phase and that gives an alternative justification of the  claim  of  @xcite .",
    "let conclude this section with some comments on the @xmath26 anomalies .",
    "while the local @xmath26 symmetry is gauge - fixed in the unitary gauge by the condition completely fixing @xcite the vm scalars to be constant or zero in the broken phase , one may ( as in @xcite ) still formally consider `` external '' axial anomaly of the @xmath26 current .",
    "the conclusion of @xcite is that this anomaly is non - vanishing ( but has no real consequences ) .",
    "let us see how to relate the @xmath26 anomaly count in @xmath13 poincar supergravity @xcite to the discussion of the @xmath26 anomaly in the @xmath13 conformal supergravity @xcite , viewing @xcite the @xmath92 psg from the superconformal point of view .    in the pure @xmath13 csg the count of non - abelian @xmath26 anomaly goes as follows @xcite : normalizing the anomaly to the @xmath93 symbols in the fundamental representation , @xmath94 , a left - handed spinor @xmath71 ( or majorana spinor",
    "whose left - handed part transforms in @xmath95 of @xmath26 ) contributes @xmath96 ; then , the csg spinor @xmath83 contributes @xmath44 ; the left - handed gravitino @xmath97 contributes @xmath98 ; @xmath89 does not contribute as the two - index antisymmetric representation of @xmath26 is real ; @xmath99}_k$ ] gives @xmath100 , and thus the total axial gauge anomaly is & & a^(gauge)_csg= a_ + a _ + _ _ = ( -1 ) a_1/2 + ( -7 ) a_1/2 + 4 a_1/2 = -4 a_1/2  , + & &   a_1/2= 1 24 ( 4)^2 ( ff^ * )  . if we add coupling to @xmath30 of @xmath13 vms with the left - handed spinor @xmath71 being in representation @xmath95 of @xmath26 ( like the gravitini ) , then a^(gauge)_vm= n a_1/2  ,    a^(gauge)_csg + a^(gauge)_vm= ( n-4 ) a_1/2  .",
    "thus for @xmath75 we have the cancellation of the @xmath26 anomaly while for @xmath76 we have the anomaly equal to @xmath101 .",
    "let us now compare this with the count of @xmath26 anomaly in @xmath13 psg @xcite interpreted as a superconformal system in the broken phase @xcite with all extra gauge symmetries fixed .",
    "here we have the same four spinors @xmath83 in the fundamental representation of @xmath26 and the same gravitino @xmath97 , but no spinors @xmath102 . the standard gravitino contribution to the gauge anomaly",
    "is proportional to the helicity so it should have relative factor of 3 compared to the chiral spin 1/2 fermion .",
    "this implies a^(gauge)_psg= a_ + _ _ = ( -1 ) a_1/2 + 3 a_1/2 = 2 a_1/2  .",
    "this reproduces the count of the @xmath26 anomaly in conformal supergravity in ( [ 10 ] ) for @xmath76 .      in the case",
    "when csg is coupled to @xmath104 rather than just six vector multiplets , i.e. to extra @xmath103 `` matter '' multiplets , the anomaly relation ( [ ta ] ) does not directly apply .",
    "indeed , the matter vms surviving as dynamical fields in the broken phase may acquire different @xmath2 charges than the ones assumed in the unbroken phase . as",
    "the chiral weights should be consistent also with the supersymmetry of the psg theory , a way to fix them is to use that for @xmath105 the resulting psg + matter theory can be interpreted as a truncation of @xmath11 supergravity .",
