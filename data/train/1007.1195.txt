    "the hubbard model in two spatial dimensions plays a central role in the modern theory of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "since it is believed to be a good microscopic model for the underlying physics of high @xmath10 superconductivity ( htsc)@xcite , it has been studied extensively over the past two decades .",
    "a partial list of publications on the thermodynamics of the hubbard model is @xcite .",
    "despite this effort , many of its important properties are not currently well - understood , and it remains to be established definitively that it possesses all of the main features of htsc .",
    "for instance , the precise mechanism that leads to attractive d - wave pairing , which must arise from the purely electronic coulomb repulsion , is still not well understood .",
    "analytic methods to date are rather limited since the model is in the strong coupling regime .",
    "lattice monte - carlo methods on the other hand are limited to small lattices and suffer from the fermion sign problem , especially at non - zero doping and sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "for these reasons , any new analytic methods , though approximate , may shed new light on the problem .    in this work we present an analytic approach to the thermodynamics of particles at finite density and temperature based on the reformulation of the statistical mechanics of particles in terms of the _ zero temperature and density _ particle - particle s - matrix developed in @xcite .",
    "as explained there , the potential advantage of this method is that , unlike the usual diagramatic matsubara approach to finite temperature field theory , it disentangles the zero temperature dynamics from the quantum statistical sums .",
    "some remarks clarifying the nature of this formalism , and the approximations made , are called for .",
    "the approach was modeled after the thermodynamic bethe ansatz@xcite , which is exact for integrable models in one spatial dimension since the n - body s - matrix factorizes into 2-body s - matrices , our method indeed reduces to the thermodynamic bethe ansatz in the two - body scattering approximation , as shown in @xcite for the interacting 1d bose gas .",
    "the main approximation we make is that we consider only many - body processes that involve arbitrary numbers of primitive binary collisions .",
    "i.e. we neglect processes that in some sense involve 3 or more particles colliding simultaneously , which is not the same as ignoring the many - body aspect of the problem altogether . in this non - relativistic context , it is well - known that the two - body s - matrix can be calculated exactly , thus in some regards the method is non - perturbative .",
    "although this is not a fully controlled approximation , it has been demonstrated to give reliable results for other strong - coupling problems , in particular the critical point of the 2d bosonic gas and more importantly to bose and fermi gases in the 3d scale - invariant unitary limit@xcite .",
    "for instance for the unitary fermi gas on the bec side of the crossover , the critical temperature calculated is consistent with monte - carlo methods , and the ratio of the viscosity to entropy density agrees very well with the most recent experimental data@xcite . it should be pointed out that the exact bethe - ansatz solution of the 1d hubbard model exhibits two additional holon excitations@xcite , which can be inferred from poles in the s - matrix of the fundamental fermions ; we have no evidence for such excitations in the 2-dimensional case , thus it is unclear whether a meaningful comparison with the 1d case can be made .",
    "our conventions for the hubbard model are described in the next section .",
    "we include a next nearest neighbor hopping term of strength @xmath0 , since it is known to be non - zero in the cuprates ; as we will show , its effects are important . in section iii ,",
    "the effective momentum dependent coupling , which is the kernel @xmath11 constructed from the logarithm of the 2-body s - matrix in the integral equation satisfied by the pseudo - energy , is analyzed .",
    "we show that there exists a band of attractive interactions near the half - filled fermi surface for @xmath12 large enough , and @xmath0 plays an important role in determining this property .",
    "we emphasize that no approximations are made in section iii , since , as stated above , the 2-body s - matrix can be calculated exactly , and this attractive region exists regardless of the subsequent approximations we make in studying the thermodynamics .",
    "this attractive mechanism , which arises from quantum loop corrections , appears to be different than other mechanisms discussed in this context , such as those based on spin fluctuations or the resonating valence bond picture .",
    "it is thus important to investigate the consequences of these attractive interactions and how they might be connected to htsc , and this paper is a first step in this direction . in section",
    "iv the s - matrix based formalism we utilize for calculating thermodynamic properties is reviewed and specialized to the hubbard gas . in section v the free energy is analyzed , and we present some evidence for phase transitions .",

    "in this section we study the main features of the kernel and demonstrate that there are regions of the brillouin zone where the interactions are effectively attractive , even though the bare model has repulsive interactions .",
    "we we wish to emphasize that no approximations are made in obtaining the results presented in this section , which essentially amount to quantum corrections to scattering , and some conclusions are independent of the thermodynamics studied in subsequent sections .",

    "thus , the effective interactions can be repulsive or attractive , depending on which side of the fixed point one sits , even though the bare model defined by the hamiltonian had only repulsive interactions .",
    "the main difference in the hubbard gas is that the renormalized coupling depends on the momenta , so that the interactions may become attractive in distinct regions of the brillouin zone .",
    "we mention that a change in sign of certain couplings under renormalization group flow was found for a 2-chain hubbard model ( 2-legged ladder ) in @xcite .",

    "@xmath129 then corresponds to hole doping when it is positive , otherwise it represents particle doping .",
    "more precisely , @xmath129 is the number of holes per plaquette and the lattice is completely depopulated at @xmath172 .    in order to probe the properties of the model , we will need a few other thermodynamic quantities . as usual the pressure @xmath173 .",
    "consider first the entropy per particle , @xmath174 , where the entropy density @xmath175 .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the scaling functions as follows : [ sn ] = @xmath176 the energy density @xmath177 .",
    "thus the energy per particle is [ enperpart ] = = + c    the specific heat per particle @xmath178 at constant volume and particle number @xmath179 is slightly more complicated since one must impose the constant density constraint .",

    "in this section we analyze the thermodynamics based on the formulas of the last section , provide evidence for instabilities , which may perhaps be phase transitions , and estimate critical temperatures .    in order to study the free energy ,",
    "one must first solve the integral equation ( [ pseudointeq ] ) for the pseudo - energy @xmath153 .",
    "this can be done iteratively , i.e. one starts with the approximation @xmath184 and plugs this into the right hand side to generate @xmath185 ; this procedure is repeated until the solution converges .",
    "we approximated the integral equation by approximating the brillouin zone as a @xmath186 grid , and performing the integrals as discrete sums .",
    "this is rather crude , and was due to our limited computing resources ; certainly one can do better .",
    "it was found that for large portions of the @xmath187 parameter space , the iterative procedure converged rapidly , typically within 10 iterations .    for reasons stated above",
    ", our analysis was performed for @xmath188 , and @xmath23 . for fixed doping @xmath129 ,",
    "the chemical potential depends on temperature , but we find this dependence to be weak . in figure [ hofmu ]",
    "we plot hole doping @xmath129 as a function of chemical potential at the low temperature @xmath189 , and it is nearly a straight line . as expected , increased doping corresponds to decreasing chemical potential ; half filling occurs around @xmath190 .",

    "the computed fermi surfaces for various hole doping are shown in figure [ fermisurface ] . in this figure",
    "they are defined as the contour where the filling fraction @xmath191 at the low temperature @xmath192 .",
    "they are in good agreement with experiments@xcite , especially in the anti - nodal directions , whereas in the nodal directions they are pulled back toward the center in a more pronounced manner in the data .",
    "this can likely be accounted for by adding additional hopping terms , such as next - to - next nearest neighbor .",
    "the most interesting feature of the integral equation ( [ pseudointeq ] ) is that there are regions in @xmath187 where the iterative procedure does not lead to a solution for an arbitarily high number of iterations ; the procedure leads to @xmath153 that jumps successively between two values , neither of which are solutions .",
    "( figure [ yesint ] . )",
    "let us assume that in these regions , no solution exists , although our observations do not necessarily prove this .",
    "furthermore , let us adopt the following physical interpretation .",
    "by comparison , in the standard bcs theory of superconductivity , one has a finite temperature gap equation .",
    "as the temperature is raised , at the critical temperature there are no longer solutions to this gap equation ; i.e. as far temperature is concerned , it is a bottom up approach .",
    "in contrast , the present formalism is a top down approach : as the temperature is lowered one reaches a critical temperature where solutions no longer exist .",
    "let us interpret this as an instability toward formation of a new phase , or perhaps a cross - over to a different behaviour .",
    "in support of this interpretation , we mention the treatment of the unitary bose gas within the present formalism@xcite .",
    "the gas undergoes a phase transition to a bose - einstein condensate at a critical value of @xmath193 ; above this value there are no solutions to the pseudo - energy integral equation .",
    "it should be emphasized that the true nature of this ` phase ' can not be surmised from our thermodynamic approach alone ; in addition one needs a bottom up approach that contains information about the zero temperature ground state , such as a gap equation .",
    "such a complementary bottom up approach is developed in @xcite , where solutions to a bcs - like gap equation based on the attractive interactions described in section iii are studied .",
    "the solutions are highly anisotropic , in that they vanish in the nodal directions , and are largest in the anti - nodal , and the critical @xmath194 found there for @xmath195 is consistent with the critical temperatures estimated below .",
    "figure [ yesint ] indicates the regions where solutions do not exist for positive hole doping @xmath196 . this figure is a contour plot of an interpolating function defined to be equal to 1 if there is a solution , and zero otherwise",
    "; the white region indicates the region of no solution , whereas in the light blue region , solutions exist .",
    "the boundary between the regions of existence and non - existence of solutions are the darkest curves , which are reasonably well delineated . due to the 2-body approximation we have made in the thermodynamics ,",
    "this boundary is not to be taken as precisely determined .",
    "the roughness of the boundaries we believe is a numerical artifact , mainly attributed to not using a fine enough grid in the temperature and chemical potential variables .",
    "the dip around @xmath195 we also believe to be an artifact since it disappears upon varying @xmath40 and @xmath0 . in the range of doping @xmath197 one sees a possible phase transition with critical temperatures ranging from @xmath198 . as explained in section iii , since this is the range of doping where the fermi surface is intersecting the attractive band in the anti - nodal directions , we propose that this signifies an instability toward the formation of cooper pairs , so that superconductivity may occur in the white regions . at",

    "one clearly sees a drop at @xmath202 .     in the anti - nodal direction @xmath203 at optimal hole doping @xmath195 as a function of temperature .",
    ", width=377 ]    [ vep.15 ]    the higher @xmath10 s up to @xmath204 in the strongly underdoped region possibly signify the so - called pseudogap scale @xmath205 .",
    "there appears to be a small separation around @xmath206 , however this is less pronounced for other @xmath40 , so it is not clear if this signifies anything .",
    "some recent experimental results are very relevant to the issue @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it was found that the superconducting gap smoothly evolves into the pseudogap , i.e. they both seem to arise from the same underlying mechanism . in other words",
    "the gap is physically present even in regions of no superconductivity .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath10 s in figure [ yesint ] may all be arising from the same underlying phenomenon .",
    "this is consistent with the complimentary gap equation analysis in @xcite , where it was found that the gap extends and increases all the way to zero doping , as does the critical temperature scale in figure [ yesint ] .",
    "although not shown in figure [ yesint ] , at higher doping there is another region of no - solutions with a maximum @xmath207 .",
    "this could perhaps signify the temperature referred to as @xmath208 in the literature , where a crossover in the resistivity is observed from @xmath209 to @xmath210@xcite .",
    "we turn next to the thermodynamic functions , such as energy and entropy per particle . for hole densities in the vicinity of the boundaries shown in figure [ yesint ] ,",
    "our crude solution to the integral equation for the pseudo - energy is not smooth enough to reliably compute temperature derivatives numerically .",
    "however , at low density our numerical results are better behaved , and although of less interest physically for the cuprates , at least allow a comparison with previous literature .",
    "we therefore analyzed the thermodynamics in the overdoped region , with @xmath211 .",
    "the fermi surface is shown in figure [ fs.8 ] . in figures",
    "[ energy ] , [ entropy ] and [ specificheat ] , we plot the energy and entropy per particle and specific heat as a function of temperature .",
    "our results for the entropy and specific heat are roughly consistent with the results in @xcite , especially the results in @xcite , which extend to low density ; a detailed comparison is beyond reach since previous results are typically at higher temperatures .     at temperature @xmath189 .",

    "we presented an analytic treatment of the two - dimensional hubbard model at finite chemical potential and temperature based on a new approach to statistical mechanics we recently developed@xcite , which is built upon the s - matrix .",
    "the effective momentum - dependent coupling in this approach is the kernel @xmath59 of an integral equation satisfied by the pseudo - energy @xmath153 , which is built on the exact two - body s - matrix .",
    "we showed that there are regions of the brillouin zone where the interactions are effectively attractive , for example , @xmath102 for @xmath23 , even though the bare model only has repulsive interactions , and this is essentially due to multi - loop quantum corrections . the next - to - nearest neighbor hopping coupling @xmath0 plays a significant role in determining this property , and",
    "our analysis suggests that for a fixed value of @xmath1 , superconductivity may not exist for @xmath4 .",
    "we emphasize that no approximations were made in obtaining these results ; e.g. the existence of a threshold in @xmath1 for the existence of certain attractive interactions , stands on its own and is independent of the subsequent approximations we made in the thermodynamics .",
    "we postulated that phase transitions occur where there are no solutions of the integral equation for the pseudo - energy . on the overdoped side",
    ", this phase sets in at hole doping @xmath196 .",
    "our result for @xmath214 at @xmath195 is in good agreement with experiments .",
    "we found that there is also evidence for transitions in the underdoped region , and we suggested this signifies the pseudogap .",
    "the main lesson of this work is that quantum loop corrections to scattering are perhaps the origin of the attractive interactions that lead to cooper pairing near the fermi surface . if this idea is correct , then in order to complete the picture one needs to derive a gap - equation that describes the structure of the ground state at zero temperature .",
    "some preliminary attempts in this direction were taken in @xcite , where solutions to a gap equation based on the attractive interactions described above are studied , and the critical temperatures found are consistent with the bottom down approach described in this paper .",
    "based on the detailed properties of the solutions to the gap equation studied there , i.e. its anisotropy and the existence of fermi arcs in the nodal direction , it was suggested that the attractive mechanism in this paper may be responsible for the pseudogap rather than d - wave superconductivity .",
