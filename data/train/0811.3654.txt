    "the galaxy group awm  5 ( albert et al . 1977 ) is an x - ray luminous nearby group ( @xmath23 ) with @xmath24 erg s@xmath19 ( jones & forman 1999 ) .",
    "the cd galaxy ngc  6269 lies at the group center and at the peak of the x - ray surface brightness distribution .",
    "ngc  6269 contains a weak central radio source ( @xmath25 mjy ) with north - south radio lobes ( @xmath0 and @xmath5 mjy ) extending 25@xmath26 from the center ( burns et al .",
    "1981 , giacintucci et al . 2007 ) .",
    "ngc  6269 dominates the optical light from awm  5 .",
    "since the group member ngc  6265 is only @xmath27 mags fainter than ngc  6269 and is located at @xmath28  kpc ( in the plane of the sky ) from the center , awm  5 does not strictly follow the criteria of jones et al .",

    ". however projection effects may increase in principle the distance between the two galaxies pushing it over the half a virial radius limit . moreover",
    "the velocity difference ( perpendicularly to the plane of the sky ) between ngc  6265 and ngc  6269 is quite high ( @xmath29 km s@xmath19 ) , therefore ngc  6265 is almost certainly not a resident of the group core . in any case",
    "ngc  6269 clearly dominates the optical light in awm  5 . although it does not meet the formal definition of a fossil group given in jones et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , awm  5 is a system with a dominant central galaxy , making it a group well suitable for a comparison with both `` fossil '' and normal groups . in a hierarchical universe , smaller systems collapse and virialize at an earlier stage than more massive systems .",
    "although smaller density fluctuations also can generate groups of galaxies at later epochs , dense groups should be generally older , more dynamically evolved systems than clusters of galaxies . in galaxy groups",
    ", galaxy mergers can occur very efficiently because of their low velocity dispersions , comparable in some cases to the internal velocity dispersion of the individual member galaxies . in an old , relatively isolated group with little subsequent infall",
    ", there may be sufficient time for most massive galaxies ( but not all the low mass galaxies ) to lose energy via dynamical friction and merge , producing a system consisting of a giant central elliptical galaxy , dwarf galaxies and extended x - ray / dark matter halos .",
    "this is one of the proposed scenarios for the formation of giant isolated elliptical galaxies and it is based on the galactic cannibalism discussed by hausman & ostriker ( 1978 ) .",
    "the observation of `` fossil '' groups ( ponman et al .",
    "1994 ) provides clear evidence for the above mechanism .",
    "numerical simulations ( barnes 1989 ) suggested that a few billion years are required for compact group members to merge and form a single elliptical galaxy .    presently , about a dozen such systems are identified ( e.g. ponman et al .",

    "2004 , sun et al . 2004 ) . in a 160 deg@xmath30 rosat pspc survey ,",
    "vikhlinin et al . ( 1999 ) found four such objects .",
    "computing the volume covered by their survey , they estimated that `` fossil '' groups represent @xmath31 of all clusters and groups with @xmath32  ergs s@xmath19 .",
    "consistent results were obtained by jones et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who , using a precise definition of such a system , found that `` fossil '' groups represent a sizeable percentage ( 8%-20% ) of all systems with comparable x - ray luminosities , and are as numerous as poor and rich clusters combined . + more recently khosroshahi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , using chandra x - ray observations and optical data of a flux - limited sample of five fossil groups ( plus additional systems from the literature ) , studied in detail the scaling properties of fossils compared to normal groups and clusters .",
    "considering groups having the same optical luminosity , they found that fossils are generally more x - ray luminous than non - fossil groups . in their sample , however , fossil groups follow the conventional @xmath33-@xmath34 relation of galaxy groups and clusters , suggesting that the x - ray luminosity and the gas temperature are both increased , as a consequence of their early formation .",
    "they also found other signatures of their early epoch of formation such as the higher mass concentration in fossils than in non - fossils , and the @xmath35-@xmath34 relation , suggesting that fossils are hotter for a given total gravitational mass .",
    "the explanation they give for the difference between fossil and non - fossil properties is that the cuspy potential well in fossils tends to raise the luminosity and temperature of their inter - galactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "however , this works together with the lower gas entropy ( especially in lower mass systems ) compared to normal groups , which could arise from less effective pre - heating of the gas in fossils . another likely effect of the early shock heating of the igm is that galaxy formation efficiency is quite low in fossil systems , as suggested by the high mass - to - light ratios observed .    in this paper , we describe the results from a chandra observation of the galaxy group awm  5 , dominated by the central galaxy ngc  6269 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the chandra data preparation and the analysis method in  2 .",
    "we present the results coming from the x - ray morphology and spectral analysis of the diffuse gas in  3 , comparing the optical - ir properties of the galaxies in the group with their x - ray properties in  4 .",
    "we discuss the results and their implications in  5 .",
    "the `` stripped '' galaxy ngc  6265 falling into the group is described in  6 , and the conclusions of the paper are drawn in  7 .",
    "all the uncertainties are 1@xmath36 ( 68% ) for one interesting parameter , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the abundance estimates are relative to the cosmic values given in anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) . throughout this paper",

    "awm  5 was observed by the acis - i detector on - board chandra on 2003 , december 29 for a total of 40  ks ( obsid : 4972 ) .",
    "the chandra data analysis has been performed using ciao v3.4 , which applies the newest acis gain maps , the time - dependent acis gain correction , and the acis charge transfer inefficiency correction .",
    "the background light curve during the observation was examined to detect periods of high background following markevitch et al .",
    "( 2003a ) ; no significant flaring episodes were detected , giving a total good integration time of @xmath42  ks .",
    "since the awm  5 group fills most of the chandra field of view , we use the blank - field observations , processed identically to the group observation ( i.e. as described above ) and reprojected onto the sky using the aspect information from the group pointing .",
    "we renormalized the blank - fields to the background of the observation , using the acis - s2 chip , in a region of the acis field of view practically free from group emission . to perform the normalization",

    "we followed the procedure of vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , to check if the diffuse soft x - ray background could be an important background component in our observation .",
    "we extracted a spectrum from the source - free regions of the detector ( again the s2 chip ) , subtracted the renormalized blank - field background and fit the background subtracted spectrum in xspec v11.3.2p ( in the 0.4 - 1 kev band ) with an unabsorbed mekal model , whose normalization was allowed to be negative .",
    "the residuals were found to be negligible and consistent with zero , suggesting that an additional soft background correction is not necessary for our dataset .",

    "the x - ray tailed galaxy ngc  6265 ( a member of the awm  5 group ) is visible on the far west of the image and is the only other group member associated with extended x - ray emission .",
    "we performed a radial analysis of the diffuse x - ray emission to determine its properties .",
    "we used ciao @xmath43 to identify all the 3@xmath36 point sources and excluded them from the image . to extract a radial profile we used circular annuli of increasing thickness ( from @xmath44 to @xmath45 ) , out to @xmath46 .",
    "we also computed an exposure map of the observation .",
    "the exposure map values were averaged inside each annulus and renormalized to the exposure time in the central annulus .",
    "the background subtracted exposure corrected surface brightness profile of awm  5 is plotted in figure  [ sbprofile ] .",
    "a break in the slope of the surface brightness profile is visible in the plot , at @xmath5 kpc from the group center .",
    "the surface brightness is well fit at all radii by two @xmath8 models having core radii of @xmath47 kpc and @xmath48 kpc in the inner ( @xmath49 kpc ) and the outer part ( @xmath50 kpc ) respectively ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the corresponding best fit values of @xmath8 are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .    to check for anisotropies in the x - ray emission we extracted radial profiles in four azimuthal sectors ( see fig .",

    "the central region is excluded to avoid contamination from the group cooling core ( cc ) .",
    "the spectra were fitted in xspec v11.3.2p with a single temperature mekal model , with galactic absorption ( @xmath60 @xmath61 ; stark et al .",
    "1992 ) leaving the metal abundance free to vary .",
    "the values of @xmath59 and @xmath57 are evaluated iteratively until convergence to a stable value of the temperature is obtained ( @xmath62 kev between two different iterations ) .",
    "the best fit temperature was @xmath63 kev , while the best fit metallicity was @xmath64 @xmath65 .",
    "the virial radius estimated from eq .  [ eqn1 ] for awm  5 is @xmath66  mpc .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity observed within the emission region ( @xmath67 kpc ) is @xmath68 erg s@xmath19 . at @xmath69 ( 1.03 mpc ) and at @xmath57",
    "the total luminosities , extrapolated from the surface brightness @xmath8 model fit (   [ radanal ] ) , are @xmath70 erg s@xmath19 and @xmath71 erg s@xmath19 , respectively .",
    "to study the physical properties of the group emission , we subdivided the emission from the group into annuli centered on the x - ray peak .",
    "we required @xmath72 net counts in each of the central annuli ( @xmath73 kpc ) , and @xmath74 net counts in each of the outer annuli ( @xmath75 kpc ) , where the surface brightness is lower and the contribution from the background is higher .",
    "we extracted a spectrum from each annulus ( excluding point sources ) using @xmath76 , which generates source and background spectra and builds appropriate rmfs and arfs .",
    "the background is taken from the re - normalized blank field observations using the same region as the source .",
    "the spectra were analyzed with xspec v11.3.2p ( arnaud et al .",
    "1996 ) and fitted with a single - temperature mekal model ( kaastra 1992 ; liedahl et al .",
    "the free parameters in the model are the gas temperature @xmath77 , the gas metallicity @xmath78 and the normalization .",
    "the spectral band considered is 0.5 - 4 kev .",
    "all the spectra were rebinned to have at least 20 counts per bin .",
    "we have measured @xmath79 from the x - ray data , finding it consistent ( within 1@xmath36 ) with the galactic value along the line of sight , as derived from radio data ( @xmath60 @xmath61 ; stark et al .",
    "since the presence of agn activity in the center of awm  5 is very likely , we have tried to add an additional power - law component to the thermal model in the central annulus .",
    "the fit is not improved significantly by the presence of the additional spectral component ( @xmath80 ) and the contribution of a power - law is @xmath81% of the thermal component .",
    "we also considered an image in the 3 - 8 kev band , finding that no hard point - like emission is present both in the chandra 40ks observation and in an off - axis xmm archival observation ( centered on ngc  6264 , pi : greenhill ) .",
    "the projected temperature and abundance profiles of awm  5 are shown in figure  [ ktz ] .    the temperature profile shows the presence of an @xmath828  kpc - sized cc ( projected @xmath83 kev ; de - projected @xmath84 ) with the profile having a peak just outside the core and then declining from @xmath85  kev to @xmath3  kev at larger radii .",
    "the abundance profile is suggestive of a `` hole '' in the center coincident with the cc .",
    "the abundance value rises just outside the core reaching a maximum of a few times solar at a radius of @xmath6  kpc and then declines to subsolar values .",
    "the probability that the value of the abundance is the same in the inner two bins and that the `` hole '' is produced by statistical fluctuations is @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the projected and deprojected case , respectively .",
    "similar behaviour is observed in other groups and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. perseus cluster ; schmidt et al .",
    "2002 ; churazov et al .",
    "2001 ; 2002 ) and was observed in `` fossil '' groups ( e.g. eso 3060170 ; sun et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we also examined the radial variation of si , s and mg fitting a vmekal single temperature model to the radial annuli .",
    "the fe and mg abundance show a trend very similar to what was observed in the metal abundance profile in the mekal fit . on the other hand s and si abundances",
    "are constant within the errors , although the large statistical errors can not exclude that these abundances could follow the same radial trend as the other metals .",
    "the data quality does not allow a direct comparison of the snia and snii product yields with the results coming from the study of rasmussen & ponman ( 2007 ) on a large sample of galaxy groups .",
    "the electron density profile can be obtained by deprojecting the surface brightness profile ( see e.g. david et al .",
    "2001 ; sun et al .",
    "based on the rosat all - sky survey , we determined that the flux contribution from regions beyond the outermost bin ( @xmath88 ) is not significant .",
    "thus the `` onion - peeling '' technique adopted starts in the outer annulus , converting the observed background - subtracted and exposure - corrected 0.5 - 4 kev surface brightness profile ( derived in 22 radial bins ) to electron density . in each bin ,",
    "an emissivity for the gas at a fixed temperature @xmath77 and @xmath78 is computed for a standard mekal model to perform the conversion .",
    "the procedure determines the density at progressively smaller radii , subtracting the projected emission from larger radii . in the temperature range observed in the projected profile of awm  5 ( @xmath89 kev ) ,",
    "the x - ray emissivity is sensitive to both abundance and temperature .",
    "therefore , with the assumption of spherical symmetry , we first performed a spectral deprojection to obtain the 3d temperature and abundance profiles ( fig .",
    "[ ktz ] ) .",
    "only six radial bins were considered for the spectral deprojection . because of the steep temperature gradient observed in the core of awm  5 we chose a broken power - law model to fit @xmath77 .",
    "a second order polynomial was chosen to model the radial dependence of the abundance .",
    "we varied the values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 within their @xmath90 uncertainties , through 1000 monte carlo simulations to obtain the @xmath90 errors on the best - fit parameters of the fits to the @xmath77 and @xmath78 profiles .",
    "the statistical errors in the electron density were determined by combining the uncertainties in the x - ray emissivity and in the surface brightness profiles .",
    "the missing emission volume in each annulus because of the chip edges , gaps and point sources was derived by monte carlo simulations and included in the computation of the errors as well .",

    "the inner @xmath8-model ( at @xmath94  kpc ) has best fit values of : @xmath9 ; @xmath10  kpc ) .",

    "the slope measured for the density profile is very similar to that observed in cool groups ( e.g. ngc1550 , sun et al .",
    "2003 ) but much flatter than those measured in `` fossil '' groups ( e.g. ngc6482 , khosroshahi et al . 2004 ; eso3060170 , sun et al .",
    "2004 ) and in clusters , where generally n@xmath96 r@xmath98 beyond several core radii . with the deprojected electron density profile , we were also able to derive the cooling time and entropy profiles ( defined as @xmath99 ; fig .",
    "[ tc_entr ] ) .",
    "the cooling time is less than 10@xmath100 yr in the very center and less than a hubble time ( @xmath82 10@xmath101 yr ) within the central 30 kpc .      as described in",
    "  [ intro ] , awm  5 hosts a weak central radio source ( fig .",
    "[ radioimg ] ) .",
    "the two lobes seem to be coincident with a depression in the x - ray emission , observed especially in the southern lobe . however the chandra data are not sufficiently deep to perform any detailed analysis on such cavities .    from the geometrical properties of the radio lobes and the density and temperature ( and hence pressure ) profiles derived above we can determine some of their physical parameters .",
    "the calculations derived in this section refer to the northern radio lobe , however the two lobes are quite symmetric and we can consider these numbers valid also for the southern lobe .",
    "the northern lobe shape can be approximated with a sphere with a @xmath102 radius ( @xmath103  kpc ) .",
    "we assume that the lobe rose buoyantly at half the speed of sound ( e.g. as in m  87 , churazov et al .",
    "at the temperature of the cc of awm  5 , @xmath104  kev , the speed of sound is @xmath105 km s@xmath19 , the rise time of the lobe and hence the age is therefore @xmath106 yr , consistent with the radiative age @xmath107 derived by giacintucci et al .",
    "the energy necessary to inflate the lobe can be calculated as 4@xmath108 ( @xmath109 is the local hot gas pressure since the lobe is supposed to be in pressure equilibrium , and @xmath110 is the volume of the lobe itself ) and is @xmath111 erg .",
    "therefore the power necessary to inflate the lobe in @xmath106 yr is @xmath112 erg s@xmath19 .",
    "this number is two orders of magnitude higher than the x - ray upper limit we obtain for the agn at the center of ngc  6269 . if we estimate the mechanical luminosity of the rising bubble as @xmath113 ( brzan et al .",
    "2004 ) , where @xmath114 is the age of the bubble , we obtain @xmath115  erg s@xmath19 .",
    "this can also be compared with a total radio luminosity of @xmath116  erg s@xmath19 ( see   [ reheat ] ) , in agreement with the @xmath117 relation derived by brzan et al .",

    "if the radio - lobes are not parallel to the plane of the sky the estimates performed above will be different .",
    "in particular , if we name @xmath124 the inclination angle of the lobe axis with respect to the plane of the sky , the volume of the bubble will be increased by a factor @xmath125 and so the energy necessary to inflate the bubble . however , unless we are dealing with a very extreme inclination angle , the estimates computed in this section can be considered reliable within a factor of a few .",

    "a single nfw fit can not account for the shape of the mass profile at all radii .",
    "this can be explained by superposition of two halos of dark matter from the group and from the central galaxy ngc  6269 .",
    "moreover complications could be introduced by the radio source ( which could be more extended than visible in the first ) and by the presence of a steep gradient in temperature .",
