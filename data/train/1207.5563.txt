    "magnetically mediated superconductivity in heavy - electron systems , specifically ce and u compounds , has been known to exist for over 30 years.@xcite among the known heavy fermion superconductors a particularly rich family includes the so - called `` 115 , '' `` 127 , '' and `` 218 '' structures which are all variants of the `` 103 '' parent compound , crystallizing in the ho@xmath10co@xmath11ga@xmath12 architecture ( see fig .  [ structure]).@xcite many of these compounds",
    "are known to be superconducting.@xcite it is widely expected that in these systems , spin fluctuations are what bind the cooper pairs , and the balance between these local - moment fluctuations and long - range magnetism in the vicinity of a quantum critical point is crucial for superconductivity to take place .",
    "there are however compounds that belong in this structural family but do not superconduct , as they tend to shy away from this ideal balance .",
    "for example , the @xmath6  electrons in the u-115s , -218s , and np-115s are too itinerant to exhibit superconductivity,@xcite and in amcoga@xmath7 they are too localized.@xcite cerhin@xmath7 , cept@xmath0in@xmath1 , and ce@xmath0rhin@xmath13 , all nonsuperconducting antiferromagnets at ambient pressure , require compression to delocalize the @xmath6  electrons and make them available for electron - electron pairing.@xcite pu - based compounds are particularly interesting , because within the actinides it is pu that straddles the line between bearing localized and itinerant @xmath14 electron states .",
    "pu compounds are often considered the hole analog of their ce counterparts because they have five @xmath6 electrons in the @xmath15 spin - orbit split multiplet .",
    "in fact , the two 115 subgroups manifest very similar behaviors from their curie  weiss - like magnetic susceptibilities@xcite to their quasi - two - dimensional fermi surfaces ( fss).@xcite the in - bearing members show remarkably similar properties as well : puin@xmath16 is a 14  k antiferromagnet,@xcite while cein@xmath16 is a 10  k antiferromagnet,@xcite and pucoin@xmath7 and cecoin@xmath7 are both 2  k superconductors.@xcite why the @xmath17 s of the pucoga@xmath7 and purhga@xmath7 superconductors are so much higher however remains elusive .",
    "based on the impressive list of superconductors discovered in the past 25 years with two - dimensional ( 2d ) structures and properties , a guideline can be made that some aspects of 2d structures make them more favorable for superconductivity and will therefore give rise to a higher @xmath17 .",
    "the average spin fluctuation frequency is higher in quasi-2d systems than 3d , and this brings about a larger cooper pairing energy.@xcite indeed , the purh@xmath18co@xmath19ga@xmath7 ( @xmath20 ) compounds with @xmath17 values up to 18 k follow a linear relation in @xmath17 vs.  the axial ratio @xmath21,@xcite which is also observed in ce@xmath22in@xmath7 ( and , interestingly , with an almost identical slope to that of pu - based cousins).@xcite recently , cept@xmath0in@xmath1a structurally and electronically more 2d version of 115was discovered.@xcite although @xmath17 was not enhanced , it did achieve a maximum superconducting transition temperature of 2.1  k , comparable to the other ce - based 115s.    in this paper , we report the discovery of the pu analog to cept@xmath0in@xmath1 . we find that pupt@xmath0in@xmath1 is a mass enhanced paramagnet which lacks superconductivity down to 2  k. we report electronic structure calculations on pupt@xmath0in@xmath1 , including densities of states , band structures , and fermi surfaces .",
    "we present also analogous analyses on isovalent pupt@xmath0ga@xmath1 , which has yet to be synthesized .",
    "in addition , we have calculated the constant - matrix - element and atomic - character - matrix - element noninteracting magnetic susceptibilities of pupt@xmath0in@xmath1 and pupt@xmath0ga@xmath1 , and of pucoga@xmath7 and pucoin@xmath7 as points of comparison . while the fermi surfaces of the 127 compounds are qualitatively distinct from the 115s , all four pu compounds exhibit a row of peaks in the susceptibility along the @xmath8 direction at @xmath9 .",

    "this indeed demonstrates that the 127 compounds are electronically more anisotropic than the 115 compounds .",
    "in addition , the ga compounds , despite their smaller structure , are slightly more 2d than their in analogs .",
    "if , as in the case of the ce - based superconductors , the presence of superconductivity relies on the proximity to an antiferromagnetic state , we would like to know the relative degree of localization in the various pu-115 , -127 , and -218 compounds . from the dft calculations , we can get an estimate for the relative strength of the @xmath5-@xmath6 hybridization .",
    "we take the @xmath6-electron density within the pu muffin - tin sphere to be inversely related to the strength of hybridization . for identically sized mt spheres ( 3.1 ) , we find @xmath6-occupations of 5.24 for both pucoin@xmath7 and pupt@xmath0in@xmath1 and 5.14 for both pucoga@xmath7 and pupt@xmath0ga@xmath1 .",
    "thus , we obtain that the in compounds are less hybridized than the ga analogs .",
    "this result alone does not indicate the degree of localization .",

    "the role of the electronic structure in determining superconductivity depends on the mechanism .",
    "it has been argued that in some cases , superconductivity can be driven by fermi surface nesting .",
    "nesting , which indicates instability in the fs , can give rise to a spin density wave or charge density wave . in a bcs - like mechanism ,",
    "even if the pairing fluctuations do not originate directly from a fs instability , the electronic structure will at a minimum determine the superconducting gap symmetry , as well as the character of the interaction .",

[ suscs ] ) . in the interest of finding nesting features that are unique to the superconductors , we calculated the susceptibilities of pucoga@xmath7 and pucoin@xmath7 as well .",
    "the generalized susceptibility is @xmath58 where @xmath6 denotes the fermi distribution function , @xmath59 is the energy dispersion , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are band indices . alongside the conventional @xmath62 , we also calculated the susceptibility incorporating the relative weight of the pu @xmath6  orbital , so as to pick out the attributes dominated by pu @xmath6  character .",

    "the virtually identical fermi surfaces , @xmath62 plots , and @xmath63 plots at the dft level for pucoin@xmath7 and pucoga@xmath7 whose superconducting @xmath17 differs by nearly an order of magnitude , suggests that an additional energy scale must be important .",
