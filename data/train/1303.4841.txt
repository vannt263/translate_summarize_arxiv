    "up to date , quantum entanglement has played a very important role in quantum information processing ( qip ) such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , dense coding @xcite and quantum key distribution @xcite . beside the entangled orthogonal states ( e.g. , biphoton bell states ) , the entangled nonorthogonal states ( e.g. , ecss @xcite ) also attract a lot of attention in various applications in qip @xcite .    first , we make a brief review of the theory of `` entanglement of formation '' @xcite . for each pure",

    "we analyse decoherence properties of entangled coherent states ( ecss ) due to channel losses . in the discussion ,",

    "a coherent state @xmath14 , defined as an eigenstate of the annihilation operator @xmath15 , can be represented in the photon number states : @xmath16 where @xmath13 is a complex amplitude and the overlap is @xmath17 . in this paper",

    "employing the noisy channel model described in section 2 , the effect of the decoherence can be expressed as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 refers to the environment mode and @xmath20 is the noise parameter which means the fraction of photons that * survive * the noise . in the later discussion ,",
