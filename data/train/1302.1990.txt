    "the search for any unambiguous signal of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy - ion collisions is motivated by properly investigating the behaviour and properties of hot and dense hg @xcite . here",
    "we formulate a new thermodynamically consistent excluded - volume model where we assign a finite hard - core volume to each baryon but mesons in the theory can easily overlap , fuse and interpenetrate into each other .",
    "earlier , we have used this model successfully in obtaining the conjectured qcd phase boundary and thus determining precisely the location of qcd critical end point @xcite .",
    "we calculate various thermodynamical quantities like number density etc . of hg and compare our model results with that of urasima event generator @xcite .",
    "we use our freeze - out picture @xcite for calculating various hadron ratios and compare our results with the experimental data and various excluded - volume models . in order to make the discussion complete",
    ", we further derive @xmath0 etc . from our model and compare them with other models .",
    "further , we extend our model to deduce the rapidity as well as transverse mass spectra of hadrons and compare them with the experimental data available in order to illustrate the role of flow present in the fluid .",
    "finally , we give summary of this work .",
    "recently , we have proposed a thermodynamically consistent excluded - volume model for a hot , dense hg @xcite . the attractive interaction between baryons and mesons is realized by including the baryon and meson resonances in our model calculation .",
    "the repulsive interaction between baryons is modelled via giving an equal and finite size to each baryon .",
    "mesons can fuse and interpenetrate into each other so , they are treated as pointlike particles . using quantum statistics ,",
    "the grand canonical partition function for baryons can be written as follows :    @xmath1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 is the degeneracy factor of ith species of baryons,@xmath3 is the energy of the particle ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 is the eigen volume assigned to each baryon of ith species .",
    "apparently , our approach is more simple in comparison to other thermodynamically consistent excluded - volume approach @xcite which often involve transcendental expressions and are difficult to solve .",
    "we determine chemical freeze - out temperature and chemical potential by fitting our results with some experimental data and then use them in determining all other quantities and ratios .",
    "the rapidity distributions of baryons using thermal source can be written as follows @xcite :    @xmath6 exp\\left(\\frac{-m_i\\;coshy}{t}\\right)\\big[m_i^2t+\\frac{2m_it^2}{coshy}+\\frac{2t^3}{cosh^2y}\\big].\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the mass of the ith species .",
    "@xmath8 is the freeze - out volume of the system .",
    "the rapidity spectra of hadrons with the effect of flow can be calculated by using following formula @xcite :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is a free parameter related with the longitudinal flow velocity ( @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "our excluded - volume approach involves hard - core repulsion arising between two baryons but mesons do not possess any such repulsion .",
    "we have taken an equal volume @xmath12 for each baryon with a hard - core radius @xmath13 .",
    "we have also taken all baryons , mesons and their resonances having masses upto @xmath14 in our calculation of hg pressure .",
    "we have also imposed the condition of strangeness neutrality by considering @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the strangeness of ith hadron .",

    ", we have plotted the variation of number density of hadrons with respect to temperature at fixed net baryon density .",
    "our model results show a very good agreement with the results of sasaki @xcite except at higher @xmath17 .",
    "figure 2 represents the variation of @xmath18 ratio with @xmath19 .",
    "we find that our model calculation gives much better fit to the experimental data at all energies in comparison to cleymans - suhonen model @xcite .",
    "figure 3 depicts the variation of @xmath0 with respect to temperature as obtained in our model for hg @xcite having a baryonic hard - core size @xmath20 fm , and compared the results with those of gorenstein @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we find that near the expected qcd phase transition temperature ( @xmath22 mev ) , @xmath0 shows a lower value in our hg model than the value in other model . in fig .",

    "dotted line shows the distribution of @xmath23 due to stationary thermal source .",
    "solid line shows the rapidity distributions of @xmath23 after the incorporation of longitudinal flow in our thermal model and results give a good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .     with temperature for @xmath26 in our model and a comparison with the results obtained by gorenstein @xmath21 @xcite .",

    "in summary , we find that our model results mostly show very close agreement with those of sasaki , although the two approaches are completely different in nature .",
    "our model calculations for the particle ratios describe the experimental data very well .",
    "transport quantities are also successfully described by our model . the rapidity distributions which essentially are dependent on thermal parameters , also show a systematic behaviour and their interpretations most clearly involve the presence of a collective flow involved in the final description of the fireball .",
