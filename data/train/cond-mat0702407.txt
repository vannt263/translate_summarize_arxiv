    "this paper applies the string method@xcite to the phenomenon of hydrophobic collapse .",
    "it is shown that the method can describe complex dynamics in large atomistic systems , ones for which other currently available rare event methods would seem intractable .",
    "furthermore , the string method is used to demonstrate that atomistic dynamics can be usefully projected onto that of a coarse - grained field .",
    "the specific application of the string method considered herein finds results that are consistent with the mechanism of hydrophobic collapse put forward by ten wolde and chandler.@xcite    the hydrophobic effect - or the tendency of oil and water to separate on mesoscopic lengthscales - has long been recognized as an important driving force in molecular assembly.@xcite it stabilizes the formation of micelles , protein tertiary structure , multi - protein assemblies , and cellular membranes.@xcite recent theoretical developments have helped establish a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamics of hydrophobicity,@xcite but the dynamics of hydrophobic collapse remain poorly understood because it couples a large range of length- and timescales .",
    "relevant processes include the atomic - scale motions of individual water molecules , collective solvent density fluctuations , and the nanometer - scale movements of the hydrophobic solutes .",
    "bridging these dynamical hierarchies - and addressing the problem of complex dynamics in large systems - is a fundamental challenge for computational methods .",
    "we address this challenge using the string method in collective variables.@xcite we consider the collapse of a chain composed of twelve spherical hydrophobes in an explicit solvent of approximately 34,000 water molecules .",
    "the system is studied by coarse - graining the water molecule positions onto a set of 129,000 collective variables that represent the solvent density field and then using the string method in these variables to compute the minimum free energy path ( mfep ) for the hydrophobic collapse of the chain .",
    "conventional molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations are subsequently performed to confirm that this coarse - grained description adequately describes the mechanism of hydrophobic collapse .",
    "ten wolde and chandler@xcite have previously reported simulations of a non - atomistic model for the hydrated chain considered herein .",
    "it was found that the key step in the collapse dynamics is a collective solvent density fluctuation that is nucleated at the hydrophobic surface of the chain .",
    "however , it was not clear whether this proposed mechanism captured the essential features of hydrophobic collapse or whether it was an artifact of the model .",
    "atomistic simulations were needed to resolve the issue .",
    "previous efforts to characterize the mechanism of hydrophobic collapse using atomistic computer simulations neither confirm nor disprove the mechanism proposed by ten wolde and chandler . in recent work , for example , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations showed that dewetting accompanies the collapse of hydrophobes in water.@xcite however , the rate - limiting step - and thus the mechanism for hydrophobic collapse - was not characterized .",
    "specifically , in ref . , md trajectories were initiated at various separation distances for a pair of melettin protein dimers .",
    "observation of the collapse dynamics was observed only when the initial configuration was on the `` near '' side of the free energy barrier , but the actual nature of that barrier - and the dynamics of crossing it - were not studied . in ref .",
    ", the thermodynamics and solvation of a hydrophobic chain was studied as a function of its radius of gyration , but again , the dynamics of collapse was not characterized .",
    "the results presented here are the first atomistic simulations to explicitly confirm the mechanism of hydrophobic collapse put forward by ten wolde and chandler.@xcite in particular , we show that the rate - limiting step in hydrophobic collapse coincides with a collective solvent motion and that performing the rate - limiting step involves performing work almost exclusively in the solvent coordinates .",
    "we further show that the solvation free energy along the mfep can be decomposed into small- and large - lengthscale contributions .",
    "this analysis demonstrates that atomistic solvent energetics can be quantitatively modeled using a grid - based solvent density field , and it suggests that the rate - limiting step for hydrophobic collapse coincides with lengthscale - dependent hydrophobic dewetting .",
    "combined , the results presented in this study provide ( 1 ) evidence that the string method is a powerful tool for atomistically simulating complex dynamics in large systems , ( 2 ) a proof of principle that atomistic solvent dynamics can be usefully projected onto that of a coarse - grained field , and ( 3 ) an atomistic demonstration that dewetting is key to the dynamics of hydrophobic collapse .",
    "we consider the atomistic version of the hydrated hydrophobic chain studied by ten wolde and chandler.@xcite the chain is composed of twelve spherical hydrophobes , each of diameter @xmath0   and mass @xmath1 amu .",
    "these are ideal hydrophobes , as they exert purely repulsive interactions upon the oxygen atoms of the water molecules .",
    "consecutive hydrophobes in the unbranched chain interact via harmonic bonds , and the chain is made semi - rigid by a potential energy term that penalizes its curvature .",
    "the chain is hydrated with approximately @xmath2 rigid water molecules in an orthorhombic simulation box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "all simulations were performed at @xmath3  k. full details of the system are provided in the supporting information sec .",
    "a.    in describing hydrophobic collapse , it is necessary to choose an appropriate thermodynamic ensemble for the simulations .",
    "nanometer - scale fluctuations in solvent density are suspected to play a key role in these dynamics .",
    "use of the nvt ensemble ( with a 1  g/@xmath4 density of water ) might suppress these density fluctuations and bias the calculated mechanism .",
    "we avoid this problem with a simple technique that is based on the fact that under ambient conditions , liquid water is very close to phase coexistence .",
    "indeed , it is this proximity that leads to the possibility of large lengthscale hydrophobicity.@xcite by placing a fixed number of water molecules at @xmath3 k in a volume that corresponds to an average density of less than 1  g/@xmath4 , we obtain a fraction of the system at the density of water vapor and the majority at a density of bulk water .",
    "since we are not concerned with solvent fluctuations on macroscopic lengthscales , the difference between simulating bulk water at its own vapor pressure compared to atmospheric pressure is completely negligible .",
    "this strategy has been previously employed to study the dewetting transition between solvophobic surfaces.@xcite to ensure that the liquid - vapor interface remains both flat and well - distanced from the location of the chain , we repel particles from a thin layer at the top edge of the simulation box , as is discussed in supporting information sec .",
    "a.      throughout this study , we simulate the hydrated chain using atomistic md , but we employ the string method using collective variables that describe the solvent density field .",
    "a coarse - graining algorithm is developed to connect these atomistic and collective variable representations of the solvent .",

    "the constant - value contours of the committor function are approximated by a collection of hyperplanes that are perpendicular to a given path ( the string ) .",
    "this approximation can be justified within the framework of transition path theory ( tpt ) ,  @xcite which yields a variational criterion for the string such that the perpendicular hyperplanes optimally approximate the isocommittor surfaces .",
    "the string method in collective variables characterizes the committor function projected onto the space of collective variables . provided that the collective variables adequately describe the reaction and that the reactive trajectories projected onto the space of collective variables remain confined to a relativelly narrow tube , the approximation is not only optimal but also accurate . in this case",
    ", it can be shown that the string coincides with the minimum free energy path ( mfep ) in the space of collective variables , which is also the path of maximum likelihood for the recation monitored in these variables .",

    "this first stage of the string calculation included nine steepest descent timesteps .    in a second stage of the string calculation ,",
