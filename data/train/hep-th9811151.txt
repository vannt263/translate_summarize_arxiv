    "since its very origins , the exact renormalization group ( erg ) @xcite has proved to be a powerful tool for studies of non - perturbative effects in quantum field theory ( see recent reviews in @xcite ) .",
    "a particularly interesting case is that of an effective scalar field theory in two dimensions .",
    "as it was first conjectured by zamolodchikov @xcite , for a @xmath0 symmetric theory there should exist an infinite set of non - perturbative fixed points corresponding to the unitary minimal series of @xmath3 conformal field theories , where @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "morris @xcite showed numerically that such points do exist .",
    "the calculation was performed with a reparametrization invariant version of the legendre erg equation @xcite expanded in powers of derivatives .",
    "it was also pointed out there that to the level of the local potential approximation only the continuum limits described by periodic solutions and corresponding to critical sine - gordon models could be obtained . to find the expected set of fixed points the calculations had to be taken to the next order in the derivative expansion .",
    "this constituted a manifestation of the non - perturbative nature of the phenomena , and remarkably the legendre erg equation was powerful enough to locate and describe with good accuracy the expected set of 2d field theories .",
    "in this work we study the same @xmath0 symmetric scalar field theories in two dimensions but now with the polchinski erg equation @xcite .",
    "we present preliminary results which complement the results obtained with the legendre erg equation . in sect .",
    "2 we follow the article by ball et al . @xcite to present the basic equations of the formalism",

    "@xmath5 is a general wilsonian action which can be written in terms of dimensionless variables as follows [ ; t ] & = & _ p _ p p^2 ( k(^2 ) ) ^-1 _ -p + _ int[;t ] , [ action1 ] + _ int[;t ] & = & dy . [ action2 ] in eq .",
    "( [ cv1 ] ) the partial derivative on @xmath5 means it only acts on the explicit @xmath6 dependence of the couplings and the prime in the momentum derivative means it does not act on the delta function of the energy - momentum conservation , and @xmath7 .",

    "( [ action2 ] ) . within this approximation",
    "the polchinski erg equation reduces to the following system @xcite & = & f+2az-2ff+^+f+^-xf , [ eq1 ] + & = & z+bf^2 - 4zf-2zf+^-xz- z-/2 , [ eq2 ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the potentials @xmath16 and @xmath17 are defined in eq .",

    "[ eqfp2 ] we will choose the initial conditions ( according to the terminology adopted in the literature on the erg equations ) set by the @xmath0 symmetry : @xmath33 and @xmath34 and by the normalization condition : @xmath35 . for the value of the first derivative of @xmath31 at the origin we will take the condition @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a free parameter .",

    "( [ eqfp1 ] ) , ( [ eqfp2 ] ) for @xmath39 we consider the recursive numerical method already tested for @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the physical fixed point solutions @xmath41 , @xmath42 at the fixed point value @xmath43 are regular for @xmath44 and have a certain asymptotic behavior as @xmath45 . thus the natural method for finding the correct numerical solution is to select those which can be integrated as far as possible in @xmath19 .",
    "a generic solution will end at a sharp singularity for a finite value of @xmath19 .",
    "the difficulty lies in the nonlinear and stiff nature of the equations and the need to fine tune @xmath1 and @xmath37 .",
    "this makes the direct integration of the system too hard .",
    "one way out is to solve it recursively .",
    "unlike the case @xmath40 studied in a number of articles @xcite , one faces an additional difficulty in two dimensions .",
    "it is not possible to start the iterative procedure by setting in eq .",
    "( [ eqfp1 ] ) @xmath46 and @xmath47 as it is prescribed by the consistency of the leading approximation . for @xmath39 the polchinski equation in the leading order",
    "has only periodic or singular solutions for all values of @xmath37 . to overcome this difficulty one has to consider @xmath48 as the initial value to start the iterations",
    "consequently , an analysis of the leading order polchinski equation @xmath49 with the initial conditions @xmath33 , @xmath36 for non - zero @xmath1 is required .",
    "we studied eq .",
    "( [ eqfp01 ] ) for @xmath39 numerically for a wide range of values of @xmath1 and @xmath37 .",
    "our results show that for each @xmath50 we can fine tune @xmath37 in such a way as to obtain a non - trivial regular fixed point solution .",
    "the set of such values @xmath51 form a discrete series of continuous lines @xmath52 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in fact",
    "simple arguments can be presented which explain the appearance of the lines in the parameter space corresponding to regular fixed - point solutions @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath53 denote position of the pole of a generic solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqfp01 ] ) .",
    "suppose that for some values @xmath54 the solution is regular , i.e. @xmath55 .",
    "let us take another value @xmath56 sufficiently close to @xmath57 .",
    "assuming that the function @xmath53 is continuous , it is clear that there should exist the value @xmath58 such that again @xmath59 .",
    "hence there is a line of the `` constant value '' @xmath60 in the parameter space .",
    "when we move along a fixed line the solutions @xmath41 do not change their shape significantly . moreover",
    ", their shape follows a regular pattern when passing from one curve to the other similar to solutions obtained by morris @xcite .",
    "this can be considered as a sign for the existence of the infinite discrete set of fixed points corresponding to the minimal unitary series of conformal models .",
    "we also would like to note that for @xmath61 and @xmath62 there are no other non - trivial fixed - point solutions besides the ones corresponding to the lines discussed here .",
    "= 1.0    we would like to note that a similar picture takes place in other dimensions .",
    "for @xmath40 we found the same discrete set of lines in the @xmath63-plane corresponding to regular solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eqfp01 ] ) , but in this case they are situated in the interval @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . as one can see",
    "there is a line ( upper line in fig .",
    "1 ) which crosses the @xmath37-axis at @xmath65 . this is the value of the parameter @xmath37 for which a non - trivial fixed point solution of the polchinski equation was found in the leading order ( local potential approximation ) @xcite .",
    "the important observation is that there is only one line in the @xmath63-plane with positive values of @xmath1 .",
    "since according to general arguments at physical fixed points @xmath66 , this suggests that for @xmath40 there is only one non - trivial fixed point .",
    "this is the wilson - fischer fixed point found in numerous previous studies @xcite .",
    "recall that for @xmath39 all the lines are situated in the @xmath67 half - plane , hence one can expect an infinite number of non - trivial fixed points .",
    "one more remark is relevant here . by a simple scaling analysis of eq .",
    "( [ eqfp01 ] ) it can be shown that there is a certain mapping between the lines @xmath52 in different dimensions .",
    "when we pass from one dimension to another the line experiences a vertical shift and scaling transformation .",
    "more details about this mapping will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we now pass to the study of the system ( [ eqfp1 ] ) , ( [ eqfp2 ] ) .",
    "we have seen that there are families of solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eqfp01 ] ) corresponding to a given fixed point .",
    "it turns out that when the second equation of the system is taken into account , this degeneracy disappears .",
    "we solved the system using the following iteration procedure developed by ball et al .",
    "first we set @xmath68 , choose some initial value @xmath69 and fine tune @xmath37 to the value @xmath70 corresponding to the regular solution @xmath71 of the first equation ( [ eqfp1 ] ) ( or ( [ eqfp01 ] ) ) .",
    "of course , the point @xmath72 lies on one of the lines described above ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ) . as the next step",
    "we insert the function @xmath71 into the second equation ( [ eqfp2 ] ) for a fixed @xmath21 and fine tune @xmath1 to the value @xmath73 for which a regular solution @xmath74 exists .",
    "then we substitute @xmath74 and @xmath75 into the first equation of the system and find a regular solution for a fixed value of @xmath20 thus obtaining a new value @xmath76 and a new function @xmath77 .",
    "we repeat this process keeping @xmath20 and @xmath21 fixed . as a result a sequence of functions @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and a sequence of numbers @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , are obtained , and we test them for convergence .    for @xmath40 and for the relevant line , associated with the wilson - fischer fixed point , we confirmed the results by ball et al . @xcite .",
    "the new feature in our calculations is that we took @xmath86 as the initial value of the iterating procedure , whereas in @xcite only @xmath87 was considered .",
    "we conclude that the numerical method converges and that the rate of convergence is controlled by @xmath20 for fixed @xmath88 .",
    "the best @xmath20 was shown to correspond to the inflexion point where @xmath89 changes sign .",
    "the important observation is that the final values @xmath38 and @xmath90 to which the iterations converge ( i.e. the fixed - point values ) do not depend on the initial value @xmath91 .",
    "when @xmath88 is closer to the fixed - point value the rate of convergence is of course faster . the final value @xmath38 depends on @xmath21 linearly . for @xmath92",
    "the two equations decouple and there is no need for iterations to find a solution of the system .",
    "we just have to adjust @xmath21 such that @xmath93 . for the wilson - fischer fixed point @xmath94 we found @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "= 1.0    for @xmath39 the situation is totally different . for any line @xmath97",
    "we start with and the initial value @xmath98 the iterative procedure turns out to be divergent if @xmath99 .",
    "only for @xmath92 we have been able to find a solution to the now decoupled system ( [ eqfp1 ] ) , ( [ eqfp2 ] ) by adjusting @xmath21 .",
    "similar to the case @xmath40 we have not found any natural criteria to select the value of @xmath21 since for each line @xmath21 depends monotonically on @xmath1 decreasing as @xmath100 . to determine the fixed - point solutions , corresponding to the minimal unitary series of conformal field theories",
    ", we have fixed the value of @xmath21 by a fit to the series of exact values for the anomalous scaling dimension @xmath38 . in this way we found @xmath101 .",
    "the fixed - point solutions for @xmath41 display regular behaviour and are reminiscent of those obtained by morris @xcite .",
    "in particular they have @xmath102 extrema , @xmath103 ( see fig .",
    "the fixed point solutions for @xmath42 have the same pattern of extrema , though their profiles are different from those of morris .",
    "next for @xmath104 and and corresponding values @xmath43 we have calculated the critical exponent @xmath2 . for this we considered perturbations of the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 around the fixed - point solutions , @xmath105 and substituted them into eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "after linearization we obtained the system  -2g_nf_*-2f_*g_n+_*^+g_n+ _ * ^-xg_n&= & _ ng_n , + h_n-2f_*h_n-2g_nz_*-4f_*h_n-4g_nz _ * & & + + _ * ^-xh_n-_*h_n+ 2bf_*g_n&=&_nh_n , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are calculated for @xmath43 .    for @xmath0 perturbations the initial conditions are @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "we also imposed the normalization condition @xmath110 .",
    "away from the fixed point ( but sufficiently close to it ) we relaxed @xmath111 to be different from zero , @xmath112 .",
    "then @xmath113 and @xmath114 were fine tuned so that polynomially growing eigenfunctions were obtained . for @xmath39 , @xmath92 and @xmath104",
    "we have calculated the critical exponent @xmath115 .",
    "the results for @xmath38 and @xmath2 are given in table 1 .",
    "we conclude that the polchinski erg equation gives the values for the critical exponent which match quite well the exact conformal field theory values @xcite and the results by morris @xcite , also included in the table .",
    "we note that the best fit value for @xmath21 that we have found actually corresponds to a well defined subset of the regulating functions .",
    "an explicit example is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 to ensure @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and @xmath120 to give @xmath104 .",
    "values obtained by morris @xcite ( @xmath57 , @xmath121 ) and the exact results of    conformal field theory ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) .",
    "in this work we have studied the solutions of the polchinski erg equation for an effective @xmath0-symmetric scalar field theory in the two - dimensional space @xmath124 .",
    "we have seen that this equation provides a reliable non - perturbative evidence for the existence of the fixed - point solutions corresponding to the minimal unitary series of conformal field theories and allows to calculate the anomalous dimension and the critical exponents with good accuracy .",
    "this constitutes another positive test of the power of the erg approach . at the same time our studies are complementary to similar calculations within the erg approach based on the equation for the legendre action @xcite .    as mentioned above , in the leading order of the derivative expansion ( local potential approximation ) the consistent value for @xmath1 is 0 and only periodic sine - gordon type fixed - point solutions",
    "can be obtained .",
    "however , we have found that there are continuous families of fixed - point solutions corresponding to a series of lines @xmath52 in the @xmath63 plane which have a part with positive values @xmath125 .",
    "it was also argued that these lines correspond to the multicritical fixed points of the theory .",
    "it is by taking into account the second order in the derivative expansion that we find isolated fixed - point solutions .",
    "we have found the first 10 points out of the infinite series and calculated the critical exponent @xmath2 for them .",
    "the results depend on the choice of the regulating function . the value of @xmath21 , for which a regular solution exists , depends linearly on @xmath1 , so the criterium of minimal sensitivity can not be applied to fix @xmath21 .",
    "the best fit to the conformal field theory values of @xmath1 gives us @xmath92 , @xmath101 .",
    "no other regulating functions have been found to work .",
    "for @xmath39 whenever @xmath126 , the iterative procedure is not seen to converge .",
    "in fact , for @xmath92 there is no need for iterations since the two equations of the polchinski approach decouple .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case of @xmath40 where convergence was checked for @xmath126 @xcite . for the values @xmath92 , @xmath104 , giving the best fit , our results are comparable in accuracy and sometimes better ( the accuracy also increases with multicriticality ) than those of morris @xcite .",
    "we would like to note that fixing @xmath21 by the best fit to exact results for the anomalous dimensions @xmath1 is reminiscent of fixing the renormalization scheme dependence in the perturbative renormalization group .",
    "it is also similar to fixing the regulator by the condition of the reparametrization invariance for the erg equation for the legendre action ( that corresponds to the limiting case of @xmath92 , @xmath127 ) @xcite .",
    "another important point we would like to mention is that in our analysis we have not found non - trivial fixed points other than those corresponding to the minimal models .",
    "this is what one expects from zamolodchikov s @xmath128-theorem  @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is already clear from the analysis of the leading order polchinski equation for @xmath48 when the lines in the @xmath129-plane corresponding to non - trivial fixed points are plotted .    as final comments we would like to mention that to obtain an estimate of the error of our numerical results in table 1 one needs to carry out the calculations to the next order of the derivative expansion",
    ". it would be also interesting to expand the analysis for higher dimension operators .",
