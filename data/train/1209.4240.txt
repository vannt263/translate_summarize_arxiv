    "since the classic works by kalecki @xcite and frisch & holme @xcite on the emergence of macro - economical patterns ( business and economics cycles ) , it has been well - established that time delays occurring on microscopic scales can have profound effects on the global response of complex systems . among other early key results",

    "the importance of time delay becomes even more explicit in interacting individual- or agent - based models @xcite , where the delays can correspond to time scales in the interactions ( e.g. transmission delays ) or to time scales of the local decision and execution by the individuals . in this paper",
    ", we consider the simplest  yet fundamental ",
    "model for such networked systems , taking into consideration the effects of the network topology and couplings , noise , and time delays @xcite .",
    "this paper provides an extended account of our recent letter @xcite , providing more details , generalizations and comparisons to certain weighted networks , and considering different types of delays .    in network synchronization @xcite , coordination , or consensus problems @xcite , individuals or entities represented by nodes in the network attempt to adjust their local state variables ( e.g. , pace , load , phase , or orientation ) in a decentralized fashion .",
    "( in this paper , we use the terms synchronization , coordination , and consensus synonymously in this broader sense . )",
    "nodes interact or communicate only with their local neighbors in the network , often with the intention to improve global performance .",
    "these couplings can be represented by directed or undirected , weighted or unweighted links .",
    "applications of the corresponding models range from physics , biology , computer science to control theory , including synchronization problems in distributed computing @xcite , symbolic dynamics @xcite , congestion control in communication networks @xcite and in vehicular traffic @xcite , flocking animals @xcite , bursting neurons @xcite , and cooperative control of vehicle formation @xcite .",
    "synchronization , coordination , or consensus in complex networks cuts across numerous fields that address global behavior through decentralized local actions facilitated by sparse interactions .",
    "there has already been much investigation into the efficiency and optimization of synchronization @xcite in weighted @xcite and directed @xcite topologies .",
    "because of limitations in communication , transportation , processing , or cognitive resources , the local information on the state of the network neighborhood may not always be current , nor is it even given for the same instant at a past time for all components .",
    "these time delays can have drastic effects on system behavior @xcite and further complicate predictability of the network s global performance .",
    "the impact of time delays on stochastic differential equations involving a single stochastic variable , with recent applications to postural sway @xcite , stick balancing at a fingertip @xcite , and the scaling of congestion window in internet protocols @xcite , have been investigated in the past two decades @xcite . here , we focus on the interplay of network topology , couplings , noise , and time delays .",
    "our motivation is to understand how network - connected individuals contribute to global goals by performing delayed actions and/or using delayed information facilitated by local interactions in a noisy environment .",
    "the phenomena of spontaneous synchronization , coordination , or consensus arise in a variety of disciplines @xcite .",
    "for example , it describes the consensus that arises in bird flocks as each bird makes velocity adjustments to match the group , which is crucial in accomplishing such tasks as avoiding predators @xcite .",
    "similarly , it can be applied to a collection of autonomous vehicles working cooperatively to carry out a task @xcite .",
    "risk can be managed without central governance in uncertain environments through the synchronicity or spontaneous cooperation of individuals .",
    "this appears in economics when considering stock trades @xcite ; in ecology there is the reward of reproduction and the danger of predation for chirping cicadas and flashing fireflies @xcite .",
    "while there are adversarial relationships between individual participants , there are still mutual benefits ( predictive insight or bodily protection ) from the collective behavior . massively parallel and distributed",
    "computing schemes require synchronization across processors @xcite in order to avoid diverging progressions of simulation time but must be balanced with the cost of communication .",
    "synchronization of coupled phase oscillators @xcite ( the kuramoto model @xcite ) has many applications , recently to spatial patterns in flashing microfluidic arrays @xcite and to circuits comprised of optomechanical arrays @xcite . in neural networks ,",
    "time delays critically affect the synchronization of excitatory fronts @xcite .",
    "all these examples are instances of a group coming to consensus @xcite without an omniscient global operator .",
    "they fundamentally rely on the communication between individuals , which may be ( and often is ) sent through noisy channels @xcite .      in the model we consider here ,",
    "the state of each node @xmath0 is described by a local scalar state variable @xmath1 . in stochastic network coordination / consensus problems ,",
    "nodes locally adjust their state in an attempt to match that of their neighbors through linear couplings in the presence of noise .",
