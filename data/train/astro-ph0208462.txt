    "all extrasolar planets orbiting main - sequence stars known to date are giant planets ranging in mass from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 the unknown angle between the orbital plane and the sky ) .",
    "it is virtually impossible to detect terrestrial planets ( rocky objects of 1 to a few @xmath0 ) around f , g and k - type stars using the high - precision @xmath1 technique , since earth - mass planets induce only negligible reflex - motions on their host stars .",
    "this scenario changes in the faint and low - mass regime of the hertzsprung - russell diagram . in the case of m - dwarf stars",
    "the low stellar primary mass leads to detectable @xmath1 amplitudes even for planets of a few @xmath0 and less in short - period orbits .",
    "fig.1 shows the @xmath1 signatures of planets with @xmath8 to @xmath9 orbiting an m5v star with a mass of @xmath10 .",
    "due to its intrinsic faintness the habitable zone is located very close to the star ( kasting , whitmire , & reynolds 1993 ) .",
    "this , too , favors the detection by the @xmath1 technique , since shorter periods also mean higher @xmath1 amplitudes . although these nearby planets are probably tidally locked into synchronous rotation , a 3-d climate study by joshi , haberle , & reynolds ( 1997 ) demonstrated that these planets are still likely to be habitable",
    "for the past two years we have used the eso vlt and the uves spectrograph to monitor a sample of m - dwarf stars in the southern hemisphere to search for planetary companions .",
    "our @xmath1 results for proxima cen ( m5v , @xmath11 ) , obtained with an enhanced version of our _ austral _ radial velocity code ( endl , krster , & els 2000 ) , are displayed in fig.2 . over the time span of more than one year",
    "the star experiences a linear acceleration of unknown origin .",
    "the rms - scatter around this trend is @xmath2 .",
    "we then take the 22 rv - measurements ( after subtraction of the linear trend ) and determine our planet detection threshold in the period range for orbits inside the habitable zone ( 2 to 16 days ) , using the technique from endl at al .",
    "for the primary mass we adopt a value of @xmath12 after henry et al .",
    "fig.3 shows our momentary detection capability based on the @xmath1 data collected so far . with a confidence of",
    "@xmath13 we could have already detected _ all _ planets with @xmath14 values higher than @xmath15 to @xmath4 inside the habitable zone . with a chance probability of @xmath16 ( i.e.",
    "only half of the test signals were recovered successfully with a confidence of @xmath13 ) we would have even found signals of planets down to @xmath17 . these new constraints on planets inside the habitable zone of proxima cen supplement the existing limits for giant planets around this star by our eso ces planet search program ( krster et al .",
    "1999 ) and the hst fine guidance sensor astrometric results of benedict et al .",
    "measuring radial velocities of m - dwarfs with the appropriate high level of precision allows us to detect extremely low - mass planets in short period orbits . with the 22 @xmath1 measurments we obtained so far for proxima cen",
    ", we could have already detected _ all _ planets with @xmath3 to @xmath4 inside the habitable zone .",
    "so the answer to the title question is : _ not yet _ , but we get pretty close , and our sensitivity will further improve by extending the monitoring time span .",
    "this work is supported by nasa grant nag5 - 9227 and by nsf grant ast-9808980 .",
    "we thank the eso opc and ddtc for generous allocation of observing time to our vlt m - dwarf planet search program ( proposals 69.c-0722 , 68.c-0415 , 67.c-5700 ) .",
