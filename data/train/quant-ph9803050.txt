    "the development of nonperturbative methods for quantum field theories remains as much a challenge as a necessity .",
    "the many areas of physics where field - theoretic approaches have proved useful are full of examples of phenomena whose description lies outside the scope of perturbation theory . in most cases ,",
    "a reliable treatment of the nonperturbative dynamics is still lacking .    with the exception of a limited number of exactly solvable models ,",
    "most systems requiring nonperturbative methods have been the object of approximate treatments .",
    "this is an unavoidable consequence of the complexity of the dynamics involved .",
    "nevertheless , it should not prevent us from having a clearer understanding of the physics , as long as we have some control over the approximations made .",
    "the approximate methods most commonly used could , perhaps , be classified into three major groups : expansions around special limits , variational methods and numerical techniques .",
    "semiclassical and @xmath0 expansions , gaussian and hartree - fock methods , and monte carlo techniques in lattice calculations exemplify each respective group . in all of them",
    ", serious technical difficulties stand in the way of establishing reliable controls and , in some cases , of even fully implementing the approximation scheme .",
    "semiclassical expansions certainly pose hard problems for both their implementation and control . in this article",
    ", we discuss a physical situation where such problems can be overcome : one - dimensional quantum statistical mechanics or , from a field - theoretic point of view , scalar finite temperature field theory in zero spatial dimension .",
    "the drastic reduction in dimensionality is the price we have to pay to accomplish our goal : a thorough semiclassical treatment whose results can be compared to those of perturbation theory , as well as to exact ones , when available .",
    "one should not forget , however , that numerous applications in physics can be studied within this framework , and that , as we shall indicate in the sequel , symmetries may reduce higher dimensional problems to situations where our results may still be used .",
    "the article will start with a discussion of the quadratic semiclassical approximation ( section ii ) , comprising an analysis of the extrema of the classical action and of the fluctuation determinants around them .",
    "a connection to catastrophe theory allows for the identification of the minima amidst the complexity of the set of classical solutions .",
    "the next step ( section iii ) is the derivation , using techniques described in @xcite , of the semiclassical propagator in the background of any one of the extrema , a crucial result which leads to the expression for the fluctuation determinant and serves as the basis for a semiclassical expansion ( section iv ) .",
    "the expansion provides , already in first order , nonperturbative estimates for correlation functions .",
    "ground states of quartic anharmonic oscillators can be computed to that order : the result contains a sum over an infinite number of diagrams in perturbation theory , an indication of the power of the technique .",
    "finally ( section v ) , we summarize our conclusions and comment on possible applications of these results in higher dimensions .",
    "the partition function for a one - dimensional quantum - mechanical system in an arbitrary potential , @xmath1 , can be written as a path - integral@xcite : @xmath2\\ ,   { \\rm e}^{-s/\\hbar}\\ , , \\label{z } \\\\    s&=&\\int_{0}^{\\beta\\hbar}d\\tau\\ ,   \\left[\\frac{1}{2}m\\dot x^2+v(x)\\right]\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as mentioned before , this can be viewed as the partition function for a scalar finite temperature field theory , in the limiting case where the number of space dimensions is zero .",
    "we may expand the euclidean action around its minima , i.e. , the stable classical trajectories , , which is the equation of motion for a particle moving in the potential _ minus _ @xmath3 . ] and keep terms only up to quadratic .",
    "the functional integral over the paths can , then , be performed to yield a quadratic semiclassical evaluation of ( [ z ] ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the action and @xmath6 represents the determinant of the fluctuation operator , @xmath7\\,,\\ ] ] both calculated at the @xmath8-th classical trajectory , @xmath9 , satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath10 ; @xmath11 is the number of classical trajectories which are minima of the action functional .",
    "the action has a simple expression in terms of the turning points of the classical trajectory : @xmath12 here , @xmath13}$ ] and @xmath14 are turning points to the right ( left ) of @xmath15 .",
    "the first term in ( [ s ] ) corresponds to the high - temperature limit of @xmath16 , where the classical paths collapse to a point , i.e. , @xmath17 . for motion in regions where the inverted potential is unbounded ( hereafter called unbounded motion ) , @xmath18 . for periodic motion ,",
    "@xmath19 counts the number of periods and the second term is absent . for bounded aperiodic motion , all terms are present .",
    "the last two terms will be negligible for potentials which vary little over a thermal wavelength , @xmath20 .",
    "however , by decreasing the temperature , quantum effects become important .    for trajectories having a single turning point @xmath21 , @xmath22",

    "are naturally excluded from the calculation .",
    "the derivations of ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ delta2 ] ) will be outlined in section iii .",
    "formulae ( [ s ] ) , ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ delta2 ] ) do not require full knowledge of the classical trajectory , as the dependence on @xmath9 comes only through the turning point .",
    "furthermore , equations ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ delta2 ] ) yield a direct evaluation of the determinant which bypasses solving an eigenvalue problem for each stable classical trajectory . to see how this can simplify the evaluation of @xmath27 ,",
    "let us take the harmonic oscillator , @xmath28 , as an example . in this case , given @xmath15 and @xmath29 there is only one trajectory , with a single turning point , given by @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 can also be readily calculated , the final result being @xmath34 which in this case is exact .    for the single - well quartic anharmonic oscillator , @xmath35 , @xmath36",
    ", it is still true that there is only one trajectory , given @xmath15 and @xmath29 , which has a single turning point .",
    "( [ t ] ) yields : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is one of the jacobian elliptic functions@xcite .",
    "we may , then , use eqs .",
    "( [ s ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) , and change the integration variable in ( [ zsc ] ) from @xmath15 to @xmath39 to obtain @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting integral can be evaluated numerically .",
    "a more interesting situation occurs in the case of the double - well quartic anharmonic oscillator , @xmath40 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "only single paths with single turning points exist for fixed @xmath15 and @xmath29 . however , there is also a region , @xmath42 , where the classical motion is bounded and a much richer structure exists@xcite , one in which more than one classical path may exist for given values of @xmath15 and @xmath29 .    in a region",
    "of bounded classical motion ( a well in @xmath43 ) , such as @xmath42 for the anharmonic oscillator , the number of classical trajectories changes as the temperature drops . if @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a local minimum of @xmath43 ) , for every @xmath15 in this region there is only one closed path , with a single turning point , satisfying the classical equations of motion . for @xmath47",
    "this path goes to the left ( right ) and returns to @xmath15 .",
    "for @xmath48 , it sits still at the bottom of the well .",
    "it is this single - path regime which goes smoothly into the high - temperature limit .    for @xmath49",
    ", the solution that sits still at @xmath46 becomes unstable .",
    "its fluctuation operator is that of a harmonic oscillator with @xmath50 .",
    "its finite temperature determinant is @xmath51 .",
    "this goes through zero at @xmath49 and becomes negative for @xmath52 , thus signaling that @xmath53 becomes unstable . at the same time ,",
    "two new classical paths appear , symmetric with respect to @xmath46 , as depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath48 , we go from a single - path regime to a triple - path regime as we cross @xmath49 .",
    "the two new paths are degenerate minima , whereas the path that sits still at @xmath46 becomes a saddle - point of the action , with a single negative mode .",
    "as @xmath29 grows beyond @xmath54 , an analogous situation occurs for other values of @xmath15 inside the well . when the fluctuation determinant around the classical path for a given @xmath15 vanishes , a new classical path appears .",
    "its single turning point lies opposite , with respect to @xmath46 , to that of the formerly unique path .",
    "if @xmath29 is increased further , this trajectory splits into two , as illustrated in fig .  2 .",
    "one is a local minimum of the action , whereas the other is a saddle - point , with only one negative mode .",
    "again , we have transitioned from a single to a triple - path regime .",
    "as @xmath29 grows , the triple - path region spreads out around @xmath46 .",
    "the frontiers of that region are defined by the points @xmath15 such that @xmath55 , where the expression ( [ delta ] ) for the determinant vanishes .",
    "the phenomenon just described is an example of catastrophe .",
    "it takes place whenever the number of classical trajectories changes , with one or more of them becoming unstable , as we lower the temperature .",
    "conversely , we may say that the phenomenon is characterized by the coalescence of two or more of the classical trajectories , as we increase the temperature .",
    "this is akin to the ocurrence of caustics in optics@xcite , where light rays play the role of classical trajectories and the action is replaced with the optical distance . in the next subsection , we shall use the mathematics of catastrophes to understand how the set of classical trajectories changes with temperature .",
    "if we use the basis of eigenfunctions of the fluctuation operator around classical paths , and denote by @xmath56 the coordinate associated with the direction of instability of our example , the action can be viewed as @xmath57 , with the dots referring to all others .",
    "catastrophe theory@xcite allows us to write down the `` normal form '' , @xmath58 , of this generating function in the three - dimensional subspace made up by the unstable direction of state space ( the set of paths ) and the two control variables , @xmath29 and @xmath15 ; it is this subspace which is relevant for the study of the onset of instability .",
    "as catastrophes are classified by their codimension in control space , which here is two - dimensional , only those of codimension 1 ( the fold ) or 2 ( the cusp ) are generic ( i.e. , structurally stable ) .",
    "the pattern of extrema then leads to the cusp , whose generating function is @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the control parameters , are related to @xmath29 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "this catastrophe is defined by @xmath62 eliminating @xmath56 from these equations , we can draw the bifurcation set in control space ( the curve @xmath63 ) , as well as the pattern of extrema of @xmath58 ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "assuming that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are linearly related to @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , for small values of both , we can also schematically plot the classical action ( i.e. , the action for classical trajectories ) as a function of @xmath15 for different values of @xmath29 ; , where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 are control variables",
    ". the extremum condition is , then , @xmath69 .",
    "the identifications @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 will make the additional condition that defines the swallowtail , @xmath73 , coincide with the requirement @xmath74 .",
    "( in the jargon of catastrophe theory : the bifurcation set for the swallowtail coincides with the equilibrium hypersurface of the cusp . ) ] see fig .",
    "4(a , b ) .",
    "new classical trajectories , accompanied by new catastrophes , will occur as we keep increasing @xmath29 . from @xmath75 , we start having trajectories with @xmath76 , i.e. , with one full period . for these , the determinant of fluctuations vanishes because the first , not the second bracket of ( [ delta ] ) goes trough zero .",
    "however , the fluctuation operator around such trajectories already has a negative eigenmode .",
    "this follows from the fact that the zero - mode , given by @xmath77 , has a node .",
    "thus , it can not be the ground - state for the associated schrdinger problem .",
    "this means that a new catastrophe takes place along a second direction in function space .",
    "this new catastrophe is also a cusp . at @xmath46 ,",
    "as @xmath29 becomes larger than @xmath78 , the solution that sits still acquires a second negative eigenvalue  thus becoming unstable along a new direction in function space  and two other solutions appear . they both have a negative eigenvalue along the first direction of instability and a positive eigenvalue along the new direction of instability . if we combine the information from both directions , we find that we go from two minima and a saddle - point with only one negative eigenvalue ( hereafter , a one - saddle ) to two minima , two one - saddles and one two - saddle .",
    "the two one - saddles are degenerate in action and represent time - reversed periodic paths .",
    "as @xmath29 increases beyond @xmath78 , the same phenomenon takes place for @xmath15 around @xmath46 : the one - saddles that already existed for @xmath79 in the three - path region around @xmath46 become unstable along a second direction , and a five - path region grows around @xmath46 , with two minima , two ( periodic , degenerate in action ) one - saddles and a two - saddle .",
    "the new cusp can be cast into normal form using the second direction of instability : @xmath80 the absence of the linear term in eq .",
    "( [ sn2 ] ) [ compare with eq .",
    "( [ sn ] ) ] reflects the degeneracy in action of the two one - saddles .",
    "however , there is another degeneracy : since @xmath3 does not depend on @xmath29 , if @xmath81 is a solution of the euler - lagrange equation , so is @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath81 is periodic , @xmath82 describes the same path ( and so has the same action ) , but with another starting point .",
    "this can be represented in eq .",
    "( [ sn2 ] ) by the choice @xmath83 $ ] , with @xmath84 .",
    "see fig .",
    "4(c )    as we approach @xmath85 , the situation becomes similar to the one near @xmath49 .",
    "the difference is that we now have to deal with a path with more than one and less than two periods . near @xmath86 ,",
    "two - period paths intervene , a situation similar to that at @xmath75 . the pattern which develops@xcite is depicted in fig .  5 .    despite the fact that we keep adding new extrema as we lower the temperature , only two of these are stable ( i.e. , minima ) . in a semiclassical approximation in euclidean time ,",
    "appropriate to equilibrium situations , these are the only extrema we have to sum over , meaning that @xmath11 never exceeds two . for @xmath52",
    ", there will be regions with either one or two minima of the classical action .",
    "the transition from a single - minimum to a double - minimum region occurs at values of @xmath15 where the fluctuation determinant vanishes due to the appearance of a caustic , thus leading to a singularity in the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ zsc ] ) .",
    "this is not a disaster , however , as this singularity is integrable .",
    "( such a singularity is an artifact of the semiclassical approximation .",
    "it disappears in a more refined approximation@xcite , in which one includes higher order fluctuations in the direction(s ) of function space where the instability sets in . )",
    "we shall exhibit the details of this calculation in a forthcoming publication@xcite .    to conclude , two remarks : ( i ) our results may be used to derive a semiclassically improved perturbation expansion , which will be presented in section iv ; ( ii ) the semiclassical partition function incorporates , in an approximate way , quantum effects that become more and more relevant with the increase of the thermal wavelength . at very low temperatures , however , the quadratic approximations inherent to the semiclassical approximation fail to capture the details of the potential , which are important in the regime of large thermal wavelengths .",
    "thus , we expect our calculations to be a better approximation at high temperatures . indeed , studying the @xmath87 limit of @xmath27 for the anharmonic oscillator , one finds no corrections to the unperturbed ground state energy .",
    "nevertheless , this can be corrected by using the semiclassically improved perturbation theory just mentioned .",
    "in the next section we will show that , in order to go beyond the quadratic approximation of the preceding section , it is necessary to derive the semiclassical propagator , defined as : @xmath88\\,e^{-\\sigma_j/\\hbar}\\ ; ,   \\label{gj } \\\\ & & \\sigma_j\\equiv\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\tau_1}^{\\tau_2}d\\tau\\,\\left\\{m{\\left(\\frac { d\\eta } { d\\tau}\\right)}^2+v''[x_j(\\tau)]\\,\\eta^2\\right\\}\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath89 involves the fluctuation operator , @xmath90 , which corresponds to the second functional derivative of the action around the classical trajectory , @xmath9 .",

    "the arguments of section ii allow us to restrict our attention to single turning point paths , although we will sketch how one should proceed in the most general case , at the end of this section .",
    "it can be easily checked that @xmath124 satisfies equation ( [ gauss ] ) , by simply differentiating the euclidean classical equation of motion with respect to euclidean time . then : @xmath125 if we consider @xmath126 , one can check that @xmath127 also satisfies equation ( [ gauss ] ) , again thanks to the equation of motion satisfied by @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , it can be used as @xmath104 for @xmath126 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath128 and @xmath129 are well - defined@xcite .",

    "these two conditions determine the linear combination and guarantee continuity . as a result",

    "then , @xmath142 will be traded for @xmath143 .",

    "this has the effect of breaking up the path integral into pieces that go from zero to the various times corresponding to multiple insertions of @xmath155 and , finally , to @xmath142 .",
    "the result of doing the path integral in each piece yields the semiclassical propagator at different time intervals .",

    "as for the @xmath139 dependence , it is completely known , although the integrals involved may not be done analytically .",
    "the integrals over @xmath139 can , alternatively , be transformed into integrals over @xmath158 ( the classical position ) .",
    "we should note that the first term in ( [ particao4 ] ) is just the fluctuation determinant and that each individual term in the series corresponds to an infinite sum of diagrams in ordinary perturbation theory , plus additional terms which depend on the classical solution .    in order to illustrate the usefulness of the expansion ,",
    "let us outline some of its consequences in the case of the single - well quartic anharmonic oscillator , @xmath159 , already discussed in section ii . if we define a dimensionless coupling @xmath160 , the first order correction in the expansion , i.e. , the second term in the bracket of equation ( [ particao4 ] ) , may be written as @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is a dimensionless integral : @xmath163\\ ] ] the functions @xmath103 and @xmath104 can be expressed in terms of jacobian elliptic functions and elliptic integrals @xcite which we shall not write down .",
    "all we want to emphasize is that @xmath164 can be expanded in a power series in @xmath165 , just as @xmath144 . in ordinary perturbation theory ,",
    "the first order term is of order @xmath165 , and goes at most as @xmath29 , for large @xmath29 .",

    "one might introduce an external current , @xmath170 , coupled to the variable , @xmath171 , and use the knowledge of the semiclassical propagator to integrate the linear plus quadratic piece of the action to derive a functional of @xmath170 , to be used in the expansion in the standard way @xcite .",
    "the methods developed in the preceding sections allow us to deal with problems in one - dimensional quantum statistical mechanics by means of a semiclassical expansion which is fully calculable and yields nonperturbative results .",
    "problems in higher - dimensional quantum statistical mechanics with potentials that have spherical symmetry may be reduced , by means of partial - wave decompositions , to one - dimensional problems wherein our methods could be applied .",
    "furthermore , in finite temperature field theory , where the point @xmath15 of our previous treatment is to be replaced with the ( static ) field configuration , @xmath172 , we already see the need to consider extrema which must depend on @xmath139 , the euclidean time , as we lower the temperature .",
    "catastrophes will certainly occur , forcing us to rethink commonly used approximations that use constant field configurations as backgrounds to derive effective potentials . here",
    ", again , under very special circumstances , one might hope that the methods developed so far may shed some light into the intrincacies of nonperturbative phenomena .",
