    "the enumeration of polyominoes is a topic of great interest to chemists , physicists and combinatorialists alike . in chemical terms",
    ", any polyomino ( with hexagonal cells ) is a possible benzenoid hydrocarbon . in physics ,",
    "determining the number of @xmath7-celled polyominoes is related to the study of two - dimensional percolation phenomena . in combinatorics , polyominoes are of interest in their own right because several polyomino models have good - looking exact solutions .",
    "known results for polyominoes include the fact that the number of @xmath7-celled polyominoes grows exponentially .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath8 denotes the number of @xmath7-celled polyominoes , then    * @xmath9 * @xmath10    the first result follows from standard concatenation arguments , see e.g. @xcite , while the second result , due to madras @xcite relies on a pattern theorem for lattice animals .",
    "these results are quite general , and apply _ mutatis mutandis _ to the new polyomino models we consider here .",
    "one can also obtain rigorous bounds on the growth constant @xmath11 for example , for hexagonal polyominoes we have @xcite @xmath12 a lower bound is immediately obtainable from the first itemised equation above , and it can be improved with rather more work .",
    "the upper bound is obtained by a method due to klarner and rivest @xcite , which relies on mapping each polyomino onto a tree on the dual lattice , and relaxing the rules for tree construction so that over - counting results .",
    "one very popular polyomino model is that of _ column - convex polyominoes_. column - convex polyominoes with hexagonal cells have a rational area generating function . that generating function was found by klarner in 1967 @xcite .",
    "the _ growth constant _ of hexagonal - celled column - convex polyominoes is @xmath4 .",
    "( by the growth constant we mean the limit @xmath13{a_n}$ ] , where @xmath8 denotes the number of @xmath7-celled elements in a given set of polyominoes . )    in a previous paper @xcite , one of us ( fereti ) began to search for polyomino models which are more general than column - convex polyominoes , but still have reasonably simple area generating functions . in @xcite , fereti introduced _ level _ @xmath0 _ cheesy polyominoes _ ( @xmath14 ) , and here we shall introduce another sequence of models , which we call _ level _ @xmath0 _ column - subconvex polyominoes _ ( @xmath14 ) .    at every level ,",
    "cheesy polyominoes have a rational area generating function , whereas column - subconvex polyominoes have an area generating function which is unlikely to be algebraic , and indeed , unlikely to be differentiably finite @xcite .",
    "further , at any given level , cheesy polyominoes are an exponentially small subset of column - subconvex polyominoes .",
    "the latter set of polyominoes has a greater growth constant than the former set .",
    "for example , the growth constant of level one cheesy polyominoes is @xmath15 , while the growth constant of level one column - subconvex polyominoes is @xmath2 . in addition , if we reflect a column - subconvex polyomino about a vertical axis , we get a column - subconvex polyomino again .",
    "this kind of invariance under reflection is enjoyed by column - convex polyominoes , but not by cheesy polyominoes .",
    "admittedly , counting level @xmath0 column - subconvex polyominoes requires more effort than counting level @xmath0 cheesy polyominoes .",
    "anyway , at level one , column - subconvex polyominoes are not very hard to count .",
    "just as with cheesy polyominoes , as the level increases , the computations quickly increase in size .    in this paper ,",
    "the level one column - subconvex model is solved in full detail .",
    "we also solved the level two column - subconvex model . to see the level two result ( stated with no proof ) ,",
    "the reader may visit the web page @xcite .",
    "the said result involves too many auxiliary expressions to be stated in this paper .",
    "( to be specific , there are @xmath16 auxiliary expressions , of which @xmath17 are polynomials ; the degree of those polynomials is between @xmath18 and @xmath19 . )",
    "our computations are done by using bousquet - mlou s @xcite and svrtan s  @xcite `` turbo '' version of the temperley method @xcite .",
    "if the reader would like to have more information on the history of polyomino enumeration , or on the role which polyominoes play in physics and chemistry , then he / she may refer to bousquet - mlou s habilitation thesis @xcite , or to the book @xcite .",
    "there are three regular tilings of the euclidean plane , namely the triangular tiling , the square tiling , and the hexagonal tiling .",
    "we adopt the convention that every square tile or hexagonal tile has two horizontal edges . in a regular tiling ,",
    "a tile is often referred to as a _",
    "cell_. a plane figure @xmath20 is a polyomino if @xmath20 is a union of finitely many cells and the interior of @xmath20 is connected . see figure  1 .",
    "observe that , if a union of _ hexagonal _ cells is connected , then it possesses a connected interior as well .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 be two polyominoes .",
    "we consider @xmath20 and @xmath21 to be equal if and only if there exists a translation @xmath22 such that @xmath23 .",
    "if a polyomino @xmath20 is made up of @xmath7 cells , we say that the _ area _ of @xmath20 is @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath24 be a set of polyominoes . by the _ area generating function _ of @xmath24 we mean the formal sum    @xmath25    from now on , we concentrate on the hexagonal tiling .",
    "when we write `` a polyomino '' , we actually mean `` a hexagonal - celled polyomino '' .    given a polyomino @xmath20 , it is useful to partition the cells of @xmath20 according to their horizontal projection .",
    "each block of that partition is a _ column _ of @xmath20 .",
    "note that a column of a polyomino is not necessarily a connected set .",
    "an example of this is the highlighted column in figure 1 . on the other hand",
    ", it may happen that every column of a polyomino @xmath20 is a connected set . in this case",
    ", the polyomino @xmath20 is a _ column - convex polyomino_. see figure 2 .",
    "let @xmath26 be a column of a polyomino @xmath20 . by the _ height _ of @xmath26 we mean the number of those cells which make up @xmath26 plus the number of those ( zero or more ) cells which make up the gaps of @xmath26 .",
    "for example , in figure 1 , the highlighted column has height @xmath27 , and the next column to the left has height @xmath28 .",
    "a finite union of cells @xmath20 is a _ level _",
    "@xmath0 _ column - subconvex polyomino _ if the following holds :    * @xmath20 is a polyomino , * every column of @xmath20 has at most two connected components , * if a column of @xmath20 has two connected components , then the gap between the components consists of at most @xmath0 cells .",

    "let @xmath20 be an element of @xmath29 and let @xmath20 have at least two columns .",

    "see figure 4 .",
    "observe that the pivot cell of @xmath20 is not necessarily contained in @xmath20 .",
    "when we build a column - convex polyomino from left to right , adding one column at a time , every intermediate figure is a column - convex polyomino itself .",
    "however , when we build a column - subconvex polyomino , this is no longer the case .",
    "a `` left factor '' of an element of @xmath29 need not itself be a polyomino , and therefore need not be an element of @xmath29 .",
    "we say that a figure @xmath20 is an _ incomplete level one column - subconvex polyomino _ if @xmath20 itself is not an element of @xmath29 , but @xmath20 is a `` left factor '' of an element of @xmath29 .",
    "notice that , if @xmath20 is an incomplete level one column - subconvex polyomino , then the last ( _ i.e. _ , the rightmost ) column of @xmath20 necessarily has a hole .",

    "let @xmath20 be an element of @xmath31 and let @xmath20 have at least two columns .",

    "let @xmath104 . once again , the second",

    "otherwise the upper component of the last column would be connected with the rest of @xmath20 , and @xmath20 would be a polyomino .",

    "we have chosen to state the formula for @xmath154 in the electronic form only @xcite .    however , the taylor series expansion of @xmath154 is    @xmath157    and the critical point of @xmath154 is at @xmath158 .",
