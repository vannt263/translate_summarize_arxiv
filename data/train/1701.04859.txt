    "galactic globular clusters are very important for the study of the halo and bulge regions of our galaxy . in particular , they are the best tools to understand the kinematics and dynamics of the halo region of the milky way by the virtue of being easily distinguishable at large distances ( cudworth 1997 , dambis 2006 ) . since the emergence of ccds , proper motion ( pm ) studies can be carried out with unprecedented precision using ccd data with smaller epoch differences than data from photographic plates .",
    "proper motions are the root to learn about the kinematics and orbit of the clusters as well as providing kinematical membership probabilities of the stars .",
    "membership status is often pivotal to spectroscopic studies , to avoid observing field stars lying in the cluster s field ( cudworth 1986 ) . at fainter magnitudes , in particular , field stars dominate , and proper motions become very important in removing them from the sample ( piotto et al .",

    "since the cluster is less centrally concentrated than most other globular clusters , even ground based telescopes can probe its central region . due to this advantage and its proximity , ngc 3201 has been studied extensively for photometric studies ( menzies 1967 , alcaino 1976 , lee 1977 , alcaino et al . 1981,1989 , cacciari 1984a , 1984b , penny 1984 , brewer et al .",
