    "almost every summer , there is a heat wave somewhere in the us that garners popular media attention @xcite . during such hot spells , daily record high temperatures for various cities",
    "are routinely reported in local news reports .",
    "a natural question arises : is global warming the cause of such heat waves or are they merely statistical fluctuations ? intuitively , record - breaking temperature events should become less frequent with time if the average temperature is stationary .",
    "thus it is natural to be concerned that global warming is playing a role when there is a proliferation of record - breaking temperature events . in this work ,",
    "we investigate how systematic climatic changes , such as global warming , affect the magnitude and frequency of record - breaking temperatures .",
    "we then assess the potential role of global warming by comparing our predictions both to record temperature data and to monte carlo simulation results .",
    "it bears emphasizing that record - breaking temperatures are distinct from threshold events , defined as observations that fall outside a specified threshold of the climatological temperature distribution @xcite .",
    "thus , for example , if a city s record temperature for a particular day is @xmath0c , then an increase in the frequency of daily temperatures above @xmath1c ( _ i.e. _ , above the @xmath2 percentile ) is a threshold event , but not a record - breaking event .",
    "trends in threshold temperature events are also impacted by climate change , and is thus an active research area @xcite .",
    "studying threshold events is also one of the ways to assess agricultural , ecological , and human health effects due to climate change @xcite .",
    "here we examine the complementary issue of record - breaking temperatures , in part because they are popularized by the media during heat waves and they influence public perception of climate change , and in part because of the fundamental issues associated with record statistics .",
    "we focus on daily temperature extremes in the city of philadelphia , for which data are readily available on the internet for the period 18741999 @xcite .",
    "in particular , we study how temperature records evolve in time for each _ fixed _ day of the year .",
    "that is , if a record temperature occurs on january 1 , 1875 , how long until the next record on january 1 occurs ? using the fact that the daily temperature distribution is well approximated by a gaussian ( sec .",
    "[ t - data ] ) , we will apply basic ideas from extreme value statistics in sec .",
    "[ etr ] to predict the magnitude of the temperature jump when a new record is set , as well as the time between successive records on a given day .",
    "these predictions are derived for an arbitrary daily temperature distribution , and then we work out specific results for the idealized case of an exponential daily temperature distribution and for the more realistic gaussian distribution .",
    "although individual record temperature events are fluctuating quantities , the average size of the temperature jumps between successive records and the frequency of these records are systematic functions of time ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite for a general discussion ) .",
    "this systematic behavior permits us to make meaningful comparisons between our theoretical predictions , numerical simulations ( sec .",
    "[ simulations ] ) , and the data for record temperature events in philadelphia ( sec .",
    "[ trd ] ) .",
    "clearly , it would be desirable to study long - term temperature data from many locations to discriminate between the expected number of record events for a stationary climate and for global warming . for u.s .",
    "cities , however , daily temperature records extend back only 100140 years @xcite , and there are both gaps in the data and questions about systematic effects caused by `` heat islands '' for observation points in urban areas . in spite of these practical limitations , the philadelphia data provide a useful testing ground for our theoretical predictions .    in sec .",
    "[ sct ] , we investigate the effect of a slow linear global warming trend @xcite on the statistics of record - high and record - low temperature events .",
    "we argue that the presently - available 126 years of data in philadelphia , coupled with the current global warming rate , are insufficient to meaningfully alter the frequency of record temperature events compared to predictions based on a stationary temperature .",
    "this conclusion is our main result .",
    "finally , we study the role of correlations in the daily temperatures on the statistics of record temperature events in sec .",
    "although there are substantial correlations between temperatures on nearby days and record temperature events tend to occur in streaks , these correlations do not affect the frequency of record temperature events for a given day .",
    "we summarize and offer some perspectives in sec .",
    "the temperature data for philadelphia were obtained from a website of the earth and mineral sciences department at pennsylvania state university @xcite .",
    "the data contain both the low and high temperatures in philadelphia for each day between 1874 and 1999 .",
    "the data are reported as an integer in degrees fahrenheit , so we anticipate an error of @xmath3f .",
    "no information is provided about the accuracy of the measurement or the precise location where the temperature is measured .",
    "thus there is no provision for correcting for the heat island effect if the weather station is in an increasingly urbanized location during the observation period . for each day",
    ", we also document the middle temperature , defined as the average of the daily high and daily low .    to get a feeling for the nature of the data , we first present basic observations about the average annual temperature and the variation of the temperature during a typical year .",
    "figure  [ av - temps ] shows the average annual high , middle , and low temperature for each year between 1874 and 1999 . to help discern systematic trends",
    ", we also plot 10-year averages for each data set .",
    "the average high temperature for each year is increasing from 1874 until approximately 1950 and again after 1965 , but is decreasing from 1950 to 1965 . over the 126 years of data",
    ", a linear fit to the time dependence of the annual high temperature for philadelphia gives an increase of @xmath4c , compared to the well - documented global warming rate of @xmath5c over the past century @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there does not appear to be a systematic trend in the dependence of the annual low temperature on the year .",
    "a linear fit to these data give a _ decrease _ of @xmath6c .",
    "this disparity between high and low temperatures is a puzzling and as yet unexplained feature of the data .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a basic feature about the daily temperature is its approximately sinusoidal annual variation ( fig .",
    "[ daily - avs+recs ] ) .",
    "the coldest time of the year is early february while the warmest is late july .",
    "an amusing curiosity is the discernible small peak during the period january 2025 .",
    "this anomaly is the traditional `` january thaw '' in the northeastern us where sometimes snowpack can melt and a spring - like aura occurs before winter returns ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of this phenomenon ) .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=40.0% ]    also shown , in fig .",
    "[ daily - avs+recs ] , are the temperature extremes for each day .",
    "the highest recorded temperature in philadelphia of @xmath7c ( @xmath8f ) occurred on august 7 , 1918 , while the lowest temperature of @xmath9c ( @xmath10f ) occurred on february 9 , 1934 .",
    "record temperatures also fluctuate more strongly than the mean temperature because there are only 126 years of temperature data . as a result of this short time span",
    ", some days of the year have experienced very few records and the resulting current extreme temperature can be far from the value that is expected on statistical grounds ( see sec .  [ trd ] ) .      to understand the magnitude and frequency of daily record temperatures , we need the underlying temperature distribution for each day of the year . because temperatures have been recorded for only 126 years , the temperature distribution for each individual day is not smooth . to mitigate this problem , we aggregate the temperatures over a 9-day range and then use these aggregated data to define the temperature distribution for the middle day in this range . thus , for example , for the temperature distribution on january 5 , we aggregate all 126 years of temperatures from january 19 ( 1134 data points ) .",
    "we also use the middle temperature for each day to define the temperature distribution .",
    "range10 , 9 , 8 , and 6 points respectively , for january 5 , april 5 , october 5 , and july 5 .",
    "the distributions are all shifted horizontally by the mean temperature for the day and then vertically to render all curves distinct .",
    "the dashed curves are visually - determined gaussian fits .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure  [ temp - dist-9day ] shows these aggregated temperature distributions for four representative days ",
    "the @xmath11 of january , april , july , and october .",
    "each distribution is shifted vertically to make them all non - overlapping .",
    "we also subtracted the mean temperature from each of the distributions , so that they are all centered about zero .",
    "visually , we obtain good fits to these distributions with the gaussian @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the deviation of the temperature from its mean value ( in @xmath14c ) , and with @xmath15 , 4.32 , 4.12 , and 3.14 for january 5 , april 5 , october 5 , and july 5 , respectively .",
    "we therefore use a gaussian daily temperature distribution as the input to our investigation of the frequency of record temperatures in the next section .",
    "an important caveat needs to be made about the daily temperature distribution .",
    "physically , this distribution can not be gaussian _",
    "ad infinitum_. instead , the distribution must cut off more sharply at finite temperature values that reflect basic physical limitations ( such as the boiling points of water and nitrogen ) .",
    "we will show in the next section that such a cutoff strongly influences the average waiting time between successive temperature records on a given day .",
    "notice that the width of the daily temperature distribution is largest in the winter and smallest in the summer .",
    "another intriguing aspect of the daily distributions is the tail behavior . for january 5 , there are deviations from a gaussian at both at the high- and low - temperature extremes , while for april 5 and october 5 , there is an enhancement only on the high - temperature side .",
    "this enhancement is especially pronounced on april 5 , which corresponds to the season where record high temperatures are most likely to occur ( see sec .",
    "[ disc ] and fig .",
    "[ daily - var ] ) .",
    "what is not possible to determine with 126 years of data is whether the true temperature distribution is gaussian up to the cutoff points and the enhancement results from relatively few data , or whether the true temperature distribution on april 5 actually has a slower than gaussian high - temperature decay .",
    "we now determine theoretically the frequency and magnitude of record temperature events .",
    "the schematic evolution of these two characteristics is sketched in fig .",
    "[ record - evolution ] for the case of record high temperatures .",
    "each time a record high for a _ fixed _ day of the year is set , we document the year @xmath16 when the @xmath17 record occurred and the corresponding record high temperature @xmath18 . under the (",
    "unrealistic ) assumptions that the temperatures for each day are independent and identical , we now calculate the average values of @xmath18 and @xmath16 and their underlying probability distributions ( for a general discussion of record statistics for excursions past a fixed threshold , see _",

    "[ record - evolution],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    suppose that the daily temperature distribution is @xmath26 .",
    "two subsidiary distributions needed for record statistics are : ( i ) the probability that a randomly - drawn temperature _ exceeds _",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 , and ( ii ) the probability that that this randomly - selected temperature _ is less than _ @xmath27 , @xmath29 .",
    "these distributions are @xcite : @xmath30    we now determine the @xmath31 record temperature @xmath32 recursively .",
    "we use the terminology of record high temperatures , but the same formalism applies for record lows . clearly @xmath33 coincides with the mean of the daily temperature distribution , @xmath34 .",
    "the next record temperature is the mean value of that portion of the temperature distribution that lies beyond @xmath33 : that is , @xmath35 this formula actually contains a sleight of hand .",
    "more properly , we should average the above expression over the probability distribution for @xmath33 to obtain the true average value of @xmath20 , rather than merely using the typical or the average value of @xmath33 in the lower limit of the integral .",
    "equation  ( [ t1 ] ) therefore does not give the true average value of @xmath20 , but rather gives what we term the _ typical _ value of @xmath20 .",
    "we will show how to compute the average value shortly .",
    "proceeding recursively , the relation between successive typical record temperatures is given by @xmath36 where the above caveat about using the typical value of @xmath32 in the lower limit , rather than the average over the ( as yet ) unknown distribution of @xmath32 , still applies .",
    "we now compute @xmath37 , the probability that the @xmath31 record temperature equals @xmath27 ; this distribution is subject to the initial condition @xmath38 .",
    "for the @xmath31 record temperature , the following conditions must be satisfied ( refer to fig .  [ record - evolution ] ) : ( i ) the previous record temperature @xmath39 must be less than @xmath27 , ( ii ) the next @xmath40 temperatures , with @xmath40 arbitrary , must all be less than @xmath39 , and ( iii ) the last temperature must equal @xmath27 . writing the appropriate probabilities for each of these events , we obtain @xmath41^n \\ , dt'\\right ) p(t )   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left(\\int_0^{t } \\frac{\\mathcal{p}_{k-1}(t')}{p_>(t ' ) } \\ , dt'\\right ) p(t)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above formula recursively gives the probability distribution for each record temperature in terms of the distribution for the previous record .",
    "complementary to the magnitude of record temperatures , we determine the time between successive records .",
    "suppose that the current record temperature equals @xmath32 and let @xmath42 be the probability that a new record high  the @xmath43is set @xmath40 years later .",
    "for this new record , the first @xmath44 highs after the current record must all be less than @xmath32 , while the @xmath45 high temperature must exceed @xmath32 .",
    "thus @xmath46 the number of years between the @xmath31 record high @xmath32 and the @xmath43 record @xmath47 is therefore @xmath48 we emphasize that this waiting time gives the time between the @xmath31 record and the @xmath43 record when the @xmath31 record temperature equals the specified value @xmath32 . if the typical value of @xmath32 is used in eq .",
    "( [ nav ] ) , we thus obtain a quantity that we term the typical value of @xmath49 .    to obtain the true average waiting time",

    "@xcite .",
    "there are a number of fundamental results available about record statistics that are _ universal _ and do not depend on the form of the initial daily temperature distribution , as long as the daily temperatures are independent and identically - distributed ( iid ) continuous variables @xcite . in a string of @xmath54 observations ( starting at time @xmath55 ) ,",
    "there are @xmath56 permutations of the temperatures out of @xmath57 total possibilities in which the largest temperature is the last of the string .",
    "thus the probability that a new record occurs in the @xmath45 year of observation , @xmath58 , is simply @xcite @xmath59    in a similar vein , the probability that the initial ( @xmath60 ) record is broken at the @xmath45 observation , @xmath61 , requires that the last temperature is the largest while the @xmath60 temperature is the second largest out of @xmath54 independent variables .",
    "the probability for this event is therefore @xmath62 again independent of the form of the daily temperature distribution .",
    "thus the average waiting time between the zeroth and first records , @xmath63 is infinite !",
    "more generally , the distribution of times between successive records can be obtained by simple reasoning @xcite .",

    "thus the statistics of the first 3.6 record high temperatures should be indistinguishable from those in a stationary climate , after which record temperatures should occur at a constant rate .",
    "since the average number of record high temperatures for a given day is 4.7 and the time until the next record high is very roughly @xmath204 years , we are still far from the point where global warming could have an unambiguous effect on the frequency of record high temperatures .    for global cooling ( @xmath205 ) ,",

    "if the daily low temperature in philadelphia also experienced a warming rate of @xmath202c per year , then there should be no additional record low temperatures after about 36 years of observations .",

    ", we studied the distribution of times ( in days ) between successive record events , as well as the distribution of streaks ( consecutive days ) of record temperatures from the time history of all record temperature events .    because the number of record temperatures decreases from year to year , these time and streak distributions are not stationary .",

    ", we rescale each interevent time by the average time between records for that year .",

    "[ record - time - dist],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the distribution of times between successive record temperature days decays slower than exponentially ( fig .",

    ", we observe an enhanced probability for records to occur in streaks .",
    "since record streaks are rare , we can only make the qualitative statement that the streak distribution is different than that from uncorrelated data .",
    "our basic conclusion is that interday temperature correlations do affect statistical features of successive record temperature events but do not affect the statistics of record temperatures on a given day , where events are more than one year apart .",
    "two basic aspects of record temperature events are the size of the temperature jump when a new record occurs and the separation in years between successive records on a given day .",

    "this latter result is independent of @xmath131 so that systematic changes in temperature variability should not affect the time between temperature records .    from these predictions ,",
    "the distribution of waiting times between two successive records on a given day has an inverse - square power - law tail , with a divergent average waiting time .",
    "furthermore , the number of record events in the @xmath175 year of observations decays as @xmath270 @xcite .",
    "these theoretical predictions agree with numerical simulations and with data from 126 years of observations in philadelphia .",
    "another important feature is that the annual frequency of record temperature events is not measurably influenced by interday power - law temperature however , these correlations do play a significant role at shorter time scales .",
    "our primary result is that we can not _ yet _ distinguish between the effects of random fluctuations and long - term systematic trends on the frequency of record - breaking temperatures with 126 years of data .",
    "for example , in the @xmath271 year of observation , there should be @xmath272 record - high temperature events in a stationary climate , while our simulations give @xmath273 such events in a climate that is warming at a rate of @xmath274c per 100 years .",
    "however , the variation from year to year in the frequency of record events after 100 years is larger than the difference of @xmath275 , which should be expected because of global warming ( fig .",
    "[ max - warming ] ) .",
    "after 200 years , this random variation in the frequency of record events is still larger than the effect of global warming . on the other hand , global warming already does affect the frequency of extreme temperature events that are defined by exceeding a fixed threshold @xcite .",
    "while the agreement between our theory and the data for record temperature statistics is satisfying , there are various facts that we have either glossed over or ignored .",
    "these include : ( i ) a significant difference between the number of record high and record low events1705 record high events and only 1346 record low events have occurred the 126 years of data .",
    "( ii ) a propensity for record high temperatures in the early spring .",
    "this seasonality is illustrated both by the number of records for each day of the year and by the daily temperature variance @xmath276 , where @xmath243 and @xmath277 are the mean and mean - square temperatures for the @xmath17 day ( fig .",
    "[ daily - var ] ) .",
    "( iii ) the potential role of a systematically increasing variability on the frequency of records .",
    "for the last point , krug @xcite has shown that for an exponential daily temperature distribution whose width is increasing linearly with time , the number of record events after @xmath67 years grows as @xmath278 , intermediate to the @xmath70 growth of a stationary distribution and linear growth when the average temperature systematically increases .",
    "( iv ) day / night or high / low asymmetry @xcite . that is , as a function of time there are more days whose highs exceeds a given threshold and fewer days whose high is less than a threshold .",
    "paradoxically , however , there are fewer days whose lows exceed a given temperature and more days whose lows are less than a given temperature . since highs generally occur in daytime and lows in nighttime , these results can be restated as follows : the number of hot days is increasing _ and _ the number of cold nights is increasing .",
    "we do nt know how this latter statement fits with the phenomenon of global warming .",
    "another caveat is that our theory applies in the asymptotic limit , where each day has experienced a large number of record temperatures over the observational history .",
    "the fact that there are no more than 10 record events on any single day means that we are far from the regime where the asymptotic limit truly applies .",

    "<S> , we argue that the current warming rate is insufficient to measurably influence the frequency of record temperature events , a conclusion that is supported by numerical simulations and by the philadelphia data . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the role of correlations between temperatures on successive days and find that they do not affect the frequency or magnitude of record temperature events . </S>"
