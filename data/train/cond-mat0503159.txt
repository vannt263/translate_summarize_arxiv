    "are events in a self - organized criticality ( soc )  @xcite system random or correlated ? this is a still ongoing and important topic of discussion in the soc community that has been argued from both sides to propose or invalidate practical tests for soc behavior  @xcite .",
    "one specific point of this dialogue concerns the distribution of the amount of time between the initiation of successive events ( waiting , laminar or first return times ) in a system suspected of exhibiting soc behaviour . at issue",
    "is whether or not the probability density function ( pdf ) of this measure should always scale exponentially or as a power law for a soc system .",
    "three recent examples of this are drawn from space plasma physics  @xcite , laboratory confined fusion plasma physics  @xcite and earthquake geophysics  @xcite .",
    "the authors of all of these studies first assume that events in a soc system must be uncorrelated .",
    "they then report observations of waiting times distributed as power laws and draw separate but similar conclusions that the systems ( space plasma , fusion plasma , earthquakes ) dynamics can not be consistent with soc .",
    "the root of this controversy is to be found in the misconceptions that `` strong correlations between successive [ events is ] at variance with the soc model ''  @xcite and that an event `` can occur randomly anywhere at any time and  cannot ` know ' how large it will become ''  @xcite .",
    "based on these statements , the idea of exponentially distributed waiting times could be easily derived  @xcite .",
    "but it has been known for some time that these notions simply do not hold in a soc system  @xcite .",
    "they were probably encouraged , in the early days of soc , by analytical calculations  @xcite that appeared to reproduce quite well the power spectrum of the avalanche activity observed in the bak - tang - wiesenfeld ( btw ) sandpile  @xcite ( and later in the directed running sandpile  @xcite ) when modeling it as a random superposition of events with power law distributed sizes . since then",
    ", a state of confusion that still persists appears to surround this issue , at least among those looking for soc features in physical systems , with quite a few papers accepting  @xcite and others denying  @xcite the validity of these notions .    in this paper",
    "we show explicitly that features exist in the power spectra of soc systems that signify dynamical correlations and that , therefore , any assumption or test based on the absence of temporal correlations is meaningless . by ` dynamical ' we mean that temporal correlations are caused by the system dynamics , not by a hypothetical non - randomness in the external drive  @xcite . to study them , we have examined the avalanche activity time series of the same one dimensional running sandpile model analyzed in ref .  @xcite as our prototypical soc model .",
    "the benefit of using this model is that it allows us to analyze systems with a finite drive strength instead of just the vanishing drive limit in which the absorbing phase transition responsible for the appearance of criticality and universal behaviour was identified  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in many practical applications a finite drive is more appropriate .",
    "this is the case , for instance , in most magnetized plasmas , either inside the sun  @xcite or confined in an earth - based tokamak  @xcite .    taking advantage of increased computer power over that available at the time of ref .",
    "@xcite we explore timescales up to four decades longer than those used in that study for varying driving rates and system sizes .",
    "because of this , dynamical correlations not previously detected in the power spectrum of the avalanche activity time series ( associated with @xmath0 power law regions of exponent @xmath1 ) are now apparent .",
    "the exponent is found to increase with the drive strength , reaching @xmath2 only at the higher drives .",
    "we show that this is not a signature of the increasing dominance of avalanche overlapping ( as stated previously in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but just a consequence of the fact that the timescales where the correlations are present are also displaced towards higher frequencies at stronger drives . therefore ,",
    "avalanche overlapping is not the cause of the @xmath3  region seen in the directed running sandpile .",
    "the changing value of @xmath4 might seem to suggest that the character of the correlations is changing with the drive as we move away from the critical point .",
    "however , when analyzing the same activity signals with rescaled range ( @xmath5 ) analysis  @xcite to estimate the hurst exponent @xmath6 , a very different conclusion is drawn .",
    "dynamical correlations are associated with @xmath7 .",
    "we find a _ constant _ hurst exponent @xmath8 for _ all values of driving rate _ over the same timescales described above , where @xmath9 in the power spectrum .",
    "@xmath6 remains constant as @xmath4  changes from @xmath10 at the lowest driving rate studied here to @xmath11 at the highest driving rates .",
    "interestingly , in the vanishing drive limit  @xcite we find the same value of @xmath6 . in this natural limit of the running sandpile model ,",
    "avalanches do not overlap , by definition , because the external drive is turned off as soon as an event is initiated .",
    "the origin of the correlations must thus be found , then , in a mechanism other than avalanche overlap .",
    "specifically , the origin of temporal correlations in the sandpile model is the shape of the system profiles , carved by past avalanches , where the memory of the system history is stored .    in this report",
    ", we do not set out to prove that temporal correlations exist in a soc system . in the words of a helpful referee ,",
    "`` there is no question whether correlations exist in self - organized or any other critical systems .",
    "they do , basically by definition . ''",
    "such correlations can be proved through the existence of diverging correlation lengths and times @xcite .",
    "given that temporal correlations exist in soc systems , our goals are to lay to rest the controversy mentioned in the first paragraph and to address the questions : how does one identify temporal correlations in a real system ? what measures should one use ?",
    "what do those measures say ?",
    "what mechanism(s ) produce(s ) the correlations ?",
    "we use the power spectrum and @xmath5  analysis  in this study but do not claim that they are the only possible applicable measures .",
    "multiple measures should be used for completely thorough studies of dynamical systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] the basics of the running sandpile and analysis techniques are reviewed .",
    "numerical results obtained for the avalanche activity time series are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the running sandpile can be described by four parameters : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14  and @xmath15 .",
    "consider a single column of @xmath12  cells .",
    "each cell contains an integer number of `` sand grains '' ; this number is the height of the cell .",
    "sand is added to each cell by a random `` rain '' from above .",
    "that is , at each time step for each cell , there is a probability @xmath16 that a grain of sand will be added to it .",
    "the average input current into the entire system is @xmath17 grains per time step .",
    "the local gradient @xmath18  is the difference in height between two neighboring cells .",
    "if this local gradient exceeds a critical gradient @xmath14  then an avalanche occurs .",
    "an avalanche stabilizes the local gradient by transferring @xmath15  grains of sand from the higher cell to the lower in a single event called a flip  @xcite or a toppling ( the more standard term ) .",
    "this avalanche can make @xmath19  and/or @xmath20  unstable at the next time step so that the avalanche spreads to other cells . in this way ,",
    "spatially and temporally extended events in a system can occur .",
    "this sandpile can be extended to two or more dimensions  @xcite but we will only discuss the one dimensional case . for this study ,",
    "we want to explore the effects of changing system size ( @xmath12 ) and external driving rate ( probability @xmath13 ) so we have arbitrarily fixed the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the system dynamics does not qualitatively change for different values of @xmath14  and @xmath15 , as long as @xmath23 .    note",
    "that time is well - defined in this running sandpile model as opposed to the vanishing drive model ( the original btw model , for instance ) where external forcing ( sand addition ) is suspended as long as there is activity in the system . in this running sandpile , sand can be added at each cell at every time step with a probability @xmath13even if an avalanche is active .",
    "when we increase the level of external forcing by increasing @xmath13 , we increase the probabilty of a grain of sand being added to each cell and therefore increase the probabilty of an avalanche .",
    "but we do not change the time step  the clock continues to tick regularly regardless of system activity .",
    "computationally , this requires simultaneous random adding of grains ( forcing ) and checking for instability ( relaxation ) within the same programming loop . a natural time scale for the system ,",
    "then , can be thought of as @xmath24 .",
    "the time series that we analyze is the instantaneous total avalanche activity or , in short , the _ activity _ @xmath25 , which is defined as the total number of unstable sites ( where @xmath26 ) at each time step .",
    "an unstable cell transports @xmath15  grains of sand to the next cell .",
    "the activity at each time step can be thought of as the instantaneous ( potential ) energy dissipation in the system or the total instantaneous flux through it .",
    "avalanches in a @xmath25  time series appear as structures  sequential nonzero activity separated by periods of inactivity , or quiet times .",
    "we analyze activity data for times after steady state has been reached , which is when the long time average number of topplings approaches a constant value .",
    "two temporal measures from the activity series are discussed in this paper : durations and quiet times .",
    "a duration is the number of time steps during which the system is active ; we refer to this as an avalanche .",
    "note that for the running sandpile that we use in this study , an avalanche defined in this way could actually comprise two or more distinct avalanches that happen to be active at the same time in the system . at high drive",
    ", this tends to be the case but at low drive individual avalanches can be distinguished through analysis of the pulse shape in the activity time series .",
    "a quiet time is defined as the length of an uninterrupted sequence of zero topplings ( inactivity ) between two avalanches .",
    "it is the length of time that the system is in an absorbing state . in the randomly driven sandpile , probability density functions ( pdfs ) of unadulterated avalanche durations scale as a power law in the self - similar range  @xcite while the pdfs of quiet times scale exponentially  @xcite .",
    "an important part of this study is to quantify the effect of changing the drive strength and system size on correlations .",
    "first , it is important to note that for critical dynamics to exist , the system must not only be underdriven ( i.e. , the flux in , @xmath27 , must never exceed the maximum possible flux out of the bottom cell , @xmath28 ) , but it must also satisfy @xmath29 , so that a cell can alternate between stable and unstable until the avalanche ends or washes past the cell  @xcite .",
    "second , note that the difference between driving close / far from the condition @xmath30 is to increase / decrease the degree of avalanche overlapping .",
    "that is , if @xmath31 then there will be very few cases of simultaneous avalanches and hence very little avalanche overlapping . in practise",
    ", @xmath32  can be set as small as desired to effectively eliminate all overlapping , thus allowing identification and analysis of single avalanches . in this limit ,",
    "avalanche dynamics and statistics are the same as the vanishing drive ( non - running ) sandpile of @xcite .",
    "we want to quantify the amount of temporal event overlapping and we want to compare systems of different sizes ( @xmath12 ) . if the average avalanche duration @xmath33 is greater than the average trigger time @xmath34",
    "@xcite then avalanches will overlap and therefore the condition for overlapping in time is @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "( this is in contrast to the limit for spatial overlap previously given in eq .",
    "( 4 ) in  @xcite . ) for a fixed @xmath37 , this condition encompasses both size and drive strength so we define the _ effective driving rate _ as @xmath38 . at steady state",
    ", of course , flux into and out of the system are still equal , @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40  is simply a parameter defined to compare systems of different sizes that have proportional levels of overlapping . in what follows , _",
    "low drive _ will refer to systems where overlapping of events is negligible ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) , and _ high drive _ will refer to cases when overlapping becomes significant ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : timeserieslowhigh ] ) . this will be discussed further in section  [ sec : size - drive ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the same value of @xmath43 is found for this region regardless of system size or driving rate , even in the vanishing drive limit in which soc is strictly defined  @xcite .",
    "this simple fact suggests that the correlations present at the soc critical point do persist almost without distortion at finite drives .",
    "in fact , this is still the case even at the highest drives , when avalanches do overlap and form superpulses .",
    "a superpulse is defined as the structure between successive quiet times in a high drive activity time series ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timeserieslowhigh](b ) ) .",
    "note that quiet times in the high drive cases are very small , on average . by randomly shuffling the superpulses of a high drive time series",
    ", we see that the correlations that lead to @xmath8 are on time scales shorter than the average superpulse . beyond these time scales ,",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 , signatures of uncorrelated data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrarshighsuperpulse ] ) .",
    "understanding the power spectrum of region d is not as simple as for the @xmath5 analysis .",
    "the slope of this region , @xmath4 , changes with driving rate and with system size .",
    "@xmath3 regions are only obtained for high drives ( or by removing the quiet times of low drive cases , which makes the system approach the zero drive limit as previously discussed ) .",
    "this implies that a @xmath3 region is not a necessary signature of soc dynamics at finite drives , since correlations are still present , as indicated by the hurst exponent remaining constant at @xmath43 . in this sense , @xmath5 analysis is a more robust measure of the degree of correlations among events than is the power spectrum .",
    "analysis  for fractional gaussian noise of @xmath46 with and without quiet times added .",
    "numbers shown are @xmath4 for spectra and @xmath6  for @xmath5 . ]    the question , however , remains open about why @xmath4  changes as region d is pushed towards different timescales , and why @xmath4  saturates at @xmath47 and not another value .",
    "we do not know the answer , but we can say a couple of things .",
    "first , it appears that @xmath3  is due more to a lack of quiet times and distinct pulse shapes than to overlapping , at least in the sandpile model .",
    "we showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerrsorigshufnq ] that removing all quiet times from between separate events of a low drive activity time series produces a spectrum with a region d where @xmath48 . in that case",
    ", there is no overlapping of events by design .",
    "we can also discard the need for hidden additional correlations being established dynamically , since the same change in @xmath4  is observed when inserting randomly - distributed quiet times into an artificial time series of fractional gaussian noise ( fgn ) @xcite with an arbitrary hurst exponent @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fgn__8_power_rs_pii ] ) .",
    "we inserted quiet times with an average approximately the same as the average of the original fgn series ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the spectrum and @xmath5  analysis  are shown for the original and modified series .",
    "the original fgn series follows @xmath51 , with @xmath8 and @xmath52 .",
    "when quiet times are added between each point of the original series a region of @xmath45 appears up to a certain time lag . beyond this time lag , @xmath53 as expected since the correlations among the data have not changed . in the spectrum , @xmath44 down to the inverse of the same time lag and then @xmath54 .",
    "this constant @xmath6  and changing @xmath4  is the same effect seen in the sandpile data .",
    "region e is the discharge event region , already well - studied by ref .",
    "@xcite for high drive , and a consequence of the finite system size .",
    "the finite sandpile is always being driven towards a globally critical slope .",
    "once all or almost all cells have slope @xmath55 , a keystone toppling , usually near the bottom , will produce a system - size avalanche or a rapid succession of smaller avalanches that removes enough sand so that the slopes at all sites are reduced to much less than critical ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "once such a large event occurs , it is unlikely that one will happen again for a long time .",
    "hence , large events are anticorrelated and have the signatures of anticorrelated dynamics , @xmath57 in the spectrum and @xmath58 in @xmath5 analysis .",
    "the same process drives both the low and high drive cases .",
    "beyond breakpoint @xmath59 , at the lowest frequencies , the spectrum is flat , which we conjecture to be a reflection of the random drive of the system on the longest time scales .",
    "note that all dynamics is on time scales much smaller than those in this region .",
    "correlations are eventually erased by the system - wide events and shuffled by the random drive at time scales longer than @xmath60 .",
    "region f extends to infinitely low frequencies ; there are no further dynamical regions below it .",
    "we return to figure  [ fig : flipsdifflpowerrs ] to discuss the effect of changing system size .",
    "it is reasonable to increase the level of forcing  practically , the amount of avalanche overlap  in the system by increasing the driving rate @xmath13 .",
    "this means that more grains per time step will fall on the sandpile and triggering time will be reduced .",
    "it turns out that keeping @xmath13  fixed while increasing system size @xmath12  has the same effect because avalanches last longer in the larger system . in both of these cases , @xmath61  has increased , causing trigger time to decrease .",
    "but since system size @xmath12  has remained constant , the ratio of average avalanche duration to trigger time has increased further , producing more overlap and stronger effective forcing .",
    "but the combination @xmath61  does not by itself give enough information about the character of the drive as represented by the amount of avalanche overlap .",
    "imagine increasing @xmath12  while decreasing @xmath13  so that @xmath61  and , therefore , average trigger time remain constant . though trigger time remains constant , the ratio of average avalanche duration to trigger time has again increased because of the increase in system size .",
    "this process , then , also effectively increases the driving rate in the larger system by producing more overlap among the individual avalanches that now last longer .",
    "this is true even though the original and the larger system both have the same @xmath61  and , therefore , the same flux into the whole system and out of the bottom of the sandpile .    in terms of the effective driving rate discussed in section [ sec : model ] , @xmath40  is larger for the larger system when @xmath61  is the same in both .",
    "this feature can be exploited to produce a plot qualitatively similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : merged_all_stretched ] . in that figure ,",
    "the driving rate @xmath61  of the sandpile increases from top to bottom for the spectra shown while system size @xmath12  remains constant .",
    "if instead , one started with the spectrum of a small system at the top of the figure and increased system size while keeping @xmath61  constant , then the _ same figure would be obtained_. in both cases , @xmath62  increases from top to bottom .",
    "an application of this is that perhaps one wants to study a physical system that is suspected of being described by soc and/or the running sandpile . if experimenters can not change the system size ( like , for instance , that of the magnetosphere ) then perhaps periods of different observed driving rates could be used as a proxy for different system sizes .    , one with @xmath63 and one with @xmath64 , using the rescaling law @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the power spectrum and @xmath67 is a scaling function .",
    "different sets of parameters @xmath68 $ ] are needed for each spectrum so this is not the same as , for instance , the multifractal rescaling of avalanche size pdfs of @xcite , where the same value of each parameter is used for different system sizes . ]",
    "since @xmath69 is the correct quantity to use to compare systems in the same drive regime but where the individual parameters are different , this has implications , for example , in investigations of finite size and/or multifractal scaling . as an illustration , fig .",
    "[ fig : pollrescale ] shows justification for comparing systems with the same effective driving rate , in this case with @xmath70 .",
    "the spectra of systems with different driving rates @xmath61  and system sizes @xmath12  but with the same @xmath62  can be rescaled to lie on top of each other .",
    "the spectra of systems with the same driving rate @xmath61but with different system size @xmath12  can not be rescaled to lie on top of each other .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath71 ( dashed line ) , and a shared effective driving rate @xmath72 .",
    "the pdfs have been rescaled by @xmath73 where @xmath74 . ]    finally , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfrescale ] the pdfs of avalanche durations from two different system sizes that have been rescaled by a factor of @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the rescaling has been done for a medium driving rate of @xmath70 so that there is some avalanche overlapping .",
    "this , coupled with the rescaling of the spectra , shows that the running sandpile exhibits critical dynamics similar to that seen in the sandpile with vanishing drive @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the one dimensional directed running sandpile model for five orders of magnitude of driving rate and for almost three orders of magnitude of system size and have shown that the same dynamical correlations that are present in the soc zero - drive limit persist ( and produce nontrivial signatures in the power spectra andwe show through rescaling of power spectra and avalanche size pdfs that the running sandpile exhibits soc in the same way that the vanishing drive sandpile does .",
    "@xmath5 analysis of activity time series ) at finite drives .",
    "our results warn that a time series from _ any _ system , for which soc may provide a plausible description of the dynamics , may be too short to see these correlation signatures and could thus be mistaken for a simple random time series .",
    "we show through rescaling of power spectra and avalanche size pdfs that the running sandpile exhibits soc in the same way that the vanishing drive sandpile does.w    the reason why these correlations persist away from the soc critical point at zero drive can be understood when discussing the physical mechanism through which the sandpile establishes dynamical correlations .",
    "it is well known that memory in the sandpile is retained in the heights ( and , therefore , the local gradients ) of each cell .",
    "this is , for a physical system , the instantaneous system state .",
    "when an avalanche ends , the cells at the endpoints of its active zone are closer to critical and are more likely to be the initiation point of another avalanche .",
    "this is the basis for memory in the system and explains why the drive strength does not affect dynamical correlations , except for pushing them to longer or shorter time scales : _ regardless of how long the intervening quiet time is between two events , they are correlated in the same way .",
    "_ in reference to the introduction , this is how an event can ` know ' how large it will become  it can grow only as large as the size of the local neighborhood of marginal cells .",
    "also , this is why an event of any size _ can not _ simply occur at any time or place in the system .",
    "only the time of the triggering of an event is random due to the random external forcing . before that trigger , though , the size and location of the event is predetermined by the state of the local neighborhood , like an earthquake fault ready to slip .",
    "therefore , the same memory mechanism that is the basis for soc at zero drive is still present in the gradients regardless of how slowly or quickly sand is added , as long as the system is not overdriven .",
    "as we have shown , region d is the only region that reflects the underlying zero - drive soc dynamics at finite drive : _ on the time scales in this region , the spectral and @xmath5  signatures reflect only long time correlations and nothing about pulse shape , quiet times , random superpositions , overlapping of pulses or system size .",
    "_ in fact , in the thermodynamic limit in which the system size becomes increasingly large , we must simultaneously allow @xmath77 to keep @xmath78 constant , which pushes the system to the soc critical point  @xcite . in that case ,",
    "region d would extend to lower and lower frequencies .    finally , another interesting result derived from this work is that the relation @xmath51 derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for fgn series and often accepted as the correct relationship between @xmath4  and @xmath6regardless of the system , does not hold in general .",
    "while this fact is known from general theory  @xcite , the sandpile results provide a concrete example where the relation does not hold .",
    "this implies that the random drive @xmath13  of the system for which @xmath51  _ does hold _ is filtered by the sandpile so that @xmath4and @xmath6  no longer have such a simple relation .",
    "note that the changing @xmath4  and constant @xmath6  of the correlated region d imply that the mechanism that produces @xmath3  at the high drive produces non-@xmath3at lower drive , so that ` @xmath3  is not always @xmath3 ' and smaller values of @xmath4  are not necessarily any less ` special ' than @xmath48 .",
