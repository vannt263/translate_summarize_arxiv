    "due to the wave nature of electrons and the confined geometries in mesoscopic systems , the interplay between interference and interaction becomes one of the central issues in mesoscopic physics .",
    "preservation of quantum coherence in electron transport through an interacting regime has been manifested in the observed kondo effect in semiconductor quantum dot systems@xcite , and more explicitly in the conductance ab oscillation in the interference experiment with a quantum dot embedded in one arm of an aharonov - bohm(ab ) interferometer@xcite .",
    "recently , the fano resonance has attracted much research interest as another important interference effect in mesoscopic systems .",
    "the fano effect was first proposed as a result of the interference between resonant and non - resonant processes in the field of atomic physics@xcite .",
    "it is found to be a ubiquitous phenomenon observed in a large variety of experiments including neutron scattering , atomic photoionization , raman scattering , and optical absorption .",
    "one recent progress is the observation of the fano resonances in condensed matter systems , including an impurity atom on metal surface@xcite , single - electron transistor@xcite , quantum dot in ab interferometer@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show the fano effect , which can be manifested by gate voltage dependence of the linear conductance , is also important for the electron transport through double quantum dots(dqds ) in parallel configuration . for electron tunneling through quantum dots",
    ", it is well known that the strong on - site coulomb interaction leads to the kondo effect at low temperatures , so that the coexistence of the fano resonance with the kondo effect is expected to yield interesting transport phenomena .",
    "electron transport through dqds with series@xcite and parallel@xcite configurations have been realized in experiments , through which studies on the molecular states of the double dots and also the interference effect are carried out .",
    "most of theoretical studies@xcite are devoted to electron transport through dqds connected in series , while relatively little attention is paid for the parallel configuration case especially for the system in the kondo regime@xcite . for the dqd system with a parallel coupling , interference effect should play an important role .",
    "thus , in order to understand the role of the fano effect , it is essential to take into account the coherence of the whole system .",
    "a model of the electron transport through a closed ab interferometer containing two single level quantum dots , which assumes the electrons transport through quantum dots are in full coherence , has been investigated in ref.[15].interesting phenomena such as flux - dependent level attraction and interference induced suppression of conductance have been found .",
    "but the effect of one - site coulomb interaction and the interdot tunneling havent been considered .",
    "ghost fano resonance has also been observed in the study of electron transport through parallel dqds with interdot tunneling but no on - site coulomb interaction@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall investigate electron transport through parallel dqds(schematically plotted in fig.1 ) with interdot tunneling and on - site coulomb interaction using the finite-@xmath0 slave boson mean field theory(sbmft ) approach developed by kotliar and ruckenstein@xcite .",
    "this formulation reproduces the results derived from the well known gutzwiller variation wave function at zero temperature , and therefore is believed to be a powerful tool to study strong correlation effect of electron systems .",
    "the finite - u sbmft has already been applied to investigate electron transport through single quantum dot@xcite , dqds in series in the kondo regime @xcite and persistent current in mesoscopic ring@xcite , and found to give good quantitative results for the kondo effect on the linear conductance .",
    "electron transport through parallel dqds with interdot tunneling and on - site coulomb interation can be described by the following anderson impurity model : @xmath3 where @xmath4 denote annihilation(creation ) operators for electrons in the leads(@xmath5 ) , and @xmath6 those of the single level state in the i - th dot ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "u is the intra - dot coulomb interaction between electrons , @xmath8 is the interdot tunnel coupling , and @xmath9 is the tunnel matrix element between lead @xmath10 and dot @xmath11 .",
    "we consider the symmetric coupling case with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the hybridization strength between the @xmath11-th dot and the lead @xmath10 .    in the finite-@xmath0 slave boson approach@xcite , a set of auxiliary bosons @xmath14 are introduced for each dot , which act as projection operators onto the empty , singly occupied(with spin up and spin down ) , and doubly occupied electron states on the quantum dot , respectively .",
    "the fermion operators @xmath15 are replaced by @xmath16 , with @xmath17 . in order to eliminate unphysical states ,",
    "the following constraint conditions are imposed : @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be rewritten as the following effective hamiltonian in terms of the auxiliary boson @xmath14 and the pesudo - fermion operators @xmath20 : @xmath21 where the constraints are incorporated by the lagrange multipliers @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the first constraint can be interpreted as a completeness relation of the hilbert space in each dot , and the second one equates the two ways of counting the fermion occupancy of a given spin@xcite . in the framework of the finite - u sbmft , the slave boson operators @xmath24 and the parameter @xmath25 are replaced by real c numbers . in this paper , we only consider the spin degenerate case without external magnetic field , so that all parameters are independent of the electron spin .",
    "we can neglect the spin index @xmath26 in the parameters hereafter .",
    "thus in the mean field approximation , the effective hamiltonian is given as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 represents the renormalized tunnel coupling between quantum dots and the renormalized tunnel amplitude between @xmath11-th quantum dot and the lead @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 can be regarded as the wave function renormalization factors in the quantum dots .",
    "@xmath32 is the renormalized dot energy level and @xmath33 $ ] is an energy constant .    within this mean field",
    "effective hamiltonian ( 3 ) the current formula through the dqds is given as@xcite @xmath34t(\\omega)\\;,\\\\\\ ] ] where the transmission probability @xmath35 $ ] , and @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "the retarded / advanced green s functions(gf ) @xmath38 have @xmath39 matrix structures , which account for the double dot structure of the system .",
    "the matrix elements of the retarded gf are defined in time space as @xmath40 . by applying the equation of motion method@xcite",
    ", one can obtain the retarded gf explicitly as @xmath41 the advanced gf is given by @xmath42^\\dagger$ ] . substituting the retarded / advanced gf to the formula of transmission probability , one obtains @xmath43 ^ 2\\over { [ ( \\omega-{\\tilde \\epsilon}_1)(\\omega-{\\tilde \\epsilon}_2)-{\\tilde t_c}^2]^2+[{\\tilde \\gamma}_1(\\omega-{\\tilde \\epsilon}_2)+{\\tilde \\gamma}_2(\\omega-{\\tilde \\epsilon}_1)+2{\\tilde t_c}\\sqrt{{\\tilde\\gamma}_1{\\tilde\\gamma}_2   } ] ^2 } } \\;.\\\\\\ ] ] the conductance @xmath44 at the absolute zero temperature in the limit of zero bias voltage is given by @xmath45 .",
    "it is noticed that the formula for the transmission probability and conductance is equivalent to that of the transport through non - interacting double qd system , except that , in this case , the dot levels @xmath46 , the coupling strength @xmath47 and @xmath48 are renormalized .",
    "therefore , the electron transport through dqds is characterized by the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath49 .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 show strong dependence on the gate voltage applied to the quantum dots , hence the result of linear conductance is quite different from the non - interacting model . in the spin",
    "degenerate case , we have ten unknown parameters @xmath50(i=1,2 ) in total to determine . from the constraints and the equation of motion of the slave boson operators in the effective hamiltonian , we obtain one set of self - consistent equations , which is a straightforward generalized form of the single dot case as discussed in ref.[18 ] . in this set of equations ,",
    "the distribution gf of the quantum dots @xmath51 is involved , and its fourier transform is given by @xmath52g^a(\\omega)$ ] .",
    "we have solved the self - consistent equations numerically .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss the result of our calculation .",
    "first , we consider two identical qds case : @xmath53 and @xmath54 . following eq.(5 )",
    ", the transmission probability in this case has a breit - wigner resonance form , @xmath55 the retarded gf on each dot is also explicitly given as @xmath56\\;.\\\\\\ ] ] the spectral density in the @xmath11-th qd follows from the relation @xmath57 .",
    "it shows that the spectral density is the sum of one lorentizan with the peak position located at @xmath58 and one dirac @xmath59 peak at @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 corresponds to energy of the bonding and the antibonding state of quantum dots , respectively .",
    "the bonding state of dqds has level broadening @xmath63 due to its coupling with the leads .",
    "the @xmath59 peak structure indicates that the antibonding state is totally decoupled from the leads .",
    "therefore the electrons transport only through the channel of the bonding state , which gives a breit - wigner resonance form in the transmission .",
    "in fig.2 we study the effect of interdot tunneling on the transmission probability and the local density of state of qd in the singly occupied regime . here",
    "we take the hybridization strength as the energy unit @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "fig.2(a ) shows that with increasing the interdot coupling @xmath8 , the line shape of breit - wigner resonance of transmission is preserved , while the center of the resonance shifts to higher energy .",
    "thus , the value of transmission probability at zero frequency @xmath66 decreases , which , in turn , results in suppression of the linear conductance at zero bias voltage . for local density of state shown in fig.2(b ) , we see that the antibonding state energy is always nearby the fermi energy of the lead , whereas the center of spectral density contributed from the bonding state shifts to higher energy along with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "the linear conductance @xmath44 as a function of the energy level @xmath67 of the qd at zero temperature is plotted in fig.3(a ) for several values of interdot tunneling @xmath8 . when there is no direct tunneling between two dots ( @xmath68 ) , the conductance reaches the unitary limit(@xmath2 ) in the kondo regime as expected . with increasing tunnel coupling @xmath8 ,",
    "the conductance becomes suppressed and forms a plateau structure in the regime of singly occupied qd state .",
    "when qds cross over to the doubly occupied state regime , the conductance increases to the maximum value @xmath2 .",
    "the line shape of the linear conductance can be explained from the gate voltage dependence of the spectral density and the zero frequency transmission of qd . in fig.3(b ) we plot the bonding state energy @xmath61 , the antibonding state energy @xmath62 and the level broadening @xmath63 as functions of @xmath67 with @xmath69 .",
    "one can see that in the singly occupied regime with decreasing @xmath67 , the antibonding state energy @xmath62 is fixed around the fermi energy of the leads(@xmath70 ) .",
    "it indicates that @xmath71 , and the conductance @xmath72 } \\approx { 1/ ( { \\tilde t_c}^2/{\\tilde\\gamma}^2 + 1)}$ ] . for this identical quantum dot case ,",
    "the value of @xmath73 is given by its bare value @xmath74 .",
    "consequently , the conductance shows a plateau structure and the ratio of @xmath75 determines the height of the conductance plateau .",
    "this is in agreement with the value of conductance at the plateau structure for different @xmath8 as shown in fig.3(a ) . with @xmath67 deceasing further , the qd state crosses over from the singly occupied to the doubly occupied regime , and",
    "@xmath61 goes through from positive value to negative value . at the point , @xmath76",
    ", we obtain the maximum conductance @xmath2 .",
    "further down , the level broadening @xmath77 approaches zero and the dqd will be totally decoupled from the leads , thus the conductance becomes zero .",
    "next , we consider dqd system with different dot levels , @xmath78 , and define @xmath79 and @xmath80 . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we still assume @xmath81 . it is noted that in this case the renormalized hybridization strength @xmath82 . in fig.4",
    "we plot the linear conductance as a function of average energy of the dot levels .",
    "the parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 are used . in the case of dqds without direct tunnel coupling @xmath68 , fig.4(a ) shows that the conductance curve has a narrow dip around the point @xmath85 . from the formula for transmission eq.(6 ) , we note that the conductance vanishes when the condition @xmath86 is satisfied .",
    "the strictly zero transmission is a consequence of destructive quantum interference for electron transport through the parallel dqds , and it is absent for systems with dqds connected in series .",
    "it is interesting to notice that only when the dqds with different energy levels @xmath87 , this characteristic of interference is revealed .",
    "it originates from the fact that , in this case , both the bonding and antibonding state channels are involved in the transmission .",
    "as the energy difference @xmath88 increases , the dip becomes more broadened . for non - zero interdot tunnel couplings as shown in fig.4(b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , the conductance curves have asymmetric line shapes , which are typical for the fano resonance .",
    "this results from the constructive and destructive interference processes for electrons transmitted through the channels of bonding and antibonding states .",
    "it is noted that line broadening of the fano dip or peak depends on the value of dot level difference @xmath88 , which is similar to the non - interacting dqds case@xcite .",
    "the effect of on - site interaction @xmath0 is to introduce strong renormalization of the dot levels and the hybridization strength , hence the center of the fano resonance and line broadening have nonlinear dependence on the interdot tunneling @xmath8 and the level difference @xmath88 .",
    "it is interesting to notice the fano resonances obtained in this study have some similarity with the experiment results in ref.@xcite .",
    "although their experiment is on electron transport through single qd , the coupling strength between quantum dot and the lead is strong and the kondo effect and multilevel of qd might be involved in the electron transport .",
    "recently , b@xmath89sser et al.@xcite have studied the electron transport through multilevel quantum dots using exact - diagonalization techniques .",
    "it is interesting to notice that they have also found conductance dip structure induced by interference effect as shown in fig.4(a ) .",
    "actually , when @xmath68 , the model studied in our paper is equivalent to considering two levels in single quantum dot .    for a dqd system with energy level difference",
    ", the local density of state in @xmath90th qd@xmath91 is given by @xmath92 ^ 2\\over { [ ( \\omega-{\\tilde \\epsilon}_1)(\\omega-{\\tilde \\epsilon}_2)-{\\tilde t_c}^2]^2+[{\\tilde \\gamma}_1(\\omega-{\\tilde \\epsilon}_2)+{\\tilde \\gamma}_2(\\omega-{\\tilde \\epsilon}_1)+2{\\tilde",
    "t_c}\\sqrt{{\\tilde\\gamma}_1{\\tilde\\gamma}_2   } ] ^2 } } \\;.\\\\\\ ] ] in fig.5 . we plot the local density of state in each dot .",
    "the line shape of density of state can be regarded as a superposition of a fano line shape close to the antibonding state energy and a breit - wigner resonance around the bonding state energy(see ref.[16 ] for detail discussion ) .",
    "the interference effect on the local density of state is manifested clearly as compared with that in fig.2(b ) .",
    "in summary , we have studied the electron transport through dqds in parallel configuration with interdot tunneling in the kondo regime . the strong coulomb repulsion in the dots",
    "is taken into account via the finite-@xmath0 slave boson technique .",
    "the results of our calculation indicate several distinct features from the non - interacting model@xcite : the conductance shows plateau structure as a function of the dot level in the singly occupied regime ; without interdot tunneling @xmath68 , there is dip structure on the conductance plateau when the energy levels of two dots are different .",
    "when @xmath93 , the conductance has fano resonance line shape on the conductance plateau as a function of the averaged dot level ; the energies of the bonding and antibonding states and the level broadening of the bonding state are strongly renormalized compared to the noninteracting model case .",
    "for instance , the antibonding state energy is almost fixed around the fermi energy of the lead in the singly occupied region .",
    "the results are also different from that of the dqds in series , in which the maximum conductance is achieved when the interdot tunneling @xmath94 and no fano resonance is observed@xcite .",
    "the fano effect for parallel dqds originates from the interference effect for electron transport through the two channels of bonding and antibonding states of parallel dqds .",
    "in one recent experiment , chen et al.@xcite have studied the kondo effect in parallel dqds system .",
    "but the maximum conductance obtained in their experiment is only about @xmath95 by varying the gate voltage and interdot tunneling , so that we think the full coherent electron transport through dqds is nt achieved and the interference effect is not manifested .",
    "one may expect further experiments on the parallel dqds system can observe the conductance plateau structure and also the fano resonance as discussed above .",
