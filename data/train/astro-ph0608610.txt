    "clusters of galaxies have been extensively studied in all available wave bands .",
    "they belong to the most massive and eye - catching structures in the universe and are thought to closely resemble the cosmic composite of 85 per cent dark matter and 15 per cent baryonic matter @xcite . according to the hierarchical model for structure assembly , these systems preferentially have formed late . for dark matter haloes it has been shown that the formation redshift is correlated with concentration ( e.g.  @xcite ) therefore clusters present a class of low concentration objects .",
    "in contrast , groups of galaxies span a whole range of formation times and concentrations . some resemble the properties of clusters @xcite , having low concentrations , others show an opposite behaviour .    also the properties of the galaxy populations vary strongly amongst individual groups .",
    "some groups have luminosity functions similar to those observed in clusters but fossil groups display a central giant elliptical galaxy with only few intermediate - luminosity galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the optical properties of the central bright galaxies are consistent with an origin as the merged combination of a more typical , less over - luminous , galaxies . the variations amongst the satellite populations are thought to originate from varying formation times .",
    "using n - body experiments @xcite demonstrated that the earliest formed group - sized dark matter haloes reveal structural similarity to observed fossil groups ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the early formation times of fossil groups also impacts satellite galaxies that do not merge with the central giant . based on the observed depletion of intermediate - luminosity galaxies in the fossil group rx j1552.2 + 2013",
    ", @xcite suggests that the members of this system may be affected by tidal disruption .",
    "@xcite find substantial amount of intra - group light in two of three compact groups which may , at least partly , come from tidally dissolved satellite galaxies .",
    "these observations indicate a substantial variation of the satellite population with time either by merging or by tidal dissolution .",
    "in addition to the concentration - age and the luminosity - age relations , we describe here a concentration - velocity relation . according to the jeans equation , galaxies orbiting in more concentrated host haloes have higher velocity dispersions .",
    "this effect is most pronounced in the central regions of the host haloe . as discussed above ,",
    "early formed groups are more concentrated , leading to the conclusion that the central satellite galaxies in fossil groups move faster than central galaxies in less evolved groups of comparable size .",
    "additionally , if tidal disruption reduces the number of satellite galaxies , the velocity dispersion of the remaining galaxies is expected to increase even higher .",
    "the last statement is supported by the following consideration .",
    "analysing n - body simulations , @xcite find an enhanced velocity dispersion of subhaloes compared to the dispersion of the diffuse dark matter component .",
    "subsequently , @xcite argued that the loss of a slow moving , earlier accreted , subset of the subhaloe population is responsible for this bias . in analogy , if satellite galaxies are prone to tidal dissolution , then early accreted , slow moving , galaxies are preferentially dissolved .",
    "the lack of low velocity galaxies causes an enhanced velocity dispersion of the remaining galaxies .",
    "an observational hint for such a scenario may be the recent observation of the fossil system rx j1416.4 + 2315 by @xcite . based on 18 member galaxies they find a velocity dispersion that is nearly twice as high as expected from the x - ray analysis of this system .",
    "these findings motivated us to study the relation between the host concentration and dynamics of the subhaloe populations .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . ",
    "[ sec : model ] introduces the dynamical model used to trace the evolution of substructure in host haloes of different mass accretion histories . ",
    "[ sec : point ] deals with substructure as point - like particles , a reference for the subsequent more complex investigation .",
    "  [ sec : subhaloe ] presents dynamical results when substructures are treated as extended units prone to tidal stripping and dynamical friction . finally , ",
    "[ sec : summary ] concludes with a summary .",
    "we aim to investigate the correlation between the host concentration and subhaloe dynamics . in principle",
    "cosmological n - body simulations can best tackle these kinds of problems .",
    "however , such simulations should cover a large volume for satisfactory host haloe statistics and , at the same time , provide high resolution for the accurate determination of the subhaloe dynamics .",
    "here we pursue an alternative approach .",
    "we employ semi - analytical models to gain a basic understanding of the processes which shape the subhaloe distributions within equal mass hosts of various concentrations .    in recent years high resolution cdm simulations",
    "have substantially improved our understanding of cosmic structure formation .",
    "this insight can be used to model the dynamical evolution of subhaloe in a semi - analytical manner .",
    "recently , @xcite demonstrated that this kind of semi - analytical modelling achieves good agreement with state of the art n - body simulations .",
    "similar approaches have been used for a variety of scientific goals ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    here",
    "we extend the models presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "originally , these models were designed to reproduce the well observed number density distribution of satellite galaxies of the ngc 5044 group .",
    "these models have been modified for the purposes of present investigation .",
    "basically , the model integrates the orbits of subhaloes from the accretion onto the host to the present ( @xmath1 ) within the deepening gravitational potential of the host haloe . by means of this the origin of the present subhaloe distribution can be investigated .",
    "also , the code allows us to assign a mass profile to the entering subhaloes which in turn can be used to compute the modification of their orbits by tidal mass loss and dynamical friction .",
    "based on the analysis of n - body simulations @xcite found that the mass growth of cdm haloes can be described by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the cosmic expansion factor at the formation redshift @xmath11 .",
    "given the present virial mass of a haloe , the mass accretion history is fully determined by the only remaining free parameter @xmath12 .",
    "individual accretion histories may differ strongly from this description , but on average the mass accretion is well approximated by this formula .",
    "most importantly , the mass built - up of a haloe is separated into two distinct phases , namely an early rapid accretion phase and a subsequent period of modest accretion .",
    "knowing @xmath13 also allows to compute the evolution of the virial radius @xmath14 . according to the spherical collapse model the virial radius @xmath14 is the radius which includes a mean density of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the virial over - density in units of the critical density @xmath17 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . @xmath18",
    "anticipating an nfw density profile @xcite , the host mass and concentration are sufficient to completely determine its properties . according to @xcite the evolution of the concentration is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 according to @xcite and @xmath21 , the cosmic expansion factor at the time of observation , equals 1 in this context . in our model eqs .",
    "[ equ : evoma ] and  [ equ : evoco ] completely characterise the growth of the host and its gravitational potential which in turn determines the orbits of the subhaloes . at @xmath1",
    "all host haloes approach the same virial mass ( @xmath22 ) , but they exhibit concentrations in the range between 2 and 20 ( integer steps , resulting in 19 output sets ) .",
    "the low concentration haloes are currently in the rapid accretion phase . according to eq .",
    "[ equ : evoco ] the formation of the least concentrated haloes takes place in future times .",
    "the most concentrated haloes formed at redshifts @xmath23 .",
    "the evolution of the host haloe as described here does not explicitly include merging events .",
    "such events may rearrange the phase space distributions of the subhaloes .",
    "however , the rapid accretion phase at early times causes the fastest change of the potential over the whole accretion history of a haloe . to a certain extent",
    "these violent merging processes are covered by the steep slope of the accretion ( equation  [ equ : evoma ] ) at @xmath11 .    in summary ,",
    "the mass growth of the host haloes modelled according to eq .",
    "[ equ : evoma ] provides the background potential for the dynamical evolution of the subhaloes .",
    "all hosts have a mass of @xmath22 at @xmath1 and concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 ( integer steps ) . according to eq.[equ : evoco ] concentrations",
    "are associated with formation times , resulting in different accretion histories for the host haloes despite their equal masses .      after introducing the model for the host we now descirbe the host s substructure population .",
    "two samples of 100000 orbits are traced for every host haloe .",
    "the first sample , referred to as the _ point mass sample _ , follows the evolution of point - like particles within the potential of the host . in the second sample ,",
    "dubbed the _ subhaloe sample _ , the orbits are modified by the effects of tidal stripping and dynamical friction which involve the attribution of density profiles to each substructure .",
    "the point mass sample is mainly used to test the agreement of the model with n - body simulations on a particle basis .",
    "the subhaloes in the subhaloe sample have masses @xmath24 which renders them possible candidates for hosting galaxies . obviously , the sum of all 100000 subhaloe masses exceeds the mass of the host haloe .",
    "therefore , the results for the subhaloe distributions should be considered as the outcome of stacking many identical groups . in the next two paragraphs",
    "we describe the generation of the initial conditions and initial properties of the subhaloes in the subhaloe sample .",
    "we assume that the initial space density of the subhaloes is proportional to the dark matter , i.e. subhaloes enter the host haloe in proportion to the dark matter . to generate this particular accretion pattern the individual arrival times of the subhaloes",
    "are assigned by a random process using the mass of the host as a proxy for the cosmic time .",
    "@xmath25 here @xmath26 is a random number and @xmath27 the virial mass of the host at @xmath1 . by setting @xmath28 ( eq .  [ equ : evoma ] ) @xmath29 can be converted into the cosmic expansion factor @xmath30 or equivalently @xmath31 , which is considered as the accretion time of the @xmath32 subhaloe .",
    "subsequently eq .  [ equ : evorv ] is used to derive virial radius of the host , @xmath33 , at that time .",
    "the @xmath32 subhaloe is assumed to be gravitationally accelerated by @xmath29 from standstill at the turnaround radius ( @xmath34 ) until it reaches the virial radius , @xmath33 .",
    "the resulting absolute values of the velocity at @xmath33 is @xmath35 which also equals the circular velocity at @xmath33 . to assign an angular momentum to each subhaloe",
    "we invoke another random process designed to reproduce the distribution of circularities found in n - body simulations .",
    "the circularity is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the angular momentum of the orbit and and @xmath38 is the angular momentum of a circular orbit with the same orbital energy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite present the orbital circularity distribution for subhaloes in n - body simulations at the time of entering the virial radius of the host .",
    "they also provide a fitting formula for the distribution and state that it is independent of accretion redshift and subhaloe mass .",
    "here we model the probability distribution of circularities with a simple quadratic , @xmath39 , which is in fairly good agreement with the data presented by @xcite and has a mean circularity of @xmath40 .",
    "the initial angular momentum of a subhaloe is randomly drawn from this distribution , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a random number between zero and one .",
    "note , the distributions of circularities were derived for subhaloes in n - body simulations , here we implicitly assume that the same regularity holds for the point mass sample as well .    knowing the evolution of the host potential , the accretion time and the initial orbital parameters of each subhaloe , the integration of the orbits can be pursued .",
    "details about the integration are presented at the end of the following paragraph .",
    "two random processes are involved to generate the orbital initial conditions , namely @xmath43 for the arrival time and @xmath42 for the initial angular momentum .",
    "we assume , that the orbital energy is uniquely determined by the host virial mass and radius at the time of arrival , which may not be exactly the case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , for simplicity we do not implement an additional mechanism to spread the distribution of initial orbital energies .",
    "as long as the subhaloes are treated as point - like particles and dynamical friction is ignored , the orbits are independent of the subhaloe masses . for a more realistic model we must consider the spatial extension of the subhaloes and as a consequence the susceptibility to tidal truncation .",
    "for that purpose a mass is attributed to every arriving subhaloe by a random process which is set up to to generate a power law mass function as observed for the field haloes in n - body simulations .",
    "we adopt @xmath44 where @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the mass of the @xmath32 haloe @xmath46 at arrival is given by @xmath47^{1/x}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a random number between 0 and 1 , @xmath49 .",
    "the lower mass limit is @xmath50 and the upper mass limit is @xmath51 , where @xmath29 is the current host mass ( see eq.[equ : mira ] ) .",
    "we only focus on the evolution of dark matter haloes above @xmath50 because they are massive enough to potentially host visible galaxies .",
    "the upper mass limit is chosen to avoid merging of haloes more massive than the current host .",
    "note , since the mass function is so steep our results do not depend on the exact choice of the upper mass limit .",
    "this restriction assures that we follow the host merging tree along the most massive progenitors . ignoring the possible deviations caused by the centrally condensed baryonic matter , we associate an nfw density profile @xcite to every arriving subhaloe .",
    "we assume that the formation redshift of all ( sub)haloes is @xmath52 ( which corresponds to @xmath53 ) . by setting the arrival time @xmath54 in eq .",
    "[ equ : evoco ] the concentration @xmath55 of the subhaloe is computed . the density profile of the subhaloe is completely determined by @xmath46 and @xmath55 .",
    "we assume that on the subsequent orbits the shape of the density profile does not change ( see @xcite ) however it can be truncated due to tidal forces .",
    "the tidal truncation radius is estimated by the jacobi limit ( see @xcite ) , @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the instantaneous distance of the subhaloe from the centre of the host , @xmath58 is the host mass within @xmath57 and @xmath59 is the current mass of the subhaloe .",
    "if @xmath60 is smaller than the current radius of the subhaloe , all the matter outside of @xmath60 is assumed to be stripped instantaneously and the current haloe radius is replaced within @xmath60 .",
    "the orbits of the subhaloes are found by solving @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the nfw mass within radius @xmath63 of the host .",
    "orbits are computed from redshift @xmath31 ( redshift at arrival ) to the present epoch , @xmath1 .",
    "for the integration we use a fourth order runge - kutta integration scheme with adaptive time stepping .",
    "the deceleration by dynamical friction ( @xcite ) is described by @xmath64\\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath65 is the local density of the host haloe , @xmath66 is the velocity of the subhaloe , @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the mean velocity dispersion of diffuse dark matter in the host halo .",
    "we assume that the total dispersion can be approximated by the cold dark matter dispersion presented by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we choose @xmath69 as suggested by @xcite which is the point mass approximation .",
    "this approximation is justified by the very efficient tidal mass stripping which rapidly truncates the radius of the subhaloe to a few per cent of the virial radius of the host .    in summary ,",
    "a mass is randomly assigned to each arriving subhaloe .",
    "the random process is designed to recover the mass functions of field haloes found in n - body simulations .",
    "additionally a concentration is assigned to the subhaloe assuming a common ( sub)haloe formation redshift of @xmath70 .",
    "based on mass and concentration an nfw density profiles is associated with each subhaloe .",
    "the profile is assumed to maintain its shape on the subsequent orbit within the host potential well , however tidal truncation is allowed to take place .",
    "the subhaloe gets most severely truncated at its peri - centre passage .",
    "the remaining mass remains constant until the subhaloe approaches the centre for the next time .",
    "between two subsequent peri - centre passages the subhaloe loses some orbital energy due to dynamical friction , the peri - centre distance shrinks with each passage , reducing the truncation radius .",
    "of course , lower masses experience less dynamical friction .",
    "the mass of the subhaloes decreases in a step - like fashion , as also observed in n - body simulations ( e.g.@xcite ) .    in order to investigate",
    "how tidal reduction affects the properties of the subhaloe population we will construct a sub - subhaloe sample containing only subhaloes having present truncation radii above the _ rejection _ radius @xmath71 .",
    "this choice is somewhat arbitrary , but in agreement with values given in @xcite who achieve good agreement between the outcome of a very similar dynamical model for the observed galaxy group ngc 5044 .",
    "subsequently , we refer to the two subsamples as then _ complete _ and _ reduced _ samples , emphasising that the latter is a subset of the former .",
    "note , disappearance when @xmath72 in the reduced subhaloe sample does not necessarily mean total physical disassembly of the object , it may just mean that it falls below a given detection limit .",
    "such limits are apparent in both simulations and observations . the detection of subhaloes in simulations is constricted by a minimum particle number limit for substructures and the detection of satellite galaxies in groups depends on the sensitivity of the observations .",
    "the point mass sample follows the evolution of point - like particles within the growing potential well of equal - mass host haloes with varying accretion histories .",
    "mass dependent mechanisms , like tides and dynamical friction , are excluded .",
    "the mass of the particles is irrelevant . in this section",
    "we ( 1 ) demonstrate the agreement of the model with established results from n - body simulations and ( 2 ) discuss the concentration - sigma relation for this simplified approach as a reference for the results for the ( complete and reduced ) subhaloe samples presented in the following section .",
    "the particles , or later subhaloes , enter the host haloe in proportion to the dark matter .",
    "the growth of the dark matter host haloe is described by eq .",
    "[ equ : evoma ] .",
    "the generation of the initial condition for each particle includes two random selections , the arrival time and the initial angular momentum .",
    "after the first penetration of the host virial radius the orbits are integrated numerically .",
    "[ fig : radac ] displays the expansion factor at accretion time versus the current particle distance from the centre the host , showing distributions for host concentrations of 6 , 10 and 20 .",
    "subsequently , whenever properties of individual hosts shall be exemplified we use these tree concentrations and refer to the accordingly , as the @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 hosts . despite the angular momentum distribution imposed on the particles , caustic - like features are apparent as discussed in the context of the secondary infall model by @xcite .",
    "the most prominent feature is caused by the _ caustic of the second turnaround _ generated by the particles when they reach the apo - centre after their first peri - centre passage .",
    "investigating the dynamics of the ngc 5846 group @xcite find observational support for the appearance of the caustic of the second turnaround .",
    "the location of the second caustic is correlated with the host concentration . for the @xmath73 host",
    "the caustic is located at the virial radius whereas in the @xmath75 host it is found at @xmath76 times the virial radius . for all host concentrations ,",
    "the second turnaround is experienced by particles accreted at @xmath77 .",
    "[ fig : masachi ] compares the mass growth of the host haloe ( thin solid lines ) to the particle accretion history for all particles located within the host virial radius at @xmath1 ( three heavier lines )",
    ". both quantities , host mass and particle numbers , are normalised to unity .",
    "the deviations at late times are caused by particles with orbits currently beyond the virial radius also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : radac ] .    the positive correlation between the group - centric distances of the caustics and the concentrations in fig .",
    "[ fig : radac ] arises from the more rapid mass assembly of high concentration hosts .",
    "the thin solid lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : masachi ] indicate that at @xmath78 . the @xmath75 host has already assembled 90 per cent of the final mass compared to only 60 per cent for the @xmath73 host .",
    "thus at the time ( @xmath79 ) when the particles are accreted that presently pass through the second turnaround the @xmath75 host is a factor of 1.5 more massive than the @xmath73 host .",
    "therefore its virial radius is larger by a factor of @xmath80 .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : radac ] shows a factor of @xmath76 difference between the location of the @xmath75 and the @xmath73 turnaround .",
    "this additional shrinking of the second turnaround radius within the less concentrated host is caused by the rapid mass growth of the @xmath73 host at the present time .",
    "thus particles moving outward after their first peri - centre passage feel a much deeper potential well , which prevents them from reaching their original starting point , the first turnaround when they decouple from cosmic expansion .",
    "in contrast , the highly concentrated hosts do nt show such a rapid deepening of its potential at late times , so the particles can move further out .",
    "the host mass grows according to eq .",
    "[ equ : evoma ] and the evolution of the concentration is given by eq .",
    "[ equ : evoco ] . the rate that particles ( the same applies to subhaloes ) enter the virial radius of the host",
    "is given by eq .",
    "[ equ : mafu ] .",
    "about half of all the particles are accreted onto the host before @xmath81 .",
    "of course this value varies depending on the accretion histories which in our model are determined by the current concentration of the host .",
    "[ fig : profil ] compares the number density profiles for the three concentrations ( @xmath82 ) with nfw - profiles .",
    "the agreement of the analytical profiles with the results of the dynamical evolution is remarkable .",
    "the successful reproduction of the analytical profile by the dynamically evolved particle distribution provides strong evidence for the capability of the present model .",
    "there appear small deviations at the centre for the more concentrated hosts which may be caused by a lack of numerical resolution or by a slight inaccuracy of the employed accretion formula at early times ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this occurs only within a few per cent of the virial radius and will not affect the results presented here .",
    "we now focus on the velocity profiles of the point mass sample .",
    "in particular we derive a general expression for the anisotropy parameter @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the radial velocity dispersion and @xmath85 is the uni - dimensional tangential velocity dispersion . if the tangential velocities are isotropic @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the two dimensional tangential velocity dispersion . by scaling the host - centric distances by @xmath7 , the characteristic radius of the nfw - profiles , one achieves coincidence of the @xmath88-profiles independent of the concentration .",
    "the upper panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : ravel ] display the radial mean velocities and the velocity dispersions of the particles for the three example hosts ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "negative values in the fist panel indicate net infall . for the more concentrated hosts the radial velocities are close to zero , indicating fairly relaxed systems .",
    "the particles within the @xmath73 host show some slight net infall at @xmath90 which my be a result of the recent rapid growth phase of the host haloe .",
    "the velocity dispersions in the second panel show a behaviour known from n - body simulations @xcite , they peak at about @xmath91 . in the third panel",
    "the velocity dispersions are split up into radial and tangential components . to allow for a direct comparison with the radial component the uni - dimensional tangential velocity dispersion @xmath85",
    "is shown here .",
    "finally , the anisotropy profiles @xmath92 for the three host haloes are given in the lowest panel . despite the different host concentrations , we find that the anisotropy profiles are very similar if the distances scaled by the characteristic radius @xmath7 of the nfw - profile rather than the virial radius @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath88-profiles can be fit with an concentration - independent expression : @xmath94 this expression enables an analytical integration of the jeans equations as discussed in the appendix .",
    "in addition to the successful reproduction of the density profiles the present inspection of the velocity profiles confirms that the dynamical properties of our model are also in good agreement with the dynamical characteristics of cdm haloes generated by n - body experiments .",
    "based on 10 relaxed dark matter halos @xcite find a similar shape and asymptotic values for the average @xmath88-profile .",
    "also the @xmath88-profiles based on six highly resolved n - body systems presented by @xcite ( based on simulations discussed in @xcite and @xcite ) show very similar features .",
    "finally , the density slope - velocity anisotropy relation discussed in @xcite implies a self similarity of @xmath88-profiles when scaled by @xmath7 as advocated here .",
    "we now investigate the relation between the mean particle velocity dispersion and the concentration of the host haloes .",
    "it is expected that the velocity dispersion increases with concentration , therefore the present results should be considered as an further affirmation of the model and a point of reference for subsequent investigations of the subhaloes sample .",
    "[ fig : fvir ] shows the dependence of the mean particle velocity dispersions on the host concentrations .",

    "[ equ : beta ] to describe the radial behaviour of the anisotropy parameter .",
    "details of this integration can be found in the appendix .",
    "the agreement between the model and the analytical computation is convincing .",
    "for very small concentrations @xmath95 some deviations appear , but hosts haloes with these small concentrations are in the process of formation and the applicability of the jeans equation in this form may be questioned .",
    "the @xmath3 per cent deviation for the mean dispersion within the full virial radius @xmath96 probably results from the orderly accretion mode inherent in our model .",
    "its traces are certainly not blurred out before the second turnaround passage ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : radac ] ) .",
    "the main finding is that the velocity dispersion for hosts with concentrations @xmath4 are a factor of @xmath97 higher then the mean velocity dispersions of equal mass hosts with concentrations @xmath3 .",
    "the mean central velocity dispersions increase somewhat stronger with the host concentration than those within larger radii .    in summary ,",
    "our comprehensive examinations of the point mass sample have shown satisfactory agreement with the results from n - body simulations , indicating that our simplified dynamical model can reproduce the main characteristics found by more elaborate n - body simulations . however , we notice that the outskirts ( @xmath98 ) may be slightly affected by the unphysical regularity of the accretion mode .",
    "nevertheless , the model enables us to measure in detail the dependence of the subhaloe properties on the host concentration .",
    "this section describes the dynamical evolution of extended subhaloes within the growing potentials of their hosts . as described in ",
    "[ sec : subprop ] we attribute to every ( sub)haloe a nfw - density profile and include the effects of dynamical friction and tidal truncation in the integration of the orbits . for every host",
    "we distinguish two subhaloe samples at @xmath1 , a _",
    "complete _ sample and a _ tidally reduced _ sample .",
    "the former comprises all 100000 subhaloes independently of their present truncation radius and the latter counts only those subhaloes whose tidal truncation radius is larger then @xmath6 .",
    "the tidally reduced sample is a sub - sample of the complete sample .",
    "for example , the reduced samples of the @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 host haloes comprise a number of 74777 , 57218 , 36258 surviving subhaloes , respectively , of the original 100000 within the complete sample .",
    "the idea behind this distinction is to imitate the effects of detection limits which are inherent to observation and simulations .",
    "if satellite galaxies fall below a certain luminosity , they wo nt appear in the catalogue . and if subhaloes fall below a certain particle limit they wo nt be counted as substructure . in both cases",
    "the disappearance from the catalogue does not necessarily mean total physical disassembly .",
    "the accretion times and the assembly history of the subhaloes samples do not differ from those plotted in figs .",

    "consequently , we start the investigation of the subhaloe samples with the discussion of the evolution of the mass function .      the assignment of initial subhaloe masses is designed to reproduce a differential mass distribution @xmath99 with a power law shape and a logarithmic slope of @xmath45 , the appropriate slope for field haloes measured in n - body simulations .",

    "[ fig : maha ] compares the differential mass functions of the arriving subhaloes ( thin lines ) with the mass function of the complete subhaloes at @xmath1 after they were dynamically processed within the three example hosts ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) .",
    "the mass functions are shown within a range of @xmath103 .",

    "the reason for the weak dependence on host concentration can be explained by the correlation between mean subhaloe accretion times and host concentrations as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mzac ] . on average subhaloes in more concentrated hosts",
    "are accreted earlier , thus they are exposed to the tidal field of the host for a longer time and they suffer more severe mass losses .",
    "the thick lines in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : maha ] may clarify this issue .",
    "they display the ratios of initial to the final subhaloe mass function .",
    "the @xmath73 host exhibits a difference in amplitude of a factor of @xmath104 , whereas in the @xmath75 host the final mass function is reduced by a factor of @xmath105 .",
    "the thin lines in the lower panel display the ratios between the initial and the final mass distributions in the tidally reduced subhaloe sample . at the low mass end",
    "the difference between initial and final mass function is enhanced , however the high mass end shows barely any difference .",
    "therefore , at the low mass end the power law slope is conserved even in the tidally reduced sample . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : mzac ] displays the mean accretion times as a function of host concentration for the tidally reduced sample .",
    "in particular for concentrations @xmath4 the difference of the mean accretion time is about @xmath106 .",
    "[ fig : provir ] shows the number density profiles for the complete and the tidally reduced subhaloe samples within the three host haloes with present concentrations of 6 , 10 and 20 . in contrast to the density profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : profil ] the distances from the centre of the host are scaled by the virial radius @xmath93 .",
    "for comparison the associated nfw - profiles are displayed with thin solid lines .",
    "similar to findings for the point mass sample in ",
    "[ sec : density1 ] , the agreement between the nfw - profile and the complete sample is remarkable , indicating that the combined action of dynamical friction and tidal truncation does not severely alter the number density profile .",
    "subhaloes lose a substantial fraction of their mass during their first peri - centre passage , after that the dynamical friction is strongly reduced since dynamical friction drag is proportional to the subhaloe mass ( eq .  [ equ : chan ] ) .",
    "the number densities of all tidally reduced samples show a centrally flattened behaviour , indeed at the very centre they display positive gradients .",
    "we do not discuss to what extent these positive gradients are physical since the presence of baryons in subhaloes certainly alters their tidal resistance .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that most of tidal reduction within the @xmath73 host is confined to the volume within half the virial radius whereas the tidal reduction is visible over the whole haloe volume in the case of the @xmath75 host .",
    "some very interesting insights into the dynamics of subhaloes can be gained by comparisons of the velocity distributions for the complete and the tidally reduced samples displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : ravel_dftrm ] and [ fig : rupel_dftrm ] respectively .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the tidally reduced sample is a subsample of the complete sample .",
    "therefore , higher mean velocities in the reduced sample can only be achieved if preferentially slow moving haloes are removed .",
    "in other words there is no source of high velocity haloes in the reduced sample .",
    "the uppermost panel in fig .  [ fig : ravel_dftrm ] displays the mean radial velocity of the complete sample . with exception of the outskirts they are close to zero , indicating a relaxed state . on the other side",
    "the mean velocities of the tidally reduced samples ( fig .  [",
    "fig : rupel_dftrm ] ) show a clear trend for inward motion , negative @xmath107 .",
    "this is most naturally explained by tidal shrinkage as subhaloes first approach the host centre .",
    "consequently , most probably the truncation radii falls below the rejection radius of @xmath6 close to the peri - centre passage of the subhaloe , resulting in a lack of outward streaming subhaloes in the reduced sample . for large radii",
    "the velocity dispersions of the two samples are similar ( second panels in figs .",
    "[ fig : ravel_dftrm ] and [ fig : rupel_dftrm ] ) .",
    "however , the central velocity dispersions of the reduced sample are @xmath76 times larger than in the complete sample .",
    "again this increase of the velocity dispersion can only be explained by the lack of preferentially slow moving subhaloes .",
    "the comparison of the orthogonal components of the velocity dispersions ( third panel in figs .",
    "[ fig : ravel_dftrm ] and [ fig : rupel_dftrm ] ) indicates that the increase of the central velocity dispersion in the reduced sample is based on the strong enhancement of the tangential dispersions , which again must arise due to a lack of slow tangential motions .",
    "the radial components give the reverse picture .",
    "the central radial velocity dispersion of the reduced sample is actually smaller , indicating a deficit of fast radially moving subhaloes compared to the complete sample .",
    "a hint for this mechanism was reported by @xcite investigating the velocity distribution of galaxies in hydro - dynamical simulations of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the resulting anisotropy profiles are quite different ( note the different scaling in the lowest panels of figs .  [",
    "fig : ravel_dftrm ] and [ fig : rupel_dftrm ] ) . if one assumes similar processes operating for satellite galaxy populations in simulated groups , the negative values for @xmath88 displayed in @xcite ( their fig .",
    "5 ) are in agreement with the findings presented here .",
    "@xcite discussed the enhanced survival rate of subhaloes with condensed baryonic cores . in theory the behaviour of the velocity distribution of satellite galaxies in groups can be used to determine their tidal disruption rate .      in analogy to fig.[fig :",
    "fvir ] we display in fig.[fig : rup2 ] the mean dispersions within 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 and 1 times the virial radius @xmath93 for the complete and the tidally reduced subhaloe samples .",
    "the larger dispersions always correspond to the tidally reduced sample whereas the lower line of each pair refers to the complete sample .",
    "the dispersions of the point mass sample in fig.[fig : fvir ] are quite similar to the values of the complete sample , indicating only a weak impact of dynamical friction on the global properties of the subhaloe population .",
    "however , the impact of tidal reduction is enormous for the central dispersions , e.g. for host concentrations of @xmath4 the velocity dispersions within @xmath108 are enhanced by a factor of @xmath109 compared to the complete sample .",
    "the dependence on concentration within the tidally reduced sample is also more prominent , the central dispersion in hosts with concentration @xmath3 to hosts with concentration @xmath4 increases by a factor @xmath110 .",
    "the mean dispersion within the virial radius is only weakly affected by the tidal reduction .    since the complete sample resembles the behaviour of the point mass sample , the jeans equation holds also in this case .",
    "due to the negative mean radial velocities in the reduced sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rup2 ] ) one of the preconditions for the description by the jeans equation is no longer valid ( see appendix ) .",
    "we do not aim to present a modified solution which can cope with radial motions , because the extent of inflow depends on the choice of the rejection radius in our model .",
    "the important result here is that an increase in central velocity dispersion of satellite galaxies in groups caused by higher concentration may be amplified if some fraction of the satellite population has been tidally disrupted .",
    "both trends are in the same direction .",
    "low concentration hosts have relatively low central velocity dispersions and their recent formation times make tidal disruption as a driver for an enhanced velocity dispersions unlikely .",
    "strongly concentrated hosts have higher velocity dispersions and accreted most of their satellites early on .",
    "this old population may be more severely reduced by tidal forces , causing an additional boost to the central velocity dispersion .",
    "using a dynamical model for the evolution of subhaloes within a growing host potential in galaxy groups , we have investigated the relation between host concentration and properties of subhaloe population at @xmath1 .",
    "the concentration is correlated with the group formation redshift .",
    "groups with equal virial masses at @xmath1 but different formation times show significant differences in their subhaloe properties . as a base point",
    "we have computed the dynamical evolution of point mass samples and their dependence on the host concentration .",
    "the model then has been adapted to cope with the spatial extent of subhaloes and the impact of dynamical friction and tidal disruption .",
    "we only focus on the dynamical evolution of subhaloes that are massive enough to possibly host galaxies .",
    "every substructure analysis is subject to detection limits whether it is the sensitivity limit in connection with observations or the resolution limit in numerical simulations . to study the effects of detection limits , we create a _ reduced _ subhaloe sample comprising only those subhaloes with current radii larger than a rejection radius of @xmath111 .",
    "the reduced sample is a sub - sample of the _ complete _ sample , comprising all subhaloes independent of the actual truncation radius .",
    "the rejection radius can be considered as a parameter of the model and has been calibrated by observations as well as numerical simulations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "originally the model is set up to trace the evolution of the dark matter subhaloes in a group environment , however if the subhaloes host luminous galaxies , a tidal truncation below @xmath6 most probably would affect the stellar component of the galaxy as well .",
    "our main findings are : ( 1 ) the velocity dispersion of subhaloes or satellite galaxies in groups depends on the concentration of the underlying dark matter distribution of the host haloe .",
    "equal mass hosts with higher concentrations have enhanced velocity dispersions of the subhaloes , in particular at the centre .",
    "since higher host concentrations are caused by earlier formation times , this relation implies that subhaloe populations with early formed hosts exhibit higher velocity dispersions than those residing in more recently formed hosts of equal mass .",
    "( 2 ) we propose a fitting formula for the radial dependence of the anisotropy parameter @xmath88 , which is independent of concentration if the group - centric distances when scaled by the characteristic radius of the nfw - profile @xmath7 .",
    "( 3 ) the increase of the central velocity dispersion with concentration is amplified in the reduced sample .",
    "this is caused by an enhancement of the tangential velocity dispersion and a lack of slow radial motions compared to the complete sample .",
    "( 4 ) the dynamical evolution of subhaloes that experience tidal stripping and dynamical friction does not alter the slope of the mass function , in agreement with the results from n - body simulations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but dynamical evolution reduces the amplitude by a factor of @xmath104 . in the complete sample",
    "the amplitude of the mass function is only weakly dependent upon the host concentration .",
    "however , the reduced sample shows a stronger dependence on host concentration with amplitudes decreasing with increasing host concentrations . for a host concentration of 20 the amplitude of the initial",
    "mass function decreases by a factor of @xmath3 , however this value depends strongly on the choice of the rejection radius .",
    "the present investigation reveals the difficulties associated with mass estimates derived from the velocity dispersion of satellites in groups .",
    "the concentration of the host haloe and the effects of tidal reduction of the satellite galaxies in groups may alter the central velocity dispersions .",
    "the appearance of intra - group stars is strong evidence for the reduction of the satellite luminosities . according to @xcite the velocity dispersion provides a very unreliable measure of system mass .",
    "the concentration and its influence on tidal reduction add more concerns on the accuracy of such mass estimates .",
    "combined observations of x - ray temperatures and velocity dispersions of satellite galaxies have recently become available for groups . as a application of the present analysis",
    "these observations my be used to infer the impact of tidal forces onto the central satellite population . if tidal forces in fossil groups efficiently reduce the number of detectable satellites , we expect the central velocity dispersion to be high compared to the x - ray temperature .",
    "some support for this scenario has been found by @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the x - ray temperatures of the hot intra - group gas with the velocity dispersions found for the satellite galaxies can be used to infer the degree of tidal disruption .",
    "a flattening of the central number density profiles along with an increasing velocity dispersion are the signatures of tidal reduction of the central subhaloe or satellite population .",
    "@xcite considers radial velocity dispersions in fossil systems at a fixed radius @xmath112 .",
    "we have presented a uniform fitting formula for the anisotropy parameter provided the group - centric distances are scaled by @xmath7 , the characteristic radius of the nfw - profile of the host .",
    "fossil groups are assumed to be early formed systems ( see e.g.  @xcite ) with high concentrations .",
    "our fitting formula implies that at a fixed radius more concentrated hosts generate more radially anisotropic velocity dispersions .",
    "this result has to be taken into account if the velocity dispersions of different groups are compared at physically similar radii .",
