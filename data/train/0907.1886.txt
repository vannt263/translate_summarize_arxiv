    "a knowledge of the cross sections for single pion production in neutrino - nucleon scattering is an important ingredient of the long base - line oscillation experiment analyses ( see experiments : k2k @xcite and t2k @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , prediction of the cross sections for @xmath3 production in neutral current neutrino - nucleon scattering has great importance for the estimation of the background for observation of the @xmath4 neutrino oscillation .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath5 decay signal into two photons can be mislead in the detector with the electron shower .",
    "more than twenty years ago two bubble chamber experiments : 12 ft detector at argonne national laboratory ( anl ) @xcite and 7 ft detector at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) @xcite had collected enough data to investigate the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and energy dependence of the differential and total cross sections for neutrino - deuteron scattering .",
    "the anl and bnl experimental measurements can still serve as an important source of information about cross sections for quasi - elastic and single pion production in neutrino scattering .",
    "the nuclear effects ( deuteron structure corrections ) are relatively easy to consider , therefore analysis of these data allows to study neutrino - nucleon reactions .    in this paper",
    "a part of the re - analysis @xcite of the neutrino - deuteron scattering data is presented .",
    "we re - examine the single pion production in neutrino deuteron interactions .",
    "our aim is re - extraction of the @xmath0 axial form factor from the @xmath8 data . in this article",
    "we discuss only the data collected at argonne national laboratory . in the longer contribution",
    "simultaneous analysis of both anl and bnl data is described .",
    "the presentation is organized as follows in sect .",
    "[ section_single_pion_production ] the model for @xmath9 excitation is shortly introduced .",
    "[ section_reanalysis_anl ] contains description of the anl data and details of the statistical analysis .",
    "[ section_result ] includes our final results and conclusions .",
    "we consider the following process : @xmath10 by the @xmath11 and @xmath12 the neutrino and muon four - momenta are denoted .",
    "the incoming nucleon momentum is denoted by @xmath13 , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the final pion and proton momenta .",
    "the four momentum transfer is defined as follows @xmath16 .",
    "the total hadronic momentum is @xmath17 .",
    "one of the simplest way to describe above reaction is to apply the adler - rarita - schwinger formalism @xcite . in this description",
    "the scattering amplitude is given by the contraction of the lepton @xmath18 with the hadronic @xmath19 currents .",
    "the hadronic current has vector - axial structure , where the vector contribution is modeled by three unknown vector form factors @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . for these form factors we apply recent fits from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in general the axial contribution to the hadronic current is given by four form factors , however , additional constrains , motivated by adler model @xcite and pcac hypothesis , reduce the number of unknown functions to the one : @xmath0 .",
    "in the present analysis we consider the dipole parametrization of the @xmath0 axial form factor : @xmath23 the axial mass @xmath24 is a parameter to fit .",
    "we distinguish two fit cases :    * the value of @xmath25 is established by pcac and equals @xmath26 @xcite ; * @xmath25 is treated as a free parameter .",
    "a subject of our analysis is the differential cross section data @xmath27 which was published in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the reaction ( [ rection ] )",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the excitation of the @xmath9 resonance .",
    "the nonresonant background can be neglected .",
    "the proper analysis of the ( [ rection ] ) process requires taking into consideration the deuteron structure effects . in this work",
    "we follow the approach proposed in ref . @xcite . from the practical point of view , in order to obtain the differential cross section for neutrino - deuteron scattering , we multiply neutrino-_free nucleon _ @xmath28 formula by @xmath29 correcting function .",
    "it is obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite ( for more details see .",
    "@xcite ) .    to analyze the data we apply the standard @xmath30 approach . besides statistical and non - correlated systematical uncertainties in each @xmath31 bin , we take into account the overall uncertainty of the neutrino beam .",
    "it introduces to the standard @xmath30 formula additional normalization term : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the theoretical and experimental values of the differential cross sections .",
    "@xmath35 denotes error in each @xmath31 bin .",
    "@xmath15 is the uncertainty of the neutrino flux and @xmath13 is the normalization parameter which is going to be fitted .    in order to compute the theoretical values of the cross section the following kinematical cuts",
    "are imposed : for the neutrino energy @xmath36  gev , and for the hadronic invariant mass @xmath37  gev .",
    "the data covers the range in @xmath7 from @xmath38  gev@xmath39 to @xmath40  gev@xmath39 .",
    "the theoretical formula for the differential cross section in a given @xmath7 bin is the following : @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 where @xmath45  gev and @xmath46  gev .    as it was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite the normalization uncertainty of the total cross section , due to the lack of knowledge about the flux is estimated to be 15% for @xmath47  gev and 25% for @xmath48  gev . therefore in our discussion , we assume the average overall normalization uncertainty to be 20% , @xmath49 .",
    "in tab . [ table_dipole_results ] the results of our fitting procedure are shown . in the analysis we consider four different cases .",
    "we start the fitting procedure without accounting deuteron correction .",
    "the results are shown in the first two rows of the tab .",
    "[ table_dipole_results ] ) .",
    "then the deuteron corrections are taken into consideration ( look at the third and fourth rows of the tab .",
    "[ table_dipole_results ] ) .",
    "the comparison of our fits with the anl data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_anl_dif ] , where both the differential and total cross sections are plotted .",
    "our final result ( with deuteron effects ) is : @xmath50    as it can be noticed for all fits the obtained values of @xmath51 ( ndf  number of degrees of freedom ) are very good .",
    "we observe that the axial mass , which is responsible for the shape of @xmath52 , is not affected by the deuteron corrections .",
    "the deuteron nuclear effects affect mainly the normalization of the cross section , therefore they are compensated by the normalization parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the largest suppression of the @xmath53 , due to deuteron effects appears in low-@xmath7 ( below 0.1  gev@xmath39 ) .",
    "that is why the fit of @xmath54 without deuteron correction is relatively low ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "when the deuteron effects are accounted the obtained value is @xmath56 which is very close to the pcac value .",
    "however , both results for @xmath25 are always in agreement with the pcac value .",
    "the fits obtained for the anl data turns out to be quite similar to those obtained from the simultaneous fit to both the anl and bnl data . the full presentation of this analysis will be published in ref .",
