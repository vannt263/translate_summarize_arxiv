    "since the original discovery of the `` proton spin crisis '' @xcite there has been enormous progress in our knowledge and understanding of the spin structure functions of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "it is well known that through the u(1 ) axial anomaly polarised gluons can contribute to the spin structure function of the proton @xcite and that this is quite likely the source of most of the discepancy with the naive ellis - jaffe sum rule .",
    "tests of this idea are now focussed on direct measurements of the polarised gluon content at hermes , compass and rhic .    in comparison with the ellis - jaffe sum rule ,",
    "the bjorken sum rule is still on a very sound theoretical foundation and provides a crucial test of our understanding of qcd . in order to check it",
    "one needs data for the neutron spin structure function , a task complicated by the absence of free neutron targets .",
    "traditionally neutron data has been extracted from data on the deuteron @xcite by subtracting the proton contribution . apart from fermi motion and binding corrections this is complicated by the presence of completely new terms not present for a free nucleon @xcite  although numerical estimates suggest that these terms are negligible for a system as weakly bound as the deuteron .",
    "the main problem with the deuteron is that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 spins are aligned so that one has to subtract two numbers of comparable size ( @xmath5 from @xmath6 ) to get the neutron data .",
    "an attractive alternative is to use polarised @xmath2he @xcite , where the spins of the two protons are mainly coupled to zero , so that the neutron carries most of the nuclear spin . as a consequence",
    ", the corrections to be applied to the data to obtain the neutron structure function are expected to be much smaller than for the deuteron . yet , binding and fermi motion are larger , as are shadowing corrections and meson exchange currents  especially those involving the @xmath7 .",
    "the shadowing corrections are especially significant in the small-@xmath1 region , where most of the contribution from polarised gluons is also concentrated . in section 3",
    "we outline recent progress in the calculation of those corrections which are relevant at intermediate and large-@xmath1 .",
    "first , however , we recall the main non - perturbative aspects of nucleon structure that can be tested by extending measurements to larger values of @xmath1 than have so far been accessible .",
    "while the emphasis for the last decade has been on extending our knowledge of spin structure functions to smaller @xmath1 , we stress that there is a lot to be learnt by heading in the opposite direction .",
    "large-@xmath1 has proven to be a source of surprises for unpolarised structure functions , with recent analysis @xcite suggesting that the @xmath9 ratio may not go to zero ( unlike the standard parametrisations of parton distributions universally assume ) but is rather consistent with the predictions of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite .",
    "further experiments are planned at places like jlab to test this analysis @xcite .    in the spin",
    "dependent case we have no idea whatsoever of the behaviour of @xmath0 beyond @xmath10 . on the basis of both pqcd _ and _ su(6 ) @xcite , one expects @xmath11 to approach 1 as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it is vital to test this prediction .",
    "if it fails we understand nothing about the valence spin structure of the nucleon ! looking in a little more detail , we see that the present data at small-@xmath1 corresponds to a negative asymmetry and hence there must be a crossover at some intermediate @xmath1 value .",
    "locating the crossover is an important experimental challenge . from the theoretical point of view the value of @xmath1 at which this occurs",
    "is the result of a competition between the su(6 ) valence structure @xcite and the chiral corrections @xcite .",
    "the positive sign of the neutron asymmetry in the larger @xmath1 region is a result of the dominance there of @xmath13 spectator pairs ( which have lower mass than @xmath14 pairs ) @xcite . within the su(6 )",
    "framework , the only valence quark with a spin-0 pair of spectators is a @xmath15-quark which has its spin aligned with the spin of the neutron  and hence the asymmetry is positive .",
    "this phenomenon has been studied at great length , not only for the spin - flavor dependence of nucleon parton distributions @xcite but also for the parton distributions and fragmentation functions of other members of the nucleon octet @xcite .",
    "the competition comes from the @xmath16 and @xmath17 fock components of the wave function of the nucleon @xcite , corresponding to the leading and next - to - leading non - analytic chiral behaviour of the structure function @xcite . in view of the interest in di - quark models of the nucleon @xcite , as well as the role of dynamical symmetry breaking ,",
    "it is imperative to have as much experimental guidance as possible and the insight from accurate data on @xmath0 at intermediate and large @xmath1 would be extremely valuable .",
    "within the usual impulse approximation , @xmath19 can be represented as the convolution of the neutron ( @xmath20 ) and proton ( @xmath21 ) spin structure functions with the spin - dependent nucleon light - cone momentum distributions @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the ratio of the struck nucleon to nucleus light - cone plus components of the momenta @xmath24 the motion of the nucleons inside the nucleus ( fermi motion ) and their binding are parametrized through the distributions @xmath25 , which can be readily calculated using the ground - state wave function of @xmath2he .",
    "detailed calculations @xcite by various groups . using different ground - state wave functions for @xmath2he",
    ", have come to similar conclusions , namely that @xmath22 is sharply peaked around @xmath26 because of the small average separation energy per nucleon .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ conv1 ] ) is often approximated by @xmath27 where @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are the effective polarizations of the neutron ( proton ) inside polarized @xmath2he , defined by @xmath30 in the first approximation to the ground - state wave function of @xmath2he , only the neutron is polarized . in this case ,",
    "@xmath31=1 and @xmath32=0 .",
    "realistic approaches to the wave function of @xmath2he include also higher partial waves , notably the @xmath33 and @xmath34 partial waves .",
    "this leads to the depolarization of the spin of the neutron and polarization of protons in @xmath2he .",
    "the average of calculations with several models of the nucleon - nucleon interaction and three - nucleon forces can be summarized as @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the calculations of @xcite give similar values : @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the pest potential with 5 channels .",
    "we shall use these values for @xmath28 and @xmath29 throughout this paper .",
    "most of the uncertainty in the values for @xmath28 and @xmath29 comes from the uncertainty in the @xmath33-wave of the @xmath2he wave function .",
    "thus , for the observables that are especially sensitive to the poorly constrained @xmath29 , any theoretical predictions carry a significant uncertainty .",
    "one example of such an observable is the point where the neutron structure function @xmath20 has a node .",
    "the description of the nucleus as a mere collection of protons and neutrons is incomplete . in polarized dis on the tri - nucleon system",
    ", this observation can be illustrated by the following example @xcite .",
    "the bjorken sum rule relates the difference of the first moments of the proton and neutron spin structure functions to the axial vector coupling constant of the neutron , @xmath40 @xcite , @xmath41 here the qcd radiative corrections are denoted as `` @xmath42 '' .",
    "this sum rule can be straightforwardly generalized to the @xmath2he-@xmath2h system , with @xmath43 , the axial vector coupling constant of the triton ( @xmath44 @xcite ) replacing @xmath45 .",
    "taking the ratio of the bjorken sum rules for @xmath46 and the nucleon , one obtains @xmath47 note that the qcd radiative corrections cancel exactly in eq .",
    "( [ delta3 ] ) .    assuming charge symmetry between the @xmath2he and @xmath2h ground - state wave functions , one can write the triton spin structure function @xmath48 in the form : @xmath49 this leads to the following estimate for the ratio of the nuclear to nucleon bjorken sum rules @xmath50 here we used @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are , respectively , the spin sums for bound and free nucleons .",
    "such off - shell corrections were estimated within the framework of the quark - meson coupling model @xcite in ref .",
    "they were not large and showed a tendency to decrease , rather than increase , the bound nucleon spin structure functions ( i.e. @xmath53 ) .",
    "thus , one can immediately see that the theoretical prediction for the ratio of the bjorken sum rule for the @xmath46 and @xmath54 systems ( eq .  ( [ delta5 ] ) ) , based solely on nucleonic degrees of freedom , underestimates the experimental result for the same ratio ( eq .  ( [ delta3 ] ) ) by about 3.5% .",
    "this demonstrates the need for new nuclear effects .",
    "it has been known for a long time that non - nucleonic degrees of freedom , such as pions , vector mesons , the @xmath7(1232 ) isobar , can play an important role in the calculation of some low - energy observables in nuclear physics .",
    "in particular , the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the two - body exchange currents involving a @xmath7isobar increase the theoretical prediction for the axial vector coupling constant of the triton by about 4% , which makes it consistent with experiment . in order to preserve the bjorken sum rule",
    ", exactly the same mechanism must be present in case of deep inelastic scattering on polarized @xmath2he and @xmath2h .",
    "indeed , as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite , the direct correspondence between the calculations of the gamow - teller matrix element in the triton @xmath55 decay and the feynman diagrams for dis on @xmath2he and @xmath2h ( see fig .  1 of @xcite )",
    "requires that two - body exchange currents should play an equal role in both processes . as a result , the presence of the @xmath7 in the @xmath2he and @xmath2h wave functions should increase the ratio of eq .",
    "( [ delta5 ] ) and make it consistent with eq .",
    "( [ delta3 ] ) .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath7(1232 ) to @xmath19 is realized through diagrams involving the non - diagonal interference transitions @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this requires new spin structure functions , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , as well as the effective polarizations @xmath60 and @xmath61 . taking into account the interference transitions",
    "leads to a correction to the @xmath46 spin structure functions , @xmath62 : @xmath63 , \\label{delta6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath64 signs correspond to @xmath2he / h , respectively .",
    "the interference structure functions can be related to @xmath21 and @xmath20 within the quark parton model using the general structure of the su(6 ) wave functions @xcite @xmath65 this simple relationship is valid in the range of @xmath1 and @xmath66 where the contribution of sea quarks and gluons to @xmath67 can be safely omitted , i.e. for @xmath68 gev@xmath69 and @xmath70 if the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite is used .    in principle , the effective polarizations of the interference contributions @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be calculated using a @xmath2he wave function that includes the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "this is an involved computational problem .",
    "instead , we chose to find @xmath60 and @xmath61 by _ requiring _ that the use of the @xmath2he and @xmath2h structure functions of eq .",
    "( [ delta6 ] ) gives the experimental ratio of the nuclear to nucleon bjorken sum rules ( [ delta3 ] ) .",
    "this yields the effective polarizations @xcite : @xmath71 ( note that this value is very close to that reported in ref .  @xcite . )",
    "clearly one can now write an explicit expression for the @xmath2he spin structure function , which takes into account the additional diagrams corresponding to the non - diagonal interference @xmath56 and @xmath57 transitions ; thus ensuring agreement with the experimental value of the ratio of the bjorken sum rules .",
    "the results of such a calculation of @xmath19 at @xmath72 gev@xmath69 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] as the solid curve .",
    "( solid curve ) , compared with that computed by allowing for fermi motion and binding , with ( dash - dotted curve ) and without ( dashed curve ) the inclusion of off - shell corrections ( osc ) , estimated in the qmc model .",
    "the free neutron spin structure function , @xmath20 , is shown by the dotted curve .",
    "for all curves @xmath66=4 gev@xmath69 . ]",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] that the presence of the @xmath7(1232 ) isobar in the @xmath2he wave function works to decrease @xmath19 relative to the prediction of fermi motion and binding alone .",
    "this decrease is 12% at @xmath73 and increases at larger @xmath1 , peaking for @xmath74 , where @xmath20 changes sign .",
    "we note that , since the convolution formalism implies _",
    "incoherent _ scattering off nucleons and nucleon resonances of the target , coherent nuclear effects present at small values of bjorken @xmath1 are being ignored here . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the role played by two coherent effects , namely nuclear shadowing and antishadowing , in dis on polarized @xmath2he were also considered .",
    "as these corrections are not significant in the large-@xmath1 region , which is of concern to us here , we pursue this question no further .      the dis asymmetry @xmath75 for any target @xmath76 is proportional to the spin structure function @xmath77 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are inclusive spin - averaged structure functions .",
    "it is assumed in eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) that the transverse spin asymmetry , @xmath81 , is negligibly small and that @xmath82 does not depend on the choice of target .",
    "applying this definition of @xmath75 to the @xmath2he , proton and neutron targets and including the effects of fermi motion , binding and @xmath7isobars outlined above , one obtains for the neutron asymmetry @xmath83 @xmath84 provided that the proton asymmetry , @xmath85 , is constrained well by the experimental data , the largest theoretical uncertainty comes from the uncertainty in the proton spin polarization @xmath29 .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainty in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ a1n ] ) and , thus , in the position of the point where @xmath83 has a zero , is of the order 10% @xcite .    in eq.([a1n ] ) the terms proportional to @xmath86 and @xmath87 represent the correction to @xmath83 associated with the @xmath7 isobar .",
    "both terms are important for the correct determination of @xmath83 . the term proportional to @xmath86 decreases the absolute value of @xmath83 by about 6% . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath88 is negative , the second term proportional to @xmath87 would work in the same direction of decreasing of @xmath89 .",
    "since the term proportional to @xmath87 is always positive , this means that the true @xmath83 should turn positive at lower values of @xmath1 compared to the situation when the effect of the @xmath7 is ignored .",
    "it is therefore vital to account for these corrections in any extraction of @xmath0 from @xmath2he data in this region @xcite .",
    "in conclusion we reiterate the importance of experiments aimed at extracting information on the large-@xmath1 behaviour of the nucleon spin structure  especially that of the neutron .",
    "the results cast important light onto the valence structure of the nucleon , testing our understanding of su(6 ) symmetry and the applicability of di - quark models . in order to extract this information from nuclear targets",
    "it is important to use a thorough theoretical analysis , including in particular the effects of @xmath7isobars in the three - body wave function .",
