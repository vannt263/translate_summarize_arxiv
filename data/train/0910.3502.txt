    "a variety of systems display dramatically different thermal diffusivities .",
    "for example , the thermal conductivity is estimated at 3000 w / mk for an isolated multiwall carbon nanotube ( cnt ) and between 1750 and 6600 w / mk for a single wall carbon nanotube at room temperature.@xcite typical polymer matrices , in contrast , have thermal conductivities that are three orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "composites using carbon nanotubes have been suggested as cheap materials with average thermal conductivity.@xcite however making improved thermal conducting polymer composites has been hindered due to the kapitza thermal resistance and various processing issues .",
    "it may be possible to alter this resistance through functionalizing the ends or surface of the cnts , although this may decrease the thermal conductivity of the material .",
    "the problem of optimizing the thermal conductivity of cnt composites presents an intriguing combination of high conductivity contrast , strong disorder , and incorporated materials with an extremely high aspect ratio . thus an efficient and reliable method to calculate effective thermal conductivity and varying interface resistance in this two phase medium is desirable .",
    "this problem has been studied in the context of electrical conductivity.@xcite however , the inclusions in thermal transport can have be quite asymmetric and entangled . in these cases",
    "it the isotropic averaging models may not apply .",
    "one approach to model the thermal transport in composites is to use a random walk algorithm in which the transport is assumed to be diffusive .",
    "for instance , tomadakis and sotirchos @xcite has used this approach to find the effective transport properties of random arrays of cylinders in a conductive matrix .",
    "recently , doung et.al @xcite developed a random walk algorithm to model thermal transport in carbon nanotube - polymer composites and the simulation results showed a reasonable agreement with the experimental data for epoxy - swnt composites@xcite . in this approach thermal transport is described by random jumps of thermal markers carrying a certain amount of energy ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the step size(@xmath1 ) of this thermal markers follows the gaussian distribution.(see eq.[eq : onedgaussian ] ) the standard deviation ( @xmath2 ) of the gaussian step distribution in each one of the space dimensions is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the time increment , @xmath5 refers to matrix or inclusions and @xmath6 is the thermal diffusivity .",
    "however problem arises when their is a high contrast in thermal diffusivity of matrix and inclusions .",
    "the step size in highly conducting inclusions @xmath7 become very large compare to the that of poorly conducting matrix @xmath8 . eventually this leads the markers to jump out the inclusions as soon as they enter .",
    "this can be avoided having very small steps inside the matrix so that the steps inside the inclusions are within the dimensions of the inclusions .",
    "but this is computationally expensive .",
    "when the thermal diffusivity of the inclusion is very high relative to the matrix it is reasonable to assume that the thermal diffusivity of the inclusions is infinite .",
    "this obviates the need to model random walks inside the inclusions . in this approach markers entering an infinite conductivity inclusion ( ici )",
    "are distributed uniformly inside the inclusion on the next time step .",
    "some fraction will leave on the next time step and they always leave from the surface of the inclusion .",
    "( otherwise the simulation wastes time on walkers that hop within the ici . )",
    "however , we must be careful in choosing how the walkers leave the the ici since incorrect approaches can lead to the unphysical result of a system at uniform temperature spontaneously developing a temperature gradient at the interface between the inclusion and the medium.@xcite while the effect is apparently small , it must be remembered that diffusion occurs at these same interfaces . in this paper",
    "we provide a rigorous approach for implementing a random walk algorithm with emphasis on the treatment at the interface between the inclusions and the matrix material for high conductivity contrast composites , and we quantify the errors made when gaussian and modified step distributions are employed .",
    "this paper is divided into four parts . in the first",
    ", we briefly describe the algorithm for `` infinite conductivity '' inclusions .",
    "next , we show the rigorous way to handle inclusions in one dimensional systems .",
    "we verify our results numerically in ordered and disordered systems , and compare them to results obtained by assuming that the walkers leave the surface with a gaussian step distribution . in the next section",
    "we develop this approach to spheres in three dimensions and again verify it numerically , showing quantitatively the errors that develop if a gaussian step distribution from the surface is used .",
    "interestingly , the errors in thermal conductivity are larger in 3d than in 1d and larger for random arrays than for regular ones . in the final section",
    "we conclude with a summary and a discussion of future work .",
    "the goal is to calculate the thermal conductivity of a composite composed of a matrix containing a distribution of `` infinite conductors '' ( ics ) .",
    "this conductivity is calculated by fixing the heat flux through the computational volume and measuring the resulting average temperature gradient .",
    "the diffusion of heat is modelled by the motion of random walkers within the domain .",
    "the computational cell is divided in bins , and the temperature distribution is calculated from the number of walkers in each bin . to maintain a constant heat flux in the @xmath9 direction through the computational cell , random walkers carrying @xmath10 energy are periodically added at the surface @xmath11 , and then allowed to move with random jumps that follow a gaussian distribution into the computational cell . in order to fix an `` outward '' energy flux on the opposite surface",
    ", random walkers carrying @xmath12 energy are added at the surface @xmath13 at the same rate as the positive markers .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath12 thermal markers are often called `` hot '' and `` cold '' walkers . the exact size of @xmath0 is arbitrary : the heat flux might be modelled by many small walkers or one large one .",
    "however using too many walkers is computionally ineffcient , while too few produces noisy results that requires more runs to get better averages . in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 direction the computaional domain",
    "is assumed to be periodic .",
    "the solution at steady states yields a linear temperature profiile and the thermal conductivity can be extracted from fourier s law . to incorporate the effect of the kapitza thermal resistance , walkers in the matrix that would normally attempt to jump into the ic",
    "can only do so with a probability @xmath16.@xcite thus they stay in the matrix phase with a probability @xmath17 .",
    "the value of @xmath16 is determined by the kapitza resistance .",
    "this can be estimated using acoustic mismatch model when the physical properties of the materials are known.@xcite    similarly , random walkers located within the ic have a probability to hop out on each time step .",
    "exactly what fraction of the walkers should leave in each time step , and the exact nature of the probability distribution for the steps they should take from the surafce are determined in the next two sections . however , those that do leave , exit at random positions on the ic .",
    "this is done to model the `` infinite '' conductivity of ic so that the walker distribution within the ic is uniform .",
    "collisions between walkers are ignored .",
    "the random walk reflects the scattering of phonons in the disordered matrix material",
    ". walker - walker scattering would reflect nonlinear thermal conductivities which are typically small .",
    "similarly , we assume that the properties of the materials ( e.g. density , specific heat , thermal relaxation length ) do not change with temperature over the range modelled .",
    "finally , we assume that the product of the mass density of ic and specific heat capacity equals that of the matrix , so that in thermal equilibrium the walker density would be uniform inside and out of the ic s .",
    "this is done for simplicity , so that the local temperature is simply proportional to the difference of the average density of hot and cold walkers . without this assumption",
    "we would have to alter the probability of walkers entering and leaving the ic s so that in thermal equilibrium , the ratio of average walker density inside the ic to that of the matrix equals the ratio of their volumetric heat capacities .",
    "only then would the equilibrium walker distribution represent a uniform temperature .",
    "below we describe how to efficiently handle the random walks in a fashion that satisfies the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the difficulty lies in properly handling the random walkers that jump out from the high conductivity material . to make the explanation clear , we first look at the one dimensional case . we subsequently address the three dimensional case for spherical inclusions in section [ sec:3d ] .",
    "we consider a set of random walkers moving in a one dimensional ring , half made from an `` infinitely conducting material '' as show in fig.[fig : onedmodel ] .",
    "we can view this as a one dimensional line with boundaries at @xmath18 .",
    "we know that in equilibrium the density of random walkers throughout the whole ring should be uniform .",
    "consider a surface located at @xmath19 , as shown in fig.[fig : onedmodel].b .",
    "the flux of random walkers from the left through the surface must equal that from the right .",
    "this is not a problem for a surface located near the center of the interval .",
    "however , if @xmath20 , the flux of random walkers from right _ in the matrix medium _ can not balance those from the left ; there are too few of them .",
    "the solution lies in that the difference must be made up from random walkers leaving the infinite  conductivity material .",
    "if they were distributed uniformly throughout the infinite conducting material , their flux would maintain the equilibrium .    .",
    "the difficulty is that in equilibrium the net flux through any surface ( e.g. the dashed line ) must be zero .",
    "walkers hopping through the surface from the shaded region in fig.(b ) must be balanced by walkers leaving the right hand infinite conductor .",
    "this implies that if random walkers always leave the _ surface _ of the infinite conductor ( ic ) , they must have a different jump distribution than random walkers inside the `` normal '' region . ]",
    "we do not wish to model the inside of the ic inclusions because random walkers within them move on a much faster time scale than those outside .",
    "we assume that a random walker instantly leaves from any point on the surface ( in this case from @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , since they leave always exactly from the surface , their step distribution must be different from that of random walkers within the matrix medium .    in each step of the simulation we move the walkers inside the interval @xmath21 , as well as those outside .",
    "we wish to do this in a fashion that is in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "let the probability that a walker in the matrix medium jumps from @xmath22 to @xmath23 be given by : @xmath24 in each time interval we can see that only a fraction of the walkers inside the ic will leave , or else their density would not equal that in the normal medium . in this simple model , we require that the number inside the matrix medium ( @xmath25 ) equals that outside ( @xmath26 ) in the ic .",
    "we also require that the net flux through a surface located at @xmath19 is zero .",
    "the flux to the left from particles lying in the matrix region , @xmath27 is balanced by the flux to the right for those lying between @xmath28 .",
    "however those in the shaded region of fig.[fig : onedmodel ] are not so compensated .",
    "they must be balanced by a net flux of walkers leaving the righthand boundary .",
    "denote the flux from the shaded region to the right by @xmath29 ; it is : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the complementary error function , @xmath32 .",
    "we are summing over any walker starting in the shaded region ending up anywhere to the right of the barrier .",
    "we have let the upper limit of the endpoint of the jump to infinity since @xmath33 ; we extend the lower limit of the first integral to @xmath34 , and we have shifted variables to @xmath35 .",
    "we neglect any walkers leaping from the ic on the left boundary @xmath36 all the way through @xmath37 .",
    "the flux @xmath29 must be balanced by the flux from walkers leaving the ic on the right .",
    "let the probability that a random walker in the ic leaves it be given by @xmath38 , and the probability that it jumps to a point @xmath9 , leaving from the right hand boundary , be @xmath39 .",
    "then the flux to the left through the surface at @xmath19 due to these walkers is @xmath40 we set @xmath41 , and take the derivative of both sides with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "this gives us an integral expression for @xmath42 : @xmath43\\ ] ] the requirements that @xmath44 and the balancing of the fluxes when @xmath45 is enough to solve for @xmath42 .",
    "the distribution of steps , @xmath46 is given by : @xmath47      the above analytical calculation provides the correct step distribution for walkers leaving the edge of the infinite conductors .",
    "we can compare it to a simple model where we simply have the walkers take a step with a gaussian probability distribution ( mean size 0.20 ) from the surface .",
    "fig.[fig : onedres ] is the spatial distribution of random walkers in such a one dimensional system.@xcite plotted are the average number of walkers in each of 20 bins , equally spaced @xmath48 over the course of @xmath49 monte carlo steps . starting with 500 random walkers , half should be in the matrix  region , so that the average number / bin should be 12.5 .",
    "the dashed line is the result of performing the simulation incorrectly , and letting the walkers have a gaussian step distribution as in eq.[eq : onedgaussian ] ; there are too many walkers in the interval , and their distribution is not uniform . the solid line is the result of using eq.[eq : onedstep ] , which yields the correct result , and is uniform .    . plotted are the average number of walkers in each of 20 bins , equally spaced @xmath48 over the course of @xmath50 monte carlo steps . starting with 500 random walkers",

    "we then extract the gradient in walker density and calculate the thermal conductivity .",
    "sample results are plotted in fig.([fig:1ddens ] ) , where we show the results for gaussian steps ( lower curve ) and steps governed by eq.([eq : onedstep ] ) ( upper curve ) .",
    "the latter gives physically reasonable results ( with noise ) , in which the temperature is constant the ics and uniformly decreasing in the matrix .",
    "the thermal conductivity is extracted from the ratio of the slope of the temperature ( the walker density ) to the applied flux . in fig.([fig:1dvar ] ) we plot the average value of the percent error in the thermal conductivity as a function of the transmission probability , @xmath16 , for regular and random 1d arrays . in this simulation",
    "the ics were 0.50 units long and the material between them was 1.00 units wide .",
    "the results are averaged over five runs each lasting for 40,000 time steps .",
    "the percent error is defined as the difference between the results of simulations using the gaussian steps and the results using eq.[eq : onedstep ] .",
    "the error bars represent the variation in thermal conductivities over the runs .",
    "thus we see that the error can range as large as five percent , and that can vary substantially .",
    "we have shown above that errors in one dimensional simulations are avoidable , but only a few percent . below",
    "we generalize the above problem to three dimensions for spherical inclusions , and show that the effect can be significant .      in our model random walkers that land inside the sphere",
    "are immediately moved to a random point on the surface of the sphere . on the next time",
    "step they can move in the radial direction away from the sphere .",
    "we assume that if we choose the fraction that leave and their step distribution correctly , then when we are in equilibrium we will obtain a uniform , stationary density outside and inside the sphere .",
    "the number of random walkers entering the sphere from a region @xmath51 near @xmath52 landing inside the sphere is given by : @xmath53    where we have generalized the probability distribution of eq.([eq : onedgaussian ] ) to three dimensions .",
