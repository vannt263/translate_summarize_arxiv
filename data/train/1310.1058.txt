    "a stochastic process @xmath2 counting the number of some sort of events occurring during a time interval @xmath0 $ ] is called a renewal process , if the time spans between consecutive events are independent , identically distributed random variables  @xcite .",
    "renewal theory does not specify the exact meaning or effect of a single event .",
    "it could be interpreted as the appearance of a head in a coin tossing game , the arrival of a bus or of a new customer in a queue . in a mathematical formulation ,",
    "events remain abstract objects characterized by the time of their occurrence .",
    "thus , not surprisingly , renewal processes are at the core of many stochastic problems found throughout all fields of science .",
    "maybe the most obvious physical application is the counting of decays from a radioactive substance .",
    "this is an example of a poissonian renewal process : the random time passing between consecutive decay events , the waiting time , has an exponential probability density function @xmath3 . in other words , events here are observed at a constant rate @xmath4 ( that is , if the sample is sufficiently large and the half - life of individual atoms sufficiently long ) .",
    "a physical problem of more contemporary interest is subrecoil laser cooling  @xcite .",
    "two counterpropagating electromagnetic waves can cool down individual atoms to an extent where they randomly switch between a trapped ( i.e. almost zero momentum ) state and a photon emitting state .",
    "successive life times of individual states are found to be independent and stationary in distribution .",
    "hence , the transitions from the trapped to the light emitting state form the events of a renewal process .",
    "similar in spirit , colloidal quantum dots @xcite switch between bright states and dark states under continuous excitation .",
    "in contrast to the poissonian decay process , the latter two examples feature a power - law distribution of occupation times @xmath5 , whose long time asymptotics reads @xmath6 such heavy - tailed distributions are not uncommon for physically relevant renewal processes . to see this , consider a simple unbounded , one - dimensional brownian motion , and let @xmath2 count the number of times the particle crosses the origin .",
    "then the waiting time between two crossings is of the form  ( [ intro : tail ] ) with @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , a random walk of electron - hole pairs either in physical space , or in energy space , was proposed as a mechanism leading to the power - law statistics of quantum dot blinking @xcite . in general , whenever events are triggered by domain crossings of a more complex , unbounded process , power - law distributed waiting times are to be expected .",
    "in addition , the latter can be interpreted as a superposition of exponential transition times with an ( infinitely ) wide range of rate constants @xmath8 . the power - law form ( [ intro : tail ] ) for the inter - event statistics is a typical ansatz to explain such renewal dynamics in highly disordered or heterogeneous media such as spin glasses  @xcite , amorphous semiconductors  @xcite or biological cells  @xcite .",
    "note that distributions as in  ( [ intro : tail ] ) imply a divergent average waiting time , @xmath9 .",
    "renewal processes of this type are said to be scale - free , since , roughly speaking , statistically dominant waiting times are always of the order of the observational time .",
    "hence , their outstanding characteristics play out most severely on long time scales : while for @xmath10 , poissonian renewal processes behave quasi - deterministically , @xmath11 ,",
    "heavy - tailed distributions lead to nontrivial random properties at all times . stochastic processes of this type are known to exhibit weak ergodicity breaking  @xcite , i.e. time averages and associated ensemble averages of a physical observable are not equivalent . moreover , despite the renewal property , the process @xmath2 is nonstationary  @xcite : events @xmath12 counted after an unattended aging period @xmath13 , i.e. within some time window @xmath1 $ ] , are found to be statistically very distinct from countings during the initial period @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "fewer events are counted during late measurements , in a statistical sense , and thus we also say the process exhibits _",
    "deeper analysis reveals that this slowing down of dynamics is due to an increasingly large probability to count no events at all during observation .",
    "intuitively , in the limit of long times @xmath14 , one would expect to see at least some renewal activity @xmath15 .",
    "instead , the probability to have exactly @xmath16 increases steadily , and as @xmath17 , the system becomes completely trapped .",
    "the first part of our article is devoted to an in - depth discussion of the aging renewal process .",
    "we directly build on the original work of  @xcite , calculating and discussing extensively the pdf of the aged counting process @xmath18 , with a special emphasis on aging mediated effects .",
    "we provide leading order approximations for slightly and strongly aged systems , and discuss their validity .",
    "we then derive the consequences for related ensemble averages , and discuss the special impact of the uneventful realizations .",
    "the second part addresses the question of how these peculiar statistical effects translate to physical applications of renewal theory .",
    "our case study is the celebrated continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) @xcite .",
    "originally introduced to model charge carrier transport in amorphous semiconductors  @xcite , it has been successfully applied to many physical and geological problems  @xcite , and was identified as diffusion process in living cells  @xcite .",
    "it extends standard random walk models due to the possibility to have random waiting times between consecutive steps .",
    "heavy - tailed waiting times  ( [ intro : tail ] ) are of course of special interest to us , and we review several well studied phenomena inherent to ctrw models in the light of aging renewal theory . indeed , the insights gained from the first part of our discussion help us to contribute several new aspects to the bigger picture , especially with respect to aging phenomena ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "thus we analyze the scatter of time averages and their deviation from the corresponding ensemble averages ( the fingerprint of weak ergodicity breaking @xcite ) under aging conditions .",
    "we report strong conceptual differences between aging effects on time and ensemble averages , yet they exhibit identical time scalings at late ages .",
    "furthermore , we discuss a novel population splitting mechanism , which is a direct consequence of the discrete , increasing probability to measure @xmath16 steps during late observation : a certain fraction within an ensemble of ctrw particles stands out statistically from the rest as being fully immobilized .",
    "finally , we use the methods and formulae developed in the course of our discussion to analyze a model combination of ctrw and fractional langevin equation motion  @xcite . by this",
    "we include the effects of binding and friction forces , and a persistent memory component .",
    "we discuss the intricate interplay of aging and relaxation modes and highlight the essential features and pitfalls for aged ensemble and single trajectory measurements .",
    "we here analyze in detail a renewal process with distinct non - markovian characteristics , focusing especially on its aging properties . in that",
    ", we proceed as follows . in section  [ renewal :",
    "process ] , we define the aging renewal process and introduce some basic notation and concepts to be used throughout the rest of this work .",
    "we then turn to a long time scaling limit description of the renewal process in section  [ renewal : scalinglimit ] . in the case of scale - free waiting times , we obtain a continuous time counting process with interesting nonstationary random properties",
    ". sections  [ renewal : process ] and  [ renewal : scalinglimit ] have review character , and we refer to the original works for more detailed discussions on generalized limit theorems . here",
    ", we concentrate on the time evolution of the renewal probability distribution , which we study extensively in section  [ renewal : distribution ] .",
    "in particular , we discuss the emergence of both a discrete and a continuous contribution and contrast slightly and highly aged systems in terms of the behavior around the origin , around local maxima , and in the tails .",
    "the implications for calculating and interpreting ensemble averages are deduced in section  [ renewal : averages ] . with the probability distribution separating into discrete and continuous contributions ,",
    "it is natural to consider conditional averages , an issue we address in section  [ renewal : conditionalaverages ] .",
    "suppose we are interested in a series of events that occur starting from time @xmath19 .",
    "we may later choose to specifically identify these events with the arrival of a bus , the steps of a random walk , or the blinking of a quantum dot  for now , they remain abstract .",
    "let @xmath2 count the number of events that occurred up to time @xmath5 ; we occasionally refer to it as a counting process .",
    "the time spans between two consecutive events are called waiting times .",
    "they are not necessarily fixed .",
    "instead , we take them to be independent , identically distributed random variables . in such a case",
    ", it is justified to refer to events as _ renewals _ : the process @xmath2 is not necessarily markovian , but any memory on the past is erased with the occurrence of an event  the process is renewed .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of individual waiting times is denoted by  @xmath20 .",
    "obviously , the nature of this quantity heavily influences the statistics of the overall renewal process .",
    "figure  [ fig.renprocess ] shows realizations for deterministic periodic renewals , @xmath21 , for poissonian waiting times , @xmath22 , and for heavy - tailed waiting times , i.e. @xmath20 has the long-@xmath5 asymptotics  ( [ intro : tail ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath23 serves as a microscopic time scale for individual waiting times .",
    "first , study the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.renprocess ] , which focuses on the initial evolution of these processes at short time scales .",
    "the complete regularity of the deterministic renewals is distinct , but the two random counting processes are not clearly discernible by study of such single , short - period observations .",
    "now compare this to the main figure , which depicts realizations of the processes on much longer time scales . here ,",
    "the realizations of the deterministic and poissonian renewal processes look almost identical . recall that for independent exponential waiting times , the average time elapsing until the @xmath24th step is made increases linearly with @xmath24 , while the fluctuations around this average grow like @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the relative deviation from the average decays to zero on longer scales . roughly speaking , on time scales that are long as compared to the average waiting time @xmath26 we observe a quasi - deterministic relation @xmath27 .    for heavy - tailed waiting times as in  ( [ intro : tail ] ) , the picture is inherently different . above scaling arguments",
    "fail , since the typical time scale to compare to , the average @xmath28 of a single waiting time , is infinite .",
    "this is why this type of dynamics are sometimes referred to as scale - free and they are studied in light of generalized central limit theorems @xcite .",
    "we sketch some of the analytical aspects in the following section .",
    "most importantly , it turns out that in the absence of a typical time scale , waiting time periods persist and are statistically relevant on arbitrarily long time scales . the effect is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig.renprocess ] : the renewal process @xmath2 remains a nontrivial random process , even when @xmath10 .",
    "we also introduce at this point the concept of an aged measurement : while the renewal process starts at time @xmath29 , an observer might only be willing to or capable of counting events starting from a later time @xmath13 . in place of the total number of renewals @xmath2 he then studies the counted fraction @xmath30 .",
    "the fundamental statistical difference between the renewal processes @xmath24 and @xmath18 stems from the statistics of the time period @xmath31 which passes between start of the measurement at @xmath32 and the observation of the very first event .",
    "we refer to it as the _ forward recurrence time _",
    "@xcite and denote its pdf by @xmath33 . if the observer counts starting at time @xmath34 , the forward recurrence time is simply distributed like any other waiting time , @xmath35 .",
    "but for later , aged measurements , @xmath13 , the distribution is different , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig.renprocess ] .",
    "we call the dependence of the statistical properties of the counted renewals @xmath18 on the starting time of the measurement @xmath32 an aging effect .",
    "its impact crucially depends on the waiting time distribution in use .",
    "for instance , a poissonian renewal process is a markov process , meaning here that events at all times occur at a constant rate . in this case , @xmath36 , so there the process does not age . for any other distribution , @xmath37 ; yet , if the average waiting time is finite , then on time scales long in comparison to the average waiting time @xmath28 , the renewal process behaves quasi - deterministically ( details below ) .",
    "thus aging is in effect , but becomes negligible at long times .",
    "but scale - free waiting times as in  ( [ intro : tail ] ) result in nontrivial renewal dynamics , with distinct random properties , and aging effects should be taken into careful consideration . in the following section , we thus study and compare in detail the statistics of the renewal",
    "processes @xmath2 and @xmath12 in terms of their probability distributions and discuss the consequences for calculating aged ensemble averages .",
    "several authors have studied the aging renewal process as defined above and its long time approximation , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "we demonstrate here the basic concept of a scaling limit , focusing on the calculation of the rescaled pdf .",
    "the probability @xmath38 of the random number of events @xmath24 taking place up to time @xmath5 takes a simple product form in laplace space @xcite , @xmath39 which is a direct consequence of the renewal property of the process .",
    "it can be read as the probability to count exactly @xmath24 steps at some arbitrary intermediate points in time and not seeing an event ever since , i.e. the expression @xmath40/s$ ] is the laplace transform of @xmath41 .",
    "we also seek to study measurements taken after some time period @xmath32 during which the process evolved unattendedly . to this intent",
    ", we should consider @xmath30 , the number of events that happen during the time interval @xmath1 $ ] .",

    "an intuitive reasoning for this can be given as follows .",
    "a slightly late observer generally has to wait for the forward recurrence time before seeing the first event .",
    "the corrections thus have to account for waiting times which start earlier than the beginning of the observation @xmath32 , but reach far into the observation time window @xmath1 $ ] .",

    "the precise nature of the modifications to the non - aged pdf due to aging can be separated into two aspects . on the one hand ,",
    "the continuous part of the aged pdf , @xmath113 , looses weight to the discrete @xmath76-part with growing age @xmath32 of the counting process .",
