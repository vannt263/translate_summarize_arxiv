    "for a few decades the only way of detecting the @xmath0 meson signal in the intermediate energy proton - proton scattering was to perform the pionic three - prong experiments and finding the characteristic invariant mass . in the cern / hera report",
    "@xcite a compilation of all mutually normalized and otherwise adjusted experimental data for the @xmath5 process from t@xmath6 = 2 gev to t@xmath6 = 13 gev have been presented . yet , first theoretical models @xcite appeared at the beginning of the 90s , accompanied by the first published experimental results @xcite .",
    "the common denominator of these first models is a similar reaction mechanism : the @xmath0 meson in two proton collisions is produced when an intermediate meson , emitted in the meson - production vertex , interacts with a proton forming an @xmath7 resonance which decays into @xmath0 meson and proton .",
    "everything else varies from model to model : the number and type of intermediate mesons ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , ... ) , the type of excited state ( a resonance formation or some re - scattering in addition ) , etc . the contribution of @xmath8 meson exchange is recognized as a dominant one , or at least of equal importance as the @xmath1 meson exchange .",
    "the influence of @xmath0 exchange has been considered as insignificant .",
    "the higher order terms expressed through different forms of initial and final state interactions had to be included , and it has been shown that they play a crucial role for the reliability of the calculation .",
    "the agreement of these models with the experimental data has been obtained by adjusting the free coupling constants .",
    "the new measurements have soon appeared @xcite , and the old models have been improved accordingly @xcite .",
    "the number and type of exchanged mesons still varied .",
    "+   + a model has been proposed @xcite where the meson - nucleon partial - wave t - matrices obtained in the multi - resonance , coupled channel and unitary model @xcite are used in the @xmath0-meson production vertex instead of individual @xmath7 resonances .",
    "the discussion which intermediate mesons dominate the process is reduced to calculating the pp@xmath11 pp@xmath0 process with the predetermined relative strength of the two - body @xmath12-meson production t - matrices for various opened channels .",
    "contrary to former statements , it has been shown that a good agreement with the experimental results for the total cross section is achieved using only @xmath1 and @xmath0 contributions , without any need to invoke heavier mesons .",
    "+   + new low energy experiments reporting angular correlation measurements have been done at j \" ulich @xcite , so theoretical focus has moved from evaluating total cross section to more detailed calculations @xcite .",
    "+   + this article offers an improvement of the previous model @xcite and the extension of the examined energy range .",
    "basic conclusions of the first model are confirmed : the @xmath1 and @xmath0 meson exchange contributions are sufficient for the born term so there is no demonstrable necessity to introduce other meson contributions ; the initial and final state interactions are essential for the shape and size of the cross section .",
    "the new , formerly unreachable conclusions presented in this article are enabled by a more transparent treatment of the initial and final state interactions .",
    "this model reasonably well describes the total cross section for a wide energy range from very near threshold to t@xmath6 = 4.5 gev .",
    "the ingredients of the model are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the differential cross section of the full process is given as : [ lipsxs ] d = f_out f_in dwhere @xmath13 is a standard flux factor and @xmath14 is the three - body lorentz invariant phase space .",
    "the three - particle vertex @xmath15 is completely determined by the bonn potential parameters @xcite , modified by keeping the momenta in the propagator and form factors relativistic .",
    "pseudoscalar meson - proton coupling constants and cut - off parameters , used in this calculation , are identified with the corresponding on mass shell meson - nucleon values from the same reference : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 gev and @xmath19 gev .",
    "eta emission vertex @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 scattering amplitudes from our partial wave analysis @xcite .",
    "off - shell amplitudes have been constructed by keeping the multi resonant @xmath22-matrices on shell and extrapolating partial wave projectors , following the recipe given in @xcite .",
    "the initial and final state correction factors have roots in a threshold transition from the initial two proton @xmath23 state to the final two proton @xmath24 state with the @xmath25 subsystem in the s - state .",
    "the final state correction factor is given in the factorization approximation using the two body jost functions in the low energy effective range approximation @xcite : [ isi , fsi ] f_out= , where two body relative momentum is defined as @xmath26/2 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 as pairs of the final state particles .",
    "the coefficient @xmath29 is a part of our model . allowing the possibility that the scattering length @xmath30 and effective range @xmath31 are complex numbers , the two body correction factor used for the evaluation of final state contribution - eq .",
    "( [ isi , fsi ] ) is , in the s - wave low energy effective range approximation , generically given as : [ fsirelation ] =  , where @xmath32 .    to calculate the jost functions we have used the following @xmath33 scattering length and effective range parameters for the two protons in the @xmath24 state : @xmath34 fm and @xmath35 fm @xcite .    for the @xmath25 @xmath36 subsystem ,",
    "the s - wave scattering length is given by @xmath37 fm @xcite .",
    "for this article , the corresponding effective range @xmath38 fm has been obtained by fitting the @xmath36 wave @xmath22-matrix from the same reference .    for the @xmath23 state ,",
    "the jost function has been estimated by using p - wave effective range relation @xcite .",
    "the used values are @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the initial state factor @xmath43 is indistinguishable from unity for energies above @xmath0 production threshold , while final state correction factor exhibits the distinct variations in magnitude .",
    "we have calculated the born term for this process using the @xmath36 meson - nucleon amplitudes of ref .",
    "@xcite for all three channels : @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and the `` effective '' two body channel .",
    "it turns out that the individual contributions of @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons are comparable in size and slightly dominated by the first one .",
    "the `` effective '' meson contribution is negligible @xcite .",
    "therefore , from now on the third meson contribution ( in which the @xmath8 contribution is implicitly included ) will be disregarded in this work .    to determine the relative sign of the remaining two meson contributions , we have to obtain the qualitative and quantitative agreement of the model predicted total cross section with all experimental data available within the low and intermediate energy range",
    ". we do it in three steps : we calculate the born term contribution ( model a ) , add the @xmath33 final state interaction ( model b ) , and finally include the @xmath44 final state interaction .",
    "we offer two versions of the @xmath44 final state interaction : the full jost function ( @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ isi , fsi ] ) - model c ) , and an arbitrary effective reduction of the final state interaction because of possible double counting in the @xmath0 meson production vertex when the full @xmath22-matrices are used instead of individual n@xmath46 resonances ( @xmath47 in eq .",

    "the comparison of model predictions with the compilation of experimental cross section data for different @xmath1 vs. @xmath0 relative signs is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .    the negative @xmath1 vs. @xmath0 relative sign , as shown in fig.[fig:2 ] , is ruled out .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath33 final state interaction improves the agreement of the model with the experimental data significantly , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . used model for the @xmath44 fsi gives the overall agreement between the model and experiment ( see dashed and full lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) . based on the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we are in favor of model d. however , as the precision of the measured data in the excess energy range of 10 mev @xmath48 100 mev is not adequate ( normalization problems ) , we can only suspect that the double counting effects are hidden in the proposed formalism .",
    "the consecutive addition of individual @xmath36 wave resonances in forming the partial wave @xmath22-matrix is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "results presented in this figure confirm our repeatedly made statement that a single resonance model drastically fails in calculating the total cross section .",
    "we find out that _ only _ the inclusion of _ all three _ resonances reproduces the measured cross section in the considered energy range .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] the higher partial - waves are included into the two - body multi resonant @xmath22-matrices with the intention of obtaining better agreement with experiment at energies higher then q = 100 mev . the inclusion of higher partial - waves into the @xmath49 @xmath22-matrices start to be noticeable only at surprisingly high energies ( above q @xmath50 300 mev ) .",
    "that indicates that the improvement of the present model should be directed to a more rigorous treatment of the initial and final state interaction ( @xmath33 in particular ) prior to the possible improvement of the born term .",
    "additional experiments in the intermediate energy region ( 100 mev @xmath51 q @xmath51 1 gev ) would be greatly appreciated .",
    "proper isi and fsi treatment , along with extending the experimental data set , might increase the reliability of the resonant parameters , the @xmath36 in particular .",
    "we have already determined the ingredients of the model in such a way that the shape and size of the experimental total cross section values are fairly well reproduced .",
    "the angular distributions therefore come out as a prediction . comparing the predictions of model",
    "d with the known experimental values of differential cross sections represent an additional test of understanding the physical nature of the process .",
    "+   +   +    since the final state consists of three particles , one can construct and measure several partially integrated differential cross sections . the @xmath52 system in the final state",
    "is described by 12 variables and 7 of them are fixed by energy - momentum conservation and particle masses .",
    "the differential cross sections with respect to the 5 remaining quantities can be measured .",
    "we have compared the predictions of our model with the experimental values for the angular distribution @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the angle of the @xmath0 momentum in the center - of - mass frame with respect to the beam axis , and the invariant mass distribution @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the proton - proton invariant mass .",
    "measurements of these quantities have been recently reported by calen @xcite at celsius facility for @xmath57 mev , moskal @xcite at cosy-11 for @xmath58 mev , and abdul - bary @xcite @xmath59 mev at cosy tof ( time of flight ) detector .",
    "the abdul - bary @xcite experiment as well gives the value of @xmath55 at the @xmath60 mev .",
    "the differential cross sections with respect to the remaining two variables of interest ( proton-@xmath0 invariant mass and the angle of relative momentum of the proton - proton system to the beam axis ) have been measured , but are not evaluated in this article .",
    "the fifth variable , the azimuthal orientation , is of no significance in the unpolarized measurements .    before we start the comparison we feel compelled to comment the overall agreement of existing experiments . out of three experiments , two of them ( cal ' en @xcite and moskal @xcite ) report quantitative measurements , while the third one ( abdul - bary @xcite ) gives results in arbitrary units only , and normalizes to cal ' en @xcite .",
    "the two quantitative experiments are clearly in strong disagreement at nearby energies : cal ' en at @xmath61  mev @xcite vs. abdul - bary at @xmath62  mev @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to mention that initially reported values of the cosy-11 experiment @xcite are very similar to the cal ' en @xcite .",
    "however , in the currently valid version of the measured data the calibration have been increased by @xmath50 40 % at @xmath63  mev , but remained within the error bar for the @xmath60 mev @xcite .",
    "so , we are left with the situation that we can just compare the shape of differential cross sections paying less importance to the magnitude . disregarding the absolute normalization we see the fair agreement of the shape of the differential cross section for all experiments at @xmath64 mev . at @xmath65",
    "mev some discrepancies remain : the cal ' en @xcite data show the distinct structure in @xmath53 which is missing in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the shape of @xmath55 is notably different in both experiments .",
    "however , the differences remain within error bars .",
    "it is therefore clear that the detailed quantitative comparison of theory and experiment can not be done and that achieving the quantitative agreement awaits for the experimental accordance .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] we show the results of our calculations compared to the world data collection .",
    "the full lines give the comparison of model d predictions with experiment .",
    "the present model nicely reproduces the strong dynamically created departure of both differential cross sections from the symmetric , phase space induced shape .",
    "the agreement in shape and size is good for all energies , with the exception of @xmath66 mev value of moskal ( cosy-11 ) @xcite .",
    "however , if we normalize our model predictions by 35 % ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] - dashed line ) the data are again reproduced very nicely . for the @xmath55 the low @xmath56 peaking",
    "is nicely followed for all three energies , but the more pronounced structure at @xmath67  gev@xmath68 in the abdul - bary data @xcite for @xmath62  mev is not understood .",
    "the same agreement in general trend is achieved for the @xmath53 but the cal ' en structure at @xmath61  mev is not accounted for .",
    "within the framework of the proposed model we show that the single resonance model , using only n(1535 ) , drastically fails to describe the experimental data .",
    "next @xmath36 resonance , n(1650 ) , has to be included in any model to obtain the shape of the total cross section .",
    "the inclusion of the third , controversial , n(2090 ) @xmath36 resonance represents a further improvement .",
    "the inclusion of p - waves is essential for the energies .",
    "all these contributions are effectively incorporated in the proposed model .",
    "the fsi corrections are essential to obtain the qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiment .",
    "the present way how the fsi is treated in this article , namely using only the s - waves for the jost function in the low energy effective range approximation , is enough to understand the data to the present level of experimental precision .",
    "the improvement of the data , the differential cross sections in particular , will require the improvement of the fsi treatment as well .",
