    "the extinction varies from a@xmath0 = 0.9 mag for the diffuse hii regions w3 j and w3 k to very high extinction ( a@xmath0 = 5.9 mag ) towards w3 f. such a sequence in extinction indicates that the stars in the diffuse hii regions have already cleared out their surroundings and destroyed the molecular cloud , while those in uchii regions are still embedded in their parental molecular cloud .",
    "the evolutionary sequence of the hii regions seen in the radio morphology , is consistent with an increase in extinction from the older ( diffuse hii ) regions to the younger ( uchii ) regions .",
