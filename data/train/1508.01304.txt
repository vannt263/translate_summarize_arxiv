    "the hubbard model is a paradigmatic model in the theory of strongly correlated electrons , capturing some of the essential many - body effects due to short - range electronic correlations in condensed matter physics : mott - insulating behavior and the resulting localization of magnetic moments with antiferromagnetic spin correlations .",
    "moreover , the hubbard model is the parent hamiltonian for the heisenberg and t - j model , which describe its low - energy physics in the strongly interacting regime @xcite .",
    "the interest in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) version of the model arises because of the existence of an exact solution based on the bethe ansatz @xcite and its relevance for quasi-1d materials @xcite , nanostructures @xcite and realizations with ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "a recent optical - lattice experiment has investigated the _ non - equilibrium _ charge transport in the two - dimensional hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the 1d repulsive hubbard model is given by @xmath2 with local terms @xmath3 with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) annihilates ( creates ) a fermion with spin @xmath7 on site @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the local density .",
    "@xmath10 is the number of sites , @xmath11 is the hopping matrix element , and @xmath12 denotes the on - site coulomb repulsion .    despite the success of the theory of such integrable systems in computing many equilibrium properties , the quantitative and qualitative understanding of transport within linear response theory",
    "has proven to be a hard problem @xcite . while the zero - temperature transport properties are completely understood ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the main open questions concern transport of charge , spin , or energy at finite temperatures @xmath13 .",
    "the theory of the algebraic structure of the bethe ansatz provides knowledge of local conservation laws , which can give rise to ballistic transport @xcite .",
    "this ballistic transport is usually described via the drude weight @xmath14 , the zero - frequency contribution in the real part of the conductivity @xmath15 , @xmath16 as was argued by zotos , naef , and prelovek @xcite , a finite drude weight exists if a lower bound is obtained from the mazur inequality @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the thermodynamic average at temperature @xmath19 .",
    "such a bound exists if at least one conserved charge @xmath20 has a finite overlap with the current operator @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 are commonly ordered by their range , @xmath23 corresponding to particle number @xmath24 and @xmath25 corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 has range three ( i.e. , @xmath28 involves operators acting on three neighboring sites ) and has the same structure as the energy - current operator , yet the two differ in the prefactor of one term @xcite . as a consequence , thermal transport in the one - dimensional hubbard model",
    "is ballistic at any finite temperature @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that there are also quasi - local conserved quantities in bethe - ansatz integrable systems which can be crucial for some transport channels @xcite . using the mazur inequality ,",
    "one obtains a non - zero drude weight for charge transport for any filling @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the number of fermions ) _ other _ than @xmath31 , from considering only the leading non - trivial local conserved charge @xmath27 of range three . the case of half filling has been discussed controversially , with some studies arguing in favor of a finite charge drude weight @xmath32 @xcite while others provided evidence for a vanishing @xmath33 @xcite or at best a very small @xmath14 @xcite in the thermodynamic limit ( tdmrg gives a small upper bound to the drude weight ) .",
    "the situation thus appears to be similar to spin transport in the spin-1/2 xxz chain at zero magnetization , where also no local conservation law yields a non - zero bound to the spin drude weight @xcite , while numerical results @xcite and bethe - ansatz based calculations @xcite strongly indicate a nonzero spin drude weight at least in its gapless phase , with the possible exception of the point of full su(2 ) symmetric exchange , i.e. , the heisenberg chain . for that model ,",
    "though , quasi - local conservation laws have ultimately been identified as being at the heart of the ballistic spin transport @xcite at zero magnetization and in its gapless phase .",
    "the connection between ( quasi-)local conservation laws and ballistic transport is closely related to how such conservation laws affect thermalization in integrable systems @xcite .",
    "consider a quantum quench in which the force driving the current is turned off .",
    "if this initial condition leads to a finite value of @xmath34 , then the current will never completely decay back to zero .",
    "a simple example is the quench of a flux piercing a ring , which has been studied in this context @xcite .    besides the question of the ( divergent ) zero - frequency contribution ,",
    "the actual frequency dependence of the optical conductivity @xmath35 constitutes an equally interesting problem @xcite .",
    "some insight can be gained from effective low - energy theories such as bosonization @xcite , which is , however , limited to very low temperatures and may not correctly capture effects due to integrability without fine - tuning of parameters .",
    "an exact diagonalization study observed strong anomalous finite - size effects in @xmath35 of integrable mott insulators @xcite , while many studies conclude that the dc conductivity @xmath36 is nonzero in such systems @xcite .",
    "a recent density matrix renormalization group study suggests a generic divergence of @xmath37 at low temperatures with @xmath38 @xcite , different from the fermi - liquid behavior @xmath39 that emerge in sufficiently high dimensions @xcite . for the high - temperature regime , a lower bound for the diffusion constant",
    "@xmath40 has been derived @xcite , reading @xmath41 ( note that @xmath42 . )",
    "while our primary interest is in the behavior in the linear response regime , we mention that numerical simulations of boundary - driven transport through open hubbard chains also indicate diffusive high - temperature transport @xcite .    in our work",
    ", we revisit the problem of charge transport in the hubbard chain at half filling by employing the method of dynamical quantum typicality ( dqt ) .",
    "basically , this approach uses single pure states that are constructed to yield _ typical _ thermal behavior at finite temperature to compute the time dependence of correlation functions . in the current context of transport , this method has recently been applied to the calculation of the spin drude weight in xxz chains @xcite and to transport in various non - integrable models @xcite . since only a pure state needs to be propagated in the dqt method , any means of propagating the wave function such as a forward integration or krylov - space based approaches",
    "can be used , giving access to system sizes as large as @xmath43 , which is comparable to what can be reached for the ground state via lanczos methods .",
    "we extract the drude weight from the long - time behavior of current autocorrelation functions and study its finite - size dependence .",
    "we observe a power - law decay with system size to zero , which we interpret in the framework of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis applied to integrable systems @xcite .",
    "thus , our results confirm the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , a vanishing drude weight @xmath33 at finite temperatures .",
    "we further analyze the optical conductivity , for which our data suggest a finite @xmath44 .",
    "depending on how the time - dependent data are converted to frequency , one either recovers the anomalous , system - size dependent fluctuations discussed in @xcite or one obtains a smooth , diffusive - like low - frequency dependence .",
    "the hubbard model can equivalently be formulated as a spin-1/2 model defined on a two - leg ladder : spin - up and spin - down fermions live on the two separate legs , where the exchange is of @xmath45 type along the legs , while on the rungs the hubbard interaction translates into an ising interaction .",
    "this reformulation is , on the one hand , useful for numerical implementations , and on the other hand , there are several natural ways of breaking the integrability that emerge in this picture . transport in various spin hamiltonians defined on spin ladders has in fact been intensely investigated @xcite .    here , we consider the _ mass - imbalanced _ hubbard model as an example of a non - integrable system .",
    "the local hamiltonian now takes the form : @xmath46 + { u}(n_{l,\\uparrow}- \\frac{1}{2})(n_{l,\\downarrow}-\\frac{1}{2 } ) \\,,\\ ] ] i.e. , we introduce different hopping matrix elements @xmath47 , @xmath48 , for the two fermionic species .",
    "we define the inverse mass ratio as @xmath49 in the limit of @xmath50 , also known as falicov - kimball model , one naturally obtains perfectly insulating behavior at any temperature due to an effective anderson - localization mechanism . in this case , all the local density operators @xmath51 of the heavy species become conserved quantities , i.e. , @xmath52 .",
    "thus , for a given random distribution of immobile spin - down fermions , via the interaction term @xmath53 , one effectively obtains a diagonal disorder potential for the light fermions with local potentials @xmath54 drawn from a binary distribution @xmath55 .",
    "the translational invariance of the original model at a given density of @xmath56 is restored by averaging over many random distributions of the heavy fermions .",
    "we are interested in the dependence of the conductivities @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the heavy and light species , respectively , as a function of the inverse mass ratio @xmath59 .",
    "first , we compute the associated drude weights , which vanish approximately exponentially fast with system size , as expected for a non - integrable model @xcite . for intermediate values of @xmath59",
    ", we observe a regular form of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the dc conductivity of the heavy component appears to simply vanish quadratically with @xmath60 , while the presence of the heavy fermions leads to an approximately exponential decay of the dc conductivity of the light fermions as a function of decreasing @xmath59 , which we are able to resolve for @xmath1 .",
    "the mass - imbalanced hubbard model has recently attracted renewed interest in the context of many - body localization @xcite since several authors have considered the possibility of many - body localization in translationally invariant systems @xcite . in our model ,",
    "interactions could thus potentially lead to a non - trivial effect in the strongly mass - imbalanced regime .",
    "recent work has suggested , though , that there likely is no mass - imbalance driven localization - delocalization transition in our model at a nonzero @xmath59 , but a quasi many - body localized behavior with anomalous diffusion at small values of @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "these results are based on exact diagonalization with @xmath61 .",
    "our results suggest a finite , albeit exponentially small dc conductivity at least for @xmath1 .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "section  [ sec : def ] summarizes the definitions and expressions of the conductivity , the drude weight , and current autocorrelation functions . in section  [ sec : dyntyp ] , we provide a brief introduction to the dqt method and its application to the calculation of finite - temperature current autocorrelation functions",
    ". section  [ sec : hubbard ] contains our results for the integrable hubbard chain at half filling , while we present our data and the discussion of the mass - imbalanced model in sec .",
    "[ sec : mass ] .",
    "we conclude with a summary and an outlook in sec .  [",
    "sec : sum ] .",
    "using the jordan - wigner transformation , the mass - imbalanced fermi - hubbard model can equivalently be formulated as a spin-@xmath62 model defined on a two - leg ladder , @xmath63 where spin - up and spin - down fermions live on the two separate legs and the hubbard interaction translates into an ising interaction .",
    "our numerical implementation is formulated in the spin language .",
    "we derive the charge current from the continuity equation @xcite , leading to @xmath64 and @xmath65 $ ] in the hubbard notation . in the spin notation , @xmath66 is the spin current in the first ( @xmath67 ) or second ( @xmath68 ) leg .",
    "we correspondingly study the two current autocorrelation functions at inverse temperature @xmath69 @xmath70 where the time argument of @xmath71 refers to the heisenberg picture , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 in the high - temperature limit @xmath74 .    from the time dependence of @xmath75",
    "we determine the quantities @xmath76 in a time interval @xmath77 $ ] where @xmath75 has decayed to its long - time value @xmath78 and is practically constant .",
    "thus , the quantities @xmath79 approximate the finite - size drude weights of the two legs given by @xmath80 we determine the frequency - dependent optical conductivity @xmath81 via the finite - time fourier transformation @xmath82 here , the choice of a particular @xmath83 implies a frequency resolution @xmath84 . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath85",
    ", @xmath86 is a smooth function on an arbitrarily small scale @xmath87 and does not depend on the actual value of @xmath83 chosen , as long as it is large compared to the current relaxation time @xcite . for any finite @xmath10 ,",
    "however , it is important to find a reasonable @xmath88 where finite - size effects are well controlled . in particular , for integrable systems , finding such a @xmath83 can be a subtle issue , as discussed later in detail .",
    "note that , to leading order in @xmath89 , @xmath90 and that @xmath91 in the high - temperature limit .",
    "if we find a @xmath92 ) region with no significant dependence on @xmath83 and @xmath10 , we extract the dc conductivity @xmath93 as the low - frequency limit @xmath94 in case of vanishing drude weights , @xmath95 is identical to the time - dependent diffusion constant @xmath96 with @xmath97 being the static susceptibility and reading , at @xmath74 , @xmath98 in the case of significant finite - size drude weights , however , @xmath99 may not depend on @xmath83 and @xmath10 , while @xmath100 clearly does .",
    "therefore , in such cases , the time - dependent diffusion constant provides a useful alternative for extracting transport coefficients on the basis of finite systems . beyond technical aspects",
    ", @xmath101 also has a clear physical interpretation : it directly yields information on how spatial variances of density profiles evolve in time @xcite for any finite @xmath10 .",
    "in this section we first introduce a very accurate approximation of current autocorrelation functions .",

    "( [ acf ] ) by a single scalar product @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a single pure state drawn at random .",

    "these coefficients are chosen according to a gaussian distribution with zero mean .",
