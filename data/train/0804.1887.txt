    "local regularity and multifractal analysis have become unavoidable issues in the past years .",
    "indeed , physical phenomena exhibiting wild local regularity properties have been discovered in many contexts ( turbulence flows , intensity of seismic waves , traffic analysis , .. ) . from a mathematical viewpoint , the multifractal approach is also a fruitful source of interesting problems .",
    "consequently , there is a strong need for a better theoretical understanding of the so - called multifractal behaviors . in this article",
    ", we investigate the relations between multifractal properties and time subordination for continuous functions .    the most common functions or processes used to model irregular phenomena are monofractal , in the sense that they exhibit the same local regularity at each point .",
    "let us recall how the local regularity of a function is measured .",
    "let @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath1 is said to belong to @xmath8 if there are a polynomial @xmath9 of degree less than @xmath10 $ ] and a constant @xmath11 such that , locally around @xmath12 , latexmath:[\\[\\label{defpoint }    exponent of @xmath1 at @xmath12 is @xmath14    the singularity spectrum of @xmath1 is then defined by @xmath15 ( @xmath16 stands for the hausdorff dimension , and @xmath17 by convention ) .    hence , a function @xmath0 is said to be monofractal with exponent @xmath18 when @xmath19 for every @xmath20 . for monofractal functions",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath21 , while @xmath22 for @xmath23 . sample paths of brownian motions or fractional brownian motions are known to be almost surely monofractal with exponents less than 1 . for reasons that appear below , * we focus on monofractal functions associated with an exponent @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "*    more complex models had to be used and/or developed , for at least three reasons : the occurrence of intermittence phenomena ( mainly in fluid mechanics ) , the presence of oscillating patterns ( for instance in image processing ) , or the presence of discontinuities ( in finance or telecommunications ) .",
    "such models may have multifractal properties , in the sense that the support of their singularity spectrum is not reduced to a single point . among these processes ,",
    "whose local regularity varies badly from one point to another , let us mention mandelbrot multiplicative cascades and their extensions @xcite , ( generalized ) multifractional brownian motions @xcite and lvy processes @xcite ( for discontinuous phenomena ) .",
    "starting from a monofractal process as above in dimension 1 , a simple and efficient way to get a more elaborate process is to compose it with a time subordinator , i.e. an increasing function or process .",
    "mandelbrot , for instance , showed the pertinency of time subordination in the study of financial data @xcite . from a theoretical viewpoint",
    ", it is also challenging to understand how the multifractal properties of a function are modified after a time change  @xcite .",
    "a natural question is to understand the differences between the multifractal processes above and compositions of monofractal functions with multifractal subordinators .",
    "a function @xmath0 is said to be the composition of a monofractal function with a time subordinator ( cmt ) when @xmath1 can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is monofractal with exponent @xmath27 and @xmath28 is an increasing homeomorphism of @xmath4 .    in this article , we prove that if a continuous function @xmath0 has a `` homogeneous multifractal '' behavior ( in a sense we define just below ) , then @xmath1 is cmt . hence , @xmath1 is the composition of a monofractal function with a time subordinator , and shall simply be viewed as a complication of a monofractal model .",
    "this yields a deeper insight into the understanding of multifractal behaviors of continuous functions , and gives a more important role to the multifractal analysis of positive borel measures ( which are derivatives of time subordinators ) .",
    "we explain in section [ self ] and [ multi ] how this decomposition can be used to compute the singularity spectrum of the function @xmath1 .",
    "let us begin with two cases where a function @xmath1 is obviously cmt :    \\1",
    ". if @xmath1 is the integral of any positive borel measure @xmath29 , then @xmath30 , where the identity @xmath31 is monofractal and @xmath1 is increasing .",
    "remark that in this case , @xmath1 may even have exponents greater than 1 .",
    "any monofractal function @xmath32 can be written @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is monofractal and @xmath35 is undoubtably an homeomorphism of @xmath4 .",
    "these two simple cases will be met again below .    to bring general answers to our problem and thus to exhibit another class of cmt functions , we develop an approach based on the oscillations of a function @xmath36 .",
    "for every subinterval @xmath37 , consider the oscillations of order 1 of @xmath1 on @xmath38 defined by @xmath39 * in the sequel , we assume that @xmath1 is continuous and for every non - trivial subinterval @xmath38 of @xmath4 , @xmath40 . * this entails that @xmath1 is nowhere locally constant , which is a natural assumption for the results we are looking for .",
    "it is very classical that the oscillations of order 1 characterize precisely the pointwise hlder exponents strictly less than 1 ( see section [ prel ] ) .",
    "let us introduce the quantity that will be the basis of our construction .    for every @xmath41 , @xmath42 , we consider the dyadic intervals @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 , the union being disjoint .",
    "for every @xmath41 and @xmath42 , for simplicity we set @xmath45(@xmath46 since @xmath1 is @xmath47 ) .",
    "for every @xmath41 , let @xmath48 be the unique real number such that @xmath49 we then define the intrinsic monofractal exponent of @xmath1 @xmath50 as @xmath51    this quantity @xmath50 characterizes the asymptotic maximal values of the oscillations of @xmath1 on the whole interval @xmath4 .",
    "this exponent is the core of our theorem , because it gives an upper limit to the maximal time distortions we are allowed to apply .",
    "it is satisfactory that @xmath50 has a functional interpretation . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath1 can be decomposed as ( [ decomp ] ) , then the exponent of the monofractal function @xmath2 shall not depend on the oscillation approach nor on the dyadic basis . in section [ secgen ]",
    "we explain that @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are respectively the besov space and _ oscillation space _ on the open interval @xmath55 ( see jaffard in @xcite for instance ) .    for multifractal functions @xmath1",
    "satisfying some multifractal formalism , the exponent @xmath50 can also be read on the singularity spectrum of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed ( see section [ secgen ] ) , @xmath50 corresponds to the inverse of the largest possible slope of a straight line going through 0 and tangent to the singularity spectrum @xmath56 of @xmath1 .",
    "these remarks are important to have an idea _ a priori _ of the monofractal exponent of @xmath2 in the decomposition @xmath57 .",
    "they also give an intrinsic formula for @xmath50 .",
    "let us come back to the two simple examples above :    \\1 .",
    "for the integral @xmath1 of any positive measure @xmath29 , @xmath58 , hence @xmath59 , which corresponds to the monofractal exponent of the identity @xmath60 from the oscillations viewpoint .",
    "the first difficulties arise for the monofractal functions @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath32 is monofractal of exponent @xmath61 , then we do nt have necessarily @xmath62 .",
    "we always have @xmath63 ( see lemma [ lem0 ] in section [ prel ] ) , but it is always possible to construct wild counter - examples .",
    "nevertheless , we treat in details the examples of the weierstrass functions and the sample paths of ( fractional ) brownian motions in section [ mono ] , for which the exponent @xmath64 meets our requirements .",
    "unfortunately , the knowledge of @xmath50 is not sufficient to get relevant results .",
    "for instance , consider a function @xmath1 that has two different monofractal behaviors on @xmath65 and @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "such an @xmath1 can be obtained as the continuous juxtaposition of two weierstrass function with distinct exponents @xmath67 : we have @xmath68 , and @xmath1 can not be written as the composition of a monofractal function with a time subordinator .",
    "this is a consequence of lemma [ lemmonof ] , which asserts that two monofractal functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 of disctinct exponents @xmath71 and @xmath72 never verify @xmath73 for any continuous increasing function @xmath28 ( indeed , such an @xmath3 would `` dilate '' time everywhere , which is impossible ) .",
    "we need to introduce a homogeneity condition * c1 * to get rid of these annoying and artificial cases .",
    "this condition heuristically imposes that the oscillations of any restriction of @xmath1 to a subinterval of @xmath4 have the same asymptotic properties as the oscillations of @xmath1 on @xmath4 .",
    "* condition * c1 * : * + let @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath76 be the function @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the canonical affine contraction which maps @xmath4 to @xmath79 .",
    "condition * c1 * is satisfied for @xmath1 when there is a real number @xmath18 such that for every @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath80 .",
    "hence @xmath76 is a renormalized version of the restriction of @xmath1 to the interval @xmath79 .",
    "remark that @xmath81 does not depend on the normalization factor @xmath82 .",
    "although self - similar functions are good candidates to satisfy * c1 * , a function @xmath1 fulfilling this condition does not need at all to possess such a property . in order to guarantee that @xmath1 is cmt , we strengthen the convergence toward @xmath81 .",
    "* condition * c2 * : * + assume that condition * c1 * is fulfilled .",
    "there are two positive sequences @xmath83 and @xmath84 and two real numbers @xmath85 with the following property :    1 .",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath84 are positive non - increasing sequences that converge to zero , and @xmath86 for some @xmath87 .",
    "2 .   for every @xmath74 and @xmath88",
    ", the sequence @xmath89 converges to @xmath90 ( it is not only a liminf , it is a limit ) with the following convergence rate : for every @xmath91 $ ] , @xmath92    assuming that @xmath93 is a limit is of course a constraint , but not limiting in practice , since this condition holds for most of the interesting functions or ( almost surely ) for most of the sample paths of processes .",
    "similarly , the decreasing behavior ( [ eq1 ] ) is not very restrictive : such a behavior is somehow expected for a @xmath94 function .",
    "the convergence speed ( [ eq1 ] ) is a more important constraint , but the convergence rate we impose on @xmath83 toward 0 is extremely slow , and is realized in the most common cases , as shown below .",
    "[ maintheo ] let @xmath95 be a continuous function .",
    "assume that @xmath1 satisfies * c1 * and * c2*.    then @xmath1 is cmt and the function @xmath2 in ( [ decomp ] ) is monofractal of exponent @xmath50 .",
    "such a decomposition is of course not unique : if @xmath1 is cmt and @xmath96 is @xmath97 and strictly increasing , then @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is still a monofractal function of exponent @xmath100 and @xmath101 is an increasing function .    nevertheless , if two decompositions ( [ decomp ] ) exist respectively with functions @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , then @xmath69 and @xmath70 are necessarily monofractal with the same exponent @xmath50 .",
    "this is again a consequence of lemma [ lemmonof ] .",
    "an important consequence of theorem [ maintheo ] is that the ( possibly ) multifractal behavior of @xmath1 is contained in the multifractal behavior of @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , since @xmath3 is an increasing continuous function from @xmath4 to @xmath4 , @xmath3 is the integral of a positive measure , say @xmath29 , on @xmath4 .",
    "the local regularity of @xmath29 is classically quantified through a local dimension exponent defined for every @xmath104 by @xmath105 where @xmath106 stands for the ball ( here an interval ) with center @xmath107 and radius @xmath108 , and @xmath109 is the diameter of the set @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) .",

    "as a conclusion , theorem [ maintheo ] increases the role of the multifractal analysis of measures , since for the functions satisfying * c1 * and * c2 * , their multifractal behavior is ruled exclusively by the behavior of @xmath29 .    as an application of theorem [ maintheo ]",
