    "piezoelectric lead - zirconate - titanate [ pb(zr@xmath8ti@xmath9)o@xmath2 , pzt ] solid solution system was developed over 40 years ago yet attempts to understand its properties continue to trigger new studies .",
    "a long - lasting view is that when @xmath10 is approximately 0.52 , a first - order phase transition occurs between tetragonal and rhombohedral phases , resulting in two - phase co - existence .",
    "the electromechanical properties peak slightly on the rhombohedral side of the phase boundary . in the composition - temperature plane",
    "the boundary ( commonly called as the morphotropic phase boundary , mpb ) is nearly independent of temperature , thus making pzt very practical material for applications @xcite .",
    "the commonly offered reasoning for the exceptionally good electromechanical coupling is based on the idea that there are eight ( rhombohedral phase ) and six ( tetragonal phase ) spontaneous polarization directions available in the two - phase system so that the system can readily respond to external electric field or stress .",
    "the space group symmetries given for a disordered solid - solution should be taken as average symmetries from which short - range order deviates .",
    "for instance , it has been known for long that raman scattering data can not be explained by the average symmetries .",
    "the high - temperature cubic phase has no first - order raman modes yet experiments revealed that spectra collected on pzt above the curie temperature have rather strong features at energies close to the low - temperature first - order phonon energies . in the case of so - called relaxor ferroelectrics this type of behavior is normal and the frequently offered explanation is that symmetry - lowering defects generate polar nanoregions ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "also the low - temperature raman spectra of ti - rich pzt have many features which are not consistent with the tetragonal symmetry : the twofold degenerate @xmath11-symmetry modes of the tetragonal pzt were split , indicating that the symmetry is lower than @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "raman experiments showed that anharmonicity plays a significant role in lead titanate , the anharmonic contribution being increased with increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "the traditional view was modified once high - resolution x - ray synchrotron studies revealed that the phase believed to be tetragonal possesses monoclinic distortion @xcite in the vicinity of the mpb .",
    "neutron powder diffraction experiments , able to resolve the monoclinic split @xcite , ruled out octahedral tilts , and verified the @xmath4 symmetry @xcite .",
    "accurate modeling of the system requires not only the consideration of the unit cell but also crystallographic twins ( or ferroelectric domains ) and grain boundaries must be taken into account . in piezoelectric ceramics",
    "the response to external stress or electric field can be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic contributions @xcite .",
    "the former is essentially a single crystal response ( i.e. is formed by the ion displacements within a primitive cell of the crystal ) , whereas the latter covers the contribution due to grain boundaries , preferred orientation or texture of the grains , i.e. ferroelectric domains within the grains , and changes in crystal phase fractions .",
    "since the full model considering contributions from atomic scale up to the macroscopic grain size scale is very complex , experimental studies have commonly been applied to gain deeper insight .",
    "non-180@xmath12 domain switching ( i.e. , contributing to the extrinsic contribution ) gives rise to approximately 34% of the measured @xmath13 coefficient of pzt @xcite .",
    "the extrinsic contribution can be larger or smaller if the domain wall motion is respectively made easier or more difficult by doping @xcite .",
    "a study of the domain switching showed that the 90@xmath12 domains in single phase tetragonal phase ( titanium rich pzt ) hardly switch , whereas the domains in the two - phase region switch @xcite .",
    "texture and strain analysis of the ferroelastic behavior of pb(zr@xmath14ti@xmath15)o@xmath2 by in - situ neutron diffraction technique showed that the rhombohedral phase plays a significant role in the macroscopic electromechanical behavior of this material @xcite .",
    "the domain nucleation and domain wall propagation are central factors limiting the speed of ferroelectric polarization switching @xcite .",
    "an important intrinsic contribution to the piezoelectricity is due to the increase of certain piezoelectric constants once the phase transition is approached .",
    "this increase was predicted to be significant in the vicinity of the pressure - induced phase transition in lead titanate @xcite .",
    "the computations carried out for lead titanate further show that it is the competition between two factors which determines the morphotropic phase boundary @xcite .",
    "the first is the oxygen octahedral tilting , favoring the rhombohedral @xmath3 phase , and the second is the entropy , which in the vicinity of the morphotropic phase boundary favors the tetragonal phase above 130 k. if the two factors are in balance over a large temperature range , a steep phase boundary results in the pressure - temperature plane which is desirable for applications .",
    "the advantageous feature of the @xmath3 phase is its ability to be compressed efficiently by tilting the oxygen octahedra , in contrast to symmetries prohibiting oxygen octahedral tilting @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 phase , whose hexagonal unit cell is shown in panel ( a ) , and the @xmath4 phase , panel ( b ) , behave very differently under applied pressure .",
    "the @xmath16 ratio between the oxygen octahedral and cuboctahedra - volumes of the @xmath3 phase decreases with increasing pressure : the crystal is contracting and thus the @xmath7 cations ( which fit oxygen octahedra tightly ) have to take larger relative volume from the total volume ( from the cuboctahedra , which has excess of space for pb ) by tilting oxygen octahedra .",
    "the symmetry prohibits this mechanism in the @xmath5 and @xmath4 phases .",
    "density - functional theory computations predict that @xmath5 has an entropy term benefit at elevated temperatures .",
    "two rhombohedral ( corresponding to the @xmath17 phase ) pseudocubic cells are shown by dotted lines in panel ( a ) . due to the octahedral tilting , indicated by arrows , the two cells are not equivalent : the tilting corresponds to the @xmath18 symmetry lowering . the primitive cell of the @xmath4 phase is shown by dotted lines in panel ( b ) .",
    "structure figure was prepared by the vesta software @xcite.,width=491 ]    we briefly summarize the relationship between the structural parameters and polyhedral tilts and volumes , given in ref .",

    "now , the octahedral tilt angle is given by @xmath22 and the polyhedral volume ratio @xmath16 is equal to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is given by equation @xmath25 .",
    "the present study focuses on the two - phase , @xmath4 and @xmath3 , pzt ceramic material , pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath1)o@xmath2 , which has a composition slightly on the zr - rich side of the morphotropic phase boundary .",
    "the main goal was to determine the phase fractions and structural parameters as a function of applied pressure and temperature .",
    "also the question concerning the reversibility of the structural properties of pzt is addressed .",
    "to address the possible homogeneity differences due to the variation in solid - state reaction based sample preparation method lead zirconate - titanate powders were prepared using different starting oxides and sintering conditions . in the first route",
    "the pbo , zro@xmath26 and tio@xmath26 oxides were mechanically mixed in desired proportions , whereas in the second method pbtio@xmath2 and pbzro@xmath2 powders were used as starting chemicals .",
    "the phase purity and crystal structure were checked by x - ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy measurements .",
    "no significant differences were observed and thus a sample prepared through the latter method was used for the experiments .",
    "samples were annealed by first forming perovskite structure at 1073 k ( 30 minutes ) , then increasing the temperature to 1373 k ( 60 minutes ) to improve the sample homogeneity and then cooling the sample first to a stepwise manner to room temperature .",
    "annealing times were kept rather short in order to limit pbo loss .",
    "high - pressure neutron powder diffraction experiments were carried out at the los alamos neutron scattering center using the tap-98 toroidal anvil press @xcite set on the high - pressure - preferred orientation ( hippo ) diffractometer @xcite .",
    "pressure was generated using the high - pressure anvil cells .",
    "sodium chloride was used as a pressure calibrant material . to minimize deviatoric stress built up during room - temperature compression on the polycrystalline sample ,",
    "all data in our high p - t neutron - diffraction experiment were collected during the cooling cycle from 800 k at each desired loading pressure .",
    "data were collected between 300 and 800 k as a function of pressure .",
    "rietveld refinements were carried out using the program general structure analysis system ( gsas ) @xcite and expgui @xcite .",
    "the pressure was estimated from the reflection positions of the nacl phase through the equation of state @xcite . at higher pressures it was necessary to include the reflections from the diamond anvils in the refinement model .",
    "the broad hump seen in the background intensity between 2 and 3  is due to the diffuse scattering from the amorphous zirconium phophate gasket and was modelled using the diffuse scattering option available in the gsas software .",
