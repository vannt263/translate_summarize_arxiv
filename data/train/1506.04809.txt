    "many - body effects in solids are commonly explored either by hamiltonians which include explicit electron - electron interactions , _ e.g.  _ the hubbard or periodic anderson models , or else by hamiltonians containing interactions of free electrons with other ( quantum spin or phonon ) degrees of freedom , _ e.g.  _ the kondo or holstein models , respectively .",
    "the distinction between these two descriptions is not completely sharp the kondo model is a large @xmath3 limit of the periodic anderson model , for example . even more generally , the introduction of auxiliary fields allows the mapping of hamiltonians with direct electron - electron interactions to free fermions coupled to a ` hubbard - stratonovich ' field . in all these cases ,",
    "the quantum spin , phonon , or hubbard - stratonovich variables depend on both space and imaginary time .    suppressing the imaginary time dependence represents an approximation to including the full effect of quantum fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , many of the interesting effects of electronic interactions can still be studied in this regime .",
    "this approximation has been motivated , for example , in cases where large (  classical \" ) core spins are coupled to an itinerant electron band , a situation which occurs in the double perovskite sr@xmath4femoo@xmath5 where the 3d@xmath6 configuration of fe@xmath7 forms a spin-5/2 with which the mo electron interacts @xcite .",
    "similarly , applications of classical spin - fermion models to a broad class of materials including nickelates@xcite , cuprate superconductors@xcite , and iron superconductors@xcite , have been reported , with the elucidation of subtle many body effects including magnetic and charge domain formation , and site - selective mott transitions . in these materials , the coupling of an itinerant electron band to classical degrees of freedom",
    "is argued to capture the quantum mechanics of fast electronic motion in contact with the slower degrees of freedom , much in the spirit of the born - oppenheimer approximation or the car - parrinello method@xcite .    in a technically similar spirit of treating interactions by a simplified time independent variable that leaves the electronic problem quadratic ,",
    "proximity induced superconductivity can be described by a pairing field bilinear in fermion operators@xcite .",
    "the combined effects of frozen spin and pairing configurations lead to many interesting features including topological superconductivity and majorana states@xcite .",
    "the realizations of spin - fermion models described above have largely concerned tight binding hamiltonians where the electrons move on a lattice .",
    "very recently , the approach was also applied to a gas of fermions moving in the continuum in one dimension , but coupled to a regular array of classical spins@xcite .",
    "the itinerant electrons mediate a ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky)@xcite interaction .",
    "the goal of the work was to determine the ground state phase diagram in the plane of the exchange coupling between the classical and electron spins and the electron density , and explore the possibility of spiral spin states driving one dimensional superconductors into topological phases@xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the lattice version of this problem ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we show that , similar to the continuum case , ferromagnetism ( f ) occurs at low filling and is replaced by a spiral configuration of classical spins , which minimizes the energy only when the exchange constant @xmath0 is smaller than roughly half the bandwidth w. the spiral phase gives way to commensurate antiferromagnetic ( af ) order as @xmath0 increases .",
    "one central observation of our work is that near half - filling and at a fixed electron density , the system phase separates into a half - filled af phase and a spiral phase of reduced ( less than half - filling ) or enhanced ( greater than half - filling ) density at weak coupling @xmath8 .",
    "we show that this spiral - af phase separation initially survives in the presence of a weak pairing field @xmath1 , but for larger @xmath1 the transition becomes continuous .",

    "phase emerges .",

    "1d classical heisenberg spins with power law interactions also have long range order at finite temperature for @xmath24 but no transition for @xmath25@xcite , which suggests that , in principle , the @xmath26 rkky long range interaction could result in spin ordering at @xmath27 in one dimension .",

    "<S> , the system phase separates into a half - filled antiferromagnetic phase and a spiral phase . </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetic phases are shown to be fully polarized , while the spiral phases have equal admixture of up and down spins . </S>",
    "<S> phase separation survives in the presence of weak pairing field @xmath1 but disappears when @xmath1 exceeds a critical value @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> if pairing fields are large enough , an additional spiral state arises at strong coupling @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of this study , especially the phase separation , to artificially engineered systems of adjacent itinerant electrons and localized spins is discussed . in particular , we propose a method which might allow for the braiding of majorana fermions by changing the density and moving their location as they are pulled along by a phase separation boundary . </S>"
