    "hamiltonian lattice or quasi - discrete systems have become popular in the last few years , to a considerable extent due to experimental implementations of such systems drawn from various branches of physics .",
    "one of the first examples where such developments became relevant was in the nonlinear optics of fabricated algaas waveguide arrays @xcite . there , the interplay of inherent discreteness and nonlinearity led to the emergence of numerous interesting phenomena including peierls - nabarro potential barriers , diffraction and diffraction management @xcite , gap solitons @xcite , and so on ( see also the reviews @xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand , more recently another area of nonlinear optics that has been central to the development of both theoretical as well as of computational tools to study such systems ,",
    "has been the setting of optically induced photonic lattices in photorefractive crystals such as sbn . there",
    ", the original theoretical proposal of these lattices @xcite was susbequently followed by experimental realizations @xcite , paving the way for the observation of a diverse array of novel and interesting phenomena in such crystals .",
    "these include the formation of patterns such as dipole @xcite , quadrupole @xcite and necklace @xcite solitons , impurity modes @xcite , discrete vortices @xcite , rotary solitons @xcite , higher order bloch modes @xcite and gap vortices @xcite , the observation of two - dimensional ( 2d ) bloch oscillations and landau - zener tunneling @xcite , the observation of localization and diffraction in honeycomb @xcite , hexagonal @xcite and quasi - crystalline lattices @xcite , and most recently the study of anderson localization in disordered photonic lattices @xcite ( for a review of some of this activity see , e.g. , refs .",
    "finally , we should note that similar dynamical lattices have also become of interest in an entirely different area of physics , namely the atomic physics of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , when trapped in periodic potentials ; see , e.g. , the recent reviews @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will focus , in particular , on the recently emerging area of _ non - square _ lattices in waveguide arrays , as well as in light induced photonic crystals , @xcite .",
    "such lattices were also considered earlier from a theoretical perspective in discrete settings corresponding to waveguide arrays @xcite .",
    "we will study here the existence , stability and dynamical properties of multi - pulse solitary wave structures , as well as of discrete vortex structures in both hexagonal and honeycomb lattices .",
    "we will focus on two prototypical contours of such lattices .",
    "namely , a more extended six - site contour , as well as a reduced three - site contour , both depicted in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] . our prototypical model of interest will be the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation and our results will be presented for the case of a focusing nonlinearity ; however , our findings can be directly transformed to the case of a defocusing nonlinearity .",
    "additionally , we should note that similar results can be obtained in klein - gordon models and have been illustrated , e.g. , for three - site contours in hexagonal lattices @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to note that crystalline configurations of strongly coupled doped plasmas ( dusty plasma crystals ) occur in the form of 1d or 2d monolayers formed in low - temperature gas discharge experiments @xcite .",
    "interestingly , such dust crystals generically appear as spontaneously formed hexagonal 2d arrangements @xcite , although alternative configurations also include honeycomb 2d lattices @xcite and 1d dust chains ( when appropriate trapping potentials are used for lateral confinement @xcite ) .",
    "a discrete klein - gordon description has recently been employed to model the dynamics of transverse vibrations of dust grains in dusty plasma crystals , both in 1d @xcite and in hexagonal 2d dust lattices @xcite .",
    "the key findings that we report here are the following :    * for the focusing nonlinearities considered herein , in a six - site honeycomb / hexagonal contour , topological charge @xmath2 configurations may be stable , while @xmath3 ones can never be stable .",
    "this represents a notable qualitative difference from the results in the case of a square lattice @xcite , where the prototypical contour consisting of four sites features a potentially stable @xmath3 vortex , as well as a genuine potentially stable analog of the @xmath2 vortex ( the so - called @xmath2 quasi - vortex @xcite ) . * in these contours , also six - site alternating @xmath0-@xmath1 phase configurations are potentially stable , while in - phase configurations are not stable .",
    "while this instability can be implicitly inferred from the instability of the corresponding building blocks ( i.e. , the instability of the in - phase dipole and the potential stability of the out - of - phase dipole @xcite ) , its quantitative characteristics can only be traced through the approach presented below . * in three - site contours , the only potentially stable configuration is that of a discrete vortex , while both in - phase and alternating phase configurations are observed to be unstable . *",
    "the evolution of the dynamical instability in these lattices is more complex than in the square lattice case , and may involve not only degeneration to single - site solitons but possibly to multi - site solitary wave structures , and often the formation of robust breathing states , consisting of multiple sites ( possibly even as many as the original configuration ) .",
    "in fact two clear breather formations recur in multiple simulations : * * two sites with fluctuating , usually opposite , relative phases and oscillating amplitudes of comparable magnitude . * * two sites with different amplitudes oscillating between the same relative phases and opposite relative phases , depending on whether the amplitudes are closer or further , respectively .",
    "six - site configurations with phases of @xmath0 or @xmath1 will be collectively called `` hexapoles '' herein , while three - site configurations with phases @xmath0 or @xmath1 will be collectively termed `` tripoles '' .",
    "our presentation of the above findings is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we provide the background for the theoretical analysis . in section iii ,",
    "we corroborate the theoretical findings with numerical bifurcation results illustrating the various nonlinear modes in both hexagonal and honeycomb geometries and their stability properties , while the corresponding dynamics are presented in section iv .",
    "finally , in section v , we summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "we consider the following discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) for the two geometries of interest : @xmath4 where the summation is over the set @xmath5 of nearest neighbors ( denoted by @xmath6 ) of the site @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the cardinality of the set @xmath5 of neighboring sites ( six in the hexagonal geometry and three in the honeycomb ) , and @xmath9 models , e.g. , the envelope of the electric field in the corresponding waveguide @xcite , while @xmath10 represents the coupling strength between nearest neighbor nodes ; @xmath11 denotes the propagation distance along the crystal .         in the , so - called , anti - continuum ( ac )",

    "explicit solutions over contours of nodes indexed by @xmath13 can be easily found in the general form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the propagation constant and @xmath16 . without loss of generality we will fix the value of @xmath15 , taking @xmath17 , and we will consider three- and six - site contours in each of the hexagonal and honeycomb geometries , shown in fig . [ lattice ] . according to the earlier work of @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , the necessary condition for a discrete contour @xmath18 in the ac limit to persist in the presence of non - zero coupling is : @xmath19 for all @xmath20 .",
    "the stability can also be determined from the eigenvalues @xmath21 of the @xmath22 _ jacobian _ @xmath23 .",

    "( [ dnls_eq1 ] ) around a stationary solution with non - zero nodes in @xmath18 will have eigenvalue pairs @xmath24 given , to leading order , by the following relation in the case that the sites in @xmath18 are nearest neighbors : @xmath25    if the non - zero sites comprising the contour are next - nearest neighbors instead , as in the case of the three site contours for the honeycomb lattice geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ lattice ] ) , then @xmath10 is replaced by @xmath26 in the previous relation .",
    "unstable solutions for weak coupling ( small @xmath10 ) can then be identified as those for which the eigenvalues @xmath24 have non - zero real part , given the hamiltonian nature of the model .",
    "the jacobian matrix has the following form : @xmath27    we will consider primarily contours @xmath18 such that @xmath28 is constant for all @xmath20 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 , except one case which will be treated separately . in the primary case , all the non - zero elements of this matrix are then factors of @xmath33 , and the eigenvalue problem of the jacobian @xmath34 reduces to the following difference equations : @xmath35 these can be solved by a discrete fourier transform with any eigenvector @xmath36 , whence @xmath37 and then @xmath38 recall that for the honeycomb three - site next - nearest - neighbor contours the above formula should be used with @xmath10 replaced by @xmath26 .",

    "the relation ( [ stab ] ) for @xmath50 predicts double eigenvalue pairs at @xmath52 and @xmath53 and single pairs at @xmath54 and @xmath0 , while for @xmath51 each of these is multiplied by the imaginary unity .",
    "direct numerical computation and continuation in the coupling parameter @xmath10 from the ac limit confirm the predictions presented in fig .",
    "[ hex_6r ] .",
    "the in - phase configuration with @xmath50 becomes strongly unstable away from the ac limit , while the out - of - phase configuration with @xmath51 is stable for small @xmath10 .",
    "it should be noted that more generally any configuration that has two adjacent in - phase nodes along the six - site contour will also be unstable for all values of @xmath10 , while the _ only _ potentially stable configuration of this type ( real solution comprising @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases ) is the out - of - phase adjacent node structure of @xmath51 .",
    "however , even for that configuration , the imaginary eigenvalues which bifurcate from the origin in the ac limit have the topological property of , so - called , negative krein signature @xcite ; this means practically that they become structurally unstable upon collision with other eigenvalues , such as those of the phonon band , which have positive krein signature .",
    "hence , when the coupling becomes sufficiently large ( @xmath55 ) , these eigenvalues eventually intersect with the continuous spectrum ( the phonon band ) edge located at @xmath56 , and result in hamiltonian - hopf bifurcations associated with complex quartets of eigenvalues and oscillatory instabilities .",
    "such collisions can be detected in the graphs illustrating the lowest imaginary eigenvalue parts @xmath57 in the bottom right panel of figure [ hex_6r ] , and are associated with the points where the eigenvalue trajectories begin to level out .",
    "the spectrum of the solution at @xmath58 in the bottom middle panel of fig .",
    "[ hex_6r ] reveals the presence of such quartets .",
    "next , we consider the complex valued solutions along the six site contours , for which our conditions guarantee vorticity ( i.e. , the relevant solutions will be discrete vortices whose phase completes a round trip of a multiple of @xmath32 along the discrete contour ) .",
    "the fundamental solutions here are for @xmath59 , which is a singly - charged vortex , and @xmath60 , which is a doubly - charged vortex .",
    "the relation ( [ stab ] ) predicts that the singly - charged vortex will be unstable with double eigenvalue pairs @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and single pairs at @xmath63 and @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the doubly - charged vortex is actually _",
    "stable _ in this lattice geometry for sufficiently small values of the coupling , with the same pairs as the singly charged vortex , except multiplied by @xmath64 .",
    "figure [ hex_6s ] presents both types of configurations , indeed illustrating the numerical linear instability of the former , and numerical linear stability of the latter structures .",
    "nevertheless , it should be pointed out that for higher values of the inter - site coupling ( @xmath65 ) in this case also , the topological charge @xmath2 solution eventually becomes unstable as well due to oscillatory instabilities , as is shown in the bottom right continuations of the relevant eigenvalues of figure [ hex_6s ] .",
    "notice also the generally excellent qualitative and good quantitative agreement at least for small values of @xmath10 ( for larger values of the coupling parameter higher order effects become important) between the theoretical predictions of eq .",
    "( [ stab ] ) and the numerical results .         except for the honeycomb lattice .",

    "we consider three such cases , similarly to @xcite where a klein - gordon model was considered . the first two are the standard real ( @xmath50 ) and complex - valued ( @xmath60 , corresponding to a discrete vortex of topological charge @xmath3 ) ones , while the last one is the non - standard case with phases @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 for the three sites . for @xmath50 the theoretically predicted double pair of @xmath67 and pair at @xmath0 are confirmed to exist in the middle row of figure [ hex_3 ] , while for the discrete singly - charged vortex solution with @xmath60 , the double pair @xmath68 and a pair at @xmath0",

    "[ hex_3 ] .",
    "it should be noted that for larger coupling ( @xmath69 ) the double pair of eigenvalues splits , as can be observed in the numerical results .",
    "these solutions also become unstable as usual after the first eigenvalue collides with the continuous spectrum at @xmath70 . on the other hand , for the configuration with phases @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 of the top rows , one pair of eigenvalues",
    "remains at the origin , due to the phase invariance , while one of the remaining two pairs becomes imaginary ( theoretically predicted as @xmath71 ) and the other one becomes real ( predicted as @xmath72 ) .",
    "we can again observe that the full numerical results agree well not only qualitatively but also even quantitatively with the theoretical description .",
    "we now explore the same configurations systematically in the case of the honeycomb lattice geometry , in which each node has three neighbors as opposed to six . in .",
    "[ honey_6r ] , we again consider two representative real configurations , namely the in - phase six - site structure ( top row ) , and the out - of - phase hexapole , where adjacent neighbors have a relative phase shift of @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the principal stability characteristics are similar to those in the hexagonal case , in agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "in fact , we can observe that quantitatively the agreement of the linearization eigenvalues is arguably even better between theoretical predictions and full numerical computations in this case .",
    "this is because the central site , mediating second - order inter - site interaction between the excited sites , is absent in the six - site configuration in the honeycomb lattice ( contrary to the case for the hexagonal configuration ) .",
    "this feature reduces the role of higher order corrections to the theoretical predictions and hence renders the leading order predictions accurate for wider parametric ranges .",

    "the six - site discrete vortices are illustrated for this lattice in fig .",
    "[ honey_6s ] .",

    "interestingly , in this case , for @xmath81 , and a @xmath86 perturbation , all configurations result in multi - site breathing structures with up to four populated sites for long propagation distances .",
    "since the dynamical evolution of the six - site configurations in the hexagonal geometry all involve communications with the center site , it is reasonable to hypothesize that this is a major contributor to the rather significant differences observed below between the nonlinear evolution presented in this and the previous subsection .",
    "first , we display the results of the evolution of a real valued configuration from fig .",
    "[ honey_6r ] in fig .",
    "[ honey_6ip_dyno ] .",
    "the linearized system of the solution with @xmath50 in fig . [ honey_6ip_dyno ] is strongly unstable with five real pairs of eigenvalues , and the one with @xmath51 has all the same multiplied by the imaginary unity .",
    "the dynamical evolution confirms the stability analysis and two sites decay very rapidly for the in - phase configuration , while much more slowly for the more stable out - of - phase one ( not shown ) . on the other hand , it is noteworthy that the four sites persist for long distances in each case and that the more linearly stable out - of - phase one decays into three sites eventually , which have apparently uncorrelated phases .",
    "the resulting four site breather in the in - phase case for @xmath81 ( left ) is actually comprised of two out - of - phase breather pairs , such as the one in fig .",
    "[ hex_6s2_dyno ] , while for @xmath93 ( right ) the phases of the unequal amplitude breather pair oscillate between in - phase and out - of - phase .",
    "also , as in the hexagonal case of the @xmath50 family , we explored the sensitivity of the nonlinear evolution to larger perturbation and coupling and found that two sites robustly remain for the larger coupling @xmath93 , while four remain for @xmath81 ( not shown ) .",
    "for this reason , these solutions were continued for an extra long propagation distance up to @xmath92 , and for consistency and comparison the remaining cases in this setting will also be continued for the same distances .    the instability of the discrete vortices from fig . [ honey_6s ]",
    "results in multiple sites persisting with large amplitude oscillations for long distances , ultimately evolving to an out - of - phase two - site breathing structure for the singly - charged ( @xmath59 ) one ( not shown ) and a four - site structure for the doubly - charged ( @xmath60 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ honey_6s2_dyno ] .",
    "this four site structure consists of an out - of - phase pair close in amplitude and an unequal amplitude pair oscillating between in - phase and out - of - phase ( see right panels ) until a very long distance when they reshape into two out - of - phase pairs ( phase not shown ) .",
    "the latter part is reminiscent of the result of evolution of the in - phase hexapole for small @xmath10 given in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ honey_6ip_dyno ] .",
    "finally , we show the evolutions of the three - site configurations from fig .",
    "[ honey_3 ] .",
    "figure [ honey_3udu_dyno ] displays the dynamics of an unstable @xmath94 solution . the persistence for very long distances of the three sites for the smaller coupling prompted an investigation of a solution with larger coupling of @xmath95 from this family .",
    "this turned out to decay very rapidly to a single site ( not shown ) . in the smaller coupling case ,",
    "an intricate breathing pattern emerges which apparently converts the mode into a three - site breather ( rather than a three - site stationary solution ) .",
    "the three - site configuration with @xmath96 is not shown , but again here all three sites survive for a long propagation distance for @xmath81 .",
    "this does not necessarily contradict the linear instability , since the configuration deviates almost immediately in terms of amplitude distribution .",
    "there is no clear correlation in the phases in this case . again",
    "the persistence of all three sites for @xmath81 prompted investigation for a larger coupling @xmath93 and again a single site ultimately remained , although in this case two sites also persisted for a significant distance before the ultimate degeneration into a single - site waveform .",
    "for the last three site configuration the same consideration of the coupling arises , since this configuration is unique among those considered here , in the sense that a considerably larger coupling strength is required for the imaginary eigenvalues to collide with the continuous spectrum and the instability of this state to occur .",
    "even with the very mild instability when the first imaginary pair collides with the phonon band at the very large coupling value of @xmath97 , the dynamics clearly illustrate the oscillatory instability .",
    "the original configuration persists until @xmath98 , ultimately concentrating primarly on a single site for long propagation distances . aside from the six - site in - phase configuration",
    ", this is the only one for which the dynamics are qualitatively similar in the honeycomb and hexagonal geometries .",
    "breathers remained for certain parameter values for all other configurations considered .",
    "the relative phases of the two - site breathers which recurred in many of the simulations suggest that these may exist as potentially stable time - periodic solutions .",
    "in the present work we have examined both discrete soliton and discrete vortex configurations on non - square lattices for a prototypical discrete nonlinear hamiltonian evolution equation ( namely , the dnls equation ) of diverse interest to various areas of nonlinear optics and potentially of atomic physics .",
    "we studied , in particular , three- and six - site configurations in non - square lattice geometries in the case that each node has six neighbors ( hexagonal lattice ) , as well as in the case that each node has three neighbors ( honeycomb lattice ) .",
    "theoretical predictions for the stability of six - site real configurations were the same in each case and the in - phase version was strongly unstable ( and generally all configurations with any pair of in - phase nearest neighbors will be unstable ) , while the out - of - phase configuration was subject only to weak oscillatory instabilities stemming from complex quartets of eigenvalues that arise when imaginary eigenvalues with negative krein signature collide with the continuous spectrum ( of positive krein signature ) .",
    "on the other hand , among complex solutions , we highlighted the cases of topological , singly- and doubly - charged structures ( discrete vortices ) . in",
    "both the hexagonal and honeycomb geometries it was found that the former configuration is strongly unstable , while the latter may be stable for sufficiently weak couplings .",
    "it is also relevant in this context to point out that our results were presented for the case of a focusing nonlinearity , but it is straightforward to extend them to the defocusing case .",
    "there , it is expected that these features will be reversed , i.e. , the vortex of charge @xmath3 will be stable , while that of @xmath2 will be unstable in contrast to the effect of such a transformation on the fundamental four - site contour in a square lattice .",
    "similarly the in - phase structure will be stabilized , while the out - of - phase one will be destabilized which , however , is consistent with the case of the square lattice .",
    "this can be inferred by a staggering transformation along the one - dimensional contour of excited sites , which changes by @xmath1 the phase of , say , just the odd ( or equivalently just the even ) sites of the contour .",
    "for the three - site configurations , on the other hand , there was a difference between the honeycomb and hexagonal geometries which arises due to the fact that such a configuration occurs in the honeycomb case comprised of next nearest neighbors and therefore the eigenvalues grow at a higher order in @xmath10 : in fact , linearly ( compared to a growth proportional to @xmath99 in the hexagonal case ) .",
    "nevertheless , in all cases , our theoretical predictions were confirmed qualitatively , but also quantitatively ( at least for small @xmath10 ) by numerical continuation / bifurcation results .",
    "finally , the dynamics of these states revealed a number of somewhat unexpected features . unlike the expectation of square geometries that the relevant configurations may typically degenerate to a single - site solitary excitation , we have observed in various cases , that not only can the configuration reduce to waveforms with a larger number of excited sites , but also it can even preserve its original amplitude profile in terms of the number of excited sites  exhibiting breathing oscillations in the amplitude of these sites , or an internal reshaping of their relative phase .",
    "a breather composed of two - sites having comparable amplitudes and being usually out - of - phase with one another recurs in the dynamics of several solutions , as well as one with two uneven amplitudes in which the phases oscillate between in - phase and out - of - phase according to whether the amplitudes are closer or further apart , respectively .",
    "also , in some cases there are very particular amplitude structures with no apparent phase correlation , such as the three - site structure that persist over long distances after the decomposition of the six - site in - phase configuration in the hexagonal geometry .",
    "it is also worthwhile to highlight the sensitive dependence of the evolution on the coupling parameter . for large values of the coupling ,",
    "the degeneration to a single - site excitation apparently becomes more likely due to the fact that many of the multi - site configurations disappear through bifurcations , as has been discussed , e.g. , in one - dimensional settings in @xcite .",
    "there is a number of interesting directions suggested by these results for future studies",
    ". it would be relevant to examine , along lines similar to the earlier work of @xcite , whether the conclusions presented herein are also qualitatively similar to what can be found for discrete solitons and vortices in two - dimensional klein - gordon chains .",
    "it would also be relevant to consider the continuum analogs of these results , either for cubic or for saturable nonlinearities ( appearing , e.g. , in photorefractive crystals ) and see how the latter compare to the discrete theory , especially as concerns the qualitative structure of the linearization spectrum and the solutions predicted to be potentially stable .",
    "another direction would be to explore in more detail the nonlinear dynamics , to determine the exact mechanism which supports the complex breathing dynamical structures , identify exact breather solutions , and to explain the sensitivity of the evolution on the coupling parameter .",
    "finally , another interesting extension would be to consider such non - square lattices in a fully three - dimensional setting , including hexagonal - close - packed configurations .",
    "studies along some of these directions are presently underway and will be reported in future publications .",
