    "[ sec : intro ]    in recent years the study of an increasing number of natural phenomena that appear to deviate from standard statistical distributions has kindled interest in alternative formulations of statistical mechanics .    among the large class of phenomena which show asymptotic power - law behaviors",

    "typically , anomalous systems have multifractal or hierarchical structure , long - time memory , and long - range interaction @xcite .",
    "the success of the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) theory has suggested that new formulations of statistical mechanics should preserve most of the mathematical and epistemological structure of the classical theory , while reproducing the emerging phenomenology of anomalous systems . to this end ,",
    "new entropic forms have been introduced , which would generalized the classical one introduced by boltzmann and gibbs and , successively , by shannon in a different context ( bgs entropy ) @xmath2    there is no systematic way of deriving the `` right '' entropy for a given dynamical system . among the many generalizations of the bgs entropy , one can find the entropies considered by rnyi @xcite , by tsallis ( @xmath3 entropy ) @xcite , by abe @xcite , by tsallis , mendes and plastino ( escort entropy ) @xcite , by landsberg and vedral @xcite , and recently by kaniadakis ( @xmath4 entropy ) @xcite .",

    "generalizations lead to abandoning part of the original mathematical structure and properties .",
    "for instance , it is known that the bgs entropy is of trace form @xcite @xmath5 with @xmath6 ; on the contrary the rnyi entropy , the landsberg - vedral entropy , and the escort entropy are not of trace form .",
    "the rnyi entropy and the landsberg - vedral entropy are concave only for @xmath7 , while the escort entropy is concave only for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a fundamental test for a statistical functional @xmath9 of the probability distribution to be physically meaningful is given by the lesche stability condition @xcite : the relative variation @xmath10/{\\rm",
    "sup}[{\\cal o}(p)]\\big|$ ] should go to zero in the limit that the probabilities @xmath11 .",
    "this stability condition for a functional is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of an associated observable .",
    "lesche @xcite showed that , adopting the measure @xmath12 as estimator of the closure of the two distributions , the bgs entropy is stable , while the rnyi entropy is unstable ( except for the limiting case @xmath13 corresponding to the bgs entropy ) @xcite . also the landsberg - vedral entropy and the escort entropy do not satisfy the lesche criterion @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it is already known that the abe entropy @xcite , the q entropy @xcite , and the @xmath14 entropy @xcite are stable .    in the present paper , a natural continuation of the work in ref .",

    "a consistent framework is maintained with the use of the maximum entropy ( maxent ) principle .",
    "this approach yields a two - parameter class of nonstandard entropies introduced a quarter of a century ago by mittal @xcite and sharma , taneja @xcite and successively studied by borges and roditi in ref .",
