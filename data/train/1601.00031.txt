    "depletion forces can profoundly influence the properties of soft materials , e.g. , colloid - polymer mixtures  @xcite and polymer nanocomposites  @xcite , whose multiple species intermingle and exclude volume to one another .",
    "the exclusion of polymers , or other flexible macromolecules , from a layer surrounding rigid colloidal particles creates an imbalance in osmotic pressure that can induce an effective interparticle pair attraction .",
    "this depletion mechanism , recognized by asakura and oosawa over 60 years ago  @xcite , is physically reasonable and well established in the  colloid limit \" , in which the particle radius exceeds the average polymer radius of gyration . in the opposite  protein limit \" , in which nanoparticles ( e.g. , globular proteins ) can penetrate much larger polymer coils , the concept of a depletion layer around a particle must be replaced by that of a segment - segment correlation length ( blob radius ) of the polymer coil  @xcite .",
    "depending on the relative strengths of competing intermolecular interactions  @xcite , including steric , electrostatic , and van der waals interactions , depletion - induced attraction can drive aggregation and thermodynamic phase separation , leading , for example , to coexistence of polymer - rich and polymer - poor bulk phases  @xcite . in soft materials , where effective interactions  @xcite between macromolecules are typically comparable in magnitude to thermal energies , and self - assembly often depends on a delicate balance between energy and entropy , depletion can crucially affect phase stability . the ability to control depletion forces has great practical value for stabilizing foods  @xcite and pharmaceuticals against coagulation , purifying water by flocculation and sedimentation of colloidal particles  @xcite , guiding the self - assembly of virus particles  @xcite , and promoting or inhibiting aggregation of proteins  @xcite , with relevance for deciphering protein structure via scattering measurements on crystalline samples and treating diseases , such as cataracts  @xcite .",
    "an intrinsic complement to depletion is the phenomenon of macromolecular crowding , in which polymers , or other flexible macromolecules , deform in both size and shape in response to confinement by other species or bounding surfaces  @xcite .",
    "kuhn s prescient insight  @xcite that a polymer coil in solution fluctuates in shape , being well - approximated by an elongated , flattened ellipsoid ( in its principal - axis frame of reference ) , has inspired numerous mathematical and statistical mechanical analyses of the shapes of random walks  @xcite . in biology ,",

    "depletion forces , polymer crowding , and phase behavior in colloid - polymer mixtures and polymer - nanoparticle composite materials have been probed by a diverse array of experimental methods , including neutron scattering  @xcite , atomic force microscopy  @xcite , total internal reflection microscopy  @xcite , optical trapping  @xcite , and turbidity measurements  @xcite .",

    "the aov model represents nonadsorbing polymer coils , in a coarse - grained approximation , as effective spheres of fixed size that are mutually noninteracting , but impenetrable to the colloidal particles .",
    "the spherical polymer approximation ignores fluctuations in conformation , while the impenetrable polymer assumption is justified only in the colloid limit , where the polymers are smaller than the particles . as in our previous studies  @xcite , we refine the aov model by representing the polymers as soft ellipsoids that fluctuate in size and shape and that can be penetrated by smaller nanoparticles .    for simplicity , we focus on linear homopolymers , although the analysis can be generalized to other polymer architectures , such as block copolymers  @xcite .",
