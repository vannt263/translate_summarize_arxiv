    "in mathematics and physics the phrase `` symmetry breaking '' has distinct meanings .",
    "the first refers to the frequently observed phenomenon that a configuration of a physical system satisfying a law ( a set of equations ) which is invariant under a group of transformations , may itself be invariant under a subgroup of this group .",
    "this is referred to as _ spontaneous symmetry breaking_. the second meaning refers to the problem of explicitly adding symmetry breaking terms to the equations which describe the system .",
    "this is called _ induced _ or _ forced symmetry breaking_. in another words , _ forced symmetry breaking _ means the systematic study of an equivariant system of differential equations which is perturbed slightly so that it loses its symmetry properties partially or completely .",
    "+ the main motivation of this article is the presence of spiral waves in excitable media , especially in cardiac tissue .",
    "spiral waves arise as stable spatio - temporal patterns in various chemical , physical systems and biological systems , as well as numerical simulations of reaction - diffusion systems on excitable media with various geometries .",
    "excitable media are extended non - equilibrium systems having a uniform rest state that is linearly stable but susceptible to finite perturbations .",
    "spiral waves have been observed experimentally , for instance , in catalysis of platinum surfaces , belousov - zhabotinsky chemical reactions @xcite , rayleigh - bernard convection , and the most important , cardiac tissue @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of spiral waves have been done , for example in @xcite .",
    "winfree @xcite found spiral waves in the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction .",
    "+ it is now believed that spiral and scroll waves that appear in the heart muscle can lead to cardiac arrhythmias ( abnormal rhythms in the heart ) , giving rise to atrial fluttering or ventricular fibrillation . in normal hearts cardiac arrhythmias are rare , but in diseased hearts cardiac arrhythmias can become more common .",
    "for example , if chambers of the heart become abnormally large , they are susceptible to serious arrhythmias in which waves are believed to circulate in a fashion that is similar to the circulation of the belousov - zhabotinsky waves in a chemical medium .",
    "real human hearts are enormously complex three - dimensional structures . in this article",
    ", we assume that the geometry of the excitable media is a sphere , but the forced symmetry breaking from @xmath1 to @xmath0 allows us to consider either the case of the sphere with a localized inhomogeneity , or the case of a domain with @xmath0 symmetry , obtained by slightly deforming the sphere . in the case of the cardiac tissue , this is clearly an approximation .",
    "+ in the planar case , a rigidly rotating spiral wave is an example of wave pattern rotating around a center and being well approximated by an archimedean spiral wave far from rotation center .",
    "near the rotation center , there is a core region of the spiral wave , where the front of the wave has a tip , whose structure is considered to be the most important in understanding the behavior of the whole spiral wave .",
    "typical motions which have been observed for planar spiral waves are rigid rotation , quasi - periodic - meandering and linear meandering . using an ad hoc model ,",
    "barkley @xcite was the first to realize the key importance of the group @xmath4 of all planar translations and rotations in describing the dynamics and bifurcations of planar spiral waves . from a mathematical point of view , for the planar case , rigidly rotating spiral waves are examples of rotating waves , meandering spiral waves are examples of modulated rotating waves and linearly drifting spiral waves are examples of modulated travelling waves .",
    "the first rigorous mathematical theory of the planar spiral waves was done by wulff @xcite using liapunov - schmidt reduction on scales of banach spaces .",
    "these results were generalized by wulff to general non - compact lie groups in @xcite .",
    "comanici @xcite and chan @xcite have independently expanded this work to the rotation group @xmath5 , using different approaches .",
    "sandstede , scheel and wulff @xcite proved a finite - dimensional center bundle reduction theorem near a relative equilibrium @xmath6 of an infinite - dimensional vector field on a banach space @xmath7 on which acts a finite - dimensional lie group ( not necessarily compact ) . using the results of @xcite , the hopf bifurcation from one - armed and multi - armed rotating spiral wave to meandering spiral waves can be studied @xcite .",
    "+ in summary , the euclidean - equivariant center bundle approach has been remarkably successful at explaining many of the experimentally observed dynamics and bifurcations of planar spiral waves .",
    "however , the euclidean symmetry is an approximation , since no physical experiment is infinite in spatial extent .",
    "+ there are indeed experiments on planar spiral waves which exhibit some phenomena which can not be explained by euclidean symmetry alone : boundary drifting @xcite , spiral anchoring on localized inhomogeneities @xcite and repelling by localized inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "boundary drifting has been observed in situations where size of the spiral wave core is comparable to the size of the spatial domain of the experiment . in this case , the spiral wave is attracted to the boundary of the domain and then drifts around the boundary in a meandering motion .",
    "the spiral waves with smaller cores do not drift around the boundary : the spiral wave tip goes straight through the boundary without any impediment @xcite .",
    "when local inhomogeneities are present , the spiral wave is attracted to these inhomogeneities , migrate towards them , and then rotate around them .",
    "some spiral waves are also repelled by these inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "+ there are also experiments in which two dynamic attractors , called _ entrainment attractor _ and _ resonance attractor _ are seen , which attractor is observed depends on the initial conditions of the experiment @xcite .",
    "all of these phenomena break the euclidean symmetry and as it has been shown in leblanc and wulff @xcite , these phenomena are generic consequences of imperfect euclidean symmetry .",
    "specifically , they have studied the effects of translation symmetry breaking on normally hyperbolic relative equilibria and normally hyperbolic relative periodic orbits in general systems of euclidean - equivariant differential equations which undergo a small perturbation that breaks the translational symmetry , while preserving rotational symmetry .",
    "+ also , both numerical and experimental work suggest that anisotropy also can lead to certain dynamical states for spiral waves which are inconsistent with euclidean symmetry .",
    "anisotropy can lead to phase - locked two - frequency epicycle spiral motions , and to complicated quasi - periodic meandering patterns which have overall discrete rotational symmetries .",
    "leblanc @xcite has investigated the effects the forced rotational symmetry breaking on spiral wave dynamics .",
    "+ all previous results are valid for planar spiral waves .",
    "the interest to consider spiral waves on non - planar surfaces is motivated by the applicability to problems in physiology ( cardiology ) , biology and chemistry .",
    "therefore , the study of spiral waves by experiments and numerical simulations of reaction - diffusion systems on the sphere and curved surfaces have recently been undertaken . in the case of spiral waves on a sphere , the dynamics is expected to be quite different because any spiral wave starting from a rotating center can not end at a point .",
    "the number of tips of a wave front can not be odd , and therefore , the dynamics of spiral waves may acquire new features qualitatively different from the planar case . + the dynamics of spiral waves in an excitable reaction - diffusion systems on a sphere was numerically investigated by @xcite , and @xcite who employ a spectral method using spherical harmonics as basis functions .",
    "amjadi @xcite treated the case of a periodic oscillating sphere as well .",
    "maselko @xcite , as well as maselko and showalter , performed experiments with belousov - zhabotinsky chemical waves propagating on the surface of a sphere .",
    "the influence of the topological constraints and the inhomogeneity in the excitability on the geometry and dynamics of spiral waves on a thin spherical shell of excitable media are presented in @xcite .",
    "also , rigidly rotating waves on spherical domains have been studied using kinematical theory , but we do not intend to describe this here .",
    "+ in this article we have studied only the trivial isotropy case , because as far as we are aware , there have been observed no @xmath8-spiral waves ( @xmath9 ) on spherical surfaces .",
    "also , in @xcite it was numerically verified that there is a critical size of the sphere below which self - sustained spiral waves can not exist .",
    "therefore , we use a sphere of an arbitrary , but fixed radius @xmath10 .",
    "guyard and lauterbach in @xcite studied forced symmetry breaking perturbations for periodic solutions , but their methods applied to the forced symmetry breaking from @xmath1 to @xmath0 do not give the results obtained in this article .",
    "+ there are almost no experiments or numerical simulations on spherical domains with localized inhomogeneities and on approximatively spherical domains , showing phenomena similar to boundary drifting , spiral anchoring at localized inhomogeneities or repelling from localized in homogeneities .",
    "following the approach for planar spiral waves , this can be investigated and we intend to present somewhere else , the numerical simulations illustrating the possibilities of these phenomena for spiral waves on spherical domains with localized inhomogeneities and on approximatively spherical domains . since for planar spiral waves , forced symmetry breaking from @xmath4 to @xmath0 was successful in explaining phenomena like boundary drifting , spiral anchoring on localized inhomogeneities or repelling by localized inhomogeneities , we will treat the same problem here , that is the forced symmetry breaking from @xmath1 to @xmath0 for rotating waves on the sphere .",
    "+ we consider the group @xmath0 as being diffeomorphic with the subgroup of @xmath1 defined by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 such that @xmath13 . section [ s : pert_rd ] is concerned with the set - up of the problem of forced symmetry - breaking from @xmath1 to @xmath0 for a normally hyperbolic relative equilibrium @xmath3 .",
    "this is done by studying @xmath0-equivariant reaction - diffusion systems on the sphere , that are small perturbations of @xmath1-equivariant reaction - diffusion systems on the sphere , having a relative equilibrium @xmath3 that persists to a normally hyperbolic @xmath0-invariant manifold @xmath2 , which is @xmath0-equivariant diffeomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "we recall the fact that the functional - analytical framework can be found in @xcite for the general lie groups . in section [",
    "s : perturbation ] , we obtain the @xmath0-equivariant finite - dimensional center manifold reduction and the corresponding reduced differential equations for the perturbed reaction - diffusion system , which include the general form of the @xmath0-equivariant perturbation on the center manifold near @xmath3 , therefore on @xmath2 .",
    "the orbit space reduction methods are presented in section [ s : projection ] and we use them to project the @xmath0-equivariant perturbed differential equations on @xmath2 onto the orbit space @xmath14 , which is diffeomorphic to the unit sphere @xmath15 . then , we show that the study of the perturbed dynamics ( including the orbital stability of the solutions that persist ) on @xmath2 reduces to the analysis of some differential equations on the unit sphere @xmath15 . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the dynamics on @xmath2 consist only of rotating waves . depending on the relation between the frequency vectors of these rotating waves and @xmath17 , we obtain that the rotating waves will project on the unit sphere @xmath15 either onto two antipodal hyperbolic equilibria or onto periodic solutions . using implicit function theorem and the poincar map , we prove the existence of two smooth branches of hyperbolic equilibria ( generically ) , and the existence of smooth branches of periodic solutions if some transversality conditions hold , and determine the stability of these solutions .",
    "section [ s : phase_space ] presents the effects of forced symmetry breaking for the rotating waves in the phase space .",
    "namely , depending on the frequency vectors of the rotating waves that form the relative equilibrium @xmath3 , these rotating waves will give @xmath0-orbits of rotating waves or @xmath0-orbits of modulated rotating waves ( if some transversality conditions hold ) .",
