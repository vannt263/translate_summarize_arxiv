    "_ constrained _ markov decision processes ( mdps ) form an important class of stochastic control problems and have been widely studied .",
    "existing works on constrained mdps can be roughly classified into four groups : ( i )  constrained discrete - time mdps with denumerable states @xcite and their extensive references , ( ii ) constrained discrete - time mdps with a polish state space @xcite and their bibliographies , ( iii ) constrained continuous - time mdps with denumerable states @xcite , and ( iv ) constrained continuous - time mdps with a polish state space @xcite .",
    "a review of these references shows that most of the related literature is concentrated with the first three groups . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the fourth group is addressed only in  @xcite for the average criteria .",
    "concerning group ( i ) , the existence and algorithms of constrained optimal policies are given in @xcite for _ variant _ discounted criteria when states and actions are finite , in @xcite for the discounted criteria and denumerable states , and in @xcite for the average criteria and denumerable states . also , the existence of constrained optimal policies and linear programming formulation for group ( ii ) are given in @xcite for the discounted criteria and in @xcite for the average criteria .",
    "although group ( iii ) has been studied in @xcite , the references @xcite deal with the case of a single constraint , the transition rates in @xcite are assumed to be bounded , and the assumption of denumerable states in these references can not be dropped . on the other hand , as mentioned above , constrained mdps in polish spaces are also studied in @xcite for the discrete - time case and in @xcite for the continuous - time case . however , the reward and cost functions in @xcite are assumed to be all _ bounded _ , and all cost functions in @xcite are assumed to be essentially _",
    "nonnegative_. further , such nonnegativeness assumption can not be removed because it is required for the use of the standard weak convergence of probability measures .",
    "this in turn implies that the constrained optimality problem of minimizing nonnegative costs in with constraints imposed on other nonnegative costs can not be transformed to an equivalent optimality problem of maximizing _ bounded _ rewards as in @xcite with constraints imposed on bounded costs .",
    "hence , the constrained discrete and continuous time mdps with polish spaces , in which rewards ( to be maximized ) and costs ( with constraints ) may be unbounded from above and from below , have not been studied .    on the other hand , as is known , continuous - time mdps in polish spaces have been studied in @xcite .",
    "however , the treatments in @xcite are on the unconstrained case , whereas the results in @xcite for the constrained case can not be applied to the case in which the criterion to be maximized is _ unbounded _ rewards .",
    "this is because the cost to be minimized in @xcite is required to be _",
    "nonnegative_. moreover , the study in @xcite with unbounded transition rates is limited to the class of _ markov _ policies , and yet the case of randomized policies depending on state histories in @xcite is for _ bounded _ transition rates .",
    "hence , as noted in @xcite , the study on unconstrained continuous - time mdps with unbounded transition rates and history - dependent policies is an unsolved problem",
    ".    constrained continuous - time mdps with unbounded transition rates and policies depending on state histories have _ not _ been studied yet , and they will be considered in this paper .",
    "more precisely , we will deal with constrained continuous - time mdps , which have the following features : @xmath1 the transition rates may be _ unbounded _ ; @xmath2 the reward and costs are admitted to be unbounded _ from above and from below _ ; @xmath3 the state and action spaces are polish spaces ; @xmath4 admissible policies can be randomized and _ depend on state histories _ ; and @xmath5 the optimality criterion is to _ maximize _ expected discounted rewards , and several constraints are imposed on expected discounted costs .",
    "first , we give the conditions under which we ensure the nonexplosion of underlying processes induced from _",
    "transition rates and randomized policies _ depending on state histories _",
    "( see theorem [ t2 ] below ) .",
    "this result is a natural extension of the corresponding regularity of a jump markov process in @xcite to a so - called `` non - markov '' case and also a generalization of the regularity in @xcite for _ bounded _ transition rates .",
    "inspired by the condition for the nonexplosion , we obtain a condition ( see theorem [ t3 ] below ) for the finiteness of the expected discount rewards / costs of each policy when rewards / costs are _",
    "unbounded_.    second , as in @xcite for constrained mdps , by introducing an occupation measure , we prove that the constrained optimality problem in continuous - time mdps [ see ( [ p ] ) below ] can be transformed into an _ equivalent _ optimality problem [ see ( [ 4.2b ] ) below ] over a class of some probability measures . the standard weak convergence technique used in @xcite for",
    "nonnegative costs does not apply directly to the case wherein rewards / costs are unbounded from above and from below .",
    "therefore , to solve the equivalent optimality problem in which rewards / costs may be unbounded from above and from below , we introduce ( definition [ de-4.2 ] below ) a so - called",
    "_ @xmath6-weak convergence _ of probability measures .",
    "this @xmath6-weak convergence is an extension of the standard weak convergence of probability measures . using the properties of the @xmath6-weak convergence and occupation measures developed here ( see theorem [ th-4.1 ] and lemmas [ th-4.5 ] and [ th-4.4 ] below )",
    ", we prove the existence of a constrained optimal policy under mild reasonable conditions ( see theorem [ th-4.6 ] below ) .",
    "these conditions are slightly different from the usual continuity - compactness ones in @xcite for continuous - time mdps and in @xcite for the discrete - time mdps , and thus they are weaker than those in the literature @xcite ; see remarks [ rem5.1-new ] and [ rem5.1 ] for details .",
    "third , for the solvability of constrained optimal policies , we further transform the equivalent optimality problem to a linear programming ( lp ) problem [ see ( [ lp ] ) below ] by using the properties of occupation measures again .",
    "then we present the relationship between a constrained optimal policy and an optimal solution to the lp ( see theorem [ th-5.1 ] below ) , and characterize a stationary policy ( see theorem  [ th-3.2 ] below ) .",
    "this relationship and characterization of a stationary policy are used to obtain the solvability and structure of a constrained optimal policy ( see corollary [ co-1 ] and theorem [ th-5.2 ] below ) .    finally , to illustrate our main results , we present two _ computable _ examples in which our conditions are satisfied , whereas some of those in @xcite fail to hold ( see remark [ rem5.2 ] below ) . in particular",
    ", our approach is also _",
    "suitable _ to the case of discrete - time mdps with rewards / costs being unbounded from above and from below , and similar results for the discrete - time case can also be obtained ; see remark [ rem5.1-rr ] for details .",
    "however , our model _ can not _ be transformed to an equivalent one of discrete - time mdps using the uniformization technique because the transition rates in our model may be _",
    "unbounded_.    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section-2 ] , the model and the constrained optimality problem that we are concerned with",
    "are introduced .",
