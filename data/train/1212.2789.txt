    "production under unstable electricity condition may cause serious loss of expense , such as large amount of rejects , in factories that include processes requiring highly stable electricity .",
    "for example , professional precious metal plating companies require to keep stable voltage at all times they work . in case that such factories or companies are situated in the unstable power supply area ,",
    "voltage stabilization is raised more importantly .",
    "n - m switching control system was motivated to meet the requirement raised from a plating factory for eating utensil set [ 3 ] .",
    "the quality of electricity being supplied to the factory was not good , that is , some days low or high voltage electricity was supplied .",
    "there was a manual voltage regulator switching between m levels in factory . when incoming voltage is too low or high , however , it was impossible to supply necessary voltage to the whole workplaces of the factory , even if operator switched up to maximum or minimum level .",
    "this is not a problem that would be solved just by installing larger capacity regulator , because bandwidth of input voltage of each regulator is limited .    from the standpoint of profit of the factory , it was better to produce only in workplaces which can be supplied with normal voltage by adjusting and distributing incoming voltage in real time , rather than all workplaces were exposed to the production failure of acceptable goods .",
    "but , there was no voltage regulator meeting such special requirement ( see section 2 for more details ) , though numerous works were devoted to design and implement various types of stable voltage suppliers , e.g. , [ 1 , 2 ] . to solve the problem we designed n - m switching control system , shortly n - m system in this paper , by combining a pc with the manual voltage regulator of the factory .",
    "n - m system is a real - time voltage normalization and distribution system that divides whole workplaces of factory into n sections , adjusts voltage height by switching between @xmath0 levels , and supplies normalized voltage to sections according to the given priority . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", n - m system is an original work , and thus design verification is necessarily needed for the successful implementation of system at low cost .    in this paper , we describe the working mechanism of n - m system and present a method to verify correctness of its design using ltl model checking technique .",
    "ltl ( linear - time temporal logic ) is a kind of temporal logic having strong expressive power to specify time - dependant properties of real - time systems and ltl - based model checking technique is now widely used in verification of real - time systems [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] .",
    "we do nt concentrate on describing the details of n - m system and the whole specifications of its requirements , rather focus on showing our method to verify n - m system for its time - dependant requirements using ltl model checking technique .",
    "in this section , we describe working mechanism , implementation method and time - dependant requirements of n - m system .",
    "whole workplaces of factory are divided into @xmath1 sections @xmath2 by considering relative independence of work .",
    "power supply priority is assigned to each section according to the importance or processing order of products .",
    "for example , we may give highest priority to silver - plating workplace .",
    "for the convenience of description , we assume that @xmath3 has higher priority than @xmath4 if @xmath5",
    ". voltage is adjusted at @xmath0 levels @xmath6 .",
    "there are three states for each level , that is , low voltage state @xmath7 , normal voltage state @xmath8 and high voltage state @xmath9 .",
    "this standard is set by considering technical requirements of production .",
    "we briefly describe working mechanism of n - m system below .",
    "system starts control in level @xmath10 where @xmath11 and does one of the following three behaviors .    * increase voltage by switching level into @xmath12 , if the incoming voltage is low .",
    "* supply electricity to section @xmath13 , if the incoming voltage is normal . * drop voltage by switching level into @xmath14 , if the incoming voltage is high .",
    "let us now assume that system is in level @xmath15 and current supplying sections are @xmath16 .    * suspend electricity supply to @xmath17 , if the incoming voltage is low .",
    "* supply electricity to section @xmath18 , if the incoming voltage is normal . * drop voltage by switching level into @xmath19 , if the incoming voltage is high .    for the practical design and implementation , more items than described above must be considered .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to show verification method of n - m system , and thus we do nt consider some details of the system .",
    "control of n - m system is realized using the values of @xmath20 bit string corresponding to the sections @xmath2 , voltage adjustment level @xmath21 @xmath22 and voltage states @xmath23 in each level .",
    "for example , in case @xmath24 and @xmath25 , bit value string 111 10 010 denotes that normal voltage is supplied to all sections by increasing voltage adjustment level to the maximum .",
    "the number of possible bit value string is @xmath26 for @xmath20 bit string , but some bit value string does not occur in control . in the above case , bit strings 010 01 010 and 010 11 001 do not occur .",
    "this is because system does not supply electricity to @xmath27 unless @xmath3 is supplied with electricity and voltage adjustment can not be in different level at the same time .",
    "exact number of bit value strings occurring in control is @xmath28 .",
    "this is not small number and it may fail to implement correct control system if we do nt verify design .",
    "we only consider 8 requirements of n - m system for the purpose of the paper , though there are many other requirements to be verified .",
    "+ @xmath29 : system decreases work section by one , if the voltage state is low in maximum level .",
    "@xmath30 : system suspends electricity supply to all sections , if the voltage state is high in minimum level .",
    "@xmath31 : system keeps current supplying sections and levels up by one , if voltage state is low and leveling up is possible .",

    ", we construct transition system model of n - m system and write ltl specifications of its requirements .",
    "then we check satisfaction relation between model and specifications using ltl model checking tool nusmv [ 9 - 11 ] .",
    "nusmv ( new symbolic model verifier ) was designed as an reliable verification of industrial sized designs and an research tool for formal verification techniques .",
    "nusmv supports the analysis of specifications expressed in ltl and other temporal logic ctl .",
