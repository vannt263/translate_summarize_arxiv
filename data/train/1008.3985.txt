    "<S> the general low level of line polarization suggests that the line forming regions for most species observed in the spectrum have a similar shape to that of the photosphere , which deviates from a spherical symmetry by @xmath1 . in comparison with spectropolarimetry of type ia and core - collapse sne at similar epochs , we find that the properties of sn  2005hk are most similar to those of type ia sne . in particular , we find the low levels of continuum and line polarization to indicate that the explosion mechanism is approximately spherical , with homogeneous ejecta ( unlike the chemically segregated ejecta of ccsne ) . </S>",
