    "a remarkable feature of these variational states is that at the mean - field level with respect to orbital degrees of freedom the total energy is just a sum of energies of individual dimers and does not depend on a particular dimer covering of a triangular lattice .",

    "the general rule to compute the overlap matrix for models , where every dimer represents a singlet pair , is to construct transition or overlap graph by drawing two dimer configurations on the same lattice . @xcite",
    "every closed nonintersecting loop of dimers contributes @xmath99 to the overlap matrix , @xmath100 being the length of the loop .",

    "the corresponding loops have @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "the difference reflects the fact that loops on an effective triangular lattice correspond to significantly longer loops on the original trimerized kagom lattice .",
    "for example , the shortest @xmath111 loop corresponds to a loop of length @xmath112 on a kagom lattice .",
    "loops @xmath113 and @xmath114 are different for the considered model because kagom lattice has only a three - fold rotation axis in the center of every triangle .",
    "significant difference of the overlap matrix elements explains why a qdm description is a poor approximation for a spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice,@xcite but may be a good one for the trimerized kagom antiferromagnet .",
    "below in this section we assume that the ground states of the first and second - order effective hamiltonians are given variationally by close - packed dimer states and compute a new effective qd hamiltonian .",
    "the above assumption is supported by numerical treatment of the trimerized kagom antiferromagnet.@xcite    derivation of a qdm from a particular spin hamiltonian has been formulated via calculation of the inverse square root of the overlap matrix .",

    "note , that @xmath141 from the above calculation .",
    "remaining freedom in the choice of sign of tunneling matrix elements is discussed in the next section .    since the potential energy @xmath142 is an order of magnitude smaller than the dimer hopping @xmath143 , the next relevant interactions besides the kinetic energy of two - dimer moves around @xmath111 may be three - dimer resonances along longer loops @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
