    "neutron stars accreting from low - mass binary companions ( low - mass x - ray binaries , or lmxbs ) have orbital periods of typically a few hours , and characteristically exhibit bursts from thermonuclear ignition of accreted material on the surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these objects are the evolutionary precursors to the `` recycled '' millisecond radio pulsars , which are thought to have been spun - up by an extended period of accretion .",
    "there are @xmath2 lmxbs known @xcite ; most give no observational indications of their ( presumably ) rapid spin , although since 1996 some have been found to exhibit oscillations in the range 45620  hz only during thermonuclear bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the discovery of the 401  hz pulsar sax  j1808.4@xmath13658 in 1998 @xcite , an additional subset of lmxbs has emerged which consistently exhibit pulsations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "two sources show pulsations and burst oscillations at the same frequency , confirming that the latter phenomenon also traces the neutron - star spin @xcite .",
    "precisely what is different about these accretion - powered millisecond pulsars ( and the burst oscillation sources ) that allows us to measure the spin is not clear .    here",
    "i describe the properties of three of the seven accretion - powered millisecond pulsars , the first two representative of the two broad classes of binary which make up this group .",
    "observations were made with the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "the pca consists of five co - aligned proportional counter units ( pcus ) , sensitive to photons in the energy range 260  kev and with a total effective area of @xmath3 . arriving photons",
    "are time - tagged to approximately @xmath4s , and their energy is measured to a precision of @xmath5% at 6  kev .",
    "the pca is presently the only instrument with sufficient sensitivity and temporal resolution to reliably detect the persistent pulsations in the accretion - powered millisecond pulsars .",
    "this high  galactic - latitude x - ray transient was first detected in outburst during april 2002 by the all - sky monitor ( asm ) aboard _ rxte _ @xcite .",
    "the asm consists of three scanning shadow cameras sensitive to 1.512  kev photons which provides 90  s exposures of most of the sky every 96  min .",
    "xte  j0929@xmath1314 was identified using a `` deep sky map '' technique , in which maps of flux residuals are constructed by cross - correlating the predicted coded mask pattern against the best - fit data residuals for each @xmath6 cell in the field of view .",
    "the resulting sensitivity for new sources is as low as @xmath7  mcrab away from the galactic center , compared to the typical @xmath8 mcrab threshold for individual camera snapshots .",
    "pca observations revealed 185  hz ( 5.4  ms ) pulsations , with a fractional rms amplitude of 37% , modulated by a 43.6  min binary orbit .",
    "the roche lobe in such a tiny binary can not contain a main - sequence companion , indicating that the mass donor is highly evolved and h - poor @xcite .",
    "the system has one of the smallest measured mass functions ( @xmath9 ) of any stellar binary .",
    "the binary parameters imply a @xmath10 white dwarf donor with a moderately high inclination .",
    "xte  j0929@xmath1314 was the second ultracompact binary millisecond pulsar discovered , after xte  j1751@xmath1305 ( 42  min ; * ? ? ? * ) and was later joined by a third , xte  j1807@xmath1294 ( 40  min ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is an open question why the orbital periods of these sources should cluster so closely around 40  min .",
    "xte  j0929@xmath1314 remained x - ray active for just over two months , by which time the _ rxte _ observations revealed spin - down at an average rate of @xmath11 hz  s@xmath12 .",
    "the spin - down torque may arise from magnetic coupling to the accretion disk , a magnetohydrodynamic wind , or gravitational radiation from the rapidly spinning pulsar .",
    "this recurrent x - ray transient was initially identified by esa s _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ _ integral _ in 2004 december , during a series of galactic plane scans conducted every 12  d @xcite .",
    "the source was detected with the ibis / isgri coded - mask imager @xcite , which is sensitive to photons in the range 15  kev to 1  mev and with a @xmath13 field of view .",
    "the _ rxte_/pca observations which followed revealed 599  hz ( 1.67 ms ) pulsations with a fractional rms amplitude of 9% ( 313 kev ) .",
    "the neutron star is in a 2.46  hr orbit with a very low - mass donor , most likely a brown dwarf heated by the x - ray emission originating from the neutron star @xcite .",
    "the binary parameters of the system are similar to those of the first known accreting millisecond pulsar , sax j1808.4@xmath13658 . while the companions of these systems are also very low - mass , like that of xte  j0929@xmath1314 , the mass donors for the longer - orbital period systems are likely still h - rich .",
    "the source remained active for less than 20  d ( fig .",
    "[ fluxigr ] , left ) .",
    "_ chandra _ observations revealed significant variability in quiescence @xcite . once the source position was known , a search of earlier _",
    "rxte_/asm observations revealed two prior outbursts , three and six years before .",
    "the outburst recurrence time is similar to that of sax  j1808.4@xmath13658 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the most recently - discovered accretion - powered pulsar , hete  j1900@xmath12455 exhibits distinctly different behaviour in several respects to the rest of the population . the source was discovered in 2005 june when a strong thermonuclear ( type - i ) burst was detected by _ hete - ii _ @xcite . _ hete - ii _ was designed to study gamma - ray bursts @xcite , but thanks to sensitivity extending into the x - ray band can also detect thermonuclear bursts from accreting neutron stars .",
    "subsequent _ rxte _ observations of the field revealed pulsations at 377.3  hz @xcite as well as doppler shifts of the apparent pulsar frequency , originating from orbital motion in the 83.25  min binary @xcite . in this case",
    "the roche lobe can accommodate a brown dwarf with no need for extra heating .",
    "the rms amplitude of the pulsations was unusually low compared to the other pulsars , at best 2% . during the initial _ rxte _ observations ,",
    "the source underwent a short - lived flare after which the pulsations became undetectable .",
    "such behaviour has not been observed in the other six pulsars , in which pulsations are consistently detected while the sources are x - ray bright .",
    "however , the pulsar outburst has also lasted much longer than in the other sources @xcite , and in fact at the time of writing ( 2006 june ) the source is still active and being monitored with regular _ rxte _ observations . assuming that activity continues at the present level , the time - averaged accretion rate ( at the estimated distance of 5  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the highest amongst all of the millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "accretion - powered millisecond pulsars represent a rapidly - growing subclass of lmxbs .",
    "the present sample is sufficiently small that new examples can still reveal vital clues as to the physics of these extreme objects ; consequently , searches for , and observations of , new examples are a high priority for _ rxte _ and other x - ray missions .",
    "observations of hete  j1900.1@xmath12455 suggest , for the first time , a connection between the transient pulsars and the non - pulsing ( typically ) persistent lmxb population .",
    "the combined spin distribution for rapidly - rotating neutron stars , including both accretion- and rotation - powered , has a present maximum of 716  hz @xcite .",
    "this value is substantially below the expected breakup frequency , and while selection effects may explain the non - detection of faster radio pulsars , no such effects reduce the likelihood of detecting faster pulsars in the x - ray band .",
    "it has been suggested that the torques which spin - up accreting neutron stars may be balanced at high spin frequencies by gravitational radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a bayesian analysis suggests that the observed spin frequency distribution of accreting neutron stars is consistent with a uniform distribution up to some maximum value between 700 and 800  hz @xcite .",
    "if this `` speed limit '' is indeed imposed by gravitational wave emission , there is the exciting possibility of detecting these sources with the next generation of gravitational wave detectors , such as the advanced laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by virtue of its `` quasi - persistent '' behaviour ,",
    "hete  j1900.1@xmath12455 is presently the best accretion - powered millisecond pulsar candidate for the detection of gravitational radiation .    while the observed distribution of spin frequencies does not appear significantly different between the burst oscillation sources and pulsars , the orbital periods are substantially shorter on average ( fig .",
    "[ fluxigr ] , right ) , particularly when compared to the entire lmxb population .",
    "the k - s test statistic comparing the @xmath14 distribution of the millisecond pulsars and the known values for the non - pulsing lmxbs @xcite is 0.751 , corresponding to a 99.9% probability that the two populations are not drawn from the same distribution .",
    "the question of why certain sources exhibit persistent pulsations and others do not , remains open .",
    "however , more detailed studies of the behaviour of hete  j1900.1@xmath12455 may soon shed light on this question .                                                          , r. 2004 , in proceedings of the 2nd bepposax conference : `` the restless high - energy universe '' , amsterdam , 59 may 2003 , ed .",
