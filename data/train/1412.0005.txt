    "the resulting coherent configuration may be understood as the ground state of some gigantic bosonic atom where the boson particles are condensed in a single macroscopic quantum state @xmath1 . in the bec model ,",
    "the formation of dark matter structures at small scales is suppressed by quantum mechanics .",
    "this property could alleviate the problems of the cdm model such as the cusp problem @xcite and the missing satellite problem @xcite . at the scale of galaxies ,",
    "newtonian gravity can be used so the evolution of the wave function @xmath2 is governed by the gross - pitaevskii - poisson ( gpp ) system .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite is valid at @xmath3 which is relevant for the most compact dwarf halos .",
    "using the madelung @xcite transformation , the gp equation turns out to be equivalent to hydrodynamic ( euler ) equations involving an isotropic pressure due to short - range interactions ( scattering ) and an anisotropic quantum pressure arising from the heisenberg uncertainty principle . at large scales ,",
    "quantum effects are negligible and one recovers the classical hydrodynamic equations of the cdm model which are remarkably successful in explaining the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite . at small - scales ,",
    "the pressure arising from the heisenberg uncertainty principle or from the repulsive scattering of the bosons may stabilize dark matter halos against gravitational collapse and lead to smooth core densities instead of cuspy density profiles in agreement with the observations @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics may therefore be a way to solve the problems of the cdm model .",
    "the possibility that dark matter could be in the form of becs has a long history ( see recent reviews in @xcite ) . in some works @xcite",

    ", it is assumed that the bosons have a repulsive self - interaction measured by the scattering length @xmath7 . in that case , gravitational collapse is prevented by the pressure arising from the scattering . in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation which amounts to neglecting the quantum pressure ,",

    "the general mass - radius relation of self - gravitating becs at @xmath3 with an arbitrary scattering length @xmath21 , connecting the non - interacting limit ( @xmath22 ) to the tf limit ( @xmath23 ) , has been determined analytically and numerically in @xcite .",
    "these papers also provide the general density profile of dark matter halos interpreted as self - gravitating becs at @xmath3 ( solitons ) .",
    "the effect of a finite temperature has been considered in @xcite using different approaches .",
    "since atoms like @xmath24 have negative scattering lengths in terrestrial bec experiments @xcite , it may be relevant to consider the possibility of self - gravitating becs with an attractive self - interaction ( @xmath25 ) . in that case , there exist a maximum mass @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the self - interaction constant and @xmath28 is the planck mass , above which the bec collapses @xcite . in most applications ,",
    "this mass is extremely small ( when @xmath29 it is of the order of the planck mass @xmath30 ! ) so that the collapse of the bec is very easily realized in the presence of an attractive self - interaction .",
    "this may lead to the formation of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies @xcite . on the other hand , when the bec hypothesis is applied in a cosmological context",
    ", an attractive self - interaction can enhance the jeans instability and accelerate the formation of structures in the universe @xcite .",
    "self - gravitating becs have also been proposed to describe boson stars @xcite . for these compact objects",
    ", we must use general relativity and couple the klein - gordon equation to the einstein field equations . initially ,",
    "the study of boson stars was motivated by the axion field , a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson of the peccei - quinn phase transition , that was proposed as a possible solution to the strong cp problem in qcd . in the early works of kaup @xcite and ruffini & bonazzola @xcite",
    ", it was assumed that the bosons have no self - interaction .",
    "this leads to a maximum mass of boson stars equal to @xmath31 . above that mass no equilibrium configuration exists",
    ". in that case",
    ", the system collapses into a black hole .",
    "this maximum mass is much smaller than the maximum mass @xmath32 of fermion stars determined by oppenheimer and volkoff @xcite in general relativity .",
    "they differ by a factor @xmath33 .",
    "this is because boson stars are stopped from collapsing by heisenberg s uncertainty principle while , for fermion stars , gravitational collapse is avoided by pauli s exclusion principle . for @xmath34 ,",
    "corresponding to the typical mass of the neutrons , the kaup mass @xmath35 is very small .",
    "this corresponds to mini boson stars like axion black holes .",
    "the mass of these mini boson stars may be too small to be astrophysically relevant .",
    "they could play a role , however , if they exist in the universe in abundance or if the axion mass is extraordinary small leading to macroscopic objects with a mass @xmath36 comparable to the mass of the sun ( or even larger ) @xcite .",
    "for example , axionic boson stars could account for the mass of machos ( between @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath39 ) if the axions have a mass @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed that stable boson stars with a boson mass @xmath41 could mimic supermassive black holes ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) that reside at the center of galaxies @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , colpi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite assumed that the bosons have a repulsive self - interaction . in the thomas - fermi approximation , this leads to a maximum mass @xmath44 which , for @xmath45 , is of the order of the maximum mass of fermion stars @xmath32 .",
    "the self - interaction has the same effect on the bosons as the exclusion principle on the fermions .",
    "it plays the role of an interparticle repulsion ( for @xmath46 ) that dominates over uncertainty pressure and prevents catastrophic gravitational collapse .",
    "therefore , for @xmath34 and @xmath45 , we get a maximum mass of the order of the solar mass @xmath39 , similar to the mass of neutron stars , which is much larger than the maximum mass @xmath35 obtained in the absence of self - interaction ( an interpolation formula giving the maximum mass for any value of the self - interaction constant @xmath47 is given in appendix b.5 of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a self - interaction can significantly change the physical dimensions of boson stars , making them much more astrophysically interesting .",
    "for example , stellar mass boson stars could constitute a part of dark matter @xcite .",
    "recently , chavanis and harko @xcite have proposed that , because of the superfluid properties of the core of neutron stars , the neutrons ( fermions ) could form cooper pairs and behave as bosons of mass @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the mass of the neutrons .",
    "therefore , neutron stars could actually be bec stars ! since the maximum mass of bec stars @xmath50 depends on the self - interaction constant @xmath47 ( or scattering length @xmath21 ) , this allows to overcome the ( fixed ) maximum mass of neutron stars @xmath51 determined by oppenheimer and volkoff @xcite by modeling a neutron star as an ideal gas of fermions of mass @xmath52 ( the corresponding radius is @xmath53 and the corresponding density is @xmath54 ) . by taking a scattering length of the order of @xmath55 ( hence @xmath56 )",
    ", we obtain a maximum mass of the order of @xmath57 , a central density of the order @xmath58 , and a radius in the range @xmath59 .",
    "this could account for the recently observed neutron stars with masses in the range of @xmath60 @xcite much larger than the oppenheimer - volkoff limit @xcite . for @xmath61 ,",
    "nothing prevents the gravitational collapse of the star which becomes a black hole . on the other hand , for a boson mass of the order of @xmath62 and a self - interaction constant @xmath45 , we get @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "these parameters are reminiscent of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei , so that stable self - interacting boson stars with @xmath65 could be an alternative to black holes at the center of galaxies @xcite .",
    "self - gravitating becs may also find applications in the physics of black holes @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed recently that microscopic quantum black holes could be becs of gravitons stuck at a critical point @xcite .",
    "these results can be understood easily in terms of the kaup mass and kaup radius @xcite .",
    "therefore , self - gravitating becs can have many applications in astrophysics , cosmology and black hole physics with promising perspectives .    in this paper ,",
    "we come back to certain approximations that have been made in the study of self - gravitating becs and discuss them in more detail .",
    "in their study of general relativistic bec stars , chavanis and harko @xcite first presented qualitative arguments giving the fundamental scalings of the maximum mass @xmath66 , minimum radius @xmath67 , and maximum density @xmath68 of bec stars .",
    "then , they developed two models in order to obtain the numerical values of the prefactors .",
    "they first developed a semi - relativistic model in which gravity is treated by general relativity using the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation but the relation between the pressure and the energy density is given by the quadratic equation of state @xmath69 obtained from the classical gross - pitaevskii equation after identifying the energy density with the rest - mass density ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "this is a particular case of a polytropic equation of state , corresponding to an index @xmath8 , studied by tooper @xcite in general relativity .",
    "this semi - relativistic model leads to a maximum mass @xmath71 .",
    "this treatment is approximate first because the energy density is not always dominated by the rest - mass density and also because the relation between the pressure and the rest - mass density is altered by relativistic effects .",
    "chavanis and harko @xcite also developed a fully - relativistic model in which the relation between the pressure and the energy density is obtained from the klein - gordon equation @xcite . in the dense core ,",
    "the equation of state reduces to @xmath72 which is similar to the equation of state of the radiation or to the equation of state that prevails in the core of neutron stars modeled as an ideal gas of fermions at @xmath3 . in the envelope",

    "this partially - relativistic model leads to a maximum mass @xmath79 intermediate between the two models considered by chavanis and harko @xcite .",
    "this treatment is , however , approximate because the relation between the pressure and the rest - mass density is altered by relativistic effects .",
    "self - gravitating becs have also been considered in cosmology .",
    "harko @xcite and chavanis @xcite independently developed cosmological models in which dark matter is made of becs .",
    "they solved the friedmann equations by assuming that the equation of state relating the pressure to the energy density is given by @xmath69 , as for newtonian becs .",
    "however , this equation of state is not valid when the bec is strongly relativistic",
    ". therefore , their approach gives wrong results in the very early universe where relativistic effects are important .",
    "a fully - relativistic model should use the equation of state derived from the klein - gordon equation @xcite .",
    "this will be considered in a future work . as an intermediate step ,",
    "we consider here a partially - relativistic model in which the relation between the pressure and the rest - mass density is assumed to be given by @xmath9 ( as for a classical bec ) but pressure effects are taken into account in the relation between the energy density and the rest - mass density ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this leads to a cosmological model where the universe experiences a stiff matter phase , followed by a dust matter phase , and finally by a dark energy phase ( equivalent to a cosmological constant ) .",
    "the same evolution is obtained in zeldovich @xcite model which assumes that initially , near the cosmological singularity , the universe is filled with cold baryons .",
    "interestingly , the friedmann equations can be solved analytically in that case and provide a simple generalization of the @xmath0cdm model .",
