    "high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) provide an ideal opportunity to study the early universe and gain insights into the formation and evolution of massive galaxies . the well known hubble @xmath9 relation ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) establishes that at @xmath10 , radio galaxies can be used to trace the most massive star - forming populations .",
    "thanks to the large sky coverage of present - day radio surveys , we can find the rare sources @xmath11 magnitudes more luminous than similar redshift sources found in optical / near - ir surveys . together with the evolutionary path tracing hzrgs to low - redshift ( @xmath12 ) elliptical galaxies ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and the imperative that radio galaxies harbour central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , hzrgs are excellent laboratories for studying the earliest , most massive stellar systems .",
    "hzrgs show diffuse morphologies with strong evidence supporting high star - formation rates @xcite , starkly different to their low - redshift counterparts which are massive elliptical galaxies with little or no star formation .",
    "however , with only 26 hzrgs known at @xmath8 , the statistics are still unreliable .",
    "addressing this issue is a major concern in our study .",
    "the search for hzrgs will also constrain formation mechanisms for smbhs which are still very uncertain ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , a galaxy with a smbh at @xmath13 already implies that if its smbh is not primordial , then it must form within @xmath14gyr ( for @xmath15 km  s@xmath16  mpc@xmath16 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "only one hzrg is known at @xmath13 @xcite , and it is unclear whether hzrgs exist at earlier times . clearly , the discovery of more hzrgs will dramatically increase our knowledge of galaxy formation and smbh formation timescales .",
    "although the large optical and infrared telescopes which probe the distant universe are increasingly concentrated in the southern hemisphere , the search for hzrgs has until recently been limited to the northern hemisphere because of a lack of sensitive radio imaging surveys in the south .",
    "this has been rectified with near completion of the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 843  mhz which will be used , together with its forerunner the 408  mhz molonglo reference catalogue ( mrc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to search for the highest  redshift radio galaxies in the south .",
    "in this paper we present the results of a pilot study from sumss and the 1.4  ghz nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ? * ) .    our search for hzrgs consists of four steps : ( i ) definition of the sample , ( ii ) high - resolution radio imaging to obtain accurate positions and morphological information , ( iii ) near - ir identifications of the host galaxies , and ( iv ) optical and/or near - ir spectroscopy to measure their redshifts .",
    "here we present the results from the first three steps of our program .",
    "we used the 2001 november 23 pre - release version of the sumss catalogue @xcite , and version 39 of the nvss catalogue @xcite to construct a sample of ultra steep spectrum ( uss ) sources .",
    "note that this is a preliminary version of the sumss catalogue which has some differences ( see below ) from the first publicly  released version , version 1.0 of 2003 february 25 .",
    "the overlapping area with nvss comprises 29 sumss mosaics of 43 @xmath17 43 each . since we only consider sources with @xmath18(see  3.1 ) , the total sky area of our uss sample is 0.11 steradians , or 360deg@xmath1 .",
    "this area lies at @xmath19 , so galactic extinction should not be a problem in identifying the host galaxies .    to determine which search radius to adopt in our catalogue correlation , we plotted the density of nvss sources around sumss sources as a function of search radius ( fig .",
    "[ searchradius ] ) .",
    "we compared this distribution with the expected contribution from random correlations . to create a random position catalogue , we shifted the nvss positions by 1  in declination .",
    "this comparison indicates that at search radii @xmath2040 , there are no more correlations than expected from a random distribution . because we want our uss sample to be reliable , we used a 10  search radius . from fig .",
    "[ searchradius ] , we find that the density of nvss sources at offsets of 10  is @xmath4100@xmath17 higher than the random distribution , so we expect @xmath211 chance coincidence between a sumss and nvss source in our sample of 76 sources .",
    "using this cutoff , we exclude the 2.8% real sources with offsets @xmath2010 .",
    "the difference in resolution between sumss ( 45@xmath17 45cosec@xmath22 ) and nvss ( 45@xmath17 45 ) may cause a source to be resolved into two or more components in one catalogue , but not in the other between search radii of 40  and 55 . ] . since this would lead to spuriously steep spectral indices , we excluded those objects which had another source within 100 , which corresponds to 24% of the matched sample .",
    "this results in 9556 matches .",
    "the nvss positions are expected to be more accurate than the sumss positions in this declination zone , the sumss beam is 45@xmath17 81 , i.e.  significantly larger than the nvss beam in the n ",
    "s direction . ] , so we refer to the sources in common by their nvss name in the standard iau format .",
    "we used a spectral index is defined by the power law @xmath23 cutoff @xmath2 , calculated using the integrated sumss flux densities from the preliminary catalogue .",
    "we also imposed a flux limit of @xmath24  mjy to increase the accuracy of the spectral indices .",
    "of the 78 sources thus selected , we excluded two ( nvss  j000920@xmath25351354 and nvss  j012653@xmath25322807 ) which have bright foreground stars in the field , as this complicates optical and near - ir imaging .",
    "the final sample of 76 sources is listed in table  2 .",
    "note that 23 sources in our sample have spectral indices @xmath26 , and nominally fall outside our selection criterion .",
    "this is because in table  2 , we have used the integrated flux densities from version 1.0 of the sumss catalogue .",
    "this version calculates the integrated flux densities from the peak intensity and the widths of the gaussian fit using the same method as described by @xcite , while the preliminary version uses the raw output from the aips  task vsad ( t.  mauch , private communication ) . we have manually checked the integrated flux densities of all 76 sources directly from the sumss images , and conclude that the values in the version 1.0 catalogue are reliable ( there is no systematic difference , and no sources deviate by more than 25% ) .",
    "the difference between the integrated flux densities appears to be most significant for the largest radio sources ( using radio sizes determined from our atca imaging , see  3.1 ) , confirming that the preliminary catalogue systematically overestimated the integrated flux density .",
    "such errors show up easily in uss samples , as we select the sources with the largest differences between the sumss and nvss flux densities . in the following",
    ", we shall therefore only use the integrated flux densities from the version 1.0 catalogue .",
    "this implies that our sample contains only 53 real uss sources with @xmath2 .",
    "we have decided to retain the other 23 sources to provide a baseline in spectral index and radio size against which to search for correlations with other properties ( _ e.g. _  @xmath5band magnitude , redshift ) in our sample .",
    "when using version 1.0 of the sumss catalogue , we find a total of 212 sources with @xmath2 . of these sources , 69 are in new fields since added to the sumss coverage .",
    "the remaining 143 sources are all within the same fields , and qualify as uss sources due to the revised determination of the sumss flux density .",
    "most of these sources have just made it into the uss cutoff : the median spectral index of the 90 new sources is @xmath27 , while for the 53 uss sources in this paper , @xmath28 . because this new version of the sumss catalogue became available only after our radio and near  ir observations , these new sources are not considered here .",
    "we searched for obvious optical and @xmath5band identifications at the nvss positions using the digitized sky survey ( dss ) and the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "of the five sources detected in the dss , three were also seen in 2mass .",
    "we did not obtain more accurate radio or @xmath5band identifications for these sources , as they are likely to be located at low ( @xmath29 ) redshifts . as a result",
    ", we lack @xmath5band information for two sources , and for these , we quote the 2mass 10@xmath30 sensitivity limit . for the three sources detected in 2mass , we quote their total magnitudes from fit extrapolation and list these in column  10 of table  2 .",
    "four sources have measured spectroscopic redshifts @xmath31 from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these are listed in column  13 of table  2 .",
    "we used the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) over the period ut 2001 december 1214 to measure accurate radio positions and morphologies of 71 sources in our uss sample .",
    "the 6a configuration was used , spanning baselines from 330 m to 6 km .",
    "we observed simultaneously at 1.344  ghz and 1.432  ghz , and obtained 410 cuts of 3  minutes for each target , spread in hour angle .",
    "primary flux calibration was based on observations of pks  b1934@xmath25638 and the phase calibrators were pks  b1933@xmath25400 , b2341@xmath25351 and b0153@xmath25410 . to avoid high azimuth tracking speeds , we excluded sources near the local zenith by limiting our sample to @xmath18 .",
    "we used the caonis on - line data - reduction tool to determine if a source was detected with sufficient signal / noise ( s / n ) .",
    "once a source had been clearly detected , and its morphology determined , we skipped to the next source , with the aim of obtaining a set of radio maps with a uniform s / n level and uv - coverage .",
    "table  [ journal ] gives the total on - source integration times for each source .",
    "the resulting synthesized beam widths are @xmath32 , and the positional accuracy is estimated to be @xmath33 .",
    "we followed standard data reduction procedures in miriad , and combined the 1.344  ghz and 1.432  ghz uv - data to increase the signal - to - noise and better sample the uv - plane .",
    "the final images have a rms noise level of @xmath40.4  mjy .    for approximately 30% of our sample ,",
    "positive @xmath5band identifications were confused by several sources located near the radio derived positions .",
    "we therefore obtained follow - up radio observations to increase the sensitivity of the previous images .",
    "we re - observed 20 uss sources on ut 2003 july 2930 in the 6a configuration .",
    "we observed simultaneously at 1.384  ghz and 2.368  ghz and obtained 78 cuts of 46  minutes for each target , spread over 12 hours in hour angle .",
    "the phase calibrators observed were pks  b1933@xmath25400 , b2254@xmath25367 , b0008@xmath25421 and b0153@xmath25410 .",
    "all other parameters and data reduction techniques are as described above .",
    "we obtained @xmath34band imaging of 70 sources from our sample on the nights of ut 2002 october 17 to 20 , using the new iris2 instrument @xcite at the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope at siding spring observatory .",
    "conditions were mostly photometric , but the seeing was highly variable on some nights .",
    "this led to a loss of sensitivity of up to 2 magnitudes when the @xmath34band seeing was 30 , as compared to good conditions with 10 seeing .",
    "we used typical integration times of 64  s , consisting of 8 co - adds of 8  s each in a 14-point random jitter pattern within a @xmath35 box .",
    "the detector is a 1024@xmath171024 hawaii hgcdte array , with a pixel scale of 0446/pixel , resulting in a @xmath36 field of view .",
    "we used the online data - reduction tool orac - dr @xcite to sky - subtract , register and sum our data .",
    "this allowed us to re - observe several of the sources which were not detected after a first 14-point dither pattern .",
    "this quick data reduction also allowed us to re - observe 8 sources where we did not detect the object due to loss of sensitivity during periods of bad seeing . in our final data reduction",
    ", we retained only data obtained with a @xmath34band seeing @xmath212.0 , except for 6 sources with @xmath37 .    [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , < , > , > , > \" , ]",

    "while this could be a wide double , we consider it more likely that the two sources are unrelated as there is no plausible optical or near - ir counterpart located between the two sources .",
    "the northern ( steep  spectrum ) source nvss  j001339@xmath25322445 is associated with a bright galaxy seen on both the dss and 2mass images , and so was not observed with the atca or aat .",
