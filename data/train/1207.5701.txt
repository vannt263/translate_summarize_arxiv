    "motivated by applications to vlsi design , chung , leighton and rosenberg  @xcite studied embeddings of graphs in books .",
    "a _ book _ consists of a line ( the _ spine _ ) and @xmath7 half - planes ( the _ pages _ ) , such that the boundary of each page is the spine . in a _ book embedding _ , each edge is drawn on a single page , and no edge crossings are allowed . in a _ book drawing _ ( or _ @xmath0-page drawing _ , if the book has @xmath0 pages ) , each edge is drawn on a single page , but edge crossings are allowed .    obviously every fixed graph can be embedded in a book with sufficiently many pages . on the other hand , it is desirable to do so using as few pages as possible . given a graph @xmath2 , the minimum @xmath0 such that @xmath2 can be embedded in a @xmath0-page book is the _ pagenumber _ ( or _ book thickness _ ) of @xmath2  @xcite . determining the pagenumber of an arbitrary graph is np - complete  @xcite , but some results are known for particular families of graphs .",
    "for instance , it is not difficult to prove that the pagenumber of the complete graph @xmath5 is @xmath8 . on the other hand , with few exceptions , the pagenumbers of the complete bipartite graphs @xmath9 are unknown ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "yannanakis proved  @xcite that four pages are always sufficient , and sometimes required , to embed a planar graph .",
    "when the number @xmath0 of pages is fixed , the goal is to minimize the number of crossings in a @xmath0-page drawing of an input graph .",
    "@xmath0-page crossing number _",
    "@xmath1 of a graph @xmath2 is the minimum number of crossings in a @xmath0-page drawing of @xmath2 .    clearly , a graph @xmath2 has @xmath10 if and only if it is outerplanar .",
    "equivalent to @xmath11-page drawings are _ circular drawings _ , in which the vertices are placed on a circle and all edges are drawn in its interior . in a similar vein , @xmath0-page drawings of @xmath12 can be alternatively viewed as a set of @xmath0 circular drawings of graphs @xmath13 @xmath14 , where the edge sets @xmath15 form a @xmath0-partition of @xmath16 . in other words",
    ", we assign each edge in @xmath16 to exactly one of the @xmath0 circular drawings . in figure",
    "[ fig : k7draw ] we illustrate a @xmath17-page drawing of @xmath18 .     a @xmath17-page drawing of @xmath18 with @xmath6 crossings.,width=529 ]    several computational approaches and heuristics for estimating ( or determining ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 have been devised ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "few exact results or nontrivial bounds are known , and very little is known about @xmath1 for @xmath21 .    although the special cases @xmath22 and @xmath6 have received considerable attention , the only thorough investigation of @xmath1 for arbitrary @xmath0 is the work by shahrokhi , skora , szkely , and vrto  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "shahrokhi et al .",
    "give general lower bounds for @xmath1 , for any graph @xmath2 .",
    "they also give lower and upper bounds for @xmath3 , and use their upper bounds for @xmath3 to give general upper bounds for @xmath1 for arbitrary graphs @xmath2 .",
    "as with every graph - theoretical parameter , there is a natural interest in computing ( or at least estimating ) the @xmath0-page crossing number of the complete graph @xmath5 . besides , estimates on @xmath3 are an essential tool to derive bounds for @xmath1 for other graphs @xmath2 , via the embedding method .",
    "this is the approach followed by sharokhi et al .  in  @xcite , where the constructions that yield their upper bounds for @xmath3 are used to generate @xmath0-page drawings of dense graphs , whose number of crossings is within a constant factor of their @xmath0-page crossing number .",
    "our main contributions in this paper are improved lower bounds for the @xmath0-page crossing numbers of @xmath5 .",
    "we also compute the exact value of @xmath3 for several @xmath0 and @xmath4 ( no exact values were previously known for any @xmath4 , for any @xmath21 ) .    in section",
    "[ sec : surv1 ] we survey the bounds and exact results known for @xmath3 . in section [ sec : maxcutformulation ] we show how @xmath3 may be obtained from the solution of a maximum-@xmath0-cut problem on a suitable graph , or via the solution of a suitable weighted maximum satisfiability problem .",
    "these reformulations are used in section [ sec : numerical results ] to obtain previously unknown exact values and improved lower bounds on @xmath3 for various values of @xmath0 and @xmath4 via computation . in section  [ sec :",
    "upperbounds ] we review the construction that gives the best upper bounds available for @xmath3 , calculate the resulting number of crossings , and analyze this upper bound in the light of the new results obtained in the previous sections .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concludingremarks ] we present some concluding remarks and open questions .",
    "calculating the @xmath11-page crossing number of @xmath5 is straightforward . indeed , it is obvious that , in every @xmath11-page drawing of @xmath5 , every four vertices define a crossing , and therefore @xmath23 .",
    "it is easy to give @xmath11-page drawings with exactly @xmath24 crossings , and so the reverse inequality @xmath25 follows .",
    "it follows that the problem of calculating or estimating @xmath3 is only of interest for @xmath26 .",
    "we recall that the _ crossing number _",
    "@xmath27 of a graph @xmath2 is the minimum number of crossings in a drawing of @xmath2 in the plane .",
    "harary and hill  @xcite described how to draw @xmath5 in the plane with @xmath28 crossings , where @xmath29    no drawings of @xmath5 with fewer than @xmath28 crossings are known , and to this date the harary - hill conjecture @xmath30 is still open ( it has been settled only for @xmath31 ; see  @xcite ) .",
    "the drawings given in  @xcite are not @xmath6-page drawings , but it was later noticed that @xmath6-page drawings with @xmath28 crossings do exist  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this observation gave rise to the conjecture @xmath32 , popularized by vrto  @xcite .",
    "buchheim and zheng  @xcite proved that @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "recently , de klerk and pasechnik  @xcite verified that @xmath33 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and used semidefinite programming techniques to give asymptotic estimates on @xmath38 .",
    "more recently , brego et al .  proved that @xmath32 for every @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "much less is known of the @xmath0-page crossing number @xmath3 for @xmath40 .",
    "as we mentioned above , blaek and koman  @xcite seemed to have been the first to construct @xmath6-page drawings of @xmath5 with @xmath28 crossings . in the same paper they briefly observed that their construction could be extended to @xmath0 pages .",
    "although no details were given , they gave the number of crossings obtained for the case @xmath41 ( see section  [ sub : keq3 ] ) .",
    "damiani , dantona and salemi proposed a way to draw @xmath5 on @xmath0 pages  @xcite , using the adjacency matrix representation ( we call this the _ dds construction _ ) .",
    "they included a table with the resulting number of crossings for @xmath35 , and all @xmath42 ( recall that @xmath43 if @xmath44 ) .",
    "the exact number of crossings resulting from their construction was not explicitly given ( we have calculated this number ; see proposition  [ pro : calcu ] ) . the ( table )",
    "results given in  @xcite coincide for the case @xmath41 with the expression given by blaek and koman .",
    "although blaek and koman did not explain in detail their proposed construction for @xmath21 , it is not difficult to fill out the details ; by doing so , one can confirm that the ( or , at least , one possible ) natural way to generalize their construction for @xmath21 yields precisely the dds construction .    in  @xcite , shahrokhi et al .",
    "described a construction that draws @xmath5 on @xmath0 pages .",
    "this is also a natural generalization of the blaek - koman construction to @xmath40 pages .",
    "moreover , it agrees with the dds construction whenever @xmath0 divides @xmath4 ( the dds construction yields slightly better results for other values of @xmath0 and @xmath4 ) . based on their construction , shahrokhi et al",
    ".  gave the following general upper bound : @xmath45    in section  [ sec : upperbounds ] we include a detailed discussion on the dds construction , including the calculation of the number of crossings that result by drawing @xmath5 on @xmath0 pages using this paradigm .",
    "shahrokhi et al .  proved in  @xcite that for every graph @xmath2 and every positive integer @xmath0",
    ", one has @xmath47 . following the derivation of this bound",
    ", it is easy to see that the factor @xmath48 in this expression can be improved , but only marginally so . applying this bound to @xmath5",
    ", we obtain @xmath49    this lower bound can be improved if @xmath4 is sufficiently large compared to @xmath0 , as follows .",
    "we recall that a @xmath0-planar drawing is similar to a @xmath0-page drawing , but involves @xmath0 unrestricted planar drawings .",
    "formally , let @xmath50 be a graph . a @xmath0-_planar drawing _ of @xmath2 is a set of @xmath0 planar drawings of graphs @xmath13 @xmath14 , where the edge sets @xmath15 form a @xmath0-partition of @xmath16 .",
    "loosely speaking , to obtain the @xmath0-planar drawing , we take the drawings of the graphs @xmath51 , and ( topologically ) identify the @xmath0 copies of each vertex .",
    "the @xmath0-_planar crossing number _",
    "@xmath52 of @xmath2 is the minimum number of crossings in a @xmath0-planar drawing of @xmath2 .    if @xmath0 is even , then it is easy to obtain , from a @xmath0-page drawing of a graph @xmath2 , a @xmath53-planar drawing of @xmath2 with the same number of crossings .",
    "therefore @xmath54 for every graph @xmath2 and any positive even integer @xmath0 . in  @xcite ,",
    "shahrokhi et al .  proved that for all @xmath55 and all @xmath56 , @xmath57    from our previous observation , it follows that for all @xmath58 and all even @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "obviously @xmath61 for any graph @xmath2 and any integer @xmath26 , and so for any odd @xmath46 and any @xmath62 we have @xmath63 .",
    "now in their exhaustive investigation of biplanar ( @xmath6-planar ) crossing numbers  @xcite , czabarka , skora , szkely , and vrto prove the slightly better bound ( for the @xmath6-planar , or _ biplanar _ crossing number ) @xmath64 . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath65 . putting all these results together ,",
    "we obtain the following lower bounds :    @xmath66      the following type of result is well - known and easily shown ; see e.g. @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) .",
    "[ cla : claima ] for any integers @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69    as a consequence , the sequence @xmath70 is monotonically non - decreasing in @xmath4 . since it is also bounded from above by , the limit exists , and using and one has : @xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73",
    "we will show that @xmath74 can be obtained by computing the maximum @xmath0-cut size in a certain graph @xmath75 , say , which is a certain subgraph of the complement of the line graph of @xmath5 .",
    "the same graph was used in @xcite to investigate @xmath76 , and the general construction of graphs of this type is due to buchheim and zheng @xcite .    to define the graph @xmath75 , we consider a hamiltonian cycle @xmath77 with vertices @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath79 be the set of _ chords _ of the cycle , that is , the edges @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 at cyclic distance at least @xmath6 .",
    "let us say that the chords @xmath80 and @xmath83 _ overlap _ if @xmath84 occur in this cyclic order as we traverse @xmath77 , either in its natural or in its reverse direction . finally , to define @xmath85 , we let two chords @xmath80 and @xmath83 be adjacent if they overlap .    thus one has @xmath86 , and it is easy to verify that @xmath87 .",
    "the automorphism group of @xmath88 is isomorphic to the dihedral group @xmath89 on @xmath4 elements , and there are @xmath90 orbits of vertices , where @xmath91 .",
    "the equivalency classes of vertices ( i.e.  orbits ) may be described as follows : since vertices correspond to chords in @xmath77 , the chords that connect vertices of @xmath77 at the same cyclic distance belong to the same equivalency class .",
    "if @xmath4 is odd , then the vertices corresponding to chords with cyclic distance @xmath92 have valency @xmath93 , as is easy to check .    for later use",
    ", we will label the vertices of @xmath88 so that its adjacency matrix is partitioned into symmetric circulant blocks . to this end , consider the cycle @xmath77 with vertices numbered @xmath94 in the usual way .",
    "the vertices of @xmath88 that correspond to chords connecting points at cyclic distance @xmath92 are now labeled successively , starting with the chord @xmath95 and then obtaining the next chords in the ordering via clockwise cyclic shifts .",
    "thus the adjacency matrix of @xmath88 is partitioned into a block structure , where each row of blocks is indexed by a cyclic distance @xmath96 , and each block has size @xmath97 .",
    "moreover , one may readily verify that block @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) is given by the symmetric @xmath100 circulant matrix with first row    @xmath101,\\ ] ]    where @xmath102 and @xmath103 denote the all - ones and all - zeroes vectors in @xmath104 , respectively , and @xmath105 we may now relate the maximum @xmath0-cut problem for @xmath88 to @xmath3 .",
    "[ lem : reform ] one has @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes the cardinality of a maximum @xmath0-cut in @xmath88 .    first of all , recall that the maximum @xmath0-cut problem for @xmath12 may be seen as a vertex coloring problem , where the vertices @xmath108 are colored with @xmath0 colors in such a way that the number of edges with differently colored endpoints is maximized .",
    "consider a fixed @xmath0-page drawing of @xmath5 , viewed as @xmath0 circular drawings .",
    "fix a set of @xmath0 colors .",
    "assign the edges on page @xmath92 of the drawing the @xmath92th color @xmath109 .",
    "this defines a @xmath0-partition ( or @xmath0-coloring ) of the vertices @xmath79 of @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , the number of edges in @xmath85 with endpoints of the same color equals the number of crossings in the drawing , by construction .    as a consequence of this lemma",
    ", one may calculate @xmath74 for fixed ( in practice , sufficiently small ) values of @xmath4 by solving a maximum cut problem .",
    "this was done by buchheim and zheng @xcite for @xmath110 and @xmath111 , by solving the maximum cut problem with a branch - and - bound algorithm . using the biqmac solver  @xcite , de klerk and pasechnik @xcite computed the exact value of @xmath112 for @xmath35 and for @xmath113 .",
    "we follow the standard practice to use @xmath114 ( respectively , @xmath115 ) to denote the space of @xmath116 matrices over @xmath117 ( respectively , @xmath118 ) . for @xmath119 ,",
    "the notation @xmath120 means that @xmath121 is symmetric positive semidefinite , whereas for @xmath122 , it means that @xmath121 is hermitian positive semidefinite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a graph with @xmath123 vertices , and let @xmath124 be its laplacian matrix .",
    "frieze and jerrum introduced the following semidefinite programming - based upper bound on @xmath125 : @xmath126 where @xmath127 denotes the all - ones matrix of order @xmath123 .    for @xmath110 this",
    "bound coincides with the maximum - cut bound of goemans and williamson @xcite .",
    "the associated dual semidefinite program takes the form : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the operator that maps a @xmath123-vector to a @xmath130 diagonal matrix in the obvious way .",
    "using the technique of symmetry reduction for semidefinite programming ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , one can simplify the dual problem ( [ dual gw ] ) for the graphs @xmath88 defined in section  [ sec : maxcutformulation ] , by using the dihedral automorphism group of @xmath88 .",
    "we state the final expression as the following lemma .",
    "the proof is very similar to that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4 ) , and we therefore only give an outline .",
    "[ lemma : reformulation sdp ] let @xmath131 be an odd integer and @xmath132 .",
    "one has @xmath133 subject to @xmath134 where @xmath135    assume that @xmath136 are optimal in for @xmath137 and denote the laplacian matrix of @xmath88 by @xmath124 .",
    "we now project the posititive semidefinite matrix @xmath138 onto the centralizer ring of @xmath139 , via the reynolds projection operator ( or group average ) , say @xmath140 : @xmath141 where the matrices @xmath142 are given by the permutation matrix representation of @xmath139 .",
    "note that this projection preserves positive semidefiniteness as well as entrywise nonnegativity .",
    "moreover , as explained in section [ sec : maxcutformulation ] , we may assume that @xmath143 is a block matrix consisting of symmetric circulant blocks of order @xmath4 .",
    "also note that the projection @xmath144 simply averages the components of @xmath145 over the @xmath90 orbits of @xmath146 . denoting the average of the @xmath145 components in orbit @xmath92 by @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) , and @xmath149",
    ", we obtain @xmath150 since @xmath151 .",
    "thus we have obtained the reformulation @xmath152 where @xmath153 denotes the centralizer ring of @xmath139 , i.e.  the matrix @xmath154-algebra consisting of matrices of order @xmath155 that are partitioned into symmetric circulant blocks of order @xmath4 .",
    "we may now reduce this formulation further by using the discrete fourier transform matrix to simultaneously diagonalize the circulant blocks of @xmath156 and @xmath124 .    to this end , let @xmath157 denote the ( unitary ) discrete fourier transform matrix of order @xmath4 .",
    "condition ( [ lmi ] ) is equivalent to @xmath158 since the unitary transform involving @xmath157 diagonalizes any circulant matrix ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the matrix @xmath159 becomes a block matrix where each @xmath97 block is diagonal , with diagonal entries of block @xmath98 given by the eigenvalues of the circulant matrix with first row given by    @xmath160 & \\mbox{if $ i \\neq j$ } \\\\ &",

    "also , clearly one has @xmath161    finally , the rows and columns of the left hand side of ( [ lmi2 ] ) may now be re - ordered to form a block diagonal matrix with @xmath4 diagonal blocks , each of size @xmath162 .",
    "only @xmath163 of these @xmath4 blocks are distinct , and these correspond to the left - hand - side matrices in .",
    "the matrices @xmath164 @xmath165 in correspond to the distinct blocks obtained from the reordering of @xmath166 into block - diagonal form .",
    "in particular , we use @xmath167 to denote element @xmath168 of the first row of the symmetric circulant block @xmath98 of @xmath156 .    a few remarks on lemma [ lemma : reformulation sdp ] :    1 .",
    "note that we obtain a reduced semidefinite program with @xmath132 linear matrix inequalities involving matrices of order @xmath90 , as well as @xmath163 nonnegative matrix variables of order @xmath90 .",
    "this should be compared to the original formulation to obtain @xmath169 , that involved a linear matrix inequality of order @xmath170 , as well as a nonnegative matrix variable of the same order .",
    "2 .   lemma [ lemma : reformulation sdp ] generalizes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4 ) to include the case @xmath21 , but also refines it in the sense that the dihedral symmetry of the graph @xmath88 is fully exploited . indeed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4 ) , only the cyclic part of @xmath139 was used , leading to ( complex ) hermitian linear matrix inequalities , as opposed to the real symmetric linear matrix inequalities of lemma [ lemma : reformulation sdp ] .",
    "3 .   the computation of @xmath169 is simpler in the case @xmath110 , since the bound then becomes the goemans - williamson maximum cut bound .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , values of @xmath171 were reported for @xmath4 close to @xmath172 . for @xmath40 , one",
    "is limited to more modest values : the largest value of @xmath4 for which we will report computational results will be @xmath173 ; see section [ sec : numerical results ] .",
    "the difference in size of @xmath4 that may be handled is primarily due to the nonnegative matrix variables @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "these variables may be eliminated if @xmath110 , but not if @xmath40 .",
    "it is well - known that the maximum @xmath0-cut problem may be reformulated as a maximum satisfiability problem , and we will use this reformulation later on for computational purposes .",
    "consider a graph @xmath50 and a set of @xmath0 colors ( used to color the vertices @xmath108 ) .",
    "we define the following logical variables : @xmath176    consider the clause : @xmath177 for each color @xmath178 . for a given edge , and a given color ,",
    "this clause is satisfied if and only if the endpoints of the edge are not both colored using this color .",
    "moreover , each vertex should be assigned a color : @xmath179    in order to obtain the maximum @xmath0-cut in @xmath2 , we therefore need values of the logical variables that satisfy all the clauses , and as many of the clauses as possible . this may be done by solving a weighted maximum satisfiability problem , where the weights of the satisfied clauses is maximized . in order to guarantee that the clauses are all satisfied , we assign these clauses weight @xmath180 , while the clauses are assigned weight @xmath11 .",
    "thus the cardinality of a maximum @xmath0-cut in @xmath12 coincides with the maximum weight of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment for the weighted logical formula : @xmath181    we may now apply this idea to obtain @xmath3 as follows .    [ lemma : maxsat ] consider the set of weighted clauses for the graph @xmath182 .",
    "then @xmath3 is the minimum weight of the unsatisfied clauses , taken over all possible truth assignments .",
    "the proof follows directly from lemma [ lem : reform ] .",
    "it is possible to compute @xmath3 exactly using software for the weighted maximum satisfiablity problem in lemma [ lemma : maxsat ] . in table",
