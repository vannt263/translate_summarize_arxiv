    "the concepts of the specification and shadowing properties were born during studies on topological and measure - theoretic properties of axiom a diffeomorphisms ( see @xcite and @xcite by rufus bowen , who was motivated by some earlier works of anosov and sinai ) .",
    "later it turned out that there are many very strong connections between specification properties and the structure of the space of invariant measures .",
    "for example in @xcite , sigmund showed that if a dynamical system has the periodic specification property , then : the set of measures supported on periodic points is dense in the space of invariant measures ; the set of ergodic measures , the set of non - atomic measures , the set of measures positive on all open sets , and the set of measures vanishing on all proper closed invariant subsets are complements of sets of first category in the space of invariant measures ; the set of strongly mixing measures is a set of first category in the space of invariant measures .    a classical result of bowen ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 23.20 ) ) states that if a dynamical system with the shadowing property is expansive and topologically mixing then it has the periodic specification property .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that expansiveness of dynamics allows to conclude the uniqueness of some approximate trajectories and the existence of periodic points in the above result .",
    "therefore it is interesting to expect some connections between the shadowing property ( without expansiveness ) and properties of the space of invariant measures .    in general , it may happen that a dynamical system with the shadowing property does not have any periodic point , however moothathu proved in @xcite that the collection of uniformly recurrent points is dense in the non - wandering set , and later moothathu and oprocha proved in @xcite that the collection of regularly recurrent points is dense in the non - wandering set .",
    "they also asked in @xcite whether there always exists a point whose orbit closure is an odometer . here",
    "we give a positive answer to this question .",
    "in fact , we show that if a dynamical system has the shadowing property , then the collection of points whose orbit closures are odometers is dense in the non - wandering set .",
    "if in addition the dynamical system is transitive , then we can show that collection of ergodic measures which are supported on odometers is dense in the space of invariant measures .",
    "our first main result is the following .",
    "[ thm : a ] suppose that a dynamical system @xmath4 is transitive and has the shadowing property . then the collection of ergodic measures which are supported on odometers is dense in the space of invariant measures of @xmath4 . in particular ergodic measures",
    "are generic in the space of invariant measures .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite that if the collection of ergodic measures is dense in the space of invariant measures then the dynamical system must be transitive .",
    "so transitivity is a necessary assumption in theorem  a.    using theorem a , we can show that if a dynamical system @xmath4 is transitive with @xmath5 being infinite and has the shadowing property then the space of invariant measure has many properties in common with the case of dynamical systems with the specification property .",
    "for example the set of non - atomic measures and the set of measures positive on all open sets are complements of sets of first category in the space of invariant measures ; the set of strongly mixing measures is a set of first category in the space of invariant measures .",
    "a direct consequence of theorem a is that the collection of ergodic measures with zero entropy is dense in the space of invariant measures",
    ". if in addition the entropy function ( with respect to invariant measures ) is upper semi - continuous , then ergodic measures with zero entropy are generic in the space of invariant measures . in @xcite",
    ", we proved that weak mixing together with the shadowing property imply the specification property with a special kind of regularity in tracing ( a weaker version of periodic specification property ) . using ideas in the proof of theorem  a",
    ", we can show that the orbit closure of the tracing point is an odometer , answering the question  1 in  @xcite .",
    "another important consequence of the specification property is that , if the entropy function is upper semi - continuous then every invariant measure @xmath6 can be presented as a weak limit of ergodic measures @xmath7 and additionally entropies converge , that is @xmath8 and @xmath9 , e.g. see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  b ) .",
    "it is well known that if a dynamical system is expansive then the entropy function is upper semi - continuous .",
    "unfortunately , it many cases it happens that the entropy function is not automatically upper semi - continuous , hence many authors use some forms of expansiveness to ensure upper semi - continuity of entropy function and obtain the above convergence , e.g. see @xcite or weaker versions of expansiveness such as @xmath10-expansiveness in @xcite or asymptotically @xmath10-expansiveness in @xcite .",
    "note also that if the entropy function is upper semi - continuous then the system admits an ergodic invariant measure with maximal entropy .",
    "recently , many authors were interested in weakening specification property in such a way that the entropy approximation is still possible .",
    "an important example of this type is the paper by pfister and sulivan @xcite who introduced a very weak version of specification property and proved that it suffices to show results on entropy analogous to these mentioned above ( in particular @xmath11 ) .",
    "as we will show , in the case of dynamical systems with the shadowing property it is always possible to obtain the convergence of entropy , even in the case that there does not exist any measure of maximal entropy ( the entropy function is not upper semi - continuous ) . strictly speaking ,",
    "the second main result of the paper is the following .",
    "suppose that a dynamical system @xmath4 is transitive and has the shadowing property .",
    "then for every invariant measure @xmath6 on @xmath4 and every @xmath12 there exists a sequence of ergodic measures @xmath13 of @xmath4 supported on almost 1 - 1 extensions of odometers such that @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "a direct consequence of theorem b is the following corollary .",
    "suppose that a dynamical system @xmath4 is transitive and has the shadowing property .",
    "the following conditions hold :    1 .   for every @xmath16 and @xmath1 the collection of ergodic measures , supported on almost 1 - 1 extensions of odometers , with entropy between @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "is dense in the space of invariant measures with entropy at least @xmath2 .",
    "2 .   if the entropy function is upper semi - continuous , then for every @xmath16 ergodic measures with entropy @xmath2 are generic in the space of invariant measures with entropy at least @xmath2 .",
    "note that the conclusion of corollary c is much stronger than the condition ( d ) in @xcite , that is the graph of the restriction of the entropy function to ergodic measures is dense in the graph . in (",
    "* theorem 1 ) , comman gave several equivalent conditions to the condition ( d ) and explained their applications in large deviation theory .",
    "so if a dynamical system @xmath4 is transitive and has the shadowing property then it has some consequences in large deviation theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ] , we give some preliminaries . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we show the existence of odometers in dynamical systems with the shadowing property and provide a method of approximation of invariant measures by ergodic measures supported on odometers . then we prove theorem a and its consequences . in section  [ sec :",
    "almost11 ] , we provide a delicate method of approximation of invariant measures by ergodic measures supported on almost 1 - 1 extensions of odometers with arbitrary lower entropy .",
    "theorem b is proved there .",
    "section  [ sec:5 ] contains examples of systems with the shadowing property but without the specification property , highlighting possible applications of previously mentioned results . in section  [ sec:6 ] ,",
    "we provide the following example .",
    "[ thm : shad : mme ] there exists a transitive dynamical system @xmath4 with the shadowing property such that @xmath17 for every invariant measure @xmath18 .",
