    "when it comes to the ultimate physical limit of a computer , two questions arise immediately : how much information can it store , and how fast can it run @xcite ?",
    "the former is related to the famous boltzmann s entropy formula that restricts the number of ( qu)bits available to a physical system @xcite .",
    "the latter concerns the speed of quantum evolution , and is limited by the remarkable time - energy uncertainty relation : @xmath0 with the two bounds usually referred to as mandelstam - tamm @xcite and margolus - levitin @xcite types , respectively .",
    "this fundamental relation determines that it takes at least @xmath1 , the so - called quantum speed limit ( qsl ) time , to evolve to an orthogonal state for a quantum system with energy spread @xmath2 or average energy @xmath3 .",
    "this qsl time has been proved to be tight @xcite , can be extended to nonorthogonal state cases @xcite , and plays an important role in a great deal of quantum tasks such as quantum computation @xcite , quantum communication @xcite , quantum optimal control optimal control , and quantum metrology @xcite .    due to the inevitable coupling to the surrounding environment , quantum systems are usually treated as open @xcite .",
    "significant experimental progress has been made in controlling the dynamics of open systems @xcite . how to detect the limit to quantum non - unitary evolution of open systems now becomes paramountly important . in recent years",
    ", efforts have been made towards the description of qsl time in the evolution of open systems @xcite .",
    "a unified lower bound , including both mandelstam - tamm and margolus - levitin types , has been derived by deffner and lutz @xcite . by von neumann trace inequality and cauchy - schwarz inequality , the qsl time between an initial open system state @xmath4 and its target state @xmath5 , governed by the time - dependent non - unitary equation @xmath6 with @xmath7 a super - operator , is given by @xmath8where @xmath9 /e_{\\tau } ^{p } , $ ] @xmath10 and @xmath11 denotes the schatten @xmath12-norm , @xmath13 are the singular values of @xmath14 , and @xmath15 denotes the bures angle between the initial pure state @xmath16 and the target state @xmath5 .",
    "to study the environmental effects on qsl time , one method is to evaluate the characteristic of the intrinsic speed of the quantum evolution , i.e. , given a driving time , how fast can a quantum system evolve .",
    "interestingly , it is discovered that non - markovian effect can speed up the quantum evolution with a damped jaynes - cummings model for an atom resonantly coupled to a leaky single mode cavity : qsl decreases when the non - markovian effect becomes stronger @xcite .",
    "several questions , however , naturally arise : ( i ) is the speedup phenomenon a rather general feature which also exists in other physical models ? ( ii ) is non - markovianity the only key factor for speeding up quantum evolution ?",
    "( iii ) what is the mechanism for quantum acceleration in memory environments ?    to address these questions ,",
    "in this paper , we consider a two - level atom embedded in a photonic crystal cavity ( pcc ) with the periodic dielectric structures forming photonic band gaps ( pbg ) @xcite . this structured reservoir has been widely used to form atom - photon bound states @xcite , strong localization of light @xcite , as well as entanglement preservation @xcite . in this",
    "setting , the transition from no - speedup to speedup of quantum evolution is observed when the atomic frequency is approaching and going inside the band edge .",
    "qsl time is found to be related to two quantities : non - markovianity during the driving time and excited population at @xmath17 .",
    "we illustrate that it is the competition between the two quantities that ultimately determines the speedup of quantum evolution .",
    "finally , a possible experimental realization for our illustrated phenomena by a single nitrogen - vacancy ( n - v ) center embedded in a two - dimensional pcc is discussed .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the physical model with a two - level atom embedded in a pcc and derive the relevant qsl time in sec . iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we explore the mechanism for the speedup of quantum evolution and suggest a pcc - n - v based experimental proposal in sec .",

    "when the atom transition frequency goes far outside the band gap ( e.g. , @xmath68 ) , the qsl time is actually the driving time .",
    "however , a remarkable phenomenon appears when the atom transition frequency is approaching and going inside the band edge ( @xmath69 ) , the qsl time @xmath65 will begin to decrease , implying the intrinsic speedup of quantum evolution .",
    "obviously , the deeper the atomic transition frequency lies in the band edge , the smaller the qsl time will be in a general trend . on the other hand , if the driving time is not very long , e.g. , in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the speedup phenomenon only occurs inside the band edge ( @xmath70 ) , which is quite different from fig .",
    "1(b)@xmath71(d ) , where the speedup region lies even outside the band edge .",
    "how can we explain the above phenomena ?",
    "can we claim that the reason for the speedup in the above model is solely due to the memory ( non - markovian ) effect of the reservoir ? to answer these questions , in the following we first describe the non - markovian behavior of the evolution of this model .",

    "the non - markovianity is defined as the total backflow of information @xcite @xmath79with the maximization over all initial state pairs @xmath80 .",
    "there exists no general analytical method to find the optimal initial state pair @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will use numerical calculations instead .",
    "[ red ( dark gray ) curves ] and excited population @xmath81 [ light blue ( light gray ) curves ] and as a function of @xmath82 in the case of @xmath83 ( in unit of @xmath84 ) in @xmath64 respectively@xmath85,width=326 ]    in fig .",
    "2 , the integrals @xmath86 in the definition of @xmath87 of 2000 random initial state pairs @xmath80 [ green ( light gray ) curves ] are generated with @xmath88 as an example .",
    "clearly all these pairs yield smaller values than that of the state pair @xmath89 [ red ( dark gray ) curve ] .",
    "it is easy to check that for this optimal state pairs , the trace distance of the evolved states can be written as @xmath90 @xmath91 ( @xmath92 denotes the optimal trace distance in the following ) .",
    "based on this , we take the non - markovianity as @xmath93to associate the non - markovianity with the qsl time , we rewrite eq .",
    "( nonm ) as @xmath94 ,   \\label{nonm2}\\]]consequently , the qsl time is reduced to @xmath95clearly , the qsl time is related to two quantities : the non - markovianity @xmath87 within the driving time and the atomic excited population @xmath96 . as an illustration , the two quantities @xmath97 [ red ( dark gray ) curves ] and @xmath96 [ light blue ( light gray ) curves ] , as functions of @xmath67 are drawn in fig .",
    "3 .    equation ( [ qsl - monm ] ) implies that the transition point from no - speedup to speedup of quantum evolution is just the point when the markovian environment becomes non - markovian , for @xmath98 when @xmath99 it is therefore easy to account for the phenomenon that the speedup only takes place within the bandgap edge when @xmath100 [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , for the transition point from markovian to non - markovian environment just occurs inside the bandgap edge when the driving time is short [ fig .",
    "3(a ) ] .    equation ( [ qsl - monm ] ) also provides us with a route to explore the mechanism for the intrinsic speedup of quantum evolution . for illustration",
    ", we consider the driving time @xmath101 as an example [ fig .",
    "when the atom transition frequency is far outside the bandgap edge frequency ( e.g. , @xmath102 ) , the population will not be trapped , i.e. , @xmath103 and the non - markovianity also approaches zero , therefore , @xmath104 .",
    "when the atomic transition frequency is around the bandgap edge ( e.g. , @xmath105 $ ] ) , @xmath106 is dependent on both the population @xmath96 and non - markovianity @xmath107 for the atomic excited population is trapped , i.e. , @xmath108 and the non - markovianity is strong .",
    "finally , if the atomic transition frequency is deeply inside the bandgap edge ( e.g. , @xmath109 ) , the non - markovianity becomes small , and @xmath65 is mainly dependent on @xmath96 . summarizing , it is the competition between @xmath96 and @xmath110 that takes responsibility for the intrinsic speedup of quantum evolution .",
    "we note that our conclusion is not only restricted to the above physical model , it can also be used to explain the phenomenon illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the optimal trace distance for non - markovianity of a two - level atom resonantly coupled to a leaky single model cavity is found to be @xmath111 @xcite . since the monotonicity of @xmath112 and @xmath113 is the same , for simplicity , we still use @xmath113 as the trace distance ( not optimal ) for non - markovianity @xmath114 .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ qsl - monm ] ) still holds with @xmath97 replaced by @xmath115 it is easy to check that no population will be trapped , i.e. , @xmath116 when @xmath117 thus @xmath118which is inversely proportional to non - markovianity @xmath114 if @xmath17 is longer enough . in this case , when @xmath119 ( markovian ) , @xmath120 consequently , the non - markovian effect becomes the unique reason for speeding up quantum evolution in this model .",
    "and @xmath121 are employed as the two - level system coupled to the modes of the pcc with coupling constant g@xmath122,width=326 ]    in this section , we briefly discuss a possible experimental realization for testing the above phenomena using a composite isotropic planar pcc - n - v system [ shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) ] @xcite , where an external magnetic field * b * is applied along the [ 111 ] axis of the n - v center to lift the degeneracy between the states @xmath123 in our case , the ground state @xmath124 and the excited state @xmath125 are employed as the two - level open system coupled to the pcc with @xmath126 circular polarization mode , where @xmath127 refers to the orbital state with 0,@xmath128 orbital angular momentum projection nv - level , nv - ywl . in experiment ,",
    "the initial state of n - v center can be prepared by 532 nm laser pulse with high fidelity @xcite , and the finial state can be tested with standard tomography technique book qic . to control the transition frequency in order to observe the transition from no - speedup to speedup phenomenon",
    ", we may shift the frequency @xmath20 with stark effect . for the relevant experimental parameters ,",
    "the optical transition dipole moment and the typical transition frequency of the n - v center are observed to be @xmath129 @xcite and @xmath130 @xcite , which lead to @xmath131 we can tune the energy levels by the stark shift with @xmath132 nv - stark@xmath85 therefore , @xmath133 which is large enough to obverse the no - speedup to speedup transition ( e.g. , in fig .",
    "1(b ) , @xmath134 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "numerous experiments have successively demonstrated the strong coupling between n - v centers and the modes of gallium phosphide pcc @xcite , silicon nitride pcc @xcite , and pcc in monocrystalline diamond @xcite , respectively .",
    "these advances imply that this composite system is a suitable platform to test the results .",
    "though our present work mainly focuses on a specific open system model , further study on more complicated non - markovian systems characterized by other non - markovian master equations @xcite , e.g. , post - markovian master equation @xcite , will be of great interest and importance .    on the other hand ,",
    "as the non - markovian effect plays a significant role in the speedup of quantum evolution , one interesting question then arises : will non - markovianity also be associated with some other speed limits ? in quantum many - body systems , for instance , there exists a maximum speed of information propagation in discrete quantum systems with local interactions .",
    "this speed limit , known as lieb - robinson bound @xcite , has been extensively studied @xcite and was observed in experiment with a one - dimensional ultracold gas of bosonic atoms @xcite . since quantum systems",
    "are always subject to decoherence and dissipation in practice , recent studies of lieb - robinson bound have been extended to classical markovian dynamics @xcite as well as quantum markovian @xcite and non - markovian @xcite conditions .",
    "it is desirable to further investigate the effects of noise and memory environments on the lieb - robinson velocity bound , and the interplay between qsl and the lieb - robinson bound .    in summary , for a model of two - level atom embedded in a pbg structured reservoir , the transition from no - speedup to speedup of quantum evolution has been observed . in particular , we have established a linkage between the qsl time and non - markovianity as well as the population of excited states for a given driving time .",
    "we have found that it is the competition between the two quantities that finally determines the speedup of quantum evolution under noise .",
    "the phenomenon we illustrated in this work is finally analyzed by real pcc - n - v based experimental data .",
    "our approach may be of both theoretical and experimental interests in exploring the ultimate limits to quantum computers in memory environments .",
