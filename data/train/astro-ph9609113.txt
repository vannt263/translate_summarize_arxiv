    "the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method of distance determination works by measuring the ratio of the second and first moments of the stellar luminosity function in a galaxy .",
    "this ratio , called @xmath4 , is then the luminosity - weighted , average luminosity of a stellar population and is roughly equal to the luminosity of a single giant star . in terms of magnitudes ,",
    "this quantity is represented as @xmath5 , the absolute `` fluctuation magnitude . '' what we measure , of course , is the apparent fluctuation magnitude in a particular photometric band , in our case the @xmath0  band , . in order to be useful as a distance estimator ,",
    "must be calibrated , either empirically , by tying the measurements to the cepheid distance scale , or theoretically , according to stellar population synthesis models .",
    "tonry and schneider ( 1988 ) were the first to quantify the sbf phenomenon .",
    "their method was based on a measurement of the amount of power on the scale of the point spread function in the power spectrum of a ccd image .",
    "they applied this method to images of the galaxies m32 and ngc 3379 .",
    "subsequent work by tonry , luppino , and schneider ( 1988 ) and tonry , ajhar , & luppino ( 1989 , 1990 ) revised and refined the analysis techniques and presented further observations in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath0 of early - type galaxies in virgo , leo , and the local group .",
    "tonry et al .",
    "( 1990 ) found that the @xmath0  band was most suitable for measuring distances and attempted to calibrate the sbf method theoretically using the revised yale isochrones ( green , demarque , & king 1987 ) .",
    "there were obvious problems with this calibration , however , so a completely empirical calibration for  was presented by tonry ( 1991 ) .",
    "the calibration was based on the variation of  with  color in the fornax cluster and took its zero point from the cepheid distance to m31 .",
    "tonry used this calibration to derive the hubble constant .",
    "a detailed review of the modern sbf technique can be found in jacoby et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which also provides some historical context for the method .    in recent years",
    ", the sbf technique has been used to measure distances and study a variety of stellar populations in several different bands .",
    "@xmath8-band sbf observations have been reported by luppino & tonry ( 1993 ) , pahre & mould ( 1994 ) , and jensen , luppino , & tonry ( 1996 ) .",
    "these studies find that @xmath9 is also a very good distance estimator .",
    "dressler ( 1993 ) has measured @xmath0-band sbf in centaurus ellipticals , finding evidence in support of the great attractor model .",
    "lorenz et al .  (",
    "1993 ) have measured @xmath0-band sbf in fornax , and simard & pritchet ( 1994 ) have reported distances to two coma  i galaxies using @xmath6-band sbf observations .",
    "ajhar & tonry ( 1994 ) reported measurements of  and @xmath10 for 19 milky way globular clusters and considered the implications for both the distance scale and stellar populations .",
    "tiede , frogel , & terndrup ( 1995 ) measured  and @xmath10 for the bulge of the milky way and derived the distance to the galactic center .",
    "sodemann & thomsen ( 1995 , 1996 ) have used fluctuation colors and radial gradients to investigate stellar populations in galaxies .",
    "finally , an enormous amount of progress has been achieved on the theoretical sbf front through the stellar population models of worthey ( 1993a , b , 1994 ) , buzzoni ( 1993 , 1995 ) , and yi ( 1996 ) .",
    "when it became apparent that @xmath0-band sbf observations could indeed provide accurate and reliable distances to galaxies , we undertook a large survey of nearby galaxies .",
    "the sample selection is not precisely defined because the measurement of sbf depends on a number of criteria which are not ordinarily cataloged , such as dust content .",
    "in addition , because the measurement of sbf is fairly expensive in terms of telescope time and quality of seeing , it simply was not possible to observe all early - type galaxies within some magnitude limit out to a redshift which is large enough to make peculiar velocities negligible .",
    "nevertheless , we have tried to manage fairly complete coverage of early - type galaxies within 2000  km / s and brighter than @xmath11 , and we have significant coverage beyond those limits .",
    "comparison with the third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) reveals that of the early - type galaxies ( @xmath12 ) with @xmath13 in the rc3 , we have observed 76% with heliocentric velocity @xmath14  km / s , 73% with @xmath15 , 64% with @xmath16 , 49% with @xmath17 , and we have data for more than 40 galaxies with @xmath18  km / s .",
    "virtually all of the galaxies closer than @xmath19 where we lack data are s0s for which measuring sbf is complicated by dust and/or disk / bulge problems , and since many of them are in the cores of clusters such as virgo , we do not regard their distances as being important enough to delay completion of our survey .",
    "the survey is , however , an ongoing project , with some data still to be reduced . about 50% of our sample is listed as e galaxies ( @xmath20 ) , about 40% as s0s , and 10% as `` spirals '' ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "our sample of galaxies is drawn from the entire sky , and the completeness was mainly driven by the vicissitudes of weather and telescope time , so the sampling is fairly random .",
    "the survey includes a large number of galaxies in the vicinity of the virgo supercluster , and the next paper in this series will present an analysis of their peculiar motions .",
    "the following section describes the sbf survey in more detail , including the observations , photometric reductions , and consistency checks . in section 3",
    "we use our observations of galaxies in groups to derive the dependence of  on .",
    "seven of these groups also have cepheid distances , which we use to set the zero point of the   relation .",
    "this new  calibration agrees well with theory and supersedes the old calibration of tonry ( 1991 ) .",
    "we then compare our distances to those found using a number of other methods .",
    "in section 4 we discuss the tie to the large - scale hubble flow and implications for the value of @xmath22 .",
    "the final section provides a summary of our main conclusions .",
    "all in all , the sbf survey extends over some 40 observing runs at 6 telescopes .",
    "table 1 lists these runs along with some salient information . note",
    "that the date of the run is coded in the name as ( observatory)mmyy ; the remaining columns are described below .",
    "the normal observing procedure when the skies were clear was to obtain sky flats each night and observe a number of landolt standard stars .",
    "we preferred observing the faint standard star fields of landolt ( 1992 ) in which there are several stars per ccd field and where the observations are long enough that shutter timing is not a problem .",
    "table 2 gives our usual fields . during a typical night",
    "we would observe about 10 fields comprising perhaps 50 stars over a range of airmasses from 1.1 to 2.0 .",
    "we also strived to observe stars over a wide range of color ranging from @xmath23 .",
    "because there is substantial fringing seen in the @xmath0 band with thin ccds , at some point in a run we would spend several hours looking at a blank field in order to build up a `` fringe frame '' .",
    "we have found the fringing pattern for a given ccd and filter ( although not the amplitude ) to be remarkably stable from night to night ( even year to year ) .",
    "hence , a single fringe frame was used to correct an entire run s data , and we usually collected a new one for each run .",
    "the reductions of the photometry proceed by bias subtraction , flattening , and following landolt ( 1992 ) , summing the net flux from photometric standards within a 14  aperture .",
    "we also estimate a flux error from the sky brightness and variability over the image and remove any stars whose expected error is greater than 0.02 magnitude .",
    "once all the photometric observations from a run have been reduced , we fit the results according to @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the flux from the star in terms of electrons per second .",
    "we have found that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constant during a run with a given ccd and filter , so we fit for a single value for these parameters and extinction coefficients @xmath28 for each night .",
    "the rms residual of the fit is typically about 0.01 magnitude which is satisfactory accuracy for our purposes .",
    "table 1 lists typical values for @xmath26 , @xmath28 , and @xmath27 for each run in the two filters @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "note the havoc in the extinction caused by the eruption by pinatubo in 1991 .",
    "galaxy reductions proceed by first bias subtraction , division by a flat field , and subtraction of any fringing present in @xmath0 band data .",
    "we always take multiple images of a galaxy with the telescope moved by several arcseconds between images , and determine these offsets to the nearest pixel .",
    "any bad pixels or columns are masked out , and the images are shifted into registration .",
    "we next run a program called `` autoclean '' which identifies cosmic rays in the stack of images and removes them by replacement with appropriately scaled data from the rest of the stack .",
    "autoclean also gives us an estimate of how photometric the sequence of observations was by producing accurate flux ratios between the exposures .",
    "finally we make a mask of the obvious stars and companion galaxies in the cleaned image and determine the sky background by fitting the outer parts of the galaxy image with an @xmath29 profile plus sky level .",
    "this is usually done simultaneously for @xmath6 and @xmath0 images , and when the sky levels are determined , we also compute  colors as a function of radius from the center of the galaxy .    in order to knit all of our observations into a consistent photometric system",
    ", we attempted to make sure that there were overlap observations between runs , and we developed a pair of programs called `` apphot '' and `` apcomp '' to compare observations .",
    "`` apphot '' converts a galaxy image with its photometric calibration into a table of circular aperture photometry .",
    "this only depends on plate scale ( which is well known ) and therefore permits comparison of different images regardless of their angular orientation .",
    "`` apcomp '' then takes the aperture photometry from two observations and fits the two profiles to one another using a photometry scale offset and a relative sky level .",
    "these two programs can give us accurate offsets between the photometry of two images , good at the 0.005 magnitude level .",
    "we learned , however , that good seeing is much more common than photometric weather , and we realized that many of our `` photometric '' observations were not reliable at the 0.01 magnitude level .",
    "as the survey progressed and the number of overlaps increased , we also realized that although we only need 0.05 magnitude photometry of ,  is sensitive enough to  color that we needed better photometry .",
    "the existing photoelectric ( pe ) photometry , although probably very good in the mean , is neither extensive enough nor accurate enough to serve to calibrate the survey .",
    "we also became aware that there are many peculiar ccd and shutter effects which make good photometry difficult .",
    "for example , we have found photometry with tektronix ( site ) ccds particularly challenging for reasons we do not fully understand . because of their high quantum efficiency and low noise they have been the detectors of choice , but run to run comparisons with apphot and apcomp show consistent zero point offsets at the 0.05 magnitude level . while not a serious problem for , we had to do much better in measuring .",
    "accordingly , we undertook an auxiliary survey in 1995 of a substantial fraction of our sbf survey from the mcgraw - hill 1.3-m telescope at the mdm observatory .",
    "we shared the time with another program and used only nights which were photometric , as judged by the observer at the time and as revealed later from the quality of the photometric standard observations .",
    "we did not use tek ccds but primarily used the front - illuminated , loral 2048@xmath30 ccd wilbur ( metzger et al . 1993 ) , we used filters which match @xmath6 and @xmath31 as closely as possible , and the large field of view permitted us to make very good estimates of sky levels . over 5 runs this comprised about 600 observations in @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "we made certain to have a generous overlap between these observations and all our other observing runs , reaching well south to tie to the ctio and lco data .",
    "we then performed a grand intercomparison of all the photometric data in order to determine photometric offsets from run to run . using apphot and apcomp",
    ", we determined offsets between observations , and we built up a large table of comparison pairs .",
    "in addition , photoelectric ( pe ) photometry from devaucouleurs and longo ( 1988 ) , poulain and nieto ( 1994 ) , and buta and williams ( 1995 ) served as additional sources of comparison , and we computed differences between pe and our photometry for every galaxy in common .",
    "we have found that  colors often show somewhat better agreement than the individual @xmath6 and @xmath0 measurements , presumably because thin clouds are reasonably gray , so we also compared colors directly in addition to photometric zero points .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "in each of three quantities @xmath6 , @xmath0 , and , we fitted for zero point offsets for each run ( photoelectric sources were considered to be a `` run '' ) , minimizing the pairwise differences .",
    "we set the overall zero point by insisting that the median run offset be zero . upon completion",
    ", we found that the rms of the zero point offsets to be 0.029 mag , and the rms scatter of individual comparisons between ccd data to be 0.030 mag in @xmath6 , 0.026 mag in @xmath0 , and 0.024 mag in .",
    "the scatter was bigger for ccd - pe zero point comparisons , 0.047 mag in both @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "the `` zero point offsets '' for the photoelectric photometry were 0.003 mag in @xmath6 , 0.017 mag in @xmath0 , and 0.004 mag in , which we take to be close enough to zero that we did not choose to modify our overall median zero point to force them to zero .",
    "finally , we chose zero point corrections for @xmath6 and @xmath0 for each run according to these offsets .",
    "the difference of the corrections was set to the  offset from the comparison , and the sum of the corrections was the sum of the @xmath6 and @xmath0 offsets .",
    "we therefore believe that ( a ) our photometry is very close to landolt and photoelectric in zero point , ( b ) the error in the @xmath6 or @xmath0 photometry for a given observation is 0.02 mag , and ( c ) the error in a given color measurement is 0.017 mag ( where we have divided by @xmath32 to get the error for single measurements ) .",
    "we also add in quadrature 0.25 of the zero point offset which was applied .",
    "the offsets @xmath33 and @xmath34 for each run are listed in table 1 .",
    "the reductions of  are described elsewhere ( e.g. , jacoby et al .",
    "briefly , we fit a galaxy model to the summed , cleaned , sky - subtracted galaxy image and subtract it . if there is dust present ( all too common in ellipticals and s0s as well as the large bulge spiral galaxies we observe ) , we mask it out as well",
    ". experiments with masking different portions of m31 and m81 ( where we used @xmath35 band observations to show us clearly the location of the dust ) indicate that reasonable care in excising dust will produce a reliable , both because the extinction is less in the @xmath0 band and also because the dust tends to cause structure at relatively large scales which are avoided by our fit to the fourier power spectrum .",
    "we run dophot ( schechter et al . 1993 ) on the resulting image to find stars , globular clusters , and background galaxies ; fit a luminosity function to the results ; and derive a mask of objects brighter than a completeness limit and an estimate of residual variance from sources fainter than the limit . applying the mask to the model - subtracted image",
    ", we calculate the variance from the fluctuations in a number of different regions .",
    "finally , this variance is converted to a value for  by dividing by the mean galaxy flux and subtraction of the residual variance estimate from unexcised point sources .",
    "generally speaking , the various estimates of  are quite consistent from region to region , and a weighted average and error estimate are tabulated for each observation . if the observation was photometric , we also record the  color found in the same region in which we measure .",
    "there are many galaxies for which  and  have been measured more than once , and intercomparison of the different observations can be used to evaluate whether our error estimates are reasonable .",
    "if we consider all pairs and divide their difference by the expected error , the distribution should be a gaussian of unity variance .",
    "figure 2 illustrates these distributions for  and",
    ". evidently , the error estimates are usually quite good , with discordant observations occurring rarely . in most cases of discordances",
    ", it is clear which of the observations is trustworthy , and we simply remove the other observation from further consideration .",
    "these excised observations occur 1.5% of the time for  and 0.3% of the time for , and are an indication of how frequently bad observations occur .",
    "after observations are averaged together , they are subjected to some final corrections .",
    "the mean  color of the fluctuations is the mean of a galaxy s color  and the `` fluctuation color ''  , or @xmath36 ( since the rms fluctuation is the square root of the flux from the galaxy and the flux from ) .",
    "the value of  is corrected according to this mean color and the color term for the run s photometry .",
    "the values of  and  are corrected for galactic extinction according to @xmath37 where @xmath38 comes from burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) , who give @xmath39 , the relative extinction ratio @xmath40 is taken from cohen et al .",
    "( 1981 ) for a star halfway between an a0 and an m star , and @xmath41 is an adjustment of a value of 3.1 for a0 stars common in the literature ( _ e.g. , _ cardelli , et al .",
    "1989 ) to a value of 3.04 more appropriate for early - type galaxies , following the ratios given in cohen et al .",
    "the final modification is the application of k - corrections which brighten magnitudes in @xmath6 and @xmath0 by 1.9 and @xmath42 respectively ( schneider 1996 ) , and brighten fluctuation magnitudes in @xmath0 by @xmath43 ( worthey 1996 ) .",
    "note that the very red color of sbf causes flux to be shifted rapidly out of the @xmath0 band with redshift , but the  k - correction amounts to only 0.05 magnitude at a typical distance of 2000  km / s .",
    "the next step we take in trying to establish how  varies according to stellar population is to look at how  varies from galaxy to galaxy within groups , where the distance to the galaxies is essentially constant .",
    "we originally chose to observe sbf in the @xmath0 band because stellar population models indicate that  is relatively constant from population to population , and that the effects of age , metallicity , and imf are almost degenerate  in other words ,  is nearly a one parameter family",
    ".    guided by theoretical models we seek to establish whether three statements are a fair description of our data :    is a one - parameter family , with a universal dependence on ( i.e. ,  is a function of  with small residual scatter ) .    the zero point of the ",
    "relation is universal .",
    "the   relation is consistent with theoretical models of stellar populations .    to this end",
    "we chose approximately 40 nearby groups where we currently have ( or will have ) observed more than one galaxy .",
    "the groups are defined by position on the sky and a redshift range and in most cases correspond to one of the groups described by faber et al .",
    "table 3 lists our groups .",
    "note that we are not trying to include all groups , nor do we have to be complete in including all galaxies which are members .",
    "we are simply trying to create samples of galaxies for which we are reasonably confident that all galaxies are at the same distance .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the ",
    "relationship in six groups where we have measured sbf in a number of galaxies : ngc  1023 , leo , ursa major , coma  i&ii , virgo , and fornax .",
    "the lines are drawn with slope 4.5 and zero point according to the fit to the data described below .",
    "we see that galaxies which meet the group criteria of position on the sky and redshift are consistent with the same ",
    "relationship , where the scatter reflects both the measurement error and the group depth inferred from spread across the sky . in virgo",
    "we find ngc  4600 much brighter than the rest of the galaxies , ngc  4365 significantly fainter , and ngc  4660 ( the point at @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) also with an unusually bright  for its color .",
    "these three galaxies , marked as smaller , square symbols , are discussed below .",
    "note that ellipticals and s0 galaxies are intermixed with spirals ( ngc  3368 in leo , ngc  4548 in virgo , ngc  891 in the ngc  1023 group , and ngc  4565 and ngc  4725 in the coma  i&ii group ) .",
    "the two galaxies in fornax marked as `` spiral '' ( ngc  1373 and ngc  1386 ) might better be classified as s0 on our deep ccd images .",
    "for this admittedly small sample we see no offset between sbf measurements in spiral bulges and early - type galaxies .",
    "we regard this as confirmation of our assumption that sbf measurements are equally valid in spiral bulges as in early - type galaxies .    in order to test the hypothesis that  has a universal dependence on  in a more systematic way than fitting individual groups",
    ", we simultaneously fit all our galaxies which match the group criteria with @xmath46,\\ ] ] where we fit for values of @xmath47 for each of j=1,n groups and a single value for @xmath48",
    ". the quantity @xmath47 is the group mean value for  at a fiducial galaxy color of @xmath49 .",
    "the measurements of  and  carry errors which the pair - wise comparisons and the averaging procedure of section 2 indicate are accurate .",
    "we also anticipate that there will be an irreducable `` cosmic '' scatter in . accordingly ,",
    "in fitting  as a function of , we include an error allowance for this cosmic scatter which is nominally 0.05 magnitudes ( i.e. for this fit the error in  is enhanced by 0.05 magnitude in quadrature ) .",
    "in addition , we will also see scatter because the galaxies within groups are not truly at the same distance .",
    "we therefore calculate the rms angular position of the galaxies making up each group , and divide this radius by @xmath32 as an estimate of the rms group depth . converting this to a magnitude , we add it in quadrature to the error in .",
    "we then perform a linear fit of @xmath50 parameters which allows for errors in both the ordinate and abcissa , according to the `` least distance '' method used by tonry and davis ( 1981 ) .",
    "( this also appears in a slightly different guise in the second edition of _ numerical recipes _ by press et al .",
    "1992 )    we remove the three virgo galaxies which we believe are at significantly different distances from the rest of the group ( ngc  4365 , ngc  4660 , and ngc  4600 ) , mindful that what is considered to be part of virgo and what is not is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we also choose to exclude ngc  205 and ngc  5253 from the fit because recent starbursts make them extremely blue  we do not believe our modeling extends to such young populations .    with 149 galaxies we have 117 degrees of freedom , and we find that @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and the slope of the relation is @xmath53 .",
    "the galaxies contributing to the fit span a color range of @xmath54 .",
    "because virgo still contributes five of the seven most discrepant points ( the other two are in cetus ) , the rms depth used for virgo ( @xmath55  mag ) may be too small , making @xmath56 slightly bigger than one . if we replace the 3 virgo galaxies we omitted earlier , we find that @xmath56 rises to 1.75 for 120 degrees of freedom and the slope changes to @xmath57 , showing that even though these galaxies are significantly outside of virgo , the slope is robust . when we experiment with adding and removing different groups we find that the slope changes slightly , but is always consistent with the error above .",
    "these values for @xmath58 include an allowance for cosmic scatter of 0.05 magnitude and the nominal , rms group depth .",
    "these two , ill - constrained sources of error can play off against each other : if we double the group depth error allowance , we get @xmath59 for zero cosmic scatter ; if we increase the cosmic scatter to 0.10 magnitude , we need to decrease the group depth to zero in order to make @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , even though we can not unambiguously determine how much cosmic scatter there is in the   relation , it appears to be @xmath600.05 mag .",
    "the referee pointed out that even if we make no allowance for group depth , the cosmic scatter of 0.10 mag makes sbf the most precise tertiary distance estimator by far , and wanted to know how sensitive this is to our estimates of observational error .",
    "there is not much latitude for the cosmic scatter to be larger than 0.10 mag .",
    "the distribution of measurement error in  and  ( which also enter @xmath58 ) starts at 0.06 mag , and has quartiles at 0.11 , 0.16 , and 0.20 mag .",
    "if we wanted to increase the cosmic scatter by @xmath32 to 0.14 mag , we would have to have overestimated the observational errors by 0.10 mag in quadrature , and apart from the fact that a quarter of the measurements would then have imaginary errors , our pairwise comparison of multiple observations from the previous section would not allow such a gross reduction in observational error .",
    "figure 4 illustrates how  depends on  when all the group data have been slid together by subtraction of the group mean at @xmath49 .",
    "note again that spiral galaxies , in this case four galaxies with both cepheid and sbf distances , show no offset relative to the other early - type galaxies making up the groups in which they appear , other than the usual trend with .",
    "the overall rms scatter , 0.18 mag , arising from all the effects discussed above , is a testament to the quality of sbf as a distance estimator .",
    "the local group galaxies ngc  205 , ngc  147 , and ngc  185 have also been plotted in figure 4 ( although they were not used in the fit ) , under the assumption that they are at the same distance as m31 and m32 .",
    "this may or may not be a valid assumption for ngc  147 and ngc  185 , but they agree reasonably well with the mean relation .",
    "in contrast to these two galaxies , which are blue because of extremely low metallicity , ngc  205 has undergone a recent burst of star formation and has a strong a star spectral signature . because our models do _ not _ extend to such young populations , the systematic deviation from the mean relation is not unexpected .",
    "the inset in figure 4 extends the color range to show that this deviation continues for two other galaxies where there has been recent star formation : ngc  5253 and ic  4182 .",
    "ngc  5253 is 0.5 mag fainter than one would expect using a naive extrapolation of the relation to its color of @xmath61 , and ic  4182 has an sbf magnitude which is 0.75 mag fainter than one would judge from its cepheid distance and its color of @xmath62 .",
    "qualitatively this makes sense because the very young stars change the overall color of the galaxy quite a bit but are not very luminous in the @xmath0 band compared to the stars at the top of the rgb which are the main contributors to the sbf .",
    "it may be that these very young populations can be understood well enough that one can safely predict the sbf absolute magnitude from the mean color , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "tammann ( 1992 ) expressed concern that there are residual stellar population effects in sbf even after the correction for  color .",
    "however , his critique was based on an early attempt to correlate  as a function of  ( tonry et al . 1990 ) . unfortunately , that work had the wrong sign for the slope ( appropriate for the @xmath63 bandpasses but not @xmath0 ) , because it was based on the revised yale isochrones ( green et al .",
    "1987 ) , which did not properly model the line blanketing in metal rich , high luminosity stars .",
    "the effect noted by tammann was a residual correlation of the corrected  with the mg@xmath64 index among galaxies within a cluster .",
    "figure 5 shows these trends do not exist for the present data and the new ",
    "relation : in both fornax and virgo there is no residual correlation with either mg@xmath64 or galaxy magnitude .",
    "we conclude that a one - parameter , linear relation between  and  suffices to describe our data for @xmath65 ; the slope of the ",
    "relation is universally @xmath53 , and we are indeed detecting cosmic scatter in  of order 0.05 mag .",
    "very few galaxies fail to follow the relation , and for every such galaxy at least one of the following statements is true : ( 1 ) the measurement of  or  is doubtful ; ( 2 ) the galaxy may not be a member of the group we assigned it to ; ( 3 ) the stellar population is bluer than @xmath66 due to recent star formation .",
    "note that this slope is steeper than the value of 3 tendered by tonry ( 1991 ) and used by ciardullo et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who suggested that it might be as steep as 4 .",
    "basically , the reason for this is that the older data were noiser and were fitted only to errors in the ordinate , whereas in fact the errors in  are quite significant , particularly for the better measured , which count heavily in any weighted fit .",
    "we have effectively tested the hypothesis that the zero point of sbf is universal within groups , but in order to extend the test from group to group we need independent distance estimates . since the groups are all nearby , the group s redshift is not an accurate distance estimate  there are likely to be substantial non - hubble velocities included in the group s recession velocity .",
    "we therefore turn to other distance estimators : cepheids , planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) , tully - fisher ( tf ) , , type ii supernovae ( snii ) and type i supernovae ( snia ) . some of these estimators have zero points in terms of mpc ( such as cepheids and snii )",
    ", others have zero points in terms of km / s based on the hubble flow ( such as ) , and a few have both ( such as tf ) . for our initial discussion",
    "we seek only to establish whether the relative distances agree with sbf ; for now we do not care about the zero point , though it will soon be addressed .",
    "figures 6 and 7 show the comparison between the values of the sbf parameters  derived previously for each of our groups and the distances to the groups according to these 6 methods .",
    "the results of fitting lines of unity slope ( allowing for errors in both coordinates ) to the data in each panel are given in table 4 .",
    "we use the published error estimates for all of these other indicators so @xmath56 should be viewed with some caution : outliers and non - gaussian errors or over - optimistic error estimates can inflate @xmath56 even though the mean offset is still valuable . since each comparison is very important ,",
    "we briefly discuss them individually .",
    "there is now a growing number of cepheid distances with which we compare , but we are faced with the complication that cepheids occur in young stellar populations , while sbf is best measured where such populations are not present .",
    "there are five galaxies which have both cepheid and sbf distances : ngc  224 ( freedman & madore 1990 ) , ngc  3031 ( freedman et al 1994 ) , ngc  3368 ( tanvir et al .",
    "1995 ) , ngc  5253 ( saha et al .",
    "1995 ) , and ngc  7331 ( hughes 1996 ) .",
    "ngc  5253 is especially problematic for sbf , because its recent starburst has produced a much younger and bluer stellar population than we have calibrated .",
    "we can , of course , also compare distances according to group membership .",
    "there are 7 groups where this is currently possible : local group , m81 , cena , ngc  1023 ( ngc  925 from silbermann et al .",
    "1996 ) , ngc  3379 ( also including ngc  3351 from graham et al . 1996 ) , ngc  7331 , and virgo ( including ngc  4321 from ferrarese et al .",
    "1996 , ngc  4536 from saha et al .",
    "1996a , and ngc  4496a from saha et al . 1996b",
    "; we exclude ngc  4639 from sandage et al .",
    "1996 because we are also excluding ngc  4365 and the w cloud from the sbf mean ) . in the former case",
    "we find that fitting a line to  as a function of  yields a mean offset of @xmath67 mag with @xmath56 of 3.4 for 4 degrees of freedom , and @xmath68 mag with @xmath56 of 0.3 for 3 degrees of freedom when ngc  5253 is excluded . in the latter case we get a mean offset of @xmath69 mag with @xmath56 of 0.6 for 6 degrees of freedom .",
    "when ngc  5253 is excluded , the rms scatter is remarkably small , only 0.12 magnitudes for the galaxy comparison and 0.16 magnitudes for the group comparison .",
    "ciardullo et al .",
    "( 1993 ) reported virtually perfect agreement between sbf and pnlf , but recent publications ( jacoby et al .",
    "1996 ) have raised some discrepancies .",
    "examination of figure 7 reveals that our fit has two outliers : coma  i ( e.g. ngc  4278 ) and coma  ii ( e.g. ngc  4494 ) .",
    "because we do not know how to resolve this issue at present , table 4 gives the result for @xmath70 for the entire sample and when these two outliers are removed .",
    "since pnlf is fundamentally calibrated on cepheids , this is not independent of the previous number , but it does confirm that pnlf and sbf are measuring the same relative distances .",
    "the expanding photospheres method ( epm ) described most recently by eastman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) offers distance estimates which are largely independent of the cepheid distance scale .",
    "there is only one galaxy with both an epm and an sbf distance ( ngc  7331 ) , but there have also been two snii in dorado ( ngc  1559 and ngc  2082 ) , two in virgo ( ngc  4321 and ngc  4579 ) , and one in the ngc  1023 group ( ngc  1058 ) .",
    "the agreement between epm and sbf ( fig .",
    "6 ) is good .",
    "the farthest outlier is ngc  7331 , for which sbf and cepheid distances are discordant with the snii distance .",
    "table 4 lists separately the zero point , scatter , and @xmath56 when ngc  7331 is included and excluded .      b. tully ( 1996 ) was kind enough to provide us with tf distances to the sbf groups in advance of publication .",
    "the fit between tf and sbf gives @xmath71 mag .",
    "this is again not independent of the cepheid number , since the tf zero point comes from the same cepheid distances .",
    "figure 7 demonstrates that the agreement is generally good , despite the high @xmath56 which comes from a few non - gaussian outliers .",
    "we can not tell whether these outliers reflect non - gaussian errors in the methods or simply the difficulties of choosing spirals and early type galaxies in the same groups .",
    "we applied the sbf group criteria to the `` mark ii '' catalog of galaxy distances distributed by d. burstein .",
    "we selected all galaxies with `` good '' tf distances ( mostly from aaronson et al .",
    "1982 ) and computed an average distance to the groups , applying the usual malmquist bias correction according to the precepts of lynden - bell et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and the error estimates from burstein . because these distances have a zero point based on the distant hubble flow , we derive an average offset of @xmath72 mag .    [ [ section ] ]    most of the sbf groups are the same as those defined by faber et al .",
    "we compare their malmquist bias corrected distances to these groups ( which are based on a zero point from the distant hubble flow ) with sbf and find the same result as jacoby et al .",
    "( 1992 ) : the distribution of errors has a larger tail than gaussian , but the error estimates accurately describe the central core of the distribution .",
    "@xmath56 is distinctly larger than 1 , but the difference histogram in figure 7 reveals that this is because of the tails of the distribution .",
    "the fit between  and sbf gives @xmath73 mag .",
    "extraordinary claims have been made recently about the quality of snia as distance estimators .",
    "some authors ( e.g. sandage and tammann 1993 ) claim that suitably selected ( `` branch normal '' ) snia are standard candles with a dispersion as little as 0.2 mag .",
    "others ( e.g. phillips 1993 ) believe that they see a correlation between snia luminosity and their rate of decline , parametrized by the amount of dimming 15 days after maximum , @xmath74 .",
    "still others ( e.g. riess et al . 1995 ) agree with phillips ( 1993 ) but believe that they can categorize snia better by using more information about the light curve shape than just this rate of decline . finally , there is the `` nebular snia method '' of ruiz - lapuente ( 1996 ) which tries to determine the mass of the exploding white dwarf by consideration of the emission lines from the expanding ejecta .",
    "we therefore choose to compare sbf distances with snia under two assumptions : that snia are standard candles , and that @xmath75 is a better indicator of distance . in both cases",
    "we restrict our fits to @xmath76 as suggested by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and use a distance error of 0.225 mag for each snia .",
    "snia have been carefully tied to a zero point according to the distant hubble flow ( one of the main advantages of snia ) by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , under both assumptions .",
    "there have also been vigorous attempts to tie the snia to the cepheid distance scale which we have chosen not to use because of the circularity with our direct comparison between sbf and cepheids .",
    "the results are both encouraging and discouraging .",
    "we find that there is indeed a good correlation between snia distance and sbf , with average values of @xmath77 mag and @xmath78 mag for the group comparison under the two assumptions .",
    "as illustrated in figure 6 , @xmath75 does correlate better with distance than @xmath79 , but as long as `` fast declining '' snia are left out there is scant difference between the zero point according to the two methods .",
    "the panels of figure 6 showing sbf and snia hint at a systematic change between the nearest three and the farthest three groups , in the sense that there appears to be a change in zero point by about 0.7 mag .",
    "one might worry that this is evidence that sbf is `` bottoming out '' , but there is no hint of this in the comparisons with tf and  in figure 7 which extend to much fainter .",
    "one might also worry about whether there are systematic differences in snia in spirals and ellipticals , and biases from the lack of nearby ellipticals or s0 galaxies .",
    "however , it is probably premature to examine these points in too much detail .",
    "for example , the point at @xmath80 uses the sbf distance to leo  i , but the snia occurred in ngc  3627 which lies @xmath81 away from the leo  i group .",
    "this is a fundamental difficulty in the sbf  snia comparison , which will improve as sbf extends to greater distances and more nearby snia are observed .",
    "there are seven galaxies bearing snia where sbf distances have been measured : ngc  5253 ( sn  1972e ) , ngc  5128 ( sn  1986 g ) , ngc  4526 ( sn  1994d ) , ncg  2962 ( sn  1995d ) , ngc  1380 ( sn  1992a ) , ngc  4374 ( sn  1991bg ) , ngc  1316 ( sn  1980n ) .",
    "inasmuch as two of these are slow decliners ( sn  1986 g , sn  1991bg ) , we fit the remaining five using the sbf distance to the galaxy instead of the group .",
    "we derive @xmath82 mag and @xmath83 mag for the two methods .",
    "we regard the sbf distance to ngc  5253 as uncertain because we have not calibrated  for such a young stellar population .",
    "we thus also recompare sbf and snia with ngc  5253 removed from consideration .",
    "@xmath56 becomes dramatically smaller in both cases and @xmath84 become smaller by about 0.2 mag to @xmath85 mag and @xmath86 mag .",
    "these comparisons demonstrate that the second hypothesis is correct : the zero point of the ",
    "relationship is universal .",
    "we use the sbf  cepheid fit to derive a final , empirical relationship between  and : @xmath87.\\ ] ]    this zero point differs from that of tonry ( 1991 ) by about 0.35 magnitude .",
    "the reason is simply that the 1991 zero point was based entirely on m31 and m32 , and the observational error in both  and  worked in the same direction , as did the photometric zero point errors ( cf .",
    "table 1 for k0990 ) .",
    "the sbf distances which have been published therefore increase by about 15 percent ( for example fornax moves from 15  mpc to 17  mpc ) , except for virgo , where the earlier result included ngc  4365 which we now exclude in calculating the average distance to the core of the cluster .",
    "this new calibration is based on 10 cepheid distances in 7 groups and 44 sbf distances . as seen in figure 6 and table 4 ,",
    "these are highly consistent with one another with a scatter of about 0.15 mag .",
    "along with the extensive photometric recalibration , this zero point should be accurate to @xmath88 mag .",
    "this error estimate makes an allowance of 0.05 mag for the uncertainty in the cepheid zero point in addition to the statistical error of 0.05 mag , and the comparisons with theory and snii give us confidence that this truly is correct .",
    "finally we test our third hypothesis by comparing our relationship with theoretical models of stellar populations .",
    "figure 8 shows the model predictions of worthey ( 1993a , b ) along with the empirical line .",
    "when the theoretical models are fitted with the empirically determined slope of 4.5 , they yield a theoretical zero point of @xmath89 mag with an rms scatter of @xmath90 mag for the sbf relation .",
    "we enter this value in table 4 , with the scatter offered as an `` error estimate '' , but it must be remembered that this is fundamentally different from the other entries in the table . there is good agreement here , although the theoretical result for  may be slightly brighter ( 0.07 mag ) or slightly redder ( 0.015 mag ) than the empirical result .",
    "given the difficulties that the theoretical models have in simultaneously fitting the color and mg@xmath64 indices of real galaxies , we regard this agreement as excellent confirmation of the empirical calibration .",
    "the scope of this paper does not extend to comparing sbf distances with velocity ; this will be the subject of the next paper in the series .",
    "however , the comparison with other distance estimators does provide us with a measurement of the hubble constant .",
    "the comparison with other estimators whose zero point is defined in terms of mpc tells us the absolute magnitude of sbf . at our fiducial color of @xmath49",
    ", we find that cepheids give us an absolute magnitude @xmath91 .",
    "we prefer the group - based cepheid comparison because of the very few sbf measurements possible in spirals which have cepheids .",
    "the other mpc - based distance estimators are all consistent with this zero point , as we would hope since they are calibrated with the same cepheid data",
    ". the results from theoretical models of stellar populations and snii are also consistent with this zero point , and provide independent confirmation of the validity of the cepheid distance scale .",
    "the comparison of sbf with estimators whose zero point is based on the large scale hubble flow is less consistent .",
    "the estimators based on galaxy properties , tf and , are consistent with one another and consistent with sbf in terms of relative distances .",
    "they give a zero point for sbf at the fiducial color of @xmath49 of @xmath92 , where the error comes from the rms divided by @xmath93 .",
    "supernovae and sbf are more interesting .",
    "the group membership of the cepheid galaxies was not difficult since they were specifically chosen to be group members .",
    "in contrast , the snia are not easy to assign to groups in many cases . depending on ( 1 ) whether we fit galaxies individually or groups , ( 2 ) whether we use the `` standard candle '' model for snia or the `` light curve decline '' relation , and ( 3 ) whether we include or exclude ngc  5253 for which we regard our stellar population calibration as unknown , we get values for the sbf zero point as low as 13.64 and as high as 14.01 ( table 4 ) .",
    "averaging the two methods and again estimating uncertainties from rms divided by @xmath93 , we find @xmath94 for groups and @xmath95 for galaxies .",
    "because these differ from the tf and  by @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively , the discrepancy may not be statistically significant .",
    "it is possible that there are systematic errors in the tie to the distant hubble flow for tf and , whereas the snia appear to be wonderfully consistent with the large scale hubble flow . on the other hand",
    ", the nearby snia do not agree with sbf or cepheids as well as one might hope from the scatter against the hubble flow , which makes one worry about the systematics with sn1a . for example , the sn1a distances predicted for the fornax clusters are significantly larger than the very recent cepheid measurement of the distance to the fornax cluster ( silbermann et al .",
    "snii appear to agree pretty well with sbf and cepheids , and there should eventually be enough of them to tie very well to the large scale hubble flow . in subsequent papers we will present the direct tie between sbf and the hubble flow , both from ground - based observations as well as hst observations beyond 5000  km / s , but at present we depend on these other estimators to tie to the hubble flow .",
    "it is therefore with some trepidation that we offer a value for @xmath22 .",
    "we have a calibration for ; we have several calibrations for in terms of @xmath98 ; and of course @xmath99 .",
    "if we use the tf and calibration of sbf we get @xmath100  .",
    "examining groups and averaging the `` standard candle '' and the `` @xmath74 '' assumptions about snia gives us @xmath101  . if we compare galaxies directly without resorting to group membership , but leave out ngc  5253 , we get an average @xmath102  .",
    "we suspect that there is more to the snia story than is currently understood , so we therefore prefer not to use it to the exclusion of all other distance estimators .",
    "the range we find for @xmath22 is @xmath103 and our best guess at this point is derived by averaging the ties to the hubble flow from tf , , snia ( both methods ) in groups and snia ( both methods ) galaxy by galaxy .",
    "this weights the snia slightly more heavily than tf and  and gives a zero point of 13.72 which translates to @xmath104 the final error term includes a contribution of 0.07 magnitude from the disagreement between the cepheid and theory zero points ( which we hope is indicative of the true accuracy of our calibrations ) , and an allowance of 0.13 magnitude for the uncertainty in the tie to the distant hubble flow ( judged from the scatter among the various methods ) .    in order to facilitate comparisons with sbf distances",
    ", we offer the sbf distance to 12 nearby groups in table 5 .",
    "the relative distances are completely independent of any other distance estimator , and the zero point uses our cepheid - based calibration . as we finish our reductions and analysis , the remainder of the group and individual galaxy distances will be published .",
    "we have described the observational sample which comprises the sbf survey of galaxy distances .",
    "the survey was conducted over numerous observing runs spanning a period of nearly seven years .",
    "the photometry of the sample has been brought into internal consistency by applying small systematic corrections to the photometric zero points of the individual runs . based on comparisons between overlapping galaxy observations",
    ", we find that our error estimates for @xmath105 and @xmath106 are reliable , after correction for the photometry offsets .    from our measurements of  within galaxy groups ,",
    "we conclude that  is well described by a linear function of .",
    "comparison of our relative distances with cepheid distances to these groups indicates that this linear relationship is universal and yields the zero point calibration for the sbf method .",
    "this calibration is applicable to galaxies that are in the color range @xmath65 and which have not experienced recent bursts of star formation .",
    "any intrinsic , or `` cosmic , '' scatter about this relation is small , of order 0.05  mag . owing to many more data and",
    "improved photometry , this new calibration differs in its zero point by 0.35 mag from the earlier one of tonry ( 1991 ) , but is much closer to worthey s ( 1993 ) theoretical zero point , differing by just 0.07  mag .",
    "we take this close agreement to be an independent confirmation of the cepheid distance scale .",
    "an extensive set of comparisons between our sbf distances and those estimated using other methods provides still further evidence for the universality of the   relation .",
    "we find that the various methods are all generally quite reliable , apart from occasional outliers which serve to inflate the @xmath58 values for the comparisons . coupled with our distance zero point , our comparisons with methods tied to the distant hubble flow yield values of @xmath22 in the range 7286 km / s / mpc .",
    "the comparison with snia suggests values between 72 and 80 , and  and tf call for values around 86 .",
    "thus , the controversy over @xmath22 continues , but the famous `` factor of two '' is now a factor of 20 percent .",
    "although the sbf survey is still a work in progress , it is near enough to completion that the calibration presented in this paper should not change in any significant way .",
    "future papers in this series will use the sbf survey distances to address such issues as the velocity field of the local supercluster and a direct determination of @xmath22 , bulk flows , the great attractor , and the specific details of our sbf analysis method , including comprehensive listings of our  and distance measurements for individual galaxies .",

    "<S> we describe a program of surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) measurements for determining galaxy distances . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents the photometric calibration of our sample and of sbf in general . </S>",
    "<S> basing our zero point on observations of cepheid variable stars we find that the absolute sbf magnitude in the kron - cousins @xmath0 band correlates well with the mean  color of a galaxy according to @xmath1\\ ] ] for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees well with theoretical estimates from stellar population models .    </S>",
    "<S> comparisons between sbf distances and a variety of other estimators , including cepheid variable stars , the planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) , tully - fisher ( tf ) , , snii , and snia , demonstrate that the calibration of sbf is universally valid and that sbf error estimates are accurate . </S>",
    "<S> the zero point given by cepheids , pnlf , tf ( both calibrated using cepheids ) , and snii is in units of mpc ; the zero point given by tf ( referenced to a distant frame ) , , and snia is in terms of a hubble expansion velocity expressed in km / s . </S>",
    "<S> tying together these two zero points yields a hubble constant of @xmath3 as part of this analysis , we present sbf distances to 12 nearby groups of galaxies where cepheids , snii , and snia have been observed . </S>"
