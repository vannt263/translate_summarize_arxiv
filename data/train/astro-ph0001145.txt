    "the baikal neutrino telescope is deployed in lake baikal , siberia , from shore at a depth of .",
    "_ nt-200 _ , the medium - term goal of the collaboration @xcite , was put into operation at april 6th , 1998 and consists of 192 optical modules ( oms )  see fig.1 .",
    "an umbrella - like frame carries 8 strings , each with 24 pairwise arranged oms .",
    "three underwater electrical cables connect the detector with the shore station .    in april 1993 , the first part of _ nt-200 _ , the detector _",
    "nt-36 _ with 36 oms at 3 strings , was put into operation and took data up to march 1995 . a 72-om array , _ _ , run in . in 1996",
    "it was replaced by the four - string array _",
    "nt-96_. _ nt-144 _ , a six - string array with 144 oms , was taking data in .",
    "summed over 1140 days effective lifetime , @xmath0 muon events have been collected with .",
    "the oms are grouped in pairs along the strings .",
    "they contain 37-cm diameter _",
    "pms which have been developed specially for our project @xcite .",
    "the two pms of a pair are switched in coincidence in order to suppress background from bioluminescence and pm noise .",
    "a pair defines a _",
    "channel_.    [ fig1 ]    a _ muon - trigger _ is formed by the requirement of ( with _ hit _ referring to a channel ) within .",
    "@xmath1 is typically set to for such events , amplitude and time of all fired channels are digitized and sent to shore .",
    "a separate _ monopole trigger _ system searches for clusters of sequential hits in individual channels which are characteristic for the passage of slowly moving , bright objects like gut monopoles .",
    "the main challenge of large underwater neutrino telescopes is the identification of extraterrestrial neutrinos of high energy . in this paper we present",
    "results of a search for neutrinos with @xmath2tev obtained with the deep underwater neutrino telescope _ nt-96 _ at lake baikal @xcite .",
    "the used search strategy for high energy neutrinos relies on the detection of the cherenkov light emitted by the electro - magnetic and ( or ) hadronic particle cascades and high energy muons produced at the neutrino interaction vertex in a large volume around the neutrino telescope .",
    "we select events with high multiplicity of hit channels corresponding to bright cascades .",
    "the volume considered for generation of cascades is essentially _ below _ the geometrical volume of _ nt-96 . _",
    "a cut is applied which accepts only time patterns corresponding to upward traveling light signals ( see below ) .",
    "the shape of the neutrino spectrum was assumed to behave like @xmath23 as typically expected for fermi acceleration . in this case ,",
    "90% of expected events would be produced by neutrinos from the energy range @xmath24gev . comparing the calculated rates with the upper limit to the actual number of events , 2.3 for 90% cl we obtain the following upper limit to the diffuse neutrino flux :",
    "fig.2 shows the upper limits to the diffuse high energy neutrino fluxes obtained by baikal ( this work ) , sps - dumand @xcite , amanda @xcite , eas - top @xcite and frejus @xcite ( triangle ) experiments as well as model independent upper limit obtained by v.berezinsky @xcite ( curve labelled b ) ( with the energy density of the diffuse x- and gamma - radiation @xmath26 ev @xmath27 as follows from egret data @xcite ) and the atmospheric neutrino fluxes @xcite from horizontal and vertical directions ( upper and lower curves , respectively ) . also , predictions from stecker and salamon model @xcite ( curve labelled ss ) and protheroe model @xcite ( curve labelled p ) for diffuse neutrino fluxes from quasar cores and blazar jets are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the limit ( 6 ) obtained for the diffuse neutrino flux is of the same order as the limit announced by frejus @xcite but extends to much higher energies .",
    "we expect that analysis of 3 years data taking with _ nt-200 _ would allow us to lower this limit by another order of magnitude .",
