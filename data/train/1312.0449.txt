    "the top surface of the disk is made rough by gluing glass particles with diameter of 2  mm to it .",
    "the container is filled with particles ( black soda - lime glass beads , sigmund lindner 4504 - 007-l ) , a polydisperse mixture with a diameter between 1 and 1.3  mm , and a bulk density @xmath6 of 1.7@xmath7  kg / m@xmath8 , up to a filling height @xmath0 . to ensure good reproducibility",

    "all experiments are carried out under ambient temperature , pressure and relative humidity .",
    "we have verified that our experiments are insensitive to relative humidities ranging from 6 and 55% .",
    "after several months of use , the black coating of the particles visibly deteriorates , and the rheological behavior becomes more sensitive to humidity .",
    "we therefore renew our particles on a trimonthly basis , and found that our experiments reproduce well over the course of several years .    in the absence of vibrations ,",
    "the phenomenology of the flow is determined by the dimensionless filling height @xmath9 @xcite . in our experiments",
    ", we stay in the low filling height regime ( @xmath10 ) , where the shear bands are mainly vertical , and all grains above the disk co - rotate along with it ( trumpet - flow ) .",
    "we have found that in all but one flow regimes , the flow profiles observed at the free surface are insensitive to the magnitude of vibrations . for the exception  which is for slow flow and strong vibrations ",

    "our experiments focus on the rheological curves which relate the driving torque @xmath2 and the driving rate @xmath3 . in section [ sec : constantt ] we describe some experiments performed at constant torque , but our main focus is on experiments where we fix the driving rate in the range from 1 to 10@xmath14  rps , and probe the torque .",
    "we perform these experiments for a range of vibration amplitudes @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and moreover use seven different filling heights ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) . varying @xmath21 allows us to probe the role of the confining pressure for the rheology .",
    "each experiments starts with switching on the vibrations , after which we allow the shaker feedback loop 30  s to settle to the required value of @xmath1 .",
    "we proceed by applying an amount of pre - shear to the granular material , in order to obtain similar starting conditions for each experiment . unless noted otherwise , the protocol consists of the following steps : _",
    "( i ) _ 2  s of 1  rps rotation clockwise ; _ ( ii ) _ 4  s of 1  rps rotation counter - clockwise ; _ ( iii ) _ 2  s of 1  rps rotation clockwise .",
    "_ ( iv ) _ 5  s without imposed stress or shear . _",
    "( v ) _ start of actual measurement .",
    "the rotation in the experiments is in the clockwise direction to minimize anisotropy effects @xcite .",
    "vibrations lead to compaction of granular media , although this process is very slow for @xmath22 @xcite , whereas flow typically leads to dilatation @xcite .",
    "additionally , anisotropy in the fabric of the granular media needs a finite amount of strain to build up , but may be relaxed by vibrations @xcite . for both density and anisotropy ,",
    "vibrations and flow are in competition , and as we are interested in steady state flow properties , we need to ask : what is the minimum time or strain necessary to get into a steady state flow regime ?    we have probed the relaxation of our flows to a steady state by starting the flow from a denser or less densely packed state as follows : before each experiment , we perform pre - shear as described above .",
    "after pre - shear , during stage _",
    "( iv ) _ , we stop the shear and vibrate the material for a waiting period @xmath16 , during which the granular packing density increases by compaction , and then start the actual measurements . by varying the @xmath16 , we thus manipulate the packing fraction at the start of the flow . by measuring the torque as function of time",
    "we capture the evolution of the torque to its steady state value .",
    "as we expect this equilibration to be slowest for small @xmath3 we perform this test at the smallest @xmath3 ( 10@xmath14  rps ) that we explore in our experiments .    .",

    "[ fig : waiting ] , where we plot @xmath2 as function of the total angle of rotation of the bottom disk @xmath25 .",
    "this figure shows that for small @xmath16 , @xmath2 grows monotonically before reaching steady state , whereas for large @xmath16 , the torque peaks at values larger than the steady state value .",
    "this is consistent with a simple picture where the longer the waiting time , the denser the grains are packed at the start of the experiment , and the larger the torque needed to cause flow .    for all waiting times ,",
    "the torque reaches its steady state value for @xmath26  rad , corresponding to a measurement time of 150  s at 10@xmath14  rps .",
    "we claim that this represents the longest equilibration time necessary to reach a steady state flow situation , as all our experiments are carried out for @xmath27  rps .",
    "moreover , in many experiments our data is acquired in a so called strain rate sweep , where the rotation rate is varied by a small amount so that equilibration will be faster . in all cases , an equilibration strain or time of @xmath28  rad , or 150  s , will be sufficient to obtain steady state flow curves .",

    "the role of the flow rate is not as simple , with the torque often being a non monotonic function of the disk rate @xmath3  moreover , the details of the rheological curves depend on both the vibration strength @xmath1 and filling height @xmath21 .",
    "we note here that the sign of @xmath40 has a crucial rheological implication : flows for which @xmath41 can also be accessed in experiments where the torque is fixed , whereas flows for which @xmath42 are _ unstable _ in torque controlled experiments .",
    "as we discussed in @xcite , this range of unstable flows leads to hysteretic switching between two different flow regimes when the torque is varied , and is deeply connected to the yielding behavior of granular media observed for @xmath36 .    here",
    "we focus on rate controlled experiments , and as a first step in characterizing these curves , we plot the boundaries between the regions where @xmath40 is positive and negative for three values of @xmath21 in fig .",

    ", we can distinguish three regimes .",
    "_ inertial flows  _ for @xmath43  rps , @xmath41 ; the flow curves show an increasing @xmath2 for increasing @xmath3 .",

    ".    _ unstable flows  _ for intermediate flow rates , @xmath39 has a negative slope for small @xmath1  for @xmath52 , this regime extends to arbitrarily small flow rates , although there the flow curves become essentially flat . despite the unstable character of the global rheology , and in contrast to unstable flows in e.g. micelles @xcite",

    "the stress with flow rate is not very large , this regime can also be referred to as _",
    "quasistatic_.    _ vibration dominated flows  _ both the unstable / quasistatic and inertial regime have been studied in great detail already  @xcite , as they also arise in the absence of vibrations .",
    "hence , in the remainder of the paper we will focus on the new vibration dominated regime of slow , stable flows that arises for @xmath53 and @xmath54  rps .",

    "we suggest that at sufficiently low @xmath3 , compaction effects become significant , leading to an increase of @xmath2 with time , and a  kink  in the flow curves .",
    "we will now turn our attention to the increase of @xmath2 with @xmath21 , which allows us to probe the underlying mechanisms that govern the rheology of vibration dominated flows .",
    "the canonical starting point of descriptions of _ non - vibrated _ slow granular flows is that the shear stresses @xmath57 are proportional to the pressure @xmath47 @xcite , and the ratio of @xmath57 and @xmath47 is an effective friction coefficient , @xmath58 . for inertial flows ,",
    "a description where @xmath58 becomes rate dependent ( through the inertial number ) has been shown to capture much of the phenomenology @xcite , and for slow , non - vibrated flows , this mohr - coulomb picture combined with a non - local rheology captures the essentials of steady , slow granular flow @xcite .    by varying the filling height @xmath21",

    "clear predictions for @xmath59 exist from a well - studied rheological model for the driving torques in a split - bottom geometry @xcite .",

    "et al . _ , which was developed to describe the 3d shape of the shear zones in the split - bottom geometry , but which also makes a precise prediction for the driving torque as function of filling height for purely frictional flows @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the following three ingredients .",
    "first , think of the shear zones as localized along a narrow sheet @xmath69 ( corresponding to the center of the shear zones @xcite ) .",
    "second , assume that the stress tensor is colinear with the strain rate tensor @xcite and proportional to the hydrostatic pressure .",

    "minimizing @xmath66 for a given @xmath21 determines the shear sheet @xmath69 , from which the torque can be determined as function of @xmath21 .",
    "as expected , we can write this torque as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a universal function of @xmath21 . note that for shallow filling heights , the torque is approximately proportional to the product of pressure and the extension of the shear band , so that @xmath76 is quadratic in @xmath21 for @xmath77 .",
    "in contrast to the original split - bottom cell for which eq .",
    "( [ ttildeh ] ) was developed , in our system the driving disk is slightly elevated with respect to the bottom .",
    "this is done in order to avoid observing spurious torque fluctuations that we associate with the diverging strain rate in the original split - bottom setup .",
    "the elevated disk leads to a @xmath58 depended addition in the experimental torque signal @xmath2 , due to slip between the side of the disk and the stationary particles next to it .",
    "we have found that this drag term can be estimated as : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the disk thickness ( 5  mm ) , and @xmath58 is the effective friction coefficient for sliding of the disk past the particles , for which we use the same effective friction coefficient as for the granular flow .",

    "the peak in @xmath67 around @xmath96  rps is consistent with the onset of rate dependence below @xmath103 rps as per the following reasoning .",
    "first , both our raw data for @xmath2 as well as the best fits for @xmath58 show that rate dependence sets in rather abruptly for @xmath104  rps , and that rate dependence is strongest for large @xmath1 , consistent with the location and strength of the peak in @xmath67 .",
    "crucially , this onset of rate dependence sets in at different flow rates for different heights ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : overview_h ] ) , so that at a given @xmath3 , the data for @xmath59 mixes rate independent and rate dependent flows .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratedep]a we show examples of @xmath2 as function of height , that illustrate that when @xmath3 enters this rate dependent regime , @xmath59 strongly deviates from the quadratic form predicted by eq .",

    "it is important to realize that at a given @xmath3 , the local strain rate @xmath105 spans a wide range of values and has a strong @xmath102 dependence @xcite  see fig .",
    "[ fig : ratedep]b . hence , as the torque @xmath2 is an integral over the local stress in different layers in the material , @xmath39 mixes different local rheologies . more precisely",

    "we compute the location of the shear band at the free surface as a function of model parameter @xmath126 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ungershift]b .",
    "we find that for larger @xmath126 , the location of the shear band at the free surface moves inwards .",
    "thus , the closer the model resembles a newtonian rheology , the more the shear band moves towards the center .",
    "this can be understood intuitively as follows : the penalty for having a shear band at large radius at the surface is zero in the pressure dependent model , because the shear stress goes to zero at the free surface .",
    "once a finite amount of shear stress is present in the shear band at the surface , torque minimization will move the shear band inwards precisely as we observe in the experiments at @xmath127  rps , @xmath128 .",
    "conversely , for a frictional , rate dependent rheology , the shear stress closer to the surface is _ lower _ than that of a simple frictional model .",
    "we model this with a @xmath129 that can be captured with @xmath130 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ungershift]c . the torque penalty for having a shear band at finite @xmath131",
    "is thus reduced , and the model predicts indeed an _ increase _ of the shear band radius at the free surface ( fig .  [",

    "in this section we discuss stress controlled experiments .",
    "these experiments consist of the following protocol : after pre - shearing the sample , a fixed value of the driving torque @xmath2 is set , and the ensuing rotation angle @xmath25 of the disk is monitored .",
    "we show several examples of the time evolution of @xmath25 and its derivative @xmath3 for a range of values of the torque @xmath2 and vibration strength @xmath1 and fixed @xmath135 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmerge ] . data for other values of @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath21 look similar ; the small initial oscillatory motion , visible for small @xmath1 , is due to transient flexure oscillations .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmerge ] , in most cases the disk rotation rate reaches a steady state value after some equilibration time . for small @xmath2 ,",
    "this equilibration time becomes extremely long , much longer than in the rate controlled experiments shown above .",
    "this is typical for complex fluids that exhibit a so - called viscosity bifurcation @xcite , and we suggest that weakly vibrated granular media fall into this category .",
    "we also note that for small @xmath2 , the angle as function of time ( or alternatively , @xmath136 ) exhibits power law behavior reminiscent of andrade creep @xcite , again a typical feature of weakly driven disordered media .    for the data sets where @xmath3 reaches a steady state , we find that @xmath137 and @xmath39 are consistent  in other words , the steady state flow properties are the same as measured through the rheology under constant rate or constant stress driving .",
    "consistent with this picture , we observe that the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmerge ] illustrates that the steady state values of @xmath3 exhibit a jump between inertial rates ( @xmath138  rps ) and significantly slower flow rate ( @xmath54  rps ) , consistent with the hysteretic transition between inertial and vibration dominated flows observed in @xcite .    . in ( a )",
    ", we show the @xmath25 as a function of time , in ( b ) , we show the derivative of @xmath25 : @xmath3 . it can be seen that the curves for low @xmath1 and @xmath57 show very long transients .",

    "to summarize , we probe the rheology of weakly vibrated granular media and find several different flow regimes .",
    "first , for @xmath93  rps , our data shows the well known _ inertial flow _ regime , consistent with a rough estimate of the inertial number . in the absence of vibrations ,",
    "lower flow rates lead to an essentially rate independent , _ quasistatic _ ,",
    "regime , where the variation of the torque is small , and where @xmath59 is well fitted using eq .",
    "( [ ungereq ] ) , implying that the shear stresses are proportional to the pressure here . for @xmath36 ,",
    "this regime covers all @xmath140  rps , whereas the range of flow rates where this rate independent regime resides shrinks in the presence of vibrations , and almost vanishes for @xmath109 . for @xmath3 below the rate independent regime and @xmath38 ,",
    "we have described three _ vibration dominated _ regimes . for two of these regimes ,",
    "our data shows that the shear stresses are still proportional to the normal stresses , but now via rate dependent @xmath61 . for the slowest of these two regimes ,",
    "we see a slow densification , leading to a kink in the flow curves .",
    "finally , for @xmath1 close to one , the vibrations affect the rheology of the granular medium so significantly , that the shear stresses are no longer proportional to the normal stresses , signifying a complete departure of the frictional nature that is a hallmark of all other types of slow granular flows .",
    "we appreciate helpful discussions with o. dauchot and h. jaeger , j. mesman for outstanding support in constructing the setup , and t. tampung for support in developing the electronics .",
    "we thank l. van dellen for his contribution to the experiments and data analysis . this work was supported by the dutch physics foundation fom .",
    "our setup allows to do sensitive rheology on vibrated materials and its main parts are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . the granular split - bottom flow cell forms the heart of setup , and consists of a cylindrical flow cell , the bottom of which is formed by a rotating disk that drives the flow .",
    "the disk is attached to an axle which is mounted in a cylindrical air bearing ( @xmath141 1/4 \" , new way ) : rotational motion is friction - free which allows precise rheological measurements .    in ordinary split - bottom cells ,",
    "the strain rate diverges at the split .",
    "we have found that the torques occasionally show strong fluctuations in this case , presumable due to individual particle being trapped just above the split  moreover , these fluctuations depend on the precise roughness near the split , thus leading to a dependence of the average @xmath2 on such experimental details . to avoid this ,",
    "we make sure that the strain rate field is smooth at the grain level and have elevated the driving disk by 6  mm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diskfric ] ) .",
    "the side of the disk is smooth , and particles immediately next to the disk hardly move , creating a static bottom layer flush with the disk .",
    "hence , the boundary conditions are essentially the same as for the ordinary split - bottom disk , and the elevation does not affect the overall flow field for @xmath9 larger than about 0.1 .",
    "the elevation does ensue that the torques are insensitive to experimental details and do not show the aforementioned spurious fluctuations .",
    "we induce vibrations in the split - bottom cell with an electromagnetic shaker ( vts systems vg100 ) , driven by a function generator ( thurlby thandar tg1010 ) via a commercial audio amplifier ( crown ce1000 ) .",
    "the shaker is coupled to the flow cell via a long rod , and the cell is mounted on a square air bearing ( 4``x4 '' , new way ) , which ensures that the slider and flow cell move virtually friction free in the vertical direction , with the amplitude of the residual horizontal vibrations in the submicron range due to the stiffness of the air bearing .",
    "the total combined weight of the slider and the split - bottom cell is approximately 12  kg and too large to be carried by the shaker alone .",
    "therefore we support their weight with four suspension springs with a stiffness of 2  kn / m , connected to the aluminum frame shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]a , b .",
    "the vertical acceleration of the split - bottom cell is measured by a combination of two accelerometers ( dytran e3120ak and a modified adxl322eb  ) . to limit the mechanical coupling between the table and the shaker , the shaker is placed on a stack of concrete tiles with rubber mats sandwiched between them .",
    "we do not observe any appreciable heaping  @xcite .",
    "the vibrations in the flow cell should not induce relative vertical motion between the disk that drives the granular flow and the container . to ensure that the disk only induces rotational shear deformations and no additional vibrations",
    ", we attach a flange to the disks axle .",
    "the surface of the flange is polished , and clamped between four flat air bearings ( @xmath141 25  mm , new way ) ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : cusairbearing ] . by mounting the flat air - bearing assembly on the container ,",
    "we ensure that disk and container move together during the vibration cycle : the stiffness of one flat bearing , for a typical gap between the bearing and the flange of 5  @xmath58 m , is 18  n/@xmath58 m . since the peak acceleration of the system is never larger than @xmath142  @xmath71 , and the weight of the flange / axle / disk construction is less than a kilogram , the maximum residual motion between the disk and the container is smaller than a micrometer , which is the typical length scale of asperities on glass beads  @xcite .",
    "a rheometer ( anton paar dsr 301 ) , coupled to the flow cell via a system of flexures and airbearings , allows to probe and control the granular flow .",
    "as the rheometer can not be vibrated , and its rotational axis is housed in a very stiff air - bearing , we need to decouple the vibrations from the rheometer , and also compensate for inevitable misalignments of rheometer and flow cell .",
    "we therefore couple the two axes with a flexure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]c .",
    "this flexure has a torsional spring constant of 4  nm / rad and compressional spring constant of 5  @xmath143  n / m .",
    "the flexure can be compressed easily and therefore accommodate the vertical motion of the disk axle .",
    "the copper blades used in the flexure are flexible enough to compensate for any small misalignment between the axis of the disk and the rheometer , without exerting significant forces on the bearings .",
    "our dsr 301 rheometer is a stress driven rheometer , so its native mode is to set a torque to control rotation .",
    "it is also possible to use the rheometer in a so - called constant shear rate mode . in this mode",
    ", the rheometer applies a feedback routine that dynamically adjusts its torque in order to achieve a constant rotation rate .",
    "this process has one control parameter : the rate at which the torque is increased or decreased .",
    "this timescale is set by the desired driving rate , and by a user - defined time constant , and in principle could affect all constant shear rate experiments . in these experiments we set the feedback constant such that we observe smooth rotation , which is achieved for a feedback parameter , the so called csr - value , of 25% .",
    "if the torque adaptation rate is too high and becomes of the order of the eigenfrequency of the rheometer axle , the feedback routine will be affected by the rotational eigenmodes of the mass - spring system of the rheometer axle .        to compensate for inevitable misalignments between the shaker axis and vertical air - bearing axis , we couple them via a 40  cm long and flexible aluminum rod .",
    "the aluminum rod is flexible enough to compensate for a horizontal alignment mismatch of a few millimeter , but stiff enough to ensure a mechanical coupling for vertical motion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]a ) .",
    "misalignment between the disk and rheometer axle causes rotationally periodic variations in the force that the rheometer exerts on the disk and grains .",
    "this periodic modulation of the torque can be reduced by improving the alignment of the flexure - coupled axles .",
    "we manually align the rheometer with the disk axis by setting a constant rotation rate to the disk , with no particles in the container . while the disk rotates ,",
    "we monitor the required torque to run the disk at the set speed .",
    "this torque has a periodic modulation ; alignment of the two axis with the set screws on the air bearing reduces the amplitude of this periodic modulation on the torque .",
    "a typical alignment run is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : residue ] : the modulations can be minimized to an amplitude of less than 20  @xmath58 nm , which is @xmath144 0.1% of the largest torque need to drive our granular flows .",
    "nota that a small torque offset also remains since the flat air bearings that confine the vertical motion of the flange can not be positioned perfectly parallel to the flange .",
    "this induces an asymmetry in the air flow between the bearings and the flange .",
    "this exerts a torque of the order of 20  @xmath58 nm on the flange ; a negligible amount in comparison to the typical driving torques employed in our experiments .            to choose an appropriate external vibration frequency",
    ", we measure how the steady state rotation rate @xmath3 under a constant applied torque @xmath146  mnm and fixed vibration amplitude @xmath147 depends on the vibration frequency @xmath12 .",
    "we carry out the measurements with a filling height of @xmath21 = 0.55 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vibrheo : mechresp ] .",
    "we see that there is a resonance above 105  hz , and for vibration frequencies between 50 and 75  hz , the rotation rate depends only marginally on the vibration frequency . we choose the middle of this regime , @xmath12 = 63  hz to carry out all experiments discussed in this paper .",
    "the vertical vibration amplitude at a peak acceleration of 1  @xmath71 at this frequency is 64  @xmath58 m .",
    "it is critical that the vibration amplitude is constant during the duration of the experiments , which can last for hours .",
    "the shaker generates considerable heat , which affects its operation ; with constant driving current to the shaker coils , the vibration amplitude slowly drifts over @xmath148 per hour .    to keep the vibration amplitude constant during the experiments , we employ a labview driven feedback scheme that continuously adjusts the driving current for the shaker coil .",
    "a function generator , under computer control , sends a sine wave to the amplifier that drives our shaker .",
    "accelerometers detect the actual shaking amplitude .",
    "we find that the harmonic distortion of the sinusoidal shaker motion is about 1% , so we use a lock - in amplifier ( srs 830 ) to achieve a high accuracy measurement of the vibration amplitude . the computer then adjust the output of the function generator , and with this feedback scheme we can maintain a stability of @xmath1 to within @xmath149  @xmath71 .",
    "we verify that a steady state flow rate can be obtained by the rheometer and that we observe no long term transients in the rate control mode .",
    "to do this , we measure the instantaneous driving torque and speed as a function of time for different rotation rates @xmath3 and vibration amplitudes @xmath1 .",
    "we apply pre - shear before the start of the experiment , and start a logarithmic ramp down in @xmath3 , from @xmath151 to @xmath152  rps with 2 steps per decade .",
    "we measure for all @xmath3 over a minimum strain of 0.5 rotation , or a total shear time of 10 seconds , whichever is longer .",
    "we sample the rotation rate and torque with a rate of 10  hz . the results for @xmath21 = 0.33 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transient ] , both the instantaneous speed of the disk and the driving torque as a function of time .",
    "note the logarithmic scale on the time axis .",
    "we see that for @xmath153 , the set speeds are achieved very accurately and no large fluctuations or transients are observable .",
    "the fluctuations in the torque signal are however appreciable .",
    "transients are short , even for the slowest run  for more on transients , see the next section . for @xmath150 ,",
    "the fluctuations in both speed and torque are strongly reduced and we can clearly see that no long time transients are present in these experiments . we conclude that the mean driving torque @xmath2 and mean rotation rate @xmath3 are well defined quantities in steady state shear experiments ."
