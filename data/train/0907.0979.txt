    "confined quantum  mechanical models have proved to be suitable first approximations for estimating the effect of pressure on the spectral lines of atoms and molecules or the effect of their neighbours in condense media .",
    "several such models have been proposed for pedagogical purposes in introductory courses on quantum mechanics@xcite . among them",
    "we mention the quantum bouncer@xcite , the harmonic oscillator@xcite and the hydrogen atom@xcite .",
    "such models have also been useful for the discussion of semiclassical approaches@xcite , the variational method@xcite and perturbation theory@xcite . regarding the latter approach we mention that the sum over states is impractical for the calculation of corrections of order greater than the first one@xcite .",
    "it is preferable either to integrate the perturbation equations directly@xcite or to make use of the hypervirial and hellmann ",
    "feynman theorems@xcite .    in the case of the harmonic oscillator",
    ", most studies refer to the case of a particle that moves in a box under the effect of a potential of the form @xmath0 as if it were tied to the point @xmath1 by means of a spring of force constant @xmath2@xcite . if we assume that the hooke s force is due to the interaction between two particles then we have a model similar to the one discussed by tanner@xcite who showed that it is not possible to separate the center of mass and internal degrees of freedom in the usual way because of the effect of the boundary conditions .",
    "amore and fernndez@xcite have recently discussed this problem in greater detail .",
    "the usual model for the confined hydrogen atom suffers from the same limitation : the nucleus is considered to be clamped somewhere inside the box@xcite .",
    "it appears to be most interesting to assume that not only the electron but also the nucleus moves inside it .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss such a model in the simplest possible ways . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we outline the model and write the schrdinger equation in a dimensionless form . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pt ] we obtain the ground",
    " state energy approximately by means of first ",
    "order perturbation theory and compare it with the one for the clamped  nucleus case . in sec .",
    "[ sec : variational ] we resort to a somewhat more elaborate variational function . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize and discuss the results .",
    "the hamiltonian operator for a nonrelativistic hydrogen  like atom is @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the masses of the electron and nucleus located at @xmath6 and @xmath7 with charges @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath13 denotes the laplacian in the coordinates indicated by the subscript .    in the case of the free atom we separate the motion of the center of mass from the internal one by means of a well  known change of variables and",
    "obtain @xmath14 where @xmath13 and @xmath15 are the laplacians for the variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , and @xmath18 is the reduced mass .",
    "thus , we can factor the energy states of the free hydrogen atom as @xmath19 and solve the schrdinger equation for @xmath20 in the usual way@xcite .",
    "the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of @xmath20 provide all the physical properties of the isolated atom , such as , for example , the spectral lines , selection rules , etc.@xcite .",
    "if the atom is confined to a spherical box of radius @xmath21 with impenetrable walls then the states should vanish when either @xmath22 or @xmath23 and , consequently , the above separation is not possible as discussed by tanner@xcite and amore and fernndez@xcite for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the reason is that the variables @xmath24 and @xmath16 are unsuitable for the boundary conditions that are naturally given in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the positions of the electron an nucleus in the box are completely determined by six variables .",
    "we conveniently choose @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( the sides of a triangle ) plus three angles for the orientation of the triangle in space .",
    "the @xmath28 states ( those with zero angular momentum ) depend only on the three radial variables : @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , if we take into account that @xmath30 then we realize that @xmath29 has zero angular momentum : @xmath31    in order to simplify the calculation we first make the change of variables @xmath32 and @xmath33 that leads to the dimensionless hamiltonian operator @xmath34 the states of this dimensionless system vanish when either @xmath35 or @xmath36 . from now on we omit the primes on the dimensionless quantities but keep in mind that lengths , masses and energies are measured in units of @xmath21 , @xmath4 , and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "for example , @xmath38 is the nuclear mass in such units .",
    "for simplicity we restrict ourselves to the ground state and a small box radius .",
    "if @xmath39 is a small parameter then we can try perturbation theory in terms of the unperturbed or reference hamiltonian @xmath40 .",
    "the perturbation is therefore given by the interaction between the particles @xmath41 . the unperturbed ground state is @xmath42 therefore , the expectation value of @xmath43 with this function gives us the energy of the ground state corrected through first order of perturbation theory .",
    "besides , according to the variation principle such approximate energy will be an upper bound to the exact one@xcite .",
    "the calculation is reminiscent of that for the helium atom under the clamped ",
    "nucleus approximation and we may therefore profit from well  known results .",
    "the calculation of the expectation value of the kinetic energy is straightforward , and there are various ways of calculating the expectation value of @xmath44@xcite . here",
    ", we resort to the expansion of @xmath44 in terms of legendre polynomials that leads to the simple integral@xcite @xmath45   \\label{eq:<1/r>}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the analytical expression is rather cumbersome we just show the numerical result : @xmath46    computer algebra systems are nowadays available in the science departments of most universities because they are invaluable teaching tools",
    ". this problem may be useful for motivating the students to resort to such software .",
    "we can obtain simple analytical expressions by means of the even simpler trial function @xmath47 that leads to a quite similar result @xmath48    it is interesting to compare the results for this model with those for the hydrogen atom with the nucleus clamped at the center of the box .",
    "if we calculate the expectation value of the dimensionless hamiltonian operator ( notice that we use the same units as before ) @xmath49 with the approximate trial function @xmath50 we obtain @xmath51 for comparison we also consider the unperturbed ground state @xmath52 that leads to the first ",
    "order dimensionless energy @xmath53 obviously , these results are valid for sufficiently small values of @xmath54 . after contrasting equations ( [ eq : eh(lam)_anal ] ) and ( [ eq : eh(lam)_pt ] ) with more accurate results@xcite",
    "we conclude that present first ",
    "order estimates are acceptable for @xmath55 . in principle",
    ", we may assume that the accuracy of present moving ",
    "nucleus results are as accurate as the clamped ",
    "nucleus ones for @xmath55 . if this is true , then our results suggest that the energy of the moving  nucleus model is larger than the clamped ",
    "nucleus one ( @xmath56 ) , at least for sufficiently small box radii .",
    "the difference does not come mainly from the kinetic energy of the nucleus that is proportional to @xmath57 but from the electron ",
    "nucleus interaction .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with earlier variational results that show that the smallest energy takes place when the nucleus is clamped at the center of the sphere and increases as it approaches the wall@xcite .",
    "[ fig : bh ] shows the approximate energies given by equations ( [ eq : e(lam)_pt ] ) , ( [ eq : e(lam)_anal ] ) , ( [ eq : eh(lam)_anal ] ) and ( [ eq : eh(lam)_pt ] ) for @xmath58 as well as accurate numerical energies for the clamped nucleus model calculated by a straightforward power  series method@xcite .    the critical value of @xmath39 defined by @xmath59 estimated from the first ",
    "order perturbation energy ( [ eq : eh(lam)_pt ] ) @xmath60 is about @xmath61 larger than the actual value @xmath62 that one easily obtains by means of the method already mentioned above or from perturbation theory of greater order@xcite . for the moving  nucleus model our approximate expressions ( [ eq : e(lam)_pt ] ) and ( [ eq : e(lam)_anal ] ) predict @xmath63 and we expect that its error is of comparable magnitude .",
    "we can improve the results of the preceding section by means of the variational method . to this end",
    "we propose the trial function @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a variational parameter and @xmath66 an appropriate normalization factor . since it has the correct asymptotic behaviour @xmath67 for the free atom , we expect it to yield accurate energies for large values of @xmath39 .",
    "more precisely , we expect that it yields the exact energy of the ground state of the free hydrogen @xmath68    by means of a straightforward but tedious calculation we prove that @xmath69    it follows from @xmath70 and @xmath71 that @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , we can calculate all the integrals that are necessary for the variational approach by means of the simple recipe@xcite @xmath73    the calculation of the variational energy is simple but tedious and yields rather cumbersome results . in what follows",
    "we simply outline the main steps .",
    "first , notice that @xmath74 is a linear function of @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , instead of calculating @xmath75 from the minimum condition @xmath76 we derive an analytical expression for @xmath77 and a parametric expression for the variational energy : @xmath78 .",
    "one can easily carry out this calculation by means of a computer algebra system .",
    "[ fig : bhv ] shows approximate values of @xmath79 obtained from the trial functions ( [ eq : phi_0_b ] ) and ( [ eq : phi_v ] ) .",
    "we appreciate that there is a satisfactory agreement for @xmath55 as expected but it seems that our earlier prediction of the critical value @xmath80 was not as accurate as we believed .",
    "the variational function ( [ eq : phi_v ] ) yields the more accurate value @xmath81 that differs @xmath82 from our earlier estimation .",
    "we also realize that the variational energy approaches the exact free  atom energy ( [ eq : lim_epsilon ] ) as @xmath39 increases .    in passing , we mention that the variational calculation confirms the earlier perturbation result that the energy of the moving  nucleus atom is larger than the one with the nucleus clamped at origin .",
    "tanner@xcite proposed a pedagogical discussion of the effect of the boundary conditions on the separability of the degrees of freedom of a confined system .",
    "however , he did not show any result for the one  dimensional harmonic oscillator that he chose as an illustrative example . later amore and fernndez@xcite discussed that model in more detail . in this article",
    "we extended those arguments to the hydrogen atom and carried out simple approximate calculations for the ground state by means of straightforward first ",
    "order perturbation theory and a more accurate variational approach .",
    "it has been our purpose to show how to do the calculation using well  known techniques already applied to the helium atom with the clamped  nucleus approximation .",
    "our analysis shows that it is not possible to separate the schrdinger equation in the usual way in terms of internal and center  of  mass coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath24 , respectively , because the boundary conditions are given in terms of the electron and nucleus coordinates @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "our approximate results show that the energy is greater when the nucleus moves than when it is clamped at the center of the spherical box and that the difference does not come mainly from the kinetic energy of the moving nucleus that is considerably smaller that the electronic one .",
    "present results based on perturbation theory are limited to a small box radius or strong confinement but the variational ones are valid for all box sizes and yield the free  atom energy when @xmath83 .",
    "although it is relatively easy to carry out perturbation calculations of large order for the clamped ",
    "nucleus model@xcite , the treatment of the moving  nucleus case is considerably more complicated .",
    "the variational method appears to be a better choice .",
    "it can be improved as in the case of the helium atom by means of a hylleraas  like expansion@xcite for the trial function @xmath84 ."
