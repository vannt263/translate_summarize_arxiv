    "the system of ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices has become a nice experimental platform to simulate the effects in condensate matter physics @xcite .",

    "the bloch oscillation ( bo ) is the oscillatory motion of a quantum particle in a periodic potential when it is subjected to an external force .",
    "it was originally predicted in solid - state system where the motions of the electrons in tilted periodic potentials undergo coherent oscillations @xcite .",
    "the formal resemblance between electrons in crystals and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices has inspired an extensive interest to explore the bos in optical lattice system .",
    "the successful observations of bos have been reported for atoms in interacting becs @xcite and for ensembles of noninteracting quantum - degenerate fermions @xcite in tilted optical lattices .",
    "however , the perfect bos can only be available in the ideal case where there is no interactions among the atoms of becs .",
    "practically , due to the intrinsically weak interactions of atoms , the momentum distribution of the becs will show a rapid broadening , which causes the atoms of becs to lose their phase coherence , i.e. the dephasing effect @xcite .",
    "consequently , the bos in becs can not persist on for a long time . in the framework of the mean - field treatment",
    ", the motion of the becs can be well described by the so - called gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) with a nonlinear term .",
    "it is believed that such nonlinearity induced by the atom - atom interactions generally leads to a breakdown of the bos , as recently studied experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "therefore , a natural question is : is it possible to prolong or even stabilize the bos by some active control ways ?    addressing this question , some progress , especially in single - component becs , has been made .",
    "it has been found that a long - living bo can be induced by properly designing the spatial dependence of the scattering length @xcite and the configuration of the optical lattices @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed the experimental evidence that the dephasing time of the bos can be much enhanced by decreasing the interaction strengths via the feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "however , in many situations , such finite enhancement to the dephasing time of bos is not enough , and one is desired to preserve the bos forever .",
    "recently , gaul _ et al .",
    "_ have reported that a persistent bo of single - component becs can be obtained by modulating interaction harmonically in time with suitable frequency and phase @xcite , which can be easily realized by means of feshbach resonance .",
    "so far , most of the studies of the stabilization control to bo of becs in optical lattice are based on the single - component bec case .",
    "compared with single - component bec , the two - component bec system may exhibit more novel physical effects due to the condensate mixtures @xcite . in this system ,",
    "both intracomponent and intercomponent atom - atom interactions take effects upon the nonlinear behavior of the becs .",
    "the two - component becs can be experimentally realized by spin - dependent optical lattices , which hold the becs with the two components composed of two distinct hyperfine states of the same atomic species @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study systematically the modulation stabilization of the bos of two - component becs in optical lattices .",
    "we mainly use two control ways , one is by modulating periodically the interactions via feshbach resonance ; the other is by tuning statically the parameters of the optical lattices .",
    "we will show that the stable bos can be obtained when the interactions are modulated synchronously and harmonically in time with suitable frequencies .",
    "moreover , if the intercomponent and the intracomponent interactions have inverse signs , the long - living bos and even the revival of the bos can be achieved via only tuning the the relative separation between lattices .",

    "the time - dependent interaction coefficients are given by @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the @xmath10-wave scattering length which can be controlled via the feshbach resonance induced by the modulated magnetic field .",
    "the external potential felt by the @xmath6-th component can be decomposed into @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a linear potential induced by a constant force @xmath13 and @xmath14 is trapping potential of the optical lattice .",

    "the damping of the bos is caused by the intracomponent interactions @xmath87 , which means that the nonlinearities inevitably lead to the breakdowns of the bos .",
    "in the situation of two - component becs , the intercomponent interaction @xmath88 will add another nonlinearity to each individual component of the becs , which gives an additional contribution to the damping rate , as shown in eq .",

    "from the above analytical results , we can see that the nonlinearities contributed from both of the intercomponent and intracomponent interactions generally lead to the breakdowns of the bos of the becs in the optical lattices .",
    "therefore , the interaction coefficients @xmath92 of such nonlinearities , which are essentially determined by the @xmath10-wave scattering lengths @xmath93 , have profound impact on the dynamics of two - component becs in the optical lattices .",
    "the magnitude and sign of these parameters sensitively influence dynamical behaviors of this ultracold boson system . in cold - atom experiments ,",
    "feshbach resonance is a quite effective mechanism that can be used to modulate @xmath92 .",
    "inspired by a recent experimental investigation of the ultracold molecule production via a sinusoidal magnetic field modulation to the interaction coefficient around the feshbach resonance @xcite , we intend to explore the possibility to stabilize the bos via such periodic modulations to the interaction coefficients @xmath92 in the following . besides the magnetic field induced feshbach resonance , another way to modulate the dynamics of the becs in our system is via adjusting the configuration of the optical lattices .",
    "the separation between the spin - dependent potentials felt by the two components of becs , which can be adjusted by the polarization angle @xmath20 of the lasers , essentially determines the intercomponent interactions of the becs .",

    "the combined effect of the feshbach resonance and a periodic external potential has been widely studied @xcite .      in this case , both of the intercomponent and intracomponent interactions are repulsive . without loss of generality , we assume that the intercomponent interactions @xmath88 relate to the intracomponent interactions @xmath87 as : @xmath95 in our numerical simulations .    to see the effect of nonlinearities on the bos , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the attenuations of bos without modulations . from the time - dependent behaviors of the wave - packet centers @xmath96 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) ] we can see clearly the breakdown of bos with time evolution .",
    "such damping oscillations are manifested by the behaviors of the effective damping rates @xmath97 [ fig . [ fig:1](c ) ] and the driven force @xmath98 [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](f ) ] , where @xmath97 are always positive and increase with time , and @xmath99 tend to constants after the same cycles as @xmath96 . compared with the case for the single - component becs @xcite , the presence of the intercomponent interactions , sharing the same sign with intracomponent ones here , play the role as an additional nonlinearities and speed up the collapses in our two - component situation .",
    "so , the stronger the intercomponent interactions are , the faster the bos damp .",
    "[ fig:1](d ) shows that @xmath100 , the associated momenta of @xmath96 , increase linearly with time .",
    "this can be understood from the analysis of eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) .",
    "the first term of the right hand of eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) , which is contributed from the intercomponent interactions , is much smaller than the second term , which is contributed from the linear potential .",

    "[ fig:1](b ) shows that the widths @xmath103 undergo breathing oscillations and soon approach constants .",
    "the associated momenta @xmath104 are also divergent , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](e ) .",
    "all these time - dependent behaviors indicate that the system is set into a macroscopical quantum self - trapping mode @xcite due to the nonlinearities from the intercomponent and intracomponent interactions .",
    "now we focus on how to stabilize the bos in our system .",
    "we mainly use the way by modulating periodically the interactions via a magnetic field .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we plot the time - dependent behaviors of the wave - packet variables under a @xmath105 , where @xmath86 is the frequency of bos , modulation to all the interactions .",
    "we can see that the damping of the bos can be fully stabilized by such modulation and perfect oscillations is thus obtained .",
    "such persistent phenomena can be also explained straightforwardly by studying the time - dependence of the damping coefficients @xmath106 [ fig . [ fig:2](c ) ] and the effective driven forces @xmath99 [ fig . [ fig:2](f ) ] .",
    "in contrast to the positivity in the full evolution range in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) , @xmath106 in this case exhibit periodic oscillations between positive and negative values with definite amplitudes , which characterizes well the lossless bos of @xmath107 .",
    "it means that the effective damping coefficients with alternate signs inspirit the system itself to guarantee the stabilizations of the bos . besides",
    ", we find that the driven forces in fig . [ fig:2](f ) are replaced by constant values completely after such modulation .",
    "it has been proven that there is a family of stable solutions in terms of collective coordinates in single - component bec system when all the interactions are modulated by cos(@xmath86 t ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , in two - component ones , the coupled terms in the eqs .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) can be regarded as additional nonlinearities , which possess the same time dependence as intracomponent interactions so long as modulating all interactions harmonically in time with the same suitable frequencies . as viewed from the mean field ,",
    "the two components can be reduced into two independent single ones .",
    "so it is understandable that such modulation stabilization also presents in our two - component becs system .",
    "it is noted that the effect of the modulation to the bos is sensitively dependent of the forms of modulating field we used . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , we plot the numerical simulation when all the interactions are modulated by a @xmath108 field .",
    "it is found that the damping of the bos manifested by @xmath107 is not suppressed and the bos is destroyed in several rounds of oscillation .",
    "the wave - packet widths @xmath76 reduce their amplitudes quickly .",
    "so the modulation takes no effect in this case .    in the present case ,",
    "the intercomponent interactions share the same sign as the intracomponent ones , so the tuning of the relative separation @xmath44 does not have constructive action to suppress the damping of bos .",
    "however , the things are changed dramatically when the intercomponent interactions have opposite sign to intracomponent ones , as discussed in the following .      in this case , the original intracomponent interactions are repulsive , while the original intracomponent ones are attractive .",
    "different to the above case , there are many interesting effects induced from the competition between such two kinds of atom - atom interactions . for example , the stability of static solitonic excitations in two - component becs have been analyzed within the gross - pitaevskii approximation @xcite . for convenience , we assume the intercomponent atom - atom interactions to be @xmath110 in our numerical simulations .    as analyzed in above case , the bos are destroyed by the nonlinearities . from this point ,",
    "the dynamical behaviors of the wave packet in the present case show no difference to the above one .",
    "however , we can prolong the coherent time of the bos dramatically by tuning the relative separation @xmath44 of the potentials felt by the two components in the present case . to confirm this",
    ", we plot the time evolutions of the wave - packet centers @xmath96 and widths @xmath103 in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] for different relative separations .",
    "a large @xmath44 means a large distances between the nearest neighbors of the wannier wave functions , which in turn induces a small intercomponent interaction rate @xmath111 .",
    "[ fig:5](a , d ) show the breakdown of the bos when the intercomponent interactions are small for a large @xmath44 . with the decrease of @xmath44 ,",
    "the intercomponent interactions get stronger .",
    "the damping of bos are obviously slowed down [ fig .",
    "[ fig:5](b , e ) ] . especially , it is noticed that @xmath103 shows revival at about @xmath112 , as the dashed line in fig . [",
    "fig:5](e ) .",
    "it provides a valuable guidance that the dynamics of the system would show revival in this case . if the relative separation @xmath44 is further reduced so that the two lattices are extremely close , the bos show obvious revival [ fig .",
    "[ fig:5](c , f ) ] .",
    "this phenomenon is caused by the competition between the intercomponent and intracomponent interactions .",
    "because the intracomponent interactions have inverse sign with the intercomponent ones , the nonlinearities contributed from the intracomponent interactions are partially counteracted by the intercomponent ones . for the full overlap at @xmath113 , the two components perfectly mix together and attenuations of bos reappear . to sum up",
    ", the coherent time of the bos can be much enhanced by only tuning the relative separation @xmath44 of the optical lattices",
    ".    however , in many situations , such finite enhancement to the dephasing time of bos is not enough , and one is desired to preserve the bos forever .",
    "this actually can also be achieved by modulating the interactions by a suitable time - dependent field .",
    "[ fig:6 ] shows that the bos are entirely stabilized by modulating interactions harmonically in time with the same frequency as the one of the bos .",
    "such stabilization is independent of the magnitudes of the nonlinearities , so the behaviors for different @xmath44 under the modulation are same , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6](a , b ) .",
    "in summary , we have studied analytically and numerically the dynamical behaviors of the bos for two - component becs trapped in combined potentials consisting of linear potentials and spin - dependent optical lattices .",
    "we found that the damped bos can be stabilized when all the atom - atom interactions are modulated synchronously and harmonically in time with bloch frequency .",
    "moreover , if the intercomponent and the intracomponent interactions have inverse signs , it has been shown that the dephasing time of bos can be much enhanced by decreasing the relative separation of the two potentials felt by the two components .",
