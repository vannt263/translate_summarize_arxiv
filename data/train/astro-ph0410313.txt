    "pulsation modes have been observed in isolated white dwarfs for several decades . since the observed",
    "mode periods are sensitive to the wd structure , an industry has emerged to estimate parameters such as wd mass , light element envelope mass , and rotation rate from observed the mode periods ( for a review , see e.g. bradley 1998 ) .",
    "gw lib is the first discovered accreting , pulsating white dwarf @xcite .",
    "it is the shortest orbital period cataclysmic variable ( cv ) known at @xmath3 min @xcite , and is observed to have dwarf nova outbursts . in the last few years , a handful of additional accreting pulsators have been found in dwarf nova systems ( see table [ tab : periods ] ) and roughly a dozen more are expected , raising the possibility of using seismology to determine parameters for a number of accreting wd in cv s .",
    "mass determinations for wd in cv s are especially interesting due to possible implications for progenitor systems of type ia supernovae . thought to be",
    "accreting wds near the chandrasekhar mass @xcite , these progenitors are closely related to the cv population , but the precise nature of this relationship is unknown .",
    "important clues in this mystery lie in how the masses of cv primary wds change over the accreting lifetime of the binary , but progress is hampered by the difficulty of measuring cv primary masses @xcite .",
    "this mass evolution , as well as measuring the accreted mass directly with seismology , is also important for determining how much , if any , of the original wd material has been ejected into the ism in classical nova outbursts , contributing to the ism metallicity @xcite .

    "next we discuss possible mechanisms for how modes might be driven in accreting wd .",
    "we outline the differences between seismology for the accretors and isolated wd .",
    "in this section we first contrast the structure of accreting versus isolated wd , and then discuss how these differences in structure affect the mode periods .",
    "isolated wd are observed to pulsate in narrow ranges of temperature : @xmath7 for hydrogen ( dav ) envelopes @xcite and @xmath8 for helium ( dbv ) .",
    "sedimentation times near the wd surface are sufficiently short that the composition is essentially pure h or he for these relatively old wd .",
    "isolated wd are passively cooling , with the flux being generated by the hot c / o core .",
    "the size of the surface layer of light elements ( h or he ) is determined by late stages of nuclear burning and winds , and is rather poorly constrained by stellar evolution theory .",
    "envelopes in wd accreting from a companion inherit the componion s composition .",
    "the envelope thickness builds to the ignition mass @xmath9 at which point a thermonuclear runaway occurs , ejecting some fraction of the envelope , and the process starts over .",
    "accretion at a time - averaged rate @xmath10 generates a ",
    "compressional heating \" luminosity @xcite @xmath11 at the base of the envelope , and determines the equilibrium core temperature over long ( @xmath12 ) timescales .",
    "the temperature profile differs from an isolated wd since the flux is generated at the base of the envelope , not uniformly in the core .",
    "gravity waves ( g - modes ) are restored by buoyancy in stably stratified regions .",
    "the dispersion relation for short wavelength g - modes is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the brunt - vaisalla ( buoyancy ) frequency , @xmath15 is the angular wavenumber for a mode with angular dependence @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the vertical wavenumber .",
    "waves propagate where the vertical wavelength is shorter than the characteristic lengthscale associated with the background .",
    "hence waves are reflected from the center and surface , and composition discontinuities act to create separate resonant cavities , at least for long wavelength modes . for massive and/or cold wd with solid cores , g - modes can not penetrate the core . the propagation diagram for a model of gw lib with wd mass @xmath18 and envelope mass @xmath19",
    "is shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig : propint ] .",
    "the large peak in @xmath14 at @xmath20 is due to the change in mean molecular weight in the transition layer from the solar composition accreted envelope to the c / o core . in the roughly constant flux envelope , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the depth into the star from the surface . in the degenerate core",
    ", @xmath23 drops rapidly toward the center , where @xmath24 is the electron fermi energy and @xmath25 is the pressure scale height .",
    "the contribution to the eigenfrequency from a particular part of the star can be estimated from the wkb phase integral @xmath26^{1/2 } \\omega^{-1 } \\int dr n(r)/r \\approx n\\pi$ ] , hence @xmath27 , where we have taken the radius to be approximately constant in the last expression .",
    "the integrand is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : propint ] , representing the number of nodes per decade in pressure .",
    "shown are two wd models : an accreting model with @xmath18 and @xmath28 used in our mode analysis ( solid line ) , and a non - accreting model with the same @xmath29 ( dashed line ) and composition .",
    "not shown in figure [ fig : propint ] , but perhaps the largest effect , is the difference due to the envelope mean molecular weight , @xmath30 , from the case of a pure h or he envelope to one of solar compositon . such a change is reflected in the periods as @xmath31 , since the envelope is well - approximated by an @xmath32 polytrope .",
    "the non - accreting model also has a higher @xmath33 than the accreting model by about @xmath34 , leading to two important effects : ( 1 ) the wkb integrand has a higher value in the core for the non - accreting model ( @xmath35 ) , and ( 2 ) the solid core is smaller , pushing the inner boundary condition deeper into the star",
    ". both effects directly influence the observed periods , and period spacings , hence _",
    "it is essential to use a wd model including the effects of compressional heating and nuclear burning _ , rather than a passively cooling wd model .    to get an analytic idea for how stellar parameters can be estimated from mode frequencies ,",
    "consider first the nondegenerate envelope . in this region , @xmath36 giving a frequency @xmath37^{1/2 } n^{-1 } ( g / h)^{1/2 } ( h / r)$ ] for a mode with quantum numbers @xmath38 and @xmath39 trapped in an envelope with base scale height @xmath40 and stellar radius @xmath41 .",
    "for a mode trapped in the degenerate core , @xmath42^{1/2 } n^{-1 } ( g / h)^{1/2 } ( k_bt_{\\rm core}/e_f)^{1/2}$ ] . given observed mode periods , and assumptions about the @xmath38 quantum number , one can attempt to identify the @xmath39 quantum number of the modes , and infer stellar parameters such as mass and envelope mass using these expressions .",
    "townsley , arras , and bildsten ( 2004 ) have used the model of accreting wd thermal structure from townsley and bildsten ( 2004 ) in the first study of seismology of accreting wd .",
    "they computed oscillation mode periods using an adiabatic code , and identified the wd model most consistent with the three observed mode periods ( assumed to be dipole ) for gw lib , the best observed accreting pulsating wd .",
    "the best fit was a wd mass @xmath18 and accreted envelope mass @xmath43 .",
    "such a large inferred wd mass has consequences for mode excitation , discussed in the next section .",
    "we are motivated to understand how mode excitation might be different in accreting wd for two reasons .",
    "first , szkody et.al .",
    "( 2003 ) have determined an effective temperature for gw lib of @xmath44 , depending on how the fit was done .",
    "these estimates are well above the standard dav instability strip @xmath45 , implying that convective driving , and also the @xmath46-mechanism , can not drive the pulsations for a fiducial @xmath47 pure hydrogen envelope .",
    "secondly , the wd mass may have increased after @xmath48 s of accretion , motivating study of wd heavier than the canonical @xmath47 . a large literature exists on excitation of g - modes in isolated wd .",
    "initially investigators expected the  @xmath46-mechanism \" , associated with opacity variations in an ionization zone , was the driving mechanism @xcite .",
    "later , with penetrating insight , brickhill realized that the response of surface convection zones to a g - mode pulsation naturally acts to pump more energy into the mode , hence the name ",
    "convective driving \" @xcite . wu and goldreich",
    "have confirmed brickhill s result , and extended its consequences , notably in the area of nonlinear saturation mechanisms ( see the series of papers starting with goldreich and wu 1999 ) .",
    "the criterion for a mode to be unstable is roughly @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the mode frequency , @xmath51 is the period , and @xmath52 is the thermal time at the base of the ionization zone , which coincides with the base of the convection zone . the  blue edge \" of the instability strip in effective temperature occurs when the shortest period g - mode is unstable by this criterion ; g - modes should be observed for temperatures below the blue edge . for dav and dbv s , observationally there is a  red edge \" below which pulsations are not observed .",
    "the reason for this cutoff is not as well understood , but may have to do with the luminosity perturbation becoming small , even if the mode amplitude is large ( brickhill 1983 ) .",
    "what is the instability strip for accreting wd ?",
    "here we investigate the thermal time at the base of the convection zones as a function of gravity ( fig.[fig : tthbczg ] ) .",
    "we use the opal opacity and equation of state @xcite to construct solar composition , plane parallel , constant gravity and flux envelopes , using standard mixing length @xcite in convective regions . in fig.[fig : tthbczg ] , gravity is varied from @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) to @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "we define a fiducial blue edge to be at @xmath57 .",
    "this blue edge moves to the right by @xmath58 over a factor of 10 change in gravity .",
    "we confirm the suggestion by szkody et.al .",
    "( 2003 ) that gw lib may pulsate because it is a massive wd .",
    "if gw lib has a high surface gravity such that the blue edge moves up to @xmath59 , it may overlap with the lower value stated for the observed @xmath29 .",
    "a large wd mass @xmath60 was also preferred in the parameter estimation of townsley et.al .",
    "( 2004 ) using seismology .",
    "additional factors not discussed here may influence seismology and g - mode driving in accreting wd .",
    "the structure of composition transition layers is different for accretors due to the downward accretion flow , and the composition of layers overlying the core is uncertain due to classical novae .",
    "hydrogen depleted donor stars are expected for binaries with orbital periods @xmath61 , increasing the blue edge somewhere in between that of dav s and dbv s .",
    "metals may act as an additional _ damping _ mechanism ( cool wd are on the wrong side of the  metal bump \" ) . sedimentation in between dwarf novae outbursts may occur in the accreted near solar composition layer , even down to the driving region at @xmath62 , creating helium  puddles \" sandwiched in between hydrogen and solar composition layers .",
    "seismology for wd spun up even to modest rotation rates will be quite different than the nonrotating case , changing the expected mode periods qualitatively .",
    "finally , new instability strips may occur outside the traditional dav and dbv regions due to changes in mode properties arising from rapid rotation .",
