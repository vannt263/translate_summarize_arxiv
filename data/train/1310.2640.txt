    "an infrared excess ( ir ) around mature stars , measured as the flux in excess to that expected purely from the stellar photosphere , is produced by orbiting dust particles .",
    "this dust is destroyed by physical processes such as poynting - robertson drag , radiation pressure and photoevaporization in timescales much shorter than the stellar age and therefore , it must be replenished by collisions of planetesimals .    since the unexpected discovery of an ir excess around vega ( @xmath3 lyrae , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , infrared observations from space confirmed that the presence of circumstellar discs around main sequence ( ms ) stars is a common phenomenon @xcite .",
    "however , these objects show a large distribution in dust temperature ( @xmath4 ) and mass and , while it is common to find cold debris discs ( @xmath5  k ) , warm discs around this type of stars are indeed unusual and have been detected for a few stars ( see , e.  g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in spite of their rarity",
    ", there are strong motivations for their study and they have posed interesting theoretical challenges to explain their presence and relatively large masses . on the one hand , warm material",
    "is expected to be close to the host star , within a few astronomical units , therefore , they represent valuable laboratories to study the potential correlation between the detected material and the presence of larger bodies ( planets ) in orbits similar to that of the earth . on the other hand , their fractional luminosities ,",
    "well above the estimated fractional luminosity of the solar system zodiacal dust cloud @xcite , escape explanations through the models of terrestrial planet formation @xcite or the steady state planetesimal grinding , and have to be formed through other mechanisms such as transient events @xcite .",
    "two main approaches have been suggested to explain the origin of hot dust : one of them considers a temporary increment in collisions due to dynamical instabilities , causing a so - called late heavy bombardment .",
    "such a scenario has been proposed by @xcite to account for the debris disc around @xmath6 corvi .",
    "the second mechanism is the catastrophic collision of two rocky , planetary - scale bodies , which could explain the debris disc around bd+20  307 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of warm debris discs not only is important to understand the dynamical evolution and the presence of small bodies in planetary systems , but also to understand the formation of terrestrial planets and the history of our solar system .    in this context , the recent wide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ) mission @xcite is certainly providing a fresher benchmark for characterising warm circumstellar material around main sequence stars . _",
    "wise _ has conducted an all sky survey with an unprecedented sensitivity ( orders of magnitude better than its early predecessor _ iras _ ) in four bands : 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath1 m , denoted as w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 , respectively . _ wise _ data , together with the outcomes from _ akari _ ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , represent valuable means for demographic studies of warm circumstellar material . to date , most stellar analyses involving _ wise _ data had focused on stellar samples aimed at searching for ir excesses in stars observed by the _ kepler _ mission , including stars that are known to host transiting planetary companions @xcite , and identifying possible correlations of mid - ir excesses and rotation @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a study of the _ wise _ data base with the goal of searching excesses at 22  @xmath1 m within a comprehensive magnitude - limited sample of sun - like stars .",
    "the resulting set of excess candidates and the parameters derived for the circumstellar material will serve as a basis for future studies at longer wavelengths , which may shed light on the frequency and properties of warm circumstellar discs around this kind of stars .",
    "the sample was constructed through a selection process that started by querying the simbad database for main sequence stars .",
    "we imposed a limiting magnitude of v@xmath015  mag , luminosity class v , and spectral types between f2 and k0 .",
    "we also required 2mass data to be available . from this first selection we got the information of nearly 29000 stars .",
    "it is important to note that the query by criteria in simbad results in a wide variety of stellar sources with the vast majority ( 90% ) corresponding to objects whose object type is _ only _ an asterisk ( * ) , this is , stars which do not present or has not been identified any peculiarity ( binarity , variability , etc . ) .",
    "the other most prominent stellar groups within this sample are stars in binary or multiple systems ( 5% ) , pre - main sequence objects ( 2% ) , stars in clusters and associations ( 2% ) , and the remaining corresponding to a wide variety of stellar sources , mainly variable stars of different types .",
    "_ wise _ is a nasa funded explorer mission that was launched at the end of 2009 and conducted an all sky survey in four ir bands , with an angular resolution of 6.1 , 6.4 , 6.5 , and 12.0  arcsec for w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 , respectively . in spite of having slightly more than a third of the collecting area of its most immediate predecessor _",
    "akari _ , its high performance detectors ( with 4 million pixels ) pushed down the limiting flux density to about 6  mjy at 22  @xmath1 m , which is nearly 20 times better than that of _ akari _ at 18  @xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "the _ wise _ all sky data release contains information of more than 500 million objects , half of which are expected to be stellar sources , with an astrometric accuracy of better than 0.5  arcsec even for faint sources .",
    "the enhanced wise sensitivity has provided and will provide in years to come access to a number of previously unidentified mid - ir excesses around solar - like stars .",
    "we used the stellar coordinates to identify _ wise _ counter parts .",
    "the constraints we imposed for the selection were _ wise _ sources to be located within one arcsecond in radius and that reported fluxes at all _ wise _ bands have signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) larger than 5 .",
    "additionally , following the criteria described in @xcite , we have also excluded objects whose _ wise _ data , in one or more bands , appear flagged as having contamination of halos , diffraction spikes , and optical ghosts due to nearby bright sources , as well as those flagged as extended sources . we have also excluded objects that are labelled as saturated in any of the w2 , w3 , and w4 bands , i.e. some of our objects after this selection might be saturated in the w1 band . after this process",
    "the sample was reduced to about 9500 detected objects .",
    "even though we do not expect interstellar extinction to be important for many objects in this later set , we have applied an extinction correction at the j , k@xmath7 and w2 bands to those objects for which we identified reddening in excess of e(b - v)=0.05  mag .",
    "reddening has been estimated from the comparison of the b - v color available in simbad and the color index  spectral type calibration of @xcite .",
    "the extinction curve used for this procedure was that of @xcite .",
    "for the w4 band no extinction correction was applied , since at this wavelength the interstellar reddening is expected to have negligible effects .    detections are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we plot the _ wise _ flux ratio w4/w2 versus the 2mass flux ratio j / k@xmath7 , for the entire sample . as a reference we have overplotted ( connected stars ) the theoretical photospheric line constructed from nextgen model fluxes @xcite in the effective temperature ( @xmath8 ) range 4000 - 7000  k with the step available in the model flux library of 200  k. all theoretical fluxes are of solar chemical composition and surface gravity @xmath9=4.5  dex .",
    "note that most data points clearly cluster around the photospheric line , and that point clustering extends well beyond these effective temperature limits , particularly at the lower temperature edge .",
    "this extension is most probably due to the low temperature ( @xmath10  k ) members of binaries and multiple systems , both identified or probably still unidentified , and to reddened objects .",
    "note also that numerous objects in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are located well away from the photospheric line , hence plausibly corresponding to objects with prominent excesses .",
    "in order to determine if there is an excess and its quantification , we measured the difference between the observed flux ratios w4/w2 and theoretical photospheric predictions for a given j / k@xmath7 and compared with the corresponding error @xmath11 .",
    "errors in our data points have been calculated by considering three different sources : photometric errors @xmath12 , calibrations uncertainties @xmath13 , and errors associated with the photospheric parameters @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath12 was obtained from the quoted uncertainties available within the _ wise _ data release for each band .",
    "absolute calibration uncertainties of _ wise _ are estimated to be 2.4 , 2.8 , 4.5 and 5.7% for the w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 , respectively @xcite .",
    "for @xmath14 we considered the effects of varying surface gravity ( @xmath15 ) and metallicity ( @xmath16 } \\leq 0.0 $ ] ) , once an effective temperature is assigned to each star by matching its j / k@xmath7 color with the nextgen theoretical fluxes .",
    "the total error budget is then @xmath17 . for the vast majority of the detected objects",
    "@xmath18 is the dominant source of uncertainty .",
    "we have considered an excess whenever @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the extinction corrected observed color , and @xmath21 is the theoretical photospheric flux ratio calculated using the appropriate transmission functions and color corrections @xcite . through this analysis we obtained a total of 313 excess candidates . at this stage",
    "it is necessary to elaborate in some cautionary notes on the reliability of these excesses .",
    "as a first step to assess on the quality of the excess candidates , we have carefully visually inspected images at the four bands for each of the 313 objects .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] summarises the results of this examination .",
    "we found numerous spurious detections in which no object is evident in the w4 band .",
    "an example of this situation is illustrated in the top two panels of the figure for the star hd  78710 .",
    "the object is clearly present in w2 ( left ) and absent in w4 ( right ) .",
    "this effect is a product of the source extraction in the _ wise _ pipeline processing and the complex backgrounds that characterise w4 images . in the second row of panels",
    "we show another case , exemplified by the star v900  per , in which infrared emission at 22  @xmath1 m is detected , but can not be associated with a point source . in the third row",
    "we display the case of hd  227748 where there is an offset in the position of the source identified in w2 with respect to that in w4 , and , in any case , the faint source can not be unambiguously distinguished from emission peaks of the interstellar medium .",
    "objects in the above described cases ( 116 stars ) were rejected leaving the final sample with 197 objects . in the panels at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we illustrate an excess detection case for hd  107899 .",
    "the star is clearly visible in the w4 band , even if it appears located within a region with difusse emission .",
    "however , many detections correspond to well isolated point sources .    5 arcmin images of hd  78710 , v900  per , hd  227748 , and hd  107899 ; north is up and east is left .",
    "the color scale spans from 0 to 20 times the standard deviation of the background for w2 , while for w4 the interval is reduced to 03@xmath2 .",
    "the three upper panels show objects that we classified as non - detections in w4 , while hd  107899 is included in our catalog .",
    "[ fig2],width=317 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we illustrate the distribution of sources with excesses at w4 .",
    "the y - axis gives the flux ratios ( w4/w2)@xmath22 normalised to the expected photospheric values versus j / k@xmath7 .",
    "the largest excess corresponds to the f5v type hd  39415 , which is the only _ iras _ source in our set of excess candidates .",
    "this object was not detected at 60 and 100  @xmath1 m and its flux at 25  @xmath1 m was labeled as of moderate quality .",
    "note that in the determination of excesses we have implicitly considered that the 2mass fluxes and the flux at w2 are purely photospheric , as assumed in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this assumption might not be correct for the few young stellar objects included in the sample .",
    "the object - type statistics for the 3@xmath2 sample closely resembles that of the original sample from simbad : isolated field stars account for the majority ( about 90% ) , while the remaining objects belong to various stellar types ( stars in double systems , pre - main sequence stars , etc . ) .",

    "most of the 3@xmath2 excesses are found in objects closer than 300  pc .",
    "there are , however , four objects farther away .",
    "note the absence of the nearest stars ( with distances less than 47  pc ) in the histogram .",
    "the reason for this is explained by the adopted selection requirements for searching within the _ wise _ database , as nearer objects are sources flagged as extended , saturated , and/or affected by one or more of the above mentioned optical artifacts in the w2 band .",

    "we have identified a sample of 197 main - sequence objects that display 3@xmath2 ir excesses , many of which are present at both w3 and w4 _ wise _ bands .",
    "this number corresponds to about 2% of the parent sample of _ wise _ detections . in our resulting sample of ir excesses ,",
    "20 have previously reported observations in the mid - ir .",

    "this integrated sed was obtained following three steps .",

    "second , we created an extensive grid of black body flux densities for temperatures ( @xmath25 ) in the range 20 - 500  k ( at a step of 1  k ) , and fractional luminosities ( @xmath26 ) @xcite , in the interval 10@xmath27 - 10@xmath28 .",
    "third , we conducted a @xmath29 minimization that provided the combination of @xmath25 and @xmath26 that best fit _ wise _ bands .",
    "the best fit values are indicated in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we list some of the sample stars for which we identified a prominent ir excess .",
    "the table provides the stellar identification , the full set of object types available in simbad , the v magnitude and spectral types as given in simbad , the stellar effective temperature and its uncertainty derived from the quoted errors in the j and k@xmath7 , the normalised flux ratios w3/w2@xmath22 and w4/w2@xmath22 associated with the snrs at the w3 and w4 bands . in the last two columns , we report the estimates for the dust temperature and fractional luminosities and their uncertainties , that were obtained fitting the _ wise _ fluxes@xmath30 . a label after the identification indicates those objects included in previous ir observational programs .",
    "the table with the full stellar sample is available in electronic form .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we plot the distribution of the black body temperature associated to the 197 disc candidates of our sample .",
    "the majority of the stars ( 161 out of 197 ) have warm circumstellar material with @xmath31  k , with a peak around 180  k ; this result was expected because of the wavelength range covered by the _ wise _ observations .",
    "about 46% ( 90 ) of the stars also show 3@xmath2 excesses in w3 indicated with the shaded area in the figure .",
    "note that this later subsample clearly occupies the hotter end of the distribution . in these cases we have at least two non - photospheric points available to determine the black body properties",
    ", hence the fitting procedure provides better estimates of the disc parameters . in general , the relative errors of both @xmath25 and @xmath26 in objects with w3 and w4 excesses are lower than in objects displaying an excess in only w4 . in contrast , the distribution of fractional luminosities ( see fig .  [ fig7 ] ) does not indicate any particular trend for stars displaying also a w3 excess .",
    "the vast majority of excess stars present a disc fractional luminosity in the interval @xmath32 .",
    "however , ten sources have a very strong ir excess , with @xmath33 , and nine of them appear to have a very low temperature estimate ( @xmath34  k ) .",
    "the star yz  cep , also has a large fractional luminosity , and exhibits the hottest disc of our sample ( @xmath35  k ; see fig .",

    "yz  cep is an irregular variable of rw aurigae type @xcite and it is classified as a t  tauri star @xcite .",
    "another object that presents a hot disc is hd  23514 .",
    "our modelling provides a dust temperature of 405  k which is significantly lower than 750  k obtained by @xcite .",
    "this difference is most probably due to the fact that we conducted the fit at longer wavelengths ( w3 , w4 ) , while @xcite fit the data up to @xmath36  @xmath1 m .    in the analysis here presented ,",
    "we have examined _ wise _ images to identify false detections . such scrutiny turned out to be of fundamental importance since , as we have demonstrated , nominal high quality fluxes in the _ wise _ database do not always correspond to a detected source .",
    "the lack of this double - check process yielded contrasting results in searches for ir excesses in stars of the _ kepler _ field @xcite . to further check on the reliability of our reported excesses",
