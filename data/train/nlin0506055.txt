    "usually deterministic and stochastic analysis are not considered compatible . on one hand",
    "we are often limited to statistical analysis when dealing with experimental time series . on the other hand",
    "a purely stochastic approach to data analysis may lead to an erroneous interpretation about the genesis of the analyzed system .    in this work",
    ", we investigate , whether it is possible to substitute the lyapunov exponent with a statistical measure , at least in simple 1-d systems . this may be valuable in the case when we do not know what is the equation behind the process we observe .",
    "it may also be useful when it is technically difficult to calculate the lyapunov exponent  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use the so - called general random walk as our main model  @xcite .",
    "we analyze the properties of this model when the noise components of the walk are generated by a stochastic process or a deterministic process (  the tent map ) . using detrended fluctuation analysis  ( _ dfa _ )  @xcite we compare the time series obtained from the above implementations of the model .",
    "the conclusion is that both implementations of the model lead to the same results . as a consequence of this observation",
    ", we calculate the lyapunov exponent for the deterministic version of model .",
    "the result is an equation relating the dfa exponents ( a statistical measure ) with the lyapunov exponent for our model , which is practically independent of the method used to generate noise . using the lyapunov exponent we may calculate the diffusion coefficient for a particle",
    ", which movement is defined by the model . by doing this",
    "we also doublecheck that the deterministic implementation of the model has the same statistical properties as the purely stochastic one .",
    "detrended fluctuation analysis ( _ dfa _ ) has been originally applied to the dna walk  @xcite . therefore in general one needs to define a walk that is related to the input series analogously  @xcite . to do this ,",
    "the input series @xmath0 of length @xmath1 is integrated after subtracting their average value .",
    "the series @xmath2 is then : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the @xmath5-th point of a discrete time series and @xmath6 is the average value of the data .",
    "next , the integrated series is divided into subintervals of equal length @xmath7 , and for each subinterval a linear least squares fit to the @xmath8 , denoted @xmath9 , is made  ( fig .  1 ) .",

    "when scaling occurs , the overall slope of the line in the double - logarithmic scale is equal to the dfa exponent and denoted by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the intercept of the approximated trend .    generally , when a scaling @xmath15 is observed , the scaling exponent in the range @xmath16 indicates positive long - range power - law correlations ( in other words , persistence ) and @xmath17 infers anticorrelations ( antipersistence ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 is obtained for the brownian walk . the exponent @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "2a ) corresponds to uncorrelated data .    if there are short - range correlations , the slope for low @xmath7 may differ from 0.5 but it will approach this value for large @xmath7 . a crossover occurs when for different ranges of @xmath7 we observe different slopes @xcite .",
    "crossovers in the linear dependence of the exponent on window size n have been observed in detrended fluctuation analysis of complex data ( biological data ) and may be an important indicator characterizing the underlying process @xcite .",
    "we define the model by the iterative equation :    [ eq3 ] @xmath20 here , @xmath7 is the iteration index ( a natural number ) , @xmath21 is the variable value at the @xmath7-th iteration and @xmath22 is the noise term .",
    "the model equation ( [ eq3a ] ) is equivalent to : @xmath23    as explicitly written in equation ( [ eq3b ] ) , our model is a system with memory , the range of which is defined by parameter @xmath24 .",
    "this is an analogy to the general random walk process  @xcite .",
    "we use two processes to generate the noise @xmath22 - a stochastic and a deterministic one . in the _ first _ approach",
    "we use a stochastic process that has a uniform distribution with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    as a _",
    "second _ approach we generate noise using chaotic maps .",
    "the following equation defines the tent map ( also known as the symmetric triangular map )  @xcite : @xmath27 it is well - known  @xcite that iterating eq .",
    "( [ tentb ] ) generates data which is equivalent to statistically uncorrelated noise with a uniform i.i.d .",
    "distribution . in other words ,",
    "the natural invariant density  @xcite for the tent map  ( [ tentb ] ) is equal to @xmath28 .    in this paper",
    "we also consider the generation of noise using the ulam map  (  the logistic map at fully developed chaos )  @xcite : @xmath29 the main difference between the maps ( [ ulam ] ) and ( [ tentb ] ) is that the natural invariant density for the ulam map does not correspond to the uniform distribution  @xcite , instead it is equal to : @xmath30 as we will show further , the differences between the maps ( [ tentb ] ) and ( [ ulam ] ) will not affect the results presented in this paper . to obtain a simple correspondence with the parameter @xmath21 we define @xmath22 as : @xmath31 what is important for our study , this approach does not alter the slope of the chaotic map therefore it preserves the value of the lyapunov exponent ( though it introduces singularities ) .",

    "2 we observe a crossover for series obtain with parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the point of crossover is found to be dependent on the parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the dependence is a power - law and for larger @xmath24 it occurs at larger @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "a similar relation between the correlation range and the crossover point was assumed in @xcite ( without proof or reference to a model ) and applied to the analysis of the heart rate variability series .",
    "we can find this dependence between the crossover point @xmath33 and parameter @xmath24 from numerical data  ( fig .",
    "3 ) :    @xmath34    therefore , it is possible to obtain the parameter @xmath24 of the model ( [ eq3 ] ) _ only by analyzing the time series ( experimental data ) _ , using the statistical method dfa .    for a pure random walk  ( @xmath35 ) it is easy to find the diffusion coefficient @xmath36 , which in the general case is defined as  @xcite : @xmath37 as @xmath35 , eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) becomes    [ purerw ] @xmath38 and , equivalently @xmath39    therefore the diffusion coefficient of the pure random walk ( [ purerw ] ) is equal to : @xmath40      the dependence of the properties of chaotic maps on the control parameter is usually described by the lyapunov exponent , which is a measure of the memory of the initial conditions .",
    "the lyapunov exponent for one - dimensional iterated maps is calculated as  @xcite :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 corresponds to the @xmath5-th iteration of the map @xmath43 ( in our case defined by eq . ( [ eq3 ] ) ) and",
    "@xmath44 is the initial condition .",
    "a negative value of @xmath45 indicates periodic states , a positive @xmath45 - chaotic states . in general the lyapunov exponent",
    "is dependent of the initial condition @xmath44 , but in the case of the map defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath46 .    instead of calculating the lyapunov exponent using the long - time limit @xmath47 as in eq .",
    "( [ lap ] ) , this exponent may be calculated as the average of all the possible values of the one - step finite - time lyapunov exponent @xmath48  @xcite : @xmath49    first , we will consider the case of the pure random walk , when @xmath35 .",
    "the lyapunov exponent ( eq .  ( [ lap ] ) ) for the above general walk can be easily found if we note , that the inversion of the tent map ( [ tentb ] ) gives two symmetric preimages @xmath22 for each @xmath50  @xcite .    to calculate the exponent @xmath45 in our model we need to find the product of @xmath51 preimages . however , eq .  ( [ lap1 ] ) is the average of one - step lyapunov exponents @xmath48 . due to the symmetry of the preimages of ( [ tentb ] ) , there are two equally probable ( in the statistical sense , as @xmath7 tends to infinity ) values of @xmath48 , namely @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "therefore the lyapunov exponent for the pure random walk is equal to : @xmath54 we obtain the same calculation in the case of the ulam map  ( [ ulam ] ) .",
    "now we will derive the relation between the lyapunov exponent and the memory parameter m for the general random walk . at first , this seems a difficult task , because this time we have to find the values of the derivatives of all the preimages of @xmath55 up to @xmath51 possible values of @xmath56 .",
    "this step is a little similar to the construction of the julia set , in the way that one needs to find calculate all the preimages values  ( compare @xcite , p.104 ) .",
    "yet it is well - known that the julia set is quite complex . on the contrary , in this case , after simple calculations , a finite sum of a geometrical progression is obtained , and eq .",

    "this is due to the symmetry of the two preimages in both the logistic map and the tent map .",
    "concluding , we see that the lyapunov equation depends only on the parameter @xmath24 and can be calculated from the equation : @xmath58 .",

    "( [ lappurerw ] ) which was calculated earlier for more clarity .",
    "the important observation now is that using the dfa method we have obtained the relation between the the crossover point @xmath33 and @xmath24  ( eq .  ( [ logm ] ) , see fig .",
    "this relation is valid for both the statistical model of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and the deterministic models of eqs .",
