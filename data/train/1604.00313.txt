    "in quantum technology , it is very common to summarize the results of a reconstruction technique , either full quantum tomography @xcite or some partial reconstruction scheme @xcite , by the use of fidelity @xcite .",
    "once the information about the state of a system has been extracted from a set of experimental data , the fidelity between the reconstructed state and a given target state , is calculated .",
    "fidelity is bounded to the interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "high values such as @xmath1 or @xmath2 are thus considered as a piece of evidence in order to certify that the reconstructed and the target states i ) are very close each other in the hilbert space , ii ) they share nearly identical physical properties . in this framework",
    ", quantum resources of the prepared state are often benchmarked with those of the target one , e.g. to assess the performances of a teleportation scheme @xcite .",
    "the two statements above may appear rather intuitive , with the second one following from the first one .",
    "on the other hand , it has been suggested that the use of fidelity may be misleading in several situations involving either discrete or continuous variable systems @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to experimentally confirm the first statement and , at the same time , to provide neat examples where the second one is clearly proved wrong .    given two quantum states described by density matrices @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the fidelity between them is defined as @xcite @xmath5 ^ 2\\,.\\ ] ] fidelity is not a proper distance in the hilbert space .",
    "however , it can be easily linked to a distance , and in turn to a metric over the manifold of density matrices .",
    "in fact , the bures distance between two states is defined as @xmath6}\\,.\\ ] ] fidelity also provides an upper and a lower bound to the trace distance , namely @xcite : @xmath7 these relationships ensure that higher values of fidelity correspond to geometrical proximity of the two states in the hilbert space .",
    "however , they do not seem straightforwardly related to the physical properties of the two states . in turn",
    ", it has been pointed out @xcite that a pair of states that appear very close to each other in terms of fidelity , may be very far in terms of physical resources .",
    "relevant examples may be found with bipartite systems of either qubits or cv gaussian states , where pairs of states composed by one entangled and one separable states may have ( very ) high value of fidelity one to each other . besides , for single - mode cv states high values of fidelity may be achieved by pairs including one state with a classical analogue and a genuinely quantum state of the field .    in this paper",
    ", we address the problem experimentally and analyze in details the significance of fidelity as a figure of merit to assess the properties of tomographycally reconstructed state .",
    "we address both discrete and continuous variable systems using quantum homodyne tomography to reconstruct cv states and maximum - likelihood polarization tomography for dv ones .",
    "in particular , we experimentally address two relevant examples : i ) the reconstruction of squeezed thermal states of a single - mode radiation field , analyzing in details the quantum - to - classical transition ; and ii ) the reconstruction of noisy werner states of a two - qubit polarization system , inspecting the amount of non - classical correlations .",
    "our results clearly show that high values of fidelity , despite well quantifying geometrical closeness between states in the hilbert space , may be obtained for quantum states displaying very different physical properties , e.g. quantum resources .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "[ s : sts ] is devoted to continuous variables : we first describe the experimental generation of single - mode squeezed thermal states using a seeded optical amplifier , as well as the homodyne technique employed for tomography .",
    "we then present experimental results , illustrating in details the significance of the fidelity of the reconstructed state to a target one and its non - classicality . in sect .",
    "[ s : werner ] we illustrate the experimental setup for generating two - qubit states of werner type and the method of maximum - likelihood estimation for tomography .",
    "we then present experimental results , analysing the significance of fidelity of the reconstructed states to the target werner ones in assessing their non - classical correlations , either entanglement or quantum discord .",
    "[ s : conclusions ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we deal with the generation and the characterization of squeezed thermal states ( sts ) of a single - mode radiation field , i.e. states of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 \\big \\}$ ] is the squeezing operator , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 is a thermal state with @xmath12 average number of photons and @xmath13=1 $ ] , @xmath14 and @xmath15 being field operators . upon defining the quadrature operators @xmath16 with @xmath17 $ ] ,",
    "the sts are fully characterized by their first and second moments    @xmath18    where @xmath19 $ ] . in terms of the canonical operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the covariance matrix ( cm ) of a sts reads @xmath22 where @xmath23= ( 2n_{\\text{th}}+1)^{-1}$ ] is the purity of the state @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the squeezing factor .",
    "a sts is nonclassical , i.e. it corresponds to a singular glauber p - function , whenever the conditions @xmath26 or @xmath27 are satisfied .",
    "the total energy of a sts is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of squeezing photons and @xmath12 is the thermal contribution to energy .    according to eq .",
    "( [ ntot ] ) , it is possible to find a suitable parametrization of the single - mode sts cm ( [ cm ] ) in terms of the different energy contributions    [ fitvariance]@xmath30    from which the linear behavior of the variances as a function of the total energy @xmath31 is apparent .    the fidelity between two sts is given by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 .      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the tomographic reconstruction is performed by measuring 16 projective and independent observables in the two - qubit hilbert space , namely @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 ) .",
    "different settings of the apparatus , obtained by combining a quarter - wave plate , a half - wave plate and a polarizer ( sectors t1 and t2 in fig .",
    "[ f : discreto ] ) , are employed @xcite .",
    "each of the 16 measurements correspond to 30 acquisitions , in a time window of @xmath37 , of coincidence photon counts @xmath38 , i.e. the outcomes of the projectors @xmath39 .",
    "the density matrix of the two - qubit states generated in the experiment has been reconstructed using maximum - likelihood ( mle ) tomographic protocol @xcite .",
    "this scheme adopts a suitable parametrization of the density matrix , namely @xmath40 $ ] , where @xmath41 is a complex lower triangular matrix and @xmath42 is the set of 16 parameters characterizing the density matrix . in this way it is ensured that @xmath24 is positive and hermitean ( choleski decomposition ) .",
    "the mle protocol allows to recover the set @xmath43 by means of a constrained optimization procedure with lagrange multipliers , which accounts for the normalization condition @xmath44=1 $ ] , involving the set of data coming from the 16 experimental measurements .",
    "in particular , the logarithmic likelihood functional to be minimized reads @xmath45 ^ 2}{2\\ , \\mathcal{n } { \\langle \\psi_{j } \\vert } \\hat{\\rho}(\\mathbb{t } ) { \\vert \\psi_{j } \\rangle } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath46 is a constant proportional to the total number of acquisitions .",
    "we experimentally generated @xmath47 two - qubit states not too far from the border between separable and entangled states ( see table  [ t : werner ] ) .",
    "mle quantum tomography shows that the reconstructed density matrices do not display the typical x - shape of an ideal werner state ( [ werner ] ) with real - valued elements .",
    "a possible route to extract the desired werner state , is based on the maximization of the fidelity between the experimental state and the generic werner state ( [ werner ] ) .",
    "this procedure sounds reasonable and , in principle , may allow one to assess the quantum resources contained in the generated state , as well as to exploit them in order to accomplish quantum tasks .",
    "on the other hand , we will show in the following that a fidelity - based inference is in general misleading and should be avoided in assessing the true quantum properties of the experimentally generated state .      in order to perform statistical analysis of data and evaluate uncertainties we have resampled photon counts data to obtain @xmath48 repeated samples for each of the @xmath47 experimental states ( see appendix [ s : mc ] for details ) .",
    "the significance of fidelity may be assessed upon the comparison between two possible strategies to reconstruct quantum properties of the generated states and their distribution . in the first strategy",
    "we evaluate properties from the reconstructed states @xmath49 ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) as obtained by the mle tomography , whereas in the second one we look for the closest werner state , in terms of fidelity , for each reconstructed state and analyze the properties of this class of werner states @xmath52^{(w)}$ ] .",
    "the first method is based only in tomographic data and provides an average mle two - qubit state @xmath53 , which optimize the likelihood of the experimental data .",
    "this average state may be then employed to infer a werner target state @xmath54 , of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ werner ] ) , via a maximization of the fidelity @xmath55 . upon adopting the second strategy",
    ", we obtain a distribution of approximated werner states , with an average state compatible , at least in principle , with the werner target state of the first strategy .",
    "the parameters @xmath56 characterizing the werner target states are reported in table  [ t : werner ] .    in the following ,",
    "we analyze how some properties of the quantum states distribute around the target states in terms of fidelity , depending on which of the two strategies has been adopted .",
    "in particular we consider the amount of quantum correlations of two - qubit states , as quantified by entanglement and quantum discord .",
    "the separability of two - qubit systems is established by the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite : a quantum state of two qubits @xmath24 is separable if and only the partially transposed density matrix is positive , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "thus , it is possible to study entanglement or separability properties by evaluating the eigenvalues of the partially transposed density matrix .",
    "we compute the minimum of these eigenvalues @xmath58 for both the considered strategies , i.e. for the distributions of resampled states @xmath49 and of the approximated werner states @xmath52^{(w)}$ ] . for a werner state",
    "the minimum eigenvalue , which may assume negative values , is given by @xmath59^\\tau)=(1 - 3p)/4 $ ] .    in fig .",
    "[ f : negativity ]  ( a ) we plot the distribution of @xmath60 as a function of the werner parameter @xmath61 for all the @xmath48 resampled states , with average tomographic states @xmath62 .",
    "we note that the average states arrange along the curve of the theoretical behavior for a werner state and that the resampled states follow the same prediction ( see table  [ t : werner ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , there is evidence of some states generated from a separable experimental state in the entangled region , and viceversa .",
    "this first observation reveals that statistical fluctuations in an experiment may still produce quantum states with properties radically different from the expected ones , such as separability and entanglement .    in fig .",
    "[ f : negativity ]  ( b ) , we focus on the most entangled state @xmath63 and compare the distribution of the resampled states and of the corresponding werner states , in terms of @xmath60 and fidelity with the target state @xmath64 . in this way we can highlight the differences between the two possible strategies for data analysis , i.e. between the evaluation of the properties of the direct tomographic states and the approximated werner states .",
    "this second strategy compel the resampled states to follow the single - parameter werner state ( [ werner ] ) and , thus , to force the distribution of the least eigenvalue @xmath65^{(\\tau)})$ ] according to the theoretical prediction ( dashed black curve in the plot ) . in this way",
    ", we obtain a distribution of werner states having , obviously , very high values of fidelity with the target ( werner ) state . on the other hand , tomographic states display lower values of fidelity with the target state , but",
    "@xmath60 is evaluated directly from the tomographic density matrices . from the statistical analysis ,",
    "we conclude that the estimated value of @xmath60 is compatible within errors for both the adopted strategies .",
    "we will see in the following that these two strategies may lead to different and non - compatible results for another property of quantum states , the quantum discord .",
    "another widely adopted measure of the amount of quantum correlations in a state @xmath24 is the quantum discord @xcite , which is defined starting from two equivalent definitions , in the classical domain , of the mutual information , i.e. the total amount of correlations of @xmath24 :    [ mi]@xmath66    where @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) is the reduced density matrix of @xmath24 for the subsystems @xmath69 ( or @xmath70 ) and @xmath71 $ ] the von neumann entropy . while the first definition ( [ mi1 ] ) is based only on the von neumann entropy , the second one in eq .",
    "( [ mi2 ] ) accounts for all the classical correlations that can be detected by local projective measurements only on a subsystem . here",
    "@xmath72/\\pi_j$ ] is the reduced state of @xmath70 conditioned to the set of projectors @xmath73 , with probability @xmath74 $ ] for the outcome @xmath75 , and the minimum in eq .",
    "( [ mi2 ] ) is taken over all the possible @xmath73 .",
    "a similar definition applies for local measurements on subsystem @xmath70 .",
    "the quantum discord is then evaluated as the residual information stemming from the difference of the two definitions in eqs .",
    "( [ mi ] ) , which has a pure quantum character : @xmath76 for a werner state ( [ werner ] ) the quantum discord can be analytically evaluated : @xmath77    , i.e. the fidelity between a set of separable states and an entangled target state .",
    "the data are well fitted by a @xmath78-distribution , centered around @xmath79 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ f : discord](a ) we plot the quantum discord @xmath80 for all the @xmath48 resampled states , with average tomographic states @xmath62 , as a function of the werner parameter @xmath61 .",
    "the theoretical behavior of eq .",
    "( [ discordw ] ) , represented in the figure by a dashed curve , puts in evidence the high discrepancy with the quantum discord computed for the tomographic states . the approximation to werner states leads to a systematic over - estimation of the quantum discord for the two - qubit states ( see also table  [ t : werner ] ) .",
    "we can enforce this result by looking at the distribution of the quantum discord relative to the single set of states @xmath81 only , as a function of the fidelity with the corresponding target werner state @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "[ f : discord](b ) ) .",
    "most of the states are contained in a region of high values of fidelity , thus suggesting that the approximation to an average werner state could be correct . nonetheless , if we consider the distribution of the approximated werner states , we observe that the values of fidelity increase , but the value of quantum discord of the target werner state @xmath64 is out of the limits of compatibility with the average quantum discord @xmath82 .",
    "this suggest that the second strategy employing the approximation to werner states reveals to be too drastic , as it does not account properly for the actual tomographic reconstruction of the density matrix .",
    "we can conclude that , even though high values of fidelity between a target state and a tomographic state are achieved , the properties of the two can be very different . on an extreme level",
    ", we can look at the distribution of the fidelity between the most classical states we generated , @xmath83 , and , at the opposite , the most entangled one as the target state , namely @xmath64 .",
    "the probability density histogram in fig .",
    "[ f : histogram ] shows that the two kind of states should result compatible with a level of fidelity @xmath84 , even though they possess clearly different properties .",
    "in conclusion , we have addressed quantum state reconstruction for dv and cv quantum optical systems and experimentally analyzed the significance of fidelity as a figure of merit to assess the properties of the reconstructed state .",
    "state reconstruction , in the two cases , has been performed adopting homodyne and mle tomography techniques .",
    "one of the most natural ways to link the tomographic results to the target states , i.e. the quantum states supposed to be generated by the designed experimental setup , is the evaluation of fidelity . in order to study the relation between fidelity and the experimental states , we performed statistical analysis using monte carlo sampling of each experiment , re - generating sets of @xmath48 data samples and analyzing the distribution of some of their main properties as a function of fidelity .    in the cv framework",
    ", we employed a thermal - state seeded opo cavity , an experimental configuration which allows to generate sts on - demand .",
    "the accurate control of the thermal and squeezing component of the apparatus , allows us to address the quantum - to - classical transition for these states .",
    "our results show that even for high values of fidelity and imposing energy constraints , one may find neighboring states in terms of fidelity which , however , not share the same quantum / classical properties .    in the dv context , we experimentally obtained pairs of polarized photons from type - i downconversion and conveniently generate the werner mixed states .",
    "this one - parameter family of states allowed us to analyze the non - classical properties of two - qubit states in terms of entanglement / separability and to evaluate the amount of quantum correlations by means of the quantum discord .",
    "we found that a fidelity based approximation of the tomographic states by werner states may lead to an overestimation e.g. of the quantum discord .",
    "moreover , high values of fidelity may occur between two very different states in terms of their separability properties .",
    "overall , we conclude that while fidelity is a good measure of geometrical proximity in the hilbert space it should not be used as the sole benchmark to certify quantum properties , which should be rather estimated tomographycally in a direct way .",
    "this work has been supported by unimi through the unimi14 grant 15 - 6 - 3008000 - 609 and the h2020 transition grant 15 - 6 - 3008000 - 625 , and by eu through the h2020 project quprocs ( grant agreement 641277 ) .",
    "in order to avoid the limitations of finite samples and the influence of systematic unpredictable errors that could be present in an experiment , we evaluate uncertainties by monte carlo resampling of data , according to standard metrological prescriptions @xcite valid for any statistical models having a single output quantity and input quantities with arbitrary distribution . here",
    "we provide a brief summary of the main assumptions and principles .",
    "the measured quantities of interest @xmath85 are random variables distributed according to a given probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath86 .",
    "in particular , we assume normal distributions characterized by mean value @xmath87 and standard deviation @xmath88 .",
    "monte carlo evaluation of uncertainties is based on sampling random outcomes from @xmath86 according to experimental data , which themselves fix the the average values and the standard deviations .",
    "in particular , as described in the main text , the considered experimental measurements , for cv systems , correspond to homodyne detection of the radiation field quadratures , whereas for dv systems we perform coincidence photon counting measurements of polarized photons . starting from experimental results ,",
    "we generate @xmath48 resampled replicas of the experiments , thus building a significative sample for the statistical analysis .",
