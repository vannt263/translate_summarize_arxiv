    "in euclidean space @xmath16 consider a reflector system consisting of a point source @xmath17 radiating with intensity @xmath18 in directions @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a closed set on a @xmath2dimensional unit sphere @xmath21 centered at @xmath17 , and a smooth perfectly reflecting hypersurface @xmath22 , star - shaped relative to @xmath17 , which intercepts and reflects the light rays with directions from @xmath20 ; see fig . [ fig . 1 ] . assuming the geometric optics approximation and applying the classical reflection law to determine the set of reflected directions @xmath23 ( after one reflection ) , we obtain an associated with @xmath22 `` reflector map '' @xmath24 . assuming that no energy is lost in the process , one can apply the energy conservation law to calculate the intensity distribution @xmath25 produced on @xmath26 .",
    "the reflector problem consists in solving the inverse problem in which the source @xmath17 , the sets @xmath27 and the intensities @xmath28 and @xmath29 are given in advance and the reflector @xmath22 needs to be determined .",
    "that is , @xmath22 should be such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 for all @xmath32 in the interior of @xmath20 ; here @xmath33 denotes the jacobian determinant of @xmath34    problems of this type arise often in applications , for example , in design of reflector antennas @xcite . in various forms",
    "the reflector problem has been considered by many authors and numerous papers by engineers ( at least since early 60-th @xcite until now @xcite ) are devoted to this subject .",
    "it was introduced in electrical engineering and optics independently of the mass transport problem .",
    "because of the strong nonlinear constraints appearing in the problem , progress has been slow and many theoretical and computational issues still remain open . the problem continues to attract considerable attention because of its practical importance and mathematical subtleties .",
    "it may be pointed out that a version of the reflector problem appears on the famous list of unsolved problems proposed by s.t .",
    "yau @xcite in 1993 .",
    "analytically , the reflector problem considered in this paper can be formulated as a nonlinear second order elliptic partial differential equation of monge - ampre type on a subset of @xmath35 . in such form",
    "it has been studied by v. oliker and p. waltman @xcite , l. caffarelli and v. oliker @xcite , x .-",

    "wang @xcite have shown that if the function @xmath28 ( resp .",
    "@xmath29 ) is treated as the density of a measure @xmath0 ( resp .",
    "@xmath1 ) that are absolutely continuous with respect to the volume measure on @xmath36 then the reflector problem can be studied as a variational problem in the framework of monge - kantorovich theory , that is , a problem of finding an optimal map minimizing the transport cost of transferring @xmath0 onto @xmath1 with the cost function @xmath37 .",
    "in contrast with other cost functions considered usually in the monge - kantorovich theory , this cost function may assume infinite values .",
    "consequently , in order to overcome this difficulty , a geometric condition requiring the supports of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be disjoint was imposed in @xcite and @xcite to establish existence and uniqueness of optimal maps . without imposing the condition that the supports of the measures are disjoint , existence and uniqueness of optimal maps was also obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , the proof is indirect as it relies on existence of weak solutions in the reflector problem established earlier in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the contribution of this study is twofold .",
    "first of all , we obtain existence and uniqueness of optimal maps @xmath10 for a class of cost functions that may be infinite .",
    "this class includes the logarithmic cost function of the reflector problem as a special case .",
    "the cost functions are precisely of the form @xmath4 where @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 is monotone .",
    "furthermore , we prove that @xmath38 which we view as an intermediary step in the study of the regularity of the map @xmath39 secondly , our approach is variational and direct ; the supports of measures @xmath0 and @xmath1 are allowed to overlap and it is merely required that these measures vanish on @xmath6rectifiable subsets .",
    "the precise statement can be found in theorem [ t1.5 ] .",
    "let us recall the main principles which ensure existence of optimal maps , which apparently , have been explicitly pointed out for the first time in @xcite and later exploited by many authors .",
    "assume we are given a cost function @xmath40 and two probability measures @xmath0 and @xmath1 on @xmath16 , say , absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "existence and uniqueness of an optimal map transporting @xmath0 onto @xmath1 against @xmath41 is ensured if @xmath42 is a one - to - one map of @xmath16 into itself .",
    "note that if @xmath43 then @xmath42 has this property .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that if instead , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are supported by @xmath35 , then existence of an optimal map transporting @xmath0 onto @xmath1 against @xmath43 , fails .",
    "one of the points in our study here is that we start with a cost function @xmath44 such that @xmath42 fails to be a one - to - one map of @xmath16 into itself .",
    "however , if @xmath45 and @xmath46 is distinct from the origin , we observed that there exists a unique @xmath47 satisfying the equation @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is the tangential gradient of @xmath41 on @xmath35 with respect to @xmath50 the injectivity of @xmath49 yields existence of an optimal map that transports @xmath0 onto @xmath1 , if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are supported by @xmath35 and vanish on @xmath6rectifiable sets .",
    "we use the kantorovich theory as a tool to give a transparent explanation to the existence of a unique solution in the reflector problem , under sharp assumptions .",
    "our main results are stated in theorem [ t1.5 ] .",
    "we refer the reader to a variant of the reflector problem involving two reflectors considered in a paper by t. glimm and v. oliker @xcite .",
    "we also refer the reader to a recent study by n. ahmad @xcite in the plane , motivated by @xcite .",
    "the paper is essentially self - contained .",
    "it is organized as follows . in order to motivate out subsequent considerations , we begin with a review of the reflector problem in section [ geom ] . in section [ mk ]",
    "we review and extend some results from the monge - kantorovich theory .",
    "our main results establishing existence and uniqueness of optimal maps are in section [ opt ] .",
    "let @xmath51 and @xmath22 be as in the introduction .",
    "if @xmath52 is the unit normal field on @xmath22 , then the incident direction @xmath32 and the reflected direction @xmath53 are related by the reflection law @xmath54 thus , the hypersurface @xmath22 defines the _ reflector _ map @xmath55 which maps the `` input aperture '' @xmath56 onto the `` output aperture '' @xmath23 ; see fig .",

    "one could also set it up on @xmath20 @xcite , but ( [ 1.2 ] ) is more convenient for our purposes here .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there exists a scalar quasi - potential @xmath61 from which the reflector @xmath22 can be recovered and in terms of which the equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) when @xmath62 is the following equation of monge - ampre type @xmath63|}{\\rho^n det(e)},\\ ; \\;\\ ; \\y \\in \\mbox{int}\\y , % \\label{1.3}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the standard metric on @xmath35 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are computed in the metric @xmath64 . in terms of @xmath67 the position vector of @xmath22 is given by @xmath68 while @xmath69 note that @xmath70 .",
    "a close examination of ( [ refl1 ] ) shows that it describes @xmath22 as an envelope of a family of paraboloids of revolution @xmath71 tangent to @xmath22 , parametrized by their axes @xmath72 and with common focus @xmath17 . for each @xmath73 @xmath74",

    "reflectors corresponding to negatively elliptic solutions of ( [ ma ] ) can be introduced and analyzed by similar methods @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the corresponding continuous function giving the focal parameters of all such supporting paraboloids @xmath86 , of @xmath22 is called the _ focal function _ and denoted by @xmath67 .",
    "the natural question of characterization of focal functions of closed convex reflectors was partially answered in @xcite .",
    "the * reflector map * ( possibly multivalued ) generalizing ( [ snell ] ) and denoted again by @xmath59 is defined for @xmath45 as @xmath87 it follows from ( [ polar1 ] ) and ( [ polar2 ] ) that , equivalently , the reflector map can be defined as @xmath88 the total amount of energy transferred from the source @xmath17 in a given set of directions @xmath89 is best described with the use of the map @xmath90 defined on any subset @xmath89 by setting @xmath91 it is shown in @xcite that for any borel subset @xmath89 the set @xmath92 is lebesgue measurable on @xmath35 .",
    "thus , if @xmath93 is the intensity of the source then the total amount of energy transferred by @xmath22 to the set @xmath89 is given by the `` energy '' function @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the standard @xmath96volume form on @xmath35 . it is assumed here and everywhere below that @xmath28 is extended from @xmath20 to the entire @xmath35 by setting @xmath97 .",

    "then there exists a reflector which is a weak solution of the reflector problem .",
    "the proof is obtained in two steps .",
    "first the problem is solved in the case when the right hand side in ( [ reqn ] ) is a finite sum of dirac masses . in this case a constructive minimization procedure together with an apriori two - sided @xmath108 estimate of @xmath109 is used to obtain the weak solution , which is also unique .",
    "the general problem is solved by approximating the right hand side in ( [ reqn ] ) by finite sums of dirac masses and obtaining the solution @xmath22 as a limit of a sequence of special solutions @xmath110 constructed on the previous step .",
    "the measures @xmath111 are weakly continuous and converge to @xmath112 . consequently , @xmath22 is indeed a weak solution of the reflector problem .",
    "the procedure we have just described proves , in fact , that the reflector problem admits a solution if the right hand side in ( [ reqn ] ) is any nonnegative probability measure on @xmath26 , possibly with a singular part .",
