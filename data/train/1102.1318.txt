    "ultracold gases of fermionic atoms and molecules have been the subject of a large number of experimental and theoretical studies@xcite in the last decade .",
    "the interest in these systems arises from the fact that the atoms or molecules obey quantum statistics rather than classical statistics and exhibit interesting and novel quantum phases at sufficiently low temperatures . unlike electron systems ,",
    "it is possible to manipulate the interaction between the atoms or molecules to some extent , e.g. , by feshbach resonances@xcite and/or by applying microwave fields.@xcite the ability to control the interactions can be used to gain insight into the physics of phase transitions and the nature of correlation effects in these quantum phases .",
    "celebrated examples are the experimental studies of the mott transition for bosons@xcite and of the superfluid pairing in the unitary ( strong - coupling ) fermi gas.@xcite finally , ultracold atomic gases may play an important role in future quantum computing devices .",
    "recently , interest has turned towards the use of ultracold atomic systems to investigate ferromagnetism in fermi gases .",
    "itinerant ferromagnetism in electron systems is poorly understood , and it is possible that insights might be gained by studying ferromagnetic fluid states in cold - atom systems.@xcite experimental studies of strongly repulsive fermi gases close to feshbach resonances have found behavior consistent with the formation of ( local ) ferromagnetic correlations in the manner of stoner ferromagnetism.@xcite however , these systems are limited by an intrinsic instability to molecule formation , which results in a short lifetime for the ferromagnetic state and may also complicate the interpretation of experimental features.@xcite it is therefore of interest to explore other forms of interaction that might give rise to ferromagnetism in the absence of nearby bound states .",
    "an interesting class of experimental system in this regard is provided by gases of fermionic polar molecules ( e.g. , @xmath1k@xmath2rb or @xmath3li@xmath1k ) .",
    "polar molecules that are confined to two - dimensional ( 2d ) layers and dressed by a circularly polarized microwave field experience a long - range potential that falls off as @xmath0 , where @xmath4 is the intermolecular distance.@xcite furthermore , the dressed states have the feature that there is a very sharp increase in the potential energy at short distances , preventing close approach . hence such molecules can be modeled as a gas of fermionic hard - core particles with an additional long - range potential varying as @xmath0 .",
    "the hard - core potential prevents the formation of shallow bound states even for ( weakly ) attractive long - range interactions .",
    "it has been suggested that a single - component gas of such fermionic molecules will exhibit a topological superfluid @xmath5-wave pairing phase , of direct relevance to possible topologically protected quantum computing devices.@xcite    here we consider the case of a two - component gas of such fermionic molecules .",
    "we have applied quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods to address the issue of whether or not the hard - core interactions cause this system to exhibit a region of itinerant ferromagnetism .",
    "in particular we have used the variational and diffusion quantum monte carlo ( vmc and dmc ) techniques@xcite to establish the ground - state phase diagram of two - component gases of fermionic hard - core particles moving in 2d .",
    "qmc methods are widely acknowledged to be the most accurate first - principles techniques available for studying condensed matter . in the vmc method ,",
    "monte carlo integration is used to evaluate expectation values with respect to an explicitly correlated many - body trial wave function . in the dmc method ,",
    "the ground - state component of a trial wave function is projected out by a stochastic algorithm .",
    "fermionic symmetry is maintained by the fixed - node approximation.@xcite    some of the earliest applications of qmc methods were to study the ground - state properties of bosonic hard - sphere fluids , as a model for the behavior of @xmath6he.@xcite more recently , qmc methods have been used to study 3d fermionic systems in which there is a hard - sphere repulsion between opposite - spin particles.@xcite to the best of our knowledge , however , qmc methods have never previously been used to study the phase diagram of 2d gases of fermionic hard - core particles    this paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",

    "the contribution to the local energy arising from this coordinate is @xmath60 the local energy diverges when hard - core particles approach one another , and the sign of the divergence depends on the positions of all the particles .",

    "physically , it is obvious that at high densities multi - body correlation effects will be important : motion is only possible if the particles move collectively .",

    "we extrapolate to infinite system size in each case , as shown in fig.[fig : fs_extrap_of_extra ] .     with respect to the non - reoptimized vmc wave function .",
    "[ fig : fs_extrap_of_extra ] ]      at @xmath83 a.u . , combining the vmc results for @xmath105 with the dmc energies in the absence of the additional interaction , we find that @xmath106 where @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 are the energies in a.u .  per particle for the paramagnetic fluid , ferromagnetic fluid , and ferromagnetic crystals , respectively , as a function of @xmath93 .",

    "the changes in the energies of the three phases due to the inclusion of the @xmath110 tail are very similar .",
    "as one would expect , a repulsive potential ( @xmath111 ) favors phases where the particles are kept apart ( i.e. , ferromagnetic over paramagnetic phases , and crystals over fluids ) , whereas an attractive interaction ( @xmath112 ) favors a paramagnetic fluid the most and a ferromagnetic crystal the least .",
    "there is no region of stability for the ferromagnetic fluid , although it comes close at @xmath113 .",
    "however , this is a regime where the interaction is strongly attractive , so that perturbation theory is no longer valid , and a trial wave function that includes the possibility of superfluid pairing is required for accurate qmc calculations .",
