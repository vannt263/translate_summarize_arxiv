    "trajectory interpretations of quantum mechanics have existed since the beginning of the quantum theory  even predating the  equation itself .",
    "indeed , one such approach survives today in the form of the jeffrey - wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( jwkb ) approximation , or more generally , semiclassical mechanics.@xcite in this approach , a time - evolving quantum wavepacket is treated as a statistical ensemble of classical trajectories that `` carry '' approximate quantum information , i.e. complex amplitudes . in the early 1950s ,",
    "hearkening back to the earlier pioneers , d. bohm and coworkers developed a conceptually similar trajectory interpretation of the _ exact _ quantum theory,@xcite introducing the so - called `` quantum potential '' to guide the resultant quantum trajectory dynamics . in the intervening years , quantum trajectory methods ( qtm)s have been used `` analytically''to provide insight into solved time - dependent quantum wavepacket propagation problems@xcite  and more recently , as a `` synthetic '' tool  to actually solve the time - dependent equation ( tdse ) itself.@xcite note that in this paper , `` qtm '' refers to the original quantum trajectory method based on standard bohmian mechanics , as developed by wyatt and coworkers,@xcite _ as well as _ the various offshoots and approximations that have developed in the intervening years .",
    "the standard bohmian formulation uses an amplitude - phase decomposition of the wavefunction , @xmath3 , which in one dimension ( 1d ) takes the form ( x , t ) = r(x , t ) e^i s(x , t)/. [ onelm ] this representation has been called `` unipolar,''@xcite because the field functions , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are single - valued at all positions , @xmath6 , and times , @xmath7 . the field functions , and the resultant quantum trajectories , are generally smooth and classical - like  provided the true potential , @xmath8 , is slowly - varying , _ and _ @xmath9 exhibits no interference .",
    "however , interference introduces non - classical - like oscillations in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which in turn lead to severe numerical difficulties for qtm calculations  collectively referred to as `` the node problem.''@xcite despite substantial progress,@xcite the node problem continues to be the most formidable roadblock impeding the progress of qtm s as a general and robust tool for exact quantum scattering applications .    as a promising remedy to the node problem ,",
    "this paper is the fifth in a series@xcite exploring the use of _ bipolar _ decompositions of the wavefunction , i.e. = + , [ psitot ] such that the quantum trajectories associated with the bipolar wavefunction components , @xmath10 , are well - behaved and classical - like , even when the unipolar quantum trajectories associated with @xmath9 itself are not ",
    "e.g . , when @xmath9 exhibits interference .",
    "in fact , by generalizing bohmian mechanics for multipolar decompositions such as above , it becomes possible to achieve _",
    "classical correspondence_i.e . , trajectories and field functions that approach their classical counterparts in the classical limit of large mass , energy , and/or action  which is not in general possible for any unipolar bohmian treatment .",
    "most qtm papers found in the literature concern themselves with time - dependent localized wavepacket dynamics , as indeed , is also true of this fifth paper in the bipolar series .",
    "however , this paper represents a stark departure from the previous four , all of which pertain to stationary solutions of the the time-_independent _  equation  albeit obtained in a pseudo - time - dependent manner using delocalized counter - propagating wave components . for 1d stationary states ,",
    "the two @xmath10 components correspond to approximate semiclassical analogs,@xcite of which there are always two at every classically - allowed point in space and time  thus justifying a bipolar qtm treatment in this context .",
    "if there are classical turning points demarcating classically allowed and forbidden regions , these are known _ a priori _ , and do not change over time .",
    "in contrast , the semiclassical treatment of localized _ wavepacket _ dynamics , even in 1d , is considerably more complicated than for stationary states  rendering it far more difficult to arrive at a suitable qtm analog .",
    "in particular , the time - evolving semiclassical field functions can become multivalued over regions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in a highly non - trivial way , due to caustics that form , move , and then disappear over time.@xcite the appropriate number of semiclassical components can become one , two , or even three or more , and in any case , varies nontrivially over @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the formation of caustics , in turn , is due to the crossing of neighboring classical trajectories belonging to a semiclassical wavepacket ensemble .",
    "in stark contrast are quantum trajectories , which , for a single component , may _ never _ cross  implying single - valuedness for all @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and evidently greatly complicating the task of achieving classical correspondence .",
    "let us imagine , for instance , that at the initial time , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is taken to be of the unipolar form .",
    "though initially single - valued , @xmath9 may , at later @xmath7 , become multivalued over certain regions of @xmath6 , under a semiclassical treatment .",
    "however , since an ensemble of _ quantum _ trajectories does not develop caustics , how then is a qtm to become similarly multivalued ?",
    "this fundamental difficulty persists even under the usual allowance that quantum and semiclassical wavefunctions are equivalent only to @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , it raises the following , purely semiclassical conundrum , which to the author s best knowledge , has not been previously addressed : if @xmath9 can become multivalued at _ later _",
    "@xmath7 , why should it never be considered so at @xmath14 ?",
    "one practical reason is that the @xmath13 uniqueness of the semiclassical representation would be compromised , making it unclear how to proceed .",
    "this answer is not satisfying in any formal sense ; yet indeed , semiclassical theory treats the same gaussian wavefunction as _ single - valued _ if interpreted in a wavepacket context , or _",
    "double - valued _ if regarded as a harmonic oscillator ground state .    with regard to qtm wavepacket dynamics ,",
    "the multivalued problem described above can in principle be addressed in a variety of ways .",
    "one simple strategy would be to actually use classical trajectories for the dynamics  not approximately , as in semiclassical theories , but rather , with _",
    "exact _ propagation of the ( complex - valued ) quantum amplitudes , @xmath4 .",
    "this approach can be regarded as an arbitrary lagrangian - eulerian ( ale ) method,@xcite modified to allow for the formation of caustics and multivalued fields .",
    "note that probability is no longer conserved along trajectories  and indeed , must approach zero at the caustics , in order to avoid infinite probability density . in practice , this condition itself causes numerical instabilities , and in any case would be unfeasible to implement for large systems.@xcite    alternatively  and seemingly contrary to semiclassical behavior ",
    "one might opt to adhere strictly to a globally bipolar decomposition of the form , in order to facilitate comparison with the bipolar stationary state theories of papers i  iv in the series.@xcite even in this relatively restricted context , however , the `` correct '' bipolar wavepacket generalization is not necessarily obvious . in the previous work , for instance , both of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 field functions",
    "are symmetric for stationary bound states,@xcite whereas only @xmath17 is symmetric [ i.e. , @xmath18 for the more general case of stationary scattering states.@xcite for bipolar wavepacket dynamics , _ neither _ field function provides us with simplifying symmetry ; moreover , we evidently have no direct recourse to semiclassical mechanics , which was previously relied upon as a guide .",
    "one way to state the problem is as follows : a complete specification of the bipolar wavepacket dynamics generally requires _ four _ independent real - valued time - evolution equations .",
    "two of these are automatically provided by the tdse , but how are the remaining two to be chosen ?",
    "one promising avenue , which we have explored considerably,@xcite is to adopt the combined flux continuity condition@xcite [ ] as the third equation .",
    "in fact , if _ imaginary _ flux is considered,@xcite the fourth and final equation can also be obtained .",
    "unfortunately , these equations do not provide satisfactory results , in that over time , the individual @xmath10 components themselves develop interference oscillations and nodes  thus defeating the purpose of a bipolar expansion .",
    "more flexibility can be obtained by dropping the imaginary flux continuity condition , but to date , all such efforts have also been unsuccessful@xcite  either due to @xmath10 interference , or other equally unsatisfactory behaviors ( sec .",
    "[ additional ] ) .",
    "ultimately , the most successful bipolar wavepacket generalization scheme we have considered has also proven to be one of the most conceptually straightforward ",
    "i.e . , to expand @xmath9 as a superposition of stationary state solutions , whose @xmath19 and @xmath20 components are then used to determine the wavepacket @xmath10 via linear superposition .",
    "the idea is simple , but the theoretical development is somewhat involved . in any event ,",
    "this approach , which will serve as the focus of this paper , leads to a node - free , and otherwise remarkably well - behaved decomposition  and",
    "moreover , turns out to satisfy classical correspondence after all .",
    "it also leads to time - evolution equations that are practicable for numerical implementation .",
    "note that bipolar quantum trajectory formulations for the tdse have been considered previously by other authors,@xcite albeit not in a manner designed to solve the interference / node problem .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "consider the two bipolar components , @xmath21 , associated with a 1d stationary scattering state solution of the  equation , @xmath22 , with energy , @xmath23 , and left - incident boundary conditions .",
    "the solution components , @xmath21 , are exact quantum analogs of a type of semiclassical jwkb approximation resulting from the `` generalized frman '' approach.@xcite note that for the remainder of this paper , @xmath24 is used in the context of stationary state wavefunctions , whereas @xmath3 is reserved for localized wavepacket dynamics .",
    "the solution components @xmath21 behave as ( right / left ) traveling plane waves in both asymptotes . as @xmath6 sweeps through the potential interaction region ,",
    "the solution component @xmath25 varies smoothly from incident to transmitted wave , whereas @xmath26 varies smoothly from reflected wave to zero .    in several previous articles,@xcite",
    "an extremely accurate , efficient , and robust 1d numerical algorithm was developed for computing @xmath21 , and thus @xmath27 .",
    "the algorithm is a time - dependent relaxation method , for which the initial @xmath28 is a plane wave . over time , a reflected wave , @xmath29 , comes into being through interaction region coupling due to the potential energy , and eventually , @xmath30 relaxes to the true stationary scattering solution .    from ref .",
    "( 12 ) , the @xmath31 time - evolution equations are =  + i - i v [ fdot ] , where primes denote spatial differentiation , @xmath32 is the mass , @xmath33 is the magnitude of the asymptotic momentum , and asymptotically symmetric potentials are presumed [ @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "the initial value conditions are given by where @xmath36 is the initial time .",
    "at the left and right coordinate limits , i.e. @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , the boundary conditions are :    in general , does _ not _ satisfy the tdse , in that @xmath39 for all times @xmath7 , where @xmath40 is the usual equation hamiltonian .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of this approach as a `` revelatory '' or `` relaxation '' method,@xcite but implies that itself can not be used as a basis for deriving wavepacket time - evolution equations , for which the tdse must be satisfied at all @xmath7 .",
    "we therefore consider the asymptotically large time limit , @xmath41 , in which not only satisfies the tdse , but relaxes to the exact stationary solution , so that = -i e = -i e .

    "second , what constitutes the coupling contribution ( i.e. the last term ) in is _ not _ equivalent to that of .",
    "most strikingly , the latter coupling is proportional to @xmath46 rather than to @xmath47 itself .",
    "this implies that the coupling vanishes in both of the coordinate asymptotic limits , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , _ even _ when @xmath8 is not taken to be asymptotically symmetric .",
    "this represents quite an improvement over , which can not be applied to asymmetric potentials because there is asymptotic coupling in at least one coordinate limit.@xcite although can be used with asymptotically asymmetric potentials , there are nontrivial ramifications for wavepacket dynamics ( sec .  [ asymmetric ] ) .",
    "the final , and perhaps most important , observation that will be made regarding the coupling contribution to is that it is _ directly proportional to the jwkb quantity denoting the classical limit_i.e .",

    "classical correspondence is established for the new time - evolution equations .",
    "all of the above still refers to delocalized left - incident stationary scattering states @xmath55 , at definite energies @xmath23 . for every positive @xmath23 value ,",
    "the methodology uniquely determines a corresponding @xmath55 and @xmath54 . in generalizing for ( left - incident ) localized wavepacket dynamics",
    ", an eminently sensible strategy is to decompose the wavepacket @xmath3 as an orthonormal expansion in the stationary states @xmath55an expansion which , in turn , is applied to the @xmath54 components themselves , to uniquely determine @xmath56 and the bipolar decomposition .",

    "consequently , we apply the expansion to both sides of , in order to directly derive time - evolution equations for @xmath10 .",

    "in general , a great range of behaviors are possible for nonstationary state dynamics in 1d , many of which are undesirable .",
    "we therefore first stipulate that  apart from exhibiting interference@xmath9 itself be well - behaved . by this",
    "we mean that @xmath9 is normalized to unity and well - localized at all times @xmath7 , consisting of a single left - incident wavepacket at the initial time @xmath14 , and of well - separated left- and right - moving reflected and transmitted branches , respectively , at the final time @xmath66 . under these assumptions for the @xmath9 wavepacket dynamics ,",

    "* _ condition 2 : _ well - localized @xmath10 and @xmath68 at all @xmath7 . * _ condition 3 : _ node - free components , @xmath10 , at all @xmath7 .",
    "condition 1 .",
    "means that the initial left - incident wavepacket consists solely of @xmath15i.e .",
    ", @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "it also means that at the asymptotically large final time @xmath67 , @xmath71 becomes the right - moving transmitted branch of @xmath72 , and @xmath73 becomes the left - moving reflected branch .",
    "condition 2 .",
    "is straightforward , and absolutely essential , e.g. , for multidimensional generalizations .",
    "condition 3 .",
    "is expected to hold at _ all _ @xmath7particularly intermediate times , where @xmath9 itself may exhibit substantial interference and/or nodes .    for the remainder of this subsection ,",
    "asymptotically symmetric potentials are presumed , as defined in sec .  [ background ] .",
    "at the initial time @xmath11 , the incident wavepacket is localized far to the left of the potential interaction region , so that @xmath8 is effectively zero , and the plane wave boundary condition accurately describes @xmath74over the whole asymptotic region where @xmath75 is significant .",
    "thus , the initial stationary state expansion is essentially _ identical to a fourier expansion_or equivalently , the momentum - space representation , @xmath76 . through the identification @xmath77 , we find that only the @xmath78 states contribute in the expansion for @xmath79 ; the @xmath80 states give rise to a left - moving contribution , which is presumed to be zero at @xmath14 .",
    "condition 1 .",
    "thus requires that the negative momentum contribution to @xmath81 be vanishingly small , i.e. _",
    "-^0 |^0(p)|^2 dp 0 .",
    "[ pcon ] this is a very reasonable requirement to impose on @xmath81 , for it implies that the initial wavepacket is completely incident upon the scattering potential center .    at the final time @xmath67 ,",
    "the @xmath82 expansion coefficients from are identical to their initial values at @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the reflected and transmitted wavepacket branches are localized far to the left and right , respectively , of the interaction region , so that once again , the @xmath30 are effectively plane waves.@xcite however , these asymptotic plane waves are no longer characterized by the standard unit normalization of , but must instead be weighted by the @xmath23-dependent reflection and transmission amplitudes , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , when determining the fourier components , @xmath85 . note that since @xmath86 [ ] , there can be no @xmath16 component in the right asymptote , implying that the right - moving transmitted branch at @xmath67 must consist only of a @xmath87 contribution .",
    "similar arguments can be used to demonstrate that the left - moving reflected branch at @xmath67 must consist only of @xmath88 .",
    "we thus find that condition 1 .",
    "above is formally satisfied at both @xmath11 and @xmath67 .",
    "regarding condition 2 .",
    ", here again we make use of . if were _ not _ satisfied , then @xmath89 would in general be nonzero . since @xmath90 [ from ]",

    "thus , @xmath92 would be _",

    "conversely to the above scenario , the fact that is true implies that @xmath68 , and therefore @xmath10 , are localized  not _ only _ at asymptotic times , but at _ all _ times .",
    "thus , condition 2 .",
    "is also formally satisfied .    in practice , is never perfectly satisfied ( even in the @xmath93 limit ) , but is only approximately correct , to some desired level of numerical accuracy .",

    "one very interesting and unexpected feature is the small spur formed on the left side of @xmath223 at intermediate times .",
    "this spur remains behind the main @xmath15 peak , staying in place above the growing @xmath16 wavepacket during stage 1 . , and then moving `` backwards '' with @xmath16 during stage 2 ( as is more evident in calculations for parameters other than those used in sec .",
    "[ eckartproton ] ) . at a certain point in time , either before or after the start of stage 2 . , the spur starts to diminish in size , and eventually dissipates completely . from fig .",
    "[ eckartprotonfig ] , the role of the spur is clear ",
    ", to bring about interference in the left , or `` reflected , '' part of @xmath9 , at intermediate times .",
    "it is well - known that the `` reflected '' part of @xmath9 exhibits nodes and interference to a far greater extent than the transmitted part  indeed , one common strategy in traditional unipolar qtm calculations is to ignore the reflected part altogether , after a certain point in time.@xcite to some extent , the observed interference in @xmath9 is due to the the incident / transmitted and reflected contributions .",
    "however , this can not be the whole of the story , for the incident / transmitted contribution [ main @xmath223 peak ] often passes by , long before the interference goes away completely .",
    "indeed , the so - called `` node healing '' process may continue even _ after _ @xmath224 has started to move away from the interaction region .",
    "eventually though , the nodes will be healed completely  leading to a smooth final @xmath134 reflected branch , and causing the @xmath223 spur to vanish from existence .",
    "it would thus appear natural to interpret the above as the result of not two , but _",
    "three _ separate contributions , as considered briefly in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , each of which is smooth and well - behaved at all times . in particular , the @xmath224 component is the reflected contribution , the main peak of @xmath223 is the incident / transmitted contribution , and the @xmath223 spur  non - zero only at intermediate times  is the third contribution .",
    "there are thus two distinct types of interference : type i , between incident / transmitted and reflected contributions , and type ii , between spur and reflected contributions .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the decomposition should be generally capable of smoothly disentangling such varied and complex interference patterns  a very delicate balance is evidently required  yet this appears to be the case .    in fig .",
    "[ eckartprotonfig](c ) , for instance , one can discern interference in the @xmath229 plot far to the left of the interaction region , where @xmath230 itself appears to be vanishingly small .",
    "yet this tiny @xmath231 contribution is very significant , for without it , @xmath229 would equal @xmath232 , which by visual inspection is clearly false .",
    "there is thus a pronounced sensitivity in any bipolar decomposition  owing ultimately to the square - root relation between @xmath3 and @xmath233which in practice , renders it exceedingly difficult to completely disentangle interference effects .",
    "returning to the idea of a _",
    "decomposition , we comment that further justification for this interpretation can be provided using semiclassical arguments.@xcite in particular , consider an eckart barrier scattering problem for which the initial gaussian wavepacket is _ spreading _ ( dispersing ) at the initial time @xmath11 [ unlike ] .",
    "this stipulation is necessary in order that the classical trajectories of the ensemble follow different orbits , so that partial transmission and reflection can be achieved in a semiclassical context .",
    "figure  [ classicalfig ] represents the time - evolution of such a classical trajectory ensemble , or `` lagrangian manifold '' ( lm),@xcite in phase space .",
    "the semiclassical lm , though initially single - valued , develops caustics over time , rendering it multivalued at later times .",
    "in particular , one caustic ( labeled `` a '' in fig .  [ classicalfig ] ) forms on the left of the barrier peak , essentially sweeping through all of the individual trajectory turning points , for those classical trajectories with insufficient energy to clear the barrier .",
    "for a fairly narrow initial momentum distribution , this caustic will not move very much in @xmath6-space , over time . at a given time , those trajectories that have moved through caustic a constitute the reflected branch of the wavepacket , whereas those that have not comprise the incident / transmitted wavepacket . in any event ,",
    "caustic a is responsible for type i interference .",
    "let us assume that the leading trajectories of the ensemble have sufficient energy to clear the barrier  thus giving rise to the transmitted branch of the lm at sufficiently large times . since the lm must be simply connected , there must be a _",
    "second _ caustic to the left of caustic a ( labeled `` b '' ) , which allows the lm to double back through the interaction region and connect with the transmitted branch , as indicated in the figure .",
    "caustic b represents the leading edge of the reflected wavepacket , and as such , continually moves to the left . over time , the connecting thread between b and the transmitted branch gets pulled apart by the separatrix `` like taffy , '' so that the integrated thread probability becomes vanishingly small .",
    "the connecting thread itself therefore corresponds to the @xmath15 spur , giving rise to type ii interference , and a _ tripolar _ lm representation in the `` reflected '' part of @xmath9 .",
    "the present bipolar approach thus achieves classical correspondence in the classical limit .",
    "in addition  as also observed previously in the bipolar treatment of stationary states@xcite  it also leads to smooth , classical - like behavior far from the classical limit .",

    "in fact , @xmath275 does not appear to exhibit any interference at all , even though the @xmath269 components do overlap slightly at intermediate times , which could in principle lead to type i interference .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath269 are both growing in place , and therefore have the same mean velocity of zero , whereas @xmath271 is moving relative to @xmath272 .",
    "this situation , though easily understood within the present bipolar picture , would perhaps be difficult to justify in purely semiclassical lm terms .",
    "this paper represents a turning point in the development of the bipolar qtm methodology .",
    "all of the previous papers in the series have focused exclusively on stationary states  whether bound or scattering states , for either continuous or discontinuous potentials .",
    "this was a necessary prerequisite for the present paper , in addition to being useful in its own right  i.e .",
    ", leading to the development of extremely efficient and robust algorithms for 1d stationary scattering applications ( ref .   and ref .  ) .",
    "these algorithms have been succesfully applied to challenging deep tunneling applications , and also to 1d reaction path hamiltonian approximations for real chemical reactions such as cl@xmath276 + ch@xmath277cl @xmath278 clch@xmath277 + cl@xmath276 . on the other hand , the direct calculation of the stationary @xmath279 states , as functions of position",
    ", will never be feasible for very large systems , owing to the fact that such states are delocalized over a configuration space of many dimensions .",
    "if such systems are to succumb to exact quantum dynamical treatment in a position - space representation , it must be via some non - stationary , localized wavepacket approach .",
    "moreover , the dynamical equations used for the numerical wavepacket propagation must be free of any explicit dependence on the @xmath279 states , or even @xmath23 itself .",
    "this we have achieved here in through a sequence of manipulations of the original time - evolution equations for stationary scattering states [ ] , and the introduction of reasonable restrictions on the allowed wavepacket dynamics ( sec .  [ additional ] ) .",
    "the intermediate result , , though not used directly , depends on the jwkb quantity ( sec .",
    "[ evolution])thereby affording a theoretical connection with semiclassical mechanics and the classical limit .",
    "the final is an integro - differential equation that depends on the spatial _ integral _ of @xmath56 , rather than the integral of @xmath280 , or @xmath56 itself .",
    "this is quite unusual in the context of quantum dynamics ",
    "though commonplace , for instance , in soliton dynamics.@xcite in any case , it is precisely this spatial integration that removes all explicit dependence of on @xmath23 and @xmath60the crucial requirement in the derivation of .",
    "the derivation is more involved than originally anticipated , owing to the fact that is presented in a form that is unsuitable for a wavepacket generalization  even though ultimately , is derived from , and is thus equivalent to it ( at least at asymptotically large times ) .",
    "nevertheless , there are essential differences between the two equations , stemming from the fact that the coupling contribution in is not the same as in",
    ". one important difference is that is independent of the constant potential value , @xmath208 , used to define the stationary state trajectories ( though the @xmath208 value does affect the initial value conditions ) .",
    "also , the tdse is satisfied at all times ( not just asymptotically large times ) . finally , unlike",
    ", does not conserve total integrated probability [ ] .",
    "another important new development is that the bipolar wavepacket methodology readily lends itself to a traditional bohmian mechanics interpretation  e.g .",
    ", quantum trajectories defined via @xmath281 [ ] , with dynamics governed by the quantum potential . the behavior of the bipolar quantum trajectories ensuing from will be explored in a future publication . in practical terms , however , the trajectories are essentially guaranteed to be well - behaved , provided that all three of the conditions for well - behaved bipolar wavepacket components , as described in sec .",
    "[ additional ] , are satisfied for all @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "condition 3 .",
    ", in particular , is required to circumvent the node problem plaguing the synthetic qtm approach , and is therefore essential for application to large systems , for which the eulerian fixed - grid algorithm used here ( however efficiently implemented ) would be unfeasible .    to satisfy all three conditions of sec .",
    "[ additional ] for a wide variety of applications is decidedly nontrivial , and quite a lot to ask of any set of dynamical equations  especially with regard to the interference condition 3 . , owing to the square - root sensitivity discussed in sec .",
    "indeed , it may be the case that _ no _ set of evolution equations other than would be capable of achieving such a separation for general applications .",
    "in fact , a great many candidates were explored and rejected , for failing to satisfy condition . 3 ( and in many cases , conditions 1 . and 2 . as well).@xcite the examples of sec .",
    "[ results ] ( and others ) nevertheless indicate that the present bipolar wavepacket approach appears capable of achieving this  in both the quantum and classical limits , and even when there is a complicated interplay of at least two different types of interference .",
    "these examples also clearly demonstrate that virtually all quantum effects that play a role in wavepacket dynamics ",
    "i.e . dispersion , tunneling , and interference  can be easily incorporated .",
    "note that for real molecular systems with atomic nuclei heavier than hydrogen , interference effects can be even more pronounced than for any of the examples considered in this paper ; such cases will be considered in future publications .",
    "the present work thus serves to demonstrate that a synthetic bipolar wavepacket qtm approach based on would be widely applicable and numerically feasible  using the quantum potential to handle those quantum effects that it does best , i.e. dispersion and tunneling , and intercomponent coupling to treat interference .",
    "the numerical algorithm would employ well - established unstructured grid techniques , such as local least - squares fitting,@xcite that have already been applied successfully to standard unipolar wavepacket qtm applications _ without _ interference . in the unipolar context , the chief numerical requirement is the calculation of spatial derivatives needed to compute the quantum potential or quantum force . the only new numerical requirement for the bipolar treatment is that of spatial _ integration _",
    ", to evaluate @xmath68 at every time step .",
    "this is not anticipated to pose severe numerical difficulties , even for multidimensional applications , as the generalization of is a _ line _ integral ( 1d ) , rather than a volume integral over all degrees of freedom .    as a practical matter , it is important that the present approach can be generalized for arbitrary asymmetric potentials , and even multisurface applications , as discussed in secs .",
    "[ asymmetric ] and  [ multisurf ] , respectively .",
    "intriguingly the time - evolution equations for the former are unmodified from the symmetric case , although the initial and final value conditions do depend on the asymptotic potential values . from a formal perspective",
    ", the fact that multiple calculations must be performed in the asymmetric case  and then `` glued '' together discontinuously at the dividing point , @xmath123is perhaps less appealing than the continuous @xmath282 approach developed for stationary state applications in ref .  .",
    "on the other hand , the discontinuous approach is also taken by other standard `` dividing surface '' reactive scattering methods , which essentially posit two completely different asymptotic hamiltonians , one for reactants , and one for products.@xcite in any event , a generalization of the bipolar wavepacket theory using step effective potentials @xmath283 directly ( ref .  ) , will be explored in a future paper .",
    "this will allow direct propagation across the discontinuity , which in turn , implies that only a single calculation need be performed for asymptotically asymmetric systems , while still satisfying perfect asymptotic separation .",
    "another issue that may be considered in future is the generalization for initial wavepackets that do _ not _ satisfy i.e .",
    ", that include an initially outgoing contribution .",
    "the nominal difficulty is that such wavepackets lead to delocalized @xmath1 functions , although this issue may be resolved by explicit consideration of the _ right_-incident stationary solutions .",
    "in addition to the various `` horizontal '' developments , to be considered in future publications as described above , the next step in the `` vertical '' or methodological direction  and the subject of the final paper in this series  remains the development of a _ multidimensional _ generalization . in a sense , already provides one avenue for multidimensional application  in that the multiple surfaces may be regarded as parametrized , discrete quantum states for all of the `` perpendicular '' degrees of freedom .",
    "this approach could be used , for instance , to treat rotational degrees of freedom in the context of a partial wave expansion . in paper",
    "vi though , we shall address wavepacket dynamics directly on the full - dimensional configuration space . the theoretical development required",
    "will be seen to be a remarkably straightforward generalization of that presented here . in particular , only _ two _ wavefunction components are still required  regardless of system dimensionality  provided there is a single reaction path .",
    "moreover , the formalism can accommodate standard jacobi - type coordinate representations with arbitrary curvilinear reaction paths .",
    "paper  vi will present results for several multidimensional applications including collinear h+h@xmath284the first such exact quantum dynamics calculations ever performed using a qtm .",
    "moreover , the resultant multidimensional @xmath56 decomposition will be found to satisfy the three all - important conditions of sec .",
    "[ additional ] .    as a final observation",
    ", we note that the bipolar wavepacket decomposition as presented in this paper is by no means restricted to the bohmian mechanics context only .",
    "more generally , it ought to be regarded as a scattering formalism in its own right , which could in principle impact favorably on any of a number of existing computational methodologies .",
    "even straightforward eulerian fixed - grid propagations , for instance , might benefit from the greatly increased grid spacing and time step sizes associated with the component @xmath10s  which are much smoother in general than @xmath9 itself , particularly in the classical limit .",
    "another idea might be to exploit the gaussian - like properties of the component @xmath10 s to develop an approximate gaussian evolution scheme ,  la heller.@xcite perhaps as few as three such `` growing gaussians '' would be required ",
