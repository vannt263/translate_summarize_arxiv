    "many properties of the electronic condensate in a macroscopic quantum system can be unveiled by rotating it and studying the structure of the induced quantized vortices.@xcite in particular , the amount of magnetic flux carried by cooper - pair vortices in bulk conventional superconductors determines whether the material is of type i or type ii.@xcite in the first case , vortices tend to merge into large flux domains carrying many flux quanta .",
    "conversely , for the type - ii material , vortices are singly quantized and repel each other , tending to arrange themselves into a triangular lattice .",
    "some superconductors , however , are provided with two or more electronic condensates arising from cooper pairing in different bands of the material .",
    "these multiband systems have attracted much interest in the last decade because : ( i ) most of the recently discovered superconducting materials , such as mgb@xmath2 and compounds of the iron - pnictide family , are recognized as multiband superconductors ; and ( ii ) they exhibit a variety of new and interesting phenomena with no counterpart in conventional single - component superconductors .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing of these phenomena are related to the exotic vortex structures that can emerge in a multicomponent superconductor .    in the bulk",
    ", a multicomponent vortex can exist in equilibrium only in a so - called composite state where vortices in the different condensates share the same core.@xcite however , because of the different length scales @xmath3 at which the cooper - pair density varies in each component,@xcite the interaction between such composite vortices can be non - monotonic : short - range repulsive with an attractive tail.@xcite this ultimately leads to vortex clustering at low magnetic fields and , thereby , to the formation of a semi - meissner state , that is , a mixture of flux - free and vortex - cluster regions coexisting in equilibrium .",
    "this phase was predicted by babaev and speight@xcite and experimentally observed by moshchalkov _",
    "et al._@xcite in an ultraclean mgb@xmath2 single crystal . in this case",
    ", the first critical field corresponds to the thermodynamic stabilization of a vortex cluster in the sample , rather than a single vortex . in this regime , besides clusters , other exotic configurations are likely , such as vortex rings , giant - multi vortex groupings , and other unusual patterns.@xcite    actually , the competing interactions in a multiband material can lead to even more unconventional vortex topologies .",
    "for instance , `` unmatched '' composite vortices , that is , with both condensates having different phase winding numbers , can exist out of equilibrium.@xcite such vortices enclose arbitrary magnetic flux , in contrast to quantized abrikosov vortices in conventional superconductors .",
    "another example are noncomposite vortices , in which the phase singularities in each condensate are displaced from one another",
    ". these vortices also carry arbitrary flux , however , since their energy increases prohibitively with sample size , they can only be observed in small samples .",
    "these exotic vortex structures could be used as a hallmark of multiband superconductivity .",
    "therefore , an important question is how to stabilize and detect such fractional vortices .",
    "recently , chibotaru and co - workers@xcite have proposed that fractional vortices can be realized and even thermodynamically stabilized in a two - band mesocopic disk .",
    "subsequently , geurts _ et al._@xcite extended the analysis by including magnetic coupling , besides the interband josephson coupling used in previous works .",
    "all these studies were performed within the two - component ginzburg - landau ( tcgl ) formalism , taking phenomenological constants as parameters of the simulations .",
    "however as recently observed in ref .  , the phenomenological constants of the tcgl model can not be chosen freely because they are coupled by microscopic material parameters , such as electron - phonon coupling constants , fermi velocities and partial density of states . a more systematic study of the stability of composite and non - composite vortex states in mesoscopic two - component superconductors , within the correct microscopic framework , is still pending .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the stability regions of fractional flux vortices in a two - band mesoscopic superconductor in a parameter space defined by microscopic material parameters .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate how the stability of these states can be considerably enhanced by the presence of a closeby magnetic dot with a suitable magnetization .",
    "we consider a mesoscopic two - band superconducting disk of thickness @xmath4 much smaller than the penetration depth @xmath5 and the two characteristic lengths of density variations in both condensates , in such a way that the system is effectively two - dimensional .",
    "our calculations rely on the minimal two - component ginzburg - landau ( tcgl ) model , where the only coupling appearing explicitly in the free - energy functional is josephson - like.@xcite within this framework , the total free energy can be written as the sum of the free energies of the otherwise isolated bands and the josephson coupling free energy , that is , @xmath6 - \\gamma\\left(\\psi_1\\psi_2^ * + \\psi_1^*\\psi_2\\right)\\!\\bigg\\ }   \\label{eq.freeenergy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath7 is the band label and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are parameters derivable from the microscopic theory . the last term accounts for magnetic coupling between the bands , where @xmath12 is the applied magnetic field , and @xmath13 is the local ( total ) field . however , because of the small thickness and lateral size of the system under investigation , screening effects are negligible and thereby so is the magnetic coupling between the bands .    within the two - band eilenberger formalism,@xcite",
    "the relevant microscopic parameters are the fermi velocities @xmath14 , the partial densities of states @xmath15 , and the elements of the electron - phonon coupling matrix @xmath16 the critical temperature is given by the relation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the debye frequency and @xmath19 are the roots of the linear system of self - consistecy equations for the gaps .",
    "the correct value of @xmath20 is given by the smallest root .",
    "it is also convenient to define the following auxiliary parameters : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and the positive constants @xmath24    in terms of the microscopic parameters above , the tcgl coefficients can be expressed as : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . as usual",
    ", one can define the healing lengths @xmath29 , which are related to the characteristic lengths of density variations of order parameters 1 and 2 ( see for instance ref .  ) . however , the real healing lengths of the condensates have to be calculated , and are strongly influenced by the critical temperatures of the otherwise uncoupled bands@xcite ( that is , the temperature at which the corresponding @xmath9 changes sign ) , @xmath30 notice that both @xmath31 are always smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath32 , both @xmath9 are positive and superconductivity survives in the system only due to coupling between the bands , whereas for @xmath33 , both bands are active ( @xmath34 ) . for temperatures such that @xmath35 , one of the bands ( band a ) is active while the other ( band p ) is passive , that is , it remains superconducting only because of cooper pairs coming from band a.    finally",
    ", minimization of the tcgl free energy  [ eq.freeenergy ] leads to the following dimensionless gl equations :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 . here , we adopted the following temperature independent units : @xmath20 for temperatures , @xmath38 for both order parameters , @xmath39 for distances , and @xmath40 for the vector potential",
    ". hereafter , we choose the disk radius @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the effective penetration depth , so that screening and demagnetizing effects can be neglected .",
    "accordingly , the vector potential in ( [ eq.tcgl ] ) can be well approximated by that corresponding to the external magnetic field .",
    "the minimal tcgl model with the @xmath43 approximation is in principle strictly valid only in the immediate vicinity of @xmath20 , in which case the model is reduced to the conventional gl theory featuring a single order parameter with a single length scale.@xcite however , for lower temperatures the correct microscopic scenario points to two condensates with two _ a priori _ different healing lengths .",
    "inspired by the success of the gl formalism in producing correct results well out of its strict validity range in several other instances , one may ask whether the applicability range of the tcgl model can be pushed to lower temperatures . indeed , in ref .",
    "it was shown that an extension of the gl theory to include complete @xmath44 terms to the expansion of the order parameters pushes the validity of the theory to temperatures as low as @xmath45 , depending on the values of the microscopic parameters .",
    "in addition , this model correctly predicts two different density length scales , which become equal only for @xmath46 , thus in reconciliation with previous results from the microscopic theory .",
    "unfortunately , the extended gl model for the non - zero field case is to date available only for the single - band superconductors.@xcite    recently , evidences that the standard tcgl model provides a correct description of two - band superconductors has been given in ref .  .",
    "the authors set out a systematic comparison with the microscopic two - band eilenberger theory suggesting that the minimal tcgl model can offer a quite accurate _ quantitative _ description of features specific of two - band superconductivity , including two - length - scales vortex solutions , if one retains the full logarithmic temperature dependence of @xmath47 for temperatures smaller but not too close to @xmath20 .",
    "good agreement was achieved for temperatures as low as @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , to ensure the validity of the tcgl model used in the present work , we fix the temperature of the sample at @xmath49 and choose microscopic parameters such that both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are also close to @xmath20 ( typically , higher than 0.9 ) .",
    "such critical temperatures are also chosen in order to minimize the effects of hidden criticality in the case of weak coupling between the bands ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the calculations are performed as follows .",
    "[ eq.tcgl ] are numerically integrated by a relaxation method where a diffusion - like time - dependence of the fields is assumed .",
    "this procedure is similar to solving the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "however , once we are interested only in the stationary states , we chose the same diffusion constant , @xmath52 , for both order parameters .",
    "the equations are then discretized in space following the link - variable method and the resulting gauge - invariant , finite - difference equations are time - integrated via a semi - implicit scheme.@xcite as compared to the conventional euler method , the semi - implicit integration provides better stability and higher accuracy , which are particularly crucial for the convergence of fractional vortex solutions .",
    "the results are presented as functions of the external magnetic flux threading the disk area , @xmath53 , in units of the magnetic flux quantum , @xmath54 .",
    "the configurations corresponding to bands 1 and 2 having a phase winding number @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , are labeled as @xmath57 .",
    "in most previous studies on fractional vortex states , the main focus of analysis was on specific material parameters .",
    "however , to date there is no consensus about the correct coupling constants of , for instance , mgb@xmath2 , by far the most studied two - band material ( see for instance ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , here we adopt a different strategy and study the possible configurations of cooper pair densities in different regions of the parameter space defined by the microscopic quantities @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 .",
    "notice that in our calculations @xmath62 is a constant bound to the unit length . for a treatable analysis ,",
    "we fix only the intraband coupling constants , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the only bias in such a choice is that these values lead to @xmath50 and @xmath51 close to @xmath20 , which is important for the applicability of the ginzburg - landau framework .",
    "however , we believe that other values would impart no qualitative change to the main conclusions of our investigation .      here",
    ", we fix the interband coupling at @xmath65 and the fermi velocity ratio at @xmath66 and change only the partial densities of states , @xmath59 and @xmath67 .",
    "the main effect of changing these quantities is the relative variation of the critical temperatures of band activity , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "although our choice of intraband coupling constants ( with @xmath68 ) benefits band 1 as , in principle , the strongest band , one can always have @xmath69 if @xmath59 and @xmath67 are properly chosen .",
    "in fact , it is the product @xmath70 which determines which of the bands will dominate .",
    "it results from eq .",
    "[ eq.tcj ] that both bands has the same @xmath31 when @xmath71 . for our choice of the coupling matrix , this reads @xmath72 .",

    ", each stationary state was obtained after initializing the system with a particular @xmath57 configuration at a given value of @xmath80 and checking whether it converges to a stationary solution .",
    "once a field value was found in which that configuration is stable , we swept the field up and down to check the whole range of stability .",
    "as expected , the appearance of fractional states , i.e. , states with @xmath0 , is only possible in the range of @xmath59 and @xmath67 values for which both bands are active . outside this region ,",
    "the active band forces the passive band to follow its configuration via josephson coupling . surprisingly , both combinations @xmath78 and @xmath79 appear as stable @xmath57 states in most part of the two - active - band region , no matter which of the two bands has a higher @xmath81 .",
    "this is in contrast with previous studies , where only states with @xmath82 ( band 1 being the strongest band ) were reported .    a detailed analysis of how these states change with field and how they are energetically compared to one another is presented in fig .",

    "another important feature distinguishing `` regular '' and `` inverted '' @xmath57 solutions concerns the way these states are found .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig.fxphi ] represented by full lines were obtained after initializing the system in either the meissner state , at @xmath90 , or normal state , at @xmath91 just above the sample s upper critical field , and then isothermally sweeping the field up and down .",
    "such a procedure accounts for a realistic magnetic history and allows one to access both metastable and ground states .",
    "experimentally , it is similar to performing minor isothermal magnetization - loops measuremets on mesoscopic samples@xcite . in this case",
    ", finding a new vortex state involves entry or exit of one or more vortices through the surface barrier once a saddle point is reached.@xcite therefore , we anticipate that the fractional states represented by full lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.fxphi ] , though metastable , should be easily accessed experimentally . on the other hand",
    ", those states represented by dashed lines could not be obtained this way .",
    "instead , we used a particular vortex configuration as the initial state , in anticipation of a similar stable outcome of the calculation .",
    "we are not aware of an experimental counterpart of this process .",
    "one could then conclude that , although inverted fractional states do appear as stable solutions of the ginzburg - landau equations , they are unlikely to be observe experimentally .      in this subsection , we retain the coupling constants defined in the previously , fix @xmath92 , and analyze the effect of fermi velocities on the vortex states in a two - band mesoscopic disk . as shown in the theoretical formalism ,",
    "the fermi velocity of a band is directly proportional to the healing length of the corresponding condensate at zero temperature . in other words",

    "the role played by the fermi velocities and the healing lengths in determining the shape of the stability regions in fig .",
    "[ fig.vxphi ] can be identified as follows .",
    "as one approaches the phase boundary for band 2 activity , @xmath100 increases linearly and so does the size of a vortex in that band .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.vxphi ] ( b ) and ( c ) , where we plot the cooper pair distributions of band 1 in the ( 1,0 ) state and band 2 in the ( 0,1 ) state at a fixed applied field and different values of @xmath97 . as an estimate",
    ", we define the vortex size as the contour where the absolute value of the order parameter recovers by 50% its maximum value in the zero coupling limit , which is given by @xmath101 . within this criterion",
    ", one can clearly observe the expansion of the band-2 vortex in the ( 0,1 ) state as one approaches the phase boundary .",
    "such an increase in the characteristic length of density variations in band 2 induces a decrease in the energy barriers in this band .",
    "hence , when approaching this phase boundary , all processes involving entry or exit of a vortex in band 2 should take place in advance ( at a lower field for increasing @xmath80 and higher field for decreasing @xmath80 ) . on the other hand , since @xmath39 is fixed , one would expect no change in the size of a vortex in band 1 [ which is indeed approximately the case as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig.vxphi ] ( c ) ] and thereby no important change in the energy barriers of that band . in this case , processes involving entry or exit of vortices in band 1 are expected to take place at field values that do not change considerably with the parameter @xmath97 .",
    "the scenario explained above has an immediate consequence on how the supercooling , @xmath102 , and superheating , @xmath103 , fields of each fractional state changes with @xmath97 . in general , by sweeping the field up and down , both @xmath104 and @xmath105 states will decay to @xmath106 at the corresponding superheating field in the upward sweep or to @xmath77 at the corresponding supercooling field in the downward sweep .",
    "when the original state is @xmath104 , the @xmath106 state is achieved with the entry of a vortex in band 1 and @xmath103 is essentially constant , while @xmath77 is obtained via the escape of a vortex from band 2 , thus pushing @xmath102 to higher values as approaching band-2 phase boundary .",
    "conversely , when @xmath105 is the original state , @xmath103 is pushed to lower values , because of the advance entry of a vortex in band 2 , while @xmath102 keeps essentially constant , once only the energy barrier of band 1 is probed .",
    "the effect of josephson coupling on the stability of fractional states has been studied in ref .   and , in more detail , in ref .  .",
    "in these works the josephson coupling strength @xmath11 was treated phenomenologically , without taking into account that the microscopic , interband coupling constant @xmath58 can also exert an important influence on @xmath31 and @xmath20 , specially for higher coupling values . in this subection , we investigate the stability regions of fractional states in the @xmath58-@xmath80 plane in consonance with the microscopic background and extend the analysis to the cases of @xmath105 configurations .",

    "inverted fractional states also present similar behavior .",
    "however , their regions of stability are displaced to lower field values .",
    "this can be understood in light of our explanation of the supercooling and superheating processes of @xmath105 and @xmath104 states ( c.f .",
    "sec .  [ ssec.coupling ] ) . here",
    ", band 2 is always the weaker band .",
    "therefore , @xmath107 should be _ advanced _ to a lower value because it involves vortex entry in band 2 , while @xmath108 should be _ delayed _ to a lower value since it involves escape of a vortex from the stronger band 1 .",
    "another particularity of @xmath105 states is that , because of their higher energy , they are less resilient than @xmath104 states .",
    "in fact , for the set of parameters considered here , @xmath105 states can never be found in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "in contrast , regions of thermodynamic equilibrium for @xmath104 can be observed at very low values of @xmath58 , as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig.l12xphi ] , where these regions are represented by shaded areas .",

    "[ fig.mxphi ] illustrates the evolution of the stability regions of @xmath104 and @xmath105 states ( for @xmath116 ) when the magnetization of the disk is changed .",
    "it is promptly observed that the stability of all fractional states can be _ considerably enhanced _ by the presence of the magnetic dot .",
    "this happens for moderate positive values of @xmath111 .",
    "too large positive values tend to drive the entire system to the normal state , which of course also destroys the fractional states . on the other hand ,",
    "negative @xmath111 is deleterious to fractional states because in that case the central region of the superconducting disk encloses less flux , which disables it to host vortices in that area  while disk periphery is in any case not favorable for vortices to reside .",
    "therefore , as the external field in this region is fully compensated , the meissner state becomes predominant . upon further decreasing @xmath111 to even more negative values ,",
    "the system becomes susceptible to the appearance of integer and fractional _ antivortex _ states .",
    "the first fractional states appearing are @xmath117 and @xmath118 , followed by @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and so on .",
    "the stability regions of such fractional antivortex states correspond to a rotation of the stability regions of their counterparts with positive vorticity , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.mxphi ] , by 180@xmath121 with respect to the origin . for the parameters used in our simulations",

    "for such an analysis , we focus on a particular fractional state , ( 2,3 ) , and study the evolution of the cooper - pair density when @xmath111 and @xmath80 are simultaneously changed in a way as to keep the ( 2,3 ) state at the median of its stability field range for each magnetization value . the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.confm ] where field profiles and cooper - pair distributions of both bands are shown for the cases @xmath122 , 0 , -0.75 , and -1.125 . in all cases the local flux in the central region of the superconducting disk , where the vortices sit , has approximately the same value , @xmath123 , which is roughly the flux necessary to stabilize state ( 2,3 ) for @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , the energy barrier for vortex escape is essentially the same in all cases in such a way that the supercooling field is expected to be an approximately linearly decreasing function of @xmath111 . on the other hand , for a new vortex to come in , it has to probe the energy barrier near the superconductor edge , where the flux profile is very sensible to the magnetization of the dot . for positive @xmath111 , screening currents are weaker near the sample edges making it more difficult for a new vortex to enter .",
    "therefore the energy barrier for vortex entrance increases ( with respect to the median of the stability range ) with @xmath111 .",
    "hence , superheating is prolonged to higher field values , thereby providing the broadening of the stability range of a given vortex configuration .",
    "note that this picture holds for any vortex arrangements , including integer states .",
    "a striking feature that can be observed in fig .  [ fig.confm ] is the expansion of vortex configurations when @xmath111 is decreased down to negative values .",
    "expansion of very compact vortex configurations with the help of ferromagnetic dots has been anticipated to occur for single - band mesoscopic squares in ref . in the present case , ,",
    "we demonstrate that this effect can also be applied to multiband materials , thus providing an invaluable tool for experimental visualization of fractional vortex states .",
    "this expansion occurs because the decrease of the magnetic flux in the central region of the disk reduces the confining power of the screening currents and allows vortices to repel each other further from the center of the sample .",
    "further reduction of @xmath111 will lead to the sequential expulsion of vortices until the meissner state is reached .",
    "in addition to discussing the influence of the magnetic dot on the stability regions for given interband coupling , it is also important to analyze what happens when @xmath58 is varied .",
    "[ fig.l12md ]    -@xmath80 plane for different values of the reduced magnetization @xmath111 . ]    demonstrates that not only the range of stability of fractional states can be considerably enhanced but the maximum value of @xmath58 in which a given fractional state is stable increases as well .",
    "that is to say , _ a properly magnetized magnetic dot placed close to a mesoscopic two - band superconductor can optimally stabilize fractional vortex states _ , allowing them to be observed even in stronger intraband - coupling materials where they would be otherwise forbidden in a homogeneous field . for the @xmath125 case illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.l12md ] we found that the optimum magnetization is @xmath126 , for which the maximum value of @xmath58 where state ( 0,1 ) can be stabilized is enhanced by @xmath127 45% compared to @xmath124 case .",
    "we believe that these values can be considerably improved by exploring other configuration of the magnetic dot .",
    "however , the search of the optimum configuration is beyond the scope of this work ; we restrict ourselves here to the proof - of - concept .",
    "although we present here only the @xmath125 case , we verified that the same conclusions apply to other fractional states , but of course with different optimum magnetization values .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the stability of fractional vortex states in a mesoscopic superconductor with respect to changing its microscopic material parameters and to the magnetization state of a magnetic dot placed nearby . by sweeping a broad range of values of the partial density of states and of the fermi velocities for a given coupling matrix",
    ", we have determined the stability regions of many different fractional vortex states .",
    "we could identify two main groups of such solutions : the first one comprises those states where the dominating band , i.e. that one with the highest @xmath31 , has a lower total winding number ; the second group comprises states where the dominating band has the highest winding number . as expected , states of the first group have , in general , lower energy and are easier to find because the dominating band has a natural tendency to be more refractory to vortices . in addition , they can be found in thermodynamic equilibrium for the case of weak josephson coupling , as previously reported in the literature.@xcite however , the states in each of these groups can exchange roles smoothly by sweeping the partial density of states .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the healing length of a band at zero temperature , defined as @xmath29 , is closely connected to the size of a vortex in that band and thereby to the ability of the surface barrier to superheat or supercool fractional states in applied magnetic field .",
    "we have further investigated the properties of fractional vortex states in _ inhomogeneous _ magnetic field .",
    "in particular , we exposed the superconducting disk to the stray field of a magnetic dot , placed coaxially above the sample .",
    "we demonstrated that such a configuration is capable of augmenting the stability region of fractional states , at least when the dot magnetization is parallel to the external homogeneous field .",
    "moreover , the maximum value of interband coupling for which a given fractional state is stable can be increased considerably and reaches an optimal value at a well defined magnetization of the dot .",
    "this is an important result because fractional states are usually possible only in materials with very weak interband coupling . in other words ,",
    "the here proposed idea enables observation of fractional vortex states in a considerably wider range of multiband materials .    finally , we point out that , to date , experiments determining vortex structures in two - band superconductors have been restricted to bulk single crystals . however , mesoscopic systems present a much richer variety of vortex states , including non - composite fractional vortices , which represent a clear , direct evidence of competing length scales in multiband materials .",
    "we believe our findings contribute to the construction of a roadmap guiding further search of suitable materials for imaging these exotic vortex structures . in this respect ,",
    "further investigation on other geometries of the mesoscopic superconductor and the magnetic dot aiming at the stabilization of fractional vortices in wider parameter ranges would be very much welcome .",
