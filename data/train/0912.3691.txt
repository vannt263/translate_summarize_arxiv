    "roger penrose tells the story of how the importance of closed trapped surfaces occurred to him while crossing a street in london .",
    "he then promptly forgot about the matter , but  fortunately  recalled it later in the day @xcite .",
    "one can make a case for trapped surfaces being the single most important ingredient in gravitational collapse .",
    "their popular acclaim has been clouded by the fact that they remain hidden behind the event horizon , but numerical relativists do encounter them , while the very existence of the event horizon may be in some doubt from quantum gravity .",
    "can one _ define _ a black hole using its trapped surfaces @xcite ?",
    "an important notion here is the dynamical horizon , a spacelike hypersurface foliated by marginally trapped surfaces @xcite .",
    "but not enough is known about the uniqueness of such objects @xcite .",
    "indeed little is actually known about where trapped surfaces occur even in the simple vaidya solution , which describes the collapse of a spherically symmetric cloud of incoherent radiation ( or `` null dust '' ) @xcite .",
    "this is the situation that we have tried to remedy , with partial success .",
    "any dynamical horizon lies inside the trapping boundary , defined as the boundary of an inextendible spacetime region for which each point lies on some trapped surface @xcite . in very simple cases",
    "this boundary is easily found . in the vaidya spacetime",
    "it must lie somewhere between the event horizon and a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon , but coincides with neither @xcite . here",
    "we will present a family of closed trapped surfaces that extend into the no - man s land between them .",
    "the surfaces we consider are genuinely trapped , in that both of their null expansions are non - positive , whereas much of the recent literature concerns outer trapped surfaces for which no condition is imposed on the inner expansion .",
    "there are good reasons for this @xcite , but there are reasons for our choice too @xcite .",
    "the reader must not confuse the two .",
    "eardley conjectured that the boundary of the region through which closed outer trapped surfaces pass is the event horizon @xcite , and for the vaidya case this was proven by ben - dov @xcite .",
    "a spacetime where the trapping boundary can be identified almost by inspection is the recollapsing @xmath0 friedmann model .",
    "it is foliated by round 3-spheres and has a moment of time symmetry for which the trace @xmath1 of the second fundamental form vanishes .",
    "any equatorial sphere in such a 3-sphere is minimal within the 3-sphere , and trapped if @xmath2 .",
    "the null expansions vanish at the moment of time symmetry , so we expect this to be the trapping boundary .",
    "but how do we prove that a closed trapped surface can not extend partly below it ?",
    "let @xmath3 project the cotangent space onto the cotangent space of some spacelike surface of codimension two .",
    "let @xmath4 be the projection of an arbitrary spacetime vector field @xmath5 , and let @xmath6 be the shape tensor of the surface .",
    "then    @xmath7    the derivative on the right hand side uses the levi - civita connection of the first fundamental form . if we symmetrise and then contract with the first fundamental form we obtain",
    "@xmath8    where @xmath9 is the mean curvature vector .",
    "this is future directed and timelike for a trapped surface .",
    "suppose that the vector field @xmath5 is future directed and timelike too , so that @xmath10 , and suppose that @xmath5 is such that the left hand side of this equation is non - negative . if we integrate over a closed surface the divergence goes away and we have a contradiction .",
    "either the surface extends into a region where @xmath5 is spacelike , or else it is not trapped @xcite .",
    "if the vector field @xmath5 is hypersurface forming we can say more .",
    "assume that there exist functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that    @xmath13    on a closed surface the function @xmath12 will assume a minimum .",
    "at that minimum    @xmath14    if @xmath5 is such that the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ojoj ] ) is positive semidefinite we conclude that    @xmath15    at the minimum of @xmath12 . since @xmath5 is timelike , the mean curvature vector @xmath16 can not be , and the surface can not be trapped at the minimum of @xmath12 .    to return to the friedmann model , it admits a future directed conformal killing vector field for which the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ojoj ] ) is positive prior to the moment of time symmetry , and this is what we need in order to prove that the moment of time symmetry is indeed the trapping boundary . through every point of this trapping boundary",
    "there passes a marginally trapped and indeed minimal closed surface .",
    "examples where this is not so include open recollapsing friedmann models where the trapping boundary is filled by minimal surfaces that are not closed .",
    "an intermediate case is provided by the btz wormhole , where minimal closed surfaces are dense in the trapping boundary , but do not pass through every point there @xcite .",
    "the minimum argument can be used to give a stronger conclusion about the trapping boundary . at a minimum in @xmath12    @xmath17",
    "the left hand side is a projection of the second fundamental form of a hypersurface orthogonal to @xmath5 .",
    "the laplacian is positive at the minimum , and the scalar product is negative if the surface is trapped , so the right hand side is negative .",
    "therefore the second fundamental form must have at least one negative eigenvalue if a trapped surface otherwise to its future touches a hypersurface in a point . in 2 + 1 dimensional minkowski space this is easy to see : a trapped `` surface '' is then a spacelike curve bending downwards in inertial time , and a surface with positive definite second fundamental form is like a hyperboloid bending upwards in time . obviously a trapped curve otherwise in its future can not touch it in a point .",
    "we now turn to vaidya s spacetime , with the metric    @xmath18    einstein s equations read    @xmath19    the energy conditions are obeyed provided that @xmath20 , where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath21",
    ". otherwise the rate at which radiation comes in is at our disposal .",
    "we choose    @xmath22    this describes a spherically symmetric shell of incoherent radiation entering flat spacetime from past null infinity , ending in a schwarzschild black hole when the inflow stops  provided that @xmath23 , otherwise the result is a naked singularity @xcite .",
    "other choices of mass function have been studied @xcite .",
    "our choice is special because the vaidya region of the solution has a homothetic killing vector    @xmath24    whose flow lines are confined to hypersurfaces with constant @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "this extra symmetry will be quite helpful to us .",
    "we expect that the behaviour for a somewhat different mass function would be qualitatively similar but harder to get .",
    "the round spheres at @xmath27 are marginally trapped and foliate a regular dynamical horizon .",
    "we refer to it as the apparent horizon , because it is the apparent horizon in a spherically symmetric slicing of spacetime , and we do not wish to prejudge the issue whether there are other , non - spherically symmetric dynamical horizons present .    in a spherically symmetric spacetime",
    "the coordinate @xmath28 has a meaning related to the area of the preferred round spheres .",
    "there is also a very special vector field known as the kodama vector field @xmath29 @xcite . in our case",
    "it is @xmath30 .",
    "it is not a killing vector field in general , but it does define a direction in which the area of the preferred round spheres is constant .",
    "it is hypersurface forming , and future directed and timelike outside the apparent horizon . through eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) it defines a `` kodama time '' @xmath12 in this region , and this can be used in the minimum argument presented in section 2 .",
    "a trapped surface sticking out of the apparent horizon at some value of @xmath12 can only reach higher values in its exterior .",
    "therefore trapped surfaces at values of @xmath12 smaller than the smallest value @xmath31 assumed on the apparent horizon itself are excluded .",
    "setting @xmath32 defines a spacelike hypersurface @xmath33 , touching the apparent horizon just where the latter joins the event horizon .",
    "it is spherically symmetric and defined by a function @xmath34 obeying    @xmath35    this is easily solved for in terms of elementary functions in the self - similar case @xcite . in the flat region constant kodama time means constant intertial time , and the hypersurface @xmath33 will enter the flat region if and only if @xmath36 .",
    "is it possible that @xmath33 is the trapping boundary we look for ?",
    "in fact it can not be , since the eigenvalues of its second fundamental form are @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "but we have already argued that such a hypersurface can not be touched by marginally trapped surfaces .",
    "there must be a region to the future of @xmath33 which is free of trapped surfaces , but at least we have constrained the trapping boundary from below .",
    "we have also proved that the latter must be spacelike close to the event horizon , since it is squeezed from below by the spacelike @xmath33 .",
    "is it possible that the trapping boundary coincides with the apparent horizon ?",
    "in fact no @xcite .",
    "an argument due to galloway and wald shows that marginally trapped round spheres in a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon can always be perturbed in such a way that they extend partly outside it , and such that the perturbation causes them to become trapped @xcite .",
    "but their argument does not show how far below the apparent horizon these trapped surfaces extend . here",
    "we will present a ",
    "non - optimal  construction which allows us to find closed trapped surfaces extending a finite distance away from the apparent horizon .",
    "our surfaces are defined as cross sections of a cone , by means of the two equations    @xmath39    when @xmath40 this surface sits on the apparent horizon .",
    "when @xmath41 is large the surface may extend into the schwarzschild or minkowski regions of the solution , but we stick to the above definition ",
    "it defines a smoothly embedded surface in @xmath42 , although its first fundamental form will not be smooth and its null expansions will jump at the boundaries between different regions .",
    "the condition for outer trapping is the somewhat lengthy inequality    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the outer null expansion , @xmath45 is a positive normalisation factor , and    @xmath46    to simplify the calculation we set    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is a legendre polynomial . together with eqs .",
    "( [ surface ] ) this defines a set of `` tongues '' that  as we will see  stick partly out of the apparent horizon .",
    "to first order in @xmath49 the trapping condition becomes simply @xmath50 , and the tongue extends partly outside the apparent horizon if there is a @xmath51 such that @xmath52 .",
    "this is the perturbation considered by galloway and wald @xcite .",
    "our aim is now to adjust the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 for every given @xmath55 in such a way that the extent to which the tongue sticks out of the horizon is maximised . to deal with the inequality ( [ trapm ] )",
    "we had to fall back on mathematica .",
    "general considerations about when the cone becomes tangential to hypersurfaces of constant kodama time show that the possible extent of the tongue is larger the smaller @xmath56 is , so we confined ourselves to @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "then we investigated the two cases @xmath59 and @xmath60 in detail and found  for the case when the tongues remain in the vaidya region of spacetime  that the most stringent condition from the inequality comes at the tips of the tongue , where @xmath61 .",
    "but once this is so the inequality ( [ trapm ] ) is easily dealt with analytically . for @xmath62 , @xmath57 ,",
    "the trapping conditions at the tips hold as long as    @xmath63    @xmath64    this is then how far a maximally extended closed trapped tongue extends .",
    "the inner trapping condition holds throughout the allowed region .",
    "thus the region occupied by trapped tongues is bounded by hypersurfaces of constant @xmath25 .",
    "given that the trapping condition becomes critical at the tips of the tongues this could have been predicted , because it is known that if the outer null expansion vanishes at a point it remains zero if the surface is moved by a homothety @xcite . in the self - similar vaidya solution",
    "this is generated by the vector field @xmath65 , see eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) .    to the left is a penrose diagram of a vaidya spacetime .",
    "the region inside the dashed curve is shown as a @xmath66-diagram to the right , and includes a part of the event horizon ( eh ) , the spacelike part of the apparent horizon ( ah ) , and the hypersurface @xmath33 below which no trapped surfaces can extend .",
    "the tongues considered in the text are confined between two lines of constant @xmath25 , and can extend only a little bit into the schwarzschild region s. the trapped surfaces discussed earlier @xcite are to the left of the dotted curve .",
    "the figure is for @xmath59 only.,width=297 ]    for the two values of @xmath67 that we investigated in detail we also found that the intrinsic curvature @xmath68 of the tongue obeys @xmath69 throughout the region where it is trapped , thus disproving a conjecture by hayward @xcite .",
    "so far we have avoided the complication that the tongues may extend into the minkowski or schwarzschild regions , where the mass function is different .",
    "this must now be dealt with .",
    "it is no longer true that the trapping condition is always at its most stringent at the tips of the tongue . after a lengthy mathematica calculation we found , however , that the upper schwarzschild tip is usually the place where trapping fails first .",
    "the result is that the region into which the tongues can extend shrinks  as indeed it must , since its boundary must reach the point where the dynamical horizon meets the event horizon .",
    "see fig . 1 for a summary of the calculation in the @xmath59 case .",
    "for @xmath60 the tongues can extend into the flat region .",
    "it is not the case though that the schwarzschild region makes life more difficult for all kinds of closed trapped surfaces .",
    "indeed the flat and vaidya region has locally trapped surfaces in the equatorial plane @xmath70 .",
    "topologically they are open disks meeting the schwarzschild boundary in a circle .",
    "if they are carefully adjusted , and do not extend to large values of @xmath28 , it is possible to close them in the schwarzschild region while keeping them trapped , so the schwarzschild region in a sense creates closed trapped surfaces that could not exist without it @xcite .",
    "a large part of the no - man s land between the dynamical horizon and the event horizon has now been occupied by the trapped region , but we have not been able to pin down its boundary precisely .",
    "some things are clear : in a spherically symmetric spacetime the trapping boundary must itself be spherically symmetric , it can not contain any marginally trapped surfaces , it can not have a positive definite second fundamental form , and it must be spacelike close to the event horizon because it is squeezed from below by the spacelike hypersurface @xmath33 . from our picture for @xmath59",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that a part of the boundary sits at @xmath71 constant .",
    "this part would be determined entirely by the behaviour of trapped surfaces inside the self - similar vaidya region .",
    "but for @xmath60 the trapping boundary is determined largely by what happens inside the schwarzschild region  not by the local physics in the vaidya region .",
    "our calculations have not addressed the question to what extent the dynamical horizon is unique .",
    "this also remains as an interesting question .",
