    "since the launch of the _ einstein  _ x - ray observatory in the late 1970 s , we have known that discrete , point - like x - ray sources form a major constituent of the overall x - ray output of spiral galaxies , along with hot diffuse gas and in some cases an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are a variety of compact sources that emit with sufficient luminosity in the x - ray regime to be observable in nearby galaxies .",
    "these include accreting sources , such as black hole / neutron star x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) and supersoft sources ( ssss ) , plus bright thermal supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "while _ einstein _ , and later _ rosat _ , provided a preliminary view of the x - ray source populations of nearby galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , these studies were hindered by a lack of both spatial resolution and photon collecting area , leading to source confusion and limited spectroscopic capabilities .",
    "now , with the current generation of x - ray observatories , _ xmm - newton  _ and _ chandra _ , substantial progress is being made in this field .",
    "the sub - arcsecond spatial resolution of _ chandra  _ has led to up to a factor 100 increase in the number of sources detected in many galaxies .",
    "for example , the recent _ chandra  _ survey of 11 nearby spirals of @xcite has resolved on average 75 point sources per galaxy , with luminosities extending down to 5@xmath1 .",
    "the luminosity functions derived from _",
    "chandra  _ studies have also demonstrated that the overall x - ray emission in spiral / star - forming galaxies are typically dominated by a few bright extra - nuclear sources ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , the brightest of which are the ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) with luminosities @xmath2 ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the complementary high throughput and large @xmath0 30 arcminute field - of - view of _ xmm - newton  _ can be used for detailed spectral and variability studies of the brightest point sources in nearby galaxies .",
    "this has been demonstrated to great effect in the first paper in this series ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) , as well as the studies of m33 @xcite and the archetypal starburst galaxy ngc  253 @xcite .",
    "the target for this study is m101 , a nearby ( @xmath3=7.2mpc , @xcite ) grand - design spiral galaxy similar in morphological type to our own milky way .",
    "its full face - on aspect and relatively low line - of - sight galactic hydrogen column ( @xmath4 , @xcite ) makes it an ideal laboratory for the study of the x - ray emission from compact discrete sources in spiral galaxies .",
    "m101 was first studied at x - ray energies with _",
    "einstein  _",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) , revealing x - ray emission associated with the nuclear region and regions in the spiral arms .",
    "rosat  _ studies revealed the presence of numerous discrete sources @xcite as well as a substantial diffuse component @xcite .",
    "more recently , a _",
    "chandra  _ observation has revealed @xmath5 100 discrete sources in the central @xmath08 arcminutes of the galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , as well as diffuse emission tracing the spiral arms @xcite .",
    "this is the second of a series of papers on the _ xmm - newton  _ observation of m101 . in paper",
    "i , we presented the spectral and timing properties of the most luminous x - ray sources at the time of the _ xmm - newton  _ observation , many of which were in the ulx regime , and showed properties consistent with high - state xrbs . in this paper , we present the global properties of the complete set of x - ray sources detected within the spatial extent of m101 in the _ xmm - newton  _ observation , complemented with an analysis of two archival sets of _",
    "chandra  _ observations of m101 .",
    "an analysis of the diffuse x - ray emission will be presented in paper iii ( warwick et al .",
    ", _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "this paper is set out as follows . in section  [ sec : obs ] we outline the observation details and data reduction techniques . in section  [ sec : src_detection ] we detail the source detection techniques used , and the full source list is presented in section  [ sec : catalogue ] . in section  [ sec : xcolours ] we broadly classify the sources according to their x - ray colours , and in section  [ sec : timing ] we search for short - term variability within the _ xmm - newton  _ observation , and long - term source variability using archival x - ray observations . in section  [ sec : class ] , we discuss the properties of the various source types , and in section  [ sec : conc ] we summarise our results .",
    "m101 was observed with _",
    "xmm - newton  _ for 42.8ks on the 4th june 2002 ( obsid 0104260101 ) .",
    "the epic mos-1 , mos-2 & pn cameras were operated with medium filters in `` prime full window '' mode , which utilizes the full @xmath6 arcminute field of view of _ xmm - newton _ , covering the entire 25 ellipse of m101 ( @xmath028.8 arcminutes diameter , @xcite ) .",
    "the data were pipeline - processed using the sas ( _ science analysis software _ ) v5.3.2 and all subsequent data analysis was carried out using sas v5.4.1 .    in this study",
    "we have performed source detection on both the pn and mos data ( see section  [ sec : src_detection ] ) . to increase the sensitivity of the mos data",
    ", the mos1 and mos2 event lists were merged together using the sas task merge . for the purposes of multi - band source detection ( see section  [ sec : src_detection ] ) ,",
    "images were created in the following three energy bands : 0.31kev ( soft ) , 12kev ( medium ) and 26kev ( hard ) .",
    "the data were filtered using patterns corresponding to single & double pixel events for the pn ( 0 & 14 ) , and patterns 0 - 12 ( single to quadruple events ) for the mos cameras , together with the # xmmea_em ( mos ) and # xmmea_ep ( pn ) flags to remove hot pixels or out - of - field events .",
    "full - field lightcurves were accumulated for the three exposures to check for high background intervals of soft proton flares .",
    "there were numerous small flares throughout the exposure .",
    "for the mos data , we screened out time intervals corresponding to the four most prominent peaks with count rates greater than @xmath015 counts per second , leaving a net good time for each camera of 36.7ks . in the case of the pn data ,",
    "inspection of the hard band ( 26kev ) images showed a greater contamination from flaring . in order to maximise the sensitivity of the data to the source detection algorithms",
    ", we further cleaned the data by selecting good time intervals ( gtis ) corresponding to less than 0.9 counts per second ( 1015kev ) in the single pattern lightcurve , leaving a net good time for the pn data of 25.7ks .",
    "as in paper i , this dataset is supplemented with two archival _",
    "chandra  _ observations of m101 .",
    "these consist of one long ( @xmath0 100ks ) observation performed on the 26th march 2000 ( obsid 934 ) , plus a short ( @xmath0 10ks ) observation performed on the 29th october 2000 ( obsid 2065 ) .",
    "though the first analysis of the central acis - s3 chip in the long observation is presented in @xcite , we have used the analysis of both data sets presented in @xcite to search for long - term spectral and flux source changes .",
    "this analysis utilizes more up - to - date calibration files and includes sources from five acis chips , covering a larger fraction ( 78 per cent ) of the 25 ellipse of m101 .",

    "four matches were found ; three using _ chandra  _ positions ( _ xmm  _ source numbers # 40 , 67 & 74 ) , and one with the bright _ xmm  _ source ( # 46/xmm-1 ) whose position matches that of mf37 to @xmath0 2 arcseconds .",
    "we also list the matches between the faint _",

    "overall , 74 _",

    "of the remainder , 20 are coincident with and/or snrs , 7 have identified / candidate background agn / galaxy counterparts , 6 are coincident with foreground stars and one has a radio counterpart .",
    "in paper i , we performed detailed spectral analyses of the fourteen brightest sources in the _ xmm  _ field with sufficient counts for spectral fitting ( @xmath5 300 in the pn data ) . here , we attempt to broadly classify the complete _ xmm  _ source population according to their x - ray colours ( hardness ratios ) .",
    "although we can not definitively classify any source by its x - ray colour alone , this approach can be a useful starting point for source identification as well as giving insights into the overall source population of a galaxy .",
    "we have used the x - ray colour classification scheme of @xcite and @xcite , which was developed to classify _",
    "chandra  _ point sources using the colours of known xrbs and snrs .",
    "we have modified the scheme for _ xmm  _ epic data , ensuring that the source categories cover the same spectral ranges as the _ chandra  _ scheme ( figure  [ fig : xcolours ] ) . the distribution in this colour space of sources detected with both pn and mos ( i.e. ` epic ' ) with @xmath8=0.53 and absorption values of @xmath9 is shown in figure  [ fig : xcolours ] ( top left ) , with ellipses illustrating the upper and lower boundaries of the coarse colour ranges for different source categories ( see table  [ table : xcolours ] for details ) . for consistency with the data ( see section  [ sec : catalogue ] ) , the epic power - law grid was calculated using the mean of the separate model pn and mos hardness ratios at each point .",
    "the xrb range encompasses sources with spectral shapes equivalent to a power - law slope of @xmath1012.5 , typical of low- and high - mass xrbs ( @xcite and references therein ) , and the snr range covers soft sources ( @xmath11 ) with low absorption , typical of the soft thermal spectra of known snrs .",
    "the absorbed source range applies to sources with @xmath12 , and the background source range covers objects with complex two - component spectra with highly absorbed power - law continua and soft excesses .    in figure  [ fig : xcolours ] ( top right ) the x - ray colours of the sources detected in both the pn and mos cameras are plotted . for sources detected only in either the pn or mos data ,",
    "we have plotted their separate hardness ratios with equivalent classification spectral ranges applicable to the pn and mos responses in figure  [ fig : xcolours ] ( bottom ) . in general , the sources detected by pn only are near mos chip gaps / detector edges or are very soft sources as is shown in figure  [ fig : xcolours ] ( bottom left ) .",
    "this higher sensitivity to soft sources is to be expected , as the pn camera has a much greater effective area at soft energies than the mos cameras .",
    "for the mos only sources ( figure  [ fig : xcolours ] , bottom right ) , the distribution of hardness ratios is more even , and they were generally not detected in the pn data because they were either outside the pn field of view or near pn chip gaps .",
    "since the sources are expected to ( and indeed have ) a variety of spectral shapes , they are not all detected significantly in all three energy bands .",
    "we have therefore plotted the sources in the x - ray colour plane using the following symbols : circle ( ttt ) , box ( ttf ) ; triangle ( ftt ) ; star ( tff ) ; cross ( ftf ) ; diamond ( fft ) denoting sources detected ( t ) or not detected ( f ) significantly in the soft , medium and hard bands respectively . for this purpose ,",
    "a 3@xmath7 detection threshold is used ( rather than the 4@xmath7 used for source detection ) to provide a better estimation of the intrinsic spectral shapes of the sources .",
    "the sources are distributed among the four designated colour - colour categories as follows : 62 xrbs , 15 snrs , 11 absorbed sources and 5 background sources .",
    "in addition , there are 15 candidate ssss i.e. sources only detected significantly in the soft band ( see section  [ sec : sss ] ) .",
    "these are not included in any of the four categories , but appear at hr1@xmath13 - 1 ( marked with stars in figure  [ fig : xcolours ] ) .",
    "however , additional information such as source variability , position in the galaxy and multiwavelength counterparts should be taken into account when classifying sources , and each category is discussed in turn in section  [ sec : class ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : im_nh ] , the positions of the sources are plotted on an map and an _",
    "xmm  _ optical monitor ( om ) uv image of m101 , with colours denoting where the sources lie in the classification scheme .",
    "in paper i , eleven of the fourteen brightest sources in the _ xmm  _ observation were found to be variable at @xmath5 95 per cent probability using @xmath14 , kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) and standard deviation tests ( see table 5 , paper i ) .",
    "for the majority of the remainder of the sources , we do not have sufficient counts for such detailed analyses .",
    "instead , we have performed simple standard deviation tests in the following manner .",
    "firstly , for consistency between the datasets and to filter out as much background variability as possible , the heavier time filter used in the pn source detection was applied to the mos data .",
    "sources were then divided into categories of 2 , 4 , 6 & 8 time bin resolutions depending on their total ( background subtracted ) counts ( pn+mos ) detected during this period ( @xmath0 26ks ) , ensuring at least 20 counts per bin for each source . images were created for each time bin category using equally - spaced time intervals , and the source counts in each determined with emldetect .",
    "fifty - one sources had sufficient counts for a 2 time - bin resolution only , and for these we compared the two values with their respective 1@xmath7 errors . of these , only two were variable above the 95 per cent level ( # 19 at 2.7@xmath7 & # 90 at 2.8@xmath7 ) .",
    "for the remaining sources with 4 , 6 & 8 time bins , we calculated a standard deviation of the number of counts per bin from the mean , and compared this to the expected deviation of @xmath0 22 per cent expected from gaussian counting noise .",
    "only three sources ( # 25 , 70 & 105 ) were variable at @xmath5 95 per cent .",
    "as each had comparably high numbers of counts ( @xmath5 200 ) , we confirmed their variability by extracting full short - term light - curves , again with time bin sizes tailored so so that each bin had at least 20 counts after background subtraction .",
    "again , to minimize contamination from soft proton flaring , we applied the heavier time filtering to the data , and corrected the exposure times and count rates in incomplete bins with a simple scaling factor , excluding bins with @xmath150.3 times the exposure remaining of the original bin size .",
    "the resulting light curves are shown in figure  [ fig : lcurve ] , and @xmath14 tests showed each to be variable at greater than 99.73 per cent probability .",
    "interestingly , two of these variable sources are the two bright foreground stars ( # 25 & 105 ) , which were excluded from our analyses in paper i as they were not associated with m101 ( see section  [ sec : stars ] for further discussion ) . in total , 16 sources show short - term variability above the 95 per cent level in this dataset ( including the variable bright sources from paper i ) , which we denote with an ` s ' in column 10 of table  [ table : srclist ] .        to search for long - term source variability ,",
    "we have compared the observed fluxes in the _ xmm  _ observation with those measured in the _",
    "chandra  _ observations conducted @xmath0 2 years previously , plus four archival _",
    "rosat  _ hri observations .",

    "xmm  _ sources were detected in at least one of the four hri observations , thirteen of which are the bright sources analysed in paper i. since the hri count rates quoted in @xcite are averages of the four individual observations , we have re - analysed the archival data sets ( as per @xcite ) , measuring count rates ( or upper limits ) in the 0.52kev band for each individual observation .",
    "seventy one _ xmm  _ sources are matched in the _ chandra  _ observations , ten of which are confused ( or possibly confused ) with nearby sources . where sources were detected in both _",
    "chandra  _ observations , the source counts from the longer observation were used to ensure the most accurate flux determinations . for consistency between the data sets , the measured count rates from the _",
    "chandra  _ and _ rosat  _ observations were converted into fluxes in the 0.36kev band using ecfs determined from webpimms , using the same spectral model used for the _ xmm  _ flux conversions ( @xmath8=1.7 , @xmath16=@xmath17 ) .",
    "to quantify this variability , we have compared the maximum to minimum observed fluxes of each source in this multi - mission data set .",
    "xmm_/_rosat  _ sources shown to be confused by multiple source detections in the _ chandra  _ observations , flux changes were only deemed real in the _ chandra  _ data if the variability was only apparent using the flux of the source matching most closely to the _ xmm  _ position , as opposed to the combined flux of the confused sources . in total , 37 sources show long - term variability at @xmath18 , with 26 variable above the 3@xmath7 level .",
    "the majority ( 32 of 37 ) vary by a factor of 1.54 between the highest and lowest observed fluxes .",
    "the most variable sources are # 21 , 53 & 87 , which vary by factors of 68 , and # 56 ( a foreground star ) , which is @xmath0 17 times fainter than in a _",
    "rosat  _ observation in 1992 .",
    "the most variable source we detect is # 55/xmm-2 ( see section  [ sec : trans ] below ) .",
    "in addition , 30 _ xmm  _ sources have not been detected in any previous x - ray observation , and we have investigated whether this is due to real source variability as opposed to differing coverage and/or lack of photon sensitivity .",
    "fourteen sources are covered by the two _",
    "chandra  _ observations ; the flux limits on the positions of four ( # 3 , 13 , 58 & 100 ) imply that they have all brightened by at least factors of 35 between between the _",
    "chandra  _ and _ xmm  _ observations , while eight are at or below the detection thresholds at their positions .",
    "the remaining two sources ( # 24 & 29 ) are sufficiently variable to be classified as transients ( see section  [ sec : trans ] below ) .",
    "the whole field was covered in the _ rosat  _ hri observations , but all but one of the _ xmm  _ sources with no hri matches fall below the flux limit of the longest 108ks hri observation ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , extrapolated to the 0.36kev band ) and therefore can not be classed as variable based on these data .",
    "the only exception is # 35 , which should have been detected in the both of the longest hri observations .",
    "the flux limits of these observations imply an increase in luminosity of this source of at least a factor of @xmath0 2 in the _ xmm  _ observation .    in total , 44 _",
    "xmm  _ sources ( @xmath0 40 per cent of the source population ) show long - term variability , either by direct measurement with detections at different epochs ( at @xmath18 ) or by the implied variations of the flux limits of the archival data .",
    "these are all denoted by ` l ' in column 10 of table[table : srclist ] .",
    "transient behaviour is characteristic of low - mass xrb ( lmxb ) systems , with observed outbursts believed to be caused by hydrogen - ionization instabilities in the accretion disc around the primary black hole / neutron star ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "such outbursts do not generally occur in high - mass xrbs ( hmxbs ) , as the companion star is a sufficient source of irradiation to keep the accretion disc in a stable ionized state ( although it is possible that they could occur in hmxbs with be - star companions , see @xcite ) .",
    "galactic soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) have quiescent x - ray luminosities in the @xmath21 range ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and often increase by a factor of @xmath22 or more in outburst @xcite . since such faint quiescent sources are beyond the flux limits of any existing x - ray observation of m101 , we have searched for _ candidate _ transient sources by comparing the full _",
    "xmm  _ sourcelist with previous _",
    "chandra  _ and _ rosat  _ detections to ascertain lower limits on the flux variability of highly variable sources . for these purposes",
    "we define candidate transient sources as those varying by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "the most obvious transient candidate detected in the _ xmm  _ observation is # 55/xmm-2 , which has a luminosity a factor of @xmath0 30 brighter than the flux level seen in previous observations ( see paper i ) .",
    "another highly variable source is the most luminous ulx ( p98 ) in the long _ chandra  _",
    "observation @xcite .",
    "it was initially detected in a _",
    "rosat  _ observation ( h32 ) , and increased in flux by a factor of @xmath0 5 in the later _ chandra  _ observation .",
    "it then fell below the detection threshold in the _ xmm  _ observation , implying another drop in luminosity of at least a factor of @xmath0 20 .",
    "for an additional two _",
    "xmm  _ sources not detected by _",
    "chandra _ , the difference between their fluxes and the flux limits in the _",
    "chandra  _ observations at those positions imply variability large enough to be classed as candidate transient behaviour .",
    "source # 24 with sss x - ray colours shows a massive increase of a factor of at least @xmath0 580 in the _ xmm  _ observation , while # 29 must have increased by a factor of at least @xmath0 20 .",
    "it is also worth noting that there are another four bright _ rosat  _ hri sources ( @xmath23 in the 0.36kev band ) that are undetected in the _",
    "xmm  _ observation , suggesting transient behaviour .",
    "two sources , h28 with a ulx luminosity of @xmath24 in the first hri observation , and h31 with @xmath25 in the second observation , are both undetected by _",
    "chandra  _ and _",
    "xmm_. h15 is detected in the fourth hri observation with @xmath20 , but is then detected with _",
    "chandra  _ with a factor of @xmath0 5 lower flux .",
    "another source , h34 , is detected in the combined hri dataset by @xcite , with an average luminosity of @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we identify eight candidate transient sources in total using these datasets .",
    "nineteen sources show variability at the 3@xmath7 level between the _ xmm  _ and _ chandra  _ observations , ten increasing and nine decreasing in flux .",
    "since xrbs and ulxs are known to undergo spectral transitions as their accretion rates change , we have compared the x - ray colours of these sources in both observations to search for such behaviour . to directly compare the source colours between the observations ,",
    "correction factors were applied to the _",
    "chandra  _ x - ray colours to account for the differences in energy response and effective area of the two telescopes .",
    "the correction factors were calculated as the differences in the soft and hard colours for representative average spectral models for xrbs ( @xmath8=1.5 , @xmath16=@xmath27 ) , snrs ( @xmath8=3 , @xmath16=@xmath28 ) and absorbed sources ( @xmath8=1.5 , @xmath16=@xmath29 ) , and were applied depending on the source positions on the equivalent _",
    "chandra  _ colour - colour plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : colour_changes ] shows the changes in the hard ( hr2 ) x - ray colour versus the change in luminosity between the two observations as a fraction of the _",
    "chandra  _ luminosity [ @xmath30=(@xmath31 .",
    "note that we have not used the soft ( hr1 ) colour to look for intrinsic colour changes , as this is much more sensitive to varying absorption within m101 .",
    "the two foreground stars are not plotted in this diagram , nor do we plot the ssss as their hard colours are unconstrained .",
    "the transient source ( # 55/xmm-2 ) is also excluded as its change in luminosity is far larger than the other sources ( @xmath3232 ) and it has no significant colour variation .",
    "although these thirteen sources all show some shift in colour between the observations , all but two remain in the same spectral classification between the observations as expected .",
    "the exceptions are # 20/xmm-4 , which increases in flux between the _",
    "chandra  _ and _ xmm  _ observations , moving from the absorbed to the xrb class , and # 87 located in the giant region ngc  5462 , which decreases in flux and moves from the xrb to the snr class ( see section  [ sec : snr ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the majority of sources do not appear to follow the ` canonical ' low / hard ( lh ) power - law dominated to high / soft ( hs ) disc - dominated state transitions seen in many galactic black hole binary systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "only four sources follow this pattern using the hr2 colour ( # 41/xmm-12 , # 65/xmm-14 , # 102/xmm-3 & # 78 ) , three of which are bright sources analysed in detail in paper i. the remaining sources fall into the opposite quadrants where the fainter the source , the softer its spectrum and vice versa , and recent studies with _ xmm - newton  _ and _ chandra  _ have demonstrated that many bright ulxs do display this behaviour ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . although there may be underlying physical reasons for this type of behaviour in xrbs ( see for example @xcite ) , we must consider whether these results may partly be due to the x - ray energy bands covered by both _",
    "xmm - newton  _ and _ chandra  _ in these studies ( typically 0.310kev ) .",
    "indeed , when using the broader band 28kev/0.32kev flux ratio in paper i , seven sources did show a typical softening with increasing luminosity .",
    "the main spectral states of xrbs have traditionally been defined using a much harder 220kev energy range , covered by e.g. the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ , see @xcite ) .",
    "since the sources in our sample have luminosities at @xmath33 , they are possibly in disc - dominated states . if their inner disc temperatures are @xmath012kev , they will contribute to the spectrum mainly at 16kev .",
    "if the flux change is coming from the emergence of the disc relative to the power - law component , the spectrum can appear to get harder in the 12kev range compared to the 26kev range .",
    "therefore , we could still be observing the classic power - law to disc state transition ; however observations of large samples of xrbs in this wider x - ray spectral band will be needed to confirm whether this is the case .",
    "we can estimate the probability of any of our detections being background sources using the hard - band ( 210kev ) integral log(@xmath34)log(@xmath35 ) relationship of @xcite .",
    "we judge this to be a better indicator than the soft - band log(@xmath34)log(@xmath35 ) due to the high , spatially variable neutral absorption column associated with the disc of m101 .",
    "a 4@xmath7 source detection threshold in the hard 26kev band corresponds to @xmath0 28 counts in both the pn and mos . after converting this into a 210kev flux for a typical faint agn ( @xmath8=1.4 , @xmath36 ) , and folding this through both the exposure map for the observation ( to correct for sensitivity changes across the epic field - of - view ) and the 210kev log(@xmath34)log(@xmath35 ) ,",
    "we predict a total contamination of @xmath0 18 background agn in the pn data and @xmath0 24 in the mos .",
    "sources # 1 & 104 have been optically identified as background galaxies in the _ rosat  _ survey of hard sources of @xcite .",
    "we note that source # 104 is one of the bright sources analysed in paper i ( xmm-5 ) , where we omitted this optical identification as a broad - line agn .",
    "it showed a composite x - ray spectrum comprised of a power - law plus a mekal thermal plasma , and we discussed the possibility that it was an xrb associated with m101 based on its positional coincidence with the end of a spiral arm and short- and long - term variability .",
    "however , these properties are also consistent with this source being a background galaxy with a thermal component from e.g. a supernova - driven galactic wind .",
    "a further five candidate agn / background galaxies have also been identified by @xcite based on the colours of optical counterparts , although two of these ( # 10 & 94 ) are not significantly detected in the hard 26kev band .",
    "in addition , an interarm sources ( # 66 ) with hard x - ray colours has a radio counterpart , which points to it being a background radio galaxy .    in total , fifty - four sources are significantly detected ( @xmath37 ) in the hard 2 - 6kev band . from an inspection of the positions of these sources with respect to optical dss and images , approximately half are coincident with star forming regions or spiral arm structure , arguing that they are associated with m101 .",
    "the remaining sources are the best candidates for background agn , and are either interarm or sources located away from the main body of m101 .",
    "this number is consistent with the number of background sources we expect based on the statistical arguments given above .",
    "the majority of the hard sources fall into the xrb and absorbed source categories in the x - ray colour classification scheme .",
    "it is interesting to note that in figure  [ fig : im_nh ] ( top ) , while the thermal snr candidate sources ( plotted in red ) correlate well with the structure , many of the absorbed sources ( plotted in blue ) fall into interarm regions .",
    "the column in m101 ranges from @xmath38 in the interarm regions to @xmath39 in the spiral arms @xcite , which implies that interarm absorbed sources with @xmath40 must possess absorption in excess of that in the disc of m101 , indicating that they are likely to be background galaxies .",
    "we note that the only source in the background source class to be significantly detected in the hard band is # 29 .",
    "however , apart from the some sss candidates that lie in this region ( see section  [ sec : sss ] ) , the remaining source classifications are ambiguous , as they are all borderline between the background source / xrb / snr categories , with error bars that overlap these categories , and therefore can not be firmly classified with this data .",
    "the x - ray colours show that a large proportion of the _ xmm  _ sources ( @xmath0 60 per cent ) have spectral shapes consistent with xrbs .",
    "however , not all of these sources are associated with m101 itself .",
    "again , from an inspection of the source locations with respect to the optical and images , we estimate that approximately half are associated with star - forming regions or spiral arm structure .",
    "as shown above in section  [ sec : agn ] , the majority of background agn candidates also have x - ray colours in the same spectral range , and constitute the main contaminant in this category . indeed , both of the optically identified background galaxies ( # 1 & 104 ) , plus two of the five agn candidates of @xcite fall into this category .",
    "in addition , absorbed or nonthermal emission from snrs may also fall in this spectral range on the x - ray colour diagram .",
    "our detailed spectral and timing analyses of the fourteen brightest sources in this field in paper i allows us to investigate the robustness of this classification scheme .",
    "eleven of the fourteen sources are classed as xrbs in this scheme , which agrees with our interpretation ( based on spectral shape and variability ) of ten being high - state xrbs , and one being a ( now identified ) background agn ( # 104/xmm-5 ) .",
    "the three exceptions are xmm-7 , xmm-11 & xmm-13 , which fall into the thermal snr range .",
    "however , this can be understood because their spectra were generally soft ; xmm-7 is a sss and xmm-11 and xmm-13 both have strong soft components in their spectra .",
    "this demonstrates that there is an overlap region between true snrs and soft xrbs .    additional evidence that the sources in this category are accreting systems comes from our detection of short - term variability during the _ xmm  _ observation .",
    "of the sixteen sources found to have statistical short - term variability at greater than the 95 per cent level , twelve fall into the xrb category .",
    "the remaining four fall into the snr category ; however these are all sources separately identified as either stars or soft xrbs where variability on this timescale is expected ( see section  [ sec : snr ] )",
    ".      snrs generally have soft thermal x - ray spectra with the majority of their flux below 2kev ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "fifteen sources fall into the snr category in the x - ray colour classification scheme , although four show short - term x - ray variability that we would not expect to detect from snrs .",
    "however , these four are all separately identified either as stars ( # 25 & 105 ) or bright soft xrbs ( # 74/xmm-11 [ coincident with snr mf83 ] & # 77/xmm-13 ) .    of the eleven non - variable sources in this category , one is a star ( # 21 ) , another is a bright soft xrb ( # 108/xmm-7 ) and three are optically identified agn candidates ( # 10 , # 85 & 94 , see section  [ sec : agn ] ) .",
    "three are unidentified sources ( # 32 , # 75 & 84 ) , although two of these ( # 32 & 75 ) are in in the vicinity of outer spiral arms in areas not covered by the optical survey of @xcite , and therefore stand as promising new candidate x - ray snrs .",
    "further optical / radio observations will be required to confirm their identifications .",
    "the remaining three sources are consistent with the positions of known snrs / radio sources .",
    "the _ xmm  _ position of source # 44 is consistent with that of sn1970 g in the giant region ngc  5455 , but in the absence of a more accurate _",
    "chandra  _ position to confirm this association , it is possible that the x - ray emission we detect with _ xmm  _ may be confused with other sources in the region where it resides .",
    "however , the _ chandra  _ position of source # 67 shows that it is firmly associated with snr mf65 , with positions matching to within @xmath0 1 arcsecond .",
    "in addition , the _ chandra  _ position of source # 87 matches one of six radio sources detected by @xcite in the giant region ngc  5462 .",
    "the authors do not classify this source as a snr as it was only detected at 20 cm and hence has no measured spectral index . even though we may just be detecting thermal x - ray emission from the region itself , this source does show a factor of @xmath41 long - term decrease in x - ray luminosity between the _ rosat  _ observations in 1992/1996 , the _",
    "chandra  _ observation in 2000 and the _ xmm  _ observation in 2002 , giving additional evidence that it may be a cooling snr .",
    "interestingly , this is one of the two sources that has a significant x - ray colour change between the _",
    "chandra  _ and _ xmm  _ observations , moving from the xrb to the snr category with decreasing luminosity .",
    "this indicates that this source may be a recent supernova , with the colour change attributable to thermal source cooling .",
    "in addition , there are two _",
    "xmm  _ sources that do not have snr x - ray colours , but which do have snr optical counterparts .",
    "source # 40 matches mf22 ( @xmath0 1.7 arcsecond offset ) , but falls into the xrb category . although snrs dominated by nonthermal emission ( i.e. crab - like snr ) will have harder x - ray spectra than thermal snrs , we must bear in mind that xrbs and snrs may in fact be spatially coincident , as both are the end products of massive stars and will tend to be located in star - forming regions .",
    "the other source ( # 46/xmm-1 ) demonstrates this point , as it is coincident with a snr ( mf37 ) although the spectral and timing properties of this source presented in paper i show that it is an xrb .",
    "ssss have been detected in a number of galaxies ( e.g. m31 , @xcite ; m81 , @xcite ; m83 , @xcite ) as well as m101 itself @xcite .",
    "they were classically defined as x - ray sources with effective temperatures of @xmath15 100ev , consistent with nuclear burning on the surface of white dwarfs accreting at high rates ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite have extended this definition to include sources with either blackbody type spectra with @xmath42ev , or power - law spectra with @xmath43 , with less than 10 per cent of the total x - ray luminosity above 1.5kev .",
    "this extended class is likely to represent a heterogeneous group including additional objects such as snrs , accreting neutron stars or possibly even accreting intermediate - mass black holes @xcite . for the majority of the sources in this _",
    "xmm  _ observation , we do not know the detailed spectral shapes of the sources , but we can identify candidate ssss if emission is only detected in the softest ( 0.31kev ) energy band .",
    "the x - ray colour diagrams ( figure  [ fig : xcolours ] ) show that 15 sources ( marked with stars ) fall into this category , with significant detections above 3@xmath7 _ only _ in the soft band in either the pn and/or mos data ( # 24 , 31 , 38 , 43 , 53 , 56 , 58 , 62 , 69 , 71 , 79 , 80 , 91 , 95 & 100 ) .",
    "simulations in xspec show that a 175ev blackbody epic ( pn+mos ) spectrum would have approximate hardness ratio values of hr1=-0.66 and hr2=-0.98 , and the candidate ssss hardness ratios are consistent with this , although as expected their hard hr2 colours are mostly unconstrained .",
    "we can discount source # 56 as a sss candidate as it is positionally coincident with a foreground star ( see section  [ sec : stars ] ) , but four sources ( # 53 , 58 , 71 & 100 ) are firmly associated with optically identified regions and the remainder generally lie on or near spiral arm structures as shown in the map in figure  [ fig : im_nh ] ( top ) . no short - term variability is detected in any of these sources , but long - term variability is evident in sources # 24 , 43 , 53 , 58 , 71 , 91 & 100 .",
    "four _ xmm  _ sources are positionally coincident with gsc stars ( # 3 , 25 , 56 & 105 ) , and optical counterparts for an additional two ( # 21 & 78 ) have been identified as stars by @xcite .",
    "stars have soft thermal x - ray spectra , and the x - ray colours of sources # 3 , 21 & 56 are consistent with this , lying at the soft end of the absorbed , snr and sss categories respectively .",
    "in contrast , source # 78 has a harder x - ray colour equivalent to @xmath44 and falls into the xrb category . given that this source was only detected by the pspc in the _ rosat  _ observations and hence had large positional errors , it is feasible that it was mistakenly associated with a star - like optical counterpart by @xcite .",
    "xmm  _ position of this source places it in an outer spiral arm of m101 near an region , and the x - ray properties make it more likely that this source is an xrb in m101 itself .",
    "the remaining two sources are among the brightest x - ray sources in this field ( # 25=gsc1275 & # 105=gsc1069/[ag79 ] 10 ) , and both have sufficient counts for spectral fitting .",
    "we have confirmed their identifications as stars ( as opposed to background agn ) by fitting their _",
    "xmm  _ spectra in xspec v11.3 with a power - law model typically fit to agn spectra , and mekal thermal plasma models which describe coronal emission from solar - type stars .",
    "the brightest source ( # 25 ) has a soft x - ray spectrum , with an x - ray flux of 1.1@xmath45 .",
    "it is poorly fit with a power - law model ( @xmath46=225/114 ) , and the slope of @xmath8=6.6 is too steep for most agn ( typically @xmath47 , @xcite ) .",
    "it is , however , well fit with a two - temperature plasma ( @xmath48=0.37/1.01kev , @xmath46=114/111 ) with abundances of @xmath00.2z@xmath49 , consistent with the temperatures and metallicities found in solar - type k - type stars @xcite .",
    "the light curve of this source also displays a classical flare with an exponential decay ( see figure  [ fig : lcurve ] , top ) , often seen in active k stars @xcite .",
    "the second source ( # 105 ) has an x - ray flux of 4.3@xmath50 , and is similarly well fit with a two - temperature plasma ( @xmath48=0.27/1.05kev , @xmath46=36/38 ) assuming abundances of @xmath00.3z@xmath49 ( leaving this parameter free resulted in unrealistically low values of @xmath51z@xmath49 ) .",
    "this time , the power - law fit is statistically acceptable ( @xmath46=46/39 ) , but the slope of @xmath8=4.9 is again too steep for the vast majority of agn .",
    "this source is also variable at @xmath52 ( see figure  [ fig : lcurve ] , bottom ) .",
    "in this paper we have studied the properties of the x - ray point source population of m101 as seen with _",
    "xmm - newton_. we detect 108 x - ray sources within the 25 ellipse of m101 , with fluxes ranging between 3.1@xmath534.2@xmath45 corresponding to luminosities of 1.9@xmath542.6@xmath55 in the 0.36kev energy range at the distance of m101 .",
    "we have studied the x - ray colour and variability characteristics of these sources , and have supplemented the _",
    "xmm  _ dataset with two archival _",
    "chandra  _ observations in order to search for flux and spectral changes .",
    "the main results can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "multiwavelength cross - correlations show that 20 sources are coincident with regions and/or snrs , 7 have identified / candidate background agn / galaxy counterparts , 6 are coincident with foreground stars and one has a radio counterpart .",
    "the remaining 74 are x - ray detections only",
    "the sources are distributed among the x - ray colour source categories as follows : 62 xrbs , 15 snrs , 11 absorbed sources , 5 background sources and 15 candidate ssss ( those only detected significantly in the soft 0.31kev band ) .",
    "we estimate that @xmath0 24 sources are background sources .",
    "two sources are optically identified as background galaxies , one of which is the bright source xmm-5 from paper i. a further five candidates background objects have been identified in the _ rosat  _ study of m101 @xcite .",
    "4 .   approximately 60 per cent of the sources have x - ray colours consistent with xrbs .",
    "we estimate that half are associated with regions or spiral arm structure , with background agn being the main contaminant in this category as they have similar spectral shapes .",
    "fifteen sources have x - ray colours consistent with snr .",
    "two correlate with the positions of known snrs , and another with a radio source in the giant region ngc  5462 .",
    "two sources are promising new candidate x - ray snrs , one is unidentified , while the other nine are identified as stars , soft xrbs and agn candidates .",
    "6 .   of the 15 sources with significant detections in the softest x - ray band ( 0.31kev ) ,",
    "14 are candidate ssss ; four are firmly associated with regions and the remainder generally lie on or near spiral arm structure . the other source is coincident with a foreground star . 7 .",
    "four _ xmm  _ sources are coincident with gsc stars , two of which are among the brightest x - ray sources in the field . optical counterparts for an additional two sources have been identified as stars by @xcite , although one shows harder x - ray colours than expected for a star and may be an xrb located in a spiral arm .",
    "sixteen sources are found to be significantly ( @xmath5 95 per cent ) variable during the _ xmm - newton  _ observation .",
    "twelve of these fall into the xrb category , giving additional evidence that they are accreting systems .",
    "the remaining four fall into the snr category ; however these are all sources separately identified as either stars or soft xrbs .",
    "9 .   using archival _",
    "chandra  _ and _ rosat  _ data , we find that 44 ( @xmath0 40 per cent ) _",
    "xmm  _ sources show long - term variability over a baseline of up to @xmath0 10 years .",

    "we have shown that the x - ray colour scheme of @xcite , adapted for the _ xmm  _ epic instruments , can be a useful guide for source classification , and so can give valuable insights into the overall source population in a spiral galaxy .",
    "however , we also demonstrate that there are undoubtedly overlap regions in the colour - colour diagram due to the similar spectral shapes of sources of different natures .",
    "for example , soft xrbs may have colours equivalent to thermal snrs , and background agn can have colours in the same range as xrb systems .",
