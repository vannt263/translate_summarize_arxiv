    "it is widely believed that self - gravitating accretion discs can form around supermassive black holes in agns .",
    "theoretical models show that the agn accretion discs must become self - gravitating if they extend beyond a fraction of a parsec away from a central black hole ( paczynski 1978 , kolykhalov and sunyaev 1980 , schlosman and begelman 1987 , kumar 1999 , jure 1999 , goodman 2002 ) .",
    "self - gravitating discs are unstable to fragmentation on a dynamical timescale ; self - gravity of agn accretion discs is a major issue in understanding how gas is delivered to the central black hole .",
    "it is likely that star formation will occur in the outer parts of an agn accretion disc ( kolykhalov and sunyaev 1980 , schlosman and begelman 1987 ) .",
    "recently , some supporting evidence for this process was obtained from observations of stellar velocities in our galactic center .",
    "levin and beloborodov ( 2003 , lb ) have analyzed the 3-d velocity data of genzel et .",
    "al .  ( 2000 ) , and have found that @xmath0 percent of massive stars from the sample move in a thin disc around the sgra * black hole .",
    "lb s finding was confirmed by genzel et .",
    "al .  ( 2003 ) , who have used the most recent data from ott et .",
    "al .  ( 2003 ) .",
    "genzel et .",
    "2003 ) have also found evidence for a second disc of stars which has a larger radius and thickness than the disc in lb ; the relative orientation of the two discs is nearly orthogonal .",
    "lb have argued that the stellar disc is a remant of a dense self - gravitating accretion disc , much like what was already proposed by kolykhalov and sunyaev in 1980 for the circum - black - hole accretion discs in other galaxies ( we quote from kolykhalov and sunyaev s abstract :  the fragmentation would produce around the black hole a ring of gas and stars which would survive even after accretion onto the hole has ceased \" . )",
    "the idea for star formation in the disc around sgra * was originally proposed by morris et .",
    "al .  ( 1999 ) ; in their scenario the disc s self - gravity does not play a central role .",
    "instead , the compression of the disc material is achieved by radiation and wind pressure from the central engine .",
    "morris et .",
    "al .  ( 1999 ) have identified the circumnuclear ring as the most likely source of supply for the disc material . however , the circumnuclear ring is strongly misaligned with the disc found by lb and by genzel et .",
    "thus , it seems more likely that the gas in the disc would come from a disrupted molecular cloud on a plunging trajectory ( sanders 1998 )",
    ".    a disc of stars could also be the remnant of a tidally disrupted young stellar cluster ( gerhard 2001 , portegiese zwart , mcmillan , and gerhard 2003 , mcmillan and portegiese zwart 2003 ) .",
    "this scenario becomes more credible if the dense cluster core contains an intermediate - mass black hole ( hansen and milosavlevic , 2003 ) .",
    "the gravitational pull from the latter would allow the core to stay intact until it comes within @xmath1pc from the sgra * , where the massive stars are observed to reside .    both the disc fragmentation and disrupted cluster scenarios have implications for the dynamics of the galactic nuclei and may provide channels for producing bursts of gravitational waves detectable by lisa . in this paper we investigate the consequences of disc fragmentation .",
    "the dynamics of the fragmenting disc is strongly affected by the feedback energy input from the starburst .",
    "colliln and zahn ( 1999 ) have conjectured that the feedback from this star formation will prevent the accretion disc from becoming strongly self - gravitating .",
    "however , goodman ( 2003 ) has used general energy arguments to show that the feedback from star formation is insufficient to prevent an agn disc with the near - eddington accretion rate from becoming strongly self - gravitating at a distance of @xmath2pc from the central black hole .",
    "this is distinct from the case of galactic gas discs , for which there is evidence that the feedback from star formation protects them from their self - gravitaty .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the physics of the self - gravitating disc and make a semi - analytical estimate of the possible mass range of stars formed in such discs ( sections ii and iii ) .",
    "our principal conclusion is that the stars can be very massive , up to hundreds of solar masses .",
    "these massive stars evolve quickly and produce stellar - mass black holes as the end product of their evolution .",
    "goodman ( 2003 ) has mentioned the possibility that the agn disc is stabilized by feedback from accretion onto black holes embedded in the disc . in section iv , we investigate goodman s conjecture and study whether the feedback from accretion onto these black holes may indeed stabilize a disc around a supermassive black hole , thus helping to fuel bright agns .",
    "we find that if the embedded black holes are accreting at a super - eddington rate set by the bondi - hoyle formula , then the extra heating they provide may be able to stabilize the agn disc .",
    "however , if their acretion rate is no higher than the eddington limit , than the agn disc can not be stabilized against its own selfgravity , and one would need some other source of heating to make the disc stable .",
    "we then argue ( section v ) that the disc - born black hole interacts gravitationally with the accretion disc , and migrates inward on the timescale of @xmath3 years .",
    "the merger of the migrating black hole with the central black hole will produce gravitational waves .",
    "we show that for a broad range of agn accretion rates the final inspiral is unaffected by gas drag , and therefore the gravitational - wave signal should be detectable by lisa .",
    "the rate of these mergers is uncertain , but if even a fraction of a percent of the disc mass is converted into black holes which later merge with the central black hole , then lisa should detect monthly a signal from such a merger .",
    "the final inspiral may occur close to the equatorial plane of the central supermassive hole and is likely to follow a quasi - circular orbit , which would make the gravitational - wave signal distinct from those in other astrophysical merger scenarios .",
    "if the disc - born black hole is sufficiently massive , it will disrupt accretion flow in the disc during the final year of its inpiral , thus making an optical counterpart to the gravitational - wave signal .",
    "the importance of self - gravitating accretion discs in astrophysics has long been understood ( pazynsky 1978 , lin and pringle 1987 ) .",
    "it was conjectured that the turbulence generated by the gravitational ( toomre ) instability may act as a source of viscosity in the disc .",
    "this viscosity would both drive accretion and keep the disc hot ; the latter would act as a negative feedback for the toomre instability and would keep the disc only marginally unstable .",
    "recently , there has been big progress in our understanding of the self - gravitating discs , due to a range of new and sophisticated numerical simulations ( gammie 2001 , mayer et .",
    "2002 , rice et .",
    "2003 ) . in our analysis",
    ", we shall rely extensively on these recent numerical results .",
    "consider an accretion disc which is supplied by a gas infall . this situation may arise when a merger or some other major event in a galaxy delivers gas to the proximity of a supermassive black hole residing in the galactic bulge . let @xmath4 be the surface density of the disc .",
    "we follow the evolution of the disc as @xmath5 gradually increases due to the infall .",
    "we begin by assuming that initially there is no viscosity mechanism , like magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) , to transport the angular momentum and keep the disc hot .",
    "this assumption is valid when the ionization fraction of the gas in the disc is low , i.e.  when the gas is far enough from a central source ( about a thousand schwarzchild radii from the supermassive black hole ) .",
    "we also , for the time being , neglect irradiation from the central source ; this may be a good assumption if a disrupted molecular cloud forms a disc but the accretion onto the hole has not yet begun . as will be discussed below",
    ", irradiation is important for some regions in the agn discs we are considering .",
    "however , as shown in the following subsection , inclusion of irradiation or other source of heating will only strengthen the case for formation of massive stars .",
    "we assume , therefore , that the forming disc cools until it becomes self - gravitating ; this happens when @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the isothermal speed of sound at the midplane of the disc , and @xmath8 is the angular velocity of the disc .",
    "numerical simulations show that once the disc becomes self - gravitating , turbulence and shocks develop ; they transport angular momentum and provide heating which compensates the cooling of the disc ( gammie 2001 ) .",
    "we thus assume , in agreement with the simulations , that when the disc exists , it is marginally self - gravitating , i.e.   @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath10 and @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the temperature in the midplane of the disc , @xmath13 is the proton mass , and @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the one - sided flux from the disc surface is given by the modified stephan - boltzman law :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the effective temperature .",
    "it is related to the midplane temperature by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the optical depth of the disc ; here @xmath19 is the opacity of the disc .",
    "the function @xmath20 for an optically thin disc , and @xmath21 for an optically thick disc .",
    "we combine these two cases in our model by taking @xmath22 we have used eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) in the last step of eq .",
    "( [ trelation ] ) .",
    "the flux from the disc is powered by the accretion energy : @xmath23 here @xmath24 parametrizes viscous dissipation due to self - gravity ( gammie 2001 ) ; we have used eq .",
    "( [ c_s ] ) in the last step . using eqs ( [ flux1 ] ) , ( [ flux2 ] ) , and ( [ trelation ] )",
    ", we can express the viscosity parameter @xmath24 as @xmath25 it is very important to emphasize that in this model @xmath24 is only a function of @xmath26 and @xmath8 : the temperature in the midplane is determined by eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , and this temperature sets the opacity which in turn determines the optical depth @xmath18 .",
    "the opacity in the range of temperatures and densities of interest to us is set by light scattering off ice grains and , in some cases , by scattering off metal dust .",
    "the relevant regimes are worked out in the literature on protoplanetary discs ; we use the analytical fit to the opacity ( in @xmath27/gm ) from the appendix of bell and lin , 1994 .",
    "@xmath28 in the first interval the opacity is due to icegrains ; in the second interval the icegrains evaporate , and the opacity drops sharply with the temperature ; in the third interval ( the highest @xmath12 ) dust grains are the major source of the opacity . levin and matzner ( 2003 , in preparation )",
    "consider a more general temperature regime and use the available opacity tables instead of relying on the analytical fits .    from eq .",
    "( [ alpha1 ] ) we see that as @xmath26 of the disc increases due to the merger - driven infall , the effective viscosity will reach @xmath29 . at this stage the cooling time of",
    "the disc becomes comparable to the orbital period .",
    "gammie s simulations show that in this case the turbulence induced by self - gravity is no longer able to keep the disc together , and the disc fragments .",
    "gammie s simulations give @xmath30 ; the numerical value we quote disagrees with gammie s , but agrees with @xmath31 quoted by goodman ( 2003 ) since like goodman we use isothermal speed of sound for @xmath24-prescription .",
    "gammie s results , although obtained for razor - thin discs , justify the key assumption of our model : _ the disc exists as a whole for @xmath32 , and fragments once @xmath33_. similar criterion for the disc fragmentation was already used in shlosman and begelman , 1987 .",
    "we shall refer to the midplane temperature and surface density of the marginally fragmenting disc with @xmath33 as the critical temperature @xmath34 and the critical surface density , @xmath35 .",
    "we now find the critical surface density and midplane temperature as a function of @xmath8 .",

    "the critically self - gravitating disc is optically thin if the second term of the lhs of eq .",

    "( 4 ) of lin and papaloizou ( 1986 ) .",
    "once the gas is depleted from the disc , we expect the initial distribution of the clump masses to be concentrated between @xmath46 and @xmath48 .",

    "so far in determining the structure of the self - gravitating disc , we have neglected external or internal heating of the disc .",
    "this is certainly a poor approximation in many cases .",
    "irradiation from agn or surrounding stars , or feedback from star formation inside the disc can be the dominant source of heating of the outer parts of agn discs ( eg , shlosman and begelman 1987 , 1989 ) .",
    "for example , iradiation from circumnuclear stars will keep the disc temperature at a few tens of kelvin , which is higher than the critical temperature we obtained for a self - gravitating disc beyond @xmath1pc away from @xmath51 black hole .",
    "however , extra heating will always work to increase the critical temperature at which the disc fragmentation occurs .",
    "therefore , the values of the critical surface density @xmath52 , scaleheight @xmath53 , and the mass of the initial fragment @xmath54 obtained above should be treated as lower bounds of what might be expected around real agns or protostars .",
    "higher values of these quantities would only strengthen main conclusions of this paper .",
    "lb have found that when the rate of accretion @xmath55 is constant throughout the disc , the toomre mass @xmath46 is given by @xmath56 and that the gap - opening mass is @xmath57 here , @xmath58 is the black - hole mass , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the radius and the scaleheight of the disc .",
    "thus , even if the clumps do not merge with each other and stop their growth at the gap - opening mass , the mass of the formed stars will be biased towards the high - mass end . in the next section",
    "we discuss the effects of clump mergers and the mass range of stars born after the disc fragments .",

    "therefore , after the collapse commenses , the clump is not virialized while it is optically thin",
    ". the temperature can not be much smaller than @xmath67 , since otherwise the cooling rate would be much smaller than the rate of release of the gravitational binding energy , and the gas would heat up by quasi - adiabatic compression .",

    "( [ t1 ] ) should be substituted by an approximate equality , and therefore we have during optically - thin collapse @xmath69 the optical depth scales as @xmath70 and hence rises sharply as the clump s radius decreases ; as the clump shrinks it becomes optically thick .",
    "we suspect that in most cases the clump becomes optically thick before it subfragments , since the jean s mass has a slow dependence on the optical depth .",
    "however , only detailed numerical simulations can resolve these issues . ] .",
    "it is possible to show that once the clump is optically thick , it virializes quickly with it s temperature @xmath71 . for @xmath72 ( icegrains ) , the cooling time of an optically thick clump scales with the clump radius as @xmath73 the characteristic timescale for the clump to collide with another clump scales with the clump radius as @xmath74 from eqs .",
    "( [ tcool ] ) and ( [ tcoll ] ) , we see that the collision rate decreases less steeply than the coolling rate as a function of the radius of an optically thick clump .",
    "therefore , merger can be an efficient way of increasing the clump s mass .",
    "this conclusion is no longer valid when the temperature of the clump becomes larger than @xmath75k ; then the opacity is dominated by metal dust with @xmath76 . in this case",
    "the cooling time scales as @xmath77 .",
    "the collision timescale increases faster than the cooling time as the clump shrinks , and naively one would expect that mergers may not be efficient in growing the clump masses .",
    "however , we have neglected the rotational support within a clump .",
    "each clump is initially rotating with angular frequency comparable to the clump s inverse dynamical timescale ; for example , in a keplerian disc each clump s initial angular velocity is @xmath78 .",
    "therefore each clump will shrink and collapse into a rotationally supported disc , and the size of this disc is comparable to the size of the original clump ( this picture seems to be in agreement with gammie s simulations ) .",
    "thus rotational support generally slows down the collapse of an individual fragment and makes mergers between diferent fragments to be efficient .",
    "magnetic braking is one of the ways for the clump to lose its rotational support ( see , e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "one generally expects a horizontal magnetic field to be present in a differentially rotating disc due to the mri ( balbus and hawley , 1991 ) .",
    "ionization fraction in the disc is expected to be small , so the magnetic field is saturated at a subequipartition value @xmath79 , with @xmath80 .",
    "horizontal magnetic field will couple inner and outer parts of the differentially rotating clump on the alfven crossing timescale @xmath81 , and the collapse will proceed on this timescale as well .    what is the maximum mass that the clump can achieve ?",
    "this issue has been analyzed for the similar situation of a protoplanetary core accreting from a disc of planetesimals ( rafikov 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the growing clump can not accrete more mass than is present in it s `` feeding annulus '' .",
    "this gives the maximum `` isolation '' mass of a clump : @xmath82 where , as above , @xmath83 is the mass scale of the first clumps to form from a disc ; see , e.g. , eq .",
    "( 2 ) of rafikov ( 2001 ) .",
    "however , numerical work of ida and makino ( 1993 ) and analytical calculations of rafikov ( 2001 ) indicate that the isolation mass may be hard to reach .",
    "the consider a massive body moving on a circular orbit through a disc of gravitationally interacting particles , and they find that when the mass of the body exceeds some critical value , an annular gap is opened in the particle disc around the body s orbit .",
    "we can idealize a disc consisting of fragments as a disc of particles of a typical fragment mass @xmath84 .",
    "once a growing clump opens a gap in a disc of gravitationally interacting fragments , the clump s growth may become quenched .",
    "this gap - opening mass of the clump @xmath85 is given by eq .",

    "stars with masses of a few tens of solar masses will produce black holes as the end product of their rapid ( @xmath93yr ) evolution ; the characteristic mass of these black holes is believed to be around @xmath94 .",
    "a recent work by mirabel and rodrigues ( 2003 ) shows that the black holes whose projenitors have masses @xmath95 do not recieve a velocity kick at their birth .",
    "thus , the disc - born black holes are likely to remain embedded in the disc .",
    "once formed , the stellar - mass black holes will dramatically affect the dynamics of the agn disc .",
    "we assume that the disc is replenished due to continuous infall , and in this section we analyze a steady - state agn disc which is heated by the energy released due to the the accretion onto stellar - mass black holes embedded in the disc .",

    "in this model , the accretion rate for the embedded black home of mass @xmath100 is given by the bondi - hoyle formula , @xmath102 for the latter expression to be true , the bondi radius @xmath103 must be less than the scaleheight of the disc ; this condition will be checked once the structure of the disc is worked out .",

    "the eddington - limited accretion occurs on a timescale of @xmath131yr , much longer than the characteristic type - i inspiral time .",
    "thus , in this case the black holes do nt accrete much on their way in . on the other hand ,",
    "the bondi - hoyle formula predicts the mass e - folding timescale of a few hundred years .",
    "thus , if the black hole is allowed to accrete at the bondi - hoyle rate , its mass increases rapidly until it opens a gap in the disc . then , the inspiral proceeds via type - ii migration .    from eqs .",
    "( [ typeii ] ) and ( [ typei ] ) we see that the embedded black hole experiencing type - i or type - ii migration would merge with the central black hole on the timescale @xmath132@xmath133 years , shorter than the typical timescale of an agn activity .",
    "thus it is plausible that the daughter disc - born black hole is brought towards the parent central black hole ; the mass of the daughter black hole might grow significantly on the way in .",
    "gravitational radiation will eventually become the dominant mechanism driving the inspiral , and the final merger will produce copious amount of gravitational waves . in the next subsection",
    "we show that these waves are detectable by lisa for a broad range of the black hole masses and the disc accretion rate .",
    "it is realistic to expect that lisa would follow the last year of the inspiral of the disc - born black hole into the central black hole .",
    "generally , one must develop a set of templates which densely span the parameter space of possible inspiral signals . in order for the final inspiral to be detectable",
    ", one of the templates must follow the signal with the phaseshift between the two not exceeding a fraction of a cycle . therefore",
    ", if the drag from the disc will alter the waveform by a fraction of a cycle over the signal integration time ( e.g. , @xmath40 year ) , detection of the signal with high signal - to - noise ratio will become problematic .",
    "below we address the influence of the accretion disc on the final inpiral waveform .",
    "the issue of gas - drag influence on the lisa signal was first addressed by narayan ( 2000 ) ; see also chakrabarti ( 1996 ) .",
    "narayan s analysis is directly applicable to low - luminocity non - radiative quasi - spherical accretion flows , which might exist around supermassive black holes when the accretion rate is @xmath134 of the eddington limit .",
    "narayan concluded that non - radiative flows will not have any observable influence on the gravitational - wave signals seen by lisa .",
    "below we extend narayan s analysis to the case of radiative disc - like flows with high accretion rate , which are likely to be present in high - luminocity agns .",
    "consider a non - rotating central black hole of mass @xmath135 , accreting at a significant fraction @xmath136 of the eddington rate , @xmath108 .",
    "the accretion disc in the region of interest ( @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the schwartzchild radius of the central black hole ) is radiation - pressure dominated , and the opacity @xmath139 is due to the thompson scattering . by following the standard thin - disc theory ( shakura and sunyaev , 1973 ) ,",
    "we get @xmath140 where @xmath104 is the efficiency with which the accreted mass converts into radiation , and @xmath141 is the schwartzchild radius of the central black hole ; and @xmath142    the disc black hole in orbit around the central black hole excites density waves in the disc ( goldreich and tremaine , 1980 ) ; these waves carry angular momentum flux @xmath143 here , as before , @xmath100 is the mass of the orbiting disc black hole .",
    "ward ( 1987 ) has argued that the torque acting on the orbiting body is @xmath144 .",
    "we can compute the characteristic timescale for the orbit evolution due to the density - waves torque : @xmath145 one must compare @xmath146 to the timescale @xmath147 of orbital evolution due to gravitational - radiation - reaction tourque : @xmath148 here , @xmath149 is the time left before the disc and central holes merge , i.e.  the integration time for the lisa signal . optimistically we could expect to follow the lisa signal to @xmath1 of a cycle ( thorne 1999 ) . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath150 is less than unity , the disc drag does not impact detection of the final inspiral ; cf .",
    "( 16 ) of narayan ( 2000 ) . here",
    "@xmath151 is the number of cycles the disc black hole will make before merging with the central black hole .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ sigmabh ] ) , ( [ csbh ] ) , ( [ torquewaves ] ) , and ( [ tgw ] ) , we get @xmath152 where @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 . we see that for a large range of parameters @xmath156 , and the disc drag does not influence the inpiral signal .",
    "however , note that @xmath157 is a very sensitive function of @xmath136 and @xmath100 .",
    "for instance , the disc will influence significantly an inspiralling @xmath158 black hole when the accretion rate is down to a few percent of the eddington limit .",
    "one then needs to reduce the influence of the disc on the lisa signal by choosing to observe the smaller portion of the final inspiral , i.e.  by choosing a smaller integration time @xmath149 .",
    "there is another important source of drag experienced by the inpiralling black hole ; it was first analyzed by chakrabarti ( 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "generally , there is a radial pressure gradient in an accretion disc ; this pressure gradient makes the asimuthal velosity of the disc gas slightly different from a velocity of the test particle on a circular orbit at the same radius .",
    "therefore the inspiralling black hole will experience a head wind from a gas in the accretion disc ; by accreting gas from the disc the black hole will experience the braking torque which will make it lose it s specific angular momentum .",
    "this tourque is given by @xmath159 where @xmath160 is rate of accretion onto the inspiraling black hole from the disc , and @xmath161 is the speed of the headwind experienced by the black hole moving with the orbital speed @xmath162 .",
    "we assume that the inspiraling hole accretes with the bondi - hoyle rate , @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the density of the ambient disc gas . by using the last equation in eq .",
    "( [ tauwind ] ) , we obtain the expression for the tourque @xmath165 , which turns out to be the same as the tourque from the density waves , up to the numerical factor between @xmath40 and @xmath166 .",
    "we see therefore that inclusion of chakrabarti s `` accretion '' torque is important for the detailed analysis , but does not qualitatively change our conclusions",
    ".    can the orbiting black hole open a gap in the disc during it s final inspiral ? in order to overcome the viscous stresses which oppose opening the gap , the mass of the orbiting black hole should be greater than the threshold value given by eq .",
    "( [ mbhgap ] ) .",
    "the radius @xmath167 from which the inspiral begins is given by @xmath168 and the scaleheight of the disc is radius - independent in the radiation - dominated inner region ( this is true only if you treat the central black hole as a newtonian object ) : @xmath169 the gap will be open in the disc , therefore , if the mass of the inspiraling black hole exceeds @xmath170 during the final year of merger of the @xmath94 disc - born black hole and the @xmath171 central black hole , the gap will be open if the accretion rate onto the central black hole is about five percent of the eddington limit .",
    "such gap - opening merger can result in sudden changes in the agn luminosity and produce an optical counterpart to the gravitational - wave signal .",
    "the details of black - hole formation and evolution in the disc are uncertain , and it seems impossible to make a reliable estimate of an event rate for lisa from this channel of black - hole mergers .",
    "nonetheless , from eq  ( [ ratiovalue ] ) we see that in order for an extended accretion disc in a bright agn to be stable , a significant mass fraction of the material acreted by the cental black hole must go into the stellar - mass black holes embedded in the disc .",
    "it is worth working through a simple example to show that the merger of disc - born holes with the central hole may be an important source for lisa .",
    "studies of integrated light coming from galactic nuclei show that the supermassive black holes acquire significant part and perhaps almost all of their mass via accretion of gas ; see , e.g. , yu and tremaine ( 2002 ) and references therein .",
    "assume , for the sake of our example , that a mass fraction @xmath172 of this gas is converted into @xmath158 black holes on the way in , and that all of these black holes eventually merge with the central black hole .",
    "lisa can detect such mergers to @xmath173 if the central black hole is between @xmath174 and @xmath133 solar masses ( one needs to assume that the central black hole is rapidly rotating at the high - mass end of this range ) .",
    "the mass density of such black holes in the local universe is @xmath175 ( salucci et .",
    "al .  1999 ) .",
    "we can estimate , using figure @xmath176 of pei et .",
    "1995 ) , that about @xmath166 percent of integrated radiation from galactic nuclei comes from redshifts accessible to lisa , @xmath177 .",
    "this implies that supermassive black holes acquired @xmath166 percent of their mass at @xmath177 .",
    "we shall therefore assume that @xmath166 percent of the mass of the black holes in lisa mass range was accreted at @xmath177 .",
    "this implies that there were @xmath178 mergers per mpc@xmath179 which are potentially detectable by lisa .",
    "when we multiply this by volume out to @xmath173 and divide it by the hubble time , we get an estimate of the lisa event rate from such mergers , @xmath180 the estimate above should be treated as an illustration of importance for our channel of the mergers , rather than as a concrete prediction for lisa .",
    "currently , it is not known how to compute well the gravitational waveform produced by an inpiral with an arbitrary eccentricity and inclination relative to the central black hole .",
    "this might pose a great challenge to the lisa data analysis .",
    "indeed , in the currently popular astrophysical scenario , the stellar - mass black hole gets captured on a highly eccentric orbit with arbitrary inclination relative to the central black hole ( siggudrson and rees , 1997 ) . by contrast , in our scenario the inpiral occurs in the equatorial plane , and the signal is well understood ( hughes 2001 and references therein ) . hence the template for detection is readily available , and the merger channel we consider has a clear observational signature which distinguishes it from other channels . it is an open question whether the inpiraling hole can acquire high eccentricity by ineracting with the disc or with other orbiting masses ( goldreich and sari 2003 , chiang et .",
    "al .  2002 ) ; it seems likely that at least in some cases interaction with the disc will act to circularize the orbit .",
    "finn and thorne ( 2000 ) have performed a detailed census of parameter space for circular - orbit inspirals as seen by lisa .",
    "in this paper , we rely on numerical simulations by gammie ( 2001 ) to develop a formalism for self - gravitating thin discs which are gaining mass by continuous infall .",
    "we present a way to calculate the critical temperature , surface density , and scaleheigh of the disc just prior to fragmentation .",
    "our formalism naturally includes both optically thin and optically thick discs .",
    "we then speculate on the outcome of the nonlinear physical processes which follow fragmentation : accretion and merger of smaller fragments into bigger ones .",
    "we find an upper bound on the mass of final , merged fragments , and we give a plausibility argument that some fragments will indeed reach this upper bound .",
    "we thus predict that very massive stars of tens or even hundreds of solar masses will be produced in self - gravitating discs around supermassive black holes .",
    "the end product of fast evolution of these massive stars will be stellar - mass black holes .",
    "finally , we make an argument that the disc - born black holes in agns find a way to merge with central black holes .",
    "we consider a purely toy - model example of what the rate of such mergers might be , as seen by lisa ; we illustrate this rate might be high enough to be interesting for future gravitational - wave ( gw ) observations .",
    "the gw signal from this merger channel is distinct from that of other channels , and can be readily modeled using our current theoretical understanding of the final stages of the inspiral driven by gravitational - radiation reaction .",
    "we show that for a broad range of accretion rates and black - hole masses the drag from accretion disc will not be large enough to pollute the signal and make inspiral template invalid . in some cases , the inspiralling hole will open a gap in the accretion disc close to the central black hole , thus producing a possible optical counterpart for the gravitational - wave burst generated by the merger .",
    "i have greatly benefited from discussions with chris matzner throughout this project . he has suggested the model for the heated disc in section iv , and has independently verified the formulae in that section .",
    "matzner has graciously declined to be a co - author of this paper .",
    "i have learned a lot about accretion discs from eliot quataert . after the bulk of this project",
