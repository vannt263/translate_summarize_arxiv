    "realization of a quantum computer would be very important for the solution of hard problems in classical mathematics @xcite and even more important for the solution of many quantum problems in field theory , quantum chemistry , material physics , etc.@xcite however , despite a large effort of many groups the realization remains far away because of the conflicting requirements imposed by scalability and decoupling from the environment .",
    "this dichotomy can be naturally resolved by the error free computation in the topologically protected space @xcite if the physical systems realizing such spaces are identified and implemented . though difficult",
    ", this seems more realistic than attempts to decouple simple physical systems implementing individual bits from the environment .",
    "thus , the challenge of the error free quantum computation   resulted in a surge of interest to physical systems and mathematical models that were considered very exotic before .",
    "the main idea of the whole approach , due to kitaev @xcite , is that the conditions of long decoherence rate and scalability can be in principle satisfied if elementary bits are represented by anyons , the particles that indergo non - trivial transformations when moved adiabatically around each other ( braided )  @xcite and that can not be distinguished by local operators .",
    "one of the most famous examples of such excitations is provided by the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "the difficult part is , of course , to identify a realistic physical system that has such excitations and allows their manipulations . to make it more manageable",
    ", this problem should be separated into different layers .",
    "the bottom layer is the physical system itself , the second is the theoretical model that identifies the low energy processes , the third is the mathematical model that starts with the most relevant low energy degrees of freedom and gives the properties of anyons while the fourth deals with construction of the set of rules on how to move the anyons in order to achieve a set of universal quantum gates ( further lies the layer of algorithms and so on ) .",
    "ideally , the study of each layer should provide the one below it a few simplest alternatives and the one above the resulting properties of the remaining low energy degrees of freedom .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the third layer : we discuss a particular set of mathematical models that provides anyon excitations , namely the chern simons gauge theories with the discrete gauge groups .",
    "generally , an appealing realization of the anyons is provided by the fluxes in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "@xcite . the idea is to encode individual bits in the value of fluxes belonging to the same conjugacy class of the gauge group : such fluxes can not be distinguished locally because they are transformed one into another by a global gauge transformation and would be even completely indistiguishable in the absence of other fluxes in the system .",
    "alternatively , one can protect anyons from the adverse effect of the local operators by spreading the fluxes over a large region of space . in this case",
    "one does not need to employ a non - abelian group : the individual bits can be even encoded by the presence / absence of flux in a given area , for instance a large hole in the lattice .",
    "such models @xcite are much easier to implement in solid state devices but they do not provide a large set of manipulation that would be sufficient for universal quantum computation .",
    "thus , these models provide a perfect quantum memory but not a quantum processor . on the other hand",
    ", the difficulty with the flux representation is that universal computation can be achieved only by large non - abelian groups ( such as @xmath1 ) that are rather difficult to implement , or if one adds charge motion to the allowed set of manipulations .",
    "because the charges form a non - trivial representation of the local gauge group , it is difficult to protect their coherence in the physical system which makes the latter alternative also difficult to realize in physical systems . the last alternative is to realize a chern - simons model where on the top of the conjugacy transformations characteristic of non - abelian theories , the fluxes acquire non - trivial phase factors when moved around each other .",
    "we explore this possibility in this paper .",
    "chern - simons theories with finite non - abelian gauge groups have been extensively studied for a continuous @xmath2 dimensional space - time . unlike continous gauge - group , discrete groups on a continous space allow non - trivial fluxes only around cycles which can not be contracted to a single point .",
    "so in a path - integral approach , and by contrast to the case of continuous groups , the integration domain is restricted to gauge - field configurations for which the local flux density vanishes everywhere .",
    "such path integrals were introduced , analyzed , and classified in the original paper by dijkgraaf and witten  @xcite .",
    "they showed that for a given finite gauge group @xmath3 , all possible chern - simons actions in @xmath2 dimensions are in one to one correspondence with elements in the third cohomology group @xmath4 of @xmath3 with coefficients in @xmath5 .",
    "they also provided a description in terms of a @xmath2 lattice gauge theory , where space - time is tiled by tetrahedra whose internal states are described by just three independent group elements @xmath6 because fluxes through all triangular plaquettes vanish .",
    "elements of @xmath4 are then identified with functions that play the role of the elementary action for a tetrahedron .",
    "this description turns out to be rather cumbersome because does not have specific symmetry properties , so that the definition of the total action requires to choose an ordering for all the lattice sites , which can not be done in a natural way . as a result",
    ", it seems very difficult to take the limit of a continuous time that is necessary for our purposes because physical implementations always require an explicit hamiltonian form .    in principle , the knowledge of an elementary action @xmath7 in @xmath4 allows to derive all braiding properties of anyonic excitations ( i.e. local charges and fluxes ) .",
    "this has been done directly from the original path - integral formulation  @xcite , using as an intermediate step the representation theory of the so - called quasi - quantum double associated to the group @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this mathematical struture is completely defined by the group @xmath3 and a choice of any element @xmath7 in @xmath4 . using this later formalism , which bypasses the need to construct microscopic hamiltonians ,",
    "many detailed descriptions of anyonic properties for various finite groups , such as direct products of cyclic groups , or dihedral groups , have been given by de wild propitius  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these general results do not provide a recipe how to contruct a microscopic hamiltonian with prescribed braiding properties .    to summarize , in spite of a rather large body of theoretical knowledge , we still do not know which chern - simons models with a finite gauge group can _ in principle _ be realized in a physical system with a local hamiltonian , that is which one can appear as low energy theory . to answer",
    "this question is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "the main ingredients of our construction are the following .",
    "we shall be mostly interested in a hilbert space spanned by _",
    "dilute _ classical configurations of fluxes because it is only these configurations that are relevant for quantum computation that involves flux braiding and fusion .",
    "furthermore , we expect that a finite spacial separation between fluxons may facilitate various manipulations and measurements .",
    "notice in this respect that in theories with discrete group symmetry in a continuous space@xcite , non - trivial fluxes appear only thanks to a non - trivial topology of the ambiant space  @xcite and thus are restricted to large well separated holes in a flat 2d space .",
    "the second feature of our construction is that gauge generators are modified by phase - factors which depend on the actual flux configuration in a local way .",
    "this is a natural generalization of the procedure we have used recently for the construction of chern - simons models with @xmath8 symmetry group  @xcite .",
    "note that in the most general situations , the representation of the local gauge group in a discrete chern - simons theory becomes _ projective _",
    "this would be inappropriate for a robust implementation because projective representations lead to degenerate multiplets that are strongly coupled to local operators , and therefore become very fragile in the presence of external noise .",
    "we shall therefore restrict ourselves to the models were no projective representations occur .",
    "in practice , they are associated with the non - trivial elements of the group @xmath9 , and it turns out that for some interesting classes of groups such as the dihedral groups @xmath10 with @xmath11 odd , @xmath9 is trivial  @xcite , so this restriction is not too important . as we show in section  [ sectiongenerators ] , these assumptions allow us to find all the possible phase factors associated with the gauge transformations in terms of homomorphisms from the subgroups of @xmath3 that leave invariant a fixed element of @xmath3 under conjugacy into @xmath5 . the last step is to construct a set of local gauge - invariant operators corresponding to the following elementary processes : moving a single fluxon , creating or annihilating a pair of fluxons with vacuum quantum numbers , and branching processes were two nearby fluxons merge into a single one ( or conversely ) .",
    "we shall see that the requirement of local gauge invariance leads to a relatively mild constraint for the possible phase - factors , leaving a rather large set of solutions .",
    "the main result of this work is twofold .",
    "first , we provide an explicit computation of holonomy properties of fluxes in a set a models based on dihedral groups . of special interest",
    "is the simplest of them , @xmath12 which is also the permutation group of 3 elements @xmath13 .",
    "this group belongs to a class which is in principle capable of universal quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "this part is therefore connected to the upper layer ( designing a set of univeral gates from properties of anyons ) in the classification outlined above .",
    "but our construction of a local hamiltonian version for a chern - simons model on a lattice provides some guidelines for possible desirable physical implementations .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "section ii is mostly pedagogical , providing the motivation for our general construction through the simplest example of a chern - simons gauge theory , namely the non - compact @xmath5 model . in section iii",
    "we formulate general conditions on local chern - simons phase factors that satisfy gauge invariance conditions . in section",
    "iv we discuss the construction of the electric field operator and derive condition on the phase factor that allows one a gauge invariant fluxon dynamics . in section v we discuss the fluxon braiding properties and derive the chern - simons phase factors associated with the braiding . in section",
    "vi we apply our results to the simplest non - abelian groups @xmath0 .",
    "finally , section vii gives conclusions .",
    "some technical points relevant for the general construction have been relegated to appendix a , and appendix b discusses some interesting features of the torus geometry .",
    "although this geometry is not easy to implement in experiments , it is conceptually very interesting since it is the simplest example of a two - dimensional space without boundary and with topologically non - trivial closed loops .",
    "to motivate the construction of the present paper , it is useful to discuss some important features of chern - simons gauge theories in the simpler case of abelian groups . for this purpose",
    ", we shall consider here as an illustration the model based on the _ continuous _ abelian group with one generator in its non - compact version .",
    "of course , our main purpose here is to address _ finite _ groups , but as we shall discuss , this non - compact @xmath5 model contains already the key ingredients . on a @xmath2 dimensional space - time",
    ", it is defined from the following lagrangian density : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the local magnetic field ( a pseudo - scalar in @xmath2 dimensions ) and dots stand for time - derivatives .",
    "we have used the gauge in which the time component @xmath16 of the vector potential is zero . because of this , we shall consider only invariance under time - independent gauge transformations in this discussion .",
    "these are defined as usual by , where @xmath17 is any time - independent smooth scalar function of spacial position .",
    "under such a gauge transformation , the action associated to the system evolution on a two - dimensional space manifold @xmath18 during the time interval @xmath19 $ ] varies by the amount @xmath20 where : @xmath21 because @xmath22 is time - independent , the integrand is a total time - derivative , so we may write , where @xmath23 denotes the field configuration at time @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and : @xmath26 in the case where @xmath18 has no boundary ( and in particular no hole ) , we may integrate by parts and get : @xmath27 when @xmath28 , this modifies in a non - trivial way the behavior of the corresponding quantized model under time - independent gauge transformations . one way to see",
    "this is to consider the time - evolution of the system s wave - functional @xmath29 . in a path - integral approach , the probability amplitude to go from an initial configuration @xmath30 at time @xmath31 to a final @xmath32 at time @xmath33",
    "is given by : @xmath34 where fields @xmath35 are required to satisfy boundary conditions for @xmath36 .",
    "after the gauge - transformation , and using the above expression for @xmath20 , we see that the probability amplitude connecting the transformed field configurations @xmath37 and @xmath38 is : @xmath39 it is therefore natural to define the gauge - transformed wave - functional @xmath40 by : @xmath41 this definition ensures that @xmath29 and @xmath42 evolve according to the same set of probability amplitudes .",
    "in a hamiltonian formulation , we associate to any classical field configuration @xmath43 a basis state @xmath44 .",
    "the gauge - transformation corresponding to @xmath22 is now represented by a unitary operator @xmath45 defined by : @xmath46 the presence of the phase - factor is one of the essential features of the chern - simons term ( i.e. the term proportional to @xmath47 ) added to the action . note that when @xmath22 varies , the family of operators @xmath45 gives rise to a representation of the full group of local gauge transformations .",
    "indeed , at the classical level , the composition law in this group is given by the addition of the associated @xmath22 functions , and because @xmath48 given in eq .",
    "( [ iwithoutboundary ] ) is itself gauge - invariant , we have .",
    "it is interesting to give an explicit expression for @xmath45 .",
    "it reads : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the canonically conjugated variables to @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "note that this no longer holds in the case of a manifold @xmath18 with a boundary , as will be discussed in a few paragraphs .    in the hamiltonian quantization , a very important role",
    "is played by the gauge - invariant electric operators @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the absence of chern - simons term , they are simply equal to @xmath50 and @xmath51 . when @xmath28 , because of eq .",
    "( [ explicitu(f ) ] ) , the transformation law for @xmath50 and @xmath51 becomes : @xmath56 to compensate for this new gauge sensitivity of conjugated momenta , the gauge - invariant electric field becomes : @xmath57 any classical gauge - invariant lagrangian gives rise , after legendre transformation , to a hamiltonian which is a functional of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath58 fields .",
    "if we add the chern - simons term to the original lagrangian and perform the legendre transformation , we get a new hamiltonian which is expressed in terms of the new gauge - invariant @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath58 fields through the _ same _ functional as without the chern - simons term . for the special example of the maxwell - chern - simons lagrangian  ( [ l_cs ] ) , this functional reads : @xmath59 but although the chern - simons term preserves the hamiltonian functional , it does modify the dynamical properties of the system through a modification of the basic commutation rules between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "more precisely , we have : @xmath60=-i\\hbar(2\\nu)\\delta ( \\mathbf{r } -\\mathbf{r^{\\prime } } ) \\ ] ] so it appears that finding the appropriate deformations of electric field operators plays a crucial role in constructing the hamiltonian version of a chern - simons theory .",
    "we have also seen that such deformations are strongly constrained by the requirement of invariance under local gauge transformations .",
    "this discussion shows that most of the relevant information is implicitely encoded in the additional phase - factor @xmath48 involved in quantum gauge transformations , as in eqs .",
    "( [ gaugetransformedwavefunctional ] ) and ( [ gaugetransformedbasisstate ] ) .",
    "let us now briefly discuss what happens when the model is defined on a two - dimensional space manifold @xmath18 with a boundary @xmath61 . using stokes formula , we may recast the phase factor @xmath48 attached to a gauge - transformation as : @xmath62 in this situation , the phase factor @xmath48 is no longer gauge - invariant , and this implies that two gauge transformations attached to functions @xmath22 and @xmath63 do not commute because :    @xmath64    in more mathematical terms , this reflects the fact that the phase - factor @xmath48 , as used in eqs .",

    "the notion of a lie algebra is no longer available , so it is natural to define the model on a lattice . in a classical gauge theory , each oriented link @xmath73 carries a group element @xmath74 .",

    "the presence of a chern - simons term is manifested by an additional phase - factor whose precise value depends on the lattice geometry and is to some extent arbitrary , since fluxes are defined on plaquettes , not on lattice sites . on a square lattice , a natural choice is to define @xmath87 according to  @xcite : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the oriented loop defined by the outer boundary of the four elementary plaquettes adjacent to site @xmath83 .",

    "as we have seen , each of these processes may be described by a gauge - invariant operator .",
    "let us denote by @xmath356 the product of all these operators involved in the creation of the string .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath357 .",
    "more generally , we may start from a state already characterized by a pair of fluxes @xmath358 .",
    "since @xmath347 and @xmath348 commute up to homotopy , we require that @xmath350 and @xmath351 commute in @xmath3 .",
    "the string picture allows us to construct operators @xmath359 and @xmath360 such that : @xmath361 denoting by @xmath362 any state with the pair of fluxes @xmath358 , we show below that @xmath359 and @xmath360 do not commute , but their actions on a state @xmath362 are related by phase - factors : @xmath363 note that in order for all four states , , , to be defined , the following constraints have to be imposed : @xmath364 this relation  ( [ eqphasestrings ] ) is reminiscent of the phase factors involved in permuting electrical field operators attached to adjacent links for abelian models with a chern - simons term  @xcite .",
    "let us now briefly explain how to derive the relations  ( [ defininglambda ] ) and ( [ eqphasestrings ] ) expressing the commutation rules between @xmath359 and @xmath360 .",
    "the first step is to choose template states for a pair of fluxes @xmath358 along elementary cycles @xmath347 and @xmath348 .",
    "these are depicted on fig .",

    "note that we do not need explicitely the values of the fluxon hopping amplitudes @xmath160 , but simply the fact they are local and that fluxon moving operators commute with gauge transformation .",
    "the value of @xmath365 obtained in this way ( see eq .  ( [ eqphasestrings ] ) ) is valid not only for our template state @xmath362 but for any state deduced from it by a gauge transformation ."
