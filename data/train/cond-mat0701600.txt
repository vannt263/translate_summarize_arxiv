    "many of the high-@xmath1 cuprate materials show signatures of static or dynamic spin and charge modulation , or _ stripes",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the effect of stripes on high - temperature superconductivity is a subject of ongoing debate : some researchers consider them central to the mechanism of superconductivity , others consider them detrimental , and yet others argue that stripes are irrelevant .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the difficulty of detecting the presence of stripes , particularly when they are only weakly pinned to the lattice , or dynamical .",
    "the former case is typically associated with zero - frequency incommensurate - momentum response in neutron scattering  @xcite , while the latter is associated with finite - frequency incommensurate - momentum response  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of direct detection has motivated other approaches to stripe detection based on their effects , e.g. , on the phonon modes  @xcite , or lattice structure  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one naturally expects that in the presence of sharp stripes there will be a rearrangement of the collective mode spectrum , with the formation of local modes split off from the bulk continuum , or _ edge modes _  @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking effects in the striped cuprates is the suppression of the superconductivity near the @xmath0 hole - doping , where ( based on neutron scattering ) the stripes become stationary : the so - called  @xmath0-anomaly \"  @xcite . at @xmath0 doping ,",
    "stripes are locked in with the lattice resulting in a commensurate modulation wavenumber .",
    "this suppresses the charge and spin fluctuations , which are considered to be important for superconductivity .",
    "away from @xmath0 doping , on the other hand , the favorable wavenumber for the stripe structure is expected to be incommensurate and proportional to the hole concentration .",
    "naturally , the incommensurability renders the stripes more dynamical . while this anomaly strongly suggests that the commensurate ( c ) stripes suppress superconductivity , the question of whether incommensurate ( ic ) ( or fluctuating ) stripes promote the superconductivity remains .",
    "we believe that study of this interplay is important for developing an understanding of the high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates . as a first step , in this paper",
    ", we discuss the c - ic transition near the commensurate doping , calculating the transition point within a weak pinning approximation .",
    "we also calculate the energy of two charge - spin - lattice excitations , namely , the _ phason _ and the _ amplitudon_. in the last part of the paper , we provide relations between ginzburg - landau parameters ( order parameters , energy coefficients ) and physical quantities ( conductivity , dielectric function ) by considering the response to an electric field .",
    "we model the stripe phase by a simultaneous unidirectional sinusoidal charge density wave ( cdw ) and spin density wave ( sdw ) with wavelengths @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath4 is the lattice constant , @xmath5 is the reciprocal - lattice vector , and @xmath6 is the ordering vector .",
    "we introduce @xmath7 and @xmath8 as the complex order parameters for the cdw and the sdw , respectively .",
    "the real part of @xmath9 gives the deviation of the charge density from the uniform state : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the average hole - density per site : @xmath12 for a doping @xmath13 .",
