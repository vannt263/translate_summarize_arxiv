    "in [ [ fivebranes and knots ] ] , witten proposed a new physical interpretation of the jones polynomial and khovanov homology in terms of counting the solutions of a certain supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions and five dimensions .",

    "the case of the empty knot is resolved in [ [ the nahm pole boundary condition ] ] .",

    "one is the traditional uhlenbeck bubbling phenomenon [ [ uhlenbeckcompactness]][[removeofsingularities ] ] , and another is the non - compactness coming from the unboundness of the @xmath9 norm of @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , a natural question to ask is whether the uhlenbeck bubbling phenomenon can appear for solutions to the kapustin - witten equations .",
    "in addition , do we have a model solution to the kapustin - witten equations .    in this paper , we construct some singular solutions to the kapustin - witten equations . to be more precise , we prove the following :    after identifying euclidean space @xmath11 with the quaternions @xmath12 , for any real number c , the formulas @xmath13 give solutions to the kapustin - witten equations @xmath14 with the following properties :    @xmath15 for @xmath16 , the solutions are smooth away from @xmath17 and decay to 0 when @xmath18 .",

    "denote by @xmath331 a closed 3-manifold , give a point @xmath332 , for integer @xmath333 , let @xmath334 be any orthonormal basis of @xmath335 and let @xmath336 be elements in the adjoint bundle @xmath337 with the relation that @xmath338=\\epsilon_{abc}t_c$ ] . for @xmath339 , we denote by @xmath340 the coordinate for @xmath341 .    from [ [ the nahm pole boundary condition ] ] [ [ fivebranes and knots ] ] , we have the following definition of the nahm pole boundary condition on @xmath339 .",
    "a solution @xmath342 to the kapustin - witten equations @xmath14 over @xmath339 satisfies the nahm pole boundary if there exist @xmath334 , @xmath336 as above such that the taylor expansion in @xmath340 coordinate nears @xmath343 will be @xmath344 .      in this subsection",
    ", we will describe the nahm pole boundary condition on @xmath345 and show that our solutions in section 3 satisfy the nahm pole boundary condition .",
    "now , we first describe the tangent space of @xmath345 .",
    "consider @xmath345 as the unit quaternion , @xmath346 , and with the metric induced by euclidean metric on @xmath11 .",
