    "rydberg - rydberg interactions are very interesting for use in mesoscopic quantum manipulations .",
    "the extremely strong interactions between two rydberg atoms have been proposed to entangle large numbers of atoms in a non - trivial manner using the phenomenon of blockade @xcite . when a mesoscopic sample is illuminated with narrowband lasers tuned to a rydberg state",
    ", only one atom at a time can be excited if the rydberg - rydberg interaction exceeds the linewidth of the laser - atom coupling .",
    "therefore the mesoscopic cloud of atoms behaves as an effective 2-level system , with the upper level being a single collective excitation .    in order to attain the strongest possible rydberg blockade , it is desirable to operate under conditions where the rydberg - rydberg interaction is not the usual @xmath2 or @xmath3 van - der - waals interactions , but instead is resonantly enhanced by `` fster  @xmath4 '' processes @xcite such as @xmath5 that lead to isotropic @xmath0 long - range behavior when the @xmath6 states are degenerate with the @xmath7 states .",
    "dramatic enhancements of collisional interactions due to such resonant couplings have been demonstrated for rydberg excitation in a magneto - optical trap@xcite .",
    "the quantum nature of these types of interactions was recently used to resolve molecules 12 nm apart in an organic solid @xcite . due to the high density of rydberg states , there are typically many candidate levels for such fster  processes .",
    "an important consideration for quantum information applications of rydberg blockade is the size of cloud required .",
    "the spatial extent of the cloud must be small enough for excitation of a single atom anywhere in the cloud to block the excitation of every other atom in the cloud . even with the great strength of rydberg - rydberg interactions , the required size of the clouds is likely to be less than 10 microns for fast ( 1 mhz ) operations .",
    "only recently have atom clouds of such small size been produced in the laboratory@xcite . even in the case that sub - micron mesoscopic samples are realized experimentally , there are other applications of such samples that benefit from the sample being as large as possible .",
    "for example , we have recently proposed single - photon sources , single - photon detectors , and quantum state transmission @xcite using mesoscopic rydberg blockade . in these applications",
    "one would like the cloud to be many wavelengths in size in order that the diffraction limited light fields not occupy too large a solid angle .",
    "for this to be effective requires the blockade to operate over clouds of several microns in extent .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine some issues that arise in the application of fster  processes to rydberg blockade .",
    "in particular , when the quantum numbers for the states are of the form @xmath8 we show that one or more of the @xmath9 states have @xmath10 .",
    "these `` fster  zero '' states then only exhibit the usual van - der - waals long - range behavior and will therefore set limits on the attainable cloud sizes for quantum manipulations using rydberg blockade . only when @xmath11 are there no fster  zero states .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have observed strong suppression of excitation in very large clouds that is strong evidence for blockade but do not address whether or not the blockade is complete as required for quantum information applications .    in the following ,",
    "we first ( section [ sec : background ] ) present a more detailed background discussion of the importance of strong isotropic rydberg - rydberg interactions for quantum manipulations using rydberg blockade .",
    "we then illustrate in section [ sec : foster ] how the fster  process accomplishes this .",
    "section [ sec : zeros ] presents the main result of this paper : for many possible fster  processes there exists a linear combination of atomic sublevels that have @xmath10 .",
    "this result is extended to the important case of fine - structure interactions in section [ sec : finestructure ] .",
    "we conclude with more implications of this work .",
    "the basic physics behind the dipole - blockade concept is illustrated in figure  [ entangle ] .",
    "suppose we have @xmath12 atoms in an atomic ground state @xmath13 .",
    "we envision exciting the atoms to a rydberg state @xmath14 of energy @xmath15 using a narrowband laser . as shown in the figure , excitation of one of the two atoms to the rydberg state",
    "is allowed while excitation of the second atom is off - resonant and therefore suppressed .",
    "addition of more atoms changes the effectiveness of this `` blockade '' but does not change the basic physics of the situation .",
    "excitation of more than one atom is energetically suppressed as long as the interaction between each pair of atoms in the ensemble exceeds the bandwidth of the laser - atom excitation . neglecting spontaneous emission or other decohering effects",
    ", when subject to dipole blockade and a continuous light field the atoms will undergo coherent rabi oscillations between states @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    .",
    "]    to see how this process can be used to generate interesting entanglement , we simply imagine driving the atom pair in the @xmath18 state with a @xmath19 pulse .",
    "the atoms will then be in a coherent superposition of states @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath20 that can not be written as a product of two individual wavefunctions and is therefore entangled . to avoid the inevitable decoherence of the unstable rydberg state , the entanglement can be usefully transferred to a second ground state @xmath21 with a @xmath19-pulse from a second laser tuned to the @xmath22 transition .",
    "again , this concept can be extended to a collection of @xmath23 atoms without loss of generality .",
    "the final wavefunction is a symmetric entangled superposition of @xmath24 atoms in state @xmath13 and one atom in state @xmath21 .",
    "there are several intriguing characteristics of this process .",
    "first , the entanglement is generated between the internal states of the atom ; any motion of the atom is unimportant .",
    "this means that it is not necessary for the atoms to be localized in the ground state of a confining potential , so the method does not require coherence of the external degrees of freedom of the atoms .",
    "there is also no motional constraint on the speed at which the process can occur .",
    "second , the value of the rydberg - rydberg interaction @xmath25 is not important to first order , as long as it is much larger than the bandwidth of the light - atom interaction .",
    "this implies that the atoms can be at random distances @xmath26 from each other , as long as they are not too far apart . finally , since the blockade mechanism suppresses excitation of multiple rydberg atoms , the atoms never actually experience the strong rydberg - rydberg forces , avoiding heating .",
    "key to the entanglement process is the requirement that the rydberg - rydberg frequency shift be large compared to the bandwidth of the light - atom interaction .",
    "if this is violated , the fidelity of the entanglement operations will be compromised . in a mesoscopic sample ,",
    "insufficient blockade in any possible excitation channel is sufficient to cause copious production of excited atoms .",
    "we now examine the rydberg - rydberg interactions to see under what conditions this will be problematic .",
    "we wish to consider the interactions between two like rydberg atoms that lead to blockade .",
    "normally , in the absence of an external electric field these interactions are of the van - der - waals forms @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "since an electric field mixes states of opposite parity together , a rydberg atom can have a permanent dipole moment , leading to a much stronger and longer range @xmath29 interaction .",
    "the interaction between two such atoms a and b is the familiar @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the angle between the interatomic separation @xmath32 and the electric field @xmath33 .",
    "the fact that @xmath34 makes this interaction huge for two rydberg states .",
    "however , it has the undesirable feature for dipole - blockade that it vanishes at @xmath35 , allowing for excitation of rydberg atom pairs located at this angle with respect to each other .",
    "it is possible to have an isotropic rydberg atom - atom interaction of comparable strength to this if there is a degeneracy in the energy - level spectrum for a pair of atoms .",
    "for example , inspection of figure  [ rbelevels ] shows that the 50s state of rb is nearly symmetrically placed between the 49p and 50p states .",
    "this means that the 50s+50s state of a rydberg atom pair is nearly degenerate with the 49p+50p state . neglecting the influence of other nearby states , the eigenstates of the two - atom system",
    "are linear combinations of 50s+50s and 49p+50p , with energy shifts proportional to @xmath29 . using the methods described below , we find that the rydberg - rydberg potential energy curves are given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 mhz @xmath38m@xmath39 and the ss - pp energy defect is @xmath40 mhz .",
    "estimates similar to this have been previously presented by protsenko _",
    "et al._@xcite .     partially compensates for the non - zero energy defect . ]    a plot of @xmath41 is shown in figure  [ pot50s ] . if there were perfect fster  degeneracy ( @xmath42 ) the dipole - dipole interaction would exceed 10 mhz out to distances of 10 microns",
    "this would be very promising for realizing dipole blockade in quite large clouds .",
    "however , the energy defect for real rb atoms reduces the interaction substantially , becoming the usual van - der - waals form @xmath43 at large distances . here",
    "we should note that we are restricting ourselves to mixing of states that are nearly resonant .",
    "other states , such as 51p+48p in this example , have larger energy defects ( @xmath44 ghz for 51p+48p ) and often much smaller matrix elements as well . adding up many such states could ( and should ) be done in second order perturbation theory and",
    "will alter the @xmath28 part of the potential somewhat but not change the overall conclusions . for the rest of this paper we will continue to neglect these other states .",
    "we will also neglect the @xmath27 quadrupole - quadrupole interactions .",
    "the strength of the rydberg - rydberg interactions varies strongly with principal quantum number .",
    "the radial matrix elements scale as @xmath45 , so @xmath46 scales as @xmath47 .",
    "since the energy defect @xmath48 scales as @xmath49 , the van - der - waals interactions scale as @xmath50 .",
    "thus the range of the rydberg blockade increases as roughly @xmath51 , so that @xmath52 has nearly twice the range as @xmath53 , as illustrated in figure  [ pot50s ] .",
    "increasing @xmath54 comes with increased sensitivity to stray electric fields , black - body radiation , and so forth . in practice , states up to @xmath55 should be stable enough to perform fast quantum operations@xcite .",
    "however , it would be preferable to find states with smaller energy defects and therefore larger range at smaller @xmath54 .    given the lack of perfect fster  resonances for the s - state , one should consider the possibility of fster  processes in other angular momentum states where the energy defects may be smaller than they are for the @xmath56 states .",
    "interesting new properties of the fster  process arise when we consider higher angular momentum states . for example , consider again the s and p states of rb , but this time with laser excitation of the p - states , so that the relevant fster  degeneracy is , say , 50p+50p@xmath5750s+51s with an energy defect @xmath58930 mhz .",
    "suppose also that the atoms are subject to linearly polarized light polarized along the laboratory @xmath59-axis .",
    "we shall show that there is no fster  blockade for this situation . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that two atoms are aligned with @xmath60 . in this case",
    ", consider the wavefunction @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) whose matrix element of @xmath63 is zero with the @xmath64 states : @xmath65 and so the only long - range interaction will be a van - der - waals interaction with the comparatively far off - resonant @xmath66 and @xmath67 states",
    ". note that @xmath68 is strongly coupled to the light through its @xmath69 part . with strong light coupling and weak dipole - dipole coupling ,",
    "we conclude that the rb p - states will not experience long - range dipole blockade .",
    "these conclusions are not changed when @xmath70 is rotated away from @xmath59 .",
    "if one takes the quantization axis along @xmath70 then @xmath68 stays of the same form , but each of the three parts of @xmath68 will contribute to the light - atom interaction .",
    "for the rest of the paper we shall take the quantization axis for the atomic basis states to be along @xmath70 .",
    "another very interesting possibility from figure  [ rbelevels ] is the nearly degenerate combination 48d+48d@xmath5750p+46f with an energy defect of only @xmath71 mhz ( neglecting fine structure for now ) .",
    "this has the potential for much stronger fster  interactions at large distance as compared to the @xmath64 states . in this case",
    "there is also a wavefunction with zero coupling via @xmath63 to the p+f manifold : @xmath72 where interchange - symmetric kets are defined in terms of the quantum numbers @xmath73 of the individual atoms as @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "we shall label such states as fster  zero states .    whereas the fster  zero state of equation  [ zeroppss ]",
    "can be deduced in a straightforward way essentially by inspection once the matrix elements of s+s with the three p+p combinations are calculated , the d+d fster  zero state of equation  [ zeroddpf ] is more subtle since its matrix elements with each of the three @xmath76 states must vanish .",
    "thus we now discuss in more generality the conditions for fster  zero states to exist for the process @xmath77 we will assume without loss of generality that @xmath78 .",
    "the fster  zero state , if it exists , is written as a linear combination @xmath79 , so the condition @xmath80 gives @xmath81 which is effectively a generalization of equation  [ zeroppss2 ] to the case where there are multiple possible final states .",
    "there are three cases of interest . for @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( of",
    "which d+d@xmath57p+f is an example ) there are @xmath84 equations in the @xmath85 unknowns @xmath86 .",
    "but the reflection symmetry @xmath87 means that @xmath88 of the equations are the same , leaving @xmath89 equations in @xmath85 unknowns and therefore a solution exists . for the case",
    "@xmath90 the same argument holds .",
    "the final case , with @xmath91 , has equation  [ eqzeros ] with @xmath92 equations in @xmath85 unknowns and therefore no fster  zero state .",
    "these results can also be understood from the point of view of the molecular symmetries of the problem . following the analysis of marinescu@xcite , the fster  zero states have the molecular symmetries",
    "@xmath93 and @xmath94 depending on their triplet or singlet spin character . for @xmath95 , the orbital exchange - symmetric kets as defined above are not eigenstates of the operator @xmath96 that reflects the wavefunction about a plane containing the interatomic axis .",
    "taking into account this symmetry , we define kets @xmath97 which have molecular parity ( @xmath98 ) if @xmath99 ) and reflection symmetry eigenvalues @xmath100 , giving rise to states of traditional molecular designation @xmath101 . considering triplet states , and assuming @xmath102 , there are @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 states , @xmath103 @xmath106 @xmath107 states , @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 states , and @xmath108 @xmath111 @xmath112 states .",
    "thus for the @xmath113 problem , there are three @xmath93 states with @xmath66 character but only two of @xmath114 character .",
    "therefore it is always possible to find a linear combination of the three @xmath93 @xmath66 states that has zero coupling to the two @xmath114 @xmath93 states .",
    "the reasoning is identical for the @xmath94 symmetry .    to summarize ,",
    "the isotropic @xmath0 dipole - dipole interaction generated by the fster  process @xmath115 will have states with @xmath10 unless @xmath91 .",
    "the above analysis has emphasized the @xmath93 and @xmath94 states that are degenerate in the absence of overlap .",
    "similar reasoning shows that for the case @xmath116 the @xmath117 and @xmath118 states have no fster  zeros , nor do states of @xmath119 . in general ,",
    "all of these states are coupled to the light field , but the @xmath93 and @xmath94 states destroy the complete blockade .",
    "in general , the fine stucture interaction can not be neglected . at @xmath53",
    "the rb p - state fine structure splitting is about 800 mhz and the d splitting is 100 mhz , so that at micron - scale distances there will be strong fine - structure mixing by the dipole - dipole interaction . at long enough range , where the dipole - dipole interaction is smaller than the fine - structure splitting",
    ", we can use the same type of arguments as above to analyze the problem .",
    "let us consider the fster  process @xmath120 we are mostly interested in states with total @xmath121 .",
    "as before , the @xmath122 states are symmetric linear combinations @xmath123 . for alkali atoms with half - integer @xmath124",
    "there are @xmath125 such states . on the other hand ,",
    "there are ( assuming @xmath126 ) @xmath127 @xmath128 states .",
    "half of these are removed from consideration due to the @xmath129 symmetry .",
    "thus the system of equations for the fster  zero amplitudes @xmath130 has @xmath125 equations in @xmath131 unknowns .",
    "a normalizable solution will exist only for @xmath132 .",
    "it follows that potential fster  processes such as @xmath133 will have zeros .",
    "the inclusion of fine structure brings new possibilities , however , since states of different @xmath134 can have the same value of @xmath124 .",
    "for example , @xmath135 has an energy defect of only -15 mhz at @xmath136 and should not have any fster  zeros .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix has the structure @xmath137 where the interaction submatrix @xmath138 and @xmath139 mhz @xmath38m@xmath39 . for @xmath42 , the eigenvalues of @xmath140 corresponding to the @xmath66 states are @xmath141 .",
    "two of the eigenvalues are quite small ( @xmath142 ) , leading to poor rydberg blockade .",
    "the potential curves for @xmath143 mhz are shown in figure  [ fig : finestructure ] . the nearly flat potential shows that while there are no fster  zeros for this case , the rydberg blockade is still strongly suppressed at large distances even though the energy defect is very small . even in the presence of fine structure ,",
    "the blockade is still poor if @xmath144 .",
    "potential curves near the @xmath145 asymptote of rb@xmath146 .",
    "the nearly flat curve coming from the @xmath145 asymptote implies suppressed dipole blockade . ]",
    "the primary result of this paper is that the very long - range @xmath0 interactions produced by resonances @xmath147 have states with @xmath10 unless @xmath148 .",
    "this strongly reduces the number of possibilities for attaining high fidelity dipole - blockade in mesoscopic atom samples .",
    "one solution is to rely instead on quadrupole - quadrupole ( @xmath27 ) or second - order dipole - dipole ( 1/@xmath149 ) interactions to acheive blockade at high values of @xmath54 . as pointed out recently by the connecticut group @xcite the interactions under these conditions",
    "can be quite strong .",
    "another possibility for attaining strong dipole blockade is to tune @xmath148 resonances with an electric field .",
    "for example , the great sensitivity of @xmath150 states to electric fields can tune @xmath151 into resonance at modest fields . at resonance ,",
    "the long range potentials for this case are @xmath152 and thus should lead to quite strong rydberg blockade at long range .",
