    "this paper gives a full description of the semiclassical spectral theory of _ quantum toric integrable systems _ in any finite dimension .",
    "the classical limit corresponding to quantum toric integrable systems are the so called symplectic toric manifolds or _",
    "toric systems_. such a system consists of a compact symplectic @xmath0-manifold equipped with @xmath1 commuting hamiltonians @xmath2 with periodic flows .",
    "the paper combines geometric techniques from the theory of toric manifolds , in the complex - algebraic and symplectic settings , with recently developed microlocal analytic methods for toeplitz operators .    as a consequence of the spectral theory we develop , we answer the _ isospectrality _ question for quantum toric integrable systems , in any finite dimension : the semiclassical joint spectrum of a quantum toric integrable system , given by a sequence of commuting toeplitz operators acting on quantum hilbert spaces , determines the classical system given by the symplectic manifold and poisson commuting functions , up to symplectic isomorphisms .",
    "this type of symplectic isospectral problem belongs to the realm of classical questions in inverse spectral theory and microlocal analysis , going back to pioneer works of colin de verdire @xcite and guillemin - sternberg @xcite in the 1970s and 1980s",
    ".    the question of isospectrality in riemannian geometry may be traced back to weyl @xcite and is most well known thanks to kac s article @xcite , who himself attributes the question to bochner .",
    "kac popularized the sentence : _  can one hear the shape of a drum ? \" _ , to refer to this type of isospectral problem .",
    "the spectral theory developed in this paper exemplifies a striking difference with riemannian geometry , where this type of isospectrality rarely holds true , and suggests that _ symplectic _ invariants are much better encoded in spectral theory than _ riemannian _ invariants .",
    "an approach to this problem for general integrable systems is suggested in the last two authors article @xcite .",
    "we refer to section [ sec : remarks ] for further remarks , and references , in these directions .      the notion of a quantum integrable system , as a maximal set of commuting quantum observables , dates back to the early quantum mechanics , to the works of bohr , sommerfeld and einstein  @xcite .",
    "however , the most basic results in the symplectic theory of classical integrable systems like darboux s theorem or action - angle variables could not be used in schrdinger s quantum setting at that time because they make use of the analysis of differential ( or pseudodifferential ) operators in phase space , known now as microlocal analysis , which was developed only in the 1960s .",
    "the microlocal analysis of action - angle variables starts with the works of duistermaat  @xcite and colin de verdire @xcite , followed by the semiclassical theory by charbonnel @xcite , and more recently by v ngc @xcite , zelditch and toth @xcite , charbonnel and popov @xcite , melin - sjstrand @xcite , and many others .",
    "effective models in quantum mechanics often require a compact phase space , and thus can not be treated using pseudodifferential calculus .",
    "for instance the natural classical limit of a quantum spin is a symplectic sphere .",
    "the study of quantum action - angle variables in the case of compact symplectic manifolds treated in this paper was started by charles @xcite , using the theory of toeplitz operators . in the present paper , we present global spectral results for toric integrable systems ; we use in a fundamental way delzant s theorem on symplectic toric manifolds @xcite .",
    "toric integrable systems have played an influential role in symplectic and complex algebraic geometry , representation theory , and spectral theory since t. delzant classified them in terms of combinatorial information ( actually , in terms of a convex polytope , see theorem [ theo : delzant ] ) .",
    "a comparative study of symplectic toric manifolds from the symplectic and complex algebraic view points was given by duistermaat and pelayo  @xcite .",
    "a beautiful treatment of the classical theory of toric systems is given in guillemin s book @xcite .",
    "toeplitz operators are a natural generalization of toeplitz matrices ( which correspond to toeplitz operators on the unit disk ) . on @xmath3 ,",
    "toeplitz operators correspond to pseudodifferential operators via the bargmann transform .",
    "of course , such a correspondence can not hold in the case of a compact phase space , but it turns out that toeplitz operators always give rise to a semiclassical algebra of operators with a symbolic calculus and microlocalization properties , which is microlocally isomorphic to the algebra of pseudodifferential operators .",
    "see the book by boutet de monvel and guillemin for an introduction to the spectral theory of toeplitz operators @xcite .",
    "1em      in order to state our results , let us introduce the required terminology .",
    "if @xmath4 is a symplectic manifold , a smooth map @xmath5 is called a _ momentum map _ for a hamiltonian @xmath1-torus action if the hamiltonian flows @xmath6 are periodic of period 1 , and pairwise commute  : @xmath7 , so that they define an action of @xmath8 .",
    "if this action is effective and @xmath9 is compact .",
    "@xmath0-dimensional and connected , we call @xmath10 a _ symplectic toric manifold_.    by the atiyah and guillemin - sternberg theorem , for any torus hamiltonian action on a connected compact manifold , the image of the momentum map is a rational convex polytope  @xcite . for a symplectic toric manifold , the momentum polytope @xmath11 has the additional property that for each vertex @xmath12 of @xmath13 , the primitive normal vectors to the facets meeting at @xmath12 form a basis of the integral lattice @xmath14 .",
    "we call such a polytope a _ delzant polytope_.    a now standard procedure introduced by b. kostant @xcite and j.m . souriau @xcite to quantize a symplectic compact manifold @xmath15 is to introduce a prequantum bundle @xmath16 , that is a hermitian line bundle with curvature @xmath17 and a complex structure @xmath18 compatible with @xmath19 .",
    "one then defines the quantum space as the space @xmath20 of holomorphic sections of @xmath21 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is a positive integer , the semi - classical limit corresponds to the large @xmath22 limit . a description of this procedure , which is called _ geometric quantization _ ,",
    "is given by kostant and pelayo in @xcite from the angle of lie theory and representation theory .",
    "not all symplectic manifold have a complex structure or a prequantum bundle .",
    "however a symplectic toric manifold always admits a compatible complex structure , which is not unique .",
    "furthermore a symplectic toric manifold @xmath9 with momentum map @xmath23 is prequantizable if and only if there exists @xmath24 such that the vertices of the polytope @xmath25 belong to @xmath26 ( see section [ sec : prequantization ] ) .",
    "if it is the case , the prequantum bundle is unique up to isomorphism .    in many papers ,",
    "a prequantum bundle is defined as a line bundle with curvature @xmath27 . with this normalization ,",
    "the cohomology class of @xmath19 is integral and the prequantization condition for toric manifolds is that , up to translation , the momentum polytope has integral vertices .",
    "this normalization may look simpler than ours , which includes a @xmath28-factor .",
    "nevertheless , our choice is justified by the weyl law .",

    "the semiclassical parameter is @xmath33 .",
    "a toeplitz operator has a _ principal symbol _ , which is a smooth function on the phase space @xmath9 . if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are toeplitz operators , then @xmath36 is a toeplitz operator with the same principal symbol as @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath37 is hermitian ( i.e. self - adjoint ) for @xmath22 sufficiently large , then the principal symbol of @xmath34 is real - valued .",
    "two toeplitz operators @xmath38 and @xmath39 _ commute _ it @xmath37 and @xmath40 commute for every @xmath22 .",
    "we shall also need the following definitions .",

    "thus the joint spectrum of a quantum toric system can obtained by taking the @xmath71 lattice points in a polytope @xmath13 ( as in figure  [ fig : regular ] ) , and applying a small smooth deformation @xmath72 ( as in figure  [ fig : deformed ] ) .",
    "we present next the isospectral theorem for toric systems .",

    "there are many works in this direction , see for instance milnor @xcite , sunada @xcite , berard @xcite , and buser @xcite and gordon - webb - wolpert @xcite .",
    "as we have mentioned , in symplectic geometry a few positive results are known .",
    "these results , and the present paper , give evidence that symplectic invariants seem to be more encodable in the spectrum of a quantum integrable system than riemannian invariants in the spectrum of the lapace operator .",
    "inverse type results in the realm of spectral geometry have been obtained by many other authors , see for instance brning - heintze @xcite , colin de verdire @xcite , colin de verdire - guillemin @xcite , croke - sharafutdinov @xcite , guillemin - kazhdan @xcite , mckean - singer @xcite , osgood - phillips - sarnak @xcite , and zelditch @xcite , and the references therein . an interesting general problem ( for instance in the context of toric geometry )",
    "is to what extent information about measures may be recovered from the spectrum , see guillemin - sternberg @xcite for a result in this direction .",
    "in @xcite the last two authors formulated an inverse spectral conjecture for semitoric completely integrable systems ( see @xcite for a classification of semitoric systems in terms of five symplectic invariants ) : the semiclassical joint spectrum of a quantum semitoric system determines the corresponding classical system .",
    "_ semitoric systems _ are four - dimensional integrable systems with two degrees of freedom for which one component of the system generates a @xmath28-periodic flow .",
    "semitoric systems lie somewhere in between toric systems and general integrable systems .",
    "if both components of the semitoric system are @xmath28-periodic , i.e. the system is generated by a hamiltonian @xmath668-torus action , then the system is a _ toric system _ ( strictly speaking after a harmless rescaling of the periods ) .",
    "theorem  [ theo : inverse - spectral ] above solves the conjecture in the class of toric systems . in this class",
