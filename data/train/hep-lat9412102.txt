    "the parameter @xmath0 plays a role analogous to the volume in ordinary systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom per site , and the double scaling limit describing the simultaneous approach @xmath13 and @xmath14 is shown to be equivalent to finite size scaling of 2-d spin systems close to the criticality  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the above large-@xmath0 critical phenomenon by monte carlo simulations , that is by extrapolating , possibly in a controlled manner , numerical results at sufficiently large @xmath0 , in the same spirit of the double scaling limit technique developed in the studies of 1-d matrix models .",

    "we recall that the 2-d xy model critical behavior is characterized by a sharp approach to the critical point @xmath41 ( the correlation length grows exponentially ) , a line of fixed point for @xmath42 , and a finite specific heat having a peak for a @xmath43 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "in our simulations we used local algorithms containing overrelaxation precedures . in the @xmath2 case , we employed the cabibbo - marinari algorithm  @xcite to upgrade @xmath2 matrices by updating their @xmath44 subgroups , chosen randomly among the @xmath45 subgroups acting on each @xmath46 submatrix .",

    "the above algorithm experiences a critical slowing down in @xmath0 , that is keeping the correlation length fixed the autocorrelation time grows with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this effect is partially compensated by a reduction of the fluctuations of group invariant quantities when @xmath0 grows . in the @xmath1 simulations",
    "the quantities related to the determinant channel are subjected to large fluctuations , causing large errors in the measurements .    in tables",
    "[ untable ] and [ suntable ] we present monte carlo data respectively for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 simulations",

    "such a behavior of the specific heat should be an indication of a phase transition for @xmath6 at a finite @xmath3 .",

    "a more accurate estimate of the critical coupling @xmath3 can be obtained by using a finite @xmath0 scaling ansatz @xmath64 in order to extrapolate @xmath65 to @xmath13 .",
    "the above ansatz is suggested by the idea that the parameter @xmath0 may play a role quite analogous to the volume in the ordinary systems close to the criticality .",

    "the reweighting technique  @xcite , turns out to be very efficient to determine quantities like the position of the specific heat peak . in our work",
    "we could use this technique only for @xmath54 , since for larger @xmath0 the reweighting range around the point where the simulation is performed turned out to be much smaller than the typical @xmath36 interval of our simulations . for @xmath69 @xmath65 data and their errors",

    "we checked the finite @xmath0 scaling ansatz ( [ fns ] ) in the similar context of the large-@xmath0 phase transition of 1-d lattice @xmath1 chiral models with free boundary conditions , where the critical point @xmath3 and the critical exponents @xmath77 and @xmath8 are known : @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we computed the position of the specific heat peak at finite @xmath0 finding the asymptotic behavior ( [ fns ] ) with @xmath81 .",
    "details on these calculations are given in the appendix .",
    "as already mentioned , from standard finite size scaling arguments the critical exponent @xmath68 should be related to the critical exponent @xmath77 : @xmath82 .",
    "notice that the critical exponents @xmath77 and @xmath8 satisfy a two - dimensional hyperscaling relation : @xmath83 . in 1-d lattice chiral models",
    "the number @xmath84 of effective dimensions of the large-@xmath0 critical phenomenon is related to the fact that the double limit @xmath15 and @xmath14 is equivalent to the continuous limit of a two - dimensional gravity model with central charge @xmath85 .",
    "since the large-@xmath0 phase transition of the 2-d lattice chiral models is of the second order type , its behavior can not be found in the classification of double scaling limits of refs .",
    "@xcite , which are parametrized by a central charge @xmath86 implying @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , unlike 1-d lattice chiral models , the interpretation of the large-@xmath0 phase transition of 2-d lattice chiral models as an effective @xmath84 ordinary critical phenomenon does not seem to be valid : in fact , if @xmath82 , by substituting our estimates of @xmath8 and @xmath68 in the hyperscaling relation @xmath88 we would obtain @xmath89 .",
    "a more general thermodynamic inequality would give @xmath90  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo data of @xmath32 and @xmath34 for @xmath91 compare very well with the large-@xmath0 strong coupling series of @xmath32 ( up to @xmath92 order ) and @xmath34 ( up to @xmath93 order )  @xcite .",

    "large-@xmath0 numerical results seem to indicate that all physical quantities , such as @xmath32 and @xmath34 , are well behaved functions of the internal energy @xmath94 even at @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "therefore as a consequence of the specific heat divergence at @xmath3 , the @xmath6 @xmath36-function @xmath95 should have a non - analytical zero at @xmath3 , that is @xmath96 in the neighbourhood of @xmath3 . by",
    "defining a new temperature proportional to the energy  @xcite , this singularity disappears , and one can find good agreement between the measured mass scale and the asymptotic scaling predictions in the `` energy '' scheme even for @xmath12 , where strong coupling expansion is expected to converge  @xcite .",
    "in fact strong coupling computations show asymptotic scaling with a surprising accuracy of few per cent  @xcite .    in the @xmath1 case ,",
    "a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition driven by the determinant is expected at @xmath97 for each finite @xmath0 .",
    "our data seem to support this picture , indeed after the peak of @xmath98 , the magnetic susceptibility @xmath33 and the second moment correlation length @xmath35 defined from the determinant correlation function  ( [ gund ] ) begin to grow very fast . in fig .",
    "[ chid ] we plot @xmath33 versus @xmath36 . green and samuel argued ( using strong coupling and weak coupling arguments ) that the large-@xmath0 phase transition is nothing but the large-@xmath0 limit of the determinant phase transition present in the @xmath1 lattice models  @xcite . according to this conjecture , in the large-@xmath0 limit @xmath38 and @xmath61 should both converge to @xmath3 , and the order of the determinant phase transition would change from an infinite order of the kosterlitz - thouless mechanism to a second order with divergent specific heat .",
    "the large-@xmath0 phase transition of the @xmath2 models could then be explained by the fact that the large-@xmath0 limit of the @xmath2 theory should be the same as the large-@xmath0 limit of the @xmath1 theory .",
    "our numerical results give only a partial confirm of this scenario , we can just hint from the behavior of @xmath33 and @xmath35 with growing @xmath0 that the expected phase transition is moving toward @xmath3 .",
    "the large-@xmath0 strong coupling series of the mass @xmath37 propagating in the determinant channel has been calculated up to @xmath99 order , indicating a critical point , determined by the zero of the @xmath37 series , slightly larger than our determination of @xmath3 : @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained either by the shortness of the strong coupling series of @xmath37 , or by the fact that such a determination of @xmath3 relies on the absence of non - analiticity points before the strong coupling series of @xmath37 vanishes , and therefore a non - analiticity at @xmath101 would invalidate all strong coupling predictions for @xmath102 .      in 1-d principal chiral models the large - n third order phase transition is consequence of a compactification of the eigenvalues of the link operator @xmath103 which are of the form @xmath104 . in the weak coupling region ( @xmath102 ) the phase distribution of the eigenvalues of the link operator @xmath105 , @xmath106 with",

    "the third order critical point @xmath3 is determined by the limit condition @xmath109 , separating the weak coupling from the strong coupling region where @xmath110  @xcite .    in order to see",
    "if a similar phenomenon characterizes the large-@xmath0 phase transition also in 2-d , we have extracted from our simulations the phase distribution @xmath106 of the eigenvalues of @xmath105 .",
