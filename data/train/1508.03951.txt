    ", fluids confined in a pore demonstrate the behavior strongly different from the bulk case .",
    "in slit pores the melting temperature depends strongly on the pore width @xmath0 and the nature of the fluid - wall and fluid - fluid attractive interaction @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 determines not only the magnitude of the shift of the melting temperature but also the structure of confined fluids and appearance of the possible new phases .",
    "the density profile becomes modulated unlike the isotropic one in bulk liquids .",
    "the study of different nanoconfined systems becomes important for both fundamental research and technology because there are a lot of real physical and biological phenomena and processes that depend on the properties of such systems .",
    "nanoconfinement is considerably interesting also due to the new physics observed in these systems . in spite of great importance of this issue",
    ", there is a lack of systematic investigations of effect of confinement on the behavior of aromatic hydrocarbons . only the case of benzene received a lot of attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , liquids with more complex chemical structure are also of interest .    in this paper , we present a systematic molecular dynamics study of cyclohexane in the slit carbon pores . in our previous publications we considered the behavior of benzene in slit pores with graphite and amorphous carbon walls @xcite and inside an armchair nanotube @xcite .",
    "benzene has chemical formula @xmath1 and planar molecule .",
    "the chemical formula of cyclohexane is @xmath2 . adding six more hydrogens changes the bonding inside the carbon ring and",
    "therefore alters the interaction of the ring with external molecules .",
    "moreover , the molecule changes its shape : it is not a planar , but warped . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to compare the behavior of benzene and cyclohexane in the same kinds of pores .",
    "three types of differences can affect the results : the different bonding inside the molecules , the different geometric shape of the molecules and the different number of hydrogens .",
    "the planar structure of the benzene molecule corresponds to the in - plane @xmath3 hybrid orbitals of @xmath4 , which produce a resonant bond shared by all @xmath4 atoms .",
    "the cyclohexane molecule has six @xmath5 carbon atoms .",
    "the strong @xmath6-electron interaction of benzene with nanopore surfaces was found @xcite which plays an essential role in the formation of the local structure of nanoconfined benzene @xcite . at the same time the stronger cyclohexane absorption on graphite than benzene absorption was observed @xcite , and one can suppose that the interaction of @xmath5 carbon atoms of cyclohexane with the graphite confining walls can lead to different structure and thermodynamic behavior of cyclohexane in comparison with benzene .",
    "the behavior of cyclohexane in nanopores is interesting in its own rights .",
    "in particular , in ref . @xcite it was proposed to use cyclohexane for calibration of nmr experiments which can be important for development of experimental techniques .",

    "@xcite the crystallization of cyclohexane confined between parallel mica surfaces was studied .",
    "it was found that with decreasing the pore width up to about @xmath7 ( 6 or 7 layers of cyclohexane ) the crystallization occurs which is observed from the sudden increase of a yield stress .",
    "it is interesting that it was found the remarkable increase of the melting temperature in comparison with the bulk case . in experiments @xcite the solidification",
    "was observed at pressures close to the atmospheric ones , which gives the possibility to suppose that the geometric confinement alone can lead to the solidlike behavior .",

    "@xcite was obtained from computer simulations of model systems @xcite .",
    "an analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that the sign of the change of the melting temperature under confinement depends on the ratio of the fluid - wall to the fluid - fluid attractive interaction .",
    "a number of studies of different systems confined within activated carbon fibers show that the freezing temperature can increase or decrease depending on the nature of the system . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found an increase about @xmath8 in the freezing temperature of benzene in activated carbons . on the other hand , for water , a considerable decrease of the freezing temperature",
    "was observed @xcite .",

    "first of all , in the case of benzene one characterize the orientation of the molecule by the normal vector to the benzene ring plane .",

    "each pair of such vectors can be used to define a plane . the normal vector to this plane can be calculated as the vector product of the corresponding vectors between the atoms . employing this procedure we can calculate @xmath46 vectors perpendicular to the planes of triplets of the carbon atoms and calculate @xmath33 , where @xmath40 is the angle between the @xmath15 axis and the normal vector of each plane .",

    "these peaks slightly decay , but even at @xmath49 they are still as high as @xmath50 .    unlike the outer peaks the inner one rapidly smashes out",
    "one can see that already at @xmath51 it practically disappears . later on",
    "it splits into two peaks , but both of them are small and noisy which means that the orientational order is almost lost .    importantly ,",
    "in between of the layers the most preferable orientation of the molecules is mainly perpendicular to the wall .",
    "it means that the molecules located between the layers construct some kind of bridges between them .",
    "this phenomena can be important for stability of the layered structure .",
