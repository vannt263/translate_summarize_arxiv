    "thin position is a knot invariant first introduced by gabai @xcite to prove property @xmath4 . since then it has become of significant interest in its own right .",
    "the idea is to consider a knot in @xmath1 in morse position with respect to the standard height function and then to isotope the knot so that if we consider a maximal collection of level spheres no two of which are parallel in the knot complement , the sum of their intersections with the knot is minimized .",
    "a level sphere is called thin if it intersects the knot in fewer points than the two level spheres adjacent to it do .",
    "one of the interesting problems is establishing the compressibility properties of the level spheres in the knot complement . the first result in this direction",
    "was given by thompson .",
    "in @xcite she showed that if the knot is in thin position and has some thin spheres , its complement contains an incompressible , non - boundary parallel planar surface .",
    "the result was refined by wu @xcite who identified the thin level sphere of minimum width to be such an incompressible surface . in @xcite",
    "the current author gave further restrictions on the possible compressing disks for the thin spheres .",
    "recently , it has proven useful to consider not only compressing disks for surfaces in the knot complement but also cut - disks . these are annuli in the knot complement that have one boundary component lying in the surface considered and the other in the boundary of a regular neighborhood of the knot so that the interior of the annulus is disjoint from the surface and it is not parallel in the knot complement to an annulus on the surface . the precise definition is given later .",
    "surfaces that do not have cut - disks can be very useful ; for example if @xmath5 is a meridional surface with no cut - disks and no compressing disks and @xmath6 is any other meridional surface in the knot complement , then there is an isotopy after which all curves of @xmath7 are essential in @xmath6 .",
    "as one may expect , there are fewer obstructions to a level sphere having cut - disks than having compressing disks .",
    "one reason for that is that a compressing disk allows us to perform isotopies in one of the two balls bounded by the union of the compressing disk and the level sphere without affecting the other ball .",
    "when we are considering a cut - disks such isotopies generally create new critical points in the arc of the knot that pierces the cut - disk thus affecting the width of the knot in ways that are difficult to track . in this paper we have resolved this problem with the additional hypothesis that the cut - disk is vertical with respect to the height function , i.e. , the cut - disk can be isotoped in the knot complement to be the union of a vertical annulus , possibly once - punctured by the knot , and a possibly once - punctured level disk .",
    "we will show that the thin sphere of lowest width does not have any vertical cut - disks .",
    "in addition we extend some of the previously known results about compressing disks for level sphere for a knot in thin position to tangles in thin position .",
    "in this paper a _ link _ is a closed 1-manifold with one or more components that is embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that links can not be split , i.e. , there is no @xmath8-sphere in @xmath1 that separates the components of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a meridional surface embedded in the complement of a link @xmath0 .",
    "a _ cut - disk _ for @xmath5 is a disk @xmath9 such that @xmath10 , @xmath11 and the annulus @xmath12 is not parallel in the link complement to a subset of @xmath13 . in particular if @xmath0 is prime @xmath14 is not parallel to a boundary component of @xmath13 .",
    "we use the term _ c - disk _ to refer to either a compressing or a cut - disk .",
    "a c - disk is vertical with respect to a height function if it is the union of a vertical annulus and a level disk either one of which , but not both , may be punctured by the knot once .",
    "consider a height function @xmath15 such that @xmath16 restricts to a morse function on @xmath0 . if @xmath17 is a regular value of @xmath18 , @xmath19",
    "is called a level sphere with width @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 are all the critical values of @xmath18 , choose regular values @xmath22 such that @xmath23 .",
    "then the _ width of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath16 _ is defined by @xmath24 .",
    "the _ width _ of @xmath0 , @xmath25 is the minimum of @xmath26 over all possible height functions @xmath27 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is in thin position whenever we consider @xmath0 with respect to a height function @xmath16 which realizes its width , i.e. , if @xmath28 .",
    "instead of considering all possible height functions of @xmath1 we can consider all possible isotopic images of @xmath0 .",
    "the height function @xmath16 suggests an isotopy @xmath29 of @xmath1 such that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the standard height function on @xmath1 , namely the projection onto the third coordinate .",
    "we will take this point of view for the rest of the paper and will assume that @xmath16 is the standard height function on @xmath1 .",
    "more details about thin position and basic results can be found in @xcite .    a level sphere",
    "@xmath19 is called _ thin _ if the highest critical point for @xmath0 below it is a maximum and the lowest critical point above it is a minimum .",
    "if the highest critical point for @xmath0 below @xmath19 is a minimum and the lowest critical point above it is a maximum the level sphere is called _ thick_. as the lowest critical point of @xmath0 is a minimum and the highest is a maximum , a thick level sphere can always be found .",
    "it is possible that the link does not have any thin spheres with respects to some height function and in this case the link is said to be in _",
    "bridge position_.    clearly there are multiple isotopic images of a link all giving the same width .",
    "we will need to take advantage of these so we give a precise definition of such isotopies .    an isotopy that , in the end , leaves @xmath18 unchanged",
    "is called level preserving .",
    "an isotopy that leaves @xmath18 unchanged throughout the isotopy will be called a horizontal isotopy .",
    "since @xmath0 is in general position with respect to @xmath16 it is disjoint from both the minimum ( south pole ) and maximum ( north pole ) of @xmath16 on @xmath32 .",
    "thus the width of @xmath0 could just as easily be computed via its diffeomorphic image in @xmath33 .",
    "as @xmath0 is compact we may in fact assume that @xmath0 is contained in @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "finally , by general position , @xmath0 is disjoint from some fiber of @xmath34 $ ] so we can also regard it as contained in the ball @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "we will use all of these points of view and continue to use @xmath16 to denote the projection onto the third coordinate .",
    "when we consider @xmath0 to lie in @xmath35 $ ] , the preimages @xmath19 are level disks which can be thin , thick or neither depending on the corresponding level spheres .",
    "similarly the width of a level disk will be the width of the corresponding level sphere and a disk in @xmath35 $ ] is a c - disk for a level disk if it is a c - disk for the corresponding level sphere .",
    "a tangle in @xmath3 $ ] is a properly embedded one manifold with possibly multiple components .",
    "we compute the width of a tangle analogously to the width of a link .",
    "the two level sphere @xmath36 and @xmath37 will be considered to be thin if the highest critical point of @xmath0 is a maximum and the lowest one is a minimum .",
    "when we consider the tangle to lie in @xmath38 $ ] as we did with links , it is important to perform all isotopies keeping the endpoints in @xmath39 so the isotopies make sense as isotopies of @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "unless otherwise specified we will use @xmath0 to denote either a link or a tangle that we consider as a tangle in @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "we will use @xmath40 for tangles that are embedded in a ball and thus isotopies moving their endpoints on the boundary sphere will be allowed .",
    "in this paper @xmath0 will denote an unsplit link ( possibly with only one component ) or an unsplit tangle embedded in @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 will denote a level sphere for @xmath0 and @xmath43 will be a c - disk for @xmath42 . without loss of generality",
    "we will assume that @xmath44 and @xmath43 lies above @xmath42 .",
    "consider a closed regular neighborhood of @xmath43 , @xmath45 $ ] that is sufficiently small so that if @xmath43 is a compressing disk @xmath46 and if @xmath43 is a cut - disk @xmath47 and @xmath48 has no critical points .",
