    "entanglement is one of the most fundamental features of quantum mechanics , yet in some ways the most mysterious . in this talk",
    "i will discuss some of the recent developments in understanding its role in many - body systems extended in space , focussing on two main topics : the universal properties of entanglement entropy near quantum critical points , and the behaviour of entanglement , and , more generally , correlation functions , after what is termed a ` quantum quench ' .",
    "most of the work i will be presenting was carried out in collaboration with p.  calabrese @xcite and others . for a more general perspective",
    "the reader is referred to a recent review by amico _",
    "_ @xcite . _ _",
    "consider a general quantum system prepared in a pure state @xmath0 , so that it has density matrix @xmath1 .",
    "we suppose that the hilbert space can be written as a direct product @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we imagine two observers ( traditionally named alice and bob ) such that alice can make observations only in @xmath3 ( that is corresponding to linear operators of the form @xmath4 ) , and correspondingly for bob . in general alice s observations",
    "are entangled with those of bob .",
    "one of the most useful mathematical results in understanding how to quantify entanglement is that of schmidt decomposition , which is based on the property of singular value decomposition for matrices .",
    "it states that any pure state @xmath0 may be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 are orthonormal states in @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , and @xmath9 .",
    "moreover the @xmath10 can be chosen to be real and @xmath11 .",
    "( note that there is only one sum here : for each state in @xmath3 there is just one state in @xmath8 . )",
    "one measure of the entanglement in @xmath0 is the _ entropy _",
    "@xmath12 if @xmath13 and all the rest vanish , @xmath0 is a product state and is unentangled ( although there may still be classical correlations . )",
    "if , on the other hand , all the @xmath10 are equal , then @xmath14 takes its maximal value , given by the logarithm of the smaller of the dimensions of @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "for example , if each space is a direct product of @xmath15 qubits ( spin @xmath16 degrees of freedom ) then the maximal entanglement entropy is @xmath17 . _ _    equivalently , we can define the entanglement entropy as the von neumann entropy @xmath18 of alice s density matrix @xmath19 .",
    ".    other measures of entanglement exist @xcite , but the entropy has several nice properties : additivity , convexity , basis independence . in quantum information theory @xcite , it gives the maximum efficiency of conversion of partially entangled to maximally entangled states that alice can achieve using only local operations in her part of the hilbert space . from a computational point of view , it gives the amount of classical information required to specify the reduced density matrix @xmath21 .",
    "this important , for example , in the density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) .",
    "however , in this talk i want to use the entanglement entropy as a basis - independent means of characterising quantum phase transitions .",
    "this is particularly important in those cases where it is not clear what the order parameter is , or which correlation functions should become long - ranged at the transition .",
    "( indeed , for topological transitions there may be no identifiable order parameter . )",
    "i shall consider the case when the degrees of freedom of the quantum system are distributed over some large region @xmath22 in @xmath23-dimensional euclidean space , and the hamiltonian @xmath24 contains only short - range interactions , for example a quantum spin system , or , more generally a uv - cutoff quantum field theory .",
    "( i shall focus solely on the universal properties near the phase transition : these , as k.  wilson and others taught us , are all encoded in the field theory description . )",
    "the subspace @xmath7 will consist of the degrees of freedom in some large ( compact ) subset a of @xmath25 , and we shall assume that the whole system is in a pure state , usually the ground state @xmath26 of @xmath24 .",
    "however , it will be useful also to consider the case when the whole system is in a thermal mixed state with @xmath27 .",
    "the main question i will address is how the entanglement entropy depends on the size and geometry of the region a , and on the universality class of the critical behaviour .",
    "_ `` quantum mechanics is just statistical mechanics in one more dimension '' _",
    "fisher ) _ _    from an analytic perspective , the schmidt decomposition is very difficult to carry out except in simple cases , and we employ a different route via the path integral . as feynman taught us , the thermal density matrix @xmath28 may be written as a path integral in an imaginary time interval @xmath29 ( throughout we adopt units with @xmath30 . )",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    the density matrix is correctly normalised by the partition function @xmath31 as shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .    however , we need the reduced density matrix @xmath21 .",
    "this is found by sewing together only those parts of the upper and lower edges corresponding to the region b ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .    in order to compute the entropy @xmath18 we use a device reminiscent of the ` replica trick ' in disordered systems : we compute @xmath32 for positive integral @xmath33 , analytically continue in @xmath33 , and evaluate @xmath34 for positive integer @xmath33 , this is given by taking @xmath33 copies of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and sewing the edges along a in a cyclic fashion , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    for @xmath35 ( which is the case we shall consider here )",
    "this expresses @xmath32 as a path integral on an @xmath33-sheeted riemann surface , with branch points at the ends of the interval a ( if a has several disjoint parts , there are several branch points . )      before proceeding further , it worth understanding how this formalism gives the expected answer at high temperatures .",
    "consider the case where a is an interval of length @xmath36 in a system of total length @xmath37 , with @xmath38 .",
    "further suppose that @xmath39 .",
    "the path integral is then over a very narrow cylinder ( compared to its length ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .    in this limit",
    "we expect the result of the path integral to factorise : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the partition function for a system of length @xmath37 at inverse temperature @xmath42 .",
    "thus @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the usual helmholtz free energy of region a. differentiating with respect to @xmath33 at @xmath45 , we then find @xmath46 this shows that in this limit , the von neumann entropy becomes the usual thermodynamic entropy , as expected .",
    "suppose the 1@xmath23 system is at a quantum critical point with dynamic exponent @xmath47 ( that is , linear dispersion relation @xmath48 at low energies )",
    ". then dimensional analysis ( with @xmath49 ) implies that @xmath50 .",
    "this is just the one - dimensional version of stefan s law : the constant @xmath51 for a single species of boson .",
    "we conclude that for @xmath52 @xmath53\\,.\\ ] ] the above considerations do not appear to shed much light on the case we wish to consider , namely zero temperature .",
    "however , in this case the limit @xmath52 is related to the opposite one @xmath54 by _ conformal symmetry _ _ : the mapping @xmath55 converts exponential decay along the cylinder into power law decay at @xmath56 .",
    "thus , at zero temperature we have @xmath57 taking the derivative we see that @xmath58 for a general conformal field theory ( cft ) , @xmath59 is the central charge . ( [ sa ] )",
    "was first found in 1994 by holzhey _",
    "@xcite , who called it the geometric entropy .",
    "_ _ _ _ _    note that this implies that , even at a quantum critical point , the entropy grows only logarithmically in the length @xmath36 , as opposed to its maximum allowed behaviour which is @xmath60 .",
    "this accounts for the success of the dmrg method in @xmath35 .",
    "this logarithmic growth is apparently not restricted to critical points with @xmath47 : for example it also holds in random spin chains @xcite .",
    "( [ sa ] ) is just one example of a plethora of universal results which can be found using cft methods .",
    "for example , one can explore the cross - over between finite and zero temperature when @xmath61 to find the elegant formula @xcite @xmath62      the above cft considerations apply only at the quantum critical point .",
    "however , the behaviour of the entanglement entropy close to such a point may be deduced from this by scaling arguments .",
    "for example , consider the case when a is an interval of length @xmath36 in an infinite system ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "when the correlation length @xmath63 is finite and @xmath64 , we expect that the entanglement arises from regions of length @xmath65 near the boundaries between a and b. since the scaling at the critical point is logarithmic we may therefore conjecture that , in this limit , @xmath66 and that in general there is a contribution @xmath67 from each contact point between a and b. for the case of a single such point , when a and b are both semi - infinite lines , this has been derived exactly using the corner transfer matrix @xcite , for a large class of integrable models .",
    "recently the leading corrections to ( [ sa2 ] ) have been computed @xcite . these are of the form @xmath68 and they appear to be rather universal .      in higher dimensions ,",
    "the natural conjecture for the entanglement entropy ( given that @xmath70 should equal @xmath71 ) is that it is proportional to the ` area ' @xmath72 of the boundary between the two regions .",
    "this has been verified in various models ( although logarithmic factors are also possible ) and even proved rigorously @xcite starting from reasonable assumptions about the behaviour of correlations . on dimensional grounds",
    "the coefficient of the area law should go as @xmath73 where is @xmath74 is the short - distance cutoff , and therefore be non - universal .",
    "however , renormalisation group arguments similar to those used to analyse the scaling behaviour of the free energy imply that there should be a universal term proportional to @xmath75 hidden behind this @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that these area - dependent terms may cancel in more complicated entanglement combinations .",
    "for example , if a and b are different subregions of @xmath25 , then one may conjecture that @xmath76 is universal , and , at the critical point , depends only on the geometry and some universal constants of the critical theory .",
    "in the second part of this talk i want to discuss a subject which is intimately related to entanglement properties of quantum many - body systems , but is somewhat more general .",
    "let us suppose that we prepare a system at time @xmath77 in a pure state @xmath78 , which we usually take to be the ground state of some translationally invariant hamiltonian @xmath79 with a gap @xmath80 to the first excited state . for times",
    "@xmath81 we then evolve the state according to a _ different _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath24 ( which does nt commute with @xmath79 ) .",
    "note that this evolution is _ unitary _ _ : no dissipation or noise .",
    "this protocol has been termed a ` quantum quench ' . _ _ _ _ _    we may then ask how the reduced density matrix @xmath21 of some finite part of the system , its entropy @xmath70 and correlation functions of local operators @xmath82 with @xmath83 evolve .",
    "in particular , does @xmath21 reach a stationary state , and if so how is it characterised ?    for traditional solid state systems",
    "the assumption of unitary evolution usually breaks down so rapidly that these kind of questions have hardly been addressed in the past , except in a few cases of integrable spin chains @xcite .",
    "however recent experiments on cold atoms in optical lattices have shown that it is possible to maintain coherence over measurable time intervals .",
    "this has prompted more recent work , both in integrable systems and more generally @xcite .",
    "these detailed considerations all lead to the prediction of the following rather simple physical effects .      since @xmath78 has ( extensively ) higher energy than the ground state of @xmath24 , it acts as a source of quasiparticles of @xmath24 .",
    "the analysis of simple models shows that subsequently they move classically .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , for the simplest case in @xmath35 when all particles travel at the same speed @xmath84 .",
    "entanglement between regions a and b ( which is very small initially ) arises when two entangled particles emitted from nearby points arrive on a and b respectively . from the upper diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , corresponding to early times @xmath85 , we see that the number of such pairs of particles , and therefore the degree of entanglement , increases linearly with @xmath86 .",
    "one the other hand for @xmath87 is saturates at a value proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "this is what is found in explicit calculations .",
    "the coefficient of the linear term depends on the initial state .",
    "in general it is found that one - point functions @xmath88 of local operators ( for example spins in a quantum spin chain where @xmath78 breaks the spin - reversal symmetry but @xmath24 and its ground state do not ) , decay exponentially fast towards their values in the ground state of @xmath24 .",
    "the physical reason for this is illustrated in fig .  [ fig9 ] .    on the other hand the behaviour of a two - point function @xmath89 is governed by the horizon effect . up to time @xmath90 its connected part does not change from its initial form which is very short - ranged . for wider separations",
    "@xmath91 , which decays exponentially in time .",
    "at the time @xmath92 the two points fall inside the horizon and the connected correlation function becomes non - zero . in the case",
    "when all quasiparticles have the same speed , the full correlation function then becomes time - independent , and , since it was previously decaying exponentially with @xmath86 , now exhibits exponential decay in the separation @xmath93 .",
    "these physical considerations allow us to understand the behaviour in more realistic situations where lattice effects or a gap modify the dispersion relation .",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the fact that the quasiparticles , once emitted , travel classically means that it is their group velocity which is important .",
    "since this can vanish , for example at the zone boundary , this is responsible for a very slow ( power law + oscillations ) approach to the asymptotic limit at large @xmath86 , which is actually seen in exact calculations and numerical work .",
    "we have argued that calculations in various solvable models suggest that correlation functions for @xmath83 , and by implication the reduced density matrix @xmath21 , become stationary at late times .",
    "but what is their form ? in these cases",
    "it turns out that , at least in the case where the gap @xmath80 in the spectrum of @xmath79 is large , @xmath21 has a _ thermal _ form @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is an effective temperature dependent on @xmath80 among other things . _",
    "_    in order to understand this , first consider a very simple example : a simple harmonic oscillator quenched from frequency @xmath96 ( and initially in the ground state ) , to frequency @xmath97 .",
    "it is a simple calculation to evaluate the overlap between the ground state @xmath78 and a typical eigenstate of @xmath24 with energy @xmath98 . for @xmath99",
    "we find @xmath100 where @xmath101 , so the matrix elements of the time - dependent density matrix have the form @xmath102 note that since the energy differences are all multiples of @xmath97 , @xmath103 does not tend towards a stationary value ",
    "it oscillates as expected !    however in an extensive system , which we can consider as a set of oscillators , one for each quasiparticle mode @xmath104 ,",
    "if we consider a finite region a of size @xmath105 as @xmath106 , we need to integrate over all the @xmath104-modes .",
    "if the dispersion relation has the form @xmath107 the different modes destructively interfere except at @xmath108 .",
    "the result is that correlation functions , and @xmath109 , become stationary as @xmath106 as if they were at finite temperature .",
    "in fact a more careful calculation , valid not just in the large @xmath80 limit , gives @xmath110 similarly , we find that the extensive part of @xmath70 saturates at a value equal to the thermodynamic entropy at this effective temperature .",
    "although the above simple argument relied on a non - zero gap @xmath111 , in fact ( as long as interactions are present ) the above result appears to hold ( for example in a cft in 1 + 1 dimensions ) even in the gapless case .",
    "it should be stressed that this effective thermalisation occurs despite the fact that the system as a whole remains in a pure state , and there is no ergodicity or coupling to a heat bath  the effect arises solely as a consequence of quantum interference and entanglement .      in this",
    "talk i have argued ( a ) that entanglement entropy provides a useful order - parameter independent diagnostic of quantum phase transitions , with many universal features , and ( b ) that after a quantum quench , there are interesting transient phenomena like the horizon effect , and that at late times finite regions should behave as though they are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "there are many open questions , particularly in regard to part ( b ) , and whether it holds only for theories which admit a quasiparticle picture .",
    "in addition , these kinds of calculations need to be repeated for more realistic models , and also for quenches through the critical point into an ordered phase , where the relation to later - time coarsening effects needs to be understood .",
