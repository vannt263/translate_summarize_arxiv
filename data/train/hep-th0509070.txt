    "the conjectured correspondences  @xcite between certain string theories and supersymmetric yang  mills ( sym ) theories at large-@xmath2 can be tested directly if one is able to solve an sym theory at strong coupling .",
    "the solution can then be compared to a small - curvature supergravity approximation to the corresponding string theory .",
    "this approach requires a nonperturbative technique for sym theories , and one has been developed over the past several years as a supersymmetric form  @xcite of discrete light - cone quantization  @xcite , known as sdlcq .",
    "the sdlcq approach is a hamiltonian formulation in a fock basis using light - cone coordinates  @xcite .",
    "the choice of coordinates allows for a simple vacuum and a consistent fock expansion .",
    "the momentum - space wave functions in the different fock sectors then satisfy coupled integral equations which can be discretized to obtain a matrix representation of the bound - state eigenvalue problem .",
    "the discretization is actually done at the level of second - quantized operators expanded in momentum modes ; however , this ultimately yields the same matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "the quantity which we compute in order to test a correspondence is a two - point correlator of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "the correlator is computed in sdlcq by inserting a sum over the eigenstates obtained in the matrix diagonalization . to keep the calculation manageable",
    ", we consider the case of @xmath0 sym theory in two dimensions which corresponds to a particular type iib string theory  @xcite . the supergravity approximation to the correlator",
    "is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the potential for an sdlcq check of this correspondence was explored there and in subsequent work  @xcite , but the numerical resolution available in this earlier work was insufficient for a true test .",
    "we have now reached a resolution sufficient to provide evidence of consistency in the correspondence  @xcite .",
    "an outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : sdlcq ] describes the sdlcq method .",
    "the particular sym theory is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : sym ] , and the calculation of the correlator is formulated in sec .",

    "we use light - cone coordinates as suggested by dirac  @xcite . the time coordinate is @xmath6 , and the space coordinate is @xmath7 .",
    "the conjugate variables are the light - cone energy @xmath8 and momentum @xmath9 .",
    "the mass - shell condition @xmath10 then yields @xmath11    the discretization proposed by pauli and brodsky  @xcite , known as discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq )  @xcite , is based on the imposition of periodic boundary conditions on a light - cone box @xmath12 .",
    "this yields a discrete grid in momentum space where individual momenta are specified by @xmath13 , with @xmath14 a positive integer . for fixed total momentum @xmath15 , the limit",
    "@xmath16 is exchanged for a limit in terms of the integer resolution @xmath17 .",
    "since the individual momenta are strictly positive , @xmath18 is the upper limit on the number of particles allowed by the discretization .",
    "integrals are replaced by discrete sums dp^+ f(p^+ ) _ n",
    "f(n / l ) , and dirac delta functions become kronecker deltas ( p^+-p^+)_nn.    supersymmetric dlcq ( sdlcq )  @xcite is constructed  @xcite to maintain the supersymmetry algebra \\{q^+,q^+}&=&2p^+ , + \\{q^-,q^-}&=&2p^- , + \\{q^+,q^-}&=&-4p_. this algebra is satisfied explicitly by first discretizing the supercharge @xmath19 and computing p_sdlcq^-=\\{q^-,q^-}. in ordinary dlcq , the @xmath20 operator is discretized directly and the supersymmetry algebra is not satisfied , except in the limit of infinite resolution . by preserving the supersymmetry algebra , sdlcq preserves supersymmetry in the spectrum , even at finite resolution .",
    "the @xmath21=(8,8 ) sym theory is obtained by reducing @xmath22 sym theory from ten to two dimensions .",

    "the two - component spinor fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 are remnants of the right - moving and left - moving projections of the original sixteen - component spinor .",

    "the errors in the extrapolations remain too large to support a claim of computing the expected @xmath4 behavior , but the numerical evidence is consistent .",
