    "there is an important class of computer programs that do calculations in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in which the calculation is performed at next - to - leading order in perturbation theory and allows for the determination of a variety of characteristics of the final state .",
    "this paper concerns a significant technical issue that arises in such programs when a `` completely numerical '' integration algorithm is used : how should one choose the integration points ?",
    "i consider the calculation of `` three - jet - like '' observables in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "a given program in the class considered can be used to calculate a jet cross section ( with any infrared safe choice of jet definition ) or observables like the thrust distribution .",
    "such a program generates random partonic events consisting of three or four final state quarks , antiquarks , and gluons .",
    "each event comes with a calculated weight .",
    "a separate routine then calculates the contribution to the desired observable for each event , averaging over the events with their weights .",
    "the weights are treated as probabilities . however , these weights can be both positive or negative .",
    "this is an almost inevitable consequence of quantum mechanics .",
    "the calculated observable is proportional to the square of a quantum amplitude and is thus positive .",
    "however , as soon as one divides the amplitude into pieces for purposes of calculation , one finds that while the square of each piece is positive , the interference terms between different pieces can have either sign",
    ". thus the kind of program discussed here stands in contrast to the tree - level event generators in which , by simplifying the physics , one can generally arrange to have all the weights be positive , or , even , to be all equal to 1 .    to understand the algorithms used in the class of programs described above , it is best to think of the programs as performing integrations over momenta in which the quantum matrix elements and the measurement functions form the integrand .",
    "there are two basic algorithms for performing the integrations .",
    "the older is due to ellis , ross , and terrano ( ert ) @xcite .",
    "( the first general purpose implementation of this method for three - jet - like observables in @xmath1 annihilation was that of kunszt and nason @xcite ) . in this method ,",
    "some of the integrations are performed analytically ahead of time .",
    "the other integrations are performed numerically by the monte carlo method .",
    "the integrations are divergent and are regulated by analytical continuation to @xmath2 space dimensions and a scheme of subtractions or cutoffs .",
    "the second method is much newer @xcite . in this method ,",
    "all of the integrations are done by monte carlo numerical integration . with this method ,",
    "the integrals are all convergent ( after removal of the ultraviolet divergences by a straightforward renormalization procedure ) .",
    "since this method is quite new , one can not yet say for what problems it might do better than the now standard ert method .",
    "i can point out that the current incarnation of the numerical method has convergence problems for three jet quantities that receive important contributions from final states that are close to the two jet limit .",
    "for example , one gets good results for the three jet cross section or for the thrust distribution away from @xmath3 , but poorly converging results for the energy - energy correlation function . on the other hand ,",
    "the numerical method offers evident advantages in flexibility to modify the integrand .",
    "thus one should be able to attack problems that are not accessible to the ert method .",
    "the numerical integration method exists as computer code @xcite with accompanying technical notes @xcite and many of the basic ideas behind it have been described in the two papers @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to an exposition of the choice of integration points needed for this method .",
    "this subject may seem unimportant .",
    "furthermore , it may seem to be a just a part of the numerical algorithms branch of computer science and thus to be uninteresting from the point of view of physics .",
    "however , practitioners of the art of numerical integrations in physics know that the choice of integration points is extremely important .",
    "if everything else is perfect but the integration points are badly chosen , the computer will , like sisyphus , be faced with an unending task because the precision of the answer will not improve as the computational time increases .",
    "furthermore , the problem is a problem in physics .",
    "all that the theory of numerical integration tells us is that the density of integration points should be well matched to the structure of the function to be integrated .",
    "the function to be integrated comes from feynman diagrams , so we are really faced with the problem of understanding the structure of the quantum scattering processes . perhaps surprisingly , the aspects of quantum scattering that are important in numerical method are completely different than the aspects that are important in the ert method .    in sec .",
    "ii below , i briefly review the basics of the numerical integration method with the aim of setting the notation and making it possible to read this paper independently of the previous two papers .",
    "then , in the sections that follow , i turn to the main issue of this paper , the choice of integration points .",

    "the integration is often ultraviolet divergent , but the ultraviolet divergence is easily removed by a renormalization subtraction .",

    "thus we apply a _ 2 to 1 _ sampling method only in the case of a self - energy subgraph connected to a final state parton .    we will choose @xmath141 with a density that is a linear combination of five densities : @xmath329 here @xmath330 and @xmath331 are fixed positive parameters with @xmath332 also positive .    for @xmath333 we take @xmath334 the density @xmath335 is a simple variation on this with @xmath336 replaced by a scale @xmath337 : @xmath338 here @xmath339 , where the momenta of the particles in the final state are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath340 .",
    "the @xmath341 and @xmath335 terms provide singularities at @xmath342 and @xmath343 .",
    "the @xmath344 term provides a non - singular density of points in the neighborhood of the collinear line @xmath345 with @xmath346 .",
    "for @xmath347 we take @xmath348 here @xmath349 and @xmath350 are fixed parameters and @xmath217 and @xmath351 are defined by writing @xmath352 where @xmath353 is the part of @xmath141 that is orthogonal to @xmath60 .",
    "in a next - to - leading order calculation of three jet cross sections and similar observables in electron - positron annihilation , a given graph leads to several contributions to the cross section .",
    "each of these contributions has the form of a measurement function times a quantum amplitude times a complex conjugate amplitude , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutdiagrams ] .",
    "we must integrate the sum of these contributions over three loop momenta . in this paper ,",
    "i have presented a method for sampling the space of loop momenta in order to perform the integrations by the monte carlo method .",
    "the main organizing principle for this sampling is to construct the density of integration points as a sum and to have one or more terms in this sum correspond to each possible three parton final state for the graph .",
    "a cut graph with a three parton final state has a virtual loop .",
    "we are thus led to consider a simple problem in quantum mechanics : where in the space of the loop momentum are the singularities for two body to @xmath4 body scatterings ?",
    "the generic answer is that the singularities lie on ellipsoidal surfaces .",
    "this leads us to choose elliptical / hyperbolic coordinates for the loop momentum space . for the most part , we avoid letting the integrand be truly singular at these surfaces by giving the loop momentum a suitable imaginary part according to the contour deformation recipe of ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , it is helpful to make the density of integration points large near these ellipsoidal surfaces .",
    "we are left with special points on the scattering singularity surfaces where the contour deformation vanishes , so that the integrand is actually singular .",
    "this singularity corresponds to soft parton exchange and is significant in gauge field theories .",
    "we have seen how to give the density of points a singularity structure that matches that of the integrand as one approaches a soft singularity .",
    "the sampling method that has been described here is far from optimal .",
    "it is , however , at least reasonably systematic , and it gives good results for three jet observables that do not get significant contributions from parton final states that are near to two jet configurations .",
