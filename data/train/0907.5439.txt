    "the texts @xcite contain much of the theory of set - valued analysis .",
    "set - valued analysis serves as a foundation for the theory of differential inclusions @xcite , control theory @xcite and variational analysis @xcite , which in turn have many applications in applied mathematics .",
    "we refer to these texts for the abundant bibliography on the history of set - valued analysis .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new concept of generalized differentiation ( definitions [ def : set - valued - diff ] and [ def : pseudo - t - diff ] ) using positively homogeneous maps .",
    "any reasonable definition of a derivative for set - valued maps has to describe changes in the set in terms of the input variables . using the pompieu - hausdorff distance ( a metric on the space of nonempty compact sets ) ,",
    "one obtains the classical definition of lipschitz continuity of set - valued maps .",
    "the concept introduced in this paper provides a more precise tool that incoporates first order information in a set - valued map , encompassing the standard notions of frchet differentiability , strict differentiability , calmness and lipschitz continuity in single - valued maps , and the aubin property and lipschitz continuity in set - valued maps .",
    "we illustrate how this new concept relates to , and extends , existing methods in variational and set - valued analysis .",
    "to motivate our discussion , we revisit the relation between the clarke subdifferential and clarke jacobian and the nonsmooth behavior of functions that can be traced back to @xcite .",
    "other than the first four sections which provide the necessary background for the rest of the paper , the last four sections can be read in any order . in section [ sec : single - valued - diff ] , we recall generalized differentiation for single - valued functions , which was first proposed by ioffe @xcite .",
    "we relate the generalized derivative to common notions in classical and variational analysis , paying particular attention to the clarke subdifferential and the clarke jacobian . in section [ sec",
    ": set - valued - diff ] , we define generalized differentiation for set - valued maps , and illustrate the lack of relation between our generalized derivatives and the notions of set - valued derivatives based on the tangent cones , namely semidifferentiability @xcite and proto - differentiability @xcite .",
    "we present calculus rules in section [ sec : calculus ] .",
    "the aubin property ( see definition [ def : calm - aubin ] ) , which is commonly attributed to @xcite , is a method of analyzing local lipschitz continuity of set - valued maps . in section [ sec :",
    "boris - extended ] , we revisit the classical relationship between the aubin property and the coderivatives of a set - valued map . this relationship is referred to as the mordukhovich criterion in @xcite .",
    "since the coderivatives of a set - valued map can be calculated in many applications and enjoy an effective calculus , this relationship is an important tool in the study of the lipschitz properties of set - valued maps .",
    "we will show that the coderivatives actually give more information on the local lipschitz continuity property in our language of generalized derivatives .",
    "it is well known that the aubin property is related to metric regularity and open covering @xcite .",
    "open covering is sometimes known as linear openness .",
    "metric regularity is important in the analysis of solutions to @xmath5 , while open covering studies local covering properties of a set - valued map .",

    "[ sec : extended - metric - regularity ] , we take a new look at metric regularity and open covering in view of our definitions of the generalized derivatives .",
    "we study metric regularity and open covering in a much broader framework , illustrating that a directional behavior similar to that in our definition of generalized derivatives is present in metric regularity and open covering .",
    "in section [ sec : strict  t - from - t ] , we discuss how the ( basic and strict ) generalized derivatives defined in sections [ sec : single - valued - diff ] and [ sec : set - valued - diff ] relate to each other .",

    "<S> we propose a new concept of generalized differentiation of set - valued maps that captures first order information . </S>",
    "<S> this concept encompasses the standard notions of frchet differentiability , strict differentiability , calmness and lipschitz continuity in single - valued maps , and the aubin property and lipschitz continuity in set - valued maps . </S>",
    "<S> we present calculus rules , sharpen the relationship between the aubin property and coderivatives , and study how metric regularity and open covering can be refined to have a directional property similar to our concept of generalized differentiation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the relationship between the robust form of generalized differentiation and its one sided counterpart . </S>"
