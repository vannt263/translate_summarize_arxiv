    "radiative transfer is an important piece of physics to describe how an astronomical object is observed .",
    "also the radiation often affects dynamical behavior of the astronomical object .",
    "thus it has been studied in many astrophysical fields .",
    "however , the radiative transfer equation is intrinsically a 6-dimensional boltzmann equation that is computationally expensive .",
    "therefore , the radiative transfer equation is frequently solved in a simplified and approximated form appropriate for an object of interest .",
    "methods for the multidimensional radiative transfer and radiation hydrodynamics are developed in various fields , e.g. , cosmological structure formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a stellar and solar atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a terrestrial atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these methods are optimized for individual research fields and involve various sophisticated physics for individual phenomena , e.g. , a chemical network for cosmological structure formation and star formation , fine - structure lines for a stellar and solar atmosphere , and molecular lines and scattering by dust for a terrestrial atmosphere . on the other hand ,",
    "they ignore terms with higher orders than @xmath0 , i.e. , they assume that a fluid velocity is much slower than the light velocity .",
    "this is a commonly - used appropriate assumption to simplify the radiative transfer equation but inapplicable for the radiative transfer in a relativistic flow .",
    "an emission from a relativistic flow recently attracts researchers with the advent of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) .",
    "the grb is a phenomenon emitting @xmath1-ray photons from relativistic jets in a short period and one of the brightest objects in the universe .",
    "the grbs have been detected in the distant universe with redshift as high as @xmath2 ( @xcite ; @xmath3 for a photometric redshift , @xcite ) and are believed to probe the high-@xmath4 universe as well as quasars and galaxies .",
    "furthermore , interestingly , it is observationally exhibited that the @xmath1-ray emission has correlations of spectral peak energy versus isotropic radiation energy @xcite and spectral peak energy versus peak luminosity @xcite .",
    "a correlation between x - ray luminosity at the break time and the break time is also suggested @xcite .",
    "these correlations make researchers think of that the grb can be a standardizable candle being detectable at higher redshift than type ia supernova ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the mechanism of grb prompt emission and the origin of correlations have been intensively studied .",
    "observationally , many satellites and telescopes report large variations of the prompt emission , for example , spectra with thermal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , non - thermal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and high - energy components ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , polarization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and duration ( e.g. , ultra - long grbs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a correlation between optical and @xmath1-ray light curves is also exhibited ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "theoretically , the emission mechanism has been investigated by analytic studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) or numerical studies with various assumptions : e.g. , superposing blackbody radiation from a scattering photosphere @xcite , solving a radiative transfer equation in a spherical steady flow @xcite , transferring photons in a steady flow with a relativistic monte carlo method ( @xcite ; s.  shibata & n.  tominaga in prep . ) , and calculating a spherical relativistic radiation hydrodynamics @xcite .    in spite of plenty observations and theoretical studies for many years , the mechanism of the grb prompt emission is still under debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is mainly because most of studies is restricted to be qualitative and there are few quantitative studies taking account of a structure of relativistic jets . in order to investigate the grb prompt emission quantitatively ,",
    "a multidimensional relativistic radiation hydrodynamics calculation is essentially required .",
    "this is because the grb is a relativistic and multidimensional phenomenon and the radiation , of which energy can dominate the matter energy , closely couples with matter .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to develop a radiative transfer code optimized for the grbs which fully includes the terms higher than @xmath0 .",
    "much progress is recently made on the multidimensional radiation hydrodynamics calculation , for example , ( 1 ) special relativistic 3-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamics @xcite , ( 2 ) general relativistic 3-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics @xcite , ( 3 ) 3-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamics @xcite , ( 4 ) relativistic monte carlo transport coupled with hydrodynamics @xcite , and ( 5 ) 3-dimensional special relativistic boltzmann hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "however , the calculations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are based on the m1 closure method , which can treat anisotropic radiation field but not intersecting radiation from various sources .",
    "this is not suitable for the grbs because the material , that is surrounding the relativistic jet , e.g. , a cocoon , is hot and emits thermal photons to varying directions .",
    "the calculation ( 3 ) adopts the variable eddington tensor ( vet ) method that can treat intersecting radiation from multiple sources and non - local radiation equilibrium , but ignores terms with orders higher than @xmath0 .",
    "recently , @xcite implements a radiative transfer code involving time dependence and velocity dependent source terms but the method is still accurate up to @xmath0 .",
    "the calculation ( 4 ) couples a relativistic monte carlo transport method implicitly with hydrodynamics solvers and the calculation ( 5 ) is , in particular , adopted for the neutrino transport in a collapsing massive star .",
    "although the calculations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) would be applicable for the grbs , the calculation ( 4 ) can involve a noise of the monte carlo even with a reducing technique they developed and the calculation ( 5 ) is time - consuming and might be difficult to increase the number of mesh points because it involves an inversion of a huge matrix .",
    "there are also general relativistic radiative transfer codes to describe emission from surroundings of black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the codes first derive photon geodesic trajectories in curved spacetime and integrate a relativistic radiative transfer equation along the geodesic paths .",
    "they also would be applicable for the grbs .",
    "however , they waste time and computational resources because it is only required to calculate the trajectory in the flat spacetime in the grbs .    in this paper , we develop an implicit time - dependent multi - group multidimensional special relativistic radiative transfer ( rrt ) code with the mixed - frame approach .",
    "the rrt code can calculate an eddington tensor with the intensity and thus could be the first step to a time - dependent special relativistic multidimensional multi - group radiation hydrodynamics code optimized for the grbs .",
    "the rrt code is based on the spherical harmonic discrete ordinate method ( shdom ) and takes into account ray tracing , time dependence , lorentz transformation , elastic thomson and inelastic compton scattering .",
    "we present numerical test problems with the rrt code .",
    "we describe the method in section  [ sec : method ] and present test problems in section  [ sec : test ] .",
    "the results are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the rrt code is based on spherical harmonic discrete ordinate method ( shdom , @xcite ) code which is a publicly - available static monochromatic radiation transfer code solving the following equation with the @xmath5 iteration ( picard iteration ) method .",
    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 is a total path along a ray , is direction of travel of the photon , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are an intensity , an extinction coefficient , and an emission coefficient at frequency @xmath11 , respectively . here , the extinction coefficient is the net absorption coefficient of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are absorption and scattering coefficients , respectively .",
    "the shdom code is originally developed for radiative transfer in the terrestrial atmosphere and thus correctly treats anisotropic source terms including emission and scattering with spherical harmonics .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : shdom ] ) is integrated for each ray described with discrete ordinates ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) with short characteristic method ( ray tracing ) .",
    "the shdom code transforms an intensity and a source function between spherical harmonics and discrete ordinates at every time step .",
    "the scheme of the shdom code , including the transformation between spherical harmonics and discrete ordinates , the ray tracing , and so on , is comprehensively described and validated in @xcite and @xcite .    in order to apply the shdom code to a special relativistic phenomenon , especially a grb , the following processes and physics",
    "are necessary to be included : ( 1 ) time dependence because a time step is needed to be short enough to capture a relativistic fluid that moves as fast as the light speed , i.e. , the light - crossing time is as long as the characteristic dynamical time , ( 2 ) lorentz transformation between laboratory and comoving frames which results in relativistic beaming and a variation of photon frequencies , and ( 3 ) anisotropic and inelastic compton scattering because the photon energy is comparable with the electron rest - mass energy , thus the assumption of thomson scattering is not valid , and the scattering dominates the opacity in the relativistic jets of grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we set a computational domain to be translationally symmetric along the @xmath17 axis but the ray of radiation is solved in three dimension and described with polar coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the coordinates are set to have zenith direction of the @xmath4 axis and azimuth angle measured from the @xmath18 axis to the @xmath17 axis .",
    "the radiative transfer equation is solved with the mixed - frame approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the photon ray is traced in the laboratory frame and the source term is evaluated in the comoving frame .",
    "in addition to the above implementation , we update the ray tracing scheme to a cubic bezier interpolant method @xcite and include an acceleration scheme of the @xmath5 iteration ( ng acceleration , @xcite ) , but omit the adaptive treatment of mesh points and the parallelization with message passing interface ( mpi ) for simplicity in this paper .      a time - dependent radiative transfer equation is written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the light speed . a finite difference approximation to the time derivative",
    "is written as @xmath21 the time - dependent radiative transfer equation is deformed to the same shape as the static radiative transfer equation ( eq .  [ eq : shdom ] ) with modified absorption and emission coefficients as @xmath22 where @xmath23 since @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given , the equation ( [ eq : time ] ) can be implicitly solved with the original shdom code .",
    "such an implementation of time dependence has been successfully adopted in previous studies @xcite .",
    "we note that the 4th order runge - kutta scheme is adopted to proceed the time step ( appendix  [ appendix ] ) .",
    "variables at the next time step are evaluated in the laboratory frame with discrete ordinates with the ray tracing method .",
    "the variables are first lorentz transformed with discrete ordinates to the comoving frame before the conversion from the discrete ordinates to the spherical harmonics .",
    "then , the source terms are evaluated in the comoving frame with spherical harmonics .",
    "the source terms are first converted from spherical harmonics to discrete ordinates and then lorentz transformed from the comoving frame to the laboratory frame .",
    "the obtained source term is adopted for the ray tracing in the laboratory frame .",
    "the lorentz transformation from the laboratory frame to the comoving frame moving with @xmath26 , corresponding to the lorentz factor of @xmath27 , is defined with the following equations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath28\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : lorentzray}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where physical values in the comoving frame are denoted with a subscript @xmath29 .",
    "the lorentz transformation is required for an intensity @xmath30 , an emission coefficient @xmath31 , and an extinction coefficient @xmath32 , whose lorentz invariants are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , respectively . the frequency and traveling direction of radiation are transformed with equations ( [ eq : lorentzfreq ] ) and ( [ eq : lorentzray ] ) .",
    "we prepare @xmath36 mesh points in the laboratory and comoving frames and the lorentz invariants along the rays , which are transformed from a frame and remapped to the rays in the other frame , and then the intensity , emission coefficient , and absorption coefficient are obtained in the other frame .",
    "the source function due to scattering is evaluated with spherical harmonics as the original shdom code does .",
    "since the prescription is expatiated in @xcite , we briefly describe the procedure .",
    "the source function @xmath37 is expanded in spherical harmonics space as @xmath38 where @xmath39 are orthonormal real - valued spherical harmonics functions , whereas the phase function of the scattering @xmath40 is expanded in a legendre series in the scattering angle as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the maximum order of legendre polynomials , and legendre polynomials , respectively .",
    "the source function is computed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the single scattering albedo , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are intensity and thermal emission expanded in spherical harmonics , respectively .",
    "we adopt the phase functions of thomson and compton scattering .",

    "the equations are @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the photon frequency after the scattering and @xmath53 is the rest mass of electron @xcite .",
    "a change of the photon frequency and dependence of the scattering kernel on the photon frequency are essential features of the compton scattering .",
    "therefore , we implement a multi - group treatment for test calculations of the compton scattering .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath54 of an incident photon in @xmath55-th frequency bin with a range of @xmath56 $ ] to @xmath57-th frequency bin with a range of @xmath58 $ ] is a frequency - dependent scattering kernel defined by equation ( [ eq : comptoncross ] ) .",

    "the shdom code evaluates a source function in spherical harmonics and solves a static radiative transfer equation with a ray tracing in discrete ordinates .",
    "the rrt code is validated by the various tests and the comparison with the rmc calculations .",
    "the searchlight beam , two beam with shadow , radiative pulse , and relativistic beaming tests are successfully passed by the rrt code and confirm that the rrt code correctly handles the time dependence and the lorentz transformation .",
    "the results of the rrt code are consistent with those of the rmc code and the comparisons verify the implementation of elastic thomson and inelastic compton scattering and multi - group treatment in the rrt code .",
    "the rmc code , in turn , is validated against the egs tools ( appendix  [ appendix2 ] ) .",
    "the rrt code enables us to obtain the evolution of intensity and thus to self - consistently derive an eddington tensors without approximations like the flux limited diffusion or the m1 closure methods .",
    "we emphasize that the radiation tends to be more anisotropic in the relativistic fluid because of the lorentz transformation and compton scattering for the @xmath1-ray photons , and thus that the angular distribution of radiation should be properly taken into account .",
    "combining the eddington tensors with relativistic hydrodynamics calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a relativistic radiation hydrodynamics will be realized with the variable eddington tensor method .",
    "furthermore , the rrt code implicitly solves the radiative transfer equation and thus can follow the radiative transfer in a non - relativistic fluid like a supernova without adopting unnecessarily short time steps .",
    "such a method will be useful to clarify the connection between grbs and supernovae .",
    "it is currently difficult to increase the numbers of frequency bins , and angular and spatial mesh points due to an available memory resource .",
    "the difficulties are solved if the adaptive treatment of mesh points and the parallelization with distributed memory are implemented because the ray tracing in the laboratory frame and the evaluation of source function in the comoving frame are independent of each ray and each mesh point , respectively .",
    "however , we note the low resolution of the frequency is an intrinsic drawback of the multi - group treatment compared to the monte carlo method , in which a frequency of each photon changes continuously .",
    "thus , the monte carlo method is superior to the rrt code for spectral synthesis calculations of lines and fine spectral features .",
    "however , the method intrinsically involves a noise and it is expensive to reduce the noise because the reduction is realized only proportional to the square root of the number of photon packets . and",
    ", the large number of photon packets is necessary to follow the time dependence because the photon packets are emitted at each time step .",
    "furthermore , the radiation contributes to the hydrodynamics with an integration of radiation over all frequency and the dynamical effects of the radiation in grbs are not dominated by narrow spectral lines .",
    "thus , we propose a post - processing monte carlo calculation for spectral synthesis after a time - dependent matter - coupled relativistic radiative transfer calculation .",

    "we treat the time dependence with the modified absorption and emission coefficients as shown in section  [ sec : time ] , and implicitly obtain the self - consistent time - dependent intensity at @xmath160 .",
    "although the time derivative is differentiated in the first order , we adopt the 4th order runge - kutta scheme to proceed the time step from @xmath161 to @xmath160 by dividing the time interval to 4 steps , in order to increase the accuracy by adopting smaller time intervals .",

    "the fluence is defined as a summation of @xmath175 for all photons per unit area at each boundary of slabs , where @xmath15 is the angle the photon makes with respect to the normal to the plane .",
