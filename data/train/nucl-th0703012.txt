    "pion production in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) collisions is subject of theoretical and experimental investigations already since the 1960s  for a review of the history of the field see ref .",
    "however , when new high precision data became available due to advanced accelerator technology in the beginning of the 1990s it became clear that all phenomenological studies performed so far were not capable of describing the data .",
    "several mechanisms were proposed to cure the problem ; however , no clear picture emerged  @xcite .",
    "there was the hope that chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) could resolve the issue .",
    "as the effective field theory for the standard model at low energies it should provide a framework to investigate the reactions @xmath0 in a field - theoretically consistent way . in a first attempt a scheme proposed by weinberg to study elastic and inelastic pion reactions on nuclei  @xcite was applied to investigate also pion production in @xmath1 collisions . however , in doing so up to next  to  leading order ( nlo ) the discrepancy between the calculations and data became even worse  @xcite .",
    "in addition , loop contributions , formally of order nnlo , gave even larger effects  @xcite shedding doubts on an applicability of chiral perturbation theory to @xmath0 .",
    "in parallel , already in refs .  @xcite it was stressed that the large momentum transfer , typical for meson production in @xmath1 collisions , needs to be taken care of in the power counting .",
    "this idea was further developed in refs .",
    "the appropriate expansion parameter for @xmath0 therefore is @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the threshold momentum for pion production in @xmath1 collisions . @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the masses of the nucleon and pion , respectively . here",
    "the leading - order ( lo ) scales as @xmath6 and subleading orders n@xmath7lo scale as @xmath8 . for the most recent developments for the reaction @xmath0 within chiral perturbation theory we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus in the reactions @xmath0 one is faced with a two - scale expansion , since both @xmath5 as well as @xmath9 appear explicitly in the expressions . for tree - level diagrams",
    "this does not cause any problem . to perform the power counting for loop integrals , however , a rule has to be given what scale to assign to the components of the loop momentum .",
    "after subtraction of the nucleon mass @xmath4 , the residual energy of each external nucleon at threshold is @xmath10 , whereas the corresponding momentum is of order @xmath9 .",
    "one therefore would be tempted to take over this scaling also for the loop momentum . on the other hand",
    "the new power counting is based on two scales , @xmath11 , and the pions in loops are off - shell . therefore there is no reason why the scaling of the pion energies in loops should be different from the scaling of the pertinent three - momenta . in appendix",
    "e of ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that for all diagrams that do not have a two - nucleon cut , each component of the loop momentum should be counted of order of the largest external momentum in the loop .",
    "the argument there is based on the observation that in time ordered perturbation theory ( topt ) there is no ambiguity for the order assignment of energies since it is a 3 dimensional theory in the first place . on the other hand",
    "the leading order of a given topt amplitude should agree to that of the corresponding feynman amplitude .",
    "this allows to identify the proper scale for the energy of the loop momentum .",
    "the assignment was checked by explicit calculations in refs .  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "all components of the loop momentum in diagram ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .  [ loops ]",
    "scale as @xmath12 , but those of diagram ( c ) and ( d ) scale as @xmath13 and are therefore suppressed can be removed from the integral by , e.g. , a proper choice of the integration variable in full analogy to the discussion given below eq .",
    "( [ firststep ] ) . ] .",
    "one further consequence of the presence of two scales in the problem is that the individual loops no longer contribute to only a single order , but each loop contributes to infinitely many orders , since @xmath14 appears as the argument of non  analytic functions .",
    "the power counting only identifies the lowest order where the particular loop starts to contribute  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the sum of all diagrams of fig .",
    "[ loops ] is independent of the choice of the pion field .",
    "however , based on the scheme developed in refs .",
    "@xcite only diagram @xmath15 and @xmath16 contribute at nlo whereas diagrams @xmath17 and @xmath18 start to contribute not until order n@xmath19lo ( see table 11 of ref .",
    "the main purpose of this letter is to investigate the consistency of these two statements .",

    "the loop momenta are at least of the order of the pion mass .",
    "thus the components of @xmath180 either scale as @xmath9 , as used in the previous paragraph , or as @xmath5  as in the integral of eqs .",
    "( [ intermediate ] ) and ( [ nloadep ] ) or in fig .  [ loops ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "let us stress that also in the latter case the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ sexpand ] ) holds , since the other terms of order @xmath5 , namely @xmath67 and @xmath181 , canceled and the remaining recoil terms are suppressed by at least one power of @xmath109 .",
    "it is also instructive to derive the @xmath21 expansion of the propagator directly from the covariant expression of eq .",
    "( [ covprop ] ) . using again the on - shell condition for the incoming nucleon , @xmath182 , we may write @xmath183  note that @xmath184 . we are interested in the case @xmath185 , where @xmath9 was defined below eq .",
    "( [ chiprod ] ) . therefore @xmath186 corresponds to @xmath187 .",
    "we thus identify @xmath188 as the leading term for the propagator in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ nprop1 ] ) .",
    "all other terms that still appear in the denominator are corrections .",
    "after a taylor expansion to next  to  leading order we get @xmath189 as indicated , this expression contains the leading and next  to  leading piece of the propagator and , in addition , a piece that can give momentum dependence to the vertices ( this contribution can be mapped onto the effect of the spinors in the previous derivation ) , and , finally , a contact term that is the leading term for the effects of the anti  nucleon in the intermediate state .        b.  y.  park , f.  myhrer , j.  r.  morones , t.  meissner and k.  kubodera , phys .  rev .",
