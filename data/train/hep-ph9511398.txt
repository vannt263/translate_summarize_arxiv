    "azimuthal correlations in photon - photon collisions have been studied , in the past , in a number of papers where , in particular , the single - tag configuration was considered @xcite .",
    "one paper was also devoted to the study of those correlations in a double - tag configuration with both electrons being tagged at small angle @xcite .",
    "let us mention , in addition , a paper@xcite where the authors investigated azimuthal correlations in pair production in a no - tag configuration , using the acoplanarity of the produced particles in the lab frame .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show how the potential of azimuthal correlations , as they can be derived from the general helicity formula for @xmath0 collisions in the case of 2-body or quasi 2-body reactions , can be exploited , in various experimental configurations , in order to extract a maximum of physical information from measurements of those reactions . for each of those configurations ,",
    "we define the corresponding experimental constraints to be applied .    in section ii",
    "we write down the general helicity formula as a sum of 13 terms involving each a different dependence on azimuthal angles . in section",
    "iii we apply that formula to four particular experimental configurations where the analysis of azimuthal correlations should allow one to determine a number of structure functions @xmath1 .",
    "our treatment of the first two is rather trivial ; that of the third and fourth one is more sophisticated , since it involves the use of `` azimuthal selection '' , as we shall define it .",
    "since the fourth configuration appears to be the most promising one and has not been considered elsewhere , we compute , in section iv , a number of corresponding applications to particular processes and dynamic models .",
    "section v contains a brief discussion and conclusion .",
    "kinematic constraints to be applied in configurations 2 and 4 are being computed in an appendix .",
    "the general helicity formula for two - body or quasi two - body reactions induced by the photon - photon interaction , i.e. for processes of the type @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 may be a system of particles instead of a single one ) , as shown by fig . 1 , has been in the literature for a long time @xcite . while at the start this formula contains @xmath4 terms , since the helicity matrix of either photon is composed of @xmath5 elements , that number is considerably reduced by applying first principles , namely hermiticity , parity conservation and rotational invariance .",
    "gathering together terms which have the same behaviour with respect to azimuthal angles , we get a 13-term formula : @xmath6 with : @xmath7    here the quantities @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) are linear combinations of elements of the helicity tensor associated with the process @xmath9 ; these quantities , which are typical structure functions ( @xmath10 is the diagonal structure function , while all others may be called `` interference structure functions '' ) , are given as follows : @xmath11 where the tensor elements @xmath12 are defined as @xmath13 calling @xmath14 resp .",
    "@xmath15 the helicities of @xmath16 resp . @xmath17",
    "; the symbol @xmath18 indicates summation over the spin states of @xmath19 and @xmath3 .",
    "the elements @xmath20 depend on @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the respective four - momenta of @xmath16 and @xmath26 ) , and calling @xmath22 the polar angle of @xmath19 with respect to @xmath16 in the @xmath27 center - of - mass frame .",
    "let us remark that hermiticity entails the relation @xmath28 , while parity conservation and rotational invariance entail @xmath29 .",
    "in addition we use the following notations : @xmath30 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath31 with respect to @xmath32 in the @xmath27 c. m. frame with the @xmath33 axis oriented along the three - momentum of the photon @xmath16 ; @xmath34 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath19 with respect to @xmath32 in the same frame .",
    "the polarization parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 of , respectively , the photons @xmath16 and @xmath17 are given as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the total energy squared in the overall center - of - mass frame , while @xmath39 and @xmath40 are defined as : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , calling @xmath43 the respective four - momenta of @xmath44 .",
    "notice that in ( 5 ) we have neglected the electron mass ; actually one has @xmath35",
    "( @xmath45 when @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) reaches its minimal value .",
    "the lorentz - invariant phase space is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of final particles , and @xmath50 are the respective four - momenta of initial and final particles , while the superscript @xmath51 indicates the energy component .",
    "( if @xmath52 is a system of particles , an integration over all corresponding 3-momenta , except one , is implicitly included . )",
    "finally @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath56 with respect to @xmath57 in the lab frame with the @xmath33 axis oriented along the three - momentum of the incident electron @xmath58 .",
    "we here assume a measurement where both outgoing electrons are tagged , and a so - called `` unfolding '' procedure is used in order to extrapolate the acceptance of the central detector to @xmath60 .",
    "this allows one to integrate formula ( 2 ) over @xmath61 between @xmath51 and @xmath62 , so that one obtains the three - term formula ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath63    actually formula ( 8) can hardly be exploited in that form for an azimuthal - correlation study , for the following reason : since @xmath64 involves longitudinal ( helicity 0 ) components of both photons , it can be shown by general arguments ( see section iii of ref .  @xcite ) to stay non - negligible only when both outgoing electrons are tagged at large angles ( i.e. @xmath65 )  @xcite .",
    "but in that case @xmath66 depends on @xmath30 ( as can be inferred from formula ( 7 ) , since @xmath55 is correlated with @xmath30 ) , and therefore the functions @xmath1 , as well as their coefficients , also depend on @xmath30 .",
    "it is then obvious that it would become much more complicated to extract the structure functions from the analysis of the @xmath30 distribution ( all the more as the integrated cross sections are expected to be very small in that kinematic situation ) .",
    "one is thus led to consider the case where at least one of the outgoing electrons ( for instance @xmath56 ) is tagged at small angle ( i.e. @xmath67 ) .",
    "we now use formula ( 7 ) and in addition the relation @xmath68 that relation shows that - except for a small range near @xmath69 , and for marginal ranges of @xmath39 and @xmath40 that one can suppress by setting upper limits on those variables - one is allowed to identify @xmath30 with @xmath55 . we thus get : @xmath70    still one may consider two different experimental situations : ( a ) both electrons are tagged at small angle @xmath71 ; ( b ) @xmath56 is tagged at small angle , @xmath72 at large angle ( @xmath73 ) . in both cases",
    "@xmath66 tends to become independent of @xmath30 , i.e. : @xmath74 while at the same time the condition for neglect of longitudinal contributions ( ref .",
    "@xcite , formula ( 3.5 ) ) , i.e. @xmath75 , is satisfied , so that @xmath64 goes to zero .",
    "one is then left with the two - term formula @xmath76 where in case ( a ) one has @xmath77 with the helicity - tensor elements depending only on @xmath78 and @xmath22 , while in case ( b ) one gets @xmath79 with the helicity - tensor elements depending on @xmath78 , @xmath46 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath10 , being composed only of diagonal elements of the helicity - tensor , is to be identified , apart from kinematic factors , with the differential cross section @xmath80 in case ( a ) , resp .",
    "@xmath81 in case ( b ) , for the reaction @xmath82 ; for instance , in the case where ( @xmath83 ) is a pair of charged particles , one gets @xmath84 where @xmath85 is defined as : @xmath86 . that cross section",
    "can obviously be determined as well in the no - tag resp . the single - tag mode .",
    "double tagging , with the constraints defined in order to allow for an azimuthal - correlation analysis , provides the possibility of extracting an additional structure function ( @xmath87 ) ; the price to pay is , of course , a lowering of the yield obtained .",
    "notice that , at @xmath88 , formula ( 5 ) becomes considerably simplified , as one gets @xmath89 finally let us remark that , since @xmath90 , as shown by formula ( 9 ) , and since one may assume the electron - tagging systems to be cylindrically symmetric , there should be no distorsion , due to the apparatus , of the @xmath30 distribution .      in that configuration the untagged ( or antitagged ) electron , e.g. @xmath31 ,",
    "is predominantly emitted very close to @xmath91 , so that @xmath92 becomes essentially negligible as compared with @xmath93 , which has the obvious consequences that : ( i ) @xmath66 becomes independent of @xmath30 ( see again formula ( 10 ) ) ; ( ii ) @xmath90 ( formula ( 9 ) ) and therefore , assuming here again the electron tagging system to be cylindrically symmetric , there should be no distorsion of the @xmath30 distribution due to the apparatus .",
    "we may thus integrate formula ( 2 ) over @xmath30 between @xmath51 and @xmath62 , so that we obtain the three - term formula : @xmath94 with @xmath95 again @xmath96 are given by formula ( 16 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite formula ( 18 ) has been applied to muon and pion pair production , using two different models for the latter . however , in that paper , the problem of experimental constraints to be applied in order to suppress the distorsion of the @xmath61 distribution , induced by the limited acceptance of the central detector , was left aside .",
    "actually one should here assume that the latter has an `` almost @xmath97 '' acceptance .",
    "yet a kinematic study shows that , even if the acceptance cuts of the central detector remain very small , the cuts induced by them in the polar emission angle of the particles produced in the @xmath27 c. m. frame may be large , not confined to the margins of phase space , and azimuth - dependent ( as was already noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore additional constraints should be imposed in order to minimize the latter cuts .",
    "this problem , which appears as well in configuration 4 , is treated in the appendix of this paper .",
    "notice that in the single - tag case @xmath66 can only be determined by measuring all particles produced . when this is not possible ( in the case of multi - particle final - states ) , the fact that @xmath98 is an additional source of complications .",
    "let us mention that a measurement of this type , involving muon pair production , has recently been performed by the l3 collaboration at lep ( cern ) @xcite .",
    "we here assume that the electron - tagging angles are small enough to ensure that + @xmath99 , so that in formula ( 2 ) we may neglect all longitudinal helicity - tensor elements , i.e. those with at least one 0 subscript .",
    "we are thus left with the five - term formula ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( 5.33 ) ) :    @xmath100    with @xmath101 where the helicity - tensor elements depend on @xmath78 and @xmath22 ; @xmath102 , @xmath103 are again given by formula ( 16 ) .",
    "at this point we note that , if the whole range @xmath104 , @xmath105 is available , one may use the orthogonality of the functions \\{@xmath106 } in that range and thus extract @xmath107 by projecting formula ( 19 ) on those functions .",
    "however it seems preferable , in order to get more information , to apply what we call `` azimuthal selection '' , i.e. to select individual distributions with respect to the azimuthal angles involved , as follows : let us assume , for instance , that we are interested in the distribution with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath108 .",
    "switching from our system of azimuthal variables @xmath109 to the system @xmath110 , we write : @xmath111    integrating over @xmath30 between @xmath51 and @xmath62 , we then get : @xmath112    similarly we can select three other azimuthal - angle distributions : @xmath113    here we have again made use of the fact that the @xmath30-dependence of @xmath66 can be neglected according to formula ( 10 ) .",
    "in addition we have implicitly assumed that there is no distorsion of the @xmath114 distribution due to the apparatus ( i.e. @xmath30 varies between @xmath51 and @xmath115 whatever the values of the other variables within the phase space considered ) ; that assumption is justified , here again , by the fact that @xmath116 ( formula ( 9 ) ) , and that we may suppose both electrons to be tagged in a cylindrically symmetric way .",
    "finally we have implicitly assumed that there is no distorsion of the @xmath61 distribution .",
    "this assumption , as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , requires a somewhat more stringent condition to be imposed on @xmath117 and @xmath118 , namely : @xmath119 ; that means that the transverse momenta of both photons in the lab frame can be neglected with respect to the transverse momentum of @xmath120 in the @xmath27 c. m. frame . under that condition",
    "the @xmath121 collision axis tends to be identical with the colliding - beam axis ; consequently one gets @xmath122 , and it thus becomes sufficient to assume that the central detector is , as well , cylindrically symmetric .",
    "the condition here defined implies of course that an appropriate lower limit is assigned to @xmath123 .",
    "as one sees from formulas ( 21)-(24 ) , azimuthal selection should allow one , in the configu- ration considered , to extract four azimuthal - angle distributions , and correspondingly five structure functions , from the data obtained in a single measurement .",
    "it must however be remarked that because of left - right symmetry the @xmath61 and @xmath124 distributions , and correspondingly the structure functions @xmath125 and @xmath126 , should be identical .",
    "thus , we get in fact three independent azimuthal correlations , allowing for the determination of four independent structure functions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite formulas ( 22)-(25 ) have been applied to lepton and pion pair production .",
    "it is to be mentioned that an experiment of that type is presently being prepared at the low - energy electron - positron collider da@xmath127ne at frascati @xcite .      as in case ( b ) of configuration 1 , we here assume that the electron @xmath32 is tagged at large angle ( @xmath128 ) , while @xmath31 is assumed to be tagged at small angle ( @xmath129 ) . thus @xmath66 becomes practically indendent of @xmath114 , according to formula ( 10 ) , while at the same time all helicity - tensor elements with at least one @xmath51 helicity subscript for the right - hand photon tend to vanish .",
    "formula ( 2 ) is then reduced to an eight - term formula : @xmath130 with @xmath131    where the helicity - tensor elements depend on @xmath132 and @xmath22 ; @xmath133 are again given by formula ( 16 ) .",
    "azimuthal selection , applied in the same way as in iii.c , makes it possible to derive from formula ( 26 ) six independent azimuthal correlations , from which eight independent structure functions can be extracted .",
    "those correlations are the following : @xmath134    here again we have assumed that there is no distorsion of the @xmath30-distribution due to the apparatus , since @xmath90 ( formula ( 9 ) ) and we may consider that both electrons are tagged in a cylindrically symmetric way .    on the other hand ( as in configuration 2 ) , given the limited acceptance of the central detector , ensuring the absence of distorsion of the @xmath61 distribution is a critical problem that will be treated in the appendix .",
    "we shall now consider practical applications of the 8-term formula ( 26 ) computed in iii.d .",
    "the processes considered are , here again , @xmath135 production of muon and pion pairs . in that case one gets from formula ( 6 ) , assuming @xmath136 : @xmath137    equating @xmath55 with @xmath114 ( see ( 9 ) ) , and taking account of ( 10 ) ( with @xmath138 ) , this expression transforms into : @xmath139    returning to formula ( 1 ) , and using ( 16 ) and again ( 10 ) , we obtain @xmath140    for our computations we have fixed a number of limits on the various integration parameters chosen .",
    "those limits are the following :    * @xmath141 ( corresponding approximately to a minimal tagging angle of @xmath142 mrad for @xmath56 ) , and @xmath143 ( in order to justify the neglect of @xmath30-dependence of @xmath66 in formula ( 10 ) , and at the same time to motivate the neglect of longitudinal polarization of the photon @xmath17 ) . * @xmath144 ( again because of formula ( 10 ) ) , and @xmath145 ( in order to ensure a significant contribution of the longitudinal polarization of @xmath16 ) . * @xmath146 ( see appendix ) .",
    "* once again because of formula ( 10 ) , we set : @xmath147 ; @xmath148 , or equivalently + @xmath149 .",
    "* @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( see appendix ) ; these limits , combined with those defined in ( iv ) , also induce further limitations of @xmath117 and @xmath66 . * finally , because of the particular sensitivity of polar - angle ranges close to @xmath51 resp .",
    "@xmath59 with regard to possible cuts located there , we set : @xmath152 .    using formula ( 36 ) and replacing @xmath153 , resp .",
    "@xmath154 , by their expressions given in formulas ( 28)-(33 ) , and then integrating over the variables @xmath155 and @xmath66 , we have obtained , for each particular process and model considered , the six angular distributions @xmath156 , where @xmath127 is to be identified respectively with @xmath157 . in figures",
    "2 - 5 we are showing , for @xmath127 ranging between @xmath158 and @xmath59 ( notice that , in the @xmath159 range between @xmath59 and @xmath62 , symmetric values are obtained ) , the normalized distributions @xmath160 , defined in such a way that @xmath161 .",
    "let us remark that , since the structure functions @xmath162 and @xmath163 are changing sign with @xmath164 , the distributions in @xmath165 have been computed by integrating only over half of the @xmath164 range , i.e. @xmath166 .    fig .",
    "2 shows the azimuthal correlations obtained for muon pair production , assuming a beam energy of @xmath167   gev .",
    "we have checked that the shapes of those curves remain practically unchanged when one goes over to a much higher beam energy ( @xmath168 gev ) .",
    "3 and 4 show , again for @xmath169 gev , the corresponding correlations obtained for @xmath170 production , as computed respectively in two different models : the perturbative - qcd model proposed by brodsky and lepage @xcite , as extended by gunion et al .",
    "@xcite for @xmath171 collisions , with the pion wave function given by chernyak and zhitnitsky @xcite ; and the finite - size model of poppe @xcite , where the amplitude of the born - term calculation is multiplied by an overall form factor .",
    "notice that here the lower limit introduced for @xmath66 is @xmath172 gev .",
    "5 shows the analogous curves obtained for @xmath173 production at the same beam energy , using again the brodsky - lepage model with the chernyak - zhitnitsky wave function .",
    "the values of integrated cross sections ( obtained by replacing @xmath174 by @xmath10 in ( 36 ) ) are given in table 1 , where they are compared with those of the `` theoretical background '' ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. of the contribution of the feynman diagram shown in fig . 6 , computed within the same kinematic limits . for @xmath175 production , we here use a simple vdm model involving only @xmath176-exchange .",
    "it is seen that this background remains insignificant as compared to the signal ( in the case of @xmath177 production , it is of course strictly zero ) . as regards the interference term between the diagrams of figs . 1 and 6 , it is reduced to zero if , instead of identifying particle @xmath120 with the muon ( resp .",
    "pion ) of either positive or negative charge , we average over those two options .",
    "notice that in the figures of table 1 we have included a factor of 2 in order to account for the possibility of performing a symmetric measurement ( @xmath32 tagged at large angle , @xmath56 at small angle ; and conversely ) .",
    "finally it is to be emphasized that , if one uses a monte - carlo program taking account of all experimental acceptances , one would certainly be allowed to suppress some of the severe kinematic restrictions here introduced .",
    "azimuthal correlations are , to a large extent , a new approach to the study of photon - photon collisions .",
    "till now practically all experimental efforts in two - photon physics have been concentrated on measuring @xmath178 cross sections or the `` photon structure function '' @xmath179 ( i.e. the @xmath180 total hadronic cross section ) , which correspond to the diagonal structure function @xmath10 in the formalism presented here .",
    "azimuthal correlations should allow one to determine , depending on the configuration considered , one , two , three or seven additional independent structure functions .",
    "it should be emphasized that in principle @xmath10 does not contain a larger amount of physical information than the others .",
    "its special status arises only from the fact that it is more easily determined ; in addition , due to the schwarz inequality , it is larger than ( or at least equal to ) any of the interference structure functions . in that sense",
    "it appears as the _ primus inter pares _ , but not more . in other words : azimuthal correlations should allow one to multiply the physical information , obtained in a number of two - photon processes , by a factor of 2 , 3 , 4 or 8 .    as can be seen for instance by comparing figs . 3 and 4 , two different dynamic models for a given process can lead to very different shapes of the azimuthal - correlation curves , implying that the values of the structure functions involved are very different as well .",
    "thus azimuthal correlations should provide one with a powerful tool for checking dynamic models .",
    "actually we may safely state that no model will survive this kind of check if it is not entirely realistic .",
    "there is however a price to pay for this achievement : there are more or less stringent experimental constraints that should be satisfied . in configurations 1 and 3 ,",
    "what is required is the possibility of tagging the outgoing electrons ( and of measuring their azimuthal angles ) at small scattering angles . in configuration 2 , an `` almost @xmath60 ''",
    "central detector appears necessary . in configuration 4",
    "both requirements are combined , and in addition , since the measured cross section is sharply reduced by significant cuts in most of the parameters to be measured , a very high machine luminosity is required .    however , as already noticed above , the use of a monte - carlo program should allow one to relax to some extent the constraints here defined and thus to increase the integrated cross section .    in any case , and whatever the particular @xmath178 process and the configuration considered , azimuthal - correlation measurements in muon pair production under the same conditions should always be used as a test , so as to check the validity of the approximations applied .",
    "notice that in general it would be more problematic to use electron pairs for that purpose , given the complications due to exchange between scattered and produced electrons .",
    "let us finally remark that , for checking perturbative qcd , it appears particularly interesting to look for azimuthal correlations in the two - photon production of quark pairs ( notice that , in the quark - parton model , the azimuthal - correlation curves predicted for the production of light - quark pairs are the same as for @xmath181 production ) .",
    "measuring azimuthal angles of jets is probably a difficult , but not impossible , task for experimentalists .",
    "another option would be to investigate azimuthal correlations in the inclusive production of one hadron ( plus anything ) .",
    "the authors are grateful to dr .",
    "a.  courau for illuminating discussions and precious advice .",
    "one of us ( o.  p. ) would like to thank the theory group of the `` laboratoire de physique corpusculaire , collge de france '' for the warm hospitality extended to him .",
    "our problem is how to minimize azimuth - dependent cuts in @xmath182 , induced by the limited acceptance of the central detector . for simplicity",
    ", we shall stick to the case of production of particle - antiparticle pairs ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "then we can use formulas ( a10 ) - ( a12 ) of the appendix of ref .",
    "we shall however rewrite those formulas , using slightly different notations ( and in addition , as regards formula ( a12 ) , exchanging the variables pertaining to the left- and right - hand vertex of fig .",
    "we thus get      with @xmath185 , the lab energy of particle @xmath120 , given by @xmath186^{1/2}}{2(e_x^2 -\\tilde{p}_x^2)}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath187\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where in addition we have used the following definitions : @xmath188 are the lab scattering angles of @xmath189 , while @xmath190 is the lab polar emission angle of particle @xmath120 with respect to @xmath32 ; @xmath191 ; @xmath192 .",
    "notice that in formula ( a2 ) only solution + is valid when @xmath193 .",
    "it is to be remarked that @xmath182 is implicitly depending on @xmath194 through its explicit dependence on @xmath55 and @xmath195 ( see formulas ( a9 ) , ( a13 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , showing the relations between azimuthal angles in the lab and the c. m. frame ) .",
    "on the other hand we assume @xmath199 , which entails ( according to ( a3 ) , setting @xmath200 ) that @xmath201 .",
    "therefore only solution + is to be considered in ( a2 ) ; in addition it becomes possible to make a convergent series expansion , in @xmath202 , of the radical in ( a2 ) .",
    "that formula thus becomes @xmath203 where we shall retain only the first term on the right - hand side . substituting that expression of @xmath185 into ( a5 )",

    "<S> using the general helicity formula for @xmath0 collisions , we are showing that it should be possible to determine a number of independent `` structure functions '' , i.e. linear combinations of elements of the two - photon helicity tensor , through azimuthal correlations in two - body or quasi two - body reactions induced by the photon - photon interaction , provided certain experimental conditions are satisfied . </S>",
