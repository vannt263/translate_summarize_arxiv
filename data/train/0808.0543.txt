    "magnetic cataclysmic variables ( mcvs ) , consisting of the classes known as polars and intermediate polars , are composed of a roche - lobe - filling m type main sequence star in orbit about a magnetic white dwarf ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "mass is lost through the inner lagrangian point , @xmath3 , and flows toward the magnetosphere of the white dwarf either predominately in a stream ( polars ) or after forming a truncated accretion disk circulating around the white dwarf ( intermediate polars ) . in either case , the ionized gas follows magnetic field lines to the surface of the white dwarf after the gas reaches the magnetosphere where the magnetic pressure exceeds the gas ram pressure . upon reaching the white dwarf surface",
    "the gas will be essentially at `` free fall '' , with highly supersonic velocities .",
    "the abrupt stop of the radial inflow near the surface of the white dwarf leads to the formation of a shock , which heats the inflowing material @xcite .",
    "the hot subsonic post - shock flow settles gradually onto the white dwarf , and cools via emitting bremsstrahlung x - rays and optical / infra - red cyclotron radiation .",
    "the hydrodynamic structure of the post - shock settling flow is determined by radiative and particle energy processes , which are essentially characterized by the bremsstrahlung cooling time @xmath4 , the cyclotron cooling time @xmath5 , the electron - ion energy - exchange time @xmath6 , the electron - electron collisional time @xmath7 , and the ion - ion collisional time @xmath8 @xcite . for weakly magnetic systems ( with @xmath9 g or weaker ) with accretion luminosities @xmath10 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 , typical of mcvs , @xmath11 . as the strength of the magnetic field increases to @xmath12  g",
    ", cyclotron cooling may dominate bremsstrahlung cooling , @xmath13 . for sufficiently strong magnetic fields and low specific accretion rates , @xmath5 is so short ( @xmath14 ) that collisions between electrons and ions can not maintain an equal temperature between the two types of particles .",
    "the accretion flow is therefore in a two - fluid regime which requires a two - temperature ( 2 t ) hydrodynamic description .",
    "a strong magnetic field can also result in a situation where cyclotron radiative loss is so rapid ( @xmath15 ) that electron - electron collisions are not efficient enough to maintain a maxwellian distribution . in the extreme situation where @xmath16 , the accretion flow is no longer hydrodynamic .",
    "previous calculations of cyclotron radiation from the post - shock settling flow in mcvs have either assumed a uniform density and temperature ( @xcite ; @xcite ; + @xcite ; + @xcite ; + @xcite ) or a one - temperature ( 1 t ) structure ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , detailed 1d calculations of the hydrodynamic structure of a post - shock accretion column that self - consistently include cyclotron and bremsstrahlung cooling clearly show that a 2 t structure is to be expected in many physical situations relevant to mcvs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    here",
    "we have computed and compared the cyclotron radiation from a cylindrical post - shock accretion column , with a uniform cylindrical radial structure , assuming both a 1 t hydrodynamic structure and a 2 t hydrodynamic structure .",
    "the resulting cyclotron spectra for a grid of three white dwarf masses ( 0.5 , 0.7 and 1.0 @xmath17 ) , three magnetic field strengths ( 10 , 30 and 50 mg ) and two mass flow rates ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 g s@xmath2 ) were computed for various viewing inclination angles . for each case , using the computed viewing - angle dependent cyclotron spectra , johnson bandpass @xcite filtered light curves over an orbital period were computed for a mcv with an orbital inclination of 45@xmath20 and with the given accretion column at a co - latitude of 30@xmath20 .",

    "with this constraint on the specific mass accretion rate , 1 t and 2 t hydrodynamic accretion column structures were computed as described in  [ hydro ] . the computed electron temperature and density in the column , as a function of height , was then determined for the center of each cube , of individual side length @xmath37 , in a computational grid - of - cubes .",

    "one - temperature flow is similarly given by @xmath39 @xmath58 @xmath59    the flow is assumed to have a constant density , pressure and temperature across the column area @xmath26 .",
    "note that variation of structure across the column can substantially affect the radiation produced @xcite but here we assume the simpler structure so that the effects of the 1 t and 2 t structures , alone , in the production of radiation may be discerned . in the formulation given by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the pressure ratio of the electrons to ions at the shock , @xmath60 was taken to be a free parameter . here we take @xmath61 , which corresponds to an assumption of solar metallicity .",

    "more accurate stokes imaging models may need to incorporate , somehow , the fact that the flow will be 2 t , especially at the rim of an accretion spot , where the specific accretion rates may be low @xcite .    on the positive side , for stokes imaging , is that the differences in emission predicted from 1 t and 2 t columns is insignificant in all cases for lower cyclotron harmonics in the infra - red and optical .",

    "only linear polarization differences are apparent .",
    "linear polarization light curves were more sensitive to assumptions made about the accretion flow than circular polarization light curves .",
    "this distinction between predicted linear and circularly polarized emission is consistent with past modeling of observational data , which either explicitly or implicitly assume one - temperature hydrodynamics , where the fits to linear polarization data are generally poorer than fits to the circular polarization data ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "assuming a one - temperature hydrodynamic post - shock accretion column as the source for polarized radiation in models of magnetic cataclysmic variables can lead to erroneous predictions for the radiation when the cyclotron cooling efficiency is greater than the electron - ion energy exchange efficiency .",
    "this effect shows up at the lower mass flow rate modeled here ( @xmath128 g @xmath1s@xmath2 ) at higher cyclotron harmonics for the fairly generic white dwarf masses of 0.7 and 1.0 @xmath17 and magnetic fields of 30 mg or greater .",
    "so the interpretation of light curve data obtained at higher frequencies , in the ultraviolet , needs to take into account the effect of two - temperature flow on the production of polarized radiation .",
    "in particular , the number of linear polarization pulses observed in the ultraviolet can be misinterpreted if a one - temperature accretion column flow is assumed .",

    "<S> the temperatures of electrons and ions in the post - shock accretion region of a magnetic cataclysmic variable ( mcv ) will be equal at sufficiently high mass flow rates or for sufficiently weak magnetic fields . at lower mass flow rates or in stronger magnetic fields , efficient cyclotron cooling will cool the electrons faster than the electrons can cool the ions and a two - temperature flow will result . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the differences in polarized radiation expected from mcv post - shock accretion columns modeled with one- and two - temperature hydrodynamics . in an mcv model with one accretion region , a magnetic field 30 mg and a specific mass flow rate of @xmath00.5 g @xmath1 s@xmath2 , along with a relatively generic geometric orientation of the system , we find that in the ultraviolet either a single linear polarization pulse per binary orbit or two pulses per binary orbit can be expected , depending on the accretion column hydrodynamic structure ( one- or two - temperature ) modeled . under conditions where the physical flow is two - temperature , one pulse per orbit is predicted from a single accretion region where a one - temperature model predicts two pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity light curves show similar pulse behavior but there is very little difference between the circular polarization predictions of one- and two - temperature models . </S>",
    "<S> such discrepancies indicate that it is important to model some aspect of two - temperature flow in indirect imaging procedures , like stokes imaging , especially at the edges of extended accretion regions , were the specific mass flow is low , and especially for ultraviolet data . </S>"
