    "in the course of a search for nearby pre  main - sequence stars among hipparcos catalog stars with strong x - ray emission @xcite , e.  j. encountered the unusual star v474 car ( hip  44216 , cpd-62 1150 ) which spectroscopically appeared to be remarkably similar to a g - type t tauri star , with saturated x - ray emission and some h@xmath4 emission , but with a remarkably large radial velocity ( @xmath5 @xmath2 250 km  s@xmath0 ) . as there were indications that this star might be a runaway t tauri star , we conducted some follow - up observations to further characterize it",
    ".    there has been very little previous study of v474 car .",
    "the star was listed as a high proper motion star ( @xmath6 @xmath2 02/yr ) multiple times by luyten , and catalogued by @xcite as l 139 - 59 , ltt 3338 , and nltt 20802 .",
    "the star appeared in the 74th name list of variable stars as v474 car @xcite and is entry asas 090023 - 6300.1 in the all sky automated survey ( asas ) catalog of variable stars @xcite .",
    "the asas catalog lists v474 car as a by dra - type star with a period of 10.312 days , v - band amplitude of 0.16 mag and maximum brightness of v = 9.94 mag .",
    "@xcite listed v474 car as sacy 525 in their spectroscopic survey of southern rosat x - ray sources , and classified the star as being a g0ve star with large radial velocity ( @xmath5 = 247.8 km  s@xmath0 ) , slow projected rotation , but with lithium ( ew(li i @xmath76707.8 ) = 100 m ) , and weak h@xmath4 emission ( ew(h@xmath4 ) = @xmath8  ) .",
    "hence , this star simultaneously shows paradoxical characteristics of both youth and old age .",
    "here we report our observations of the mysterious star v474 car .",
    "we conclude that it is an extremely active , tight binary with an abundance pattern and space velocity consistent with belonging to the galactic halo population . the photometric period for v474 car matches the orbital period measured for the spectroscopic binary , confirming that v474 car is a tidally - locked , active binary , i.e.  an rs cvn system .",

    "integration times were typically 1 hour , in three 20 minute integrations , except on one night when we only took a single exposure .",
    "data reduction utilized a basic echelle reduction package .",
    "we also obtained six low dispersion spectra using the long - slit rc spectrograph .",
    "these were used for spectral classification , to determine the stellar activity level , and to search for evidence of a cool companion .",
    "we used a 1.5  arcsec slit and four standard low dispersion spectroscopic setups ( 26/ia , 47/ib , 47/ii , 58/i ) .",
    "we obtained three observations with integration times between 300 and 400 seconds , depending on the setup and the target brightness .",
    "the three observations were median - filtered to minimize contamination by cosmic rays .",
    "we reduced the data using our spectroscopic data reduction pipeline .",
    "at first glance this star is puzzling , since it presents both pre  main - sequence characteristics and halo population characteristics .",
    "if the star is placed on an hr diagram , assuming that reddening corrections are negligible and that the secondary contributes little light in the @xmath25 band , its position is consistent with a pre  main - sequence classification ( and indeed this is why we initially selected it for observation ) .",
    "in addition , we measure modest h@xmath4 emission ( equivalent width@xmath26  ) and find a lithium equivalent width from the @xmath76707.8 line of 91.1 m .",
    "all of these indicators are consistent with youth , which could imply that the star may be a `` runaway '' post - t tauri star . however , the kinematics are also similar to that of halo stars . in order to clarify the status of this potentially interesting object",
    ", we now present a variety of analyses .",
    "we first discuss the kinematics , including disentangling the effects of binary orbital motion from those of overall space motion of the system .",
    "we then discuss the star s x - ray emission , and we conclude this section with a high resolution spectroscopic abundance analysis .",
    "our first two observations , in 2001 and 2003 , gave radial velocities differing by 16 km  s@xmath0 , suggesting that the system is a spectroscopic binary , so we made additional radial velocity observations .",
    "the measured velocities are given in table [ table : velocities ] .",
    "we fit the radial velocity data using the binary star combined solution software @xcite and our own custom - written idl code ; both gave the same solution .",
    "the best - fit phased radial velocity curve is shown in figure [ figure : binary_orbit ] , and the orbital parameters are given in table [ table : orbital_params ] .",
    "the eccentricity is formally consistent with a circular orbit ; forcing a circular orbit in the fit gives the same orbital parameters to within the uncertainties given in table [ table : orbital_params ] . in doing the fitting",
    ", we found that the three data points taken in january and february of 2010 were systematically low compared to the best - fit orbit .",
    "the camera for the spectrograph was removed from the dewar in december 2009 , and we suspect that our reduction pipeline does not yet fully correct for a small rotation introduced when this change was made .",
    "thus , we have applied an empirical @xmath27 km  s@xmath0  correction to those three datapoints , both in table [ table : velocities ] and in the final orbital fit . however , even if we do not apply that correction , the orbital parameters are unchanged to within their quoted uncertainties .",
    "the orbital fit yields a mass function of @xmath28 m@xmath29 , and thus this can also be used to place limits on the secondary mass . based on our derived stellar parameters for the primary ( sec.[section : spec - analysis ] ) , we interpolated yale - yonsei isochrones with a metallicity of our derived value ( [ fe / h]=-0.97 : discussed below ) to yield an approximate primary mass of 0.9 @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ figure : secondary_mass ] , this constrains the secondary mass to greater than 0.25 m@xmath29 .",
    "thus , it is likely to be a late k or m type companion , and it is plausible ( especially for larger values of @xmath31 ) that we would not see any sign of it in our spectra .",
    "we can place constraints on the inclination of the primary star s rotation axis by comparing the inferred stellar rotation period with its projected equatorial rotational velocity @xmath32 and also taking the star s radius into account .",
    "the yale - yonsei isochrones @xcite yield an approximate primary stellar radius of 1.9 @xmath33 , which is consistent with a radius of 1.5 - 2.0 r@xmath29 inferred from the barnes - evans relation @xcite ( uncertainty comes solely from parallax and neglects systematic metallicity or interstellar reddening effects ) . combining this with @xmath34 and @xmath32 ( table [ table : pp ] ) suggests a high value for @xmath31 ( within @xmath35 of 1 ) . assuming that the stellar rotation axis is perpendicular to the binary orbit , this would imply a nearly edge - on orbit .",
    "though no eclipses are evident in the photometric data , an edge - on orbit would give a companion mass of 0.26 @xmath30 . while yale - yonsei models do not go to this low of a mass , the lowest mass available in these models ( 0.40 @xmath30",
    "yield a secondary stellar radius of 0.17 @xmath33 .",
    "as a plausibility study , this would imply an eclipse depth of only 0.8 % , .which is undetectable given the existing photometry .",
    "it is worth noting however , given our derived secondary characteristics , that it is possibly a white dwarf .",

    "rs cvns typically have @xmath32 values in the tens of km  s@xmath0 , consistent with what we measure from our spectroscopic analysis ( table [ table : pp ] ) .",
    "km  s@xmath0  reported by @xcite is a typo and should be 11.7 km  s@xmath0  ( c. melo , personal communication , 2010 ) . ]      a recent compilation by @xcite records @xmath3400 known chromospherically active binaries ( cabs ) , with 164 explicitly classified as rs cvn systems .",
    "there are indications that v474 car is fairly unusual compared to the majority of known rs cvn systems .",
    "we cross - correlated all cabs in @xcite with the revised hipparcos catalog and the compiled radial velocity catalog of @xcite .",
    "we estimated galactic cartesian ( uvw ) velocities for all cabs with positive hipparcos parallaxes and radial velocities in @xcite .",
    "for those 251 cabs with velocities known to better than 50% accuracy , we find that v474 car s velocity ( s @xmath90 km  s@xmath0 ) exceeds the heliocentric velocity of _ all _ of these systems .",
    "the highest velocity star from @xcite s compilation is hip 81170 with s @xmath91 km  s@xmath0 , the only hip star in that catalog with velocity greater than 200 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite conducted an x - ray survey of population ii , metal - poor binaries , and listed a sub - sample of 12 population ii binaries showing significant chromospheric emission ( in this case , the ca h & k line ) . combining the revised hipparcos astrometry @xcite with the compiled radial velocity catalog of @xcite , we calculated uvw velocities for these 12 emission - line pop ii binaries .",
    "we find that only two systems have heliocentric velocities greater than that of v474 car : cd@xmath1148 1741 ( hip 24742 ) with s @xmath92 km  s@xmath0 , and dr oct ( hd 89499 , hip 49616 ) with s @xmath93 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "cd@xmath1148 1741 is arguably the most dynamically similar to v474 car , with orbital period 7.56 days ,",
    "[ fe / h ] @xmath94 @xcite , subgiant gravity for the primary ( @xmath95 4.00 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and retrograde galactic orbit ( @xmath96 km  s@xmath0 ) . despite its similarity to v474 car in orbital period and distance , cd@xmath1148 1741 was not detected in x - rays in the rosat all - sky survey , and its variability is much more subtle ( no photometric period was reported in the hipparcos catalog or in the aavso index ) .",
    "dr oct is a single - lined spectroscopic binary with an evolved g - type primary , 5.57 day orbital period @xcite , [ fe / h ] @xmath97 @xcite , enhanced li compared to halo dwarfs @xcite , and it appears to be the most metal - poor star to have its x - ray spectrum taken @xcite . while dr oct is variable , no photometric period has been reported .",
    "it appears that among the @xcite pop ii binaries , dr oct may be the most similar analog to v474 car , with its retrograde galactic orbit and its x - ray - luminous , evolved , li - rich g - type primary .",
    "starting in 1981 , latham , carney , and collaborators conducted a long - term spectroscopic and radial velocity survey of high proper motion stars , many of which are halo stars . among the spectroscopic binaries reported by @xcite , they showed that the transition between apparently tidally - locked ( @xmath98 ) tight binaries and the `` normal '' wide - separation binaries with a wide range of eccentricities appears near orbital period @xmath320 days .",
    "v474 car s zero eccentricity orbit is consistent with the @xmath99 day binary population observed by @xcite . among the 15 single - lined spectroscopic binaries from @xcite with orbital periods of @xmath100 days , only one has space velocity of @xmath101 km  s@xmath0 according to @xcite . that star is g 65 - 22 ( hip 68527 , lhs 2846 , ross 838 )",
    ", the primary of which is an unevolved @xmath30.6 m@xmath102 dwarf with [ m / h ] @xmath103 .",
    "@xcite identified 34 double - lined spectroscopic binaries among the carney - latham sample . of these , only two had orbital periods of @xmath104 days and space velocity from @xcite of @xmath101 km  s@xmath0(g 66 - 59 , g 183 - 9 ) , and the primaries for both systems are , again , unevolved metal - poor @xmath105 m@xmath102 dwarfs .",
    "hence , the carney - latham sample of halo stars contains a few rare examples of metal - poor , tight binaries that are _ dwarfs _ , but no evolved specimens like v474 car .",
    "@xcite found that while halo and disk stars have surprisingly similar binary frequencies and distributions of orbital parameters , there is a significant difference between the binary frequency of halo stars in prograde orbits ( @xmath327% ) versus those in retrograde orbits ( @xmath311% ; like v474 car ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that given the difference in binarity may be due to the retrograde population containing a significant population of stars from an object ( perhaps @xmath106 cen ? ) that was captured by the milky way .",
    "if so , v474 car may be a rare binary member of this purportedly accreted population .",
    "v474 car s galactic orbit is notable for its extreme eccentricity . in the geneva - copenhagen survey of f /",
    "g - type stars in the solar neighborhood @xcite , only nine of the 16,682 stars ( 0.05% ) in the survey have an eccentricity greater than or equal to that of v474 car , and only six of the 16,682 ( 0.04% ) have a smaller perigalacticon .",
    "none of those stars , however , are detected in x - rays in the rosat all - sky survey bright source catalog @xcite or faint source catalog @xcite .",
    "all of those stars are metal poor ( @xmath107 [ fe / h ] @xmath108 ) , as is v474 car ( [ fe / h ] @xmath87 ;  3.5 ) .",
    "we have presented a robust analysis of v474 car , a rare metal poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath87 ) rs cvn binary with halo kinematics .",
    "the star was originally selected in a survey for young , nearby stars due to enhanced li and h@xmath4 emission , however its extreme heliocentric velocity ( @xmath109 km  s@xmath0 ) was the first indication that this was no typical pre - ms star .",
    "the star is a single - lined spectroscopic binary with evolved g - type primary and a probable k / m - type secondary with orbital period synchronous with the photometrically - constrained rotational period of the primary ( p @xmath2 10.3 days ) .",
    "the asas light curve of the primary also manifests a modulation with a @xmath36 year period and @xmath30.1 mag amplitude , perhaps due to a long - term activity cycle .",
    "the star has an eccentricity for its galactic orbit surpassed by only @xmath580.05% of f / g - type field stars , and its orbit is mildly retrograde ( @xmath110 km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "the star has few peers , with cd@xmath1148 1741 and dr oct being perhaps the closest analogs as rare halo rs cvns .",
    "its x - ray luminosity and hardness of soft x - ray emission as measured by rosat appears similar to that of normal disk rs cvn stars .",
    "v474 car may become an important target for studying the effects of low metallicity on stellar coronae and stellar activity cycles .",
