    "cooperative light - matter interaction @xcite plays an important role in the aspects of correlated spontaneous emissions , quantum entanglement @xcite , and preparation of exotic quantum states @xcite .",
    "superradiance @xcite and associated cooperative lamb shift ( cls ) @xcite are examples that demonstrate the collectivity in exchanging photons within an atomic ensemble .",
    "subradiance , on the other hand , is a less aware collective effect complementary to the superradiance , which spontaneously emits light in a rate lower than the natural one .",
    "single - photon superradiance @xcite and subradiance are of great interests in that the dimensionality of the hilbert space is restricted to the order of the number of atoms @xmath0 only , thus simplifies the dynamical couplings with each other .",
    "resonant dipole - dipole interaction @xcite is regarded to initiate the superradiance with properties of directional emissions in an enhanced spontaneous decay rate .",
    "because of its spatial dependence in the short range ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) and the long range ( @xmath1 @xmath3 ) , the decay behavior heavily depends on the density and geometry of the interacting medium , and additionally excitation polarizations .",
    "recent experiments demonstrated a shorter timescale of the second - order correlation of two photons in the cascade atomic ensembles @xcite , and a significant redshift of cls in various atomic systems including the embedded fe atoms in the planar cavity @xcite , an atomic vapor @xcite , an ionic atomic array @xcite , and a cold atomic ensemble @xcite .",
    "subradiant lifetime was also recently measured in plasmonic ring nanocavities @xcite , ultracold molecules @xcite , and a cold atomic ensemble @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we investigate the construction of singly - excited states which are candidates for superradiance and subradiance emerged from the resonant dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "we introduce the cooperative single - photon subradiant states that can be prepared in our proposed scheme by imprinting the required phases via a pulsed gradient magnetic or electric fields .  in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the experimental realizations of the subradiant states , and we show the time evolutions of these subradiant states that can be measured in fluorescence experiments in sec .",
    "finally we address the influence of the phase imperfections and conclude in sec .",
    "in a setting where a ( near ) resonant single photon is driving a system of two - level atoms ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the atomic ground and excited sates respectively ) , the superradiance and accompanied cls @xcite emerge from the symmetrical and singly - excited state or timed dicke state @xcite , |_n=_=1^n e^i_|e_|g^(n-1 ) , where @xmath6 is the wavevector of the excitation pulse of a single photon , and the tensor product denotes the rest of ( @xmath7 ) ground state atoms other than the one being excited , that is @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "since the symmetrical state is approximately decoupled from the rest of ( @xmath7 ) orthogonal and nonsymmetrical ( ns ) states @xmath11 , the emission long after the superradiance ( afterglow if there is any because of extremely low probability in the limit of extended medium ) suggests the occupation of the these states @xcite",
    ".  these ns states responsible for the spontaneous emission in a rate lower than the natural decay one are subradiant states , which were observed in a large cloud of cold atoms @xcite .",
    "a recent proposal also suggested for preparation and detection of subradiant states in the scheme based on subensembles @xcite .",
    "a complete hilbert space for a single photon interacting with the atomic ensemble has been proposed for these normalized ns states @xcite ,    [ @xmath12 , @xmath7 ] with @xmath14 @xmath9 @xmath15 .",
    "an alternative construction of the complete space is proposed in terms of dicke s states where the formalism of singlet and triplet states in the angular momentum eigenstates provides the foundation to construct the hilbert space @xcite , |_m=. the difference of the above two ns states is that the first involves all the atoms whereas the second involves a subset of atoms in specific positions .",
    "in the perspective of experimental preparation of those ns states , both require exquisite control on the coefficients of the constituent atoms , including the amplitudes and phases .",
    "an issue associated with that is those analytic ns states are not the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , and separately assessing each ns state through global control is difficult to achieve .",
    "as such it may require complicated individual addressing fields with sub - wavelength resolution in order to independently manipulate each and every constituent atom @xcite .  alternatively subradiant states can be prepared in the setting of spatially - separated subensembles @xcite , in which preparation of specific subradiant states is more feasible , though more resources are required for more subensembles .",
    "below we propose a complete space that involves all the atoms collectively , which can be prepared in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice ( ol ) with one atom per site .",
    "the states are prepared by a pulsed global control field following a single - photon excitation with equal probability on every atom , thus greatly improves their practical accessibility experimentally .      to construct the complete n states for single - photon excitation , we exploit de moivre s formula which is originally used for the nth root of unity , that is for a complex number @xmath16 such that @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath12 .  we take the roots of @xmath19 @xmath18 @xmath12 as indications of the coefficients for the so - called de moivre ( dm ) states we propose in the below , which are @xmath20 for @xmath21 @xmath22",
    "[ @xmath12 , @xmath0 ] .",
    "the identity of the sum of all roots , sr(@xmath24 ) @xmath18 @xmath25 for all @xmath24 except for @xmath24 @xmath18 @xmath12 , indicates the orthogonality of the dm states .",
    "we construct the complete hilbert space with the dm states including the symmetric one @xmath26 @xcite ,    orthonormality @xmath27 @xmath18 @xmath28 @xmath18 @xmath29 .  in each dm state the phases of the atoms in the 1d ol increase",
    "discretely and linearly while the amplitudes of the coefficients are equal .",
    "this contrasts the dm states with the aforementioned ns states where both the amplitudes and the phases of their coefficients need to be specifically constructed .",
    "the dm states also remind us of the discrete fourier transform in that their coefficients are exactly the fourier series bases since the coefficients @xmath30 are @xmath0-periodic .",
    "we note that the dm states introduced here are correlated ones induced by the long - ranged dipole - dipole interaction , which is responsible for the cooperative spontaneous emissions , and they can be prepared in a collective way by an external field gradient .     evolved by a unitary transformation @xmath31 .",
    "( b ) schematic demonstration of single photon absorption by 1d atomic array to form @xmath26 followed by a pulsed magnetic field gradient to imprint the necessary phases of the dm states .",
    "( c ) quantum memory protocol for quantum storage of single photon .",
    "after single photon absorption , the system is excited to @xmath26 as in ( a ) , and the subradiant state is prepared and evolved from @xmath26 by @xmath32 for quantum storage with a time delay @xmath33 .",
    "the storage protocol reads out the photon by @xmath34 @xmath18 @xmath35.,width=321,height=245 ]",
    "to illustrate , we first propose to use a magnetic field gradient to introduce the linearly increasing phases along the 1d ol shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .  the system can be first prepared in @xmath26 by absorbing a single photon .",
    "then a gradient zeeman field is pulsed on to evolve @xmath26 to @xmath36 .",
    "this evolution can be described by a unitary transformation @xmath31",
    "@xmath9 @xmath37 , where the interaction energy @xmath38 @xmath18 @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the interaction time .",
    "after the evolution the spatial phases of @xmath41 @xmath18 @xmath42 are imprinted on the atoms in the @xmath43 zeeman sublevel of the @xmath44 hyperfine state .",
    "here @xmath45 is the land @xmath46 factor , @xmath47 is the bohr magneton , @xmath48 is field gradient , and @xmath16 represents the positions of the atoms .  the measurement of fluorescence afterwards verifies the state we prepare , which therefore provides a systematic way to study super- and sub - radiance of the cooperative single - photon dm states .",
    "the subradiant state can be made to store light quanta for much longer time , thus is potentially useful for quantum memory of light @xcite .",
    "we use the d@xmath49 transition of @xmath50rb atoms as an example , and we choose the ground and excited states as @xmath51s@xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 with @xmath45 @xmath18 @xmath55 and @xmath51p@xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 with @xmath45 @xmath18 @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the required phase difference for two adjacent sites is @xmath60 for the @xmath21th dm states , with @xmath21 @xmath18 @xmath61 .",
    "thus to access the whole hilbert space of the dm states , the maximum phase difference needs to be as large as @xmath62",
    ".  therefore @xmath48 should be as large as @xmath63 in unit of [ mg@xmath64 m ] , with the pulse duration @xmath65 in milliseconds and the lattice spacing @xmath66 in @xmath67 which is @xmath68 nm for the d@xmath49 transition .  for the order of @xmath66 @xmath18 @xmath12 we consider here",
    ", the field gradient would be around @xmath69 mg@xmath64 m for @xmath70 microseconds of interaction time , which is within reach of typical experiments .  in the perspective of preparing a specific @xmath21th dm state , a longer atomic chain of larger @xmath0",
    "also requires a less field gradient or a shorter interaction time to imprint the phase gradients across the whole chain .",
    "for example of @xmath0 @xmath18 @xmath71 we will demonstrate later , the field gradient just requires @xmath72 mg@xmath64 m or the interaction time becomes @xmath73 nanoseconds to prepare @xmath21 @xmath18 @xmath70 dm state which still has a reduction of decay rate in the order of @xmath74 .",
    "an issue of qmp in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , however , is the lack of efficiency due to the creation of the superradiant state in the beginning of the dm state preparation , which decays faster than the free space decay rate ( @xmath75 @xmath76 ns ) .",
    "the efficiency can be estimated as @xmath77 where @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 ns@xmath81 is the decay rate of the superradiant state we initially prepare .  to get around this low efficiency",
    ", we can utilize linear stark shift to imprint the required phases in a rate of @xmath70 s mhz to restore the efficiency in qmp .",
    "both continuous wave and ultrashort light pulse can be used to fast control the phases with higher efficiency , and a sidewise single - photon excitation with @xmath82 phase shifters switches between super- and sub - radiant states in an ultrashort time scale was proposed @xcite .",
    "the ac stark shift can be calculated as @xmath83 @xmath18 @xmath84 @xmath18 @xmath85 , where @xmath86 @xmath18 @xmath87 @xcite , in the limit of large detuning from the d@xmath49 transition by using a laser field , where rotating wave approximation is still valid .  here @xmath88 is the static atom polarizability @xcite .  on preparing @xmath21th dm state",
    ", we then estimate the required maximum ac stark field intensity as @xmath89 @xmath75 @xmath90 [ mw/@xmath91 with an interaction time of @xmath12 ns and @xmath21 @xmath92 @xmath93 .",
    "this can be readily achieved by a typical pulsed laser .",
    "for example , given a pulsed laser with an average power of @xmath73 mw , a repetition rate of @xmath12 khz , and a pulse width of @xmath12 ns , when it is focused to a waist of @xmath94 @xmath95 m , its peak intensity is as high as @xmath96 @xmath18 @xmath90 mw/@xmath97 .  with a continuous wave laser at a much smaller detuning ,",
    "say @xmath98 @xmath18 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 , then the linear stark field gradient requires an intensity of @xmath89 @xmath100 @xmath102 mw/@xmath97 for @xmath12 ns interaction time for preparing the @xmath21 @xmath18 @xmath103 dm state .",
    "this can be achieved by focusing a @xmath93 mw laser to a beam waist of @xmath94 @xmath95 m .",
    "irrespective of the recipes introduced above for phase imprinting , with heralded single photon source and post selection , the distilled write efficiency should be greatly restored in the preparation of the dm states for applications in many - body physics and quantum memory .",
    "the technique of position - dependent phase imprinting @xcite reminds us of controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening ( crib ) that is used to implement the quantum memory of light in two - level atoms of praseodymium dopants in yttrium orthosilicate ( pr@xmath104:y@xmath49sio@xmath105 ) @xcite or warm @xmath106-type rubidium vapour @xcite , where crib is introduced for efficient absorption of light .  in the case here",
    ", the inhomogeneous field is to unitarily introduce the spatial phases to the atoms after absorption of the light quanta .",

    "[ fig2 ] we show the coupling strengths for the dm states , and find that small coupling strengths mostly lie at lattice spacings less than @xmath119 .",
    "the period of @xmath120 in @xmath110 for the coupling strengths is due to the sinusoidal functions in the dipole - dipole interaction , which is equivalent to a period of @xmath82 .",
    "similar periodic coupling strengths are demonstrated in infinite atomic lattices with a period of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the coupling strengths saturate quickly as @xmath0 increases , therefore here we show for the case of @xmath0 @xmath18 @xmath107 without loss of generality .",

    "these specific dm states will be shown later to demonstrate the smallest decay rates ( longest lifetimes ) .",
    "next we investigate the time evolution of the dm states which can be observable in the fluorescence experiments .",
    "since the resonant dipole - dipole interaction is long ranged , there is no exact analytical form of the eigenstates in a finite 1d ol .",
    "therefore the dm states we prepare in the 1d ol would simultaneously couple to several eigenstates that we numerically solved .  in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the normalized weightings ( projections ) defined in appendix b for dm states .  the weightings indicate how significantly the eigenvalues @xmath125 s contribute to the time evolution of the dm states , and generally they are highly localized within two to three eigenstates .",
