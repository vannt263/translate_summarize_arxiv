    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite continues to be one of the best - motivated and most intensely studied extensions of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "it introduces a symmetry between fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom in nature and predicts one fermionic ( bosonic ) supersymmetric ( susy ) partner for each bosonic ( fermionic ) sm particle .",
    "consequently , it allows to stabilize the gap between the electroweak and the planck scale @xcite and to unify the three gauge couplings at energies of @xmath0 gev @xcite .",
    "it also contains a stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which interacts only weakly and represents therefore an excellent candidate for cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "spin partners of the sm particles have not yet been observed , and in order to remain a viable solution to the hierarchy problem , susy must be broken at low energy via soft terms in the lagrangian . as a consequence ,",
    "the susy particles must be massive in comparison to their sm counterparts , and the tevatron and the lhc will perform a conclusive search covering a wide range of masses up to the tev scale .    the production of susy particles at hadron colliders has been studied at leading order ( lo ) of perturbative qcd since the 1980s @xcite .",
    "more recently , previously neglected electroweak contributions @xcite , polarization effects @xcite , and the violation of flavor @xcite and @xmath1 symmetry @xcite have been considered at this order .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections have been computed within qcd since the late 1990s @xcite and recently also within the electroweak theory @xcite .",
    "resummation at the next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) level has been achieved in the small transverse - momentum region for sleptons and gauginos @xcite , in the threshold region for sleptons , squarks and gluinos @xcite , and for sleptons and additional neutral gauge bosons also in both regions simultaneously @xcite .    as the fermionic partners of the electroweak gauge and higgs bosons , the four neutralino @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and chargino @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) mass eigenstates are superpositions of the neutral and charged gaugino and higgsino interaction eigenstates .",
    "their decays into leptons and missing transverse energy , carried away by the @xmath6 lsp , are easily identifiable at hadron colliders .",
    "the lighter mass eigenstates are accessible not only at the lhc with center - of - mass energies @xmath7 of 7 to 14 tev , but also at run ii of the tevatron ( @xmath8 tev ) , where the production of @xmath9 pairs decaying into trilepton final states is a gold - plated susy discovery channel @xcite . for this particular channel",
    ", threshold resummation has been studied previously within the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model @xcite .",
    "it was found that threshold resummation could increase the total cross section by up to 4.7% at the tevatron relative to the nlo prediction , i.e.  was significant even relatively far from the hadronic production threshold .    in this work ,",
    "we extend and improve on these published results in several respects .",
    "first , we extend the original nlo calculation @xcite by also including squark mixing effects .",
    "second , we include not only the qcd , but also the susy - qcd virtual loop contributions in the hard coefficient function of the resummed cross section , which therefore reproduces , when expanded , the correct nlo susy - qcd cross section in the threshold region .",
    "third , we resum not only the diagonal , but the full matrix contributions coming from the anomalous dimension , thereby including all universal subleading terms and full singlet mixing .",
    "however , we refrain from resumming constant terms that are known to factorize and exponentiate in drell - yan like processes , but not in more complex processes like gaugino pair production with several interfering born diagrams . for the tevatron , we consider not only the production of @xmath9 , but also of @xmath10 and @xmath11 pairs . in particular",
    "the latter can have significantly larger cross sections than trilepton production due to the @xmath12-channel exchange of massless photons .",
    "for the lhc , we concentrate on predictions for its initial center - of - mass energy of @xmath137 tev and include also the production of heavy gaugino ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) combinations , where threshold effects and direct gaugino pair production ( as opposed to the production from squark and gluino cascade decays ) will be more important",
    ". however , we will also show cross sections for @xmath1314 tev for comparison .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we present briefly our lo and nlo susy - qcd calculations , focusing on squark mixing , the ultraviolet renormalization procedure and the dipole subtraction method employed for the cancellation of infrared divergences among virtual and real contributions . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we describe the threshold resummation formalism in mellin space , starting from the refactorization of the perturbative cross section and the exponentiation of the eikonal function , giving then the explicit form of the resummed logarithms at nll order , and finally describing various ways to improve on the original formalism .",
    "sec.[sec:4 ] contains numerical results for various gaugino pair production cross sections at the tevatron and at the lhc in both graphical and tabular form .",
    "it also includes a comprehensive analysis of theoretical errors coming from scale and parton density uncertainties .",
    "we summarize our results in sec.[sec:5 ] .",
    "our conventions for the couplings of quarks and squarks to weak gauge bosons and gauginos are defined in the appendix .",
    "at hadron colliders , two gauginos @xmath16 with masses @xmath17 and four - momenta @xmath18 can be produced at lo of perturbation theory only through the annihilation of quarks @xmath19 and antiquarks @xmath20 with four - momenta @xmath21 , q(p_a )  |q(p_b ) & & _",
    "i(p_1 )  _ j(p_2 ) , [ eq:1 ] since gluons couple neither to electroweak gauge / higgs bosons nor to their susy partners .-",
    "channel higgs - boson exchanges , which may be produced by initial - state gluons through top - quark loops . ] as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the production can proceed either    through the @xmath12-channel exchange of a photon ( @xmath22 ) , neutral ( @xmath23 ) or charged ( @xmath24 ) weak gauge boson , depending on the charge of the final state , or through the @xmath25- and @xmath26-channel exchange of a squark ( @xmath27 ) , where the mandelstam variables s  =  ( p_a+p_b)^2 & , & t  =  ( p_a - p_1)^2 u  =  ( p_a - p_2)^2 and their mass - subtracted counterparts @xmath28 and @xmath29 are defined in the usual way .",
    ".[tab:1]@xmath12-channel charges for gaugino pair production .",
    "the masses of the @xmath24- and @xmath23-bosons are @xmath30 and @xmath31 . + [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     channel in our different benchmark scenarios at the lhc with its current center - of - mass energy of @xmath32 tev .",
    "since the masses of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are always rather similar , one expects also similar total cross sections .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by the @xmath32 tev results in tab.[tab:3 ] and the numbers in tab .",
    "[ tab:5 ] with the notable exceptions of lm7 and lm9 , where the cross section is about a factor of two and one order of magnitude larger than for the other points , respectively .",
    "this is partly due to the lower gaugino masses at lm9 and partly to the much heavier squark masses , which suppress the @xmath25- and @xmath26-channels and thus their destructive interference with the @xmath12-channel amplitudes .",
    "the additional jet veto ( jv ) , i.e.  the rejection of events containing jets with transverse momentum @xmath35 gev , envisaged by the atlas collaboration to suppress the background from top quark pair production , has obviously no consequences at lo , since gauginos are exclusively produced at this order .",
    "an additional quark or gluon can only be present at nlo or nll+nlo , and restricting its transverse momentum to low values reduces the total cross sections slightly with respect to the unrestricted predictions .",
    "the small reduction of the signal cross section in combination with a large reduction of the background should therefore indeed lead to a much better significance .",
    "in summary , we presented in this paper a complete analysis of threshold resummation effects on direct light and heavy gaugino pair production at the tevatron and at the lhc with its current , intermediate , and design center - of - mass energies .",
    "we confirmed the existing nlo calculation and extended it to include also mixing effects for intermediate squarks .",
    "soft gluon radiation in the threshold region was resummed at leading and next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy into a sudakov exponential , and the full susy - qcd corrections were retained in the finite coefficient function .",
    "this allowed us to correctly match the resummed cross section at nll accuracy to the nlo perturbative cross section .",
    "universal subleading logarithms coming from the splitting of initial partons were resummed in full matrix form , i.e.  including also non - diagonal splittings .",
    "we found that resummation increased the invariant mass spectra and total cross sections only slightly , but stabilized the reorganized perturbative series considerably with respect to the fixed - order calculation . for future reference ,",
    "we presented total cross sections with the corresponding theoretical errors from scale and pdf variations at lo , nlo and nll+nlo in tabular form for several commonly used susy benchmark points , light and heavy gaugino pairs , and various hadron collider types and energies .",
