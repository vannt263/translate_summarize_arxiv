    "stellar and planetary magnetic environments or magnetospheres are generated by the motion of charged particles inside the core of stars and planets . in the magnetosphere of the earth ,",
    "incoming charged particles have intricate trajectories and are in the origin of observable radiation phenomena as is the case of radiation aurorae @xcite , the van allen inner radiation belts @xcite , and the south atlantic anomaly @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field of the earth has a strong dipolar component , @xcite , and it is believed that , for low altitudes ( @xmath0 ) , the radiation phenomena occurring in the earth magnetosphere can be understood by studying the motion of nonrelativistic charged particles in a pure dipole field . if the dipolar component of the earth magnetic field is considered aligned with the rotation axis of the earth , the equations of motion of a charged particle in the dipolar field of the earth reduce to a non - linear autonomous hamiltonian dynamical system .",
    "this is the strmer problem , @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the strmer problem presents big challenges from the theoretical , applied and computational points of view .    from the computational point of view , the determination of the trajectories of high energy charged particles in the earth magnetosphere for long periods of time is inaccurate and time consuming , being difficult to extract information about the several aspects of the radiation phenomena observed in the earth magnetosphere .",
    "for example , in order to explain some of the dynamic aspects associated with aurorae and magnetic mirrors , adiabatic _ ad - hoc _ arguments have been introduced into the theory , and the motion of charged particles in the magnetosphere has been assumed similar to the cyclotron type motion in constant magnetic fields , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the long lived and transient radiation belts observed in the earth magnetosphere have adverse effects on the electronics of spacecrafts , and affect communications , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore , a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the strmer problem has important applications .",
    "the first theoretical studies about the properties of the trajectories of charged particle in a dipolar field where done by @xcite and @xcite . in the work of these authors , the existence of a trapping region for charged particles in the dipole field of the earth was implicitly established .    based on the qualitative theory of conservative maps of the plane , @xcite carried a comparative study between the phase space topology of the orbits of a generic area - preserving map of the plane and the numerically computed poincar sections of the strmer problem .",
    "they have presented numerical evidence about the existence of homoclinic points in the poincar sections . according to these authors",
    ", this shows that the strmer problem is insoluble , implying that the adiabatic magnetic moment series diverges , a basic theoretical argument used by van allen to explain some features of the radiation phenomena in planetary magnetospheres .",
    "the kam approach to the strmer problem has been developed by braun in a sequence of papers , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . within this approach",
    ", it has been shown that trapped particles can have quasi - periodic motion , and can penetrate arbitrarily close to the dipole axis .    due to its intrinsic difficulty , the analysis of the strmer problem has been done using a mixture of analytical and numerical techniques . here , we are interested in surveying the exact results on the strmer problem , separating the results that are numeric from the exact ones .",
    "all the exact results are summarized in propositions [ p1 ] and [ p2 ] .",
    "we have made extensive simulations of trajectories of charged particles in the earth magnetosphere , and we have obtained the shape of the trapping regions for charged particles  van allen inner radiation belts .",
    "this contrast with the usual approach used in radiation environment studies , where radiation belt boundaries are correlated with the dipole field lines , @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",

    "for that , we develop in taylor series around the points @xmath205 and @xmath206 the second members of the differential equations in ( [ eq18 ] ) . by proposition [ p1 ] , at these points the motion is integrable and periodic in the equatorial plane of the earth . in the first case , the differential equations ( [ eq18 ] ) become , @xmath207\\displaystyle \\ddot z = 0 \\end{array}\\right . \\label{se5eq6}\\ ] ] and , in the second case , we obtain , @xmath208\\displaystyle \\ddot z = -{3c_{2}^6\\over 64 m^6 \\alpha_1 ^ 4 } z\\ , . \\end{array}\\right . \\label{se5eq7}\\ ] ] as the solutions of the linear equations ( [ se5eq6 ] ) and ( [ se5eq7 ] ) are unbounded , we loose the property of boundness already contained in proposition [ p2]-_(i ) _ and also the possibility of having a family of invariant two - dimensional torus in the four - dimensional phase space of the unperturbed systems ( [ se5eq6 ] ) and ( [ se5eq7 ] ) .    the other way of characterizing the dynamics of the charged particles in the van allen inner belt is to find a poincar map for the equations of motion ( [ eq18 ] ) .",
    "we consider that at most one of the coordinates @xmath173 and @xmath174 of the initial condition of the differential equation ( [ eq18 ] ) is different from zero , and the particle has bounded motion ( @xmath163 ) . to avoid degenerate situations , we also consider that , @xmath175 and the effective energy function is positive , @xmath209 . under these conditions , by proposition [ p2]-_(i ) _ , the initial condition is on a compact component of the level sets of the hamiltonian function ( [ eq20 ] ) .",

    "these level sets are compact , provided @xmath210 .",
    "the compact level sets of the hamiltonian function are three - dimensional compact manifolds embedded in the four dimensional phase space , and their intersection with the three - dimensional hyperplane @xmath53 is a two - dimensional compact manifold @xmath211 .",
    "this two - dimensional manifold is a compact set in the four dimensional phase space of the differential equation ( [ eq18 ] ) and , by ( [ eq20 ] ) , has local coordinates @xmath84 and @xmath212 .    in the conditions of proposition [ p2]-_(i ) _ , any orbit initiated in an initial condition on the effective energy level sets can cross the hyperplane @xmath53 , intersecting transversally the two - dimensional compact manifold @xmath211 .",
    "therefore , the compact two - dimensional manifold @xmath211 is a good candidate for a poincar section of the differential equation ( [ eq18 ] ) .",
    "this construction is used to justify the existence of two - dimensional conservative poincar maps for two - degrees of freedom hamiltonian systems , ( @xcite , pp .",
    "17 - 20 ) . however , there are two main difficulties in proving that @xmath211 is the domain of a poincar map . the first case , it is difficult to prove that any trajectory that crosses transversally the section @xmath211 will return to it after a finite time .",
    "the second difficult questions concerns the unicity of the trajectories crossing the plane @xmath53 .    from proposition [ p2]-_(i )",
    "_ , it follows that there are orbits of trapped particles that never cross @xmath211 .",
    "however , due to the invariance of the differential equation ( [ eq18 ] ) for transformations of @xmath213 into @xmath214 , any initial condition on the plane @xmath53 with @xmath215 , has a prolongation for positive and negative values of @xmath213 , crossing transversally the plane @xmath53 at most once .",
    "with this property , we can test numerically the structure of the orbits that cross the set @xmath211 . in figure [ fig5 ] , we show the computed orbits on the poincar section @xmath211 , for two families of initial conditions and the same value of the constant of motion @xmath57 .    .",

    "it has been shown that the trajectories of charged particles can be periodic and quasi - periodic , and that , for a suitable choice of the initial conditions in between a minimal and maximal height from the equatorial plane , the planes perpendicular to the dipole axis are invariant for the motion of charged particles .    from a more global point of view , the trajectories of the charged particles in the earth dipole field can be trapped in a torus - like region surrounding the earth , or can be scattered and escape to infinity . the torus - like trapping region around the earth can be interpreted as the van allen inner radiation belt , as measured by particle detectors in spacecrafts .",
    "the physical effects associated with radiation phenomena intrinsic to accelerated charged particles ( _ bremsstrahlung _ ) account for the phenomena of radiation aurorae .",
    "the numerically computed trajectories of trapped charged particles suggests the existence of chaotic motion inside the van allen inner belts around the dipole axis of the earth .",

    ", the strmer problem deviates from the real situation in essentially three ways . in the first case",
    ", the magnetic field of the earth has a strong quadrupolar component that was not considered .",
    "the second drastic simplification has to do with the fact that the dipole axis is not coincident with the rotation axis of the earth .",
    "the rotation of the earth introduces a time periodic forcing into the equations of motion . in the third simplification ,",
    "we have considered implicitly that charged particles do not radiate ( _ bremsstrahlung _ ) when subject to accelerating forces .",

    "the existence of periodic , quasi - periodic and chaotic trajectories in the strmer problem together with the _ bremsstrahlung _ effect , shows that radiation belts make a shield protection for the high energy charged particles arriving at earth .",

    "on the other hand , the arguments used in the construction of poincar sections in two - degrees of freedom hamiltonian systems with two conservation laws lead to the non - unicity of the orbits on these surfaces of section .",
