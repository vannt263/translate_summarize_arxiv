    "the question as to whether graviton can have a mass is an old one .",
    "a recent review of the literature can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we give a very brief review of the main progress and major difficulties encountered in constructing a healthy massive gravity theory .",
    "it is well - known that fierz and pauli constructed a theory of a free massive spin-2 particle back in 1939 @xcite , in which the quadratic form of the action can be uniquely fixed as linearized general relativity ( gr ) with the fierz - pauli mass term , by imposing the tachyon - free and ghost - free conditions @xcite .",
    "however , it was discovered in 1970 that this linear massive spin-2 theory suffers from the van dam - veltman - zakharov ( vdvz ) discontinuity @xcite , with a massless limit that does not recover that of linearized general relativity . in particular ,",
    "the prediction of light - bending near massive objects was off by 25% and is therefore completely ruled out by observations .",
    "vainshtein mechanism _ was proposed in 1972 , in which a non - linear effect is introduced to force the massless limit to recover gr @xcite .",
    "however in the same year it was shown that the exact non - linearity introduced gives rise to the _ boulware - deser ghost _ or bd ghost for short @xcite , where the mass of the ghost mode is typically the same as that of the graviton , which means the ghost mode can not be ignored ( e.g. , by pushing to the planck scale to be delt with by a quantum theory of gravity @xcite ) since its mass is expected to be _ small_. the bd ghost is essentially due to an extra degree of freedom reinstated by the non - linearity , beyond the linearized 5 degrees of freedom .",
    "the interest in massive gravity was revived recently due to the construction of a presumably consistent non - linear massive gravity without the bd ghost @xcite .",
    "the absence of the bd ghost was checked at low order perturbative analysis level in the metric perturbation approach @xcite , and subsequently even at fully non - linear orders @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as pointed out in @xcite , wess - zumino already constructed a theory without the 6th degree of freedom and thus free of the bd ghost in 1970 @xcite .",
    "however , it should be pointed out this is a realization by hindsight : wess - zumino had simply presented a number of massive gravity models the linear fierz - pauli theory , without calculating the number of degrees of freedom , and without considering the issue of ghosts",
    ". we shall henceforth refer to such presumably consistent theories as non - linear massive gravity in general . in non - linear massive gravity , in addition to the dynamical metric @xmath0 ,",
    "there is also fixed background with non - dynamical metric @xmath1 , also known as the _ fiducial metric_.    recently , the characteristic equations of a special case of non - linear massive gravity , essentially one of the original model of wess - zumino with 5 degrees of freedom , were analyzed by deser and waldron @xcite ( see also the newer work @xcite ) . it was argued that the model admits superluminal shock wave solutions and therefore is acausal , and in addition , the superluminal shocks are only absent in the special case where the contortion term vanishes .",
    "furthermore , ironically this originates from the very constraint that removes the bd ghost . in the same work",
    ", it is mentioned that this fatal problem arises in _ any _ choice of background .",
    "this is an intriguing claim , which if true , is a rather strong one .",
    "after all , we do know that at least some physics _ does _",
    "depend on the choice of background .",
    "for example , a flrw ( friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ) background does not admit the flat or closed cosmology @xcite , however more general fiducial metrics do allow flrw universes of all signs of spatial curvature @xcite .",
    "motivated by the interesting work of ref.@xcite , we perform a careful analysis of the characteristic equations to further understand the causal structure of non - linear massive gravity .    in section [ section2 ]",
    ", we introduce the necessary set - up . section [ section3 ]",
    "contains the main analysis of the characteristic equations , while section [ section4 ] gives a concrete example to show a well - posed cauchy problem in the theory .",
    "we conclude with a discussion on the existence of superluminal propagation in non - linear massive gravity in section [ section5 ] .",
    "the method of characteristic employed in our work is reviewed in detail in [ app ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in non - linear massive gravity , we need to first choose and fix a background with a non - dynamical reference metric @xmath1 , in addition to the physical metric @xmath0 . for convenience of our analysis",
    ", we will work in the tetrad formalism @xcite , following the work of ref.@xcite .",
    "we denote the background tetrad by @xmath2 , and the dynamical tetrad by @xmath3 . here",
    "greek letters correspond to spacetime indices , while latin letters label tetrad vectors .",
    "the theory is also referred to as the two - metric `` @xmath4-@xmath5 '' theory in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , since there is a risk of confusion with bimetric theory , in which both metrics are dynamical , we will refer to this model as the _ minimal ghost - free model _",
    "instead , since this is the simplest of the ghost - free models in the formulation of ref.@xcite .",
    "the levi - civita connection @xmath6 that corresponds to the dynamical tetrad is torsion - less .",
    "however , the same connection employed as the connection for the background tetrad has nonzero torsion in general .",
    "the difference of the two connections is the contortion tensor : @xmath7 the background metric @xmath1 and the dynamical metric @xmath0 are related to the background tetrad and the dynamical tetrad , respectively , by @xmath8 raising and lowering of the greek indices are performed via the dynamical metric , i.e. , @xmath9    the action of the non - linear massive gravity theory is defined as @xcite @xmath10 in the unit @xmath11 , where the @xmath12 s are constant parameters of the theory and the exact expressions of the @xmath13 s are @xmath14 here , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case where @xmath17 .",
    "the equation of motion can be obtained by the variation with respect to the dynamical tetrad @xmath3 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the einstein tensor . here , in order to have a simpler form of equation of motion , we have acted upon the expression obtained after taking variation with respect to @xmath3 by @xmath20 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath21 has all of the information of the dynamical tetrad @xmath3 , and thus we analyze the dynamics of @xmath21 instead of that of @xmath3 . from the antisymmetric components of eq.([eom ] ) , we find that @xmath21 is a symmetric tensor and thus has ten degrees of freedom .    equation ( [ eom ] ) includes not only dynamical equations but also five constraint equations , which we shall now derive .",
    "the first two terms in eq.([eom ] ) are divergence free , and thus , taking the divergence of eq.([eom ] ) gives four constraint equations @xcite :",
    "@xmath22 another constraint equation @xcite stems from the nontrivial combination of the trace of eq.([eom ] ) and eq.([vconst ] ) ; it is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the inverse of the background tetrad @xmath2 . from the symmetry of the indices of @xmath21",
    ", we can infer that the indices of @xmath26 , which is simply the inverse of @xmath21 , are also symmetric . in the combination ( [ sconst ] ) ,",
    "the terms involving second order derivatives of @xmath21 are canceled out , and it becomes a constraint equation . to sum up , the ten symmetric components of eq.([eom ] )",
    "include the five constraint equations given by eq.([vconst ] ) and eq.([sconst ] ) , and five dynamical components containing the second order derivatives of @xmath21 .",
    "suppose we have a hypersurface @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the unit normal vector to @xmath27 . here",
    ", we consider the case where @xmath28 is timelike .",
    "we use gaussian normal coordinate near the hypersurface @xmath27 , @xmath29 in eq.([eom ] ) , all second derivatives of @xmath21 are of the form @xmath30\\beta}$ ] where the bracket @xmath31 $ ] represents antisymmetrization , i.e. , @xmath32\\cdots}:= \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( t_{\\alpha \\cdots \\beta \\gamma\\cdots}-t_{\\alpha \\cdots \\gamma\\beta\\cdots}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] having in mind the cauchy - kovalevskaya theorem @xcite ( see appendix a for a detailed discussion ) , we shall introduce new variables @xmath33\\gamma}.\\label{defm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath34 is antisymmetric with respect to @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we naively expect that @xmath34 has 24 degrees of freedom .",
    "there are , however , 4 constraints for @xmath34 , namely , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "this fact can be deduced from the definition ( [ defm ] ) of @xmath34 .",
    "therefore the actual number of degrees of freedom of @xmath34 is only 20 . under 3 + 1",
    "decomposition of spacetime based on the metric ( [ metric ] ) , all non - vanishing components can be written as @xmath39 using the four constraints ( [ constm ] ) for @xmath34 , we can express three of @xmath40 and one of @xmath41 by the other @xmath34 s .",
    "thus , after careful comparison it can be deduced that @xmath42 , @xmath40 , @xmath43 and @xmath41 have three , six , three and eight degrees of freedom respectively .",
    "in addition to the four constraints ( [ constm ] ) , we can derive other relations among the @xmath34 s .",
    "they are : @xmath44    equations ( [ 0i0 ] ) , ( [ 0ij ] ) , ( [ 0ij0 ] ) and ( [ 0ijk ] ) can be regarded as the time - evolution equations for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath43 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "all coefficients of the terms with a @xmath47-derivative in these equations are obviously nonzero .",
    "therefore , the hypersurface @xmath27 is _ not _ a characteristic surface for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath43 and @xmath41 .",
    "now , in order for the time evolution to be well - defined and solvable , we need to find appropriate equations to fix the time derivatives of the ten variables : @xmath48 , @xmath42 and @xmath40 .",
    "we have the ten components of the equation of motion ( [ eom ] ) , and so , should expect that the time derivatives of these ten variables can be obtained from them .",
    "having introduced @xmath34 , all second order derivatives of @xmath21 in the equation of motion ( [ eom ] ) can be written in terms of the first order derivatives of @xmath34 .",
    "then , the equation of motion ( [ eom ] ) becomes @xmath49 where @xmath50}f^a_{~\\lambda},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the brackets @xmath51 denotes symmetrization , i.e. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a function of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "note that derivatives of the dynamical variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 do not appear in @xmath53 and that derivatives of @xmath56 are not dynamical but fixed variables because @xmath56 is the given background tetrad . the constraint equations ( [ vconst ] ) and ( [ sconst ] ) can be written without derivatives of the dynamical variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 as @xmath59}=0 ,   \\label{cons}\\\\ & & { \\cal b}:= { \\cal c}-{\\cal c}_{\\mu}\\bar g^{\\mu\\nu}{\\cal c}_{\\nu}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad = 4\\alpha_0 + 3 \\alpha_1",

    ", the notation @xmath83 and @xmath84 means they are not the values of @xmath55 and @xmath48 , but represent the `` ( finite ) difference '' of the fields in the @xmath47-direction .",
    "the term  difference \" is related to the @xmath85-derivative in the case when the derivative is well - defined . in the context of calculus of single variable @xmath86 ,",
    "the `` difference '' is the quantity @xmath87 , related to the derivative @xmath88 by the well - known definition @xmath89 .",
    "here we do not use the @xmath85-derivative but  difference \" because , in characteristic analysis , sometimes we consider shock waves on which derivatives are not well - defined ( see the discussion in [ app ] ) .",
    "in ref.@xcite , it was argued that , if the contortion does not vanish , an arbitrary hypersurface can be a characteristic hypersurface .",
    "if so , a generic solution always has acausal structure , and thus the theory is very problematic . with our characteristic equations",
    ", we revisit this problem .",
    "we first consider the simplest example with the minkowski background tetrad .",
    "suppose the dynamical tetrad completely coincides with the background tetrad , i.e. , @xmath90 , and let us examine the characteristic determinant corresponding to a flat spatial hypersurface .",
    "under this situation , the expressions of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath21 , @xmath91 , @xmath55 and @xmath92 become @xmath93 then the characteristic equations simplify significantly and reduce to @xmath94 the characteristic determinant of this system is obviously generically nonzero and its eigenvalues are of order @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which are finite constants .",
    "now we consider a tiny perturbation on minkowski space and consider the changes in the characteristic determinant .",
    "since the characteristic determinant on minkowski space is finite and nonzero , by continuity , with a sufficiently small perturbation the characteristic determinant must still be nonzero _ even if the contortion does not vanish_. this means that the hypersurface is _ not _ a characteristic hypersurface ( although for some values of the fields , the characteristic matrix could become zero and thus a superluminal mode could potentially arise .",
    "we comment on this further in section [ section5 ] ) .",
    "this is in conflict with the conclusion of ref.@xcite .",
    "there is thus a need to point out why our analysis gives a result that is different from that of ref.@xcite .    in our analysis",
    ", the first order derivative of @xmath48 joins in the characteristic equations , while in the analysis of ref.@xcite it does not .",
    "the reason why it does not appear in their analysis is that the authors assume all discontinuities across a shock surface only show up in the second order derivative of the dynamical metric .",
    "however , as we will show in appendix a , in the discussion of characteristic we should define the characteristic matrix such that every dynamical field appears in the general solutions .",
    "indeed , except for the contribution from @xmath97 , our result is otherwise consistent with that of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , since their characteristic matrix does not have the contribution from @xmath97 , its determinant always becomes zero .",
    "if we go back to the original viewpoint of the cauchy - kovalevskaya theorem and the discussion about shock waves , it is reasonable for @xmath97 to appear in characteristic matrix .",
    "this is further discussed in appendix a.",
    "we have carefully examined the characteristic equations of a special case of non - linear massive gravity and showed that cauchy problem can be well - posed , in the sense that not every hypersurface can be a characteristic hypersurface given a physical metric . in the viewpoint on the fixed fiducial metric , of course , on an arbitrary hypersurface there",
    "probably exists specific field values , i.e. , the specific physical metrics , which give vanishing characteristic determinant . in this sense ,",
    "any hypersurface potentially _ can _ be characteristic by tuning values of a physical metric .",
    "however , the situation here is a bit more subtle than the result in ref.@xcite , in which the authors argued that , any hypersurface can be characteristic on a given physical metric .",
    "the difference is due to the contribution of the first derivative term of @xmath48 , which should appear in the characteristic equation in view of the discussion in [ app ] .",
    "we emphasize again that our result does _ not _ guarantee that the theory is free of problems . indeed",
    ", we have merely shown that there exist good non - characteristic hypersurfaces , _ not _ the _ absence _ of superluminal characteristics .",
    "one should next examine the characteristic matrix carefully to determine if its determinant admits any real root , the presence of which would imply the existence of superluminal propagations .",
    "the existence of such real root will directly affect the discussion of causality .",
    "it reduces the cauchy region and is sometimes responsible for giving rise to acausality . in order to have a deeper understanding of the causal structure of the theory",
    ", we will need an elaborate inspection of the characteristics .",
    "we shall leave this issue for future work .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to emphasize that superluminality does _ not _ always imply acausality @xcite .",
    "in addition , one should check if occurrence of superluminal modes simply signal that the theory as an _ effective _ theory is breaking down , _  la _ ref.@xcite .",
    "it is probably a good guess that non - linear massive gravity does suffer from superluminal propagation in general and that this might result in acausality .",
    "indeed , we have seen tantalizing hints of superluminal propagation on the self - accelerating solution @xcite , and in fact , _ instantaneous _ propagation may arise in the full theory with all the @xmath12 s being nonzero @xcite . in particular , energy can probably be emitted with infinite speed on the self - accelerating background by the helicity-0 mode of the massive graviton .",
    "in addition to superluminal mode , non - linear massive gravity on the self - accelerating solution has the property that although it generically has 5 degrees of freedom @xcite , in the second order action on open flrw background , perturbative analysis only reveals two tensors degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "that is , the full theory has different number of degrees of freedom compared to some of the low order limits .",
    "this could be dangerous as the excitations of the extra degrees of freedom may be accompanied by anomalous characteristic , as discussed in the context of @xmath98 gravity @xcite and poincar gauge theory @xcite .",
    "solutions with such anomalous characteristic is inappropriate to describe our universe .",
    "furthermore non - linear instability has also been pointed out in the self - accelerating solution @xcite .",
    "there remain a few puzzles to be resolved .",
    "firstly , a further careful analysis is required to check if non - linear massive gravity with @xmath99 does admit superluminal propagation as argued in ref.@xcite , which might well be the case .",
    "secondly , it would be interesting to investigate how the superluminal helicity-0 mode arises in the full theory and its corresponding characteristic analysis . solving them",
    ", we can assess the appropriateness of each solution , and it might give us further constraints on the theory .",

    "the analysis of the characteristic is related to the cauchy - kovalevskaya theorem , from which the propagation of shock - wave front can be obtained .",
    "our discussion here is based on the equations that appear in the usual proof of the cauchy - kovalevskaya theorem ( see , e.g. , the seminal work of courant and hilbert @xcite ) .",
    "since the naive extension of the result in the case involving only a single field to that of a multi - field case is invalid , we re - visit the original arguments used in the proof of the cauchy - kovalevskaya theorem and derive the exact characteristic equations in the multi - field case .",
    "suppose we have an @xmath100-th order differential equation which is quasilinear for the @xmath100-th order derivative terms , i.e. @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a field and @xmath103 and @xmath104 are functions of @xmath105 and derivatives of @xmath102 up to the @xmath106-th order .",

    "however , if the hypersurface @xmath109 is characteristic , @xmath114 can not be fixed uniquely , which allows a discontinuity in @xmath114 and thus non - unique time evolution of @xmath110 .    in order to make the discussion in the next subsection clearer , we comment here",
    "that , in the usual proof of cauchy - kovalevskaya theorem @xcite , a quasilinear @xmath100-th order differential equation for single field @xmath102 is reduced to a system of quasilinear first order differential equations for the multi - field @xmath117 , where @xmath118 and @xmath117 includes all partial derivatives of @xmath102 up to the @xmath106-th order .",
    "let @xmath119 denote the number of components of @xmath117 .",
    "then , eq.([single ] ) can be exactly represented by @xmath120\\partial_t { \\bf u } = b^i \\left[{\\bf u } , x \\right]\\partial_i { \\bf u } + b \\left[{\\bf u } , x \\right ] ,   \\label{b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 $ ] , @xmath122 $ ] and @xmath123 $ ] depend on @xmath117 and @xmath124 .",
    "the first two are @xmath125 matrices and the last one is a @xmath119-vector .",
    "time evolution of every component in @xmath117 can be obtained if @xmath126 .",
    "while most of the eigenvalues of @xmath121 $ ] are always nonzero , the only nontrivial eigenvalue is the same as @xmath127 in eq.([single ] ) . in the proof of the cauchy - kovalevskaya theorem , after transforming into eq.([singleu ] ) , the uniqueness is proved under the condition @xmath126 ( of course we also need the analyticity condition ) .    to conclude , in the cauchy - kovalevskaya theorem and in the discussion of shock waves , the only important term is @xmath127 .",
    "if @xmath128 , it is outside the range of applicability of the cauchy - kovalevskaya theorem to ensure a well - posed cauchy problem , and a shock wave can indeed propagate on the characteristic hypersurface .      here",
    ", we extend the discussion in the previous subsection to a multi - field case .",
    "while this can sometimes be extended straightforwardly , it is in general , quite nontrivial .",
    "we will give examples of both cases in this subsection .",
    "we consider equations for two fields @xmath102 and @xmath129 , @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are all functions of @xmath133 , @xmath102 , @xmath134 , @xmath129 and @xmath124 .",
    "picking up the higher order derivative terms with respect to @xmath135 , we have @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 mean they are not the values of @xmath102 and @xmath129 , but represent the  difference \" of the fields in the @xmath135-direction . if @xmath139 , we can not derive one of the linear combinations of @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and the hypersurface is a characteristic hypersurface , according to the discussion in the previous subsection .      here",
    ", we consider the equations for two fields @xmath140 and @xmath141 , @xmath142 where @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 are all functions of @xmath147 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath124 . actually , the equations in the non - linear massive gravity theory are very similar to these equations . to obtain the second order differential equation , we operate with @xmath148 on eq.([l ] ) and",
    "obtain @xmath149 if we naively pick up the higher - order derivative terms , the characteristic equations are @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 mean they are not the values of @xmath140 and @xmath141 , but represent the  difference \" of the fields in the @xmath135-direction .",
    "then , @xmath153 is trivially zero",
    ". does it mean that every hypersuface is a characteristic hypersurface ?    in order to investigate this question , first we consider a simple example @xmath154 where @xmath155 is a function of @xmath147 and @xmath140 , while @xmath156 is a non - zero constant .",
    "then , eq.([l ] ) can be regarded as a constraint equation for fixing the auxiliary field @xmath141 and we can solve it for @xmath141 . substituting the solution into eq.([ij ] ) , we can obtain an equation for @xmath140 : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is a function of @xmath147 , @xmath140 and @xmath124 .",
    "now , eq.([zeta ] ) is the equation for the single field @xmath140 and the charactaristic equation for @xmath140 is obviously @xmath159 which is different from eq.([barn1 ] ) . from the discussion in the previous subsection",
    ", @xmath140 is uniquely fixed in the neighborhood if @xmath160 and then , @xmath141 can be also determined uniquely from eqs.([l ] ) and ( [ q ] ) .",
    "therefore , we find that eq.([qi ] ) is the exact characteristic equation instead of eq.([barn1 ] ) .",
    "how do we derive the characteristic equation in a general multi - field case ?",
    "going back to eqs.([ij ] ) and ( [ l ] ) , it can be seen that in both equations , the order of derivative operators of @xmath141 are one less than those of @xmath140 .",
    "this means that discontinuity of @xmath161 can be balanced with that of @xmath162",
    ". therefore , not only the second order derivative of @xmath140 but also the _ first _ order derivative of @xmath141 should appear in the characteristic equation .",
    "then , the characteristic equation can be written as @xmath163 and the condition of the characteristic is consistent with eq.([qi ] ) .",
    "this statement can be justified further by writing the equations in the form of eq.([b ] ) .",
    "let us introduce new variables @xmath164 which are related by the commutativity of partial derivatives : @xmath165 eqs.([ij ] ) and ( [ pl ] ) can be represented by @xmath166 where all coefficients @xmath143 , @xmath167 , @xmath145 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 are written in non - derivative variables @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 . the combination of eqs.([u])([chara2 ] ) is exactly of the form of eq.([b ] ) .",
    "we can then apply the cauchy - kovalevskaya theorem and also have the same discussion about shock waves .",
    "again , we can deduce that @xmath174 is the condition for the hypersurface to be the characteristic hypersurface .",
    "finally , we discuss in brief the method for deriving characteristic equations with general multi - fields .",
    "we start by choosing one of the fields and define the dimension of it as zero .",
    "the dimension , denoted by @xmath175 $ ] , of the differential operator is one , i.e. @xmath176=1 $ ] .",
    "we determine the dimensions of other fields such that each field necessarily appears in one of the characteristic equations . in the case of eqs.([ij ] ) and ( [ l ] ) , for instance , we define the dimension of @xmath140 as zero .",
    "if the dimension of @xmath141 is larger than one , only @xmath177 can appear in the characteristic equations .",
    "on the other hand , if the dimension of @xmath141 is smaller than one , only @xmath178 can appear in the characteristic equations .",
    "therefore , only in the case where the dimension of @xmath141 is equal to one , both can appear in the characteristic equations , in which case we have the situation discussed above .",
