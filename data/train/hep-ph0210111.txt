    "= ?    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the experimental data on atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite show , in the muon - type events , a clear deficit which can not be accounted for without invoking non - standard neutrino physics .",
    "in addition to this , the recent results from the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) on neutral current ( nc ) events  @xcite have added more weight to the already robust evidence that an extension of the standard model of particle physics is necessary in the leptonic sector .",
    "altogether , the most popular explanation of both the solar and the atmospheric neutrino problem is provided by the neutrino oscillation hypothesis .",
    "however , many alternative attempts to account for neutrino anomalies without oscillations have recently been proposed  @xcite .",
    "while the results of solar neutrino experiments still admit very good alternative explanations  @xcite , the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is so well reproduced by the @xmath7 oscillation hypothesis  @xcite that one can use the robustness of this interpretation to place stringent limits on a number of alternative mechanisms  @xcite .    in the present work we present an updated analysis of the solar and atmospheric neutrino data , first in the context of the standard oscillation hypothesis ( secs .",
    "[ sec : solar ] and [ sec : atmos ] ) , and then assuming that neutrino posses also non - standard interactions with matter ( sec .",
    "[ sec : nsnmi ] ) .",
    "motivated by the stringent limits from reactor experiments  @xcite , we adopt an effective two - neutrino approach in which solar and atmospheric analyses decouple . however , in the pure - oscillation case presented in secs .",
    "[ sec : solar ] and [ sec : atmos ] our effective two - neutrino oscillation approach is generalized in the sense that it takes into account that a light sterile neutrino , advocated to account for the lsnd anomaly  @xcite , may participate in the conversion process  @xcite .",
    "the natural setting for such a light sterile neutrino is provided by four - neutrino models . in this paper",
    "we will determine the constraints on the oscillation parameters in this generalized scenario following from solar and atmospheric data _ separately _ , addressing the reader to our recent papers in refs .",
    "@xcite for a mass - scheme - dependent combined analysis of all current oscillation data .",
    "in the following we analyze solar neutrino data in the general framework of mixed active - sterile neutrino oscillations . in this case the electron neutrino produced in the sun converts into a combination of an active non - electron neutrino @xmath8 ( which again is a combination of @xmath1 and @xmath9 ) and a sterile neutrino @xmath10 : @xmath11 the parameter @xmath12 with @xmath13 describes the fraction of the sterile neutrino participating in the solar oscillations .",
    "therefore , the oscillation probabilities depend on the three parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath12 .    as experimental data",
    ", we use the solar neutrino rates of the chlorine experiment homestake  @xcite , the most recent result of the gallium experiments sage  @xcite and gallex / gno  @xcite , as well as the 1496-days super - kamiokande data sample  @xcite in the form of 44 bins and the latest results from sno presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the form of 34 data bins .",
    "therefore , we have a total of @xmath16 observables , which we fit in terms of the three parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath12 . further details about our statistical analysis can be found in  @xcite .        we have performed a global fit of solar neutrino data , whose",
    "results are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : solar ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : solar ] .",
    "our global best fit point occurs in the lma region , for @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we obtain a @xmath20 , which for @xmath21 d.o.f",
    ".  leads to an excellent goodness of fit of 83% . from fig .",
    "[ fig : solar ] we can derive the @xmath4 bounds @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . note that maximal mixing @xmath25 is now ruled out , and that the upper bound on @xmath14 is rather solid even without the inclusion of reactor experiments  @xcite .    from tab .",
    "[ tab : solar ] we notice the strong discrimination against non - lma solutions implied by the present data : in the pure - active case we find @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 relative to the global best fit in the lma region .",
    "this shows that the first hints in favor of a globally preferred lma oscillation solution , which followed mainly from the flatness of the super - k spectra , have now become a robust result , thanks to the additional data to which sno has contributed significantly .",
    "note that especially sma and just - so@xmath30  are highly disfavored with respect to lma .    the inclusion of a sterile neutrino participating in the oscillation process is strongly disfavored by the solar data . from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : solar ] we first see how the preferred lma solution survives in the presence of a _ small _ sterile component characterized by @xmath12 .",
    "however , increasing @xmath12 leads to a clear deterioration of all the oscillation solutions .",
    "notice that there is a crossing between the lma and vac solutions , as a result of which the best pure - sterile description lies in the vacuum regime .",
    "however , in the global analysis sterile oscillations with @xmath31 are highly disfavored .",
    "we find a @xmath32-difference between pure - active and pure - sterile of @xmath33 in the lma region , which decreases to @xmath34 if we allow also for vac .",
    "this means that pure - sterile oscillations are ruled out at @xmath35 compared to the active case .    in summary",
    ", we have found that , as long as the admixture of sterile neutrinos is acceptably small , the lma is always the best of the oscillation solutions , establishing its robustness also in our generalized oscillation scheme .",
    "in our analysis of atmospheric data we make use of the hierarchy @xmath36 and neglect the solar mass splitting  @xcite .",
    "further , in order to comply with the strong constraints from reactor experiments  @xcite we completely decouple the electron neutrino from atmospheric oscillations  @xcite . in the following we consider a generalized oscillation scheme in which a light sterile neutrino takes part in the oscillations  @xcite .",
    "such a scenario requires two more parameters in addition to @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we use the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 already introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and defined in such a way that @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond to the fractions of @xmath1 and @xmath10 participating in oscillations with @xmath38 , respectively . hence , pure - active atmospheric oscillations are recovered in the limit @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , we also present a `` restricted '' analysis in which the @xmath1 is completely constrained to the atmospheric mass states , so that @xmath43 . in this limit",
    "the parameter @xmath40 has a similar interpretation as @xmath12 introduced in the solar case , and @xmath1 oscillates into a linear combination of @xmath9 and @xmath10 : @xmath45    for the atmospheric data analysis we use all the charged - current data from the super kamiokande  @xcite and macro  @xcite experiments .",
    "the super - kamiokande data include the @xmath46-like and @xmath47-like data samples of sub- and multi - gev contained events ( 10 bins in zenith angle ) , as well as the stopping ( 5 angular bins ) and through - going ( 10 angular bins ) up - going muon data events . from macro",
    "we use the through - going muon sample divided in 10 angular bins  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath48 observables , which we fit in terms of the four parameters @xmath38 , @xmath37 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "further details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results of our analysis are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : atmos ] .",
    "in contrast to the solar case , the atmospheric @xmath32 exhibits a beautiful quadratic behavior , reflecting the high quality of the fit and the robustness of the oscillation solution .",
    "the global best fit point occurs at @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and exhibits a small but non - vanishing sterile neutrino component .",
    "however , this effect is not statistically significant , since also the pure - active case with @xmath44 and @xmath43 gives an excellent fit : for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we have that the @xmath32-difference with respect to the best fit point is only @xmath55 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : atmos ] we can extract the @xmath4 allowed ranges : @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the standard two - neutrino oscillation parameters , while for @xmath40 and @xmath39 we have @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "so we see that atmospheric data essentially reject a sterile neutrino component , and strongly bound the @xmath1-content in atmospheric oscillations to be nearly maximal .",
    "note that if we impose the condition @xmath43 , the @xmath4 limit on the sterile neutrino fraction improves to @xmath60 .",
    "these limits on the sterile admixture are significantly stronger than obtained previously  @xcite , and play an important role in ruling out four - neutrino oscillation solutions in a combined global analysis of the lsnd anomaly  @xcite .",
    "in this section we still focus on atmospheric data , but instead of adding a sterile neutrino we now consider the possibility that neutrinos are massive and moreover possess non - standard interactions with matter  @xcite .",
    "this may be regarded as generic in a large class of theoretical models . for definiteness , in the following",
    "we assume that non - standard neutrino interactions occur only with the @xmath61-quark . also , as in sec .",
    "[ sec : atmos ] we completely decouple @xmath0 from atmospheric oscillations . in this case , the propagation of @xmath1 and @xmath9 inside the earth is governed by the hamiltonian : @xmath62 where the sign @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) holds for neutrinos ( anti - neutrinos ) , @xmath65 is the number density of the @xmath61-quark along the path @xmath66 of the neutrinos propagating in the earth , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are phenomenological quantities describing flavor - changing and non - universal non - standard interactions , respectively .",
    "therefore , as for the sterile neutrino case the transition mechanism depends on four independent parameters .",
    "note that without loss of generality we can restrict the range of the oscillation parameters to @xmath69 and @xmath70 , provided that we consider both positive and negative values of the nsi parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "the details of our analysis are the same as in the previous section .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsnmi ] .",
    "the global best fit point occurs at @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . as in the sterile neutrino case ,",
    "a small component of nsi is preferred , however the effect is not statistically significant : the best pure oscillation solution @xmath75 , which occurs at @xmath76 and @xmath77 , exhibits a @xmath32 which is worse than the global one only by 2.4 units .",
    "thus , the determination of the oscillation parameters @xmath38 and @xmath37 is stable under the perturbation introduced by the additional nsi mechanism , as can be seen also comparing the `` free '' and `` oscillations '' lines in the first two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : nsnmi ] .",
    "moreover , the @xmath32 function is quite flat in the @xmath68 directions for @xmath78 , and almost symmetric under the exchange @xmath79 .",
    "on the other hand , the pure nsi solution @xmath80 gives a very poor fit , and as already found in ref .",
    "@xcite it is completely ruled out .",
    "this occurs since the nsi mechanism is not able to reconcile the anomaly observed in the upgoing muon sample with that seen in the contained event sample .",
    "therefore , when combining the two mechanisms of @xmath7 transition , oscillations play the role of leading mechanism , while nsi s can only be present at a sub - dominant level .    from fig",
    ".  [ fig : nsnmi ] we also derive the @xmath4 allowed ranges : @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the oscillation parameters , while for the nsi parameters we have @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "this is the main result of our analysis , since it provides limits to non - standard neutrino interactions which are truly model independent , being obtained from pure neutrino - physics processes .",
    "in particular they do not rely on any relation between neutrinos and charged lepton interactions .",
    "therefore our bounds are totally complementary to what may be derived on the basis of conventional accelerator experiments  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have presented an updated analysis of solar and atmospheric data , both in the context of standard oscillation hypothesis ( generalized to account also for a light sterile neutrino ) , and assuming that neutrino posses also non - standard interactions with matter .",
    "we have found that both solar and atmospheric neutrino data are very well explained by the simplest hypothesis of oscillations into an active neutrino , and disfavor the inclusion of an extra sterile state .",
    "in fact , at the @xmath4 level the fraction of sterile neutrino involved in oscillations is limited to be less than @xmath2 in the solar sector and less than @xmath3 in the atmospheric sector .",
    "furthermore , atmospheric data also constrain non - standard neutrino interactions with matter , which are bounded to @xmath83 for the flavor - changing component and @xmath84 for the non - universal component .    in all the considered cases",
    "the determination of the oscillation parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 is stable under the inclusion of exotic physics , such as an extra sterile neutrino or non - standard neutrino - matter interactions .",
    "this fact is an evidence in favor of the three - neutrino oscillation solution to the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems . in particular , for what concerns the atmospheric anomaly we conclude that a maximum mixing angle is a solid result , which must be incorporated into any acceptable particle physics model , even in the presence of exotic neutrino interactions .",
