    "the determination of elemental abundances in metal - poor stars is a basic constraint for models of the chemical evolution of our galaxy , and provide wealth of data about the history of star formation ( see e.g. wheeler et al .",
    "a very important rle is played by c , n , o , na , mg , and fe , which are amongst the most abundant elements , likely produced in a variety of astronomical sites .",
    "the determination of accurate abundances for these elements in a large sample of stars of different metallicities , and their discussion within the framework of galactic evolution is the main purpose of the present series of papers . in the course of this investigation , we found it necessary to discuss a number of important , related issues in order to obtain more reliable results : some of them ( e.g. the solar abundances and the applicability of the adopted model atmospheres in abundance analyses ) were treated in a parallel study of the spectra of rr lyrae stars at minimum light ( clementini et al .",
    "1995 ) , and in more depth by castelli and gratton ( 1996 ) .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the presentation of the adopted atmospheric parameters ; these were obtained using an iterative procedure which exploits both photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "the most relevant feature is a new , hopefully improved calibration of colours against effective temperatures ( s ) . in other papers of this series ( and with the contribution of other authors ) we will present a discussion of non - lte effects , using specially devoted statistical equilibrium computations and a new empirical calibration of the collisional cross - sections , and a discussion of the adopted abundance indices and of the derived abundances within the framework of models of the galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the colour-  calibrations are by themselves a very interesting output of the present investigation : they have an important impact on a broad class of topics , including e.g. abundance analyses and comparisons between theoretical isochrones and cluster colour - magnitude ( c - m ) diagrams .",
    "our new  scale is close to that determined by king ( 1993 : hereinafter k93 ) ; it is based on empirical determinations for population  i stars , applying corrections for non - solar metallicities drawn from the same kurucz ( 1992 ) model atmospheres used in the analysis . a quite extensive discussion of this  scale is given in sect .  5 ; we conclude that it gives reliable and consistent results for @xmath4  k , while either the  scale or the same kurucz models seem inadequate for stars cooler than 4400  k.",
    "before discussing the derivation of the atmospheric parameters adopted in our analysis , a short presentation of the observational data used in this series of papers is required .",
    "the original material consists in about 400 high resolution ( @xmath5 ) , high @xmath6  ( @xmath7 ) spectra of 19 metal - poor stars acquired with the short camera of the coud echelle spectrograph ( ces ) at the eso coud auxiliary telescope , la silla , and with the coud spectrograph at the 2.7  m telescope of the mcdonald observatory .",
    "the stellar sample is the same used by gratton & sneden ( 1991 , 1994 : hereinafter gs1 and gs2 ) in order to derive abundances of fe - group and @xmath8rich elements .",
    "however , the initial observations were carried out during eso test time , kindly made available by dr s. dodorico : the available observing time forced us to concentrate on the brightest ( @xmath9 ) southern metal - poor stars accessible during the observing run .",
    "this sample included only 19 stars ; furthermore , all extremely metal - poor stars are giants , with the only exception of the subgiant hd  140283 .",
    "this sample is too small for the present purposes and important biases are present .",
    "for this reason , we decided to increase it by adding data ( equivalent widths @xmath10 ) from a number of literature sources , reanalyzing them in the most homogeneous way possible : these additional data allow to better understand the selection biases present in our data , and to obtain a sample large enough for a statistically significant analysis of the results .",
    "the additional sources of @xmath10s were selected from papers based on high resolution , high @xmath6  observational material ; we only considered studies giving @xmath10s for both fe  i and fe  ii lines , since we used the fe equilibrium of ionization to derive gravities : for this reason , only papers dealing with data having a rather large wavelength coverage were considered .",
    "the following works were then considered :    1 .",
    "tomkin et al .",
    "( 1992 : hereinafter tlls ) : analysis of high excitation c and o permitted lines in 34 unevolved metal - poor stars ; 2 .",
    "sneden et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and kraft et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ( hereinafter collectively skpl ) : abundances of o from forbidden lines and na from the doublet at 6154 - 60    in 27 field halo giants .",
    "3 .   edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 : hereinafter e93 ) : analysis of high excitation o , na , and mg lines in about 180 field dwarfs with metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath11 .",
    "their data were integrated with @xmath10s for high excitation c lines from clegg et al .",
    "( 1981 ) and tomkin et al ( 1995 ) , and forbidden o lines from nissen & edvardsson ( 1992 ) in a smaller number of stars .",
    "zhao & magain ( 1990 : hereinafter zm90 ) : abundances of na and mg in 20 metal - poor dwarfs .",
    "since there is some overlap amongst these different samples , on the whole , data for almost 300 stars over a wide range in luminosity and metal - abundance are considered . in the remainining part of this paper",
    ", we will discuss the derivation of the atmospheric parameters used in the analysis of all this material .",

    ") much better than the bell et al .",
    "( 1976 ; hereinafter begn ) atmospheres , they were adopted in the present analysis .",
    "we decided to revise the whole derivation of atmospheric parameters ( effective temperature , surface gravity @xmath26 , model metal abundance [ a / h ] , and microturbulent velocity ) for the program stars , in order to put them on a self - consistent scale .",
    "s were derived from dereddened colours using semiempirical calibrations obtained through a procedure similar to that of k93 ; however standard s obtained by means of the irfm ( blackwell & shallis 1977 ) were taken from blackwell & lynas - gray ( 1994 : hereinafter blg ) , who used new calibrations based on the k92 model atmospheres .",
    "furthermore , corrections for gravities were also obtained empirically by interpolating among values obtained for dwarfs and giants .",
    "the adopted iterative procedure ( which requires approximate initial values for @xmath27 , [ a / h ] , and ) is as follows :    1 .",
    "we first obtained empirical colour- s calibrations using a compilation of s derived with the irfm for @xmath28140 population i stars from the lists of blg and bell & gustafsson ( 1989 ) ; these last s were corrected to put them into the same scale of those of blg .",
    "a first correction is required because bell & gustafsson derived s from the irfm using the begn models rather than the k92 models used here ; we notice that on this respect , our calibrations represent an improvement over that of k93 , who used s derived from the irfm calibrated against begn models ( saxner & hammarbck 1985 ) .",
    "the s from bell & gustafsson were then lowered by 122  k to put them on the same scale of those by blg .",
    "this last correction might be due to the different ways fluxes in the ir are determined by interpolation within broad - band colours .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the colour-(irfm ) graphs .",
    "all colours are in the johnson system , except the strmgren colour index @xmath25 .",
    "the most appropriate colour indices can be deduced from the dispersion of the observational data ; as expected , the best index is @xmath24 , followed by @xmath25 .",
    "however , it should be noticed that sequences for dwarfs ( luminosity class v ; few stars of luminosity class iv are present in the sample ) and giants ( luminosity class iii ) are clearly separated . for any colour , we then fitted cubic polynomials ( = @xmath29 ) through the colour - planes for stars of luminosity class iii and v separately .",
    "polynomial coefficients are given in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "we derived s from each observed colour for the program stars using a cubic polynomial interpolation in the theoretical -colour planes .",
    "however , before doing this interpolation we transformed both theoretical s and observed colours , to consider the difference between the empirical and theoretical calibrations for population i stars , and the variation of colours with metallicity .",
    "this was done in two steps : ( i ) by assuming that the zero - point calibrations of the various theoretical colors may be in error and the irfm yields the right temperatures , we replaced s of the k92 models with those s that give the same value of the colours but using the empirical calibrations obtained from population i stars : this coordinate transformation corresponds to the application of systematic corrections , function of , to the k92 temperatures , equal to the differences between the empirical and theoretical calibrations for solar metallicities .",
    "( ii ) we then replaced the colours of k92 models for solar metallicity at each temperature , with the colours of k92 models for the approximate input value of the metallicity ; these colours were obtained by means of a cubic polynomial interpolation through theoretical colours given by k92 ; this second coordinate transformation corresponds to the application of systematic corrections , still a function of , to the observed colours to consider the individual metallicity of the star under consideration . note that this step implies that though the k92 models may give uncorrect colours at a given temperature , they correctly predict the dependence of colours on metal abundances . this last assumption was made also by k93 .",
    "we applied the previous transformations separately for both giants and dwarfs ; when comparing theoretical and empirical calibrations , we assumed @xmath304.5 for luminosity class v ; for luminosity class iii , we assumed @xmath302 for @xmath31  k , and @xmath32@xmath33 for @xmath34  k. these values approximately match the observed @xmath27  for dwarfs and giants respectively ; however , this assumption is not critical , since gravity corrections are generally small . the best temperature for each colour as function of gravity was then derived by linear interpolation / extrapolation between the values obtained for the two different logarithmic gravities , using the approximate input value for the stellar gravity .",
    "we then averaged temperatures obtained from each colour , assigning weight 4 to @xmath24 , 0.5 to @xmath21 , and 1 to all other colours ; these weights were attributed on the basis of the observed residuals about the fitting polynomials used for population i stars .",
    "we used this input temperature ( and the initial values of gravity , metal abundance and microturbulent velocity ) to iterate the abundance analysis until ( i ) we had no trend of the abundances derived from individual fe  i line with expected line strength ( varying ) ; ( ii ) the value of the model abundance was identical to the derived fe abundance ( varying [ a / h ] ) ; and ( iii ) the abundances derived from fe  i and fe  ii lines were the same ( varying @xmath27 ) .",
    "this abundance analysis was done using model atmospheres extracted from the grid of k92 .",
    "finally , we repeated the whole procedure of temperature derivation entering the new values of gravity , metal abundance , and microturbulent velocity obtained after the previous step , and iterated this procedure until we converged to a consistent set of atmospheric parameters .",
    "no iteration was usually required when @xmath24  colours were available , since they are only weakly dependent on gravity and metallicity ; one or two iterations were required for the other cases .",
    "for all program stars , new values for the atmospheric parameters were derived , following the iterative procedure described in sect .",
    "3 . we used the @xmath10s from the various sources cited in sect .  2 , and photometric data from hauck & mermilliod ( 1990 ) , schuster & nissen ( 1988 ) , twarog & anthony - twarog ( 1994 ) , laird et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , stone ( 1983 ) , pilachowski ( 1978 ) , arribas & martinez - roger ( 1987 ) , and alonso et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ; however , only @xmath25  colours were used for e93 s stars , and @xmath25  and @xmath24  colours for zm s stars .",
    "reddenings for stars considered in gs1 and gs2 were taken from these papers ; those for the skpl giants were taken from twarog & anthony - twarog ( 1994 ) , while no reddening was assumed for the dwarfs observed by tlls , e93 , and zm90 .",
    "since @xmath10s for very few lines of fe  i were usually available from the studies of tlls and skpl , s were obtained using a mean relation drawn from our program stars ( = @xmath35  ) , except for a few cases ( generally very cool stars ) in which obvious trends with line strength were present ; based on the dispersion along this mean relation , we estimate that errors of this s are @xmath36  . for the warmer stars considered by e93",
    ", a dependence on  must be included .",
    "we find that a good representation is given by the relation ( = @xmath37@xmath38  ) .",
    "we also revised the fe  i @xmath39 s , to put them in a scale consistent with that adopted in this paper ( see carretta et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the derived atmospheric parameters are listed in tables  2 - 6 ( available in electronic form ) .",
    "after the draft of this paper was ready , we were aware that the convective flux in atlas 9 version used to compute the 1992 models stored on the cd - rom 13 generated discontinuities in the grids of the colour indices for in the approximate range between 6700  k ( for @xmath40 ) to 8000  k ( for @xmath41 ) .",
    "the convection formalism was improved ( castelli , 1996 ) and kurucz ( 1995 ) recomputed most of the cool model atmospheres ( k95 models ) .",
    "the 1995 models differ from the 1992 models mostly for an improved convection , for the larger number of layers ( 72 rather than 64 ) which extend toward lower optical depths , for a better treatment of the radiation emerging from the uppermost layers , and for a few changes in some opacity routines , as that for h@xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , all the colours are recalibrated on a different atlas9 vega model ( castelli & kurucz 1994 ) . rather than redoing all our lengthy computations ,",
    "we directly compared colour indices and abundances from the k92 and k95 models , made recently available to us by r. kurucz .",
    "first we considered colors , and in particular johnson @xmath18  and @xmath24 , and strmgren @xmath25  ( these are the colors having the largest weight in our  determinations ) .",
    "we found small constant offsets of 0.004 , 0.012 and 0.025 for @xmath25 , @xmath18 , and @xmath24respectively between the original k92 colors and those we obtained using k95 models ( in the sense that k95 colors are redder ) .",
    "these small offsets are due to slightly different assumptions about the atmospheric parameters for the reference star vega . for the stars used in this series of papers ,",
    "the theoretical -scale obtained using k95 models is @xmath43  k warmer .",
    "for all colors , there is a peak in the color residuals ( amounting to @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46  for @xmath25 , @xmath18 , and @xmath24  respectively , again k95 colors being redder ) over a small range of  ( @xmath47  for @xmath48 , and @xmath49  k for @xmath50 ) . the peak residual is smaller for metal - poor model atmospheres .",
    "given the small  range where these larger corrections ( corresponding to 30 - 120  k , depending on the colour used ) apply , they have negligible impact on the polynomial fitting curves used in our semiempirical procedure .",
    "furthermore , the peaks fall outside the range for stars considered in this series ( and in the parallel paper on rr lyrae at minimum light by clementini et al . 1995 ) .",
    "we then compared abundances obtained using k92 and k95 model atmospheres for a few typical cases , adopting in both cases the same set of atmospheric parameters .",
    "we found that k95 atmospheres yield larger abundances ( by 0.008 dex ) than k92 atmospheres for low excitation lines of easily ionized elements ; and smaller abundances ( by 0.003 dex ) for high excitation lines of dominant species ( like the oi ir triplet ) .    on the whole , we regard differences between results obtained using k92 and k95 model atmospheres as negligible with respect to other sources of error in our analysis , and in this series of papers we will keep the results obtained using k92 atmospheres .",
    "use of k92 atmospheres and of the new sets of atmospheric parameters allows an homogeneous comparison to solar abundances ; however , we noticed some inconsistencies , that are discussed in this section .",
    "dalle ore ( 1992 ) found a systematic trends of abundances from individual fe  i lines with excitation potential for metal - poor giants , in the sense that temperature derived from line excitation is much lower than that derived from colours ( that is , a negative slope @xmath51  of fe abundances with excitation potential ) .",
    "we found a similar trend using star in our original sample , that admittedly included a few stars ; however the large spectral coverage allowed derivation of @xmath10s for a large set of lines having accurate laboratory @xmath39 s .",
    "we found the following average values for the slope @xmath51  in the excitation - abundance plane :    * all stars : @xmath52  dex / ev ( @xmath53  dex / ev , 19 stars ) * @xmath54 : @xmath55  dex / ev ( @xmath56  dex / ev , 6 stars ) * @xmath57 : @xmath58  dex / ev ( @xmath59  dex / ev , 6 stars ) * @xmath60 : @xmath61  dex / ev ( @xmath62  dex / ev , 7 stars )    on the whole , the value of the slope seems to be weakly dependent on surface gravity , while the scatter seems to be a function of gravity .",
    "this suggests that either the effective temperatures of giants are ill - defined ( e.g. due to errors in the estimate of reddening ) , or that the atmospheres of giants are somewhat different one from the other , or both . on the other side ,",
    "the average slope for stars in the large sample by e93 ( all with @xmath63 ) is quite different ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , 203 independent estimates for 187 stars ) ; a clear trend with overall metal abundance is present : @xmath66}+(0.040\\pm 0.021)$ ] .",
    "however , the determinations of the slope using stars in the e93 sample are based on a few lines with solar oscillator strengths .",
    "contamination by blending features may cause spurious trends .",
    "this point should then be reexamined using an extended line list for a large sample of stars .      for another program (",
    "carretta & gratton 1996 ) , we applied this same procedure to the analysis of the spectra of globular cluster giants , where gravities can be determined from luminosities , masses and effective temperatures .",
    "that analysis showed that the difference between abundances given by neutral and singly ionized lines is a function of .",
    "this is illustrated by the data in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , where we plotted the differences between the gravities for globular cluster giants obtained from the procedure described in this paper , and those derived from the position in the c - m diagram , assuming a mass of 0.8  @xmath67 .",
    "while the agreement between the two sets of gravities is fairly good for @xmath4  k , gravities derived from the fe equilibrium of ionization are on average too low for stars cooler than 4400  k.    in the following we will consider three possible explanations for this discrepancy :    1 .   the irfm can not be reliably used for m - stars from ground - based observations alone , due to the strong molecular bands in the near - ir spectral region .",
    "it is then possible that our empirical calibration for population i stars , based on the application of the irfm method to ground - based observations , is not accurate for the coolest stars . on the other side , s for m giants",
    "can be derived from determinations of stellar angular diameters .",
    "we then tested the cool end of our -colour calibrations by comparing the s derived using the irfm with those that can be obtained from interferometric determinations of stellar diameters ( di benedetto & rabbia , 1987 : see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "we found however an excellent agreement between the two sets of s ; a calibration obtained by merging the two sets differs by @xmath68  k from that obtained using s from the irfm alone for @xmath69  k. 2 .   some fe overionization",
    "is expected for the coolest , very low gravity giants .",
    "we performed an explorative statistical equilibrium computation for the coolest star in our own sample ( hd  187111 ) using multi code ( scharmer & carlsson , 1985 ; carlsson 1986 ) and a 60-level fe  i model atom ( for a full description of this model atom and the methods used in this and other statistical equilibrium computations , see gratton et al .",
    "we parametrized the poorly known cross sections for collisions with h  i atoms by matching observations of rr lyrae at minimum light ( see clementini et al .",
    "we found that the maximum non - lte correction to the fe  i abundance in hd  187111 compatible with the observations of rr lyrae variables ( where departures from lte are expected to be larger than in the program stars ) is 0.08  dex ( abundances from fe  ii lines are not influenced by departures from lte ) . a smaller correction ( 0.04  dex )",
    "is expected for hd  136316 , while non - lte corrections to fe abundances should be very small for the other program stars .",
    "if lte abundances from fe  i lines for hd  187111 are corrected for this amount , we derive slightly larger surface gravities ( @xmath70  dex ) .",
    "this correction is about half the value required to reduce the luminosity of this metal - poor star below that expected at the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "hence , departures from lte are a promising candidate to explain part of the observed discrepancy .",
    "we finally tested the hypothesis that the model atmospheres may be responsible for the observed discrepancies .",
    "this was done by replacing begn models to the k92 ones for a few typical cases .",
    "abundances for the sun derived from the k92 models and updated laboratory @xmath39 s are close to those given by the holweger & muller ( 1974 ) model , and to the meteoritic values ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , while it is well known that abundances provided by begn solar model are too low by @xmath71  dex ( the exact value depends on the line list used ) .",
    "furthermore , k92 model reproduces the solar flux distribution much better than the begn model ; hence k92 models should be preferred in the analysis of solar type stars .",
    "however , for all the species investigated , the k92 and begn models yield stellar abundances relative to the solar ones which differ less than 0.03 dex for @xmath0  k. when doing a relative analysis for cooler stars , the ionization equilibrium given by begn model atmospheres is in better agreement with that obtained using s from irfm and gravities from the c - m diagram , although the discrepancy is not completely canceled .",
    "gravities obtained from the equilibrium of ionization are too low when using k92 models for these cool stars .",

    "figures  [ fig:4 ] and  [ fig:5 ] compare the present empirical -colour calibrations for population i dwarfs and giants respectively with the theoretical calibrations directly based on k92 fluxes for the johnson @xmath18 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24  colours , and for the strmgren @xmath25  index .",

    ", the metallicity dependence is different in the two cases , since we are using the k92 models .",
    "furthermore , the gravity dependence at low s and metallicity seems not negligible ; however , it is now clear that k92 models are not fully adequate in the analysis of the coolest , very metal - poor giants .",

[ fig:12 ] : the agreement is excellent , but the range of validity of the blg scale is smaller than the present scale .        more intriguing",
    "is the situation for metal - poor dwarfs .",
    "the present scale agrees fairly well with that of k93 , as shown by the comparisons of fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] ; this is not surprising , since they were derived using the same model atmospheres and a similar procedure .",
    "recently , e93 published the results of the analysis of a very extensive spectroscopic survey of field dwarfs .",
    "all stars considered by e93 have [ fe / h]@xmath11 ; however , nissen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) presented the results of the analysis of a few more metal - poor dwarfs whose atmospheric parameters were derived with a similar technique .",
    "a star - to - star comparison between our and e93 and nissen et al . sets of atmospheric parameters shows large discrepancies in the adopted s for a few stars .",
    "this effect is systematic , as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] , which displays the difference between the s derived by the two techniques for the stars observed by e93 and nissen et al . against [ fe / h ] .",
    "the best fit regression line with [ fe / h ] is : @xmath76}-(81\\pm 30),\\ ] ] based on 187 stars .",
    "the persson linear regression coefficient is @xmath77 , but there are minor , not negligible correlations with gravity and ; the regression using all three variables is : @xmath78}-(45\\pm 14)\\log g \\\\ ~                  & ~&- ( 0.0492\\pm 0.0074 ) t_{\\rm eff}+(405\\pm 27),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath79 , a marginal but significative improvement .",
    "this comparison shows that s may be different by as much as @xmath80  k for the most metal - poor stars , even though the same colours are used ; this is an enormous difference causing discrepancies as large as @xmath81  dex in the derived [ fe / h ] .",
    "a small part of this discrepancy can be attributed to the rather large values of reddening @xmath82  adopted by nissen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and for individual stars there are colour indices yielding slightly different s using our prescriptions .",
    "however most of this discrepancy is real , and at _ prima facie _ surprising , since both  scales are linked to accurately determined s for population i stars , for which a good agreement exists among determinations by different authors .",
    "however , a major difference is the use of different grids of model atmospheres : e93 and nissen et al . used the new ( unpublished ) osmarcs model atmospheres , while we used the k92 ones .",
    "even though these two sets of atmospheric models use very similar line opacities , they differ in the treatment of convection , since k92 models include some overshooting , which is not present in osmarcs atmospheres .",
    "this causes different @xmath83  relations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:15 ] for both the sun and a metal - poor dwarf atmospheres ; the k92 models have a bump at @xmath84 , which is not present in osmarcs models . in metal - rich atmospheres ,",
    "this bump is at rather large optical depths , and it does not affect significantly the stellar colours . instead , the bump is at shallower optical depths in the more transparent atmospheres of metal - poor stars ; the consequence is that the two models predict a very different dependence of colours on metal abundance : e.g. at @xmath85 , osmarcs models with [ fe / h]=0 are @xmath86  k warmer than models with [ fe / h]=@xmath87 , while the analogous difference for the k92 models is only @xmath88  k. the discrepancy between the two grids is smaller for low  stars , but these are not included in the e93 and nissen et al . papers .",
    "the most sensitive test for model atmospheres is the comparison between predicted and observed solar limb - darkening relations .",
    "blackwell , lynas - gray and smith ( 1995 ) show that this comparison clearly favors the k92 model atmospheres with respect to the osmarcs ones ; similar results were also obtained indipendently by castelli and gratton ( 1996 ) and edvardsson ( private communication ) .",
    "this fact suggests that at least in the solar atmosphere convection transports energy more efficiently around unity optical depth than the mixing - length theory predicts .",
    "this may be a consequence of neglecting the inhomogeneities observed in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the larger freedom given by the addition of a new parameter ( related to overshooting ) allows a better representation of the temperature structure of the solar atmosphere in k92 models . since it is not entirely clear that this also applies to atmospheres different from that of the sun ( see e.g. castelli and gratton 1996 ) , in the next two subsections we will further investigate the consistency of the present scale , by comparing our s with those obtained by directly using the irfm for metal - poor dwarfs , and the model predictions with observed profiles of the balmer lines .",
    "we found a good internal consistency in results obtained with the k92 models .",
    "magain ( 1987 ) derived s for eleven metal - poor dwarfs using the irfm and the begn model atmospheres ; it must however be noticed that his s derived from @xmath89  and @xmath90  magnitudes are quite different ( those derived from @xmath89  being lower by @xmath91  k on average ) .",
    "his -scale is lower than ours by @xmath92  k , with no trend with metal abundance ; this difference is equal to the difference between the -scale of magain and that of saxner & hammarbck ( 1985 ) at [ fe / h]@xmath93 , the lower edge of validity of this last scale ( see also k93 ) . however , to make a meaningful comparison , magain s s should be corrected for the systematic differences between s derived using the irfm with begn and k92 model atmospheres .",
    "these have been computed only for population  i stars ( blg ; mgessier 1994 ) ; if these corrections are applied , magain s s are increased by 90  k on average ( the correction is rather large for s derived from @xmath89  magnitudes , while it is quite small for those obtained from @xmath90 ) . the mean difference with the current -scale",
    "is then reduced to @xmath94  k. furthermore , s derived from @xmath89  and @xmath90  magnitudes would now be in fair agreement with each other , the mean difference being reduced to @xmath95  k. this test should be repeated with values for the @xmath96  ratio of the irfm appropriate for metal - poor stars : however , these early results suggest that the dependence of colours on metal abundance given by k92 models should not be far from correct .      lcccccc star & @xmath97&@xmath98fe / h@xmath99_{\\rm sn}$]&(@xmath24)&(h@xmath100 ) +   + hd  19445 & 1.37   & -1.91 & 6112 & 6250 + hd  64090 & 1.72   & -1.69 & 5510 & 5500 + hd114762 & 1.41   & -0.87 & 5964 & 5750 + hd194598 & 1.35   & -1.11 & 6077 & 6100 + hd201891 & 1.39   & -1.08 & 6009 & 6000 + ltt10733 & 1.525 & -1.04 & 5788 & 5900 + ltt11819 & 1.79   & -1.56 & 5406 & 5400",
    "+   +   +    while the far wings of h@xmath100  are quite independent from gravity , metallicity and convection of the model atmospheres ( and are then good temperature indicators for solar type stars ) , those of the other balmer lines are strongly dependent on how convection is handled when computing model atmospheres , due to its effect on the temperature stratification of the model .",
    "fuhrmann et al .",

    "a comparison with the solar flux spectrum ( kurucz et al . 1984 ) showed that our computed profiles with the k92 model atmospheres reproduce observations very well ( incidentally , good agreement is also obtained when using the osmarcs and holweger & mller , 1974 , atmospheres ) .",

    "the most important aspect of this derivation is the determination of a new  scale , based on the k92 model atmospheres .",
    "our  scale is based on s determined empirically using the irfm for about 140 population i stars .",
    "we considered separately dwarfs and giants , so that s for stars of any gravity can be derived by interpolation / extrapolations .",
    "cubic polynomials drawn through the observational points allows to correct theoretical s from the k92 models : s appropriate for any star can then be obtained by an iterative procedure by using the theoretical dependence of colours on metal abundance , once abundance determined from the line analysis and gravities given by fe equilibrium of ionization are known .",
    "a discussion of our  scale shows that it gives consistent results for stars with @xmath31  k , while gravities determined from the equilibrium of ionization for fe are too low for giants cooler than this limit .",
    "we discuss several possible causes of this discrepancy : we found that departures from lte may explain part of it .",

    "we found excellent agreement with other  scales based on the k92 model atmospheres ( in particular , the agreement is good with k93 s ) , while there is a serious discrepancy with the s determined for metal - poor dwarfs using the new osmarcs models .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to the different way convection is handled in the two set of models .",
    "k92 model atmospheres better reproduces the solar limb darkening than the osmarcs models .",
