    "the recognition that outbursts seen in soft x - ray transients ( sxts , where the compact star is a neutron star or black hole ) show similarities to those seen in the unstable class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs , where the compact star is a white dwarf ) started with the discovery of the brightest x - ray transient so far , i.e. , a0620@xmath100 ( elvis et al .  1975 ) .",
    "the detection at other wavelengths followed soon thereafter ( for a review see kuulkers 1998 ) .",
    "analysis of archival plates showed another outburst which occurred @xmath260  years earlier , in 1917 ( eachus et al .",
    "the large optical outburst amplitude ( @xmath28  mag ) and long recurrence time were found to be comparable to those of recurrent novae , including the dwarf novae ( dne ) wzsge , alcom and vyaqr ( e.g. , eachus et al .",
    "1976 ; kholopov &  efremov 1976 ) .",
    "based on the luminosity of a0620@xmath100 in x - rays it was suggested that the compact star in this system was a neutron star or black hole ( e.g. , elvis et al .   1975 ) .",
    "ten years later it was dynamically established to be a black hole ( mcclintock &  remillard 1986 ) .",
    "mainly the availability of all - sky x - ray monitors increased the sample of x - ray transients with well covered outburst light curves ( e.g. , white et al .",
    "1984 ; for a recent compendium of sxts light curves i refer to chen et al .",
    "it was noticed by van paradijs &  verbunt ( 1984 ) , through a comparison of a sample of sxts and dne , that they had comparable rise times to maximum , and that , therefore , the nature of their outbursts may be similar .",
    "the optical outburst amplitudes of sxts range from 2 to 9  mag ( e.g. , shahbaz &  kuulkers 1998 ) , a range also seen in dne ( e.g. , warner 1995 ) .",
    "to date , various other characteristics of dwarf novae outbursts are also found in sxts , strengthening their similarity .",
    "a nice example is the delay between the start of the outburst in the uv and optical in dne ( e.g. , polidan &  holberg 1987 ) , which has been observed in the form of an x - ray delay with respect to the optical in sxts ( e.g. , orosz et al .",
    "a subgroup of the dne , the suuma stars , shows both short ( @xmath2days ) and long ( @xmath2weeks ) outbursts .",
    "the long outbursts , called superoutbursts , are much less frequent than the short outbursts ( normal outbursts ) , and are somewhat brighter ( @xmath21  mag ) . during superoutbursts",
    "a unique feature develops : a photometric variation with a period , p@xmath3 , a few %  longer than the orbital period , i.e. , the superhump . in fig .  1 , i show the observed superhump period excess , @xmath4 , vs.  the orbital period , p@xmath5 , for suuma stars ( see patterson 1998 and in these proceedings ) .",
    "the recurrence times of normal outbursts are rather erratic . for superoutbursts",
    "they are more stable ; however , they may change from time to time ( vogt 1980 ) .",
    "more or less stable recurrence times have also been found in various sxts ( see priedhorsky 1986 ) .",
    "for example , one of them , 4u1630@xmath147 , showed outbursts every @xmath2600  days .",
    "recently , it was found that its outburst recurrence time had changed to @xmath2680  days , very similar to what is seen in suuma stars ( kuulkers et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "at one of the extreme ends of the suuma stars are the stars with long outburst recurrence times ; for them almost every outburst is a superoutburst .",
    "such stars are known as wzsge stars ( e.g. , bailey 1979 ) , sometimes referred to as toads ( howell et al .",
    "it is this subgroup which indeed shows the strongest similarities with the sxts ( kuulkers et al .",
    "1996 ; see also lasota 1995 ) .",
    "note that ` normal ' suuma stars may also exhibit long intervals of no outbursts during which the source is fainter than normal , such as htcas ( e.g. , robertson &  honeycutt 1996 ) . on the other hand",
    ", some wzsge stars may show periods of more regular outburst behaviour during which the source is somewhat brighter in quiescence than normal , such as bzuma ( jurcevic et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the detection of photometric variations with a period slightly larger than the orbital period during outbursts of sxts immediately pointed to superhumps ( e.g. , charles et al .  1991 , callanan &  charles 1991 ; see odonoghue &  charles 1996 ) . in table  1",
    "i show the sxts for which both the orbital period ( p@xmath5 ) and @xmath6 are known . in three cases",
    "the outburst data reveal clear evidence for superhumps with a period only 12%  longer than the orbital period .",
    "these three sxts can also be found in fig .  1 .",
    "the short superhump period excesses are very similar to those found in various wzsge stars ( e.g. , kuulkers et al .",
    "1996 , patterson et al .",
    "1996 ) .",

    "note that the observed values of @xmath6 in groj0422 + 32 and gs2000 + 25 agree with this relation , but does not for gs1124@xmath168 . at the right side of fig .",
    "1a i supply an additional scaling for @xmath6 based on this relation .",
    "theoretically it has been argued that superhumps only appear in systems with mass ratio @xmath16 ( whitehurst &  king 1991 , whitehurst 1994 ) .",
    "it is , therefore , not surprising that given their values for @xmath6 ( table  1 ) , superhumps are seen in sxts as well ( see , e.g. , also whitehurst 1994 ) . as noted by patterson ( 1998 ) the inferred values of @xmath6 from @xmath4 range up to @xmath20.5 for suuma stars and permanent superhumpers , in contradiction with superhump theory .",
    "superhumps in wzsge stars and sxts have long growth times , i.e. , they appear one or two weeks , respectively , months , after the outburst has started . in ` normal ' suuma stars they apppear after one to several days ( e.g. , vogt 1993 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the strength of the tidal instability decreases below @xmath17 ( e.g. , molnar &  kobulnicky 1992 , whitehurst 1994 ) .",
    "the start of the superhumps in at least groj0422 + 32 was seen to be very close to the start of the secondary maximum , which suggests a possible connection between the two ( kato et al .",
    "the same can be inferred for some of the wzsge stars , e.g. , alcom and egcnc ( see patterson et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "it was , therefore , suggested that the origin of the superhumps and secondary maximum are the same for both the sxts and wzsge stars ( kuulkers et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "reflares after the main outburst or sudden drops with a rebrightening near the end of the outburst are present in several wzsge stars ( see richter 1992 , kuulkers et al .  1996 ; e.g. , uzboo : fig .  1b ) .",
    "the best example of reflares is egcnc which showed up to six ` normal ' outbursts after its main outburst ( patterson et al .",
    "1998 , kato et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the best example of a rebrightening is wzsge itself , which showed a fast drop near the end of the 1978 outburst but came back to stay on for a longer time .",
    "it then gradually decayed to quiescence ( ortolani et al .",
    "1980 , patterson et al .  1981 ) .",
    "reflares / rebrightenings are , however , not exclusively seen in wzsge stars : suuma also showed a reflare after its 1989 outburst ( udalski 1990 ) .    in sxts reflares",
    "have been observed as well .",
    "groj0422 + 32 is the best known example ( callanan et al .",
    "1995 , chevalier &  ilovaisky 1995 ) : it showed two strong and various weaker outbursts after its main outburst .",
    "the sxt 4u1543@xmath147 showed multiple rebrightenings / reflares in x - rays during its 1971/1972 outburst ( li et al .",
    "1976 ) . in groj0422",
    "+ 32 the two strong reflares apeared @xmath2120  days after each other , which is _ similar _ to the time from maximum to the secondary maximum of the outburst ( e.g. , callanan et al .",
    "this also holds for the reflares seen in the wzsge stars ( see kuulkers et al .",
    "a good example is again egcnc ( see kuulkers &  howell 1996 ) : a clear secondary maximum can be seen about a week after outburst maximum , whereas the reflares appeared a week apart ( see , e.g. , patterson et al .",
    "this may indicate a certain clock which operates in both the sxt and wzsge stars which controls the timing of the secondary maximum ( and/or onset of superhumps ) and the time between reflares .",
    "although i have shown here that there are similarities in the outburst behaviour of sxts and wzsge stars / toads , obvious differences are present as well .",
    "the main difference is the fact that sxts harbour a neutron star or a black hole instead of a white dwarf . a black hole ( @xmath03m@xmath11 ) can easily account for the observed low values of @xmath6 .",
    "the presence of such compact stars leads to more energetic outbursts , especially in the x - ray and @xmath18-ray region . strong radiation at these wavelengths almost certainly irradiate the disk and/or secondary star and may influence the duration and/or brightness of the outbursts of sxts ( e.g. , van paradijs &  verbunt 1984 , van paradijs &  mcclintock 1994 , shahbaz &  kuulkers 1998 ) . in dne , irradiation of the accretion disk",
    "is probably not very important ( e.g. , hameury et al .",
    "however , the hot white dwarf , heated during outburst , may influence the very cool ( e.g. , ciardi et al .  1998 ) secondary star in wzsge stars .",
    "this could account for the presence of reflares / rebrightenings in such systems ( warner 1998 , see also lasota in these proceedings ) . in this respect",
    "i note the striking similarity in the outburst amplitude and morphology of the outburst light curves of a0620@xmath100 and alcom ( kuulkers 1998 ) .",
    "the only difference is the timescale of their outburst duration by a factor @xmath25 .",
    "if irradiation influences the outburst brightness in a0620@xmath100 it remains unclear why a similar outburst amplitude can be seen in alcom ; maybe irradiation has less effect on brightness than expected .      very long ( @xmath0month ) outbursts seem to be very rare among dne above the period gap , where most of them belong to the ugem class .",
    "lasota ( 1995 ) made me aware of a ` sketch ' in mason et al .",
    "( 1988 ) of a long ( @xmath240  days ) outburst of ugem which occurred in 1985 .",
    "this was not seen before in this system ; the outburst durations are normally bimodally distributed ( @xmath29 and @xmath217  days ; see , e.g. , van paradijs 1983 ) .",
    "2a shows a compilation of the available visual estimates during that time .",
    "the long outburst is reminiscent to that seen in wzsge stars .",
    "the individual measurements suggest a secondary maximum after more than a week , as can be seen in some wzsge star outburst light curves ( sect .",
    "2.4 ) . however , statistically this may not be significant ( fig",
    "it is interesting to speculate that this long outburst is in a fact a superoutburst and thus may have exhibited superhumps .",
    "a crazy idea is to put ugem in fig .  1a , given @xmath19 and p@xmath20hr ( friend et al .",
    "1990 ) . surprisingly , the inferred value of @xmath4 of ugem ( @xmath29.5% ) is close to the extreme end of the @xmath4 vs.  p@xmath5 relation .",
    "no observations have been done during the 1985 outburst of ugem to confirm the presence of superhumps .",
    "it has been argued earlier that the long outbursts in ugem stars may in fact be superoutbursts ( van paradijs 1983 ) .",
    "however , no superhumps have been seen in the long outbursts ( @xmath22 weeks ) of e.g. , sscyg , despite considerable coverage ( honey et al .",
    "moreover , the recurrence time properties of the long outbursts in ugem stars are different to that of the superoutbursts in suuma stars ( see warner 1995 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note ( see warner 1995 ) that the only suuma star so far above the period gap , i.e. , tumen ( p@xmath21hr ) , has a trimodal distribution of outburst widths , i.e. , short ( @xmath21  day ) , long ( @xmath28  days ) and superoutbursts ( @xmath220  days )",
    ". it could therefore be that ugem s outburst duration distribution also follows a trimodal distribution , where superoutbursts are very rare .    among the wzsge star candidates a few have ( inferred ) orbital periods above and just below the period gap ( see , e.g. , odonoghue et al .",
    "1991 , howell et al .",
    ". these may be candidates of systems which have evolved way past the period minimum ( howell et al .",
    "1997 ; see , however , patterson 1998 ) . among these",
    "are efpeg ( howell et al .",
    "1995 ) ; superhumps were seen during its 1991 outburst with p@xmath22hr ( howell &  fried 1991 , kato &  takata 1991 ) .",
    "the candidates above the period gap were e.g.  dodra , arand and wwcet ( richter 1985 , odonoghue et al .",
    "1991 ) , howell et al .",
    "they seemed to have long outburst recurrence times and large amplitude outbursts .",
    "however , a closer look of the candidates above the period gap have revealed that they are normal ugem stars ( see ritter &  kolb 1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "future observations are needed to see whether efpeg is a real wzsge star , and whether wzsge stars indeed exist above the period gap .",
    "such observations have large implications on our understanding of evolution of cvs among the period minimum ( howell et al .",
    "1997 , patterson 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , such stars , having larger orbital periods , might then be even closer cousins to the sxts .",
