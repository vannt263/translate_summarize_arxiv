    "there are several motivations to revisit , update and improve the analysis in @xcite , the most important being the need to include the high - statistics super - kamiokande ( sk ) observations of neutrino events ( total rate , @xcite , energy spectrum @xcite , and day - night difference @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the few post - sk papers on three - flavor msw oscillations we are aware of @xcite include neither the spectrum information nor day - night variations .",

    "[ chisquare ] where , for completeness , @xmath57 is reported also for the other two local minima and for the no oscillation case .",
    "if the msw hypothesis is accepted , then the msw parameter estimation involves only @xmath51 differences with respect to the global minimum , and the appropriate value of @xmath58 to use is the number of free parameters in the model ( @xmath59 ) , as anticipated for fig .",
    "[ f2 ] .",
    "the first panel of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] refers to the fit to the total rates only .",
    "the three @xmath51 minima are indicated by dots .",
    "the absolute minimum is reached within the sma solution @xmath60 , which represents a very good fit to the data .",
    "the lma solution is also acceptable , while the low solution gives a marginal fit ( see also the upper three rows of tab .",

    "the sk data on the day - night asymmetry ( second panel ) and energy spectrum ( third panel ) exclude large regions in the mass - mixing parameter space ; but are unable to ( dis)prove any of the three solutions , which in fact are present also in the global fit to all data ( fifth panel ; see also the middle three rows of tab .",
    "[ chisquare ] ) .",
    "the spectrum information is somewhat sensitive to the ( uncertain ) value of the _ hep _ neutrino flux ; for instance , an enhancement by a factor @xmath61 helps to fit the high - energy part of the sk spectrum @xcite , and thus it produces a reduction of the excluded regions in the mass - mixing plane ( fourth panel in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) , and a corresponding slight enlargement of the globally allowed regions ( sixth panel ; see also the lower three rows of tab .",

    "[ f2 ] and of tab .",
    "[ chisquare ] , it appears that the inclusion of the day - night and spectral information can significantly change the c.l.s associated to each of three solutions sma , lma , and low . in order to understand better the role of difference pieces of data",

    "[ f3 ] the comparison between data and predictions for the @xmath48 point of the total rate fit ( sma solution at best fit , first row of tab .  [ chisquare ] ) , in the same coordinates as in fig .",

    "[ f3][f5 ] it appears ( as far as total rates are concerned ) that the sma solution represents a very good fit to the sk , ga , and cl data , that the lma solution underestimates slightly the ga and sk data , and that the low solution underestimates the ga rate and overestimates the cl rate .",
    "this explains the ordering in the likelihood of such solutions in tab .",
    "[ chisquare ] : @xmath66 .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ f6 ] shows that the bulk of the sk observed spectrum is basically consistent with a flat shape ( except for the two highest - energy , low - statistics bins ) , and therefore tends to favor the lma and low solutions , rather than the steadily increasing spectrum predicted by the sma solution .",
    "this tendency is slightly enhanced in the case of large _ hep _ neutrino flux ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ) since in this case the lma and low solutions can fit somewhat better the spectrum endpoint .",
    "in other words , the inclusion of the spectrum in the global analysis tends to compensate the different likelihoods of the lma and low solutions with respect to the sma solution .",
    "moreover , the slight excess of observed nighttime events [ eq .  ( [ e4 ] ) ] adds extra likelihood to the lma solution , so that in the global fit one has @xmath67 ( see tab .",
    "[ chisquare ] ) , with the lma solution even more likely than the sma solution in the case of large _ hep _ flux .",
    "from the previous discussion , the following situation emerges for the three msw solutions sma , lma , and low .",
    "none of them can be excluded at 99% c.l .  by the present experimental data .",
    "different pieces of data give indications that are not as consistent as it would be desirable : the total rate information favors the sma solution , the spectral data favor the lma and low solutions , and the day - night data favor the lma solution . in a global fits ,",
    "the three solutions have comparable likelihoods .",
    "although such solutions are subject to change shape and likelihood as more accurate experimental data become available , no dramatic improvement can be really expected in their selection , unless : 1 ) the theoretical uncertainties on the total rates are reduced to the size of the corresponding experimental uncertainties ; 2 ) the total errors associated to the sk spectrum and day - night measurement are significantly reduced ( by , say , a factor @xmath68 ) ; or 3 ) decisive results are found in new solar neutrino experiments such as the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite , the gallium neutrino observatory @xcite , borexino @xcite , and kamland @xcite .",
    "any of these conditions require a time scale of a few years at least ; the same time scale should then be expected in order to ( patiently ) single out one of the three msw solutions ( sma , lma , or low ) .    another aspect of the lma and low solutions emerging from fig .",
    "[ f2 ] is their extension to large values of the mixing angle ( @xmath69 ) , which are often assumed to be realized only through the vacuum oscillation solutions .",
    "since the possibility of nearly maximal @xmath3 mixing for solar neutrinos has gained momentum after the sk evidence for maximal @xmath70 mixing @xmath71 , it is interesting to study it in detail by dropping the usual `` @xmath72 '' variable and by exploring the full range @xmath73 $ ] , as it was done earlier in @xcite .",

    "figure  [ f8 ] shows the region excluded by the sk day - night asymmetry , in the same representation as in fig .",

    "[ f7 ] , and thus the day - night asymmetry contributes only marginally to shape the msw solutions , except at low values of @xmath88 , where it cuts the lower part of the lma solution and disfavors the rightmost part of the sma solution .",

    "both positive and negative values for the spectrum slope can instead occur in the excluded region where the earth regeneration effects are relevant @xcite . for increasing @xmath32 , the spectral information becomes less effective in disfavoring zones of the parameter space , since the energy - dependence of the electron survival probability becomes weaker .",
    "therefore , only the strongest distortion effect ( at @xmath96 ev@xmath6 ) survives at large @xmath88 .",

    "for msw analyses , the maximum amount of information about the sk solar neutrino signal is contained in the double - differential distribution of events in nadir angle @xmath171 and electron recoil energy @xmath172",

    "the experimental errors of such projections ( including statistical fluctuations ) are _ a priori _ strongly correlated , but the published information is not sufficient to recover such correlations . for such reasons , while we include the complete information in @xmath174 above 5.5 mev ( given as an 18-bin spectrum in @xcite ) , we prefer to use only a minimal ( but relevant ) information in @xmath175 , namely , the night - day asymmetry @xmath176 .",
