    "the central theme of this paper is the following result : any three - point genus zero gromov - witten invariant on a grassmannian @xmath1 is equal to a classical intersection number on a homogeneous space @xmath2 of the same lie type .",
    "we prove this when @xmath1 is a type @xmath0 grassmannian , and , in types @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , when @xmath1 is the lagrangian or orthogonal grassmannian parametrizing maximal isotropic subspaces in a complex vector space equipped with a non - degenerate skew - symmetric or symmetric form .",
    "the space @xmath2 depends on @xmath1 and the degree of the gromov - witten invariant considered . for a type @xmath0 grassmannian , @xmath2 is a two - step flag variety , and in the other cases , @xmath2 is a sub - maximal isotropic grassmannian .",
    "our key identity for gromov - witten invariants is based on an explicit bijection between the set of rational maps counted by a gromov - witten invariant and the set of points in the intersection of three schubert varieties in the homogeneous space @xmath2 .",
    "the proof of this result uses no moduli spaces of maps and requires only basic algebraic geometry .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that the intersection and linear span of the subspaces corresponding to points on a curve in a grassmannian , called the kernel and span of the curve , have dimensions which are bounded below and above , respectively .",
    "the aforementioned bijection sends a rational map @xmath6 to the pair consisting of the kernel and span of its image .",
    "( in types @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , the span is the orthogonal complement of the kernel and can therefore be disregarded . )",
    "the first application is in type @xmath0 : our main theorem implies that the problem of finding a positive combinatorial formula for the above gromov - witten invariants on grassmannians is a special case of the problem of providing such a formula for the classical structure constants on flag varieties .",
    "both of these open questions have received much attention in recent years in the contexts of quantum cohomology @xcite , representation theory @xcite , and schubert calculus @xcite .",
    "the present connection becomes particularly interesting due to a conjecture of knutson for the classical structure constants @xcite .",
    "while this conjecture is known to be false in general , we have strong computational evidence suggesting that the conjecture is true in the special case of two - step flag varieties .",
    "thus knutson s conjecture for two - step flags specializes to a conjectural quantum littlewood - richardson rule .    in types",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , our result is used to give new proofs of the structure theorems for the quantum cohomology of lagrangian and orthogonal grassmannians ( denoted @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) which were recently obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the strategy here is to employ schubert calculus on isotropic grassmannians to compute a few key gromov - witten invariants . combining this with some basic geometric results from the aforementioned papers , we deduce the quantum pieri and giambelli formulas for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the earlier proofs relied on an analysis of special loci on certain quot scheme compactifications of the moduli space of degree @xmath9 rational maps to either space .",
