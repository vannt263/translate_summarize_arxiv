    "two experimentally verified theories describe at present the physical world : quantum field theory and general relativity . both have been extremely successful in their tested ranges of applicability .",
    "quantum field theory , particularly implemented in the so - called standard model , describes the types and behavior of elementary particles as measured in accelerator experiments and as experienced by everyday contact with matter .",
    "general relativity is concerned with the classical spacetime in which quantum field theory takes place .",
    "this spacetime , a four - dimensional lorentzian manifold with events being its points , can have a complicated structure both locally and globally and can be influenced by the presence of classically understood matter .",
    "both quantum field theory as applied in the standard model and general relativity indicate intrinsically that they can not be valid under very extreme circumstances .",
    "but moreover they are not fully compatible even under rather usual conditions with the problem being that matter is described by a quantum theory whereas spacetime interacting with the quantum matter is described classically .",
    "for all these reasons it is believed that it should be possible to find a more advanced theory in which also gravity is quantized and in which both the compatibility problem for general relativity and quantum field theory and their internal problems are resolved .",
    "such theories have already been proposed , most notably string theory @xcite .",
    "while the internal consistency of such a theory turns out to be a difficult problem , another issue arises once the theory is formulated .",
    "how can one relate it to the physical world ?",
    "the interpretational side of a physical theory has at certain points of history not been trivial but here the question stands with a new urgency .",
    "practically all measurements that are performed in experimental physics use implicitly the notion of classical spacetime .",
    "the measurements of positions and times play a dominant role , and there is a clear practical understanding of them .",
    "but in a theory where gravity is quantized , there is no classical spacetime in its postulates .",
    "the obvious conclusion is that unless one is able to recover from such a theory classical spacetime , at least in an approximative sense , the theory may be a nice piece of mathematics but does not make contact with the physical world and is as a physical theory rather useless .",
    "this work is concerned with providing a tool for recovering classical spacetime from an advanced theory and is thus aimed at the interpretation of a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "it is assumed here that such a theory can first be simplified to an effective low energy theory which will look like a usual quantum field theory but without having specified spacetime yet .",
    "in such a situation no lorentzian manifold is present , but there are many structures that contain what one can call spectral information .",
    "it comes from the structure of the algebra of observables of the effective theory and eventually from structures like the decoherence functional of generalized quantum mechanics .",
    "the problem is thus to describe classical spacetime by spectral data .",
    "there is a theory doing just that for riemannian spaces : a. connes noncommutative geometry @xcite .",
    "noncommutative geometry describes classical spaces by commutative algebras of functions on them together with some additional structures on them .",
    "it is actually more powerful than is needed here : noncommutative geometry is able to deal even with noncommutative algebras not corresponding to any classical space . in an indirect way",
    "this fact is actually useful even in the present situation where only a classical space is wished for : the understanding of the general noncommutative case is more direct in separating out which concepts are of fundamental importance and which are from a broader perspective just particularities .",
    "one structure recognized in this way as being important , the spectral triple , will be especially useful in the considerations presented .",
    "so in a more specific view the problem is to discuss how noncommutative geometry can be used to describe spacetime in the particular commutative case .",
    "unfortunately , the present mathematical framework is able to deal only with spaces of riemannian type , having a nonnegative distance between any two points .",
    "there it is very efficient in using spectral data : practically all the geometric information is contained in just a few relatively simple structures .",
    "the question is whether the same is possible in the lorentzian case .",
    "the answer to this question is the main topic and result of this work .",
    "compared to riemannian spectral geometry there is a new phenomenon recognized : causal relationships .",
    "inspired by the thorough discussion of causality in quantum field theory @xcite , its place in the framework of noncommutative geometry is found . with this understanding it is possible to show that again , as in riemannian geometry , the spectral data exhibit a remarkable efficiency in the description of lorentzian spaces , at least if they are globally hyperbolic which will be assumed throughout .",
    "this gives hope that the adopted approach may turn out to be actually useful in the way it is wished to be useful from the physical context .",
    "several remarks and conjectures on applications in physical interpretations are put forward .",
    "many technical questions are left open for further considerations but have now a clearer formulation and context and can thus be attacked gradually .",
    "the work is organized in the following way :    section [ fieldsection ] discusses a free weyl spinor field and the fermionic quantization of its covariant phase space .",
    "the local and causal structures of this field theory are emphasized in section [ localobservables ] .",
    "section [ connesspectraltriple ] reviews briefly the spectral triple of connes spectral geometry .",
    "a nave spectral description of lorentzian globally hyperbolic manifolds is given in section [ sng ] .",
    "in section [ lorentzspectraldata ] the information contained in causal relationships is discussed and used to obtain a rather compact description of spacetime .",
    "the view obtained is the main result of this work .",
    "this is summarized in the conclusion .",
    "the field theory considered in this paper will be that of a fermionic weyl spinor field .",
    "this choice is maybe not overly surprising in view of the role played by such fields in the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the primary motivation is , however , the importance of spinor fields in spectral geometry as will become clear in section [ connesspectraltriple ] .",
    "the covariant phase space @xmath0 of a classical free weyl spinor field @xmath1 is the linear space of solutions of the equation of motion following from the action @xmath2 , @xmath3 & = re \\int_{\\omega } { \\bar{\\psi }   d \\psi d\\omega},\\label{action}\\\\ \\intertext{i.e .",

    "if the spacetime manifold @xmath8 is assumed to be globally hyperbolic ( i.e. , is topologically @xmath9 , sliced by spacelike cauchy surfaces diffeomorphic to the 3-dimensional manifold @xmath10 @xcite ) then there is a hermitean inner product @xmath11 on the space of solutions @xmath0 of the dirac equation expressed as an integral over a spacelike cauchy surface @xmath10 , @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the future directed hypersurface element induced from the spacetime volume element @xmath14 . in order for @xmath11 to be a hermitean inner product on the space of solutions @xmath0",
    ", it has to be independent of the choice of @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , given two spacelike cauchy hypersurfaces @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the difference in the corresponding hermitean inner products can be by stokes theorem expressed by a spacetime integral over the region @xmath17 enclosed by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , vanishing in consequence of the equation of motion [ diracequation ] : @xmath18 the real part @xmath19 of the hermitean inner product @xmath11 , @xmath20 is a real bilinear symmetric inner product on the phase space @xmath0 .",
    "its inverse is the fermionic causal green s function @xmath21 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the fermionic causal green s function @xmath21 has the meaning of the poisson bracket @xmath22 of classical mechanics @xcite : @xmath23    once the classical description of a system ( e.g. a field ) is known , one can make an educated guess of what the correct quantum theory is , i.e. , one can quantize the field theory . in principle",
    "there are two rather different ways to do that , namely quantization by path integrals @xcite and canonical quantization ( see , e.g.@xcite ) . here",
    "the latter is chosen , since it leads more directly to an algebraic setting used in noncommutative geometry .    in fermionic canonical quantization , chosen in agreement with the spin - statistics theorem@xcite ,",
    "one starts with the classical phase space @xmath0 equipped with the symmetric inner product @xmath19 .",
    "the functions on the classical phase space @xmath0 , the classical observables , are then replaced by elements in a noncommutative algebra , the algebra of observables following some rules which turned out to be useful in particular cases .",
    "the rules are as follows :    first , a special set @xmath24 of function on the phase space has to be selected .",
    "the set @xmath24 of chosen classical observables should be closed under taking the poisson bracket @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 second , a linear map @xmath27 into a complex associative algebra @xmath28 should be given , @xmath29 the map @xmath27 should satisfy a commutation relation replacing the poisson bracket by a commutator : @xmath30 and its image @xmath31 should generate the algebra @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath24 contains the constant functions on @xmath0 ( which have vanishing poisson brackets with all other functions on @xmath0 ) , then their image under the mapping @xmath27 must be in the centre of the algebra @xmath28 , and if @xmath28 is central then the image of constant functions is proportional to the unit @xmath32 in the algebra .",
    "a not very surprising addition to the quantization rules then usually is the requirement @xmath33    in general , one of the difficulties of these rules is the potentially complicated anticommutation relation ( [ anticommutationrelation ] ) , and another is the choice of @xmath24 .",
    "obvious choices , like the space of all continuous functions on @xmath0 , are plagued by inconsistencies or by giving an algebra that is far too big compared with the one that gives a quantum theory in agreement experiment .",
    "to deal with this situation , additional information is usually necessary ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and even then it is a difficult problem .",
    "the situation radically simplifies for a free system ( i.e. one with a linear phase space @xmath0 ) as the one considered here .",
    "the correct choice of @xmath24 is then the space of linear observables .",
    "one can define the field operator @xmath34 for a classical solution @xmath35 @xmath36 and write the anticommutation relation ( [ anticommutationrelation ] ) in the form @xmath37    the @xmath38-algebra of observables of the quantum field generated from this anticommutation relation is unique and independent of a completion of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it has a unique minimal enveloping von neumann algebra @xcite having , up to unitary isomorphism , a unique regular irreducible representation by bounded operators in a hilbert space .",
    "there is no information whatsoever in this algebra about the smooth structure of spacetime .",
    "if the @xmath38-algebra of observables is considered by itself , without reference to its origin , then it is sufficient to express the evolution of the field by automorphisms and the space of states by normed positive linear functionals ( see @xcite ) , but then the physical interpretation is completely lost .",
    "a somewhat similar loss of interpretation can be observed if a classical system is judged on the basis of its phase space only , where canonical transformations can rather arbitrarily change the meaning of coordinates and momenta .",
    "it is possible to argue that , e.g. , the topology of the phase space is specific to the system , but this is by no means sufficient to give a complete description if there actually is a fundamental distinction between coordinates and momenta .",
    "as mentioned in section [ fieldsection ] , the algebra of observables does in this case not contain any information about spacetime .",
    "some structure has thus to be given to the algebra of observables of a quantum field in order to enable one to give its physical interpretation .",
    "one could , of course , just remember the whole construction of the algebra of observables , starting with the classical field . in a path integral",
    "approach this would not be so bad , since classical histories are part of that framework , but in an algebraic approach to quantum field theory , where the classical field has just the position of an effective approximation , this is definitely not what one would wish to do .",
    "the widely accepted solution is to give the algebra of observables the structure of a local algebra @xcite .",
    "the idea is to associate with each region of spacetime @xmath7 a subalgebra @xmath39 of the algebra @xmath28 of observables .",
    "thus one obtains a set of subalgebras indexed ( not necessarily unambiguously ) by the set @xmath40 of open subsets of spacetime .    for many technical purposes",
    "it is not necessary to keep the reference to spacetime , and only some properties of the index set @xmath40 are extracted and required .",
    "this is the case of the definition of a quasi - local algebra @xcite .",
    "however , since here interpretation is the main concern , the full link to spacetime will be required @xcite .",
    "a @xmath38-algebra @xmath28 together with a spacetime manifold @xmath8 is local if the following three conditions all hold :    1 .   for each open subset @xmath7 of @xmath8",
    "there is a central @xmath38-algebra @xmath39 , with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "2 .   for any collection @xmath43 of open subsets of @xmath8 one has @xmath44",
    "( on the right hand side of this equation is the closure of the algebraic envelope @xmath45 of @xmath46 . )",
    "3 .   if the regions @xmath47 , @xmath48 are not in causal contact , then the corresponding algebras @xmath49 , @xmath50 commute in the bose case and graded - commute in the fermi case .",
    "the quantized weyl spinor field can be given the structure of a local algebra .",
    "the green s function @xmath21 of the field can be used to produce from any smooth density @xmath51 on the spacetime manifold @xmath8 a solution @xmath52 : @xmath53 and to each solution @xmath52 one can by ( [ solutionfield ] ) associate a quantum observable @xmath34 . given a subset @xmath7 of spacetime , the algebra @xmath39 can be then generated by densities with support in @xmath7 .",
    "if the supports of two measures @xmath54 , @xmath55 are not causally connected , then the corresponding classical solutions @xmath56 , @xmath57 can be checked to have a vanishing product @xmath58 , and the corresponding quantum observables @xmath59 , @xmath60 thus anticommute .",
    "a pleasant feature of the local algebra structure is that the @xmath38-subalgebras @xmath39 ( with @xmath61 ) of @xmath28 are actually sufficient to reconstruct the spacetime @xmath8 as a topological space and to determine its causal structure , as observed by u.yurtsever @xcite .",
    "a geometric space may be described by its set of points with some additional structures , or , alternatively , by the algebra of functions on it , again with some additional structures .",
    "the first point of view is the one of classical geometry .",
    "the second may be taken as a starting point for a far more general and powerful theory , a. connes noncommutative geometry @xcite , and is adopted here . in particular , a space can be encoded in the form of a spectral triple @xcite .",

    "in addition to that , its dimension is governed by the spectrum of the dirac operator @xcite .",
    "so a theorem examining which commutative spectral triples are classical riemannian manifolds is not out of sight .",

    "this is obvious , e.g. , from the distance function ( [ distancefunction ] ) , which can not be negative .",
    "a simple idea to avoid this difficulty is to foliate the spacetime @xmath8 by a family of spacelike cauchy slices @xmath92 with @xmath93 a coordinate time ( see figure [ slicing ] ) .",

    "second , from the point of view of quantum field theory the orthogonality of classical solutions with cauchy data locally supported around two points @xmath112 , @xmath113 has as its consequence ( or , if one wishes , as its origin ) the graded commutativity of the corresponding @xmath38-subalgebras of the local algebra @xmath28 of observables generated from @xmath0 .",
    "this is the point where the notion of causality makes contact with section [ localobservables ] and with some of the motivations for this work given in the introduction .",
    "now the consequences of observation [ observation ] will be discussed .",
    "first of all , the family of spectral triples @xmath99 of section [ connesspectraltriple ] contains already all necessary information about spacetime and no automorphism @xmath103 between the algebras @xmath100 and no lapse function @xmath95 need to be specified .",
    "indeed , by knowing the geometry of the cauchy surfaces @xmath92 corresponding to the spectral triples @xmath99 and the causal structure one can find the normal identifications of points and the normal distances between infinitesimally close cauchy surfaces ( see figure [ lightcone ] ) .    [ lightcone ] = 5 in    thus a large part of the spectral data can be just left out , and the remaining family of spectral triples gives now a quite efficient description .",
    "but it is still considerably redundant . to see this is not difficult : if the metric information contained in the operators @xmath101",
    "is omitted , then the conformal structure of spacetime is still rigidly fixed .",
    "but not all metrics are conformally related , and thus the @xmath101 determining the metric on the cauchy surfaces can not be chosen at will but have to agree with the conformal structure .",
    "this means that the spectral data of spacetime can be further reduced .",
    "how this has to be done in a useful way will be left for consideration in the future .",
    "but even without that a conceptual result is appearing : the spectral data describing a lorentzian manifold do so in a very efficient way .",
    "this result based on observation [ observation ] is the main claim of this work .",
    "there is a way of giving less redundant spectral data , if one is willing to lose metric information and keep just the conformal structure of spacetime .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that for building just differential geometry without metric information , it is sufficient to take , instead of the spectral triple with an unbounded operator @xmath66 , the same spectral triple but with @xmath66 replaced by @xmath126 , the sign of the operator @xmath66 .",
    "this is actually a grading operator on @xmath0 since @xmath127 .",
    "thus the spectral triple @xmath128 with a family of grading operators contains the topological and causal as well as differential geometric information on spacetime .",
    "one may wonder where the efficiency of the spectral data in the presented description comes from . in the case of the spectral triple a. connes",
    "argued @xcite that most of the information is not in the algebra of the triple , giving basically just a set of points , nor in the chosen hermitean operator , fully described by its spectrum , but in the relationship between them .",
    "this explanation can be used here again : most of the information in the spectral data is not in the commutative algebras @xmath100 represented on @xmath0 but in the relationships between them .",
    "indeed , the strong causal structure is purely a result of this .",
    "motivated by the need to recover classical spacetime from a theory of quantum gravity in order to achieve the theory s physical interpretation , the thesis examines the possibility of describing classical lorentzian spacetime manifolds by spectral data .",
    "following in section [ sng ] a nave hamiltonian approach , the spectral data for a lorentzian manifold are specified as a family of a. connes spectral triples with a common hilbert space and additional structures known from hamiltonian general relativity : a family of lapse functions and an identification of cauchy surfaces implemented by isomorphisms of the algebras in the spectral triples .",
    "this gives a complete description of spacetime , trivially extended to a free quantum field theory on spacetime .",
    "however , in section [ lorentzspectraldata ] it is realized that the spectral description of spacetime automatically contains unused information on causal relationships .",
    "the use of this information leads to a significant reduction of the spectral data .",
    "the family of lapse functions and the identification of cauchy surfaces can be completely left out , and still there is considerable redundancy in the data present .",
    "the discovery of the place of causal relationships in spectral geometry thus leads to a very efficient spectral description of spacetime .",
    "this is the main result of this thesis .    with the result attained here , there are now two well motivated problems of conceptual importance :    1",
    ".   the remaining redundancy in the spectral data should be removed and the result put into a useful form to be recognized as standard .",
    "the way in which the result may fit into an interpretation of quantum gravity should be clarified , possibly along the lines of conjectures [ 1stconjecture ] and [ 2ndconjecture ]    moreover , there are also many further points of technical nature , to be worked out . to suggest just one of them as an example",
    ", it would be desirable to have a usefully formulated expression for spacetime distances .    with the insight obtained here ,",
    "these questions are now open to future investigations .",
    "the author would like to thank pavel krtou , don n. page and georg peschke for a number of invaluable discussions .",
