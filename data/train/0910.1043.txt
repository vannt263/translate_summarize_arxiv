    "understanding the origin of the hierarchical pattern of quark masses and mixings has long been recognized as a challenge for physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "the discovery of neutrino masses and mixings with totally different flavor pattern than quarks ( i.e. @xmath1 and @xmath2 as against @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) has added more mystery to the flavor problem . in generic bottom - up pictures where quarks and leptons are treated as different species of particles with no particular relation between them ,",
    "this problem is not so serious since one can simply focus on each sector separately , as is often done for neutrinos @xcite .",
    "however , in grand unified theories where the quarks and leptons unify at a very high scale , one would naively expect that their masses and mixings would exhibit a similar pattern .",
    "the fact that they are so different may be hint of some really new exciting underlying physics . in this note",
    "we address this question in the context of supersymmetric so(10 ) models with renormalizable yukawa couplings being responsible for fermion masses .",
    "we show that in so(10 ) models with * 10 * , * 126 * plus possibly another * 10 * or * 120 * higgs fields where fermion masses are generated by renormalizable yukawa couplings @xcite only and where type ii seesaw is responsible for neutrino masses @xcite , there is a natural way to have a unified understanding of both large lepton mixings and small quark ones .",
    "the basic idea is to require that one of the * 10 * yukawa couplings is the dominant one contributing to up , down and charged lepton masses and has rank one with other smaller couplings providing neutrino masses as well as most of the quark lepton flavor hierarchy .",
    "rank one plus small corrections as a way to unravel fermion flavor in d - brane models was discussed in @xcite .",
    "we find that so(10 ) models with type ii seesaw @xcite are ideally suited for such an ansatz",
    ". a specific form of the rank one matrix can lead to tri - bimaximal mixing with corrections dictated by the quark flavor pattern .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we review the mass formulae in so(10 ) models with renormalizable couplings ; in sec .",
    "iii , we summarize our basic strategy for understanding the quark lepton flavor in a unified manner , discuss the rank one ansatz and apply it both the two generation case ( iiia ) and three generation cases ( iiib ) . in sec .",
    "iiic , we present realistic three generation models and outline their predictions . sec .",
    "iv is devoted to some specific conjectures for the rank one matrix which could emerge from discrete symmetry models with specific discussion on the correction to tri - bimaximal mixings .",
    "v is devoted to a possible way to obtain the rank one ansatz in so(10 ) models and in sec .",
    "vi , we present our conclusions .",
    "the basic idea in this class of models is to consider susy so(10 ) theory with higgs fields that give fermion masses to be in * 10 * ( denoted by @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 ( denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) plus either an extra * 10 * ( @xmath9 ) or * 120 * ( @xmath10 ) . the gut symmetry is broken by * 210*+*54*+*126*+@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the yukawa superpotential of this model is : @xmath12 where the symbol @xmath13 stands for the * 16 * dimensional representation of so(10 ) that represents the matter fields .",
    "the coupling matrices @xmath14 and @xmath15 are symmetric , and @xmath16 is symmetric or anti - symmetric depending on whether we adopt @xmath17 or @xmath10 .",
    "the representations @xmath5 , @xmath9 and @xmath7 have two standard model ( sm ) doublets in each of them whereas @xmath10 has four such doublets . the general way to understand so",
    "many sm doublets is that at the gut scale @xmath18 , once the gut and the @xmath19 symmetry are broken , one linear combination of the up - type doublets and one of down - type ones remain almost massless whereas the remaining ones acquire gut scale masses just like the color triplet and other non - mssm multiplets .",
    "the electroweak symmetry is broken after the light mssm doublets ( to be called @xmath20 ) acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) and they then generate the fermion masses .",
    "the resulting mass formulae for different fermion masses are given by : @xmath21 where @xmath22 are mass matrices divided by the electro - weak vev @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the mixing parameters which relate the @xmath20 to the doublets in the various gut multiplets .",
    "more precisely , the matrices @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 in @xmath22 are multiplied by the higgs mixings",
    ". the precise definitions of the couplings and the higgs mixings are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "when @xmath17 is adopted for the @xmath16 coupling , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in generic so(10 ) models of this type , the neutrino mass formula has a type i @xcite and a type ii @xcite contributions : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the vev of the @xmath30 triplet in the * 126 * higgs field and is given by @xmath31 .",
    "note that in general , the two contributions to neutrino mass depend on two different parameters and it is easy to have symmetry breaking pattern in so(10 ) @xcite where the first contribution ( the type ii term ) dominates over the type i term .",
    "the neutrino mass formula then becomes @xmath32 note that @xmath15 is the same coupling matrix that appears in the charged fermion masses in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , up to factors from the higgs mixings and the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "the equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) are the key equations in our unified approach to address the flavor problem .",
    "the main hypothesis of our approach is that the fermion mass formula of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) are dominated by the matrix @xmath14 with the contributions of @xmath15 and @xmath33 being small perturbations . in the limit of @xmath34 ,",
    "the quark and lepton mixings vanish as do the neutrino masses",
    ". we will show below that this simple hypothesis combined with eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) can simultaneously explain large lepton mixings while keeping the quark mixings being proportional to @xmath35 and hence small .",
    "we will subsequently assume that the matrix @xmath14 has rank one in which case the mass hierarchy can also be explained in a natural manner .",
    "the quark and lepton mixing matrices are given by the product of diagonalizing unitary matrices for quark and lepton mass matrices as follows : denoting the diagonalizing matrices of @xmath36 , @xmath37 by @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively ( e.g. , @xmath40 and similarly for the down quark mass matrix ) , the ckm ( cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ) quark mixing matrix is given as @xmath41 . the pmns ( pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ) lepton mixing matrix is given as @xmath42 in the similar notation ( e.g. , @xmath43 ) .",
    "in general , when two matrices with random @xmath44 elements are considered , the mixing angles of the relative diagonalizing unitary matrices are all @xmath44 in radian , while the eigenvalues can have a hierarchy of @xmath45 .",
    "in such an anarchical scenario , the neutrino masses and mixings can be explained ( except for the chooz bound of 13 neutrino mixing ) : the neutrino mixings are generically @xmath44 and there is a little hierarchy for the neutrino mass squared difference ratio @xmath46 @xcite . on the other hand , since the quark mixings are all smaller than @xmath44 and the masses of quarks and charged leptons are very much hierarchical , anarchic mass matrices in general provide no explanation of these observations .",
    "besides , it appears that the mass ratios and ckm mixings have several correlations among them .",
    "it is therefore to be expected that the quark and lepton matrices instead of being independent anarchic matrices must have some relations among them and an underlying theory leading to these relations . in this paper",
    "we find that so(10 ) with type ii seesaw could be such a theory .    when the fermion masses are given by the eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , several possible outcomes are obtained by simple assumptions . to understand these possible outcomes from the eqs.([eq2 ] ) and",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , let us first ignore @xmath16 .",
    "we then have the following possibilities :    _ assumption 1 : _    take @xmath14 , @xmath15 are general rank 3 matrices , and @xmath15 is small .",
    "this is the case analyzed to fit observed experimental data and to obtain predictions from the minimality of the number of parameters in various papers @xcite . here",
    ", we list the properties resulting from the smallness of @xmath15 without resorting to any numerical fit .    *",
    "the ckm mixings are small , due to the fact that there is an approximate up - down symmetry and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "* bottom - tau unification up to @xmath48 . *",
    "the 3 neutrino mixings are generically of @xmath44 since @xmath14 and @xmath15 are unrelated matrices .",
    "the type ii seesaw dominance of the neutrino mass is crucial for the generic largeness of the neutrino mixings .",
    "thus it is interesting that without any special assumption , the gross features of fermion mixings can be reproduced .",
    "this does not , however , throw any light on the mass hierarchies among quarks and leptons , though one can fit the experimental results by the choices of parameters ( even in the type i seesaw ) @xcite . since we use the experimental data as an input",
    ", these scenarios do not provide a fundamental understanding of either the mass hierarchy for quarks and charged leptons , or why the 13 neutrino mixing ( @xmath0 ) is less than @xmath44 .",
    "similar situation holds for models where @xmath16 is added @xcite .    _ assumption 2 : _",
    "let us next consider the specific case when @xmath14 is a rank 1 matrix @xcite , and @xmath15 is a rank 3 matrix with eigenvalues of @xmath15 being hierarchical ( @xmath49 ) and small compared to the elements of @xmath14 . as we noted in ref.@xcite , this choice helps to suppress proton decay in susy so(10 ) models without invoking huge cancellations among the colored higgsino exchange amplitudes . in this case",
    "we will show in the next two subsections that the following results follow :    1 .",
    "ckm mixings are small .",
    "2 .   approximate bottom - tau unification occurs .",
    "3 .   @xmath50 .",
    "the quark mixing are related as @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is a phase ) and @xmath53 .",
    "atmospheric and solar neutrino mixings are generically large , but 13 mixing is @xmath54 .",
    "all these predictions are in qualitative agreement with observations .",
    "the advantage of the rank one assumption is that it naturally explains the mass hierarchies among quarks and leptons in addition to large lepton mixings .",
    "we emphasize that these features are obtained from the rank 1 assumption above without using any numerical inputs , and our claim here is not based on the scenario of the numerical predictions from a fit in which the minimality of parameters plays a key role .    before we do a full demonstration of these results in the context of a three generation model ,",
    "let us illustrate the first four points in the context of a two generation model .      in this subsection , we apply our rank one hypothesis to the second and the third generation .",
    "we will confirm the results 1 - 4 mentioned above .",
    "the starting point is the mass relation from eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) where we ignore the @xmath16 contribution .",
    "using our assumption , we have @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( without loss of generality , we can parameterize @xmath15 to be diagonal ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 is of @xmath44 in general .",
    "we now have ten parameters ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 as real parameters , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 as complex parameters , and @xmath29 for neutrino mass scale ) describing ten observables of all lepton and quark mixings and masses .",
    "one can easily obtain @xmath63 at the leading order neglecting @xmath64 correction , where @xmath65 is a ratio of vevs of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , @xmath59 corresponds to the freedom of @xmath65 , @xmath68 .    when @xmath69 , we obtain @xmath70 because @xmath71 , @xmath62 is small , i.e. @xmath72 .    to proceed further , we first diagonalize the charged fermion mass matrices to zeroth order in @xmath73 .",
    "the matrix diagonalizing this is given by @xmath74 since @xmath75 .",
    "let us now see how the small quark mixings arise despite large mixings in @xmath76 . because @xmath77 has a small off - diagonal element , @xmath78 , the down - type quark mass matrix is diagonalized by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is close to unit matrix whose off - diagonal element is @xmath81 .",
    "the up - type quark mass matrix is diagonalized by @xmath82 , where the off - diagonal element of @xmath83 is @xmath84 .",
    "the quark mixing matrix is then given by @xmath85 , in this product @xmath76 cancels out leaving small mixings between the two generations i.e. small @xmath86 , where @xmath52 is a phase of @xmath62 .",
    "coming now to lepton mixings , suppose that the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonalized by @xmath87 , then it can be written as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is close to a unit matrix similarly to the quark sector , and is roughly equal to @xmath90 .",
    "since the neutrino mass matrix is already diagonal as a parameterization , the pmns matrix is given by the charged lepton mixings so that @xmath91 .",
    "this leads to a large lepton mixing as desired . in the two generation case",
    ", @xmath57 describes approximately ( up to small corrections of order @xmath92 ) the  atmospheric mixing angle \" .",
    "since this was an input into our rank one ansatz , we can choose to be large to explain the observations .",
    "if @xmath93 and @xmath62 are assumed to be real , there are six real parameters in this model . in this case ,",
    "@xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 can be written as a function of @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath92 for example .",
    "even if @xmath93 and @xmath62 are all complex , we have the following approximate relation at the grand unified scale : @xmath99 since the relations are satisfied under the assumption of approximate rank 1 property irrespective of the counting of freedom , they are stable even in the case of three generation model . indeed , the predictivity from the minimality of the parameter is related to the @xmath64 corrections , and the minimality does not play a crucial role in the approximate relations from the rank 1 assumption .",
    "it is known that there is a solution that the large atmospheric mixing is obtained even if the smallness of @xmath15 is not assumed a priori . in the scenario , the @xmath100-@xmath101 mass convergence as well as the other experimental inputs predict the neutrino mixing as an output @xcite .",
    "our main goal in this section is not to give numerical predictions but rather to show how one can get qualitatively expected hierarchical pattern for masses and mixings .",
    "later on we of course study the detailed numerical predictions . as it turns out there is a fine - tuned solution to fit the experimental data even if @xmath61 is comparable to @xmath58 .",
    "however such a fine - tuned solution is sensitive to the numerical inputs , and therefore the numerical predictions in this case may be unstable under a possible higher order correction . in our case",
    "where the quark and lepton mass hierarchy is predicted by the rank 1 assumption , they are stable under radiative corrections .    while the qualitative predictions are in the expected range , we note that the approximate relation @xmath102 is not very good agreement with the current observation , and small @xmath16 will be invoked to obtain the best fit of the experimental data .",
    "we emphasize that our final solutions do not use any fine tuned cancellations , and thus are stable even if we add small corrections to fit the numerical experimental data .",
    "the fermion mass equations for this case are those in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) with all coupling matrices being @xmath103 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath14 has rank one means that we can write it as @xmath104 @xmath105 again , we can parameterize @xmath15 to be diagonal and @xmath106 to be real without loss of generality . at first , we ignore @xmath16 . in order to analyze the detailed consequences of this assumption",
    ", we go to the basis where @xmath14 is diagonal .",
    "this is achieved by the matrix : @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 with @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the diagonalization matrix there is an ambiguity resulting from the residual su(2 ) flavor symmetry in @xmath14 ( i.e. one of three mixing angles is not fixed at this stage ) .",
    "we choose the unitary matrix @xmath76 to be an approximate leading order diagonalization matrix of @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 as in the previous subsection ( @xmath82 , @xmath79 , and @xmath115 where @xmath116 are close to a unit matrix ) .",
    "then , once the @xmath15 contribution is included , the afore mentioned su(2 ) flavor symmetry is broken and the ambiguity in mixing angles alluded to above is removed .",
    "we wish to note that in our original parameterization of @xmath76 , we chose the 13 element to be zero since even after including the @xmath15-contribution , the 13 element goes to zero in the limit @xmath117 ( which is the limit where @xmath118 is rank 2 ) .",

    "mixing is not in the category of the generic largeness since it is related to the ratio of eigenvalues of @xmath15 .",
    "the eigenvalue ratio is also related to @xmath138 implying that the 13 mixing angle has to be small in our approach .",
    "it is important to note that we do not assume a particular flavor texture such like hierarchical pattern in one matrix to obtain the feature .",
    "the key property to obtain the features for the neutrino mixings is that the correction to the rank one charged lepton mass matrix and the type ii seesaw term are unified ( or more roughly , simultaneously diagonalized ) , as a result of so(10 ) unification .",
    "the discussion above gives the qualitative consequences of the rank one property , and the experimental inputs are not used to obtain the features .",
    "the discussion below will address the issue of the experimental data for the first generation .",
    "actually , we have not listed the first generation masses and @xmath139 before .",
    "in fact , if @xmath140 , one obtains the following relation among the fermion masses : @xmath141 where @xmath142 .",

    "one of the first generation masses can not be fitted . besides , since @xmath145 in eq.([check - v ] ) is common for up- and down - type quarks , @xmath139 becomes too small compared to observations , since @xmath146 .",

    ", we consider special cases where the dominant part of the lepton mixing is in the tri - bimaximal form @xcite .",
    "this would require special form for the rank one matrix @xmath14 .",
    "we envisage that the rank one form for @xmath14 as well as the matrix forms for @xmath15 and @xmath33 come from some vacuum alignment of flavon fields , e.g. , @xcite .    in the triplet flavon models ,",
    "the @xmath103 matrix can be expanded by the tensor products of the flavon fields when there are three independent flavons .",
    "the three flavon fields can be expressed ( without loss of generality , by making unitary transformations ) as @xmath201 in general , there is no reason for the flavon vevs to be hierarchical , and the large neutrino mixings can originate from @xmath202 , @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "the experimental result from the neutrino oscillation seems to imply a special alignment of flavon vevs rather than the generic largeness , namely @xcite , @xmath204 the vacuum alignment can be obtained by imposing a discrete flavor symmetry @xcite , leading to tri - bimaximal neutrino mixings .",
    "it is worth pointing out at the beginning that the aligned flavon fields can be written in several ways by choice of coordinates ( or by making unitary transformations ) and the final results are independent of the coordinate choice .",
    "it is interesting to note that the aligned flavon vevs correspond to a link of a hexahedron , a diagonal line of a lateral surface , a diagonal line of a regular hexahedron , respectively .",
    "the interpretation becomes clear when the flavon fields are expanded in terms of the following orthogonal axes of coordinates ( called hexahedral coordinate ) @xmath205 which correspond to the three lateral links of the regular hexahedron .",
    "the hexahedral coordinate is convenient to describe the @xmath206 rotation around the surface - diagonal axes of the hexahedron .",
    "in fact , the regular hexahedron has different coordinates to describe the symmetry of the shape .",

    "this difference is directly due to the rigorousness of @xmath297 symmetry in the @xmath15 coupling from the tri - bimaximal ansatz ( @xmath298 ( model i ) ) where the @xmath15 coupling has @xmath299 symmetry . in model",
    "i , the deviation from the maximal angle is related to @xmath92 , while in model ii , the deviation is related to @xmath0 .",
    "the current best fit value of the atmospheric mixing angle ( @xmath300 @xcite ) is nearly the maximal mixing , and it implies the model i. however , the error is still large .",

    "when the direct couplings of chiral fermions with a higgs field are forbidden by a symmetry , and the effective yukawa couplings are generated by propagating vector - like matter fields , the rank of the effective yukawa matrix depends on the number of the vector - like fields . actually , when there are only one pair of vector - like matter fields as a flavor singlet , the effective yukawa matrix is rank 1 .",

    "we suggest this as a possible way to address the challenge of a unified description of quark - lepton flavor . we have not attempted in this note to derive our ansatz from any specific discrete symmetries , although we show a guideline to obtain a rank one form from a higher than gut scale theory",
