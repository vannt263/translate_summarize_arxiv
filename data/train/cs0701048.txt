    "a typical wireless sensor network consists of sensor nodes with limited energy reserves .",
    "many sensor network applications expect the sensor nodes to be active for months and may be years . however , in most of the situations , once the sensor nodes run out of their energy reserves , then replacing their batteries is not possible either due to the inaccessibility of sensor nodes or because such an endeavor may not be economically viable .",
    "so , there is a great demand and scope of the strategies which attempt to reduce the energy consumption , hence increase the lifetime of the sensor nodes .",
    "sensor nodes spend energy in receiving and transmitting data , sensing / actuating , and computation . in this paper , we concern ourselves with reducing the energy cost of transmission .",
    "the energy cost of receiving data can be easily incorporated in the model that we propose .",
    "the energy spent in sensing / actuating represents a fixed cost that can be ignored .",
    "we assume computation costs are negligible compared to radio communication costs . though this is a debatable assumption in dense networks , but incorporating computation costs is not straightforward and is left for future work .",
    "the transmission energy depends on three factors : the number of bits to be transmitted , the path - loss factor between the sensor nodes and the base - station , and the time available to transmit the given number of bits .",
    "the path - loss factor describes the wireless channel between a sensor node and the base - station and captures various channel effects , such as distance induced attenuation , shadowing , and multipath fading . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the path - loss factor to be constant .",
    "this is reasonable for static networks and also the scenarios where the path - loss factor varies slowly and can be accurately tracked .",
    "the idea of varying the transmission time to reduce the energy consumption was proposed in @xcite and explored in @xcite in the context of sensor networks , where its @xmath1-hardness is discussed . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to reduce the transmission energy by reducing the number of bits transmitted by the sensor nodes to the base - station .    in a data gathering sensor network ,",
    "the spatio - temporal correlations in sensor data induce data - redundancy . in @xcite , slepian and wolf",
    "show that it is possible to compress a set of correlated sources down to their joint entropy , without explicit communication between the sources .",
    "this surprising existential result shows that it is enough for the sources to know the probability distribution of data generated .",
    "recent advances @xcite in distributed source coding allow us to take advantage of data correlation to reduce the number of bits that need to be transmitted , with concomitant savings in energy .",
    "however , finding the optimal rate allocation lying in slepian - wolf achievable rate region defined by @xmath2 constraints for @xmath3 nodes and designing efficient distributed source codes is a challenging problem .",
    "we simplify this problem by allowing the interaction between the base - station and the sensor nodes , and introducing the notion of _ instantaneous decoding _ @xcite .",
    "this reduces the rate allocation problem to the problem of finding the optimal scheduling order , albeit at some loss of optimality .",
    "two results in the theory of interactive communication provided further motivation for our work .",
    "first result states that even if the feedback does not help in increasing the capacity of a communication channel , it does help in reducing the complexity of communication @xcite .",
    "second result states that for the worst - case interactive communication , for almost all _ sparse pairs _ the recipient , who has nothing to say , must transmit almost all the bits in an optimal interactive communication protocol and informant transmits _ almost _ nothing @xcite .    based on these results ,",
    "this paper proposes a formalism that attempts to reduce the number of bits sent by a sensor node .",
    "the proposed formalism casts the problem of many sensor nodes communicating with a base - station as a problem where multiple informants with correlated information communicate with single recipient . here",
    "we identify the base - station as the recipient of the information and the sensor nodes as the sources of information .",
    "however , @xcite and subsequent papers @xcite consider only the interactive communication between a single informant - recipient pair , while in the sensor networks , we have as many informant - recipient pairs , as the number of sensor nodes . if the sensor data is assumed to be uncorrelated , then the results of @xcite can be trivially extended to the present scenario .",
    "however , in a data - gathering sensor network , the sensor data is supposed to be correlated .",
    "so , extending the results in @xcite to the scenarios where multiple informants with correlated information communicate with single recipient and then applying those results to the sensor networks , is not straightforward .",
    "formally , the problem is the following .",
    "there are @xmath3 sources of correlated information and there is one recipient of information @xmath4 , which needs to collect the information from these @xmath3 sources .",
    "assume that @xmath4 can interact with any of those @xmath3 sources , but among themselves these @xmath3 sources can not interact directly .",
    "at the end of communication , each of these @xmath3 sources need not know what other @xmath5 sources know .",
    "we are looking for the most efficient communication schemes ( ones which minimize the communication complexity ) for this problem . in the context of sensor networks , if the base - station knows the joint distribution of the sensor data or the correlations therein , then it can play some distributed version of the ` game of twenty questions ' with @xmath3 sensors to retrieve their information .",
    "if there is a single sensor node or if the sensor data are uncorrelated , then the base - station can ` play ' with individual sensor nodes and any node @xmath6 needs to send at least @xmath7 bits , where @xmath7 is the entropy of the information source at node @xmath6 .",
    "so , assuming the sensor data at all the nodes are _ identically distributed _",
    ", finally the base - station retrieves @xmath8 bits from the @xmath3 sensors .",
    "however , in a more realistic situation , the sensors have correlated data and the base - station needs to retrieve only @xmath9 bits . note that we can talk in terms of entropies only when we are concerned with average number of bits communicated .",
    "however , if we are interested in the worst - case number of bits , then it depends solely on the cardinality of the _ support set _ of the data of individual nodes than on the corresponding probabilities .    in this work , we make two simplifying assumptions : the sensor nodes communicate with the base - station in a single - hop and only the total number of bits exchanged between the sensor nodes and the base - station are considered and this is what we refer to as ` communication complexity ' .",
    "this paper shows that the communication complexity depends on the model of the spatial - correlation of the sensor data as well as on the order in which the sensor nodes communicate with the base - station . under the assumption of an omniscient base - station",
    ", the base - station can compute the optimal number of bits , which any node in any schedule needs to send to it for any spatial correlation model of the sensor data .",
    "however , a sensor node , even if it knows in how many bits it needs to send its information to the base - station , may not actually be able to compress its information to that many number of bits , without explicit knowledge of how its data is correlated with the data of the other nodes . in general",
    ", this is neither possible given the limited knowledge of the network that a sensor node is supposed to have , nor desirable given the limited energy and computational capabilities of the sensor nodes .",
    "an omnipotent base - station can take up the most of the burden of computation and communication , allowing the the sensor nodes to perform minimal computation and transmit minimal number of bits , hence conserving their precious energy reserves and possibly increasing their operational lifetime .",
    "in the section [ example ] , we give an example of the situation where multiple informants with correlated information communicate with single recipient .",
    "we use this example to illustrate the complexity of communication in such scenarios and various other fundamental issues and our results .",
    "section [ worst_case_theory ] develops the formalism to compute the worst - case communication complexity in the scenarios where multiple correlated informants communicate with a single recipient .",
    "section [ sensornet_appl ] illustrates some of the ideas proposed and developed in this paper in the context of a sensor network with one particular model of spatial correlation of sensor data .",
    "finally , the section [ conclusions ] lists the contributions of our work and concludes the paper .",
    "there are @xmath3 groups @xmath10 , and each group has @xmath11 teams . in every match , two teams from two different groups play against each other . the result of each match is announced over radio",
    ". matches always result in a clear winner .",
    "the format of the radio announcements is : `` today the teams from groups @xmath12 and @xmath13 played against each other .",
    "the match between teams @xmath6 and @xmath14 was won by team @xmath15 . ''",
    "three persons @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are involved .",
    "@xmath16 listens to the first part of the announcement `` today the teams from groups @xmath12 and @xmath13 played against each other . ''",
    "and then the radio is snatched by person @xmath17 , who listens to the portion `` the match between teams @xmath6 and @xmath14 was won by '' before the radio is snatched from him by @xmath18 , who listens to the portion `` team @xmath15 '' .",
    "now all three persons agree that @xmath16 must know which two teams played and who the winner was ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 need not learn which two teams from which two groups actually played and which one finally won ) .",
    "they want to find the most efficient way to do this .",
    "@xmath16 wants to know which two teams from the groups @xmath12 and @xmath13 played and which one actually won .",
    "suppose only @xmath17 communicates with @xmath16 , then @xmath16 will only know which two teams from the groups @xmath12 and @xmath13 actually played the match , but not the winner .",
    "on the other hand , if only @xmath18 communicates with @xmath16 , then @xmath16 knows the teams from which two groups played and who was the winner , but he may not know who the other team was . in this problem",
    ", it is essential that the identity of the group to which a team belongs to is included in the name of the team , that is , the names of the teams have to be globally unique .",
    "suppose on the contrary , that the names of the teams are only unique within a group , then two or more groups might have the the teams with the same name .",
    "so , in the event of a match between two teams from two different groups with the same name playing against each other , @xmath16 will not be able to make the winner out of the information sent to him by @xmath18 , even if @xmath17 has already informed @xmath16 of which two teams have played .",
    "so , we are demanding that once @xmath17 and @xmath18 have communicated all their information to @xmath16 , then @xmath16 must be able to unambiguously infer which two teams had played as well as who the winner was .",
    "the previous argument proves that this demand is satisfied if and only if the team names are globally unique .",
    "it should be noted that the total number of bits exchanged to complete the entire process of communication depends very much on the format of the announcement .",
    "for example , in the original problem in @xcite , if the format of the announcement is : `` the match between teams @xmath6 and @xmath14 is won by first / second team '' with the protocol that the ` first ' ( ` second ' ) corresponds to the first ( second ) team mentioned in the announcement . in such a situation , only one bit needs to be sent to @xmath17 , with or without interaction between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath17 sends @xmath19 bits to identify one of the groups and the team from it . after this message",
    ", it does not need to identify the second group as it is obvious to @xmath16 .",
    "so , @xmath17 needs to send another @xmath20 bits to enable @xmath16 know which is the team from the other group ( message 1 , 2 ) .",
    "@xmath18 sends @xmath21 bits to @xmath16 to help him know who the winner was ( message 3 ) .",
    "@xmath22      there are two scenarios here .",
    "one where @xmath17 communicates its information to @xmath16 before @xmath18 communicates with @xmath16 .",
    "the other scenario is the one where @xmath18 sends his information to @xmath16 before @xmath17 sends .",
    "we have to compute the number of bits exchanged for both the scenarios .",
    "* when @xmath17 communicates with @xmath16 before @xmath18 : * @xmath16 knows the two groups from which two teams played against each other .",
    "@xmath16 encodes in @xmath23 bits the names of the groups .",
    "so , @xmath16 sends in @xmath24 bits the first bit location at which the encodings of the two groups differ to @xmath17 ( message 1 ) .",
    "@xmath17 on its turn , sends the value of the first bit at which the encodings of two groups differ along with the @xmath20 bits to identify the team within one of the groups . to help identify the team from the other group it just needs to send @xmath20 bits to @xmath16 as the identity of the group to which this team belongs to",
    "is already known to @xmath16 by now ( message 2 , 3 , 4 ) . at the end of this step ,",
    "@xmath16 knows which two teams had played .",
    "so , now in @xmath25 bits it sends the identity of the first bit location at which the encodings of the two teams differ to @xmath18 ( message 5 ) and @xmath18 responds by sending the value of that bit ( message 6 ) . with this @xmath16",
    "can determine who the winner was .",
    "so under this scenario , the number of bits exchanged are : @xmath26    * when @xmath18 communicates with @xmath16 before @xmath17 : * @xmath16 sends in @xmath24 bits the location of the first bit at which the encodings of the two groups differ to @xmath18 ( message 1 ) .",
    "@xmath18 in its turn , sends the value of the bit at that location along with the encoding of the winning team in @xmath20 number of bits ( message 2 , 3 ) . at the end of this step",
    ", @xmath16 knows which was the winning team and to which group it belonged to too .",
    "so , all that @xmath16 does not know now is that which team from the other group also played in the match .",
    "it sends to @xmath17 the location and value of the first bit at which the encodings of two two teams differ in @xmath27 bits ( message 4 , 5 ) .",
    "@xmath17 then responds by sending @xmath20 number of bits to identify the team from the given group ( message 6 ) .",
    "so under this scenario , the number of bits exchanged are : @xmath28    note , , and show that if we consider , total number of bits exchanged in the entire communication or the total number of bits transmitted by persons @xmath17 and @xmath18 together , interaction helps in reducing the number of bits compared to when no interaction is allowed .",
    "further , when @xmath18 communicates with @xmath16 before @xmath17 , the number of exchanged bits are less than when @xmath17 communicates with @xmath16 before @xmath18 .    if we adopt the convention that all the messages sent by a source , until some other source sends the messages , form one message , then in all the above situations at most four messages are exchanged .",
    "so , in a communication protocol following this convention , the source concatenates all the messages that it sends before some other source begins to send the messages , and receiver knows how to parse the concatenated message into its individual messages .    as @xcite and the example above",
    "prove , the interaction reduces the number of bits exchanged between the informants and the recipient .",
    "however , from the above example , it also becomes clear that even for the given number of messages exchanged between the informants and the recipient , in general , the number of bits exchanged depends on the order in which the informants communicate with the recipient .",
    "so in the above example , with four messages allowed , the number of bits exchanged between @xmath29 , and @xmath18 depend on whether @xmath17 communicates with @xmath16 before @xmath18 or after .",
    "we conjecture that this is so due to `` somewhat '' asymmetric nature of the distribution of the information at the nodes @xmath17 and @xmath18 of this particular example and loosely , we can say that the messages from @xmath18 contain more information than those from @xmath17 .",
    "in this section we attempt to develop a theory of worst - case interactive communication . to keep the discussion simple and clear , we consider a general scenario involving two informants ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) and one recipient ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "however , the same formalism can be extended for the scenarios involving more than two informants . for the sake of completeness and to facilitate the discussion that follows , let us reintroduce the notion of _ ambiguity set _ and some related concepts , defined originally in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath30 be a random pair , with _ support set _ @xmath31 .",
    "the _ support set _ of @xmath32 is the set @xmath33 of possible @xmath32 values .",
    "@xmath34 , the _ support set _ of @xmath35 , is similarly defined .",
    "s _ ambiguity set _ when his random variable @xmath35 takes the value @xmath36 is @xmath37 the set of possible @xmath32 values when @xmath38 .",
    "ambiguity _ in that case is @xmath39 the number of possible @xmath32 values when @xmath40 .",
    "the _ maximum ambiguity _ of @xmath30 is @xmath41 the maximum number of @xmath32 values possible with any given @xmath35 value .",
    "assume that a total of @xmath42 messages are allowed , with @xmath0 messages per informant allowed to be exchanged between the informant and the recipient .",
    "there are two possible schedules in which the informants can communicate with the recipient : either @xmath17 communicates first with @xmath16 or @xmath18 communicates first . in the spirit of @xcite ,",
    "let us introduce some more definitions :    @xmath43 : @xmath42-message worst - case complexity of transmitting @xmath44 to a person who already knows @xmath32 , when @xmath35 communicates first .",
    "@xmath45 : @xmath42-message worst - case complexity of transmitting @xmath44 to a person who already knows @xmath32 , when @xmath46 communicates first .    using these definitions",
    ", we have : @xmath47    in general , @xmath48 .",
    "we omit the detailed proof for the sake of brevity . however , the league example of the previous section provides an example supporting the statement of the theorem .",
    "_ corollary : _ the unbounded interaction complexities satisfy @xmath49 .",
    "it is easy to prove the following trivial , but quite useful lower bounds on the unbounded interaction complexities .    for all ( x , y , z ) tuples",
    ", @xmath50 similar bounds exists for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "since empty messages are allowed , it is obvious that @xmath54 is a decreasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "this holds true for other complexities , such as @xmath55 etc too .",
    "this fact together with previous lemma implies that @xmath56 with similar bounds for @xmath55 , @xmath57 , and @xmath45 .",
    "we can use above results to find the communication complexity of the version of the league problem discussed in the previous section and arrive at the results of and .",
    "if we identify the sets @xmath58 , and @xmath46 appropriately , we can directly use the results from @xcite .",
    "for example , the relevant support sets @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , with @xmath63 are : @xmath64",
    "in this section , we apply the formalism developed in the previous sections to illustrate the computation of worst - case and average - case interactive communication complexities . we assume following spatial correlation model for the sensor data .",
    "let @xmath65 be the random variable representing the sampled sensor reading at node @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote the number of bits that the node @xmath6 has to send to the base - station .",
    "let us assume that each node @xmath6 has at most @xmath68 number of bits to send to the base - station , so @xmath69 .",
    "however , due to the spatial correlation among sensor readings , each sensor may send less than @xmath68 number of bits .",
    "let us define a data - correlation model as follows .",
    "let @xmath70 denote the distance between nodes @xmath6 and @xmath14 .",
    "let us define @xmath71 , the number of bits that the node @xmath6 has to send when the node @xmath14 has already sent its bits to the base - station , as follows : @xmath72    figure [ fig1 ] illustrates this for @xmath73 .",
    "it should be noted that when @xmath74 , the data of the nodes @xmath6 and @xmath14 differ in at most @xmath71 least significant bits .",
    "so , the node @xmath6 has to send , at most , @xmath75 least significant bits of its @xmath68 bit data",
    ".    from the definition above in , follows the symmetry of the conditional number of bits : @xmath76    however , the definition of the correlation model is not complete yet and we must give the expression for the number of bits transmitted by a node conditioned on more than one node already having transmitted their bits to the base - station .",
    "there are several ways in which this quantity can be defined , we choose the following definition : @xmath77    so , with this definition , the number of bits transmitted by any node in a schedule depends only on the node nearest to it among all the nodes already polled in the schedule .      for a given schedule @xmath78",
    ", first node @xmath79 transmits its @xmath68 bits to the base - station . the omniscient base - station based on its knowledge of the correlation model in as well as all the internode distances",
    ", knows that its _ maximum ambiguity _ about second node s data is @xmath80 , as @xmath80 bit - patterns are possible for the @xmath81 least - significant bits of @xmath82 s data .",
    "so , even if we allow unbounded interaction between the base - station and the node @xmath82 , it follows from the results of the previous section that at least @xmath81 bits are exchanged , even by the optimal communication protocol . however , here we are more concerned with demonstrating the reduction in the communication complexity due to the interaction between the sensor nodes and the base - station rather than with proposing the schemes which achieve the optimal lower bounds of the communication complexity .",
    "so , here we propose an _ almost optimal _",
    "protocol for the communication between the base - station and a sensor node .",
    "base - station informs the node @xmath82 in @xmath83 bits ( if @xmath84 , then the base - station sends one bit to the corresponding node ) to transmit @xmath81 least significant bits of its information and the sensor node @xmath82 responds by sending corresponding bits .",
    "note that if no interaction is allowed between the base - station and the sensor node , then the sensor node has to send @xmath68 bits to the base - station . continuing this process , the base - station queries all the @xmath3 nodes",
    "so , the worst - case communication complexity @xmath85 of schedule @xmath78 is the sum of the total number of bits sent by the base - station and the number of bits sent by the sensor - nodes , in the worst - case .",
    "it is given by : @xmath86    let @xmath87 be the set of all possible schedules .",
    "then optimally minimum value of @xmath85 is achieved for that schedule @xmath88 that solves the following optimization problem : @xmath89    given the definition of the correlation model in and , it is easy to see that the optimum schedule is generated by a greedy scheme that chooses the next node in the schedule ( from the set of the nodes not already scheduled ) to be that node that is nearest to the set of already scheduled nodes .      as noted above in the discussion of the correlation model of , the data of two correlated nodes @xmath6 and @xmath14 can differ in at most @xmath71 number of least significant bits . however , it is not necessary that it _ actually _ differs in those many bits .",
    "so , there can be the situations where even if the base - station has estimated that the node @xmath6 has to send @xmath71 number of its least - significant bits and communicated this to the node @xmath6 , the node @xmath6 s data differs from the the data of node @xmath14 in less than @xmath71 least - significant bits .",
    "in such situations , it is sufficient for the base - station to reconstruct the data of the node @xmath6 if the node @xmath6 sends only those bits where its data actually differs from that of node @xmath14 .    given the @xmath71 number of its least - significant bits that the node @xmath6 has to send to the base - station , there are @xmath90 possible bit - patterns , one out of which the node @xmath6 has to communicate to the base - station . assuming that the each of these @xmath90 bit - patterns are uniformly distributed with probability @xmath91 , then following the typical huffman - coding argument , the node @xmath6 can communicate its data to the base - station in at most @xmath71 bits on average .",
    "given a communication schedule @xmath78 , the first node in the schedule @xmath79 sends its @xmath68 bits to the base - station .",
    "based on this and the knowledge of the correlation model given in , the base - station informs the second node @xmath82 in @xmath83 bits to send its information in @xmath81 bits . assuming the uniform - distribution",
    ", the node @xmath82 sends the requested information in @xmath81 bits , in average . continuing this process , the base - station queries all the @xmath3 nodes .",
    "so , the average - case communication complexity @xmath92 of schedule @xmath78 is the sum of the total number of bits sent by the base - station and the number of bits sent , on average , by the sensor - nodes .",
    "it is given by : @xmath93    the optimal value of @xmath92 is achieved for that schedule @xmath88 that solves the following optimization problem : @xmath94    it is easy to see that , once again , the optimum schedule is generated by a greedy scheme that chooses the next node in the schedule to be that node that is nearest to the set of the nodes which are already scheduled .    _",
    "remark : _ comparing and , it may appear that the average - case performance of a schedule is no better than its worst - case performance , but it should be noted that the average - case analysis is done for the uniform distribution of the bit - patterns , that gives the maximum entropy . for any other distribution of the bit - patterns , the average communication complexity will be lesser than @xmath92 given by .",
    "this paper proposes a new framework , based on exploiting the redundancy induced by the spatio - temporal correlations in the sensor data and the reduction in communication complexity due to interaction , to reduce the total number of bits sent by the sensor nodes in a single - hop data - gathering sensor network .",
    "the proposed formalism views the problem of many sensor nodes communicating with the base - station as the problem of many informants with the correlated information communicating with single recipient .",
    "we extend various existing results on single informant - recipient pair communication to the present case .",
    "we show that such extensions lead to various non - trivial new results .",
    "finally , we apply this new framework to compute the worst - case and average - case communication complexities of a typical sensor network scenario and demonstrate the significance of our contribution .      1 .",
    "we show that interaction helps in reducing the communication complexity also in the scenarios where more than one informant are involved .",
    "2 .   we show that when the _ ambiguity _ is more than two , then no fixed number of messages are optimum .",
    "we show that for the scenarios involving more than one informant , the order in which the informants communicate with the recipient may determine the communication complexity .",
    "we conjecture that if the nodes which have ` more ' information communicate first , then this brings down the overall communication complexity .",
    "essentially , we need a metric to quantify the amount of information , but not in ` shannon - sense ' .",
    "we show that when multiple informants communicate with a recipient , the m - message complexity of communication between informant @xmath35 and recipient @xmath32 , can be computed by directly modifying the hypergraph @xmath95 based on the information provided by the previous informants in the communication schedule ."
