    "[ sec - intro ]    magnetic recording technologies are among the most important applications of permanent magnets today .",
    "a typical storage medium consists of fine magnetic particles suspended in an organic binder adhering to a polymer substrate . during the recording process",
    ", different regions of the medium are briefly exposed to strong magnetic fields , so that each grain is magnetized in the desired direction @xcite . each grain",
    "could thus in principle store one bit of data , so greater storage density could ideally be achieved by a medium containing many small grains than by one containing a few large grains . however , in order to serve as reliable storage devices , the grains must be capable of retaining their magnetizations for long periods of time in weaker , arbitrarily oriented ambient magnetic fields . since experiments show the existence of a particle size at which the magnetizations are most stable ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , there is a tradeoff between high storage capacity and long - term data integrity which must give rise to an optimum choice of grain size for any given material . during both recording and storage ,",
    "the relationship between the magnetic field , the size of the grain , and the lifetime of the magnetization opposed to the applied magnetic field is therefore of great technological interest .",
    "fine ferromagnetic grains have been studied for many years , but until recently such particles could be studied experimentally only in powders ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "this made it difficult to differentiate the statistical properties of single - grain switching from effects resulting from distributions in particle sizes , compositions , and local environments , or from interactions between grains .",
    "magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and lorentz microscopy ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) now provide means for overcoming the difficulties in resolving the magnetic properties of individual single - domain particles .",
    "the standard theory of magnetization reversal is a mean - field treatment due to nel @xcite and brown @xcite . in order to avoid an energy barrier due to exchange interactions between atomic moments with unlike orientations",
    ", nel - brown theory assumes uniform rotation of all the atomic moments in the system .",
    "the remaining barrier is caused by magnetic anisotropy @xcite , either intrinsic or shape - induced .",
    "anisotropy makes it energetically favorable for each atomic moment to be aligned along one or more `` easy '' axes .",
    "buckling , fanning , and curling are , like uniform rotation , theoretical relaxation processes with few degrees of freedom and global dynamics @xcite . in all of the above approaches , the lifetime @xmath0 of",
    "the magnetization increases exponentially with the particle volume , @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the spatial dimension , @xmath4 is the temperature in units of energy , and @xmath5 is the height of the free - energy density barrier to be crossed in the relaxation process .",
    "however , for highly anisotropic materials there exists an alternative mode of relaxation with a typically much shorter lifetime .",
    "small regions of the phase in which the magnetization is parallel to the applied magnetic field ( the `` stable '' phase ) are continuously created and destroyed by thermal fluctuations within the phase in which the magnetization is antiparallel to the field ( the `` metastable '' phase ) .",
    "as long as such a region ( henceforth referred to as a `` droplet '' ) is sufficiently small , the short - ranged exchange interaction with the surrounding metastable phase imposes a net free - energy penalty , and the droplet will , with high probability , shrink and vanish .",
    "should the droplet become larger than a critical size , however , this penalty will be less than the benefit obtained from orienting parallel to the magnetic field , and the droplet will with a high probability grow further , eventually consuming the grain .",
    "the nature of the metastable decay thus depends on the relative sizes of the grain , the critical droplet , the average distance between droplets , and the lattice constant , as discussed in detail , _",
    "e.g. _ , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "at this point we wish to emphasize the difference between a droplet and a domain .",
    "whereas they are both spatially continuous regions of uniform magnetization , a domain is an equilibrium feature whereas a droplet is a strictly non - equilibrium entity .",
    "a droplet may either grow or shrink , but it will not remain constant .",
    "all of the particles referred to in this paper are single - domain , which means that in equilibrium their magnetizations will be uniform , but as we shall see they may nevertheless decay through the nucleation and growth of droplets .",
    "because of its simplicity , the kinetic nearest - neighbor ising model has been extensively studied as a prototype for metastable dynamics ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , and references cited therein ) .",
    "in particular , square- and cubic - lattice ising systems with periodic boundary conditions have been used to study grain - size effects in ferroelectric switching @xcite .",
    "a related one - dimensional model has been used to study magnetization reversal in elongated ferromagnetic particles @xcite . in this article",
    "we use the kinetic ising model to estimate the switching field , @xmath6 at which magnetization reversal is thermally induced on experimental timescales for given temperatures and system sizes .",
    "( figure  [ fig : hsroad ] is a sketch of switching - field curves and the four regions of metastable decay for a typical metastable system with short - range interactions . )",
    "we also find explicit functional forms for what is actually observed in mfm experiments : the time- and field - dependent probability that a grain of given size remains unswitched .",
    "the organization of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "studies of systems with @xmath21 will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the selection of the ising model is equivalent to requiring that the anisotropy constant be much greater than any other microscopic energy scale in the system .",

    "our model systems more closely resemble ultrathin magnetic films than magnetic grains .",
    "a more realistic simulation of three - dimensional grains is planned for later study , but we emphasize that we expect that droplet theory applies to almost any spin model with high anisotropy .",
    "accordingly , equations are written in forms appropriate for arbitrary dimensionality @xmath3 , even though simulations are only carried out for @xmath22 .",

    "e.g. _  in refs .  @xcite . for the temperatures employed in this study , the equilibrium spontaneous magnetizations in zero field are close to unity , with @xmath30 .",

    "we use as an operational definition of the lifetime @xmath0 of the metastable phase the mean first - passage time to a cutoff magnetization @xmath33 : @xmath34 it has been observed @xcite that the qualitative results discussed below are not sensitive to the cutoff magnetization as long as it is sufficiently less than @xmath35 .",
