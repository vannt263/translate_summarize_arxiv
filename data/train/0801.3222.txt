    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with two light quark flavors has an approximate @xmath5 chiral symmetry which is spontaneously broken to its diagonal vector subgroup @xmath6 , leading to an isotriplet of pseudo - goldstone bosons , the pions .",
    "low - energy pion dynamics , particularly elastic pion - pion scattering , encodes useful information about the confining dynamics of the strong interactions .",
    "the standard technique to study pion dynamics at very low energies with effective field theories was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and systematized as an expansion in powers of momentum and quark masses in ref .",
    "this effective theory is known as chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath7pt ) .",

    "the physical observables are determined in terms of two parameters , the pion decay constant and the pion mass .",
    "if one goes beyond the lowest order , a number of low - energy constants ( lecs ) @xmath8 not fixed by symmetries must be included .",
    "these can be determined by fitting to experimental data ( for the best determination , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) or estimated by vector - meson dominance @xcite , but both methods have large uncertainties .    an alternative formulation of @xmath0 scattering can be obtained based only on axiomatic principles of quantum field theory , such as analyticity , unitarity , and crossing symmetry .",
    "this allows one to obtain relations between observable quantities that must hold , regardless of the theory used for the description of the phenomenon under study .",
    "of course , one of the usual benefits of an effective theory approach is that many of these principles are automatically satisfied by the scattering amplitudes computed using the effective theory . nevertheless , there is still useful information missing in the effective theory approach , and one obtains interesting results by studying the constraints imposed by axiomatic principles on the effective lagrangian .",
    "analyticity and unitarity can be exploited to write the well known dispersion relations for the scattering amplitudes .",
    "these , together with crossing symmetry , can be converted into positivity conditions on scattering amplitudes , which in turn can be combined with the @xmath7pt predictions to give bounds on the @xmath1 and @xmath2 lecs in the chiral lagrangian at order @xmath9 .",
    "two - flavor @xmath7pt was combined with axiomatic principles in ref  @xcite , which analyzed constraints on @xmath10 and @xmath11 partial - wave amplitudes in the framework of dispersion relations .",

    "we are insensitive to the quark mass and condensate , since these are lowest order quantities , and our analysis starts at @xmath12 . on the other hand , since our study relies on scattering amplitudes , we only make use of the chiral lagrangian when vector , axial - vector , and scalar sources are switched off ( one always needs the scalar source for giving masses to the pions )",
    ". in fact we can only give bounds for the @xmath12 lecs of operators containing only pion fields , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and so our results do not overlap with theirs .",
    "one of the most popular models used in the literature for the study of pion dynamics is the linear sigma model ( lsm ) , introduced in the sixties by gell - mann and levy  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is driven by a scalar particle @xmath13 acquiring a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value .",
    "the lsm lagrangian is renormalizable and thus has a reduced ( finite ) number of parameters compared with the most general chiral lagrangian .",
    "it shares the same symmetries as @xmath7pt but has an additional ( @xmath13 ) particle in its spectrum .",
    "if the @xmath13 mass is sufficiently greater than that of the pions , it can be formally integrated out of the action , leaving behind the @xmath7pt lagrangian , with all the low - energy constants having specific values which can be predicted in terms of the finite number of parameters of the lsm .",
    "the values for @xmath1 and @xmath2 predicted by the lsm do not satisfy the dispersion relation bounds for low values of the @xmath13 mass .",
    "we will demonstrate that the lsm is perfectly consistent with the dispersion relation bounds and that the apparent contradiction results because for low values of the @xmath13 mass , integrating out the @xmath13 is not valid , or equivalently , that higher order terms in the chiral expansion can not be neglected .",

    "in this section , we find the region of the mandelstam @xmath16 plane in which the @xmath0 scattering amplitude is analytic , and derive the corresponding dispersion relations . in a scattering process such as @xmath17 the ( nonindependent ) mandelstam variables are defined as @xmath18 reversing the order of the two final ( or initial ) states amounts to exchanging @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing a few properties of @xmath0 scattering . for further details",

    "the three pionic states can be labeled either by @xmath21 or by cartesian indices @xmath22 . both sets of states",
    "are linearly related between them and to the physical pion states : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the cartesian basis , and @xmath25 denotes the isospin basis states .",
    "isospin invariance implies that there are only three linearly independent scattering amplitudes in the @xmath26 channels , and crossing symmetry relates them to each other , so they can all be described by a single function of @xmath10 and @xmath19 . in the cartesian basis",

    "the isospin amplitudes in the different kinematic channels are also linearly related . for our present purposes ,",
    "we only need the relation with the crossed @xmath20-channel .",

    "since below threshold , the amplitude is real and analytic away from the real axis , it follows from the schwarz reflection principle that @xmath47 and hence @xmath48 .",
    "this means there must be a branch point at @xmath49 , and a discontinuity in the amplitude along the real axis for @xmath50 .",
    "we will choose the branch cut to run along the real @xmath10-axis , because as already explained , the other branch points due to higher mass thresholds ( _ e.g. _ four - pion state @xmath51 ) or singularities due to single - particle states ( e.g. @xmath52 exchange @xmath53 ) will lie along it .",
    "we conclude that our amplitude is nonanalytic for @xmath54 , regardless of the value of @xmath19 .",
