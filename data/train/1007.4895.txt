    "many engineering problems involve multi - scale gas flows , e.g. gas flows in micro / nano - fluidic devices @xcite . since the flow regions can be highly rarefied ( non - equilibrium ) , the conventional continuum theory becomes inappropriate .",
    "the rarefaction order of gas flows can be classified by the non - dimensional knudsen number , kn , defined as the ratio of the mean free path and the device characteristic length scale .",
    "the navier stokes equations with no - velocity - slip wall boundary condition are only appropriate in the hydrodynamic regime where @xmath0 . in the slip flow regime ( @xmath1 ) , or the transition flow regime ( @xmath2 ) , it is necessary to use kinetic methods , e.g. direct simulation monte carlo method ( dsmc ) method , to describe gas flows . although the kinetic methods including dsmc are able to simulate flow in the continuum or near - continuum regimes , the computational cost is often very expensive especially for low speed flows .",
    "therefore , kinetic - continuum hybrid methods are naturally employed to deal with mixed flow regimes in typical microfluidic devices operating with a range of knudsen numbers in different parts , i.e. , numerically efficient continuum approach will be employed for the continuum regimes and kinetic approach for the rarefied regimes(see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the two models are coupled by exchanging information over the hand - shakingregion or across an interface .    however , the kinetic - continuum coupling is not straightforward since two types of methods are based on different theoretical frameworks .",
    "while information transferring from the kinetic model to the continuum model is usually a well - defined process , the reverse process is more problematic @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to recover non - equilibrium information lost by the continuum solvers which is required by the kinetic method .",
    "although the kinetic model can provide necessary information for the continuum model , it can be computationally expensive @xcite . the statistical noise associated with the particle methods",
    "may also affect the accuracy and stability of the hybrid solver @xcite .",
    "to resolve these problems , we introduce a multiscale lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method to use lb models which are based on a same theoretical framework .    the lb method has been proven to be able to simulate hydrodynamic flows with only minimal number of discrete velocities ( e.g. , nine discrete velocities for a two - dimensional problem ) @xcite . for continuum problems , its applicability is ensured by the chapman - enskog expansion . due to its kinetic nature",
    ", the lb model has distinct advantages over other continuum computational methods , including easy implementation of multi - physical mechanisms and the boundary conditions for fluid / wall interactions .",
    "the lb method may also offer a flexible framework for rarefied flows , which has recently been demonstrated extensively @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the key to capturing the rarefaction effects is to choose appropriate discrete velocity sets .",
    "generally , a high - order lb model with larger discrete velocity set describes non - equilibrium effects better @xcite .",
    "in particular , high - order models with modest discrete velocity sets can already accurately capture non - equilibrium effects in rarefied flows over a range of knudsen numbers @xcite .",
    "since the lb method offers a solution for simulating gas flows ranging from continuum to rarefied , we can introduce a multiscale method to couple models based on the same lb framework .",
    "this can be accomplished by employing higher - order lb models for non - equilibrium flow regions and lower - order lb models for hydrodynamic flow regions .",
    "since the coupled lb models only differ in the chosen discrete velocities without loss of kinetic information at the coupling interface , the information exchange process can be simplified .",
    "in particular , non - equilibrium information can be retained in lower - order lb models , which resolves an intrinsic obstacle associated with kinetic - continuum hybrid methods .",
    "meanwhile , the lb model can still reserve some advantages of particle method while eliminating the statistical noise .",
    "historically , the lb method was developed from the lattice gas cellular automata .",
    "the purpose was to mimic the navier - stokes dynamics .",
    "however , it was revealed that its applicability should not be limited to the hydrodynamic level @xcite .",
    "there are different theoretical frameworks for lb models e.g. , entropic lb models @xcite . here , to demonstrate the coupling scheme , we will adopt commonly - used lb models based on the hermite expansion detailed in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , the proposed coupling approach can be equally applied to different lb models .",
    "the original bgk equation is given as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the distribution function , @xmath5 the phase velocity , @xmath6 the pressure , @xmath7 the body force and @xmath8 the gas viscosity .",
    "using the well - known chapman - enskog expansion , the collision frequency can be represented by the ratio of pressure and gas viscosity , which is convenient to obtain the knudsen number definition consistent with that of hydrodynamic models . without losing generality",
    ", one can define the following non - dimensional variables : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the macroscopic velocity , @xmath11 the gas constant , @xmath12 the gas temperature , @xmath13 the reference temperature , @xmath14 the spatial position and @xmath15 the characteristic length of the flow system .",
    "the symbol _ hat _ , which denotes a dimensionless value , will hereinafter be omitted .",
    "the knudsen number can be defined by using macroscopic properties as below : @xmath16 based on these non - dimensional variables , the non - dimensional form of the bgk equation becomes @xmath17 where the maxwell distribution in @xmath18-dimensional cartesian coordinates can be written as @xmath19.\\ ] ]    for solving eq.([bgk ] ) , the velocity space can be firstly discretized by projecting the distribution function onto a functional space spanned by the orthogonal hermite basis@xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath22th order hermite polynomial , and @xmath23 is the weight function , which are given by @xmath24 @xmath25 the coefficients @xmath26 are @xmath27 the equilibrium distribution should also be expanded as@xcite @xmath28 where the coefficient @xmath29 for the equilibrium distribution is @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , are the weights and abscissae of a gauss - hermite quadrature of degree @xmath34 respectively .",
    "therefore , the maxwell distribution is approximated by up to @xmath35 hermite polynomials .",
    "the body force term @xmath36 can also be approximated as@xcite    @xmath37    it was shown that eq.([bgk ] ) with the first - order hermite expansion is sufficient to capture the rarefaction effects for isothermal and incompressible flows@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the second order expansion has been proven to be able to model various navier - stokes level problems @xcite .",
    "therefore , the second order approximation of the equilibrium distribution and the body force will be used hereinafter , as given below : @xmath38 \\},\\ ] ] @xmath39 where @xmath12 should be unity for isothermal problems and @xmath40 is constant for incompressible problems .",
    "the discrete velocity set is revealed to be of upmost importance in determining model accuracy for rarefaction effects @xcite .",
    "for the navier - stokes level problems , several sets have been found to be applicable , e.g. , the well known d2q9 model for two - dimensional flows . to capture higher - order rarefaction effects , more discrete velocities are required .",
    "some modest discrete velocity sets were shown ( e.g. , d2q16 and d2q36 ) to be able to capture non - equilibrium effects for flows over a broad range of knudsen numbers@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , highly accurate discrete velocity set is required for the flows with large knudsen number .",
    "therefore , coupling high - order and low - order lb models can save computational costs without sacrificing simulation accuracy for gas flows with mixed knudsen numbers .",
    "discrete velocity sets can be obtained from several ways , see refs.@xcite .",
    "a direct method is utilizing the roots of hermite polynomials@xcite . in one - dimension ,",
    "the discrete velocities @xmath41 are just the roots of hermite polynomials , and its corresponding weights are determined by : @xmath42 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] for higher dimensions , the discrete velocity set can be constructed by using the `` production '' formulae @xcite .",
    "once the discrete velocity set is chosen , eq.([bgk ] ) can be discretized as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . therefore ,",
    "the lb equation , i.e. eq.([lbgk ] ) , is now obtained by discretizing eq.([bgk ] ) in the velocity space .",
    "the key to success of a coupling scheme is appropriate bi - directional extraction and transfer of information at the interface or hand - shaking region .",
    "since only lb models are used here , the extraction and transfer of information is in principle seamless .",
    "lower order lb models , _ in their applicable capacity _ , can also retain non - equilibrium information which is required by the higher - order models .",
    "for instance , the d2q16 model can already perform well for a range of knudsen numbers @xcite .",
    "the d2q9 model , which has been used for hydrodynamic simulations , may also capture some non - equilibrium effects @xcite .",
    "this is very different from the continuum methods in kinetic - continuum hybrid models where non - equilibrium information is lost .    to correctly transfer information across the interface between two lb models with different discrete velocities ,",
    "the interface can be treated as a virtual boundary .",
    "since a properly determined interface should be located at smooth regimes where lower - order models are valid , the relevant information can be obtained by using extrapolation and interpolation techniques .",
    "firstly , the related macroscopic quantities can be calculated by interpolation , so that the equilibrium part of boundary conditionsis able to be obtained by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution . for the non - equilibrium part of information , recall that not only higher - order but",
    "also lower - order lb models can produce accurate non - equilibrium information in the interface flow region .",
    "moreover , the information provided by two models should be completely same on the boundary . therefore , the non - equilibrium part of information on the boundaryfor the low - order and high - order lb models can be obtained via extrapolating information on the grids adjacent to the boundary .",
    "it is interesting to note that similar techniques have been used to construct the no - slip boundary condition for continuum problems @xcite .",

    "firstly , the macroscopic quantities related to the equilibrium distribution can be obtained simply by the linear interpolation , i.e. , @xmath54 where @xmath48 and @xmath47 are the interface neighboring grids ( see fig.[sketch ] ) . if necessary , the temperature can also be obtained similarly . with these quantities",

    "the required information can be transferred cross the interface .",
    "meanwhile , a first order extrapolation scheme is employed to supplement the information for the non - equilibrium part , i.e. , @xmath60    therefore , the general process of the present multiscale lb simulation starts from initialization to get all the necessary information , e.g. , the velocity field by utilizing either the lower - order or higher - order model .",
    "the next step is to decompose the computational domain and determine the coupling interface by choosing an appropriate switching criterion .",
    "the final step is to implement the multiscale computation with lower - order models for continuum or near - continuum regime , and higher - order models for more rarefied regimes .",
    "two models with different discrete velocity sets are coupled on the interface as described above .",
    "the second and third steps are repeated until the converged solutions are obtained .",
    "the determination of interface , i.e. , choosing an appropriate switching criterion ( also called breakdown parameters ) , is important to any coupling / hybrid strategy .",
    "several parameters have been proposed in literature , e.g. , the local knudsen number based on the local spatial gradients of hydrodynamic variables @xmath61 ( @xmath62 is the interested flow quantity , typically density , temperature or pressure ) @xcite , the bparameters @xmath63 ( @xmath64 is stress and @xmath65 , heat flux@xcite ) .",

    "to solve eq.([lbgk ] ) , various numerical schemes can be used .",
    "for instance , if the first - order upwind finite difference scheme is chosen , one can obtain the standard form of lb model , i.e. , the stream - collision mechanism .",
    "however , for some high - order lb models , the discrete velocity points do not coincide with the lattice points .",
    "one has to choose a numerical scheme to break the tie between the time step and the lattice spacing used in the standard lb simulation@xcite . as some discontinuities may occur at wall surface in the following simulations",
    ", we will employ the forward euler method for time discretization and the second - order total variation diminishing ( tvd ) scheme for space discretization along the grid ( see fig.[figgrid ] ) for eq.([lbgk])@xcite . according to the characteristics of problems",

    ", the distribution function in the ghost nodes are assumed to be identical to those on the corresponding wall nodes .",
    "the classic kramers problem is often used to assess model capability in capturing the flow characteristics in the knudsen layer ( up to a few mean free paths away from the wall ) . in this problem",

    "a constant shear rate is applied along the plate at @xmath98 . with this special setup",
    ", one can investigate the nonlinear knudsen layer in detail . to correctly predict this knudsen layer , a kinetic method is required .",

    "the maxwellian diffuse reflection boundary condition is employed for the fixed wall .",
    "the d2q36 lb model is used for the region near the plate ( up to @xmath101 from the wall ) and the d2q9 model for the other region .",
    "the results in fig.[krame ] show that the nonlinear velocity profile is captured well by the multiscale lb method .",
    "it indicates that the coupling process can effectively exchange information bi - directionally .              with a simple geometrical configure , couette flow represents many realistic shear dominant applications , e.g. reader heads of a hard - disc driver , micro turbines and gas bearings .",
    "moreover , couette flow is a theoretically well defined problem .",
    "therefore , it is generally used as a benchmark problem .",
    "particularly , its geometry is so simple that the coupling interface can be determined easily . as has been shown by fig.[lk ] , the bprofiles @xcite indicate that the flow regimes near the wall are highly rarefied and the discontinuities occur at the wall .",
    "so we can use higher - order lb models in the near - wall regions and lower - order models in the middle .",
    "therefore , the couette flow can serve as a benchmark problem for testing the coupling strategy .    in the following simulations ,",
    "the lower - order lb model will be employed for @xmath102 of the computational region in the middle and the higher - order model for the other regions adjacent to the walls .",
    "the upper and lower plates are set to be moving oppositely with the same velocity magnitude , and the diffuse boundary condition is used for gas / wall interactions .    in fig.[d0936 ] , it is clear that the d2q9 model is unable to describe the knudsen layer , which was also reported previously @xcite , while the m - d2q9 - 36 model can obtain satisfactory results with the global knudsen number up to @xmath103 . when the global knudsen number is larger than @xmath103 , the multiscale method starts to deviate more from the linearized bgk ( lbgk ) results",
    "this is not surprising since the knudsen layers overlap and rarefaction effect becomes important for the whole flow domain ( cf .",
    "fig.[lk ] ) .",
    "note , a typical navier - stokes and dsmc hybrid model usually become problematic when the knudsen number is over @xmath104 , e.g. , see fig.4 in ref.@xcite . to some extent , this indicates the advantage of coupling the kinetic - based lb models .",
    "as has been shown@xcite , various higher - order lb models can satisfy different requirement on model accuracy in terms of capturing high - order rarefaction effects .",
    "therefore , it is possible to choose lb models with appropriate discrete velocity sets according to the requirements of model accuracy and computational cost .",
    "for instance , although the d2q36 model is used for the regions near the wall in the above simulations , the d2q16 model may also be able to perform well for knudsen numbers up to 0.4 , see fig.[d0916 ] .",
    "therefore , there is some flexibility in choosing various - order lb models for the present multiscale method .              the oscillatory couette flows can mimic flows in many microfluidic devices containing oscillating parts .",
    "its setup consists of a stationary plate at @xmath105 and a moving plate at @xmath97 which oscillates harmonically in the lateral direction with velocity @xmath106 .",
    "this flow can be characterized by the stokes number @xmath107 which represents the balance between the unsteady and viscous effects .",
    "similar to the steady case , @xmath102 of the computational domain is computed with the lower - order lb model .",
    "the results will be compared to those of the variance - reduced ( vr ) particle simulations and the vr method is discussed in the ref.@xcite .",
    "fig.[osicu1 ] shows that both d2q9 and m - d2q9 - 36 models are valid in the hydrodynamic regime when the knudsen number is low ( kn=0.0178 ) .",
    "when the knudsen number increases and the flows are in the transition regime , figs.[osicu2 ] and [ osicu3 ] show that the d2q9 model along becomes inappropriate while the m - d2q9 - 36 model still performs well .",
    "this demonstrates that the present multiscale method can work well for the flows with various degree of rarefaction .",
    "the simulation results of the m - d2q16 - 36 model as presented in fig.[osicu4 ] further indicates the flexibility in choosing various - order lb models .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the computational performance of the multiscale method .",
    "we will test the computational performance of the d2q9 , d2q36 and multiscale models . for the m - d2q9 - 36 , @xmath108 of the flow region",
    "is computed by the d2q36 model and the rest is simulated by the d2q9 model .",
    "the simulations are run on a four - core pc ( intel core 2 quadq6600@2.4ghz ) without parallelization ( i.e. , only one core is utilized ) .",
    "the time required for each computational step is 0.114 ms for the m - d2q9 - 36 model , 0.250 ms for d2q36 model and 0.097 ms for d2q9 model respectively .",
    "therefore , the present multiscale approach can effectively reduce the computational costs for mixed - kn flows .",
    "similar to other hybrid methods , the performance of multiscale approach depends on how the computational domain is divided and calculated by the lower and higher order lb models . however , the lb framework can have some flexibility since various discrete velocity sets can be chosen to satisfy the requirement on model accuracy at the minimum computing cost .",
    "the details about how to choose appropriate lb models can be found in many references e.g. , refs.@xcite",
    "a multiscale lb method utilizing low - order and high - order lb models has been developed for gas flow simulation . as a hierarchy of lb models with various discrete velocity sets",
    "can be chosen , the multiscale method offers flexibility in designing coupling strategy to strike appropriate balance between model accuracy and computational efficiency .",
    "the present coupling process is simple by using interpolation and extrapolation processes .",
    "therefore , the difficulty associated with kinetic - continuum hybrid models which couple two different methods becomes amenable .",
    "furthermore , the present methodology can be extended to develop other kinetic - kinetic hybrid models e.g. using discrete velocity models .",
