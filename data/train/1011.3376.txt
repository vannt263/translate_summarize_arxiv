    "edge - colorings of graphs have long tradition .",
    "although the chromatic index of a graph with maximum degree @xmath4 is either equal to @xmath4 or @xmath6 ( vizing @xcite ) , it is hard to decide when one or the other value occurs .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that distinguishing between graphs whose chromatic index is @xmath4 or @xmath6 is np - hard ( holyer @xcite ) .",
    "this is true even for the special case when @xmath7 ( cubic and subcubic graphs ) .    two special parameters concerning vertex colorings of graphs under some additional constraints have received lots of attention .",
    "the first kind is that of an _ acyclic coloring _ ( see @xcite ) , where we ask not only that every color class is an independent vertex set but also that any two color classes induce an acyclic subgraph .",
    "the second kind is obtained when we request that any two color classes induce a star forest  this variant is called _ star coloring _ ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "these types of colorings give rise to the notions of the _ acyclic chromatic number _ and the _ star chromatic number _ of a graph , respectively .",
    "proper @xmath8-edge - coloring _ of a graph @xmath1 is a mapping @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a set ( of _ colors _ ) of cardinality @xmath8 , and for any two adjacent edges @xmath11 of @xmath1 , we have @xmath12 .",
    "a subgraph @xmath13 of @xmath1 is said to be _ bi - colored _",

    "star @xmath8-edge - coloring _ if there are neither bi - colored 4-cycles nor bi - colored paths of length 4 in @xmath1 ( by length of a path we mean its number of edges ) .",
    "the _ star chromatic index _ of @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath0 , is the smallest integer @xmath8 such that @xmath1 admits a star @xmath8-edge - coloring .",
    "note that the above definition of acyclic / star edge - coloring of a graph @xmath1 is equivalent with acyclic / star vertex coloring of the line - graph @xmath16 .",
    "if one considers the class of graphs @xmath17 of maximum degree at most @xmath4 , brooks theorem shows that the usual chromatic number is @xmath18 .",
    "the maximum acyclic chromatic number on @xmath17 is @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( alon , mcdiarmid , and reed @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum star chromatic number on @xmath17 is @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( fertin , raspaud , and reed @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast with the aforementioned @xmath23 behaviour in the class of all graphs of maximum degree @xmath4 , the acyclic chromatic index is linear in terms of the maximum degree .",
    "alon et al .",
    "@xcite proved that it is at most @xmath24 , and molloy and reed @xcite improved the upper bound to @xmath25 .",
    "one would expect a similar phenomenon to hold for star edge - colorings .",
    "however , the only previous work @xcite just improves the constant in the bound @xmath22 from vertex coloring .    in this paper",
    "we show a near - linear upper bound for the star chromatic index in terms of the maximum degree ( theorem [ thm : upperdelta ] ) .",
    "additionally , we provide some lower bounds ( theorem [ thm : lowerdelta ] ) and consider the special case of cubic graphs ( theorem [ thm : cubic ] ) .",
    "the proofs involve a variety of notions from other branches of mathematics and are therefore of certain independent interest .",
    "we shall first treat the special case of complete graphs .",
    "the study of their star chromatic index is motivated by the results presented in section [ sect:3 ] since they give rise to general upper bounds on the star chromatic index .",
    "[ thm : upperkn ] the star chromatic index of the complete graph @xmath27 satisfies @xmath28 in particular , for every @xmath29 there exists a constant @xmath30 such that @xmath31 for every @xmath32 .",

    "we will assume that the vertices of @xmath27 are exactly the elements of  @xmath33 , @xmath35 , and color the edge @xmath36 by color @xmath37 .",
    "obviously , this defines a proper edge - coloring .",
    "suppose that @xmath38 is a bi - colored path ( or bi - colored 4-cycle ) .",
    "by definition of the coloring we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 , implying @xmath41 .",
    "thus , if we ensured that the set @xmath33 does not contain any solution to @xmath42 with @xmath43 we would have found a star edge - coloring of @xmath27 .",
    "it is easy to see , that such triple @xmath44 forms a 3-term arithmetic progression ; luckily , a lot is known about sets without these progressions .",
    "we will use a construction due to elkin @xcite ( see also @xcite for a shorter exposition ) who has improved an earlier result of behrend @xcite . as shown by elkin @xcite",
    ", there is a set @xmath45 of cardinality at least @xmath46 such that @xmath33 contains no 3-term arithmetic progression .",
    "the defined coloring uses only colors @xmath47 ( possibly not all of them ) , thus we have shown that @xmath48 . we still need to get a bound on @xmath49 in terms of @xmath34 . in the following , @xmath50 are absolute constants .    for every @xmath51 we have @xmath52 since we also have @xmath53 for every @xmath51 , we may plug this in ( [ eq : a ] ) and use the fact that @xmath54 is a decreasing function of  @xmath49 for large @xmath49 to conclude that @xmath55 thus we get @xmath56 .",
    "one more round of this ` bootstrapping ' yields the desired inequality @xmath57    [ [ remark . ] ] remark .",

    "we have been unable , however , to find a set that would yield a better bound than that of theorem [ thm : upperkn ] .",
    "the purpose of this section is to present a way to find star edge - coloring of an arbitrary graph  @xmath1 , using a star edge - coloring of the complete graph @xmath27 with @xmath67 .",

    ", we find a @xmath68-frugal @xmath73-coloring @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "we assume the colors used by @xmath74 are the vertices of @xmath76 , so that the frugal coloring is @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath30 be a star edge - coloring of @xmath76 .",
    "a natural attempt is to color the edge @xmath78 of @xmath1 by @xmath79 .",
    "this coloring , however , may not even be proper : if a vertex @xmath80 has neighbours @xmath81 and @xmath82 of the same color , then the edges @xmath83 and @xmath84 will be of the same color . to resolve this , we shall produce another edge - coloring , with the aim to distinguish these edges ; then we will combine the two colorings .",
    "we define an auxiliary coloring @xmath85 of @xmath86 using @xmath87 colors .",
    "let us first set @xmath88 and define the induced subgraphs @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "for each pair @xmath90 we shall define the coloring @xmath85 on the edges of @xmath91 ; in the end this will define @xmath92 for every edge @xmath93 of @xmath1 . recall that the frugality of @xmath74 implies that the maximum degree in @xmath91 is at most @xmath68 .",
    "consequently , the maximum degree in the ( distance ) square of @xmath94 is at most @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , we can find a coloring of @xmath96 using @xmath87 colors so that no two edges of this graph have the same color , if their distance in the line graph is 1 or 2 .",
    "now we can define the desired star edge - coloring of @xmath1 : we color an edge @xmath78 by the pair @xmath97    first , we show this coloring is proper",
    ". consider adjacent ( distinct ) edges @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "if @xmath101 ( say ) , we put @xmath102 and notice that @xmath78 and @xmath84 are two adjacent edges of @xmath91 , hence the coloring @xmath85 distinguishes them .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath1 has no 4-path or cycle colored with two alternating colors .",
    "let us call such object simply a _ bad path _ ( considering @xmath103 as a closed path ) .",
    "suppose for a contradiction that the path @xmath104 is bad . by looking at the first coordinate of @xmath105 we observe that the @xmath30-color of the edges of the trail @xmath106 assumes either just one value or two alternating ones . as @xmath30 is a star edge - coloring of @xmath76 , this trail can not be a path ( nor a 4-cycle ) .",

    "as we saw in this section , an upper bound on the star chromatic index of @xmath27 yields a slightly weaker result for general bounded degree graphs .",
    "we wish to note that , if convenient , one may start with other special graphs in place of @xmath27 , in particular with @xmath111 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath112 ( if the vertices of @xmath111 are @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) then we color edges @xmath115 and @xmath116 using the color of the edge @xmath36 in @xmath27 , while each edge @xmath117 gets a unique color ) . on the other hand , a simple recursion yields an estimate @xmath118 from this it follows that if @xmath119 is @xmath120 ( or @xmath121 , @xmath122 , respectively ) then @xmath123 is @xmath124 ( or @xmath121 , @xmath122 , respectively ) .",
