    "galactic winds , driven by supernova - heated gas @xcite or agns @xcite , have been frequently observed in starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "they play a significant role in enriching the intergalactic medium with metals and suppressing the star formation and growth of super massive black holes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "they are an indispensable element in theoretical models of galaxy evolution , in which they provide the feedback mechanism that enables the models to reproduce galaxy scaling relations consistent with those observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "winds have also been invoked to explain a number of issues related to contemporary cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , defined to have @xmath2 ) are the late stages of a merger of two gas - rich galaxies , which may then form a qso ( sanders et al .",
    ". though rare at low redshift , their co - moving density increases rapidly at high redshift @xcite .",
    "they are hosts to intense starbursts and may dominate the star formation in the universe at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "detailed absorption - line studies of a large number of ulirgs have shown that winds are ubiquitous in these systems @xcite and may play a crucial role in their evolution .",
    "our current knowledge of ulirg winds , especially their geometry , is very limited .",
    "though previous studies of ulirgs have yielded valuable insights ( including velocity distributions , detection rates , and rough mass estimates ) , they give little or no information on the spatial variation of wind properties ( though see martin 2006 for a 1-dimensional study ) .",
    "previous work on estimating properties of ulirg winds assumed spherical symmetry of the wind with uniform velocity and density @xcite .",
    "since ulirg winds occur in merging systems that have more complicated dynamics than isolated disk galaxies , interaction between two galaxies can possibly affect the outflow .",
    "for example , @xcite found that winds are detected twice as often in ulirgs as in lirgs , which suggests that the ulirg winds may have a wider opening angle compared to winds from less luminous galaxies .",
    "if this is true , then a spherically symmetric wind model may be too simplistic to represent ulirg winds .    to gain a better understanding of ulirg winds , we obtained 2-d spectra of f10565 + 2448 with the integral field unit ( ifu ) on gemini north .",
    "outflows in our target have been studied with 1-d spectra . @xcite",
    "have studied the velocity variations in this galaxy via long - slit spectra , and @xcite estimated the mass , energy and momentum in the wind . using the ifu data we can : 1 )",
    "measure how extended the outflow is , 2 ) determine whether the basic model for a disk wind ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) applies to the late stage of galactic merger , 3 ) map the velocity structures of different phases of the outflow , and 4 ) refine estimates of the mass and energetics of the neutral phase , in which most of the mass likely resides .",
    "f10565 + 2448 is one of the nearest and brightest starburst ulirgs selected from the survey of @xcite , with z = 0.0431 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the co redshift measured by @xcite is consistent with the optical redshift measured by @xcite .",
    "it is classified as an galaxy by its spectral type @xcite .",
    "however , in a more recent study , @xcite classified it as a starburst - agn composite galaxy , and the agn contribution to infrared luminosity is estimated to be 10 - 20% @xcite .",
    "the outflow s absorption - lines structure in this galaxy shows spatial variation in long - slit spectra @xcite .",
    "an hst image shows that our target has three nuclei , and the one we observed is by far the most luminous .",
    "figure [ cont ] shows the hst image and a green box indicating the nucleus we observed .",
    "we observed this object with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) integral field unit ( ifu ) in two - slit mode using the b600 disperser centered on 6300  , which give us a wavelength range of @xmath5 with spectral resolution of 4.26 unbinned pixels ( roughly @xmath6 ) .",
    "each image covers a science field of @xmath7 , which at this redshift is about @xmath8 kpc , with 1000 lenslets .",
    "there were two dithering positions with offsets of 15 from the center in the east - west direction . with eight exposures of 1800 seconds each , a total of four hours worth of data was collected .",
    "seven frames were taken on the night of 2007 feb 12 ( ut ) and one was taken on 2007 jul 4 ( ut ) .",
    "the seeing was variable within the range of 10 - 13 .",
    "the data were reduced using the gemini iraf package ( version 1.8 ) following the standard steps : overscan subtraction , bias subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration , sky subtraction , flux calibration , and spectra extraction .",
    "the reduced 2-d images were assembled into a 3-d data cube with coordinates ( x , y , @xmath9 ) using the gfcube routine . for each data cube ,",
    "differential atmospheric refraction was corrected by shifting the image slices at each wavelength to keep the centroid of the nucleus constant . after centering and combining all the cubes , and then trimming off the uneven edges , the total science field that was used for analysis is @xmath10 or @xmath11 kpc .",
    "the original resolution of the images was 02 per pixel . to get better signal to noise",
    "we binned the data cube to 06 per pixel , and since this is smaller than the seeing , we did not lose significant spatial information .",
    "the final combined data cube was sliced into 143 1-d spectra that can be used by our absorption - line fitting routine .    in our final data cube , there appears to be a resolution offset between the two sides of the field of view . after working with the gemini helpdesk",
    ", we learned that there is a known resolution difference between the two pseudo - slits that is probably flexure dependent .",
    "since the reason for the offset is still unknown there is no standard procedure to fix the problem . after inspecting the reduced data",
    ", we determined that we can make a meaningful analysis without any correction .",
    "this resolution difference in the wavelength direction can be up to 10 km / s which could possibly affect our spectral fitting , however , we have checked the fitted parameters and found no clear systematic effects between the two pseudo slits .",
    "methods for analyzing superwinds using spectroscopy utilize both emission and absorption lines . however emission lines can be contaminated by light from star forming regions , and they have an observational degeneracy between infall and outflows .",
    "absorption lines have two advantages in the case of ulirgs .",
    "first , emission lines in ulirgs are dominated by rest - frame starburst component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the absorption - line rest - frame component is typically swamped by the outflow component @xcite .",
    "this is at least partly due to the different density dependence of emission and absorption - line strengths .",
    "infalls and outflows sources can also be easily distinguished for absorption lines , since an absorbing cloud has to be between the observer and the light source . in emission lines , on the other hand",
    ", blueshifted gas could be inflowing or outflowing , depending on the ( unknown ) geometry .",
    "@xcite developed software for detailed analysis of the outflows via fitting the na i d @xmath12  absorption lines . because of its low ionization energy , na i",
    "d probes the neutral gas , which carries significant amounts of mass and energy and is easily detectable in these galaxies .",
    "we used this software to analyze the properties of the wind in f10565 + 2448 .",
    "we use the fitting routine , nafit , developed by @xcite to analyze the na i d feature .",
    "this routine fits multiple velocity components to the na i d absorption lines by varying the covering factor , optical depth , line width ( or more specifically the doppler parameter b = @xmath13 = fwhm/ @xmath14 $ ] ) and central wavelength of each component , and minimizing @xmath15 using a levenberg - marquardt optimizer .    for each line , assuming a continuum level of unity , the intensity of the absorption line is given by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the covering factor , and @xmath18 is the optical depth . assuming a maxwellian velocity distribution , @xmath18 can be expressed as a gaussian :    @xmath19    where and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the central optical depth and central wavelength in the line and b is the width of the line . as the na i d",
    "feature is a doublet , and the ratio of the optical depth of the two lines is determined by atomic physics , the central optical depth of the stronger line is always twice that of the weaker line  i.e. , @xmath22 . at any particular wavelength ,",
    "@xmath23 where @xmath24 is given by equation [ tau ] for each line .",
    "we also assume an identical covering factor for both lines in a doublet . with this assumption , both optical depth and covering factor can be constrained simultaneously . for a detailed discussion on accounting for blended lines and overlapping absorbers ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we wrote a wrapper to this fitting software to fit all of our spectra automatically .",
    "starting at the center of the galaxy , where signal - to - noise is the highest , we step outward in a spiral pattern , using the output parameters of the previous fit as the initial guess for the next spectrum .",
    "fig [ snimg ] is a signal - to - noise map of the continuum near the na i d line , in units of s / n per unit spectral resolution element .",
    "the s / n is as high as 50 at the center of the nucleus and declines to as low as 2 or 3 at the edges of the fov .",
    "as shown in fig [ 12comp ] , at the continuum peak , the absorption line is best fitted by two velocity components .",
    "( note : each velocity component contains a pair of doublet lines ) .",
    "the one component fit can reproduce the basic shape of the line but leaves significant residuals .",
    "a two component fit lowered the residuals significantly , and three or more components over - constrains the fit .",
    "as we move outward to regions with lower signal - to - noise , we find spectra that can be fit by one component equally well as by two .",
    "however , switching between one and two component fits within the same data cube introduces artificial patterns to our velocity maps .",
    "therefore , we first perform two - component fits for all spectra ; we then visually inspect the fits and remove any components that have negligible contribution to the equivalent width of the line .",
    "examples of significant vs. insignificant components are shown in fig [ sigfit ] .",
    "some spectra show the he i @xmath25 emission line which appears immediately blueward of the na i absorption lines .",
    "we include this emission line in our fit , where necessary , to remove its effect on our absorption - line fitting . for most of the spectra ,",
    "however , the he i emission is weak enough that it blends in with the noise and can be safely ignored .",
    "figure [ hefit ] shows examples of he i line fitting .",
    "all parameters are allowed to vary freely during the fit .",
    "upper and lower limits of all parameters are the same for all spectra except for the central wavelength which is @xmath26   of the previous fit .",
    "the upper limit of the optical depth @xmath18 is set to 5 since our fits are insensitive to optical depths beyond that .",
    "the covering factor is constrained to be 0 to 1 . to ensure that we are not extracting velocity dispersion widths smaller than the spectral resolution , the lower limit of the doppler parameter is set to the spectroscopic resolution of @xmath27 km / s determined from the line width of the calibration lamp lines .",
    "the fitted velocity widths are typically well above this lower limit .",
    "it should also be noted that @xcite have shown that not de - convolving the instrumental resolution before the fitting does not change the result significantly . the upper limit of the velocity width is set to @xmath28 km / s and no spectra came close to exceeding this limit .    we have checked our monte carlo simulation outputs for possibilities of fitting degeneracies . since this step essentially fits slightly modified versions of the same spectrum 1000 times , degeneracies for any parameters should show up as a bimodal or more complicated distribution in the fitting results .",
    "we find that almost all of the fitted parameters show a roughly gaussian distribution .",
    "exceptions occur mostly for the lower s / n spectra around the edges that are later discarded anyway due to their low quality .",
    "we fit 5 emission lines ( [ oi ] 6300   and 6364 , h@xmath1 , and [ ] 6548   and 6583 ) using a suite of routines that simultaneously estimates the stellar continuum and fits all emission lines at once , with the widths and redshifts constrained to be the same for each emission line .",
    "the stellar continuum , minus emission lines , was estimated using the stellar synthesis models of @xcite .",
    "the emission lines were fit with two gaussians , one narrow and one broad ; the broad component was discarded near the edges of the data , where the signal - to - noise was too low .",
    "the emission - line fitting routines are described further in rupke et al .",

    "figure [ cont ] is the hst / acs two color image of our target , with f814w shown in red and f435w shown in green .",
    "the green box on the lower right nucleus indicates the gmos field of view , and the continuum image of our data is shown in the lower left .",
    "the continuum flux map of our target is integrated over 6400 - 6500  . as mentioned in section 2 ,",
    "the pixels are binned @xmath29 to get better signal to noise .",
    "the h@xmath1 flux map is shown in the top two panels of figure [ em_lines ] .",
    "we ve applied a global balmer - decrement - determined extinction correction to the fluxes , e(@xmath30 ) = 1.75 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath31 .",
    "for both components , the h@xmath1 flux peaks at the same pixel as the continuum flux map .",
    "the bottom two panels show the [ ] /h@xmath1 flux ratio map for both components . for the narrow component , the line ratio is fairly uniform and symmetric around the center and has an average value of  0.5 , consistent with star formation @xcite .",
    "away from the nucleus , however , the ratio increases .",
    "the broad component has a much wider range of line ratios and a peak of  1.8 appears in the south and northwest .",
    "using the h@xmath1 flux from the emission line fitting we can estimate a star formation rate ( sfr ) . integrating over the h@xmath1 flux map we obtained a total flux of f(h@xmath1 ) = 4.08 @xmath32 erg  s@xmath33@xmath34 . using ned wright s javascript cosmology calculator @xcite , assuming @xmath35 km s@xmath33mpc@xmath33 , @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    ", we get a luminosity distance of @xmath38 mpc , and therefore l(h@xmath1 ) = 1.7 @xmath39 erg / s .",
    "sfr can be estimated using the following equations @xcite :    @xmath40    @xmath41    the sfr estimated from l(h@xmath1 ) is about 136 @xmath42 yr@xmath33 , and 190 @xmath42 yr@xmath33 from @xmath43 .",
    "the sfr estimated from h@xmath1 flux is slightly smaller as expected since the extinction from @xcite is a lower limit .",
    "figure [ velmaps ] shows the velocity map of the na absorption lines and emission lines respectively .",
    "( note : since the signal to noise is very low at the edges of the fov , we did an additional @xmath44 binning at the four corners so we can constrain the parameters better .",
    "this only applies to the absorption - line maps and not the emission - line maps .",
    "this additional binning shows up as four large pixels , which are 9 times larger than the rest of the pixels , at the four corners of all the absorption - line velocity and velocity dispersion maps . )",
    "velocities are calculated with respect to a fixed redshfit of @xmath45 . the narrow emission line map , which we interpret as systemic , is blueshifted in the east and redshifted in the west and clearly shows rotation ( see section 5 for more discussion ) .",
    "the pa of the major axis according to @xcite , 100@xmath46 east of north , is plotted as red lines on the absorption - lines and narrow emission - line velocity maps as a reference .",
    "most of the northern half of the broad line emission map has values very close to systemic , but the southern half shows significant blue shifts .",
    "the absorption lines are separated into higher - outflow - velocity ( blue ) and lower - velocity ( red ) components .",
    "both components are generally blue shifted with respect to systemic and their velocity gradients are east - west oriented , roughly aligned with the major axis .        figure [ vdisp ] shows the velocity dispersion , or full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , maps of the emission and absorption lines respectively .",
    "both narrow and broad emission lines have a high velocity dispersion region in the southeast , roughly in the same region as the peak of [ ] /h@xmath1 .",
    "the red absorption component has a typical fwhm of roughly 200 km  s@xmath33 , while the bluer component has a higher typical fwhm at about 300 km  s@xmath33 .",
    "the systemic emission - line fwhm increases away from the nucleus from about 150 to 350 km  s@xmath33 .",
    "nafit calculates the error in each fitted parameter using monte carlo simulations described in detail in @xcite .",
    "errors in the velocities are 5 - 10 km s@xmath33 close to the center and remain @xmath47 30 km  s@xmath33 for most of the pixels , although for some pixels close to the edge the error can be @xmath48 50 km  s@xmath33 .",
    "fwhm errors start from @xmath47 10 km  s@xmath33 in the center , remain below 50 km  s@xmath33 for most pixels , and increase up to @xmath48 80 km  s@xmath33 around the edges .",
    "other than the random errors due to noise , the systematic effect between the two pseudo slits mentioned in   2 may also cause errors .",
    "the two pseudo slits are oriented north - south with respect to each other .",
    "judging from the images of the fitted parameters , we can see that there is no clear systematic offset in the north - south direction ( the direction of the systematic offset ) .",
    "the velocity gradient is oriented in the east - west direction , and from the arc lamp measurements we find that the resolution offset is small ( about 10 km  s@xmath33 ) compared to the velocity gradient observed .",
    "therefore we can safely conclude that any errors caused by the systematic offset have a negligible effect on our analysis .",
    "our target is known to be dusty and we can test whether the neutral gas absorption corresponds to the dust features .",
    "a map of the na i d line equivalent width is shown in the right panel of fig [ color_dust ] .",
    "the equivalent width shown here is the total equivalent width of both velocity components .",
    "a map of the dust features is shown in the sdss @xmath49 ratio map in left panel of fig [ color_dust ] .",
    "we are using @xmath49 ratio as a proxy for e(@xmath30 ) and assuming that the stellar population does not vary too much across the field of view .",
    "a lower @xmath49 ratio indicates a redder color and corresponds to the easily visible dust filaments in the high resolution hst image ( fig [ cont ] ) .",
    "the sdss @xmath50 and @xmath51 images are rotated and resampled to match the pa and resolution of our data .",
    "a pixel to pixel comparison plot of @xmath49 ratio and equivalent width images is shown in fig [ gi_eqw ] .",
    "the na i d line strength correlates well with the dust reddening .",
    "we compared our ifu data with the freshly analyzed long - slit observations of our target along a position angle of 53 degrees @xcite .",
    "the long slit data probe further from the nucleus , and show the presence of a neutral ( ionized ) wind up to @xmath52 ( 10 ) kpc from the nucleus , as well as regions of large line broadening and shock excitation that extend 10 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "this is consistent with similar results from @xcite along a pa of 109 degrees .",
    "quantities calculated from @xcite long - slit data , including outflow velocities , velocity dispersions , h@xmath1 fluxes , and [ ] /h@xmath1 ratios , agree with our measurements from the ifu data .",
    "the narrow line emission shows a clear rotation signature with blue shifted lines in the east and redshifted lines in the west , which is consistent with long - slit h@xmath1 observations by @xcite and @xcite . within errors ,",
    "this is also consistent with the co presented in @xcite .",
    "our velocities ranged from -122 to 35 km s@xmath33 , while @xcite measured -70 to 70 km s@xmath33 , relative to central velocity , in the molecular disk .",
    "in general , the narrow emission - line velocities follow the rotation of the molecular disk closely .",
    "the small velocity shift across the nucleus is consistent with the galaxy being almost face on in our line of sight ( downes & solomon 1998 estimated @xmath51 = 20 degrees ) .",
    "based on the velocity map , the outflow extends at least 6 kpc in diameter across the center of the galaxy , confirming previous results @xcite .",
    "according to the h@xmath1 and co flux distributions , the launching region of the wind is roughly the inner 1 kpc of the galaxy where the starburst and the molecular gas are concentrated . since the h@xmath1 flux peak is the same as the continuum peak , we define the launching region as the area within 1 kpc of the continuum peak .",
    "thus , the wind extends at least 2 kpc away from the source region in all directions ; this distance is a lower limit if we assume extensions along the line - of - sight .",
    "we see evidence of asymmetric outflow in the broad emission - line and absorption - line velocity maps as mentioned in the previous section . in principle , red shifted emission lines can be observed from wind receding on the opposite side , but they are not observed most likely due to dust obscuration , which is consistent with other ulirgs observations @xcite .",
    "the general pattern of the broad emission - line velocity clearly differs from that of the absorption lines .",
    "the broad emission lines only appear to be blue shifted in the southern region while the absorption lines are blue shifted all across the map .",
    "the warm ionized gas that produces the blue shifted emission lines we observed arises at boundaries between the wind fluid and ambient gas .",
    "though the relationship between velocities of absorbing - line clouds and line - emitting gas is not well known , previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested that they may have different velocity structures , which is consistent with our observations .",
    "the surprising result from the absorption - line velocity maps is that the velocity gradient is opposite to that of the systemic rotation and aligned with the major axis .",
    "in general , the narrow emission - line velocity map is blue shifted in the east and red shifted in the west .",
    "the outflow velocity maps are less blue shifted in the east and more blue shifted in the west .",
    "@xcite observed our target with a long slit going through the continuum peak of the nucleus we observed , and a pa of @xmath53 degrees .",
    "their data suggested that the velocity of the neutral outflow is roughly constant across the entire galaxy , which implies an outflow diverging from a central starburst and slowing down with increasing height to conserve angular momentum .",
    "however , in our observation we do see a significant velocity jump in the absorption lines .",
    "outflows with significant velocity shear along the major axis may be at a low scale height and therefore retain the rotation velocity of the host galaxy , but in this scenario the velocity gradient should be in the same direction as the systemic gradient while the velocity gradient we observed is in the opposite direction .",
    "one can compare the data to a simple toy model .",
    "consider a galactic wind which consists of a gas disk and central starburst from which the wind is launched , and an outflow that extends perpendicular to the disk and away from the center in a conical shape ( see , e.g. , martin 2006 for graphic illustrations ) .",
    "according to this model , an outflow that conserves angular momentum shows very little velocity gradient along the major axis , but may show a velocity jump along the minor axis if the galaxy is tilted with respect to the observer .",
    "we do not see a significant velocity gradient in the minor axis direction . however ,",
    "since the central disk is almost face on , a velocity gradient along the minor axis due to projection effects may not be detectable in our case .    in the context of this simple model",
    ", one could observe a major axis gradient if the entrained outflowing material maintained the rotation it had prior to entrainment .",
    "however , this is inconsistent with the fact that the observed gradient is opposite to disk rotation .",
    "we thus conclude that the simple model does not adequately explain our observations .",
    "a wind perpendicular to the central disk is still a possibility , but another ingredient is necessary to explain the major axis velocity gradient .",
    "another possible explanation of the observed outflow velocity is an uneven power source .",
    "if there is a stronger starburst in the west , and this is accelerating the wind at a faster rate , the wind may appear to be counter rotating with respect to the galaxy .",
    "but this explanation is inconsistent with the distribution of star formation ( h@xmath1 flux ) and the gas reservoir ( co flux ) , which are both centrally concentrated .",
    "our best explanation is that the velocity difference is caused by interaction between the wind and ambient gas .",
    "the broad emission component , with high velocity dispersion and [ ] /h@xmath1 ratio , is detected up to 2.5 kpc from the nucleus , indicating a widespread shocking of interstellar gas .",
    "@xcite found a broad emission - line component in m82 outflow with increasing line width away from the nucleus ; they attribute this to turbulence as the wind shocks and mixes with the surrounding gas .",
    "if our broad emission - line component is of the same nature , varying densities in the ambient gas may be the cause of velocity asymmetry .",
    "more evidence that indicates shocks caused by winds can be seen in the broad emission - line [ ] /h@xmath1 ratios which ranges from @xmath540.8 to @xmath542.0 .",
    "such high ratios can only be explained by high velocity shocks @xcite or an agn . since starburst dominates the luminosity in f10565 + 2448 @xcite , high velocity shocks are the most plausible explanation .",
    "previous work has used the correlation between ionization and velocity dispersion as evidence of shock induced ionization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our [ ] /h@xmath1 and velocity dispersion maps show that higher ionization corresponds to higher velocity dispersion ( bottom left panels of fig [ em_lines ] , [ vdisp ] ) , and supports a scenario in which outflowing gas interacts with and shocks the surrounding materials .",
    "variation of density in surrounding gas can be seen in a localized high ionization region found in the southeast of the broad emission line [ ] /h@xmath1 map ( fig [ em_lines ] ) .",
    "this region corresponds to a high velocity dispersion region for both the broad and narrow emission lines ( fig [ vdisp ] ) , which suggest that the gas density in that region is higher and shock induced ionization dominates the emission lines .",
    "since this region coincides with lower outflow velocities in its neutral phase , the higher density interstellar medium may be decelerating the outflow gas .",
    "@xcite showed that ulirg winds have wider opening angles ( @xmath55  steradians ) than lower luminosity galaxies based on the detection rate of winds in ulirgs , which is almost twice as high as in less luminous galaxies .",
    "the inconsistency between our outflow velocity maps and a basic disk wind model supports the hypothesis that the morphology of ulirg winds may be different from winds of disk galaxies .",
    "the asymmetry of the outflow velocity maps may be a result of disturbance in the ism due to merging .",
    "thus , a merger may affect the dynamics of the wind , causing it to deviate from a simple disk wind structure .",
    "the above discussion assumes that the outflowing material comes from the starbursting disk .",
    "it is possible that the outflow may be dominated by gas entrained outside of the disk , which may have a different velocity pattern due to the complex merger dynamics .",
    "for instance , the edges of our systemic velocity map show deviations from simple rotation .",
    "however , we show below that the outflowing gas mass is high , suggesting that an origin in the massive central gas reservoir is most plausible .",
    "furthermore , the outflow is dusty , implying that there is neutral , perhaps even molecular , gas in the wind , most likely originating in the dusty molecular disk .",
    "an outstanding issue in galactic wind research is the relationship of different phases of the wind to each other .",
    "ionized gas has sometimes been seen in outflow in concert with neutral gas in starburst - powered ulirg winds @xcite .",
    "globally , ulirg winds are also thought to be dusty , due to the strong positive correlation between equivalent width of the na i d line and e(b - v ) in lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "using our data , we can convincingly demonstrate that the ionized gas is outflowing on kiloparsec scales , with high velocities ( exceeding 600 km  s@xmath33 in some locations ) , large linewidths ( up to 600 km  s@xmath33 ) , and strong collisional excitation .",
    "@xcite have detected blueshifted ionized gas in ulirgs with agns using mid - infrared emission lines .",
    "we have shown that starburst ulirgs can also possess ionized outflows . as discussed in   5.1 , the correlation with",
    "the neutral gas is weak , however , suggesting that the relationship between the ionized and neutral gas is complex .",
    "observations of more resolved sources may be necessary to understand the physical link between the two .",
    "our data also show , for the first time , a strong spatial correlation between dust reddening and nai d equivalent width , again on kiloparsec scales .",
    "this robustly confirms the physical coincidence of the neutral gas and dust in these outflows . by inference",
    ", it also suggests that the filamentary dust features seen in hst images of f10565 + 2448 and other ulirgs are in many cases instances of outflowing dust and gas .",
    "this result raises again the tantalizing possibility that starburst- and agn - driven winds are responsible for removing the cocoon of dust around obscured agn in mergers .",
    "mid - infrared spectra of ulirgs reveal deeply - absorbed continua @xcite ; these large optical depths have been hypothesized to hide nascent quasars @xcite .",
    "outflows like the one observed in this source may be the mechanism by which this dust is removed and a quasar is born",
    ".      we can refine the estimation of mass and kinetic energy in the neutral wind using a wind model that depends on the physical parameter outputs of our fitting .",
    "we choose a spherical thin shell instantaneous outflow similar to the one used by @xcite .",
    "the difference is that @xcite assumed spherically symmetric velocity and density , but we have information on the spatial variations of these quantities .",
    "an alternative to the thin shell model is an outflow with finite thickness and velocity that depends on radius . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the thick shell outflow has @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the ( spherical ) radial distance from the nucleus and @xmath58 is the outflow velocity . because we observe the galaxy in a face - on orientation , we can not easily probe variations in velocity with @xmath57 , so we assume a single , characteristic value for @xmath57 but let @xmath58 vary across the outflowing shell according to the velocity output of nafit .",
    "we have de - projected the velocities from observed to purely radial velocities .",
    "the instantaneous mass outflow rate , average outflow rate and total mass are : @xmath59    @xmath60    @xmath61    where @xmath57 is the radius of the thin shell , theta and phi are the usual spherical angular coordinates , @xmath62 is the thickness of the shell ( @xmath63 ) , @xmath64 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath65 is the mass of a proton , and @xmath66 is the column density of hydrogen .",
    "for all our calculations we choose @xmath67 kpc to be consistent with @xcite , and @xmath68 . using the mass outflow rate",
    "we can calculate the energy and momenta outflow rates ( see rupke et al .",
    "2005b ) , the values are summarized in table [ outflowrates ] .",
    "the column density of hydrogen , n(h ) , can be estimated from n(nai ) given a metallicity and ionization fraction : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 = -5.69 $ ] which we set to solar value , and @xmath72 - log[n(na)/n(h)_{gas } ] = -0.95 $ ] is the assumed depletion .",
    "the values that we calculated for mass , energy , momentum and their outflow rates are within a factor of @xmath73 of the values in @xcite .",
    "the new mass , energy and momentum are smaller than what is predicted from long slit data , while the outflow rates are larger . with the new spatial information on velocity and column densities",
    ", the new values should be more accurate .",
    "the thin shell geometry that we assumed is , however , uncertain .",
    "theory and simulation predicts a thin shell of warm gas behind the forward shock of the wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is unclear whether it is accompanied by neutral gas .",
    "since we have limited information on the radial depth of the wind , we can not rule out a thick outflowing shell in which neutral clouds are continuously entrained in the wind . switching from a thin shell to thick shell model",
    "will decrease our measured mass .",
    "furthermore we are only considering the part of the wind where we have reliable spectral fitting ; the actual wind probably extends further than what we observed and carries more mass .    in some optically thick cases ,",
    "our fitting routine finds only a lower limit for @xmath18 for one of the velocity components , which is set to 5 in our fits .",
    "this is applicable to @xmath74% of the spectra used for this section s calculations , and may cause us to underestimate the mass .",
    "we check the extend of this effect by comparing our values to those calculated by using only one velocity component fit throughout .",
    "when only one component is used for fitting , only @xmath75% of the fitted @xmath18 used for calculation are at the lower limit .",
    "the estimated mass and energy are slightly smaller than , but within a factor of 2 of the values presented in table [ outflowrates ] . from the present data alone , we can not rule out the possibility that optically thick lines cause a significant underestimate of the mass in the wind . however , we believe it is more likely that our mass estimates are not biased in this way because : ( 1 ) the saturated components in the current data arise primarily at low signal - to - noise ; ( 2 ) the one - component fits , which have more sensitivity to the overall shape of the lines in the low s / n region did not give a drastically different mass estimate .",
    "higher s / n data will likely resolve this issue and better constrain the optical depths of each component .",
    "since our observation only trace the nai d clouds , it is possible that we underestimated the total mass of the wind by not considering the other phases .",
    "@xcite compared ratio of cold , neutral gas outflow rates to the expected mass injection rated from the hot gas created by supernovae .",
    "the ratios are found to be close to unity on average but it can vary from 0.001 to 10 for individual galaxies . on the other hand , theory suggests that the entrained clouds dominate the mass budget of the wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we suspect that the nai d clouds are the entrained gas @xcite .",
    "the conversion factor used to convert the neutral na column density to that of the total na has also been shown to be uncertain @xcite . however",
    ", the total mass in the cold gas can not be more than an order of magnitude larger than our calculated value , otherwise the mass ratio between cold and hot gas will be too large @xcite .    within the above constraints , the present data put on firmer footing the coarse mass outflow rates measured by @xcite .",
    "it is clear that these outflows are massive and energetic .",
    "the neutral outflow rate in this particular system is comparable to the star formation rate .",
    "however , this particular system has a higher outflow rate than the average value in ulirgs @xcite . further spatially resolved and multiphase observations are necessary to understand the exact relationship between mass outflow rate and star formation rate in galactic superwinds .",
