    "cooperation is a backbone of our existence as an extraordinary social species .",
    "it enables the joint pursuit of political objectives and the more prosaic foundations of everyday life  @xcite . yet",
    "how human cooperation is achieved and persist is still one of the main puzzles in science  @xcite .",
    "one reason is the lack of proper feedback between theory and experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , we are now in the fortunate days in which , new , larger scale experiments with human subjects are making possible to connect decades of theoretical discussion on human cooperation to the real phenomena  @xcite . those experiments are putting on solid grounds that when deciding whether to cooperate or not , humans do not always make choices that maximizes their personal payoffs , but they also respond to the cooperation they observe in a reciprocal manner and they are sensitive to the social norms ruling the situation they face  @xcite .    novel research on socio - ecological systems has shown that social norms , besides promoting cooperation , have also the effect of enhancing the resilience  @xcite of cooperative systems to social and environmental variability  @xcite .",
    "here resilience refers to the ability of the system to absorb changes and still persist  @xcite .",
    "these studies report that during times of institutional and ecological volatility , social norms facilitates the management of common resources like forests , water , fisheries , more than the action of formal institutions . notwithstanding its relevance ,",
    "the role of social norms in fostering the resilience of cooperative systems is to a large extent still unexplored .",
    "recently , increasing evidence indicate that living systems operate near critical points  @xcite , and that this could provide them with functional advantages  @xcite .",
    "far from criticality a system can be either too stable , which may favour maladaptive behaviours , or too uncoordinated with its members behaving essentially independent of each other . in both extremes",
    "the system as a whole is not very responsive to external changes , while around a critical point it is strongly correlated and highly sensitive to these changes .",
    "a novel perspective posits that criticality is the evolutionary stable outcome of a group of individuals equipped with mechanisms aimed at representing each other with fidelity , wherein the best possible trade - off between accuracy and flexibility is achieved  @xcite .",
    "these characteristics can increase the system s resilience by helping it respond to stimuli in a more efficient and coordinated manner .    here",
    "we build on experimental evidence and previous theoretical work to develop an analytically tractable model to explain how cooperation can be maintained despite its intrinsic fragility and enhance the resilience of human groups .",
    "individuals decision to cooperate or not is based on the balancing between selfish and prosocial motivations , and this feature is able to quantitatively reproduce findings from recent large scale experiments on cooperation with humans  @xcite with similar or higher accuracy than previous models  @xcite . inferring parameters from experimental data ,",
    "we show that decision rules that weight individuality and prosociality can poise the system near a critical point where its capacity to respond efficiently to changing and widely diverse external conditions can be maximized  @xcite .",
    "this result hence points to a feature of cooperative human groups that might account for their resilience to social and environmental variability .",
    "first , evidence shows that human strategic behaviour is based on a combination of model - free and model - based reinforcement learning algorithms @xcite , which are related to habits subjects acquired from past experiences and goals that subjects expect to achieve in the future , respectively . under some circumstances",
    "@xcite , carefully described in the supporting information of ref .",
    "@xcite , this can be captured by a simplified form of the so - called _ experience - weighted attraction _ ( ewa ) equations  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are , respectively , the probability and motivation or _ drive _ of agent @xmath3 to cooperate at round @xmath4 .",
    "when the parameter @xmath5 is large , agent @xmath3 tends to cooperate or defect , respectively , if her drive is positive or negative ; if her drive or @xmath6 itself are zero , she acts randomly .",
    "intermediate values of @xmath6 interpolate between these two extremes  rational optimization and random behaviour .",
    "the term @xmath7 in eq .",
    "is the difference in utilities resulting from the choice of either cooperate or defect . if @xmath8 agent @xmath3 s drive to cooperate increases ; if @xmath9 her drive decreases , while if @xmath10 it stays the same .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath11 describes memory loss : if @xmath12 the agent remembers only the previous round @xmath13 , while if @xmath14 she has cumulative information of the full history of play .",
    "the case of @xmath15 amounts to an exponential discount of utility over time .",
    "evidence also shows that social norms can help humans predict others behaviour and coordinate to reach cooperation  @xcite . in analogy with ref .",
    "@xcite , we therefore write the individual s utility difference @xmath16 in terms of an individual drive @xmath17 that models self - regarding motivations and a normative drive @xmath18 that models the motivation to comply with social norms to be described in more detail below .",
    "the impact of both types of incentives on collective social phenomena is scarcely explored  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 weights the relative influence of selfish and prosocial motivations on cooperative decision - making . it might be possible to control this parameter via reaction times  @xcite , although this is still under debate  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the situation where agents interact pairwise by playing a given two - player game with each neighbor in a social network  @xcite . in this case , we can write the individual drive for agent @xmath3 to cooperate in her interaction with her neighbor @xmath20 at round @xmath13 as @xmath21\\delta i_{d}}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath22 refers to the strategy played by agent @xmath20 at round @xmath13 , i.e. whether she cooperated @xmath23 or defected @xmath24 , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is @xmath3 s reward s payoff when both agents cooperate , @xmath28 is @xmath3 s punishment s payoff when both agents defect , @xmath29 is @xmath3 s sucker s payoff when @xmath3 cooperates and @xmath20 defects , and @xmath30 is @xmath3 s temptation s payoff when @xmath3 defects and @xmath20 cooperates .",
    "the total payoff received by an agent @xmath3 interacting with @xmath31 neighbors is given by the average over the payoffs obtained on each of the @xmath31 pairwise games she is involved in .",
    "so , the full individual drive of agent @xmath3 to cooperate at round @xmath13 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 stands for the set of neighbors of @xmath3 in the social network , and @xmath34 refers to the number of @xmath3 s peers who cooperate .",
    "this component is modelled in terms of conformity with social norms and is a function of how salient  @xcite the norm is perceived by agent @xmath3 at round @xmath13 , which depends on whether she complied with the norm herself and on how many of her peers also complied with it  @xcite .",
    "the normative drive is determined by two independent factors , weighted with parameters @xmath35 , and their interaction , weighted with parameter @xmath36 , i.e. ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath37 + w_o\\frac{n_i(t)}{k } + w_i s_i(t)\\frac{n_i(t)}{k}.\\ ] ] according to the first term , if agent @xmath3 complies with the norm , she will perceive it as more salient than if she violates it .",
    "this is justified by the fact that humans have a strong need to enhance their self - concepts by behaving consistently with their own beliefs and self - ascribed habits   @xcite .",
    "this human attitude to be consistent can also be explained as a desire to avoid ethical dissonance @xcite .",
    "the third term containing @xmath36 , disappears if the agent did not cooperate at round @xmath13 ( i.e. if @xmath38 ) ; while not present in ref .",
    "@xcite , this last term is introduced in this work to account for recent experimental observations that support the so - called _ moody conditional cooperation _",
    "( mcc ) rule , which assumes that in taking decisions individuals are responsive to the behavior of others but only if they have cooperated themselves  @xcite .",
    "the second term containing @xmath39 , instead , relaxes somehow the assumption behind the mcc rule that we just described by positing that individuals are always sensitive to what others do .      if the payoffs introduced in sec .",
    "[ s : di ] satisfy @xmath40 , we have the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) game ; furthermore @xmath41 for iterated pd games .",
    "the dilemma is the following : although the best individual choice for both is to defect , mutual cooperation yields a better payoff than mutual defection ( @xmath42 ) . the experiments that we analyze here",
    "correspond to the _ weak _ prisoner s dilemma game , where @xmath43  @xcite .    introducing eqs .  and   into eq .",
    "we get @xmath44 where we have dropped the index @xmath13 to include explicitly the dependence of @xmath45 on the strategies of the peers @xmath33 of agent @xmath3 at round @xmath13 , collectively denoted as @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , we have done @xmath49 , as it can be absorbed in the parameter @xmath19 , and @xmath43 .",

    "these regions are separated by surfaces of discontinuous transitions that terminate on a line of critical points ( appendix  [ s : phase ] ) . at these points systems",
    "have been shown to display a multitude of significant features , like large repertoire of dynamical responses , optimal transmission and storage of information and extreme sensitivity to external perturbations  @xcite . for completeness , in appendix  [ s:3 ]",
    "we show that a susceptibility , defined in terms of the response of the global cooperation @xmath51 to a change on a generic model parameter @xmath58 , e.g. @xmath59 , diverges when approaching a critical point ; this is a hallmark of criticality  @xcite .",
    "to estimate where human groups may locate in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : criticality ] , we extracted the model parameters from two recent experiments  @xcite that have the largest number ( i.e. over 600 ) of participants to date ( for details see appendix  [ s : inference ] ) ; we expect these to offer more robust statistics than similar but smaller experiments .",
    "the two experiments differ in that participants are placed either on an heterogeneous network or on a square lattice  @xcite .",
    "we focus on two major features of these experiments that can be reproduced by our model with comparable or higher accuracy than more complex models .",
    "one is the dynamics of the global cooperation level ( fig .",

    ": mcc ] we show how to eliminate the dependence on @xmath51 and @xmath13 under the assumption that the system observed in the laboratory has reached a stationary state , so that observations are well described by the long - term dynamics in eq .  .",
    "when the system is monostable and we neglect fluctuations altogether the general result described in appendix  [ s : mcc ] simplifies to @xmath64 where @xmath65 is given by dropping the agent index @xmath3 in eq .  , and @xmath66 , with @xmath67 being the only stable fixed point of eq .",
    "this result reflects that when the system is deterministic and monostable its long - term dynamics is independent of its history . when the system is bistable and we neglect fluctuations altogether , the probability @xmath68 is given instead by a convex combination of terms like the one on the right hand side of eq .  , one for each fixed point .",

    "the values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , extracted from experimental data  @xcite , constraint the values of the model parameters ( appendix  [ s : mcc ] ) .",
    "there is a further constraint : the dynamics of the global cooperation level should be consistent with experimental results ( fig .  [",

    "which is consistent with both the experiments and the linear approximation of eq .  .",
    "the analytically - tractable model presented here encapsulates a variety of empirical observations on human cooperative behavior : i ) individuals balance both selfish and prosocial considerations when deciding whether to cooperate or not  @xcite ; ii ) humans operate with both model - free and model based reinforcement learning  @xcite , although there is some evidence that model - free reinforcement learning could play a more relevant role  @xcite ; iii ) population structure does not significantly influence the cooperative outcome  @xcite ; iv ) the assumption of slow adaptation has also turned out to be consistent with the experiments here analyzed . despite its mean field nature , which is expected to work better for very large systems , the model accurately reproduces findings in experiments with a relatively small number of ( over 600 ) players .",
    "it is interesting that a model as simple as this can reproduce major features of experiments with entities as complex as humans .",
    "a new feature of cooperative human groups is revealed from the calibration of the model with available experimental data .",
    "indeed , we here provide experimental evidence that an interplay between selfishness and prosociality can induce signatures of criticality in human groups .",
    "the long - range correlations between pairs of human subjects associated to a critical point could help explain why human cooperation can be sustained despite its intrinsic fragility and enhance the resilience of human groups to external changes  @xcite .",
    "certainly , more robust theoretical and experimental work is needed to reach solid conclusions , e.g. by using machine learning techniques  @xcite that rely more on general principles and less on specific hypothesis , and by developing more controlled and larger - scale experiments .",
    "however , the increasing number of similar findings  @xcite supports the plausibility of our results . particularly , similar to ant groups",
    "@xcite , human groups appear to reach optimal coordination at a suitable trade - off between selfish and prosocial behaviour that poses the system near a critical point .",
    "experimental evidence suggests that the intrinsic value individuals give to cooperation is established in their brain s reward system , which involves a cognitive control system and a social cognition system  @xcite .",
    "the former engages in estimating benefits to the individual , while the latter gauges social information . in this way",
    ", cooperative decision making could balance both individual and social incentives in the search for the most valued outcome .",
    "our finding that an optimal balance of selfishness and prosociality can enhance the resilience of human groups suggests a way in which natural selection can favor these cognitive mechanisms , since more resilient systems have evolutionary advantages .",
    "an interesting question that arises is whether there may be a connection between the signatures of criticality observed here in a group of decision makers and those that have been observed in the brains powering the decision making itself  @xcite .",
    "how would humans tune to criticality ?",
    "an intriguing possibility is that humans implicitly build a model and adjust its parameters accordingly , similar in a sense to what we did here .",
    "model - based inference techniques apparently tend to produce parameter values that are close to a critical point  @xcite .",
    "model - based learning mechanisms in humans  @xcite could then influence their behaviour and drive human groups towards criticality  @xcite .",
    "human subjects hardly possess global structural information about their group , which may explain why the mean field model developed here is accurate enough , and ultimately why no significant impact of population structure on cooperative behaviour has been observed  @xcite . an alternative idea",
    "@xcite posits that biological groups can tune to criticality by growing until a suitable size .",
    "if so , it may be difficult to observe signatures of criticality in experimental setups with human groups of fixed size .",
    "here we work out the adaptation is slow when compared with the time scale at which individual actions change  @xcite .    to begin with , notice that introducing eq . into eq .",
    "the system dynamics can be fully specified in terms of the cooperation probability as @xmath72^{1-\\alpha}e^{-\\beta \\delta u_i(t)}}.\\ ] ] by replacing the stochastic term @xmath73 , which depends on the actual actions @xmath74 and @xmath46 of agent @xmath3 and her neighbors @xmath33 ( see eq .  ) , by its average value @xmath75 , which is obtained by changing each action @xmath76 by its corresponding average @xmath77 , we get the deterministic equation @xmath78^{1-\\alpha}e^{-\\beta \\overline{\\delta u_i}(t)}}.\\ ] ] more precisely @xmath79 where @xmath80 @xmath46 denotes the set of strategies of @xmath3 s peers , @xmath81^s[1-x_j(t)]^{1-s}$ ] is the probability that agent @xmath20 plays strategy @xmath61 and we have used the expression in eq .  .",
    "a way to justify this approach is assuming that the cooperation probability , or equivalently the drive in eq .  , changes slowly during a batch of about @xmath30 rounds  @xcite . for small values of @xmath30 , a linear noise correction to the deterministic equation give good results even for a number of players as small as two  @xcite .",
    "since we are interested here in games with hundreds of players and we are focusing exclusively on observed experimental features at the aggregate level , namely the global level of cooperation and the mcc rule , we take @xmath82 and neglect the noise altogether .",
    "this approach is expected to be better suited for games with a sufficient large number of agents and is not expected to necessarily described the initial transient regime in sufficient detail . as discussed in the main text , this approach can actually describe the major features of the largest experiment to date  @xcite with enough qualitative and quantitative detail .",
    "if @xmath11 and @xmath6 both vanish , the probability of cooperation remains constant .",
    "we will thus assume that @xmath83 and @xmath6 are small so that changes in the drive during a few rounds are not appreciable .",
    "the accumulated changes will then only become noticeable after each batch of @xmath30 rounds ; these can be written as @xmath84 here the sum is over the @xmath30 consecutive rounds that start at round @xmath13 .",
    "we can re - write eq .   as @xmath85 where @xmath86 , since @xmath11 is assumed small .    for large values of the batch size @xmath30",
    ", we can interpret the sum in the right hand side of eq . as a weighted time average .",
    "the weight is given by a discounting factor @xmath87 which decreases from @xmath88 to @xmath89 from the beginning ( @xmath90 ) to end ( @xmath91 ) of the batch , respectively .",
    "so , if we further assume that also @xmath92 is small , we can approximate such a sum by the ensemble average in eq .   calculated with the corresponding mixed strategies  @xcite .    replacing the last term in eq .   with the term defined in eq .   and writing everything in terms of a rescaled time @xmath93 and a rescaled drive @xmath94 and utility differences @xmath95 , we obtain @xmath96.\\ ] ]    following eqs .  and  , and the definitions @xmath93 and @xmath97",

    ".    in all the discussion so far the condition @xmath151 has played a central role .",
    "here we show in a more detailed way why this is the case .",
    "first , notice that the function @xmath124 in eq .   essentially contains a parabola given by the expression @xmath186 and transforms it by applying a hyperbolic tangent , a constant scaling , and a constant offset ( both equal to @xmath187 ) to it .",
    "the parameter @xmath125 defines the curvature of the parabola , while the parameters @xmath127 and @xmath126 define the minimum value it takes and where it takes it , respectively .",
    "these features remain qualitatively true for the graph of @xmath124 , except that now @xmath127 also influences its curvature .",
    "now , notice that the graph of the function @xmath124 in eq .   has the following properties ( see fig .",
    "[ f : proof ] ) :    property 1 : :    it is continuous and bounded , i.e. @xmath188 for    all @xmath51 .",
    "property 2 : :    it is symmetric around @xmath145 , where it takes its minimum    value , i.e. @xmath189 for    @xmath190 .",
    "property 3 : :    starting from @xmath145 and moving towards    @xmath191 ( respectively , @xmath192 , its _ slope _    monotonously increases ( respectively , decreases ) from zero up to a    certain point , where its second derivative    @xmath193 vanishes , and then starts decreasing    ( respectively , increasing ) until it asymptotically reaches zero again .",
    "in particular @xmath194 .",
    "property 4 : :    by varying @xmath126 it is translated horizontally but    otherwise its shape remains unchanged .",
    "in particular , this implies    that @xmath195 depends only on the difference    @xmath196 , as observed in eq .  .",
    "according to properties 1 and 4 , the graph of the function @xmath124 in eq .   can intersect with the graph of the identity function in any of its points , by choosing a proper value of @xmath126 ( see fig .",
    "[ f : proof ] ) .",
    "furthermore , due to properties 3 and 4 , we can always find a value of @xmath126 for which there is at least one stable fixed point , since the function @xmath124 always has points with slopes as close to zero as necessary .",
    "now , due to the continuity of @xmath124 , if there are only two stable fixed points , say @xmath155 and @xmath197 , then there is an unstable fixed point , say @xmath158 , such that @xmath198 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : proof]b ) . in this case , because of the shape of @xmath124 ( see fig .",
    "[ f : proof]b ) , the unstable fixed point @xmath158 and at least one of the two stable fixed points should be on the right side of @xmath126 , i.e. @xmath199 . following properties 1 and 3 , if there is an unstable fixed point @xmath158 such that @xmath200 , there must also be two points where the slope of @xmath124 is equal to one ; this is due to the fact that for @xmath191 we have @xmath201 and @xmath195 goes to zero for both @xmath202 and @xmath203 , furthermore , @xmath204 .",
    "hence , the existence of a point @xmath51 with @xmath205 signals also the existence of at least one value of the parameter @xmath126 for which there are two stable fixed points ( see fig . [",
    "f : proof]b ) .",

    "there is one stable fixed point .",

    "we have @xmath216 , so @xmath217 .",
    "arguably the most natural parameters to consider in our model are @xmath218 introduced in eq .  , which is in principle under the influence of the experimenter , and",
    "perhaps also @xmath19  @xcite ; these two parameters influence the effective parameters @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( see eqs .   and ) . since @xmath124 in eq .",
    "depends explicitly on the parameters @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 any change in a generic parameter @xmath58 that affects any of those three parameters would also affect @xmath124 . to be more specific ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 , are well - behaved functions of @xmath58 .    deriving both sides of eq .   with respect to a generic parameter @xmath58",
    "we obtain @xmath222 where @xmath223 is defined in eq .  , and the additional term @xmath224 takes into account the explicit dependence of @xmath124 on the parameters of the model , which vary when varying @xmath58 . the term defined in eq",

    "using eqs .   and  , we can write @xmath240 , which for small @xmath58 can be approximated as @xmath241 .",
    "so , following eq .  , when approaching the critical point , i.e. @xmath242 or @xmath243 , the susceptibility diverges as @xmath244{}\\:\\infty , % \\underset{a\\to a_c^\\ast}{\\rightarrow}\\infty,\\ ] ] where in the last expression we have written @xmath245 in terms of @xmath125 .",
    "the divergence of the susceptibility is one of the hallmarks of criticality  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the main text , experiments show that the probability for a human to cooperate in a generic round of the game depends on whether she cooperated or not and how many of her peers cooperated . here",
    "we explain how to connect this so - called moody conditional cooperation ( mcc ) rule with the mean field model described by eq . .",
    "indeed , the mcc rule can be expressed mathematically in terms of the conditional probability @xmath246 for a generic agent to cooperate ( c ) at round @xmath247 given that she played strategy @xmath61 and that @xmath62 of her peers cooperated at round @xmath13 .",
    "more precisely , the probability which the mcc rule refers to can be written as @xmath248 , where @xmath30 is the total number of rounds .",
    "we assume , however , that @xmath30 is sufficiently large and that the system reaches a stationary state . in this case",
    ", the mcc rule is given by the conditional probability corresponding to the stationary state ( @xmath249 ) , and we can drop the index @xmath13 ; we will keep the dependence on @xmath13 for the most part to facilitate the discussion , though .",
    "we further assume that the stationary state can be described by the long term dynamics of the mean field model .",
    "depending on the context , we will use interchangeably @xmath250c or @xmath251 to refer to cooperation , and similarly we will use interchangeably @xmath252 or @xmath253 to refer to defection .",
    "now , writing @xmath254 ( see eq .  ) , the right hand side of eq .",
    "gives the probability that an agent @xmath3 cooperates at round @xmath4 given that , at round @xmath13 , she played strategy @xmath74 , that @xmath255 of her peers cooperated , and that her cooperation probability was @xmath111 .",
    "indeed this is a more detailed reading of eq . .",
    "since in the mean field approximation we are interested in a representative agent , we can drop the indexes and write @xmath256 where @xmath257 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "this conditional probability distribution depends on @xmath51 , while the mcc rule does not .",
    "informally , if we assume that the system is mono - stable we can get rid of the dependence on @xmath51 to obtain @xmath258 where @xmath259 , and @xmath155 is the only stable fixed point ; eq",

    "@xmath269 is the conditional probability that the representative agent play strategy @xmath61 and her peers play strategies @xmath270 , _ jointly _ , at round @xmath13 given that the probability for the representative agent to cooperate at the same round is @xmath51 .",
    "the definition of conditional probability and the chain rule allow us to write    @xmath271    where the term inside the integral in the numerator is the joint probability that at round @xmath13 the representative agent and her neighbors play strategies @xmath61 and @xmath270 and their cooperation probabilities are @xmath51 and @xmath272 , respectively .",
    "the integral marginalizes this probability over @xmath272 leaving the joint probability of the variables @xmath61 , @xmath270 , and @xmath51 .",
    "although the next sentence may be redundant , its sole intention is to put everything in the formalism we are describing here : the probability that an agent plays strategy @xmath61 at round @xmath13 , given that the probability to cooperate at the same round @xmath13 is @xmath51 , can be written as @xmath273 .",
    "furthermore , at each round each agent picks her strategy independently of the rest .",
    "so @xmath274 this reflects the fact that correlations in the system come only through the correlations in the cooperation probability accumulated during the history of play .",
    "equation ( [ e : pssnx ] ) can then be written as    @xmath275    only now we resort to the mean field approximation which neglects correlations altogether to write @xmath276 . since we are interested in the stationary state , we can drop the round index @xmath13 in the expressions that follow .",
    "so @xmath277 where @xmath278 is the average probability that a neighbor cooperates , which equals the average probability that the representative agent cooperates since we are working within a mean field approximation .",

    "<S> cooperation among humans is crucial for overcoming some of the most pressing social challenges of our time like climate change , financial crises , and over exploitation of natural resources . </S>",
    "<S> while several mechanisms of self - governance for supporting cooperation , such as peer punishment , reciprocity , and social norms have been extensively explored , the impact of cooperation on the ability of human groups to absorb changes and still persist , their resilience , has received less attention . here </S>",
    "<S> we develop an analytically - tractable model that incorporates both selfish and prosocial aspects as constituents of cooperative decision making , which quantitatively reproduce findings from recent large scale experiments on cooperation with humans . </S>",
    "<S> the model parameters inferred from experimental data are near a line of critical points , which suggests a way in which cooperation can be sustained and impact the resilience of human groups to external variability . </S>"
