    "the advent of the lhcb and its unexpectedly successful contribution to hadron physics has provided this area with a plethora of new reactions that have stirred a revival of hadron studies .",
    "thus in lhcb , belle , besiii and other facilities , new reactions and decays of heavy hadrons have come under experimental study  @xcite , which has triggered a large theoretical activity as well  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath14 reaction was studied theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite and mass distributions associated to the production of the @xmath15 in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 spectra were predicted . in particular , the calculated @xmath16 distribution was in good agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "furthermore , this information , together with predictions made for hidden charm states of @xmath18 molecular nature in refs .",
    "@xcite prompted a likely explanation in ref .",
    "@xcite for the narrow state found in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also related works along the same line in refs .",
    "work has followed in ref .",
    "@xcite with the study of the @xmath19 decay , suggesting that a strange hidden charm state also predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite could be seen in the @xmath20 mass distribution .",
    "interestingly , in ref .",
    "@xcite the lhcb collaboration had also observed a peak at about the same mass in the @xmath13 mass distribution of the @xmath21 reaction , for which no comment was done in that paper nor in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see @xcite for further comments ) . a work along the same lines as @xcite was done for this latter reaction in ref .",

    "very recently , a reanalysis of the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite has been done by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite , concluding that the peak observed in ref .",
    "@xcite is indeed consistent with the claims of two states made in refs .",
    "the strange hidden charm state of @xcite was also suggested to be searched for in the @xmath22 mass distribution in the @xmath23 reaction in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the @xmath24 reaction in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the @xmath25 in ref .",
    "discussions on these and other reactions can be seen in refs  @xcite .",
    "the search for pentaquark states is not the only relevant information obtained from these reactions . indeed , one of the interesting findings in ref .",
    "@xcite was that the reaction , @xmath26 , acted as a filter for @xmath27 baryon states , which was later confirmed by the analysis of @xcite , where only the @xmath28 states were seen in the @xmath29 mass distribution .",
    "this was used @xcite to make predictions for the shape of the @xmath15 in the @xmath17 mass distribution .",
    "similarly , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the @xmath30 decay was a good filter for baryons with @xmath31 and , indeed , one can see in the experiment that there is no trace for the @xmath32 which otherwise is present with large strength in most pionic reactions .",
    "this filtering of quantum numbers , in spite of the weak interaction not conserving isospin , is tied to rules selecting cabibbo favored reactions and to dynamical mechanisms that leave the light quarks of the @xmath33 as spectators in the reaction .",
    "these filters make these decays particularly suitable to study baryon resonances that in most reactions appear together with contributions of other isospin channels . taking advantage of this interesting property the @xmath34",
    "was suggested  @xcite as a tool to investigate the @xmath35 interaction in the @xmath27 sector . in a similar way , in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath36 was studied and shown to be also a good filter for @xmath27 baryon states , allowing one to see the @xmath15 and @xmath37 resonances .    in the present work ,",
    "we take advantage of these ideas and study the @xmath38 reactions , showing that they provide a good filter for @xmath31 , @xmath5 resonances , which thus can be used to learn more about the @xmath6 and @xmath7 resonances .",
    "the @xmath6 is cataloged in the pdg with only one star and its spin and parity are unknown  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 appears there with three stars but its spin - parity quantum numbers are also undetermined .",
    "this latter resonance is , on the other hand , located quite close to the @xmath39 threshold , and thus the influence of this threshold on the nature of the @xmath7 deserves further study .",
    "we shall also see that the @xmath38 decay filters the spin and parity of the final @xmath4 pair , and hence the observation of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 states in this reaction might allow to determine the unknown spin and parity of these resonances .",
    "although the number of @xmath40 states should be comparable with that of nucleon resonances from the viewpoint of quark models , at present , the number of measured @xmath40 states is significantly smaller  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of @xmath40 resonances is relevant in connection with the underlying baryon structure .",
    "the assignment of the spin - parity , @xmath41 , in most of the known @xmath40 resonances is also incomplete , and thus these quantum - numbers have been determined only for few of them : the ground octet @xmath42 and decuplet @xmath43 states and the excited @xmath44 resonance .",
    "the @xmath7 is a pdg three - star state , with @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 represent the mass and the width respectively .",

    "the @xmath7 was dynamically generated in refs .",
    "@xcite , and it turned to have a quite small width of only around few mev . in these schemes , the @xmath7 would have spin - parity @xmath9 and it would strongly couple to @xmath12 and @xmath55 , having thus large molecular components  @xcite . however , this state did not appear in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors suggested that the @xmath7 might not be a molecular state . in all the chiral unitary approaches  @xcite the @xmath6",
    "is also generated , with a relatively large decay width .",

    "the experimental evidence for the @xmath6 is quite poor , and the pdg assigns to this state only one - star  @xcite .",
    "considering such situation , the analysis of these @xmath40 resonances is interesting , and important for the search of exotic states , which are not easily accommodated as three - body quark states . in this work , to study @xmath7 and @xmath6 we analyze the @xmath56 decay ( @xmath46 and @xmath57 represent the meson and baryon respectively , with the index @xmath58 denoting the meson - baryon channel ) . to account for the final meson - baryon interaction ,",

    "furthermore , if we choose the @xmath67 reaction instead of the @xmath68 decay , the @xmath69 pair must be in an isospin @xmath70 state , since its third component is @xmath71 .",

    "in contrast , in the mechanism of fig .  [",
    "fig : xic_decay ] all the colors are allowed in the @xmath75-vertex . on the other hand , the @xmath82 and @xmath83 quarks in the @xmath0 form a strongly correlated antisymmetric diquark configuration difficult to separate .",
    "therefore , a mechanism where the diquark state is destroyed like that depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : xic_decay2 ] is expected to be suppressed .",

    "[ fig : xic_decay ] since we will be interested in situations where the outgoing @xmath4 pair is produced at low invariant masses ( see fig .",

    "for all the above arguments , we think the mechanism depicted in fig .  [",

    "we have studied the @xmath152 decay process as a tool to study @xmath40 resonances , such as the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath153-@xmath63 dalitz plot shows the @xmath154 decay is not affected by the presence of resonances , in sharp contrast to the @xmath60 decay , where the @xmath62 in the @xmath65 channel considerably complicates the @xmath40-resonance analysis .",
    "taking into account cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix and color suppressions , diquark correlations and kinematical restrictions , we have proposed a dominant mechanism ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xic_decay ] ) to describe the @xmath0 decays .",
    "this mechanism determines the relative fractions of the intermediate meson - baryon states , while the final @xmath4 state interaction has been incorporated and studied using three different chiral unitary approaches .",
    "thus , we have predicted @xmath4 invariant mass distributions in the three chiral schemes .",
    "we have seen that the @xmath0 decay is not adequate to study the @xmath6 resonance because the open channel @xmath10 is not produced a tree level , and the other possible channels are closed .",
    "however , the @xmath7 peak can be clearly seen in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 mass distributions .",
    "we have further analyzed the peak around the @xmath7 energy region , because it could be produced by a pole , either in the second riemann sheet or in a non - physical riemann sheet , or it might be just a threshold effect .",
    "we have shown that the ratios of the decay fractions around the expected position of the @xmath7 resonance might be used to distinguish one situation from the another one . comparing the several models for the final - state interaction , we have found that if the @xmath7 pole exists below the @xmath155 threshold , the @xmath140 decay fraction will largely exceed the @xmath125 one , as a consequence of the quite narrow decay width of the resonance .",
    "on the other hand , if the pole is not placed in the srs , defined by continuity with the physical sheet in the real axis , the @xmath140 fraction becomes quite small and the @xmath125 mode turns out to be dominant .",
    "the above results are based on the mechanism shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xic_decay ] .",
    "however , there exist other quark - line diagrams where the high energy momentum @xmath1 is emitted after the @xmath77 creation , which might provide also a sizable contribution .",
    "we have estimated their contribution , and found that the neglected diagrams only alter the overall height of the spectra .",
