    "natural disasters @xcite have occured since earliest times , and despite the development of science and technology , they still cause many victims each year .",
    "one reason for this is the increased world population .",
    "nowadays , more people can be affected by a disaster than in former centuries . apart from this",
    ", more people affect their environment , which challenges its stability and triggers disasters such as famines .",
    "one common feature of many disastrous events is the so - called domino or avalanche effect .",
    "it means , that one critical situation triggers another one and so one , so that the situation worsens even more .",
    "one famous example is a mountain slide that fell into a lake and caused very high waves ( vajont , italy 1963 @xcite ) .",
    "other examples are fires and failures of water and electricity supply caused by earthquakes or , on a larger timescale , a disease harming the economy and social life of the affected area , which leaves the people and country even poorer and the medical system less effective , causing further fatalities ( e.g. aids in central afrika @xcite or the plague in former ages ) .",
    "therefore , a great effort is necessary to prevent the emergence of disasters ( which is not always possible ) and to improve the management of catastrophes .",
    "physics and other natural scientists have traditionally contributed a lot to understanding the laws behind catastrophes .",
    "for example , we mention the extensive work on forest fires @xcite and earthquakes @xcite , which relate to concepts of self - organized criticality used to describe avalanche effects @xcite . but there is also work on floodings @xcite , landslides @xcite , and volcanos @xcite .",
    "a considerably attention has also been devoted to epidemics @xcite .",
    "some of the physical disciplines involved into the study of these subjects are the theory of catastrophes and bifurcations @xcite , non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite , self - organized criticality and scaling laws @xcite , percolation theory @xcite , the statistical physics of networks @xcite and extreme events @xcite , stochastic processes @xcite and noise - induced transitions @xcite , but mechanics , fluid - dynamics , and other fields play an important role as well @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we like to develop a flexible semi - quantitative method allowing    * to assess the suitability of alternative measures of emergency management , i.e. to give decision support , * to estimate the temporary development of catastrophes , and * to give hints when to take certain actions in an anticipatory way .    for that purpose , it is necessary to take into account all factors which are relevant during the catastrophe and all direct and indirect interactions between them .",
    "this method is in the tradition of systems theory @xcite .",
    "it extends the concept of the causality diagram in sec .",
    "[ kausal ] , while a dynamical generalization is developed in sec .",
    "[ dyn ] .    in the next section ,",
    "we start with a static analysis of interaction networks .",
    "section  [ ex ] is intended to illustrate its usefulness for disaster management .",
    "there , we will calculate in a semi - fictious example the effects of measures taken to combat an epidemic catastrophe .",
    "section  [ dyn ] contains the extension to a dynamic description , which is connected to the discrete master equation @xcite .",
    "it allows to determine the probability and order of events as well as their most likely occurence in time . in secs .",
    "[ exci ] and [ supp ] , we will develop a dynamical model of disaster management , which specifies some parameters in the master equation .",
    "it relates to models of excitable media @xcite and supply networks @xcite .",
    "some analytical results for this model are presented in sec .",
    "[ simu ] , while sec .",
    "[ summ ] summarizes our results and closes with an outlook .",
    "in this section , we want to develop a simple method to reflect the approximate influence of different factors or sectors on each other .",
    "such factors may , for example , be energy supply , public transport , or medical support . in principle , it is a long list of variables @xmath0 , which may play a role for the problem under consideration .",
    "if we represent the influence of factor @xmath1 on factor @xmath0 by @xmath2 , we may summarize these ( directed ) influences by a matrix @xmath3 .",
    "however , in practical applications , one faces the following problems :    1 .",
    "the number of possible interactions grows quadratically with the number of variables or factors @xmath0 .",
    "it is , therefore , difficult to measure or even estimate all the influences @xmath2 .",
    "2 .   while it appears feasible to determine the _ direct _ influence @xmath4 of one variable @xmath1 on another one @xmath0 , it is hard or almost impossible to estimate the indirect influences over various nodes of the graph , which enter into @xmath2 as well .",
    "however , feedback loops may have an important effect and may neutralize or even overcompensate the direct influences .",
    "problem ( i ) can be partially resolved by clustering similar variables and selecting a representative one for each cluster .",
    "the remaining set of variables should contain the main explanatory variables .",
    "systematic statistical methods for such a procedure are , in principle , available , but intuition may be a good guide , when the quantitative data required for the clustering of variables are missing .",
    "problem ( ii ) may be addressed by estimating the _ indirect _ influences due to feedback loops based on the _ direct _ influcences @xmath4 , which can be summarized by a matrix @xmath5 .",
    "one may use a formula such as @xmath6 but as this converges only for small enough values of @xmath7 , we will instead use the formula @xmath8 \\ , , \\label{formula}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 denotes the unity matrix .",
    "the expression @xmath10 reflects all influences over @xmath11 nodes and @xmath12 links , i.e. @xmath13 corresponds to direct influences , @xmath14 to feedback loops with one intermediate node , @xmath15 to feedback loops with two intermediate nodes , etc .",
    "the prefactor @xmath16 is not only required for convergence , but with @xmath17 , it also allows to reflect that indirect interactions often become weaker , the more edges ( nodes ) are in between",
    ".    a further simplification can be reached by restricting to a few discrete values to characterize the influences .",
    "we may , for example , restrict ourselves to @xmath18 where @xmath19 means an extreme positive or negative influence , @xmath20 represents a strong influence , @xmath21 a weak influence , and @xmath22 a negligible influence . of course , a finer differentiation is possible , whenever necessary .",
    "( for an investigation of stylized relationships , it can also make sense to choose @xmath23 , where @xmath21 represents a strong positive or negative influence , then . )",
    "the matrix @xmath3 will be called the assessment matrix and summarizes all direct influences ( @xmath24 ) and feedback effects ( @xmath25 ) among the investigated factors .",
    "it allows conclusions about    * the resulting strength of desireable and undesireable interactions , when feedback effects are included , * the effect of failures of a specific sector ( node ) , * the suitability of possible measures to reach specific goals or improvements , * the side effects of these measures on other factors .",
    "this will be illustrated in more detail by the example in sec .",
    "[ ex ] .",
    "one open problem is the choice of the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "it controls how strong the indirect effects contribute in comparison with the direct effects .",
    "a small value of @xmath7 corresponds to neglecting indirect effects , i.e. @xmath26 while increasing values of @xmath7 reflect a growing influence of indirect effects .",
    "this is often the case for catastrophes , as these are frequently related to bifurcations or phase transitions , to avalanches or percolation effects @xcite . by variation of @xmath7",
    ", one can study different scenarios .",
    "note that @xmath7 may be interpreted as time coordinate : defining @xmath27 for an arbitrary vector @xmath28 , we find @xmath29 , @xmath30 \\vec{x}(0 ) \\nonumber \\\\   = \\mathbf{a}_\\tau \\vec{x}(0)\\ ] ] and @xmath31 from this point of view , @xmath32 describes the state of the system at time @xmath7 , and @xmath4 the changing rates .",
    "@xmath33 is a stationary solution and corresponds to the normal ( everyday ) state .",
    "an initial state @xmath34 may be interpreted as perturbation of the system by some ( catastrophic ) event .",
    "we should , however , note that the linear system of equations ( [ rough ] ) is certainly a rough description of the system dynamics .",
    "it is expected to hold only for small perturbations of the system state and does not consider damping effects due to disaster management .",
    "such aspects will be considered later on ( see secs .",
    "[ dyn ] and [ supp ] ) , after discussion of an example illustrating how to apply interaction matrices to cope with catastrophes .",
    "one advantage of our semi - quantitative approach to catastrophes is that it allows to estimate the impact of certain actions on the whole set of factors . usually , during a disaster",
    "the responsibilities have only dissatisfactory information and short time to decide , so in many cases they will take into account only direct impacts on other factors .",
    "in the worst case , this may lead to the opposite than the desired result , if the feedback effects exceed the direct influence . therefore , it would be better to know the implications on the whole system .",
    "as we have argued before , all direct and indirect effects are summarized by the matrix @xmath35 , which is determined from the matrix @xmath24 of direct interactions .",
    "different measures taken by the responsibilities are reflected by different matrices @xmath24 .",
    "as an example we consider the spreading of a disease .",
    "for illustrative reasons , we will restrict to the discussion of five factors only :    1 .   the number of _ infected persons _ , 2 .",
    "the quality of _ medical care _ , 3 .",
    "the _ public transport _ , 4 .",
    "the _ economic situation _ and 5 .",
    "the _ disposal _ of waste .",
    "these factors are not independent from each other , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ disease ] .",
    "the corresponding matrix of the assumed direct influences among the different factors is @xmath36 the right choice of the sign of the direct influence @xmath4 of factor @xmath1 on factor @xmath0 is plausible : we assume a positive sign if the factor @xmath0 increases with an increase of factor @xmath1 , while we assume a negative sign when factor @xmath0 decreases with the growth of factor @xmath1 .",
    "however , the determination of the absolute value of @xmath4 requires empirical data , expert knowledge , or experience .",
    "we have argued as follows :    * a growing number of infected persons affects all other factors in a negative way ( see first column ) , as these will not continue to work . that is , there will be problems to maintain a good economic situation , public transport , or the disposal of waste .",
    "health care is affected twice , as not only the medical personnel may be infected , but also a higher number of patients needs to be treated , and capacities are limited .",
    "therefore , we have chosen the value @xmath37 in this case , but @xmath38 for the other factors .",
    "* a well operating health system ( second column ) can reduce the number of infected persons efficiently , so that we have chosen a value of @xmath37 .",
    "the influence of the health system on the economic situation and other factors was assumed to be of indirect nature , by reducing the number of ill persons . *",
    "public transport ( third column ) contributes to a fast spreading of the infection assumed here .",
    "therefore , we have selected a value of @xmath39 .",
    "transport is also an important factor for economic prosperity ( therefore the value of @xmath39 ) , and it is required to get medical personnel and workers in the disposal sector to work ( which is reflected by a value of @xmath40 ) . * the economic situation ( fourth column ) has a significant effect on the quality of the health system , public transport , and disposal , so that we have chosen a value of @xmath39 in each case .",
    "* waste may contribute to the spreading of the disease , if it is not properly removed .",
    "therefore , a good disposal system ( fifth column ) may reduce the number of infections ( therefore the value of @xmath38 ) .",
    "it is also required for a functioning health system and economic production .",
    "that is , why we have assumed a value of 1 .",
    "depending on the respective situation , the concrete values of the direct influences @xmath4 may be somewhat different . for their specification",
    ", it can also be helpful to check the resulting values of @xmath2 of the overall direct plus indirect influence for their plausibility , and to compare the size of second - order or third - order interactions .",
    "for example , we see that the third - order feedback loop `` number of infected persons@xmath41economic situation@xmath41quality of the health system@xmath41number of infected persons '' is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "the same indirect influence is found for the feedback loop `` number of infected persons@xmath41economic situation@xmath41public transport@xmath41number of infected persons '' .",
    "moreover , according to our assumptions , the second - order autocatalytic increase of the number of infected persons via its impact on the health system is four times as large as the one via its impact on the waste disposal .",
    "one surprising observation is that the number of infected persons is reduced via its impact on public transport .",
    "in fact , once less busses are operated ( because the bus drivers are ill ) , the spreading rate of the disease is reduced .",
    "this may inspire responsibilities to reduce public transport or even stop it .",
    "later on , we will discuss the effect of this possible measure .",
    "before , let us have a look at the resulting overall interaction matrix @xmath43 for its calculation , we have chosen the value @xmath44 , which will also be used later on to assess alternative actions to fight the spreading of the disease . in order to discuss a certain scenario",
    ", we will assume that @xmath45 reflects the perturbation of factor @xmath1 . because of eq .",
    "( [ because ] ) , the quantities @xmath46 will be used to characterize the potential response of the system in the specific scenario described by the perturbations @xmath45 ( and without the damping effects by disaster management discussed in later sections of this contribution ) . here",
    ", @xmath47 denotes the kronecker function , which is 1 for @xmath48 and 0 otherwise .",
    "we will assume @xmath49 , as the number of infected persons is higher than normal , and @xmath50 , as the other factors are reduced by the spreading of the disease : @xmath51 moreover , if we attribute a weight of @xmath52 to the number of infected persons , a weight @xmath53 to the economic situation , and weights of @xmath54 to the quality of the medical care and public transport , while we do not care about waste in our evaluation ( i.e. @xmath55 ) , the resulting value of @xmath56 will be used to assess the overall situation of the system . in the stationary ( normal ) system state , @xmath57 would be zero .",
    "therefore , we want to find a strategy which brings @xmath57 close to zero . for our basic scenario ,",
    "we find @xmath58 these reference values will be compared with the values for alternative scenarios which correspond to different actions taken to fight the catastrophe .",
    "for example , let us assume to have limited stocks of vaccine for immunization .",
    "should we use these to immunize 1 ) the transport workers , 2 ) the medical staff , or 3 ) the disposal workers ? in the first case , we have the modified matrix @xmath59 which implies @xmath60 @xmath61 in the second case , when we immunize the medical staff , we find @xmath62 which implies @xmath63 @xmath64 in the third case , when the disposal workers are immunized , we expect @xmath65 which implies @xmath66 @xmath67 while the immunization of the public transport staff has almost no effect on the overall situation in the system , the last two measures can improve it .",
    "we see that it is more effective to immunize the medical staff than the disposal workers , and the best would be to immunize both groups .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath68 and we obtain @xmath69 @xmath70    other measures do not change the interactions in the system , but correspond to a change of the effective impact @xmath28 of the catastrophe . for example , we may consider to reduce public transport . with ( [ ausgang ] ) and @xmath71 we find @xmath72",
    "we see that the number of infections could , in fact , be reduced .",
    "however , the overall situation of the system has deteriorated , as the economic situation and all the other sectors were negatively affected , because many people could not reach their workplace .",
    "therefore , let us consider the option to increase the number of disposal workers",
    ". with ( [ ausgang ] ) and @xmath73 we find @xmath74 in conclusion , increasing the hygienic standards can be surprisingly efficient .",
    "+    finally , let us assume an improved waste disposal together with the immunization of both , the medical staff and the disposal workers .",
    "in that case the interactions of the relevant factors are characterized by matrix ( [ immunization ] ) , whereas the starting vector is again ( [ disposal ] ) .",
    "the resulting response is @xmath75 only this combination of measures manages to actually reduce the infections compared to the initial state , i.e. @xmath76 .",
    "however , we can also see that a negative impact on the economic situation and other factors can not be avoided . in any case",
    ", we can assess which measures are reasonable to take , which impact they will have on the system , and which measures need to be combined in order to control the spreading of the disease ( or other problems in different scenarios ) .",
    "the simple example in this section was chosen to illustrate the procedure how to assess interaction networks and potential optimization measures . in an on - going project",
    ", we do now investigate the interaction network among a large number of factors for the floodings in germany during august 2002 and other catastrophes .",
    "this involves considerably more detailed and much larger matrices @xmath24 , where nobody would be able to assess the feedback loops without a method such as the one proposed above .",
    "it also involves other aspects such as human forces fighting the catastrophe and the availability of technical or other equipment etc , which will be modeled in the following sections .",
    "before , we have used the interaction network predominantly for the static assessment of the influence of different factors on each other .",
    "we will now try to extend this method step by step in a way that allows a semi - quantitative analysis of the time - dependence of catastrophes for the purpose of anticipation , which helps to prepare for the next step in catastrophe management or prevention .",
    "we are particularly interested in the domino or avalanche effects of particular events such as the failure of a certain factor or sector in the interaction network .",
    "we will assume that this failure spreads along and in the order of the direct connections in the interaction network ( causality graph ) . in terms of example in sec .",
    "[ ex ] , a failure of medical care would first affect the number of infected persons , and in a second step the economic situation , public transport , and the disposal of waste .    for a description of the catastrophe dynamics ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath77 denotes the impact on factor @xmath0 at time @xmath7 and @xmath78 the rate at which this impact spreads to factor @xmath1 , while @xmath79 is a damping rate describing the mitigation of the catastrophic impact on factor @xmath0 by disaster management . in this case",
    ", it is reasonable to assume the dynamics @xmath80 with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "the symbol @xmath47 represents the kronecker function , i.e. it is 1 for @xmath48 and otherwise 0 .",
    "when no better information is available , we may assume that the spreading rate @xmath84 is proportional to the strength @xmath85 of the direct influence of factor @xmath1 on factor @xmath0 . with a constant proportionality factor",
    "@xmath86 this means @xmath87 the formal solution of equation ( [ dgl ] ) for a time - independent matrix @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 that is , @xmath90 describes the spreading of an event in the causality network ( interaction network ) in the course of time @xmath7 , while @xmath91 reflects the initial impact of a catastrophic event .",
    "a random series of catastrophic events can be described by adding a random variable @xmath92 to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dgl ] ) .",
    "when we assume @xmath93 equation ( [ dgl ] ) is related to the liouville representation of the discrete master equation . in this case",
    ", we can apply all the solution methods developed for it .",
    "this includes the so - called path integral solution @xcite , which allows one to calculate the occurence probability of specific spreading paths .",
    "this has some interesting implications .",
    "for example , the danger that the impact on sector @xmath94 affects the sectors @xmath95 in the indicated order is quantified by @xmath96 moreover , the average time at which this series of events has occured can be calculated as @xmath97 and the variance of this time is determined by @xmath98 that is , eq . ( [ dgl ] )",
    "does not only allow to assess the likelyhood of certain series of events rather accurately , but also their approximate appearance times .",
    "in other words , we have a detailed picture of the potential catastrophic scenarios and of their time evolution , which allows for a specific preparation and disaster management .    in the following",
    ", we do not want to restrict to the case ( [ case ] ) . if @xmath99 for all @xmath0 , the damping is weak and the solutions @xmath77 are expected to grow more or less exponentially in the course of time , which describes a scenario where control is lost and the catastrophe spreads all over the system .",
    "in many cases , we will have @xmath100 for all @xmath0 , i.e. the impact of the catastrophe on the system decays in the course of time , and @xmath101 .",
    "this determines , how strong the damping effects , i.e. the means counteracting the catastrophe have to be chosen . in terms of sec .",
    "[ supp ] , this concerns the specification of the parameters @xmath102 .",
    "finally , it may also happen that @xmath103 for some factors @xmath0 , but @xmath104 for others .",
    "in such situations , everything depends on the initial impact @xmath91 and on the matrix @xmath90",
    ". however , in all these cases , eqs .",
    "( [ eins ] ) to ( [ drei ] ) remain valid .",
    "the damping effects @xmath79 are , to a large extent , related to the forces counter - acting the catastrophe .",
    "therefore , we will now develop a dynamical model for these , while our previous considerations assumed some more or less constant value of @xmath79 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath105 the quantity of human forces ( e.g. police , fire fighers , or military ) ready for action , or the quantity of materials ( e.g. technical or medical equipment ) ready for use to fight the catastrophe .",
    "the index @xmath12 distinguishes different kinds of forces or required materials",
    ". we will assume the following equation : @xmath106 the first term on the right - hand side describes the quantity @xmath107 of ( human ) forces and materials , which were exhausted or not usable , but become available again after an average time period of @xmath108 .",
    "the second term delineates reserve forces of quantity @xmath109 , which are activated from the `` standby mode '' at a rate @xmath110 after the occurence of a catastrophe ( plus sign ) , while they are removed after the recovery from the disaster ( minus sign ) . in most cases , @xmath111 , due to possible fatalities .",
    "the third term describes the activation of the forces @xmath12 to fight the problems with factor or sector @xmath0 . for simplicity ,",
    "it is here assumed to be proportional to the strenth @xmath112 of the catastrophic impact on factor @xmath0 , with proportionality factors @xmath102 which reflect the priorities in disaster management and the speed with which the forces or materials @xmath12 become available for @xmath0 .",
    "the exponent @xmath113 allows to distinguish different cases : when the impact of the catastrophe on factor @xmath0 is known , we may assume @xmath114 .",
    "however , when the active forces are assumed to order more forces , an exponent @xmath115 can make sense as well .",
    "the quantities @xmath116 of forces in action or materials in use change in time according to the equation @xmath117 the first term on the right - hand side is due to the available forces @xmath12 , which are activated for fighting the catastrophe , while the second term describes a reduction of the active forces , as they become exhausted or damaged and require rest or repair after an average time period of @xmath118 .",
    "the third term describes unrecoverable losses such as fatalities or unrecoverable damage of materials , which are assumed to occur with a rate @xmath119 proportional to the catastrophic impact @xmath112 .",
    "the quantity of exhausted or damaged forces is described by the following differential equation : @xmath120 herein , @xmath121 is the rate at which the forces @xmath12 become exhausted or damaged , while @xmath122 is the recovery or repair rate .",
    "the above model already contain many effects which are typically relevant in practical situations .",
    "we should note that it is related to models of excitable media developed to describe chemical waves , the propagation of electrical pulses in heart tissue , laola waves in human crowds in stadia @xcite , or the spreading of forest fires @xcite .",
    "these models typically contain three different states : an excitable one , an active one , and a refractory one . in our model of disaster management , refractory states are described by the variables @xmath107 , active states by the variables @xmath116 , and excitable states by the variables @xmath105 . due to this analogy , we expect to find certain pattern formation phenomena for our model of disaster management . in a forth - coming paper",
    ", this aspect shall be investigated in more detail .",
    "in the following , we will try to get an idea of the possible behavior of the excitable media model of disaster management suggested in sec .",
    "the stationary state of this model is , for @xmath123 , given by @xmath124 in order to investigate the sensitivity with respect to small perturbations , we will carry out a linear stability analysis of the simplified model with one sector @xmath0 , @xmath125 , @xmath123 , and one kind @xmath12 of forces .",
    "dropping the subscripts and defining @xmath126 , the resulting coupled set of differential equations is : @xmath127 its stationary solution is given by @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 with @xmath131 it is stable with respect to disturbances , if all eigenvalues @xmath132 are non - positive .",
    "these eigenvalues can be calculated in the usual way .",

    "are both unfavourable .",
    "therefore , @xmath113 should be small enough . otherwise , if active forces recruit other forces , the resulting `` autocatalytic effect '' may cause instabilities or overreactions in the supply with forces and materials .",
    "this effect is most likely for disasters which nobody was prepared for , where the recruiting mechanism plays the most signifant role .",
    "it may explain the suboptimal distribution of forces observed in these situations @xcite .",
    "finally , we have to specify the influence of disaster mangement activities on the damping @xmath79 of the impact @xmath148 , which a catastrophic event has on sector @xmath0 .",
    "let us assume that we have @xmath149 different kinds of forces , materials or technical equipment . with @xmath150 , we will indicate that the forces or materials @xmath12 can substitute each other , i.e. @xmath149 summarizes equivalent forces or materials . on the other hand ,",
    "certain actions require the simultaneous presence of different supplementary kinds of forces and materials .",
    "let us assume that the quantities simultaneously required to reduce the problems with factor @xmath0 are represented by the coefficients @xmath151 .",
    "the units of @xmath151 shall be chosen in a way that the following equation holds : @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the rate of activating forces @xmath12 to mitigate the situation of factor @xmath0 .",
    "this equation reflects that , if only one of the required forces or materials is missing , no successful action can be taken .",
    "moreover , there may be a loss @xmath154 of efficiency , e.g. due to queueing or limited capacities ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "the formula is analogous to that for production systems , where a product can not be finished , as long as some required part or worker is missing , and where finite storage capacities may cause losses @xcite .",
    "therefore , this formula delineates the inefficiencies in disaster management , which occur when forces and materials are distributed in the wrong way .",
    "it has sometimes been reported , that too many forces have been located at some place , and missing at others @xcite . here , models designed to optimize supply networks could help to optimize the efficiency of disaster management @xcite .",

    "it is reasonable to assume a generalized function @xmath156 with @xmath157 and @xmath158 herein , the minimum reflects the worst case , while the sum over @xmath149 describes the best case ( if we neglect non - linearities , which may sometimes arise due to synergy effects ) .",
    "the specification @xmath159^{1/q}\\ ] ] describes both extreme cases .",
    "the sum over @xmath149 corresponds to @xmath160 , while the minimum results for @xmath161 .",
    "hence , a variation of the parameter @xmath162 allows to investigate different possible scenarios lying between the best case and the worst case . in order to model synergy effects between different forces , one would have to add nonlinear terms , e.g. bilinear ones .",
    "however , this would introduce a large number of additional parameters , which are even harder to estimate than the first - order effects included in our model .",
    "note that we already have non - linearities in our model , namely the products @xmath163 and the function @xmath156 .",
    "the framework of supply networks also allows one to move from the semi - quantitative description of disaster management in secs .",

    "the above equations reduce to @xmath174 let us assume that the stationary state of this supply system is given by @xmath175 .",
    "moreover let us denote the deviations from the stationary state by @xmath176 . with @xmath177 the linearized version of eq .",

    "hence , they can be used to estimate the time of impact on other factors or sectors in the supply network .",
    "one particularly important aspect of supply networks is their sensitivity or robustness with respect to perturbations .",
    "it is , for example , known that supply chains may suffer from the so - called bullwhip effect , i.e. small temporal variations in the demand may cause large variations in the supply .",
    "this instability leads both to undesireable delays in delivery at some places and large stock levels at others @xcite . in disaster management",
    ", this effect can have serious consequences .",
    "however , anticipation is known to efficiently stabilize the dynamics of supply networks @xcite . as the formulas from sec .",
    "[ dyn ] can be used to estimate the approximate time at which certain factors are likely to be affected , they can help to optimize the supply chain management , in particular to stabilize the supply of forces and materials in time .",
    "it is certainly reasonable to have forces available in time to fight the spreading of the disaster to other sectors , rather than sending them all to the places which are already devastated .",
    "the philosophy is to reach an anticipative disaster management rather than having a responsive one . to model anticipation",
    ", the term @xmath193 has to be replaced by @xmath194 where @xmath195 denotes the anticipation time horizon .",
    "even more interesting is the robustness of supply networks with respect to structural changes , e.g. when some supplier fails to work or to deliver .",
    "this may be investigated by changing the coefficients @xmath102 and @xmath151 , which characterize the supply network .",
    "the influence of the topology of the supply network on its robustness , reliability , and dynamics is presently under investigation @xcite .",
    "it has , for example , been noticed that supply ladders are more robust than linear supply chains or supply hierarchies ( see fig .",
    "[ sup ] ) .",
    "it is not surprising that the redundance of supply ladders , i.e. the availability of alternative delivery channels , stabilizes the system compared to a linear supply chain .",
    "we note , however , that hierarchical systems are very common in disaster management , and better alternatives are expected to be found in a research project that we presently pursue .    0.9 cm    ( 6,12.5)(0,5 ) ( 0.05,17 ) ( 0.05,15 ) ( 0.05,5.6 ) ( 0,17.5)(a ) ( 0,16.5)(b ) ( 0,12.1)(c )    some insights regarding the robustness of networks have already been gained for the world wide web and other networks @xcite .",
    "however , it is questionable whether the results for small - world , scale - free or random networks can directly be transfered to disaster management .",
    "further research in this direction would be very helpful .",
    "in the past , physics has made significant contributions to the understanding of catastrophes .",
    "this concerns , for example , the statistics of extreme events and avalanche effects . in this paper , we have tried to indicate how physics could contribute to disaster management @xcite .",
    "we have sketched a rather general , semi - quantitative approach for the assessment of interaction networks which can serve for decision support , as it allows to compare potential optimization measures including their side effects .",
    "the method takes into account feedback loops and can be generalized to a dynamical model , which is suitable to estimate likely sequences of events and the times at which they are expected to materialize .",
    "we have also described the dynamics of disaster management in a way similar to excitable media , distinguishing an excitable state ( `` ready to go '' ) , an active state , and a refractory ( exhausted ) state requiring recovery . as successful actions need the simultaneous presence and/or action of several specialized forces and particular equipment , there was also a direct connection with the management of supply networks .",
    "we have pointed out that the management of disasters and supply chains can be considerably improved by anticipation , based on the formulas in this paper . moreover , the robustness @xcite crucially depends on the structure of the supply network . in an on - going study , we investigate the optimal network structure to achieve robustness with respect to dynamical and structural perturbations @xcite . the statistical physics of networks and graphs @xcite",
    "is expected to make significant contributions to this .",
    "some relevant aspects for the optimization of organizations and work groups have already been studied @xcite .",
    "our proposed approach connects to several methods and fields from statistical physics , such as the master equation @xcite , excitable media @xcite , and the dynamics of transport ( supply ) processes @xcite .",
    "it is also in the tradition of system dynamics @xcite , which has , with some success , been used to anticipate future problems of society @xcite . in such kinds of studies ,",
    "it is reasonable to carry out a sensitivity analysis @xcite and to investigate the impact of random effects @xcite , which do , of course , play a significant role for the dynamics of catastrophes .",
    "apart from stochastic methods , one may in the future also apply elements of fuzzy logic @xcite in order to describe the vague knowledge and soft facts , on which disaster management is often based .",
    "insufficient , inconsistent , and uncertain information is one of the typical complications of disaster management , which makes it difficult to assess alternatives and to take the best decision , in particular under often very tense time constraints . in the future ,",
    "information theory @xcite is expected to make some valuable contributions to the design of decision support systems which can integrate inconsistent information and handle incomplete information @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "statistical physics offers various promising concepts to develop and improve methods of disaster management .",
    "we think that the theory of self - organization @xcite is particularly promising for this , having in mind principles such as synchronization @xcite , distributed control @xcite , and optimal self - organization @xcite .",
    "it is expected that an application of these principles would lead to a more flexible , efficient , and robust disaster management compared to the present centralized or hierarchical concepts .",
    "this work has been inspired by interviews of several central persons involved into the management of the disastrous floodings in germany during august 2002 .",
