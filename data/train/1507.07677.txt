    "the stackelberg competition is a game theoretic model by von stackelberg  @xcite for studying market structures .",
    "the original formulation of a stackelberg duopoly captures the scenario of two firms that compete by selling homogeneous products .",
    "one firm ( _ the leader _ ) first decides the quantity to sell and announces it publicly , while the second firm ( _ the follower _ ) decides only after observing the announcement of the first firm .",
    "the leader firm must generally have a commitment power ( e.g. , it is the monopoly in an industry ) and can not undo its publicly announced strategy .",
    "the follower firm ( e.g. , a new competitor ) plays a best response to the leader s chosen strategy .",
    "the stackelberg competition has also been an important model in economics ever since and the _ stackelberg equilibrium _",
    "solution concept has been studied in a rich body of literature in computer science with a number of real - world applications ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) .    in this paper , we are interested in the following questions : _ what is the optimal strategy that the leader should commit to in a general extensive - form game",
    "? can such strategies be computed efficiently ? _ we answer these questions for several classes of extensive - form games and variants of the stackelberg solution concept giving both efficient algorithms and computational hardness results .",
    "we study the standard notion of stackelberg equilibrium in extensive - form games , where the leader publicly announces the action(s ) she will take at _ each _ decision point in the game ( should that point be reached ) _ before _ the play , after which the follower plays a best response . moreover , we study the extension of the stackelberg equilibrium _ with correlation _",
    "@xcite in extensive - form games .",
    "the main idea of this extension is that the leader can send signals to the follower when the follower has to act , recommending actions to take .",
    "while this signaling does not have a direct effect on the game , it allows for correlation between the strategies .",
    "@xmath0 : :    _ information _ : captures how much a player knows about the opponent s    moves ( past and present ) .",
    "the main classes are _ turn - based games _    ( tb ) , where for each state there is a unique player that can perform    an action and _ concurrent - move games _ ( cm ) , where the players may have    to act simultaneously in at least one state .",
    "@xmath0 : :    _ chance _ : a game with chance nodes allows stochastic transitions    between states ; otherwise , the transitions are deterministic ( made    through actions of the players ) .",
    "@xmath0 : :    _ graph _ : we focus on _ trees _ and _ directed acyclic graphs _ ( dags ) as    the main representations . given such a graph ,",
    "each node represents a    different state in the game , while the edges represent the transitions    between states .",
    "@xmath0 : :    _ strategies _ : we study several major types of strategies that the    leader can commit to , namely _ pure _ ( p ) , _ behavioral _ ( b ) , and    _ correlated behavioral _ ( c ) .",
    ".overview of the computational complexity results containing both existing and new results provided by this paper ( marked with * ) .",
    "information column : tb stands for _ turn - based _ and cm for _ concurrent moves_. strategies : p stands for _ pure _ , b for _ behavioral _ , and c for _ correlated_. finally , @xmath1 denotes the number of decision points in the game and @xmath2 the number of terminal states . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     consider a feasible solution @xmath3 to the knapsack problem with unit - items .",
    "this translates into a strategy for the leader as follows . in the root node she plays the uniform strategy , and in sub - game @xmath4",
    "plays @xmath5 with probability 1 if @xmath6 and plays @xmath7 with probability 1 otherwise .",
    "we can now observe that the follower plays @xmath8 in sub - games @xmath4 where @xmath6 , since ties are broken in favor of the leader , and the follower plays @xmath9 in sub - games @xmath4 where @xmath10 . in the root node ,",
    "action @xmath11 for the follower thus leads to payoff @xmath12 .",
    "actions @xmath13 for @xmath14 leads to payoff @xmath15 . since",
    "ties are broken in favor of the leader , the follower plays action @xmath11 , which means that the leader receives payoff @xmath16 , which is the value of the knapsack solution .",
    "if in sub - game @xmath17 the leader commits to playing @xmath5 with probability 1 , the follower will choose to play l due to ties being broken in favor of the leader .",
    "if on the other hand the leader plays @xmath5 with probability strictly lower than 1 , the follower will choose to play r , leading to utility 0 for the leader , and at most 0 for the follower .",
    "since the leader can only obtain positive utility if the follower plays action @xmath11 in the root node , there is thus no benefit for the leader in decreasing the utility for the follower by committing to a strictly mixed strategy .",
    "so from now on we assume that the leader plays using a pure strategy in each sub - game @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath18 $ ] be such the set of indices @xmath19 of the sub - games @xmath4 where the leader commits to action @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath20 $ ] be such that the leader commits to playing action @xmath21 with probability @xmath22 .",
    "then if the follower plays action @xmath11 , the leader obtains payoff @xmath23 and the follower obtains payoff @xmath24 .",
    "if the follower plays action @xmath13 , for @xmath25 , the leader obtains payoff @xmath26 and the follower obtains payoff @xmath27 .        by definition of @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "we have @xmath35 multiplying both sides of the inequality by @xmath36 and using @xmath37 we then have @xmath38 which means that action @xmath13 is preferred by the follower . thus the leader receives payoff 0 .",
    "since we have a knapsack with unit - items instance , there is a knapsack solution that obtains value @xmath40 , which corresponds to a strategy for the leader that obtains the same utility .",
    "since the current strategy is optimal for the leader we must have @xmath41 , which means that @xmath42 , and thus @xmath43 .",
    "we then have by definition of @xmath34 that @xmath44 thus the payoff for the follower is strictly positive for the action @xmath13 , and this is thus preferred to @xmath11 , thus leading to payoff 0 to the leader .",
    "since there is a strategy for the leader that obtains strictly positive payoff , we can thus assume that the strategy for the leader chooses an action uniformly at random in the root node , and the follower chooses action @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath11 is preferred by the follower to any other action this means that @xmath45 , and the leader obtains payoff @xmath16 .",
    "thus this corresponds exactly to a feasible solution to the knapsack instance of the same value .",
    "let @xmath46 be a leader node , with successors @xmath8 and @xmath9 , each with tables @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "if the leader plays @xmath8 with probability @xmath49 and plays @xmath9 with the remaining probability @xmath50 , followed up by the strategies that gave the guarantees for @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] , then the leader would get an expected @xmath53 , while being able to offer @xmath54+(1-p ) a_r[j]$ ] to the follower . for a given @xmath28 ,",
