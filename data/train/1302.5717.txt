    "as light passes an object , it diffracts around it and spreads out by an angle @xmath0 , so if the angle that the object subtends , @xmath1 , is less than this , the object `` disappears '' .",
    "furthermore , if the object has mass , light that passes close - by is delayed by travelling through its potential well . the figure of merit for whether diffraction is important in gravitational lensing is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the schwarzschild radius of the lens . for values of @xmath4",
    "much less than unity , diffraction dominates and the peak magnification is greatly diminished , for large values of @xmath4 the diffraction fringes are closely spaced , so either the finite size of the source or the finite bandwidth of the observations can easily smear them out yielding the magnification that one expects from geometric optics .",
    "the path length from the star at @xmath5 to the telescope through the point @xmath6 in the lens plane is @xmath7 the magnification of the star is related to the sum of all the phases from the light taking various paths , @xmath8 the schwarzschild radius of the earth is about one centimeter . beyond @xmath9  au",
    "lensing dominates over occultation",
    ". therefore , let s take @xmath10 .",
    "if we take the integral over the amplitudes to be @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 the magnification increases with the value of @xmath4 with the peak magnification given by @xmath14 .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : finite_sources ] depicts the magnification as function of the impact parameter of the source relative to the lens in units of the einstein radius and the value of @xmath4 .",
    "averaging over bandwidth or over a finite source brings the oscillations toward the geometric .",
    "however , if @xmath15 there is little magnification . for large values of @xmath4 , the size of the oscillation scales as @xmath16 the right panel of figure  [ fig : finite_sources ]",
    "gives a estimate of the radio flux density ( red ) and amplitude of its oscillation ( blue ) at 10  ghz for stars in the bulge field 1 of the ogle - ii survey ( szymanski 2005 ; udalski , kubiak & szymanski 1997 ) .",
    "the fluxes are normalized using the values for arcturus at 1  kpc ( consult heyl ( 2010b ) for details ) .",
    "there is a second complementary signature ( heyl 2010c ) .",
    "as the lens passes in front of the source , its position on the sky appears to move .",
    "the key idea to figure how where the image appears is that the gradient of the phase of the wave as measured at the telescope points toward the image .",
    "furthermore , the situation is symmetric about the lens , so moving the telescope to the right is like moving the source to the left , and we can take the gradient of the phase with respect to the position of the source instead at the telescope , yielding the centroid of the image @xmath17\\ ] ] figure  [ fig : astrometry ] shows that lensing moves the centroid radially outward : the closer the passage , the greater the deviation .",
    "minima in the displacement correspond to maxima of the magnification , and the displacement reaches the blue curve @xmath18 at minima of the magnification .",
    "for distant asteroids @xmath19 ( heyl 2010a ) . if they are massive , lensing is also important .",
    "if lensing is weak , the fresnel pattern gets lensed",
    ". if lensing is strong , things are more complex .",
    "the ska could detect oscillations from earth - mass lenses as far as 10  pc against bulge giants .",
