    "it has long been known that early - type galaxies in nearby clusters exhibit a tight color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) , i.e. more luminous early - type galaxies have redder colors than less luminous ones ( baum 1959 ; visvanathan & sandage 1977 ; bower et al .",
    "1992 ) , and this finding has been confirmed by later studies ( aragon - salamanca et al .",
    "1993 ; stanford et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ; ellis et al . 1997 ; kodama et al . 1998 ; terlevich et al . 2001 ; bernardi et al . 2003 , 2005 ; blanton et al .",

    "hogg et al . 2004 ; cool et al .",
    "2006 ; chang et al .",
    "this relation has been mainly ascribed to the metallicity effect , either because more massive galaxies have stronger binding energies so that the gas can be enriched to higher metallicity ( faber 1977 ; dressler 1984 ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; kodama & arimoto 1997 ) , or because larger ellipticals form at low redshift through major mergers between more massive , metal - rich disk systems ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; de lucia et al .",
    "2004 ; kang et al .",
    "2005 ) .    however , the case for late - type galaxies is much more complicated partially because of the influence of on - going star formation and the effect of dust attenuation .",
    "almost thirty years ago , visvanathan & griersmith ( 1977 ) find that early - type spiral galaxies ( s0/a to sab ) in the virgo cluster exhibit very similar optical cmr to that of e / s0 galaxies , i.e. brighter spirals show redder colors , except that the former has a much larger scatter . based on a large sample from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) , blanton et al .",
    "( 2003b ) investigate the broadband optical properties for concentrated galaxies ( fitted sersic index @xmath2 ) and exponential galaxies ( @xmath3 ) and find that exponential galaxies have a less tight , but undeniable optical cmr .",
    "baldry et al .",
    "( 2004 ) analyze the bimodal color - magnitude distribution of sdss galaxies and find that both red and blue - distribution galaxies can be well fitted by a straight line plus a _ tanh _ function .",
    "in other words , the low - luminosity blue - distribution galaxies ( @xmath4 ) show a shallower cmr slope than high - luminosity galaxies .",
    "however , these works are all limited to the optical bands .",
    "tully et al . (",
    "1998 ) investigate global extinction in spiral galaxies and establish optical - ir cmrs for spirals after correction for dust attenuation .",
    "peltier & de grijs ( 1998 ) determine an optical - infrared cmr ( @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 ) for spiral galaxies .",
    "they find the cmr is very tight and its slope is steeper than that for elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "this result is consistent with early studies ( e.g. wyse 1982 ; tully et al .",
    "1982 ; mobasher et al .",
    "1986 ) . using stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models ,",
    "they conclude that faint spiral galaxies have both a younger age and a lower metallicity than bright spirals .",
    "bell & de jong ( 2000 ) have compiled a sample of 121 low - inclination spiral galaxies with radially resolved optical and near - infrared photometry . by comparing the available photometry with the sps model colors , they found that the star formation history of a galaxy ( as probed by its age , metallicity and gas fraction ) strongly correlates with its surface brightness and magnitude .",
    "these results are confirmed by macarthur et al .",
    "however , all those early studies are limited to small galaxy samples since it is difficult to get large and homogeneous optical and infrared photometric samples simultaneously .    on the other hand ,",
    "the interpretation of these observed cmrs is still a challenge for semi - analytic models .",
    "van den bosch ( 2002 ) and bell et al . ( 2003 ) find that there is significant discrepancy between the predictions of semi - analytic models and the data .",
    "the observations show that brighter spiral galaxies are redder than fainter ones , while the models predict that fainter spirals should be slightly redder than bright spirals . recently ,",
    "kang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) introduce a semi - analytic model based on high - resolution n - body simulations and compare their model predictions with the observed bimodal distribution in the color - magnitude diagram found by baldry et al .",
    "they find that the prediction for the red branch is very close to the observations , but for the blue part , the predicted colors of luminous spirals are bluer and those of less luminous spirals are redder than observations .",
    "all these results suggest that the implied physics of gas accretion and feedback during the formation and evolution of spiral galaxies are still not well understood ( van den bosch 2000 ; bell et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that the comparison presented by kang et al.(2005 ) is only limited to the color @xmath7 , which is very sensitive to dust attenuation .",
    "furthermore , the degeneracy between stellar age and metallicity for optical colors complicates further investigations for the star formation history of late - type galaxies .",
    "thus , there is still a long way to go before getting robust conclusions . since the combination of optical and near - infrared broad - band colors can partially break age - metallicity degeneracy , it is important to establish observationally the cmrs in both optical and near - infrared bands for late - type galaxies based on a large homogenous sample .",
    "the sdss and two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , jarrett 2000a , b ) have already created the largest well - defined sample of galaxies with well - measured optical and infrared photometry to date .",
    "recently , we have analyzed the optical and infrared color properties for early - type galaxies after correcting the aperture mismatch between these two magnitude systems ( chang et al .",
    "this paper is a complementary study of chang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . here",
    "the samples are selected for late - type galaxies .",
    "one of our aims is to establish optical , optical - infrared and infrared cmrs for late - type galaxies by using the largest homogeneous samples up - to - date .    to derive the optical - infrared colors , we adopt the method presented in chang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and correct sdss magnitudes to the aperture where 2mass magnitudes are measured . for the purpose of minimizing the different dust attenuation caused by different inclinations ,",
    "the galaxies in our sample are limited to face - on spirals .",
    "we also calculate the emission - line - free colors by comparing the magnitude difference before and after removing the emission lines from the spectra . with these carefully corrected optical and optical - infrared colors ,",
    "we compare the correlations between colors and absolute magnitude , stellar mass and stellar mass surface density and try to distinguish which parameter mainly determines the color properties for late - type galaxies .",
    "moreover , by comparing the colors of our sample galaxies with those of sps models , we investigate the stellar populations of spiral galaxies and their implications on star formation processes in late - type galaxies .    the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the way of selecting sample galaxies and the photometric quantities used in the paper .",
    "section 3.1 presents the method to do the photometric aperture corrections .",
    "the magnitude corrections for emission - line contamination is shown in section 3.2 .",
    "section 4 is the main part of the paper , where we present various correlations between colors and absolute magnitudes , stellar mass and stellar mass surface density and their comparisons .",
    "section 5 describes the sps models and the model predictions for stellar populations of spiral galaxies .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarize the main results of this paper .",
    "the data used in this paper is mainly taken from data release 4 of the sdss ( york et al .",
    "2000 ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter edr ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "in particular , we use the main galaxy sample in the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ) , which is based on the sdss database , but with an independent set of enhanced reductions ( blanton et al . 2005 ) . from this catalog , we take spectroscopic redshift and photometric quantities , including petrosian magnitudes , k - corrections , axis ratio @xmath8 from the exponential fitting ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the semimajor and semiminor axes ) and @xmath11 . the parameter @xmath11 is obtained by taking the best - fit exponential and de vaucouleurs fit to the surface brightness profile , finding the linear combination of the two that best fits the image , and storing the fraction contributed by the de vaucouleurs fit .",
    "we also take the quantities from profmean , the azimuthally averaged surface brightness in a series of fixed circular annuli ( see table 7 in edr ) , which are used to make the aperture correction for the optical - infrared colors ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "the 2mass is a ground - based , near - infrared imaging survey of the whole sky and its extended source catalog ( xsc ) contains nearly 1.6 million galaxies ( jarrett et al .",
    "2000a , b ) .",
    "the infrared magnitudes are taken from extended source catalog ( xsc ) of 2mass . in section 3.1",
    ", we will describe how to estimate the optical - infrared colors .",
    "conversion from apparent magnitude @xmath12 to absolute magnitude @xmath13 depends on the adopted cosmology and the k - correction : @xmath14 - 25-k(z),\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the luminosity distance in unit of mpc and @xmath16 is the k - correction .",
    "we assume the standard cosmology with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19=70 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath21 to calculate luminosity distance .",
    "we use sdss @xmath22band petrosian magnitude and calculate @xmath23 at redshift @xmath24 .",
    "k - corrections for magnitudes in the _ g , r , i , z bands ( and _ j , h , k bands",
    "if needed ) are taken from nyu - vagc ( blanton et al .",
    "2003a ; blanton et al .",

    "_ _    [ t ]    [ t ]    sample galaxies are selected from main galaxy sample in the nyu - vagc ( blanton et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we adopt the @xmath22band morphology indicator @xmath11 to select late - type galaxies with criteria @xmath25 , which means that the surface brightness of selected galaxy is more likely to be expressed by exponential profile .",
    "adopting @xmath26 parameter has the advantage of seeing and inclination correction during the profile fitting ( bernardi et al . 2005 ) . from this criteria",
    ", our sample contains 154,870 late - type galaxies .",
    "we further restrict our sample with the condition @xmath27 so as to select nearly face - on galaxies based on two considerations .",
    "firstly , edge - on galaxies are more dust - attenuated and reddened than face - on systems ( tully et al .",
    "1998 ; xiao et al .",
    "this effect will introduce extra dispersion into the cmrs .",
    "in other words , by selecting face - on galaxies , we can minimize the effects of dust attenuation caused by different inclination of the spiral disks .",
    "secondly , the isophoto aperture of the high axis - ratio galaxies is nearly circular . in this case",
    ", the sdss profmean measured in circular radii can be properly used to make the aperture correction of optical - infrared colors with enough accuracy .",
    "after this , the number of late - type galaxies is reduced to 45,033 .    furthermore , we restrict our sample to galaxies in the redshift range @xmath28 .",
    "the lower limit is to reduce the uncertainty using the redshift as distance estimator .",
    "the upper limit is to lower the uncertainties on k - corrections for the magnitudes and to reduce the possible color evolution with redshift .",
    "finally , the number of galaxies is further reduced to 40,987 .",
    "we denote this sample as sample a and use it to investigate the optical cmrs .",
    "the nyu - vagc also contains a matched sample between sdss and 2mass xsc .",
    "this sample is obtained by positionally matching sources observed by 2mass to galaxies in the ` main ' spectroscopic sample of the sdss within @xmath29 .",
    "we select all the galaxies in sample a with 2mass match to create sample b. there is no cut in neither @xmath30 nor surface brightness in k - band .",
    "the final number of galaxies in sample b is 9,930 .",
    "sample b is used to investigate the optical - infrared and infrared cmrs .",
    "1 plots histograms of several quantities for the galaxies in sample a ( solid lines ) and sample b ( dotted lines ) , including @xmath31 , concentration @xmath32 ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the radii including 50% and 90% of the petrosian fluxes ) , r - band apparent magnitude @xmath35 and redshift @xmath36 . as we can see from the top - right panel of fig .",
    "1 , most of the sample galaxies have @xmath37 , consistent with the early studies of the morphology separation with parameter @xmath38 ( e.g. strateva et al . 2001 ) . compared with sample a",
    ", the galaxies in sample b are biased to be apparently bright , large and to lower redshifts .",
    "this is due to the fact that 2mass is much more shallow than sdss .",
    "in order to estimate the optical - infrared colors , it is important that both sdss and 2mass magnitudes are measured within the same aperture .",
    "we adopt the same method as that in chang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to do aperture corrections for the magnitudes , i.e. to correct sdss magnitudes to the aperture where the 2mass magnitudes are measured .",
    "there are several sets of magnitudes provided in the 2mass xsc . in this paper",
    ", we use the isophotal fiducial magnitudes , which are measured within the circular aperture corresponding to a surface brightness of 20.0 mag arcsec@xmath39 in the @xmath40-band ( the aperture is denoted as @xmath41 ) .",
    "sdss provides the azimuthally averaged surface brightness in a series of circular annuli , i.e. profmean .",
    "we calculate @xmath42 magnitudes that are matched to the 2mass measurements by interpolating the cumulative radial surface brightness profile in each sdss band at the corresponding isophotal radius @xmath41 ( using the recommended approach in section 4.4.6.2 of edr ) .",
    "the derived magnitude in _",
    "r - band @xmath43 is used to estimate the optical - infrared colors throughout this paper .",
    "the average value of magnitude correction in the r - band for aperture mismatch is 0.26 .",
    "2 plots the distribution of several quantities for galaxies in sample b , including two times petrosian radius in the @xmath44-band @xmath45 ( from sdss)-band @xmath45 is the aperture to which the petrosian magnitudes are integrated , see edr ] , the isophotal radius @xmath41 ( from 2mass ) , the aperture mismatch @xmath46 and the ratio between the @xmath44-band flux within @xmath41 and the petrosian flux . it can be seen that the aperture mismatch between sdss and 2mass is quite large .",
    "however , more than half of the petrosian flux is already contained within @xmath41 for most of galaxies .      since late - type galaxies have on - going star formation , emission lines from hii regions have significant contributions to the observed magnitudes .",
    "however , sps models generally do not include contributions from emission lines .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to correct the emission - line contaminations for the magnitudes when we compare the predicted colors from stellar population models with the observed ones ( as what we will do in section 5 ) .",
    "we use the magnitudes computed from the galaxy spectra to correct emission - line contaminations for the magnitudes .",
    "the magnitude difference estimated from the spectra before and after removing the emission lines ( denoted as @xmath47 ) represents the correction inside the fiber . assuming the contribution of emission lines to the total magnitude equals to that in the fiber ) than that in the inner part , our method may * underestimate * the emission - line contamination . on the other hand , due to the contribution of agn in the nuclear region of massive galaxies , our method may * overestimate * the emission - line contamination .",
    "] , the sum of petrosian magnitude and @xmath47 can be regarded as emission - free magnitude and the colors estimated from this set of magnitudes are treated as emission - line - free colors .",
    "3 presents distributions of emission - line corrections for magnitudes and colors in the fiber .",
    "it can be seen that , although the corrections for the magnitudes are small , emission lines do influence the colors .",
    "although dust attenuation in face - on late - type galaxy is not expected to be large , it may have significant effect on the colors .",
    "it would be helpful if the influence of dust can be estimated and accounted for .",

    "this is expected since luminous galaxy is more attenuated and reddened than less luminous object ( tully et al .",
    "1998 ; masters et al . 2003 ) . after correcting the dust attenuation , the optical colors ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath56 ) for faint galaxies ( i.e. @xmath67 ) have very weak correlation with the luminosity , while the optical colors for bright galaxies ( i.e. @xmath1 ) are redder for more luminous galaxies .",

    "stellar mass is another fundamental physical parameter for galaxies .",
    "now , we turn to investigate the color - mass relations for late - type galaxies .",

    "the best - fit mean of color and its dispersion in each bin are listed in table 2 and plotted in fig .",
    "the most remarkable feature of fig .",
    "6 is the tightness of correlation between optical - infrared color ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) and stellar mass , in the sense that @xmath65 is nearly ( if not more than ) more than 3 times the mean color dispersion .",
    "we will discuss the implication of these results in section 5 .",
    "it could be interesting to compare the cmrs with color - mass relations .",
    "the colors show similar but stronger correlations with stellar mass than luminosity .",
    "the colors in the reddest bins are redder and the colors in the bluest bins are bluer when mass is used instead of absolute magnitude .",
    "this is true for all wavelength bands .",
    "however , it s not completely clear how much of the steeper slopes and tighter scatter in color - mass relations relative to cmrs is driven by the color dependence of stellar @xmath70 values .",

    "this point is anyhow expected since high mass surface density corresponds to higher stellar mass for late - type galaxies ( shen et al .",
    "more interestingly , when @xmath74 is used in place of @xmath68 , the resulted s increases for optical color , while s decreases for optical - infrared and infrared colors .",
    "in other words , for late - type galaxies , the optical colors correlate more strongly with mass surface density than with stellar mass , while optical - infrared and infrared colors show stronger correlations with stellar mass .",
    "this is obviously different from what is obtained for early - type galaxies .",
    "chang et al . ( 2006 ) have shown that , for elliptical galaxies , all galaxy colors correlate more strongly with stellar mass than with mass surface density , which suggests that the star formation history of nearby elliptical galaxies is primarily determined by the mass of the system .",
    "since the age - metallicity degeneracy makes it difficult to directly deduce the property of stellar population from colors , it is instructive to break the age - metallicity degeneracy firstly , such as adopting the sps models , and then discuss the implications of various correlations on the star formation histories ( sfhs ) for late - type galaxies .",
    "motivated by the work of bell & de jong ( 2000 ) , we use a combination of optical and near - infrared broad - band colors for galaxies in our sample b to probe the stellar populations of late type galaxies . in other words",
    ", we generate a grid of model spectral energy distributions using sps models and estimate the model parameters by matching all the available photometry of the sample galaxies to the colors predicted by the sps models . by doing this , we are able to investigate the trends in the mean stellar age and metallicity as a function of stellar mass and mass surface density .",
    "we adopt the sps models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "the universal initial mass function is taken from chabrier ( 2003 ) .",
    "the lower and upper mass cut - offs are set as @xmath76=0.1m@xmath77 and @xmath78=100m@xmath77 , respectively .",
    "we use simplified sfhs and given metallicities to construct a grid of model colors .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) is parameterized by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a normalization constant which determines the total mass of the stellar population , @xmath81 is the star formation timescale , @xmath82 is the age of galaxy and is fixed as @xmath83 , @xmath84 characterizes the time delay for star formation . under the above assumptions , the mean age of the stellar population @xmath85",
    "is given by : @xmath86    therefore , the mean age of stellar population is determined by the combination of @xmath81 and @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath87 , the youngest mean age given by none - negative @xmath81 is around 4gyr , which corresponds to @xmath88 and the sfr increases with time . in this case",
    ", the stellar population is still too old to fit the colors of some observed blue galaxies . as an alternative ,",
    "we assume a none - zero @xmath84 , which insures that our models also include the youngest stellar populations .",
    "we assume @xmath89 during model calculations .",
    "this assumption is acceptable for two reasons .",
    "first , we focus only on the mean stellar age rather than details of sfh for each individual galaxy .",
    "fixing the relation between @xmath81 and @xmath84 will reduce the number of free parameters in the model .",
    "second , sps model has the advantage of giving robust relative ages and metallicities estimations ( see discussions in bell & de jong 2000 ) .",
    "we will emphasize the _ relative trends _ rather than the absolute values of ages and metallicities . indeed , test calculations show that the main conclusions are not sensitive to either the adopted form of sfh or the assumption @xmath90 .",
    "thus , there are two free parameters in the model : metallicity and @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath81 progresses from 0 to @xmath91 ( @xmath92gyr corresponds to the upper limit for @xmath93 ) smoothly .",
    "this results in the mean age of stellar population going from old to young .",
    "firstly , we generate a model grid of single - burst stellar population ( ssps ) for different metallicity by interpolating along the model metallicities .",
    "the range of the model metallicities is from @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "then , we generate a model grid for a number of @xmath81 values by integrating the ssps with a given metallicity .",
    "these models provide a set of model colors @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 denotes different color ) for a range of sfhs and metallicity .",
    "we match all the available colors of the galaxies to the colors predicted by the sps models and estimate the model parameters using @xmath98-fitting . for each @xmath81 and metallicity @xmath99 , the corresponding @xmath98",
    "is given by : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the observed error for color @xmath97 .",
    "the best model match @xmath102 is the one with the minimum @xmath98 value .",
    "we use the observed @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 colors in @xmath98-fitting .",
    "these colors are corrected by emission - line contamination and dust attenuation .",
    "since the estimated @xmath50 is model - dependent and may not be accurate for individual galaxy , we choose to correct an average trend of dust attenuation by fitting a linear relation between @xmath50 and @xmath68 , i.e. to estimate @xmath50 from stellar mass .",
    "in general , massive galaxies have larger dust attenuation .",
    "the results for @xmath98-fitting show that there are about 5 percent of galaxies with the minimum @xmath98 value located in either boundary of the model parameters @xmath81 and @xmath99 .",
    "we exclude these galaxies from further analysis below .",
    "[ t ]    fig .",
    "8 plots the model predictions of @xmath102 against stellar mass and mass surface density for galaxies in sample b. to show the distribution more clearly , we plot sets of contours to indicate the positions within which different fraction of total number of galaxies is contained .",
    "we also adopt the spearman rank - order test to quantify the significance of the relation and show the resulted correlation coefficient in the right corner of each panel . fig .",
    "8 shows that massive galaxies have older and higher metallicity stellar populations than less massive galaxies . in other words , not only the stellar metallicity but also the stellar mean age that contribute to the observed cmrs for late - type galaxies . to contrast",
    ", the cmrs of early - type galaxies are mainly ascribed to the metallicity effect : more luminous galaxies have redder colors because they have higher metallicities ( faber 1977 ; dressler 1984 ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; kodama & arimoto 1997 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; de lucia et al .",
    "2004 ; kang et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the general trend for mass - metallicity relation found in this paper is similar to some earlier works ( such as peltier & de grijs 1998 ; bell & de jong 2000 ) .",
    "moreover , gas - phase oxygen abundance in star - forming galaxy has already been found to be related to the luminosity or / and stellar mass of the system ( kobulnicky & zaritsky 1999 ; kobulnivky & kewley 2004 ; hammer et al .",
    "2005 ; liang et al .",
    "2004 ; 2006 etc . ) . for comparison , we show the observed mass - metallicity relation presented by tremonti et al.(2004 ) with three blue lines .",
    "to transfer @xmath103 to @xmath104 , we assume the metallicity @xmath99 can be represented by oxygen abundance and take the solar value as 8.8 ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) .",
    "since the metallicity derived from sps models is the mean value of the stellar population , it is reasonable that the model predicted mettallicty is somewhat lower than that of tremonti et al .",
    "as we can see , the general trend of our results deduced from the cmrs are consistent with their independent measurements from emission lines .",
    "more interestingly , it can be seen ( even by eye ) that the metallicity correlates more strongly with @xmath68 than @xmath74 .",
    "we also find that the residuals from the age-@xmath74 relation do not correlate with @xmath68 , while the residuals from the age-@xmath68 relation increase with @xmath74 .",
    "all these suggest that the stellar mass of late - type galaxy is the primary parameter to determine the mean metallicity of the system .",
    "this is probably , similar as early - type galaxy , because the stellar mass strongly correlates to the potential well of the galaxy and then determines the efficiency for ejecting the metals of the system .",
    "tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also interpret their results as strong evidence of both the ubiquity of galactic winds and their effectiveness in removing metals from galaxy potential wells .    on the other hand ,",
    "the resulted mean stellar age @xmath85 is more sensitive to @xmath74 than @xmath68 .",
    "it is also found that the residuals from the metallicity-@xmath74 relation strongly correlate with @xmath68 , while the residuals from the metallicity-@xmath68 relation have no correlation with @xmath74 . in other words ,",
    "our results suggest that mass surface density plays an more important role in regulating the star formation history of late - type galaxy than stellar mass . indeed , some early studies already pointed out that the star formation history for late - type galaxies correlates more strongly with mass surface density than stellar mass ( bell & de jong 2000 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "2003b ; 2006 ) .",
    "kennicutt ( 1998 ) also shows that it is local ( e.g. surface density ) rather than global factors ( e.g. stellar mass ) that regulate the rate at which spiral galaxies form their stars at the present day .",
    "we have collected two samples of face - on late - type galaxies to investigate the correlations between colors and absolute magnitude , stellar mass and stellar mass surface density .",
    "sample a is selected from dr4 of sdss and sample b is a position matched sample between sdss ( dr4 ) and 2mass . in order to correct the aperture mismatch between sdss and 2mass",
    ", we use the radial profile of sdss galaxies and correct the sdss magnitudes to the isophotal circular radius where the 2mass magnitudes are measured .",
    "the emission - line contamination is corrected for the magnitudes by comparing the magnitudes computed from the spectra before and after removing the emission lines .",
    "we also correct dust attenuation by adopting @xmath50 estimation plus an standard kind of attenuation curve .",
    "moreover , we match the observed colors of our sample to the colors predicted by stellar population synthesis model and investigate their implications of the stellar populations .",
    "we find that :    1 .",
    "the optical colors for faint galaxies ( i.e. @xmath105 ) have very weak correlation with the luminosity , while the optical colors for bright galaxies ( i.e. @xmath1 ) are redder for more luminous galaxies .",
