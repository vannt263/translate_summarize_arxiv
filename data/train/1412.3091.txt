    "several years ago , @xcite and @xcite reported on galaxies whose black hole masses , @xmath0 , appeared under - massive relative to expectations based on their stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath12 .",
    "this apparent sub - structure in the @xmath13@xmath12 diagram @xcite was due to barred galaxies located , on average , 0.3 dex in the @xmath14-direction below the @xmath0@xmath12 relation defined by barless galaxies .",
    "@xcite subsequently revealed that galaxies with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) also display this same general separation in the @xmath0@xmath12 diagram , supporting the earlier introduction of barred- , barless- , and elliptical - galaxy @xmath0@xmath12 relations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was noted from the start that either the black hole masses could be low in the barred galaxies , or that an elevated velocity dispersion may account for their apparent offset in the @xmath13@xmath12 diagram .",
    "@xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have recently used simulations to demonstrate that the observed offset is an expected result from bar dynamics , which inflate the measured velocity dispersion by exactly the amount observed @xcite .",
    "given that this can fully account for the offsets in the @xmath0@xmath12 diagram , it implies that the barred galaxies do not possess under - massive black holes , and thus should not be offset in the black hole mass  spheroid mass ( @xmath0@xmath15 ) diagram .    a few recent papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have , however , shown that there is an offset at the low mass end of the @xmath0@xmath16 diagram , such that the black hole mass is lower than predicted by the near - linear @xmath0@xmath15 relation established using galaxies having predominantly higher mass black holes .",
    "these offset galaxies have been labelled by some to contain pseudobulges  spheroidal components thought to be produced by the secular evolution of a disk and associated with bars @xcite .",
    "this would agree with one of the scenarios@xmath15 diagram if secular evolution disproportionately increases the central bulge mass relative to the growth of the black hole .",
    "] presented by @xcite and @xcite , and subsequently @xcite , but if correct would present a contradiction with the picture presented in the preceding paragraph .",
    "pseudobulges are , however , particularly difficult to reliably identify @xcite because they can possess the same physical properties as low - mass , merger - built bulges , including srsic ( 1968 ) index , rotation , the presence of embedded discs , and a systematic departure from the bright end of any scaling relation which has used effective radii or ` effective ' surface brightnesses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    to address the above contradiction , and bypass the issue of pseudobulges",
    ", we start by noting that the near - linear scaling relations between @xmath0 and host spheroid luminosity @xmath3 , and also host spheroid stellar mass @xmath1 , @xcite@xmath17 relationship proposed by @xcite pertains to the limit in massive spheroids , and it is effectively the relationship for which @xcite and @xcite later provided the zero - point . ]",
    "have recently been shown by @xcite to provide an incomplete description of the ( black hole)spheroid relationship .",
    "in essence , the @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath19 @xcite scaling relations for `` srsic spheroids '' necessitates a non - linear @xmath0-@xmath3 and @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",
    "srsic spheroids are elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disk galaxies which do not have partially depleted cores ; they typically have @xmath20-band absolute magnitudes @xmath21 mag , and srsic indices @xmath224 .",
    "graham ( 2012 ) pointed out that in these spheroids one expects to find that @xmath23 and that the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 should be better described by a near - quadratic relation than a linear relation , as was further shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as noted in these works , it is only at high masses ( @xmath24 ) that a near - linear @xmath0-@xmath1 relation is evident , giving rise to this broken scaling relation .",
    "although , due to the scatter in the @xmath0@xmath15 diagram , coupled with the location of the brighter srsic galaxies at the high - mass end of the near - quadratic @xmath0-@xmath1 relation , surveys which have not sufficiently probed below @xmath25 can readily miss the bend in the @xmath0@xmath15 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a steeper than linear , although not bent , relation was however detected early - on @xcite , and a number of recent theoretical works have now revealed a steepening relationship at lower masses @xcite , although ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure  22 ) does not .",
    "this would appear to be bringing things more in line with the prediction by @xcite that @xmath26 .",
    "these scaling relationships are important for several reasons .",
    "given the broken , or rather bent , @xmath0-@xmath1 relation , it implies that , within the srsic galaxies , the supermassive black holes grow more rapidly than the stellar spheroids @xcite .",
    "that is , there is no tandem , lockstep , growth of black holes and bulges in these galaxies : the @xmath0/@xmath1 mass ratio is not a constant value . indeed , while this ( previously thought to be constant ) ratio was doubled in @xcite for the massive galaxies , and then increased further to an _ average _ value of 0.49% in the core - srsic galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see laor 2001 ) , it can be lower than @xmath27 in the lower - mass srsic galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also wandel 1999 ) .",
    "low - mass spheroids therefore offer an even more promising domain , than previously thought when assuming a constant @xmath0/@xmath1 mass ratio of 0.140.2% ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , to find new intermediate mass black holes , i.e.   those with @xmath28 .",
    "an additional , related , reason pertains to feedback from supermassive black holes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which is commonly thought to regulate star formation in the spheroid and provide a potential solution to the over - abundance of massive galaxies predicted by dark - matter only simulations .",
    "this process has been invoked to produce the turn - off in the galaxy luminosity function at high luminosities ( e.g.  @xcite ) . as noted",
    ", the near - quadratic @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for srsic spheroids flattens into a slope close to unity for the brighter core - srsic galaxies @xcite .",
    "the presence of a partially - depleted core in these bigger spheroids is thought to indicate that they and their black hole formed through simple , additive , dry major merger events which created the near - linear ( one - to - one ) @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",
    "the process of `` mechanical '' or `` radio mode '' agn feedback may therefore subsequently maintain , rather than establish , this linear relation    here we investigate if galaxies with agn hosting low mass black holes that have been reported in the literature to be offset from the _ near - linear _ @xmath0-@xmath29 relation ( defined by predominantly massive spheroids ) might simply be following the steeper relation of the srsic galaxies .",
    "if so , then they may not be discrepant galaxies with unusually low @xmath0/@xmath29 mass ratios , but rather abide by the main relation defined by the majority of galaxies today .",
    "this will have dramatic implications for cosmological hydrodynamical simulations , such as illustris @xcite , which have tied themselves to the near - linear @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",
    "our study has been performed by using data from many authors , thereby avoiding possible biases in any one study , and deriving spheroid stellar masses when not done in the original papers . in section",
    "2 we introduce the galaxy / black hole samples used , and in section  3 we present their location in the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram .",
    "section  4 provides a discussion of related topics such as formation theories , expectations for intermediate mass black holes , coexistence with nuclear star clusters , and potential evolutionary pathways for possible under- and over - massive black holes .",
    "our initial reference sample consists of 75 galaxies with directly measured supermassive black hole masses and spheroid stellar mass determinations @xcite .",
    "the stellar masses were obtained by applying the ( @xmath30) ( stellar mass - to - light ratio ) relation from @xcite to the @xmath31-band magnitudes of the 75 spheroids .",
    "the initial galaxy magnitudes came from the archangel photometry pipeline @xcite applied to two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass * ? ? ? * ) images .",
    "inspection of the galaxy images ( savorgnan et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "has since resulted in 3 changes of morphological type : ngc  5845 ( e @xmath32 s0 , with clear rotation seen by @xcite ) ; ngc  2974 ( e @xmath32 s0a , with faint spiral arms evident ) ; and ngc  4388 ( sb @xmath32 sbcd , due to a substantial edge - on bar that had inflated past bulge estimates ) .",
    "this resulted in the following revised @xmath30 colors and @xmath31-band magnitudes for their bulges : ( ngc  5845 : 3.85 , -21.84 mag ) ; ( ngc  2974 : 3.66 , -22.88 mag ) ; and ( ngc  4388 : 3.72 , -22.14 mag ) , and thus new spheroid masses following eq.2 from @xcite .",
    "these are shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the presence , or otherwise , of a partially - depleted stellar core in the full sample was primarily determined from high resolution hubble space telescope imaging . here",
    "we reclassify ngc  1332 and ngc  3998 as srsic galaxies based on their light profiles @xcite , whereas in @xcite and @xcite these galaxies had been tentatively classified as core - srsic galaxies based on their central velocity dispersion . in passing we note that ngc  1332 is a massive ( @xmath33 ) , compact ( @xmath34 kpc ) early - type galaxy ( savorgnan et al .  in prep .",
    ") , with structural properties similar to ngc  1277 .",
    "such galaxies , with properties similar to some at @xmath35 , have been claimed to be very rare in the universe today ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also now expand our reference sample through the addition of ngc  1316 ( fornax  a , @xmath36 , m@xmath37 mag , following @xcite ) .",
    "although we had a measurement of its black hole mass and an estimate of its bulge magnitude in @xcite , we were uncertain as to whether it was a core - srsic or a srsic galaxy .",
    "unbeknown to us at the time , @xcite had however revealed the presence of a kinematically cold , nuclear stellar disk with a radius less than 200 pc in this peculiar , barred lenticular galaxy , expanding on the discovery by @xcite . at odds with the initial classification in @xcite , ngc  1316",
    "therefore does not posses a partially - depleted stellar core .",
    "finally , @xcite have provided a stellar mass estimate for the bulge of the milky way , enabling us to also now include our own galaxy .",
    "we have taken the associated black hole mass from @xcite .",
    "this gives us a final sample of 77 galaxies with directly measured black hole masses .",
    "the changes since @xcite that are mentioned above are captured in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "it is also noted that four of the galaxies listed there have particularly high @xmath38 ratios .",
    "given the small degree of change to the initial sample of 75 galaxies , we do not re - derive the @xmath0@xmath15 scaling relations given in @xcite for the core - srsic and srsic galaxies .",
    "it is however noted that the denominator in equation  4 from @xcite , pertaining to the srsic galaxies , contains a typographical error and should read @xmath39 rather than @xmath40 .",

    "it is possible that both tidal stripping and continued srsic - mode growth played a role in ngc  4486b , with its black hole growing unusually large through continued srsic - mode growth , and then being stripped of its stars through a tidal interaction",
    ". of course , the reported black masses in ngc  1277 and ngc  4486b may simply be in error .",
    "this could happen due to velocity shear from an unresolved rotating disk which elevates the central velocity dispersion , as noted in @xcite .",
    "other possible pathways for producing outliers in the @xmath0@xmath1 diagram are less well explored .",
    "mechanisms for feeding gas onto a central black hole , while avoiding significant star formation include : accretion from a dense , flat , gaseous disk or bar @xcite , ultra - fast outflows @xcite from agn with sub - eddington accretion rates leading to enhanced black hole growth @xcite or the accretion of stellar in addition to gaseous material , leading to optical or ultra - violet flaring events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is unclear whether the effect of any of these mechanisms on a galaxy s position in the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation would be significant , and further theoretical work is required to better understand the potential affect of these mechanisms and why they might preferentially exist in some galaxies  perhaps those with substantial central gas drag and nuclear star clusters or discs .",
    "alternatively , a galaxy s gas supply may be removed by an external force before its black hole grows large enough to remove that gas itself .",
    "this could be accomplished by environmental effects such as ram pressure stripping @xcite or the influence of a nearby agn @xcite .",
    "once the gas is gone , the galaxy and black hole could , through dry mergers , grow parallel to the dry merging / core - srsic track in figure [ fig2 ] , populating the lower right part of the diagram .",
    "we have collated data from seven different studies of low mass agn .",
    "we have unified their black hole mass derivations , and , when necessary , estimated the host spheroid s stellar mass . by combining this data , it is apparent in the @xmath0@xmath1 diagram that it does not represent a collection of data pairs in which the black hole mass is randomly low , relative to the near - linear @xmath0@xmath1 relation for core - srsic galaxies .",
    "such a scenario might be expected if the agn reside in pseudobulges in which the black hole growth is lagging that of the pseudobulge  an idea floated in @xcite and @xcite . simply because a galaxy resides below the near linear @xmath13@xmath90 relation",
    "does not imply that it is an offset pseudobulge .",
    "instead , the agn with @xmath204 roughly overlap with the cloud of ( predominantly inactive ) srsic galaxies which define a near- or super - quadratic @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "they do however reside on the high @xmath1 edge of this cloud , _ possibly _ indicating that their spheroid masses have been over - estimated by us due to use of an overly large mass - to - light ratio conversion factor .",
    "the spheroids hosting agn with @xmath205 closely track this relation to lower masses .",
    "they also reveal that the ( horizontal ) scatter in the @xmath206 direction is comparable at low and high masses . as such , the recent identification of separate scaling relations for srsic and core - srsic galaxies appears to explain many of the black holes in agn once thought to be under - massive .    through improvements in the quality of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data , which are expected to be achievable in the near future via refined virial factors , bulge / disc / bar decompositions of galaxy light , and stellar mass - to - light ratios , we hope to further study the coevolution of black holes with their host galaxy .",
    "this will include determining if agn may be offset from the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for srsic galaxies defined by largely inactive galaxies , and exploration into the realm of intermediate mass black holes .",

    "<S> we show that this steeper , quadratic - like @xmath0@xmath1 relation defined by the srsic galaxies , i.e.  galaxies without partially depleted cores , roughly tracks the apparent offset of the agn having @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , these agn are not randomly offset with low black hole masses , but also follow a steeper ( non - linear ) relation . as noted by busch et al . </S>",
    "<S> , confirmation or rejection of a possible agn offset from the steeper @xmath0-@xmath1 relation defined by the srsic galaxies will benefit from improved stellar mass - to - light ratios for the spheroids hosting these agn . </S>",
    "<S> several implications for formation theories are noted . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , reasons for possible under- and over - massive black holes , the potential existence of intermediate mass black holes ( @xmath10 ) , and the new steep ( black hole)(nuclear star cluster ) relation , @xmath11 , are also discussed . </S>"
