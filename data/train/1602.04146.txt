    "the problem of distributed control for strings of dynamical agents can be seen as a particular instance of flocking for multi - agent systems .",
    "the flocking problem has been intensively studied in the last decade for agents with linear @xcite or nonlinear @xcite dynamics .",
    "generally speaking , two important features characterize the flocking behavior of autonomous agents : cohesion and collision avoidance . in multi - agent systems",
    "they are implemented as connectivity / topology preservation @xcite and collision avoidance @xcite , respectively .",
    "while these features are sufficient for reasonable flocking behavior , in the control of strings ( also known as platooning ) it is essential to add a supplementary requirement related to avoiding the amplification of oscillations through the formation , phenomenon known as _ string instability _ @xcite .",
    "even if string instability is circumvented , supplemental problems may be caused by the so called accordion effect ( or slinky effect ) consisting of weakly attenuated oscillations and long settling times of the relative positions and velocities of the vehicles .",
    "both string instability and the slinky effect are consequences of the notorious lack of scalability of networks of dynamical agents .",
    "this lack of scalability causes the performance of the control scheme to depend on the number of vehicles in formations and also on the vehicle s position in formation . for the case of lti agents , a novel distributed control architecture that can guarantee string stability even for distance  based headways and can also guarantee perfect trajectory tracking ( _ i.e. _ the complete elimination of the slinky effect ) in the presence of bounded disturbances and communications delays , has been recently proposed in @xcite .    for many important applications in networks of dynamical agents ,",
    "the regulated signals in trajectory tracking or synchronization problems represent relative measurements such as interspacing distances , relative velocities ( with respect to neighboring agents ) or phase differences between ( neighboring ) coupled oscillators . in this paper , we present preliminary results on a class of novel distributed control policies where the relative measurements ( with respect to the neighboring agents ) are used by the local sub  controllers in conjunction with the knowledge of the control actions of the sub - controllers at the neighboring agents .",
    "it turns out that the performance of the resulting distributed control schemes vastly outperforms the distributed architectures based solely on relative measurements . in this work ,",
    "the dynamical models of the agents are taken to be non  linear and time invariant , satisfying a global lipschitz  like condition .",
    "such models represent an effective framework for describing the dynamics of the transmission block of road vehicles , from the break / throttle controls to the vehicle s position on the roadway . for illustrative simplicity",
    ", we only look at the scenario of identical agents for which the formation graph is a string , however the proposed scheme could be adapted to multi  tree ( no self ",
    "loops ) graphs , once that the relative errors are defined adequately in order to avoid the well  known formation rigidity problems @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the string formation alone has important applications , as it addresses the longstanding platooning problem , which is paramount to the autonomous vehicles industry .",
    "the problem considered in this paper can be rephrased as a multi - agent flocking problem with collision avoidance .",
    "the literature on this topic is very rich and considers both directed or undirected , fixed or time - varying interconnection graphs .",
    "the objective of the control scheme is to achieve the synchronization of the trajectories of all agents in the formation with the trajectory of the leader agent .",
    "such trajectory tracking must be achieved while ensuring zero ( steady  state ) errors of the regulated measures ( in our case the relative speed between two consecutive agents ) and while avoiding collisions , _",
    "i.e. _ performing the needed longitudinal steering ( brake / throttle ) maneuvers that guarantee the avoidance of collision with the preceding vehicle .",
    "the approach taken here is based on the use of artificial potential functions @xcite in the formulation of the _ local _ control laws . when compared to the state - of - the - art ,",
    "our results represent a consistent extension of the ones in @xcite , from at least two perspectives .",
    "firstly , it guarantees stability , velocity matching ( trajectory tracking ) and collision avoidance even for _ directed topologies _ , as illustrated by the distributed control scheme reported here .",
    "secondly , it achieves complete _ scalability _ with respect to the number of agents in formation @xcite ( which is a daunting requirement for platooning systems , even in the case of lti agents ) and also with respect to the connectivity of the communications graph .    by comparison",
    ", the main result in @xcite imposes that all the minor matrices of the weighted laplacian matrix associated with the interconnection graph are positive definite and lower bounded by a certain constant .",
    "this practically requires the maximization of the eigenvalues of the weighted laplacian matrix , which can be interpreted as the maximization of the number of interconnections in the underlined graph ( see @xcite ) together with the maximization of its diagonal elements ( see gergorin disk theorem @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the first requirement involves the transmission of the exact state of the leader to many agents in the formation , while the second requirement represents high local control gains .    the most interesting feature of our proposed scheme is the fact that it achieves complete _ scalability _ with respect to the number of vehicles in the string .",
    "the scalability does not result from the tuning of the local sub ",
    "controllers @xcite , as it is a structural property for the class of all stabilizing controllers and it is a consequence of the complete `` decoupling '' of a certain bounded approximation of the closed  loop equations .",
    "this allows the study of the closed ",
    "loop stability by performing solely individual , local analyses of the closed ",
    "loops stability at each agent , which in turn guarantee the aggregated stability of the formation .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section  ii we introduce the general framework and we formulate the platooning control problem .",
    "section  iii provides a preliminary description of the novel distributed control architecture introduced in this work along with a first glimpse at the closed - loop dynamics `` decoupling '' featured by the control scheme .",
    "section  iv contains the main result as it delineates the guarantees for stability , velocity matching and collision avoidance .",
    "the @xmath0norm of a vector @xmath1 is defined as @xmath2\\ ] ] with @xmath0 is a positive constant .",
    "this is a class @xmath3 function of @xmath4 and is differentiable everywhere .",
    "a set @xmath5 is said to be _ forward invariant _ with respect to an equation ,",
    "if any solution @xmath6 of the equation satisfies : @xmath7    [ apf ] artificial potential function ( apf ) .",
    "the function @xmath8 is a differentiable , nonnegative , radially unbounded function of @xmath9 satisfying the following properties :    * ( i ) * @xmath10 as @xmath11 ,    * ( ii ) * @xmath12 has a unique minimum , which is attained at @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being a positive constant .",
    "we consider a _",
    "homogeneous _ group of @xmath15 agents ( _ e.g. _ autonomous road vehicles ) moving along the same ( positive ) direction of a roadway , with the origin at the starting point of the leader . the dynamical model for the agents , relating the control signal @xmath16 of the @xmath17th vehicle to its position @xmath18 on the roadway , is given by    [ dacia ] @xmath19 @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the instantaneous speed of the @xmath17th agent , @xmath16 is its command signal and @xmath22 is the initial interspacing distance between the @xmath17th agent and its predecessor in the string . throughout the sequel we will use the notation @xmath23 to denote ( especially for the graphical representations ) the input  output operator @xmath24 of the dynamical system from ( [ nlin ] ) , with the initial conditions ( [ initcond ] ) .    [ lider ]",
    "the index `` @xmath25 '' is reserved for the _ leader vehicle _ , the first vehicle in the string , for which we assume that there is no controller on board and consequently the command signal @xmath26 will represent a _ reference _ signal for the entire formation .",
    "we further define @xmath27 to be the interspacing and relative velocity error signals respectively ( with respect to the predecessor in the string ) . by differentiating the first equation in ( [ z ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath28 , therefore implying that constant interspacing errors ( in steady state ) are equivalent with zero relative velocity errors and also allowing to write the following time evolution for the relative velocity error of the @xmath17th vehicle @xmath29",
    "the inherent difficulty in platooning control is rooted in the _ nested _ nature of the interdependencies between the regulated signals . specifically , the regulated errors ( _ e.g. _ interspacing errors or relative velocity errors ) at the @xmath17th agent depend on the regulated errors of its predecessor ( the @xmath30th agent ) and so on , such that by a recursive argument  going through all the predecessors of the @xmath17th agent  they ultimately depend on the trajectory of the leader vehicle , which represents the reference for the entire formation .        we introduce a novel control architecture featuring a certain beneficial `` decoupling '' properties of the closed  loop dynamics that avoid the pitfalls of the aforementioned _ nested _ interdependencies .",
    "the distributed control policies rely only on information locally available to each vehicle . for the scope of this paper ,",
    "we consider non  linear controllers built on the so - called artificial potential functions ( apf ) , in particular we will look at control laws of the type @xmath31 with @xmath32 , where each of the @xmath8 functions is an artificial potential function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition  7 ) with @xmath33 being a proportional gain to be designed for supplemental performance requirements . with the notation from ( [ z ] ) , the control policy ( [ ours ] ) for the @xmath17th vehicle becomes @xmath34 and it can further be written as the sum of the following two components : firstly , the control signal @xmath35 of the preceding vehicle , which is received onboard the @xmath17th vehicle via wireless communications ( _ e.g. _ digital radio )",
    ". secondly , the _ local _ component , which we denote with @xmath36 and which is based on the measurements ( [ z ] ) which are _ locally _ available to the @xmath17th vehicle , as they can be acquired via onboard lidar sensors .",
    "thus , the @xmath17th control law reads : @xmath37    by further denoting with @xmath38 the input  output operator in ( [ figurehelper ] ) from @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , to @xmath41 , namely @xmath42 the resulted control architecture for any two consecutive vehicles ( @xmath43 ) can be pictured as in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "note that due to the assumed homogeneity of the formation , the wirelessly received predecessor control signal @xmath35 appears unfiltered in ( [ oursbis ] ) . for the illustrative simplicity of the exposition , we look only at the scenario in which there are no communications induced delays . a ( gps  time based )",
    "synchronization mechanism that can cope with the communications induced time ",
    "delays will be addressed in future work .",
    "the control policy ( [ ours ] ) entails a highly beneficial `` decoupling '' feature of the closed ",
    "loop dynamics at each agent , as we simply illustrate next .",
    "firstly , note that by plugging ( [ ours ] ) into ( [ primo ] ) we obtain the following closed  loop error equations at the @xmath17th agent : @xmath44    the following result will be instrumental in the sequel . consider the following lyapunov candidate functions : @xmath45    [ instrumental - lemma ] the differential of the lyapunov candidate function @xmath46 introduced in along the trajectories of ( [ dacia ] ) and ( [ ours ] ) is given by @xmath47 and does not depend on the particular choice of the apfs @xmath8 .",
    "differentiating the apf @xmath8 at the @xmath17th agent with respect to time , yields @xmath48 and by employing the anti  symmetrical property of apfs @xcite : @xmath49 @xmath50 we get that @xmath51 therefore from ( [ lk ] ) it follows that @xmath52    a preliminary framework in which the advantages of the closed  lop decoupling become apparent is illustrated by the following result .",
    "local _ stabilization at the @xmath17th agent is achieved irrespective of the dynamics involved at any other agents in the string and without invoking any stability arguments for the entire formation .",
    "[ concave ] let the real function @xmath53 in ( [ nlin ] ) be concave and differentiable , with its differential @xmath54 upper - bounded by a given constant @xmath55 .",
    "then , the controller guarantees the stability of @xmath25 as an equilibrium point of the decoupled system as far as @xmath56 .",
    "let us notice @xmath57 and since @xmath54 is upper - bounded by a given constant @xmath55 , we get @xmath58 therefore , along the trajectory of the closed  loop error system the following holds @xmath59 using gronwall s lemma the stability of @xmath25 as an equilibrium point of the decoupled system is ensured by the stability of @xmath25 as an equilibrium point for @xmath60 the derivative of the lyapunov function @xmath61 defined in along the trajectory of can be computed following the prof of lemma as @xmath62 the proof ends by remarking that @xmath56 guarantees that @xmath63 .",
    "as we will show in this section , our methodology needs only information from the predecessor without employing any information from the leader agent .",
    "while the control gains are strictly related to the reactivity of the system ( _ i.e. _ faster systems needs higher controller gains ) our scheme does not require making the leader s information ( instantaneous speed or acceleration ) available to all other vehicles in the string ( the virtual leaders from @xcite ) , rendering our approach more suited to practical platooning applications .",
    "our directed communications scheme , necessitates a minimal information exchange and sensing radius for all agents ( each agent performs measurements and receives information only with respect to its predecessor ) .",
    "the following result is the main result of this section , as it delineates a `` decoupling '' property of the closed ",
    "loop dynamics , achieved by the ( [ ours ] ) type control policy along with velocity matching and collision avoidance .",
    "[ nostra ] if the function @xmath53 from ( [ nlin ] ) satisfies the global lipshitz  like condition ( * ? ? ? * assumption  1 ) @xmath64 then for all type control laws with that @xmath65 the following hold : * ( a ) * given the lyapunov function @xmath61 introduced in ( [ lk ] ) , _ local _ to the @xmath17-th agent , the sub  level sets @xmath66 of @xmath61 are compact and they represent forward invariant sets for the _ local _ closed  loop dynamics ( [ secundo ] ) of the @xmath17th vehicle . + * ( b ) * the controller guarantees velocity matching and collision avoidance .",
    "furthermore , considering @xmath67 there exists @xmath68 such that @xmath69 therefore , a pre ",
    "specified safety distance can be imposed by the initial conditions .    * ( a ) * we show that the _ local _ sub  level sets @xmath70 of @xmath61 are compact . note that @xmath71 implies that @xmath72 and @xmath73 . since @xmath74 is radially unbounded this implies that @xmath75 is bounded and consequently @xmath76 is bounded .",
    "therefore @xmath77 is a bounded set .",
    "moreover due to continuity of @xmath78 and @xmath79 one obtains that @xmath80 is a closed set .",
    "precisely @xmath80 is the pre - image of a closed set through a continuous function . in the banach space",
    "@xmath81 it therefore holds that @xmath80 is closed and bounded thus @xmath80 is compact .",
    "furthermore , point * ( a ) * and the lipschitz  like assumption ( [ lipsha ] ) on @xmath53 implies that @xmath82 along the trajectories of ( [ secundo ] ) .",
    "therefore it suffices to choose the controller gain @xmath65 in order to guarantee that @xmath83 along the trajectories of ( [ secundo ] ) and that @xmath80 is a forward invariant set for the decoupled closed  loop system , local to the @xmath17-th vehicle . + * ( b ) * from the properties of the apf it follows that @xmath84 when @xmath85 .",
    "consequently , @xmath86 denote with @xmath87 and so for @xmath65 it holds that @xmath80 is forward invariant yielding @xmath88 .",
    "this implies that @xmath89 and using we conclude that @xmath90 .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath68 is implicitly defined by @xmath91 , which in turn depends on the initial condition .",
    "therefore , the interspacing distance @xmath68 between @xmath30-th and @xmath17-th vehicles is imposed by the initial condition @xmath92 .",
    "finally , by employing lasalle s invariance principle we conclude that the lyapunov function @xmath61 converges asymptotically to its minimum ( _ i.e. _ @xmath93 ) and consequently @xmath40 converges to @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the velocity matching is guaranteed .",
    "given @xmath46 as introduced in ( [ lk ] ) , the string formation s steady  state configuration is attained at the minimum of the following formation - level lyapunov function : @xmath94 which coincides component  wise with the minima of the lyapunov functions ( [ lk ] ) _ local _ to the @xmath17-th agent . furthermore , the level sets of @xmath95 given by @xmath96 are compact and they represent forward invariant sets for the closed ",
    "loop dynamics of the entire formation , as given in ( [ dacia ] ) and ( [ ours ] ) with @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , velocity matching and vehicles collision avoidance are achieved , _ without the need for inserting exact leader information in the formation _",
    "( virtual leaders ) while maintaining a safe interspacing distance .",
    "it follows from the definition of ( [ l ] ) and lemma [ instrumental - lemma ] that along the trajectories of ( [ dacia ] ) and ( [ ours ] ) one has @xmath98 let us notice that @xmath99 is a finite cartesian product of the compacts @xmath80 , thus @xmath99 is compact .",
    "furthermore , designing the local controllers as in theorem  [ nostra ] it follows that @xmath99 is a forward invariant set for the closed ",
    "loop dynamics of the entire formation .",
    "consequently , without the need for inserting exact leader information in the formation , one guarantees the velocity matching and moreover from point * ( b ) * in theorem  [ nostra ] the vehicles maintain a strictly positive interspacing distance .",
