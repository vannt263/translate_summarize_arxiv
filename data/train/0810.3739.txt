    "the top quark is the heaviest known particle in the standard model .",
    "its mass is an important parameter to be determined , both for its intrinsic interest , and because precision measurements of the top quark mass , in conjunction with the @xmath6 boson mass , allow us to set constraints on the mass of the higgs boson within the standard model . in this letter",
    "we describe a precision measurement of the top quark mass using a matrix element integration method .",
    "this measurement uses 2.7 fb@xmath2 of data collected by the cdf ii detector .",
    "we obtain a top mass measurement by integrating over unmeasured quantities in the matrix element using a quasi ",
    "monte carlo integration .",
    "this allows us to minimize assumptions made about the kinematics of an event , resulting in improved precision .",
    "the integration method yields a likelihood curve as a function of the top pole mass .",
    "the largest source of systematic uncertainty in our measurement is the jet energy scale ( jes ) . to reduce our uncertainty due to this source",
    ", we introduce an additional parameter to our likelihood , @xmath7 , which allows us to use the information in the @xmath6 decay to determine the jes .",
    "@xmath7 parameterizes the shift in jes in units of the systematic error for a given jet .",
    "our likelihood is thus constructed as a 2d function of @xmath3 and @xmath7 ; we then combine the likelihoods for all events and eliminate @xmath7 as a nuisance parameter to find a final top mass value .",
    "at the fermilab tevatron , top quarks are predominantly produced in @xmath8 pairs , where the @xmath9 decays into a @xmath6 boson and a @xmath10 quark @xmath11 100% of the time .",
    "the @xmath6 can then decay into a charged lepton and a neutrino ( `` leptonic '' decay ) or a quark - antiquark pair ( `` hadronic '' decay ) .",
    "we search for events in the `` lepton + jets '' channel , where one @xmath6 decays hadronically and one leptonically .",
    "thus , we analyze events with four high - energy jets ( two from the @xmath10 quarks and two from the hadronic @xmath6 decay ) , at least one of which is required to be @xmath10-tagged using a secondary vertex algorithm which identifies tracks displaced from the primary vertex ; exactly one high energy electron or muon ( from the leptonic @xmath6 decay ) ; and large missing transverse energy ( from the neutrino ) .",
    "the principal backgrounds to our signal are events where a @xmath6 boson is produced in conjunction with heavy flavor jets ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 ) , a @xmath6 boson is produced with light jets which are mistagged as @xmath10-jets , and qcd events not containing a @xmath6 where the @xmath6 signature is faked .",
    "overall we expect 105.7 @xmath4 42.0 background events in our observed 494 candidate events . table  [ expected_backgrounds ] shows our expected backgrounds .",
    ".expected backgrounds for the @xmath6 + 4 tight jet sample used .",

    "we calculate a two - dimensional likelihood as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath7 by integrating over the matrix element for @xmath8 production and decay over the unknown parton - level quantities , using transfer functions to connect these with the measured jets .",
    "our overall likelihood formula is :    @xmath15    with @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the parton - level quantities , @xmath18 denotes the quantities measured in our detector , @xmath19 is the matrix element for @xmath8 production and decay , @xmath20 is the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the momenta of the two incoming particles , ff is the flux factor normalizing the pdfs , @xmath21 is a normalization factor , @xmath22 is an acceptance factor to correct for the effect of the event selection criteria , and @xmath23 is the parton - level phase space integrated over .",
    "the integral is evaluated for each of the 24 possible jet - parton assignments and then summed with appropriate weights corresponding to the probability that a given jet - parton assignment corresponds with the observed @xmath10-tags .",
    "we integrate over a total of 19 variables . in order to perform this integral in a practical amount of time ,",
    "we employ quasi ",
    "monte carlo integration  @xcite , which uses quasi - random sequences .",
    "these sequences provide more uniform coverage of the phase space , resulting in faster integral convergence than with normal monte carlo techniques .",
    "we use a neural network to identify events likely to be background , and subtract out their contribution to the total likelihood by estimating the average contribution for background events from monte carlo .",
    "we also consider the effect of events which we call `` bad signal '' .",
    "these are events which contain an actual @xmath8 decay , but where the final observed objects in our detector do not come directly from @xmath8 decay ( due to extra jets from initial or final state radiation , @xmath24 decay , or other causes ) . to reduce the effect of these poorly - modeled events ,",
    "we apply a cut of 10 to the peak of the log - likelihood curve .",
    "in monte carlo simulation , this cut eliminates 20% of `` bad signal '' events and 27% of background while retaining 97% of our good signal events .",
    "we test and calibrate our measurement using pythia monte carlo events over a variety of input @xmath3 and @xmath7 values by performing pseudo - experiments . using the results of the pseudo - experiments ,",
    "we obtain a final set of calibration constants for our measured top mass and statistical uncertainty .",
    "figure  [ calib ] shows the results of our monte carlo testing .",
    "figure  [ figures ] shows the effect of the likelihood cut on monte carlo events .",
    "we have 494 events passing our initial selection cuts , of which 422 events pass the likelihood cut as well . with these 422 events , we measure :           figure  [ figures ]",
    "shows the final contours of 1-@xmath25 , 2-@xmath25 , and 3-@xmath25 statistical uncertainty around the measured value .",
    "the total result attains a precision of better than 1% in @xmath3 .",
    "our main sources of systematic uncertainty are from the monte carlo generator used for our calibration and testing ( 0.5 gev/@xmath5 ) , the residual jes uncertainty resulting from variation of the individual sources of our total jes uncertainty ( 0.5 gev/@xmath5 ) , uncertainty from the modeling of the jet energy scale for @xmath10-jets ( 0.4 gev/@xmath5 ) , and uncertainty in the background model ( 0.4 gev/@xmath5 ) .",
    "we also have smaller uncertainties from initial - state and final - state radiation , lepton @xmath26 measurement , pileup events , calibration , and pdfs ( 0.3 , 0.2 , 0.2 , 0.1 , and 0.1 gev/@xmath5 , respectively ) , for a total of 1.0 gev/@xmath5 .",
