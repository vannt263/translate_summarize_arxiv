    "due to their importance in electronics technology , isolated defects in semiconductors and insulators have a long history .",
    "low doping levels , arising from isolated shallow defects , provide the carriers that make semiconductors a dominant technology in today s pervasive electronics environment .",
    "the primary shallow defects in the more important semiconductors for most applications ( si , gaas , ge ) have been extensively studied , and research turned to the study of deep levels ( states with energies well away from the edges , deep within the gap ) .",
    "an exploration by haldane and anderson@xcite demonstrated , considering intra - atomic repulsion using the multi - orbital anderson impurity in a model semiconductor treated in mean field , how multiple charge states can arise and be confined within the semiconducting gap .",
    "these charge states will , except accidentally , be deep levels , and when providing a carrier to the conduction band through thermal or electromagnetic excitation , they become deep donor levels .",
    "one of the suspected deep donor impurities in semiconductors , and seemingly the simplest , is interstitial h in an elemental semiconductor .",
    "ge and si can be prepared ultra - pure , and h possibly is the most common remaining impurity . in work that will be discussed in more detail later , pickett , cohen , and kittel@xcite ( pck ) provided evidence that interstitial h produces a _ hyperdeep donor _ level in ge , with the h @xmath0 donor state lying not within the gap but perhaps located as deep as 6 ev _ below _ the gap , near the center of the valence bands .",
    "their hands - on , self - consistent mean field treatment in the spirit of correlated band theory ( lda+u ) methods leaves much yet to be decided .",
    "pck provided a synopsis of the earlier models that had been applied to this h impurity question .",
    "several h - related defects have been observed@xcite in ge , and most seem to be defect complexes in which h is involved , rather than simply isolated h impurities . however , local vibrations were observed for isolated h , identified as ( near ) bond - centered and in the antibonding or tetrahedral sites,@xcite which is the impurity of interest here .",
    "similar questions exist for h impurities in the isovalent semiconductors si@xcite and diamond .",
    "since that early work , a few model studies have addressed the effects of local interactions at a single orbital impurity in a semiconducting host .",
    "yu and guerrero investigated a one - dimensional anderson model with an impurity using the density matrix renormalization group approach.@xcite the strength of the hybridization compared to the semiconducting gap determined whether the doped - hole density remained localized near the impurity or instead spread over many sites ( 25 sites in their study ) .",
    "additional holes were found to be spread throughout the system , avoiding the impurity region .",
    "the h in ge problem is a physical realization of the gapped anderson impurity model ( gaim ) studied by galpin and logan.@xcite they addressed the gaim with a self - consistent perturbation theory extended to all orders , and concluded that for the half - filled case such as we are in interested in here  neutral h in undoped ge  for any non - zero gap the interacting system is _ not _ perturbatively connected to the non - interacting system .",
    "this broad claim calls to mind the classic result of kohn and majumdar  separate but related , and with different connotations  that the properties of such a system ( in the non - interacting case ) are _ analytic _ in the strength of a local potential that drives a bound gap state across the gap edge to become a resonant state in the continuum.@xcite    from the earliest electronic structure studies involving h impurities in ge , most of the focus has been on defect complexes incorporating h with vacancies and other impurities .",
    "model studies@xcite gave way to a number of density functional theory ( dft ) based studies ; see refs . and for representative work .",
    "dft studies of isolated h in ge and other semiconductors have also been reported,@xcite giving indications that h provides in ge a shallow donor or shallow acceptor depending on its position ( see above ) , or that it is an example of a negative - u system because of instability of its neutral state .",
    "these scenarios , formulated within a quantum theory of energetics ( dft ) but a one - electron picture of the spectrum , contrast strikingly with the deep donor possibility posed by pck .",
    "most of the existing studies confine their focus to energetics of the h - in - ge system and on `` energy level '' positions , without an exposition of the spectral distribution of the h @xmath0 weight .",
    "while the h impurity in an elemental semiconductor is the most primitive realization of the impurity problem , this type of system has not seen a material - specific treatment of the dynamical correlations that will influence its electronic structure and excitation spectrum . in this paper",
    "we provide results of a dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) treatment@xcite that sheds light on several of the primary issues .",
    "interstitial h in intrinsic ge presents a seemingly simple system : a single half - filled @xmath0 orbital hybridized with a semiconducting bath . a neutral h impurity ( our interest here ) adds one electron that is expected to be accommodated in an additional `` state '' within the gap or the valence band and most likely the latter , since there has been no signature of an electrically and magnetically active gap state .    anticipating the disturbance ( in density , in screened potential ) in an insulator to be localized , we adopt a supercell representation of the impurity .",
    "we consider a single interstitial hydrogen atom in the tetrahedrally - symmetric antibonding position in ge , both in a single ( periodic ) conventional cubic diamond - structure supercell ( containing 8 ge atoms , denoted hge@xmath4 ) and in a @xmath5 supercell of conventional cells ( containing 64 ge atoms and denoted hge@xmath6 ) .",
    "choosing two different supercell sizes allows us to further study the influence of effective h - ge hybridization beyond simply reducing the hopping matrix elements and tests to what degree the influence of the h impurity is spatially localized .",
    "there is vibrational evidence@xcite that h sits off the tetrahedral site along a @xmath7 $ ] direction , thus closer to one of the four ge ions than the others , giving it only one ge nearest neighbor .",
    "we do not treat that possibility here , though the methods we use can be applied to that case .",
    "due to a number of uncertainties about materials parameters ( and the local density approximation [ lda ] gap problem due to the small gap of ge ) , we vary the parameters that are not well established , with the goal of obtaining a more general picture of the behavior of a `` h - like '' interstitial in an elemental tetrahedral semiconductor .",
    "one challenge is to deal with the gap underestimation in lda . in ge ,",
    "the lda gap is slightly negative , in contrast to the observed gap of 0.8 ev .",
    "since our objective is an initial investigation of dynamical correlations at the h site , we adopt the simplest representation of the ge electronic structure . semiconducting ge",
    "will be modeled here using an empirical nearest - neighbor slater - koster ( s - k ) tight - binding model ( etb ) consisting of four wannier orbitals ( one @xmath8 and three @xmath9 orbitals ) per ge with parameters obtained from the work of newman and dow.@xcite the h - ge hopping parameters are taken from the work of pandey.@xcite      there are , inevitably for the current stage of dmft theory , two parameters that are not known _ a priori _ : the coulomb interaction @xmath2 and the bare on - site @xmath0 energy @xmath3 with respect to the ge band gap . for the single orbital problem",
    "there is no hund s rule @xmath10 interaction to be concerned about , nor multiplet effects .",
    "in fact , for the isolated h interstitial the dmft result is exact to within numerical uncertainties . while h - ge hybridization amplitudes could be extracted from first - principles dft calculations , since the gap problem in lda leads us to use an etb model of the ge electronic structure , we use etb hopping amplitudes that were derived in the same spirit .",
    "the hydrogen on - site energy @xmath3 is varied as part of this investigation , guided somewhat by the lda calculations reported in sec .",
    "iii . within lda , where there are no parameters , the @xmath0 spectral density for h in the tetrahedral site unexpectedly bifurcates ,",
    "so there is no clear point of reference for fixing @xmath3 .",
    "this splitting is a result of the rather strong hybridization of the @xmath0 orbital with the @xmath1 antibonding orbitals of the four surrounding ge atoms .",
    "lda includes , for a localized state such as a weakly hybridized @xmath0 orbital , a spurious self - interaction that raises the lda site energy above what is presumed in a lda+dmft calculation , providing an extra challenge for determining @xmath3 .",
    "the h @xmath0 orbital likely is not a really strongly localized state in ge , but we expect that @xmath3 = -4 ev should be regarded as upper bound of the bare @xmath0 level .",
    "we use the two values -5 ev and -8 ev to span the reasonable range of this parameter . with regard to the onsite energy",
    ", we use the bottom of the gap as the zero of energy throughout this paper .    the bare ( _ i.e. _ unscreened ) on - site repulsion @xmath11 for an isolated h @xmath0 orbital is @xmath12 ry = 17.01 ev .",
    "this is perhaps surprisingly small for what might seem to be a very small orbital : the @xmath0 orbital of the smallest atom .",
    "however , it becomes reasonable once it is recognized that the @xmath0 radial density @xmath13 peaks at 1 @xmath14 , whereas the comparable quantity in @xmath15 cations peaks at 0.6 - 0.9 @xmath14 and has @xmath16 25 - 30 ev .",
    "screening at a large interstitial site in a small gap insulator is hard to estimate , with no comparable values in the literature .",
    "we investigate screened values @xmath2=7 ev and @xmath2=12 ev to span the likely range .",
    "@xmath17 ev is not much smaller than the unscreened , isolated h value and should allow the examination of the strong interaction regime .",
    "the choice of 7 ev has specific interest : pck argued@xcite that a lone h @xmath0 state would have a bare correlation energy on the order of 1 ry ( our analytic value is actually 17 ev ) , and that reduction by screening in an insulator would leave a substantial interaction strength of 67 ev .",
    "this amount of reduction , and more , has over the intervening years become commonplace in understanding the effective values of @xmath2 in transition metal oxides .",
    "although we vary both parameters in our impurity hamiltonian ( see sec .  [",
    "subsec : tb ] ) , as well as the h ",
    "ge hybridization , it is still beneficial to understand the physical value of the interactions in order to both analyze the validity of our range of considered @xmath2 and of the predictions of pck and to motivate and guide future material - specific studies .",
    "we do this by employing the constrained random - phase approximation ( crpa),@xcite performed within the full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( flapw ) method using maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs).@xcite we use the flapw method as implemented in the ` fleur ` code@xcite with the pbe exchange - correlation potential@xcite for the ground - state calculations .",
    "mlwfs are constructed with the ` wannier90 ` code .",
    "@xcite the effective coulomb potential is calculated within the recently developed crpa method implemented in the ` spex ` code @xcite ( for further technical details see refs . , , and ) .",
    "we use a grid of @xmath18 k - points in our hge@xmath4 crpa calculations .",
    "the crpa consists of first writing the polarizability    @xmath19,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the dft wave functions and their eigenvalues , and @xmath22 runs over both spin channels . if one separates @xmath23 into @xmath24 , containing the correlated orbitals , and @xmath25 , containing the rest , and if one considers the unscreened coulomb operator @xmath26 , one can write@xcite @xmath27^{-1}v\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matrix elements of the effective coulomb potential @xmath2 in the mlwf basis are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mlwf at site @xmath30 with orbital index @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "is calculated within the crpa .    in our calculations ,",
    "we choose the ge @xmath33 and the h @xmath0 orbitals as our correlated subspace .",
    "this is motivated by several considerations .",
    "first , we note that , although only the h @xmath0 orbital is treated within dmft , an interacting picture of the ge orbitals ( taking into account not only the hubbard model interactions considered here but other more general and perhaps non - local terms ) is necessary to give the correct gapped band structure . in our dmft calculations , this is accomplished through the etb hamiltonian , but here it is necessary to exclude the screening from the ge @xmath34 orbitals in order to get the most accurate assessment of the screened interactions on the h orbital .",
    "the lda electronic structure ( fig .  [ fig : lda ] ) in section  [ ssec : lda ] makes clear another reason for the necessity of treating the entire ge @xmath34 + h @xmath8 subspace within the crpa : the h 1@xmath8 state is thoroughly entangled in the ge 4@xmath8 and 4@xmath9 background .",
    "in fact , it appears to be split across two bands , frustrating attempts to isolate and manipulate it . naturally , excluding the ge @xmath34 screening increases the resulting value of the h 1@xmath8 hubbard @xmath2 , which can be considered as an upper limit , and so the value of @xmath2 most appropriate for our hge@xmath4 dmft calculations ( in which we only treat the dynamical correlations on the h 1@xmath8 orbital ) is likely smaller than the 11.2 ev we report in table  [ tab : crpa ] .",
    "due to the difference in correlated subspaces considered and the many varied parameters in the dmft treatment , it is most appropriate to view this crpa analysis as a separate method for understanding the h impurities and as a way to check the reasonableness of our dmft approach .",
    "we note that the bare ( unscreened ) value @xmath35 = 16.9 ev is satisfyingly close to the analytic result for @xmath11 for an isolated h atom ( 5/4 ry = 17.01 ev ) , reflecting the accuracy of the codes .",
    ".crpa parameters screened hubbard @xmath2 and hund s rule @xmath36 ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and 1 for _ s _ and _ p _ orbitals , respectively ) calculated for h @xmath0 and ge @xmath40 orbitals in hge@xmath4 , when all @xmath34 transitions were excluded . when all transitions are excluded we obtain the bare ( unscreened ) value @xmath35 and @xmath41 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      increasing the interaction strength to @xmath2 = 12 ev , which is near the crpa value , prompts some further spreading of the spectral weight and additional sharpening ( but also shrinking ) of the spectral peak in the gap region as the upper hubbard - like band is pushed well clear . the five - peak structure that emerges in hge@xmath4",
    "can be understood by the splitting of the upper and lower hubbard bands due to h - ge hybridization ( leading to much reduced or absent splitting in the low - hopping case ) .",
    "the @xmath0 orbital tends toward half - filling for all parameter values reflecting the strong coupling limit .",
    "qualitatively the 1@xmath8 spectrum in hge@xmath4 is not affected greatly by the near - doubling of the interaction strength . however , in section  [ ssec : lm ] , we find that @xmath43 reaches its maximum value at or near @xmath2 = 12 ev at all values of @xmath3 and the h - ge hybridization that we consider .",
    "the h @xmath0 spectrum of hge@xmath6 begins to differ more strongly from that of the smaller cell when the interaction becomes strong .",
    "a gap that roughly corresponds to the ge gap but does not necessarily fall across @xmath44 is restored for both values of the h energy level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : u12 ] ) .",
    "further , the sharp peak now just above the gap begins to dissipate , only just surviving in the @xmath45 ev spectra at full hopping , while nearly disappearing for reduced hopping in the @xmath46 spectra .",
    "this behavior suggests that a mott - hubbard insulating character of the @xmath0 spectrum should arise as the impurity limit is approached or as the interaction continues to increase .",
    "ev ) , the low - energy quasiparticle - like peak diminishes with respect to the states centered at @xmath3 and in the conduction band .",
    "this effect is most dramatic in the 64-ge cell , where the spectral weight in the dominant peak at @xmath47 is almost completely transferred to higher energy opening or nearly opening a clear gap . in all cases ,",

    "reduction in h - ge hybridization results , as expected , in greater spin - polarization in the impurity orbital , but the effect becomes pronounced for reduction below 75% hopping amplitude where the dependence on @xmath3 also becomes strong . ]      transitions to a magnetic local moment state @xmath52 @xmath53(1 ) occur at different interactions strengths for different values of @xmath3 and h ",
    "ge hopping . to shed further light on this transition , we performed a more detailed set of calculations .",
    "we varied @xmath2 between 4 and 12 ev , @xmath3 between -5 and -8 ev , and the h - ge hopping between 50% and 100% of the etb value , with all calculations performed in the hge@xmath4 cell .",
    "the results are summarized in figure  [ fig : moment ] .    at low @xmath2 ,",
    "the the local moment at @xmath51 hopping ( dotted curve in figure  [ fig : moment ] ) can be much smaller than when hybridization is larger .",
    "table  [ tab : small_summary ] shows that this is due to the large occupation of the h orbital , particularly when @xmath3 is below -5 ev .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , the dashed and dotted curves ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 hopping , respectively ) , show much larger moments , with @xmath43 in excess of 0.9 in the h orbital at @xmath51 hopping .",
    "this behavior can be understood both as a direct result of the hybridization and the increase in interaction strength .",
    "the behavior of the curves at @xmath42 ev shows that the largest @xmath2 we considered in the main body of our dmft study is sufficient to saturate the local moment : a fortuitous coincidence . within each set of curves",
    ", it can be observed that , until relatively large @xmath2 , the local moment increases with decreasing h level depth . both this trend and its trend toward reversal at very large @xmath2 arise from the orbital s proximity to half - filling .",
    "clearly an orbital at half - filling is able to support a larger moment than one well away from half filling .",
    "below @xmath54 ev , only the shallower states are able to push their upper `` hubbard bands '' above the gap . at large @xmath2 , on the other hand",
    ", the orbital approaches half - filling regardless of @xmath3 , although for the shallowest @xmath0 level , filling falls below unity accompanied by a smaller moment .",
    "this tendency to form moments at low effective hybridization and large @xmath2 is consistent with the infinite-@xmath2 , hge@xmath55 mean - field treatment of pck , and with lore accumulated in the interim .",
    "in addition , this behavior bears some resemblance to that predicted by li _ _ et al.__@xcite for impurities on graphene , where there is a vanishing gap and the environment is two- rather than three - dimensional .",
    "we have employed dynamical mean field theory using the ct - hyb solver to study the electronic structure of one of the simplest , but still important conceptually and possibly technologically , impurity systems : an interstitial h - like impurity in the antibonding interstitial site in a diamond - structure covalent semiconductor representative of ge .",
    "the non - degenerate @xmath0 orbital precludes any necessity of considering hund s rule magnetic couping or multiplet effects , so dmft is the exact solution to the impurity problem in the limit of large supercell . because ge within lda has no gap ,",
    "the non - interacting system was represented by an empirical tight - binding model with parameters based on previous h - ge studies .",
    "the h @xmath0 spectrum shows a rich but systematic behavior as the on - site interaction parameter @xmath2 , the h - ge hopping amplitude @xmath56 , and the h on - site energy @xmath3 are varied , with some parameter ranges possibly giving some insight into si or diamond hosts as well as ge .",
    "the dependence on temperature was studied but found to be minor , and therefore has not been presented .",
    "our results demonstrate that electron - electron correlations can play a role in determining the properties of the isolated h impurity in such a system . if @xmath57 , which naively puts the upper `` hubbard band '' above the gap , the on - site coulomb repulsion is sufficient to prevent the h orbital from acquiring electrons from the surrounding ge as is the case within lda .",
    "the behavior of this system is enriched by the bifurcation , at the lda level , of the @xmath0 spectrum , with much of the weight in and just below the gap and the rest around 4 - 5 ev binding energy . within the extended tight - binding model we use and with @xmath2=0 , which is not exactly the same as within lda but",
    "is closely related , the @xmath0 occupation is 1.7 - 1.8 reflecting acceptor character ( hole - doping ) of ge before the interaction is turned on .",
    "the distributed spectrum primarily through the valence region may be interpreted as the hyper - deep donor character that was envisioned by pck .",
    "increasing @xmath2 and/or reducing the hybridization moves the @xmath0 occupation toward unity  anderson impurity character  with the rate of approach affected by the choice of the bare @xmath0 site energy @xmath3 .    to contribute to a more specific study of h in ge ,",
    "we have computed the interaction parameters @xmath2 and @xmath36 in hge@xmath4 for the ge @xmath34 and h @xmath8 orbitals within the constrained rpa formalism .",
    "the h 1@xmath8 hubbard @xmath2 is , as expected , much larger than those associated with the ge 4@xmath8 or 4@xmath9 states , and is coincidentally similar to the largest interaction parameter we considered in our dmft approach .",
    "further studies are necessary to pin down the behavior of a real h atom in ge , which will involve optimization of the energy versus h position together with relaxation of the ge positions . in si ,",
    "for example , h more commonly assumes a bond - center position although the tetrahedral interstitial is not far above in energy.@xcite the methods needed for those calculations require accurate total energy capability with charge self - consistency , and must include the weak correlation within the ge @xmath34 bands that gets the band gap correct as well as the potentially moderately strong correlation associated with the h impurity . as such",
