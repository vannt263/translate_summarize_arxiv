    "randomized load balancing , where a job is assigned to a server from a small subset of randomly chosen servers , is very simple to implement , and can surprisingly deliver better performance ( for example reducing collisions , waiting times , backlogs ) in a number of applications , such as , data center , hash tables , distributed memory machines , path selection in networks , and task assignment at web servers .",
    "one useful model that has been extensively used to study the randomized load balancing schemes is the supermarket model . in the supermarket model ,",
    "a key result by vvedenskaya , dobrushin and karpelevich @xcite indicated that when each poisson arriving job is assigned to the shortest one of @xmath0 randomly chosen queues with exponential service times , the equilibrium queue length can decay doubly exponentially in the limit as the population number @xmath1 , and the stationary fraction of queues with at least @xmath2 customers is @xmath3 , which is a substantially exponential improvement over the case for @xmath4 , where the tail of stationary queue length distribution in the corresponding m / m/1 queue is @xmath5 .",
    "the distributed load balancing strategies , in which individual job decisions are based on information on a limited number of other processors , have been studied analytically by eager , lazokwska and zahorjan @xcite and through trace - driven simulations by zhou @xcite .",
    "based on this , the supermarket model is developed by queueing theory and markov processes .",
    "most of recent research applied the density dependent jump markov processes to deal with a simple supermarket model with poisson arrival processes and exponential service times , a key result of which illustrates that there exists a unique fixed point which is decreasing doubly exponentially .",
    "that approach used in the literature relies on determining the behavior of the supermarket model as its size grows to infinity , and its behavior is naturally described as a system of differential equations , which leads to a closed form solution : doubly exponential structure , of the fixed point .",
    "readers may refer to , such as , analyzing a basic and simple supermarket model by azar , broder , karlin and upfal @xcite , vvedenskaya , dobrushin and karpelevich @xcite , mitzenmacher @xcite .",
    "certain generalization of the supermarket model have been explored , for example , simple variations by mitzenmacher and vcking @xcite , mitzenmacher @xcite , vcking @xcite , mitzenmacher , richa , and sitaraman @xcite and vvedenskaya and suhov @xcite ; and analyzing load information by mirchandaney , towsley , and stankovic @xcite , dahlin @xcite , mitzenmacher @xcite .",
    "furthermore , martin and suhov @xcite , martin @xcite , suhov and vvedenskaya @xcite studied the supermarket mall model by means of the fast jackson network , where each node in a jackson network is replaced by @xmath6 parallel servers , and a job joins the shortest of @xmath7 randomly chosen queues at the node to which it is directed .",
    "luczak and mcdiamid @xcite studied the maximum queue length of the original supermarket model with exponential service times when the service speed scales linearly with the number of jobs in the queue .",
    "li , lui and wang @xcite discussed the supermarket model with ph service times and the supermarket model with markovian arrival processes , respectively .",
    "readers may refer to an excellent overview by mitzenmacher , richa , and sitaraman @xcite .",
    "this paper is interested in analyzing the supermarket model with general service times , which is an open problem for determining whether or how the heavy - tailed service times can disrupt the doubly exponential structure of the fixed point . on the other hand , note",
    "that the supermarket model is a complex queueing system and has much different characteristics from the ordinary queueing systems , thus the general service times make its analysis more challenging than the exponential or ph service case . up to now",
    ", there has not been an effective method to be able to deal with the supermarket model with general service times .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are threefold . the first one is to provide a novel and simple approach to study the supermarket model with general service times .",
    "this approach is based on the supplementary variable method but is described as a new integral - differential structure for expressing and computing the fraction of queues efficiently . using the new approach ,",
    "we setup an infinite - size system of integral - differential equations , which makes applications of the density dependent jump markov processes to be able to deal with the general distributions , such as general service times , involved in the supermarket model .",
    "the second one is to obtain a close - form solution : doubly exponential structure , for the fixed point satisfying the system of nonlinear equations , which is always a key in the study of supermarket models .",
    "furthermore , this paper analyzes the exponential convergence of the current location of the supermarket model to its fixed point , and studies the lipschitz condition in the kurtz theorem under general service times .",
    "also , this paper provides numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in analyzing the randomized load balancing schemes with the non - exponential service requirements .",
    "the third one is to obtain that the fixed point is decomposited into two groups of information under a product form : the arrival information and the service information .",
    "based on this , we indicate three important observations :    ( a ) : :    the fixed point for the supermarket model is different from the tail    of stationary queue length distribution for the ordinary m / g/1 queue ,    because the fixed point is light - tailed but the stationary queue    length is heavy - tail if the service times are heavy - tailed .",
    "note that    such a difference is illustrated in this paper for the first time ,    while it can not be observed in the literature for the supermarket    model with poisson arrivals and exponential service times , e.g. , see    mitzenmacher , richa , and sitaraman @xcite .",
    "( b ) : :    the doubly exponential solution to the fixed point can extensively    exist even if the service time distribution is heavy - tailed .",
    "this is    an answer of the above open problem to illustrate the role played by    the heavy - tailed service time distribution in the doubly exponential    solution to the fixed point .",
    "( c ) : :    the doubly exponential solution to the fixed point is not unique for a    more general supermarket model .",
    "note that we give three different    doubly exponential solutions in the supermarket model with poisson    arrivals and ph service times , thus it is very interesting to provide    all the doubly exponential solutions for a more general supermarket    model .",
    "based on this , one can gain the new and important understanding how the workload probing can help in load balancing jobs with general service times such as heavy - tailed service .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we first describe a supermarket model with general service times , which is always useful in the study of randomized load balancing schemes . then the supermarket model is expressed as a systems of integral - differential equations in terms of the density dependent jump markov processes . in section 3 ,",
    "we first introduce a fixed point of the system of integral - differential equations , and set up a system of nonlinear equations satisfied by the fixed point .",
    "then we provide a close - form solution : doubly exponential structure , to the system of nonlinear equations . in section 4",
    ", we provide a necessary discussion on the key parameter @xmath8 used in the doubly exponential structure , and indicate that the doubly exponential solution to the fixed point extensively exists even if the service time distribution is heavy - tailed . in section 5 ,",
    "we give three methods to analyze the supermarket model with poisson arrivals and ph service times , and provide three different ways to determine the key parameter @xmath8 and compute the doubly exponential solution to the fixed point .",
    "we show that the doubly exponential solution to the fixed point is not unique for a more general supermarket . in section 6 ,",
    "we study the exponential convergence of the current location of the supermarket model to its fixed point .",
    "not only does the exponential convergence indicates the existence of the fixed point , but it also explains such a convergent process is very fast . in section 7 , we apply the kurtz theorem to study the supermarket model with the general service times , and analyze the lipschitz condition with respect to general service times .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section 8 .",
    "in this section , we first describe a supermarket model with general service times .",
    "then we provide a novel and simple approach to setup an infinite - size system of integral - differential equations based on the density dependent jump markov processes .",
    "note that this approach is based on the supplementary variable method but is described as a new integral - differential structure so that the corresponding boundary conditions are written in a different version .",
    "let us formally describe the supermarket model , which is abstracted as a multi - server multi - queue stochastic system .",
    "customers arrive at a queueing system of @xmath9 servers as a poisson process with an average arrival rate @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "the service time @xmath12 of the @xmath2th customer is general with the distribution function@xmath13 where all the random variables @xmath12 for @xmath14 are i.i.d . with the mean @xmath15   = 1/\\mu$ ] .",
    "each arriving customer chooses @xmath16 servers independently and uniformly at random from these @xmath17 servers , and waits for service at the server which currently contains the fewest number of customers .",
    "if there is a tie , servers with the fewest number of customers will be chosen randomly .",
    "all customers in any service center will be served in the first - come - first - served ( fcfs ) manner .",
    "figure 1 simply shows such a supermarket model .        in the study of supermarket models ,",
    "it is necessary for us to study general service time distributions , for example , heavy - tailed distributions . not only because the general distribution makes analysis of the supermarket models more difficult and challenging than those in the literature for the exponential or ph service case , but it also allows us to model more realistic systems and understand their performance implication under the randomized load balancing strategy . as indicated in @xcite , the process times of many parallel jobs , in particular ,",
    "jobs to data centers , tend to be non - exponential . unless we state otherwise",
    ", we assume that all the random variables defined above are independent , and that the system is operating under the condition : @xmath18 .",
    "the supermarket model with general service times is stable if @xmath19    * proof : * let @xmath20 and @xmath21 be the queue lengths of the ordinary m / g/1 queue and of an arbitrary server in the supermarket model at time @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "note that in the supermarket model , each customer chooses @xmath7 servers independently and uniformily at random , and the queue length of the entering server is currently shorten , it is easy to see that for each @xmath23,@xmath24 since the ordinary m / g/1 queue is stable if @xmath18 , it follows from ( [ equ0 ] ) that the supermarket model with general service times is stable if @xmath18 .",
    "this completes the proof .    ' '' ''    for @xmath14 , we define @xmath25d@xmath26 as the number of queues with at least @xmath2 customers and the residual service time of each server be in the interval @xmath27d@xmath28 at time @xmath23 . clearly , @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "now , we setup a system of integral - differential equations by means of the density dependent jump markov process . to that end , we provide an example with @xmath48 to indicate how to derive the system of integral - differential equations .",
