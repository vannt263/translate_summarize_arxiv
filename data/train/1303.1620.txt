    "one of the most important discoveries of the modern cosmology is the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "this phenomenon was first discovered by the type ia supernovae observations @xcite , and later further confirmed by the measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) @xcite and so on .",
    "now more than ten years later , this phenomenon has been accepted widely . as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the question concerning",
    "this is no longer whether the universe is accelerating , but why .    in order to give a reasonable explanation to this scenario ,",
    "a great variety of attempts have been done .",
    "these works include the dark energy models which involve the introduction of exotic matter sources , and the modified gravity models which relates to the changes of the geometry of the spacetime @xcite .",
    "although these models can solve some problems and fit the observational data , they also have their own difficulties .",
    "for example , the standard @xmath4cdm model is considered to be the simplest and most natural one which shows great consistence with the observational data@xcite . in this model , the cosmological constant @xmath4 is considered to be the dark energy component of the universe .",
    "however , it is also challenged by the fine - tuning problem and the coincidence problem .",
    "so the study of explaining the accelerated expansion is still continued and the new models are being proposed @xcite .    for obtaining more information of the evolutionary behavior of the universe , one can study the time derivative of the scale factor @xmath0 with respect to the redshift @xmath3 in the frame of a frw universe , such as the hubble parameter @xmath7 , the deceleration factor @xmath8 and so on . as a direct indication of the decelerated / accelerated expansion ,",
    "the parameter @xmath9 has been studied from both the observational and theoretical views , including the constraints from the observational data , the analysis of a particular model , or the reconstruction by some statistical methods such as the principle component approach ( pca ) and so on @xcite . as a higher order derivative of the scale factor ,",
    "the jerk parameter @xmath10 is related to the third time derivative of @xmath11 ( we notice that in some earlier works , there is no negative sign in the definition as ref.@xcite and so forth .",
    "however , some literatures contain the negative sign as ref.@xcite .",
    "we point out the difference here in order to avoid the confusion ) .",
    "it is a measurement of the variation of @xmath9 and can be used as an indication to predict the future of the universe .",
    "because the higher - order derivatives can characterize the dynamics of the universe , it could be related to the emergence of sudden future singularities @xcite .",
    "another example is the @xmath4cdm cosmology where @xmath12 implies that the universe will continue to expand with an acceleration because of the cosmological constant . except",
    "that , the jerk parameter @xmath1 is also applied in the statefinder diagnostic to discriminate different dark energy or modified gravity models @xcite . although the single @xmath1 can not identify some similar models as @xmath4cdm and einstein de - sitter universe ,",
    "its combination with @xmath9 can comprise an identification in a wider range of cosmological models . compared with the plentiful research works of @xmath9 ,",
    "the jerk parameter has not been fully explored at present @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to study the jerk parameter because of its importance in cosmology .    among the numerous cosmological models ,",
    "the standard @xmath4cdm model can fit most of the observations and is considered as the best one@xcite .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to set the @xmath4cdm model as the fiducial model and thus @xmath13 is an important reference . in our calculation , we will mainly measure the departure of @xmath1 from -1 by its parameterizations .",
    "this will be a direct generalization of the standard @xmath4cdm model .",
    "specifically , we will reconstruct jerk as @xmath14 and measure the departure term with the observational data .",
    "the results can give us the impression if the universe in the past was strictly the standard model or not .    in our work ,",
    "the constraints on @xmath1 are presented by the use of the latest union 2.1 supernovae data ( sne ) @xcite and the observational hubble parameter data ( ohd ) @xcite . as the two widely used measurements at low redshift , sne and ohd have been applied in dozens of cosmological",
    "researches @xcite .",
    "the comparisons between them were also discussed deeply and widely @xcite .",
    "therefore , we also compare the powers of sne and ohd in constraining the models of jerk parameterizations and analyze the differences between them .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ basic ] , the basic formulas of the kinematical models and the reconstruction of jerk parameter are presented . in sec.[constraint ] , the constraints by use of sne and ohd data sample are obtained and analyzed . our discussions and conclusions are given in sec.[conclusion ] .",
    "let s start with the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric which describes a homogenous and isotropic universe @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the spatial curvature and for simplicity , we hereafter will assume it to be zero , namely , our calculation will be carried out in a spatial flat frw universe @xcite .",
    "and the function @xmath0 is the scale factor and its current value is always set to be unity , therefore the time recording of the history of the universe can be represented by the redshift @xmath3 with the relation @xmath17 .",
    "as mentioned in the preceding section , the time derivatives of @xmath11 are defined as @xmath18 @xmath19'}{h(z)^{2}}-1,\\ ] ] @xmath20''}{h(z)^{2}}-(1+z)\\frac{[h(z)^{2}]'}{h(z)^{2}}+1\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the redshift @xmath3 .    within the assumption of a constant @xmath2 , eq.([eq :",
    "jerk ] ) is an euler equation solved as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are arbitrary constants and @xmath24 the solution gives a constraint that @xmath25 . with the redefinition of @xmath26 , where the subscript 0 stands for the current value of a quantity , the expansion factor of the frw cosmology can be written as @xmath27 then using the definition of the expansion factor @xmath28",
    ", we can substitute @xmath29 into eq.([eq : jerk ] ) and replace @xmath30 without any essential change .    in order to determine the constants appeared in eq.([eq : e ] ) and their physical meanings in the solution",
    ", we can apply a particular cosmological model as a reference . in the @xmath4cdm model",
    ", we have @xmath13 and eq.([eq : e ] ) becomes @xmath31 it is clear that @xmath32 becomes the matter term @xmath33 ( including the ordinary matter and the dark matter ) and @xmath34 represents the cosmological constant term @xmath35 .",
    "however , we should notice that this correspondence is just valid in the frame of the @xmath4cdm model .",
    "we can not say for sure the explicit relationship between @xmath32 , @xmath34 and @xmath33 , @xmath35 , but the approximation of @xmath4cdm model is a proper reference for us to find the real meaning of the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath34 .",
    "additionally , the current value of eq.([eq : e ] ) gives @xmath36 the assumption of @xmath37 leads eq.([eq : jerk ] ) to a homogeneous euler equation which can be seen more obviously under the variable substitutions : @xmath38 this result provides us the possibility to test the deviation of @xmath2 from -1 or other value in the past , but the calculation is dependent on the functional form of @xmath2 .",
    "similarly as the methods studying the properties of the interaction between dark energy and dark matter by assuming some phenomenological models @xcite , one possible proposal in reconstructing jerk is @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are constants needed to be constrained while @xmath42 is an arbitrary function of redshift @xmath3 , the different choices of which can lead to different reconstructions of @xmath2.this kind of assumption has several advantages .",
    "firstly , it can make eq.([eq : jerk ] ) analytically solvable under particular models of @xmath42 .",
    "secondly , it can also make eq.([eq : jerk ] ) more symmetric by satisfying both sides of the equation comprised by a constant term plus a @xmath43 term .",
    "the simplest form of @xmath42 is perhaps the linear form which can be written as @xmath44 , which is the first order of the linear expansion of @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , inspired by reconstructing the equation of state ( eos ) of the dark energy , we propose another model similarly as the cpl parameterizations @xcite @xmath45 to be more general , we can also apply some functions which are different from the above . we choose the similar jbp @xcite ( in reconstructing the eos of dark energy ) and the logarithmic model . to sum up",
    ", we apply four models of @xmath42 in our calculation . moreover , as mentioned in the previous section , we regard the standard @xmath4cdm model as the fiducial model and reconstruct @xmath2 aiming at measuring the departure of @xmath1 from -1 .",
    "therefore @xmath40 in eq.([eq : re_j ] ) can be set to -1 and the second term can be seen as the perturbation .",
    "this thought is similar with the previous work @xcite , but the specific method is different .",
    "the authors there adopted the chebyshev polynomials in reconstructing @xmath2 and presented a detailed analysis . in our calculation , we just parameterize the @xmath2 phenomenologically and make the euler equation solvable . once the above reconstructing methods are introduced , we can summarize the four parameterizations as @xmath46 one point worth noticing is that all these models have @xmath47 .",
    "more discussions of this issue will be given in the following section .",
    "substituting these equations into eq.([eq : jerk ] ) , we can obtain the solutions of @xmath29    @xmath48    the coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath34 arise from the process of solving eq.([eq : jerk ] ) which is a second order differential equation .",
    "another constraint that @xmath49 gives a relationship between the constants @xmath32 , @xmath34 and @xmath41 @xmath50 thus each model above has two free parameters ( @xmath51 ) needed to be constrained by the observational data .",
    "the first observational data sample used in our calculation is the measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "this kind of observation plays an important role in discovering the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "its application in constraining the cosmological models comes from the distance modulus which is defined as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the luminosity distance . in a spatially flat frw universe",
    ", the luminosity distance of a cosmological source at redshift @xmath3 reads as @xmath54 the parameters introduced in the model can be obtained through the @xmath55 statistics . in our calculations , we choose the marginalized nuisance parameter @xcite for @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57^{2}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}},\\ ] ] @xmath58}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}},\\ ] ] @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the @xmath61 uncertainty of the @xmath62th measurement .",
    "the subscripts `` obs '' and `` th '' stand for the observational and theoretical values of a variable respectively . in our work , we choose the latest union2.1 compilation of the sne data sample @xcite which contains 580 type ia supernovae observations in the redshift range @xmath63 . on the other hand , the systematic errors in measuring the luminosity distance should also be considered .",
    "thus we calculate the constraints of union2.1 with systematic errors of the jerk parameterizations as well .",
    "the method we used here is the same as suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "we also adopt the observational hubble parameter data ( ohd ) in our constraints .",
    "it is known that the sne is powerful in constraining the cosmological models .",
    "however , the integration in its formula makes it hard to reflect the precise evolution of @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the fine structure of the expansion history of the universe can be well indicated by the @xmath30 data . the measurement of ohd can be derived from the differential of redshift @xmath3 with respect to the cosmic time @xmath64 @xmath65 in this work , we use the 21 @xmath30 measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite to constrain the jerk models .",
    "the @xmath55 value for the ohd can be expressed as @xmath66^{2}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}.\\ ] ] the best - fit values of the parameters can be obtained by minimizing the above quantity .",
    "it should be noticed that there is a nuisance parameter in the ohd constraint : @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , we marginalize it by using a prior @xmath68 km s@xmath69 mpc@xmath69 @xcite which contains a 2.8% systematic uncertainty . on the other hand ,",
    "the prior value of @xmath70 km s@xmath69 mpc@xmath69 was also used in the previous works and showed efficient constraints on the cosmological models@xcite . except that , this value is more consistent with the newly released planck results@xcite .",
    "so we also use this prior in our calculation and the results may provide valuable comparisons .    additionally , as the newly measurement at @xmath5 from the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) in the ly@xmath71 is discovered @xcite , we also adopt this data in our calculation in order to find the effect of this addition in constraining cosmological models . for convenience",
    ", we will use the term `` @xmath72 '' in the following sections to denote this measurement .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we study the property of the cosmological jerk parameter in detail . just within the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic universe without any introduction of the underlying gravitational theory and energy components , we propose several various kinds of reconstruction of jerk parameter and perform a kinematic analysis and constraint by the sne and ohd samples .",
    "our constraining results show that the standard @xmath4cdm model can be well accommodated by the sne and ohd observations .",
    "in other words , the @xmath4cdm model can be well supported by the evolution of the scale factor up to its third time derivative .",
    "especially , the constraint of sne data gives a nearly zero value of the parameter @xmath41 which is a measurement of the deviation of @xmath2 from the @xmath4cdm model .",
    "once the constraint uncertainties are taken into account , the ohd can give similar results .",
    "this is consistent with the previous studies that ohd can play the same role as sne in constraining cosmological models .    as pointed out in sec.[sec : re_j ] , the parameterizations of jerk in our work have @xmath13 at @xmath73 . although the previous works did not show the current universe is strictly the @xmath4cdm one@xcite , the concordance @xmath4cdm paradigm is also strongly supported @xcite .",
    "moreover , the real value of @xmath1 at @xmath73 should be directly obtained by the current or at least , the low - redshift observations .",
    "however , the low - redshift research is far from comprehensive or efficient enough .",
    "for example , the equation of state of the dark energy is allowable and theoretically possible to have arbitrarily large fluctuations at ultra - low redshifts @xcite .",
    "this may increase the uncertainties of the measurements at low redshift . and thus the study of the low redshift cosmology is necessary and of great importance .",
    "except that , there also appears to be some tension between low @xmath3 and high @xmath3 data @xcite .",
    "these facts make the confirmation of the current value of @xmath1 difficult .",
    "thus compared with this potential uncertainty , one possible way is to adopt the simplest model , the @xmath4cdm model and ignore the chaotic knowledge .    in order to obtain more information of our reconstruction , we also calculated the hubble parameter @xmath30 , equation of state @xmath74 , deceleration factor @xmath75 and @xmath6 diagnostic of the jerk models .",
    "the effect of the addition of h@xmath76 is significant in the @xmath55 constraint which can be seen from fig.[fig : recon_h ] .",
    "also , the equation of state @xmath77 in the redshift range @xmath78 shows a phantom - like universe but the evidence is not strong .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath75 indicate a current accelerated expansion phase following a matter - dominated phase .",
    "this is consistent with the great discovery of type ia sne @xcite .",
    "moreover , we employ the @xmath6 diagnostic in our calculation .",
    "this kind of function can not only behave as a diagnostic to distinguish different dark energy models from @xmath4cdm model .",
    "moreover , we conjecture that it is also useful in studying the kinematic models .",
    "because this kind of models is often obtained mathematically rather than physically , the meanings of the parameters rising from the solution process are hard to handle . from this point of view",
    ", @xmath79 can be used as a `` matter generator '' or the `` effective '' matter term in this kind of cosmological models .",
    "our results show that ohd prefers a smaller value of @xmath79 at @xmath73 . additionally , the change of @xmath6 in the past was not significant .",
    "in other words , @xmath6 evolves like a constant .",
    "this can be seen as a positive proof of regarding the @xmath41 term in the @xmath2 parameterizations as a perturbation .    in this work ,",
    "we use two kinds of observational data : type ia supernovae and hubble parameter .",
    "the comparisons between them in constraining cosmological models have been studied for several years .",
    "because of the large size of the data sample and relatively clear systematic errors , sne always provides more efficient constraint than ohd .",
    "however , when the systematic errors of the measurements are taken into account , the constraints from sne become worse than ohd and this can be seen in our jerk results . moreover , the latest development in the measurement of hubble parameter gives us the possibility that the data sample with smaller size also has the power to constrain dark energy models effectively even better than sne @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is anticipated that the future high - z , high - accuracy @xmath30 determinations will provide more important contributions in cosmological researches @xcite .    in our analysis ,",
    "the joint constraints are also achieved . as expected",
    ", the joint constraints can sufficiently improve the constraining results . and",
    "the different combinations of the data samples also give us the information that the parameter @xmath32 is confirmed in a high precision .    additionally , the relationships of sne and ohd in constraining jerk model should be noticed .",
    "as we know , the measurement of sne comes from the distance modulus , while ohd comes from the ages of passively evolving galaxies , bao measurement and so forth .",
    "if we regard the sne observations as the distance measurement , ohd should be related to the velocity measurement which is a time derivative of the distance .",
    "thus the information of acceleration or higher order derivative ( such as jerk , snap etc . ) can be obtained from distance or velocity measurement respectively .",
    "one question is that what is the difference when we use distance and velocity respectively to study the acceleration or jerk ?",
    "an important issue is the error propagation .",
    "the number of derivative from distance to acceleration or higher - order variables is bigger than that from velocity to them .",
    "so this may increase the uncertainty in estimating the acceleration and jerk . from this point of view",
    ", the ohd should be a better tool in studying the evolution of the universe , especially when we hope to find more accurate and subtle information of the universe since this kind of information can be well carried by the higher order derivative of the scale factor .",
