    "the influence of fracture and mass transport affects physical processes that govern many engineering applications , such as deterioration of construction materials and performance of waste barriers . in these applications , it is important to consider the influence of fracture induced pathways for the ingress of fluids . modelling the discrete crack formations , and",
    "the mass transport along these cracks and through the surrounding uncracked material , is challenging .",
    "models for this coupling are commonly based on continuum mechanics combined with a discrete representation of cracks @xcite .",
    "alternatively , discrete approaches , such as discrete element method , lattice and network models , have been proposed to model these processes @xcite .",
    "one network approach , based on the delaunay tessellation of a random set of points , has been shown to be suitable for modelling fracture @xcite and mass transport @xcite , providing mesh insensitive results . in this approach",
    ", the physical processes are modelled by a multi - dimensional network of one - dimensional elements , which are placed on the delaunay edges ( figure  [ fig:2d]a ) ; the element properties are determined by the corresponding voronoi tessellation .",
    "the nodes of the elements of structural and transport network models coincide , which is suitable for modelling the coupling of continuum fields .",
    "however , once cracks are formed , the transport elements in this approach are orientated perpendicular to the crack path , which is aligned with the mid - cross - section of the structural elements ( figure  [ fig:2d]b ) .",
    "this misalignment of the transport elements with the crack path complicates the modelling of crack - assisted transport and its dependence on crack opening . to resolve this deficiency ,",
    "several researchers  @xcite have placed transport elements on the voronoi edges , whereas the structural elements remain on the delaunay edges ( figure  [ fig:2d]c ) . with this dual network approach ,",
    "the influence of fracture on transport is more naturally represented , since the transport elements are aligned with the potential crack directions .",
    "so far , most of this work was either limited to 2d or did not provide coupling between fracture and transport .",
    "this work proposes a three - dimensional dual network approach for modelling fracture and mass transport .",
    "structural elements are placed on the edges of delaunay tetrahedra and transport elements are placed on the edges of voronoi polyhedra .",
    "special attention is given to the discretisation of the dual networks at domain boundaries .",
    "simple geometric relationships based on voronoi and delaunay tessellations are proposed for describing the change of permeability as a function of crack opening . by a series of benchmarks",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the present approach can describe fracture , transport , and the increase of permeability due to fracture mesh - independently .",
    "fracture is modelled by means of a cohesive - frictional approach , which is suitable for geomaterials , such as concrete and rocks in which the size of the fracture process zone is large compared to the size of the structure .",
    "transport is modelled by means of darcy s flow equation .",
    "the proposed model is designed to describe the effect of cohesive fracture on conductivity .",
    "the new network approach uses one - dimensional elements connected in a three - dimensional network to describe continuum fields as well as evolutions of discontinuities in the form of fracture process zones . in the present section , the discretisation and mechanical equations of the structural and transport parts",
    "are discussed . at the end of each section ,",
    "the input parameters for the individual parts are presented .",
    "the dual network approach is based on the delaunay and voronoi tessellations of a set of points placed randomly within the domain .",
    "the points are placed sequentially while enforcing a minimum distance @xmath0 between all points ; trial points that fail the minimum distance criterion are rejected .",
    "the delaunay tessellation decomposes the domain into tetrahedra whose vertices coincide with the randomly placed points ; the voronoi tessellation divides the domain into polyhedra associated with the random points  @xcite .",
    "these geometrical arrangements of delaunay and voronoi tessellations are used to define the structural and transport elements .",
    "figure  [ fig:3dtess]a shows a delaunay tetrahedron and the voronoi facet associated with delaunay edge @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "the structural elements are placed on the delaunay edges with their mid - cross - sections defined by the facets of the voronoi polyhedra ( figure  [ fig:3dtess]b ) .",
    "analogous to the structural network , the transport elements are placed on the edges of the voronoi polyhedra , with their cross - sections formed by the facets of the delaunay tetrahedra ( figure  [ fig:3dtess]c ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     whereas this example involves mode i fracture , the scalar damage model presented in section   [ sec : structuralmaterial ] allows for damage development under more general loading patterns .",
    "modification  of conductivity to account for fracture , according to equation ( [ eq : consplit ] ) and equation ( [ eq : crackdiff ] ) , is appropriate when the crack is open . in this sense",
    ", the proposed model should be applicable to cases of mixed - mode loading within the tension - shear regime .",
    "residual influences after crack closure , or possible modification of conductivity due to damage in the compression - shear regime , require additional study .",
    "a new three - dimensional network approach for modelling the effect of fracture on mass transport has been proposed .",
    "the delaunay tessellation of an unstructured set of points defines the structural network , which represents material elasticity and fracture .",
    "the edges of the corresponding voronoi diagram define the network of transport elements , which simulate mass transport .",
    "a distinctive feature of the dual network approach is the alignment of transport elements with potential pathways for crack propagation .",
    "several benchmark comparisons have been presented involving non - stationary transport , fracture , and their coupling .",
    "the following conclusions and remarks can be made .    *",
    "the network of structural elements , defined by the delaunay edges , provides element geometry and size independent load - displacement curves , as demonstrated through cohesive fracture simulations of double cantilever beams .",
    "the traction free condition is approached without stress locking .",
    "local deviations of the fracture path due to random network generation has very little influence on the load - displacement curves . *",
    "the network of transport elements , defined by the voronoi edges , provides results for non - stationary transport which are in very good agreement with analytical solutions , and are independent of element geometry and size .",
    "the proposed discretisation scheme for the transport network facilitates the enforcement of boundary conditions .",
    "local to a domain boundary , transport elements have one node on the boundary and are directed perpendicular to the  boundary .",
    "* the proposed method for coupling the effect of crack opening , determined by the structural network , with transport properties of the transport network yields objective results with respect to element geometry and size .",
    "this dual network approach facilitates the simulation of transport along crack paths and from crack faces into the bulk material .",
    "the proposed coupling is limited to the effect of fracture on transport .",
    "a two - way coupling of field quantities ( i.e. , including the dependence of structural behaviour on the transport field  @xcite ) is a natural extension of this work .",
