    "as is well - known the seminal black - scholes analysis @xcite which leads to the fair value of an option is based mainly upon the following assumptions .",
    "first the stock price , i.e. the underlying , follows a geometric brownian motion .",
    "second a hedge position is formed with a portfolio of short underlying and a long position of a number of european options .",
    "then an arbitrage argument leads to the renowned black  scholes partial differential equation determining the value of the option .",
    "of course , for simple cases , e.g. constant interest rate and volatility , explicit analytical solutions to the equation are known @xcite . however , for more involved cases one has to rely upon numerical methods .",
    "here we are not concerned with deterministic methods , e.g. finite differences , but rather with monte carlo methods @xcite .",
    "+ the idea behind the canonical monte carlo method is to exploit the fact that the fair value of an option is given by the present value of the expected payoff at expiry under the risk neutral measure .",
    "thus the standard monte carlo approach is based upon the simulation of a geometric brownian motion for the underlying asset until expiry . then the payoff is computed and discounted up to the current time . by averaging over different realizations of this stochastic process the current option price is estimated @xcite . in spirit",
    "this approach is similar to the standard monte carlo random walk technique for the solution of partial differential equations with boundary value problems @xcite .",
    "+ monte carlo methods offer easy to understand numerical algorithms which can be easily applied to quite complicated , e.g. path dependent or correlated multi - asset , options @xcite .",
    "in addition they allow for a straightforward inclusion of stochastic terms such as the interest rate or volatility . from a numerical point of view",
    "they are especially suited to problems with many degrees of freedom and the algorithm can be easily run in parallel .",
    "+ however monte carlo simulations of the black - scholes equation are usually slower than comparable finite difference solutions of the partial differential equation .",
    "another disadvantage of the standard monte carlo approach is that while the application to european options is straightforward , the valuation of american options is more involved . using a generalisation of the canonical monte carlo method one has to assure that the early exercise condition stating that the option price is always above the current payoff is not violated sometime in the future .",
    "if this happens and the option value is below the payoff , the option is exercised and the option value is given by the payoff function .",
    "a monte carlo simulation based on the dynamics of the underlying asset has to keep track of all these points in asset time space which makes the algorithm ineffective .",
    "nevertheless more advanced monte carlo algorithms are available @xcite .",
    "+ since the monte carlo methods described above are based on a model of the underlying dynamics of asset values these approaches could be named microscopic .",
    "in contrast now we are going to follow a different strategy , which we would like to name mesoscopic , which has already been applied with success to simulations of turbulence in fluid dynamics @xcite , to the investigation of hydrodynamic fluctuations @xcite as well as to magnetohydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the same approach has been shown to lead to fast monte carlo algorithms for the balance equations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics @xcite , for the simulation of chemical reactions @xcite and reaction  diffusion processes @xcite .",
    "+ the basic idea of the mesoscopic approach @xcite is to regard the value of the option , say @xmath0 as the expectation value of an underlying fluctuating ( mesoscopic ) stochastic option value , say @xmath1 . a master equation for @xmath1 is easily constructed in such a way that the expectation value of the multivariate stochastic variable @xmath1 satisfies the macroscopic black  scholes equation . the stochastic process defined in terms of a master equation is easily simulated and allows for a monte carlo algorithm for the direct simulation of the black  scholes equation .",

    "[ sec : mast - equat - form ] a master equation for the mesoscopic fair option value is constructed , and a stochastic simulation algorithm is applied to the valuation of european and american options . in the last section perspectives and further development of the approach are indicated .",

    "these so called jump diffusion models , are used e.g. to incorporate the effect of information about stocks which arrives at random times @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the standard derivation of the black  scholes equation based on ( [ eq : ds ] ) , this section demonstrates how the derivation can be paralleled by modelling the underlying in terms of a piecewise deterministic process @xcite .",
    "this is possible since a diffusion process can be represented as the continuous limit of an appropriate jump process .",
    "this approach , despite describing the same dynamics as the standard approach , has the advantage of clearly demonstrating that it is quite obvious to interpret the option value as a stochastic variable and thus to interpret the black  scholes equation as the macroscopic expectation value of a mesoscopic stochastic option value .",
    "in addition the formulation in terms of pdps simplifies the inclusion of additional jump processes since one has to deal only with one type of stochastic process .",
    "another important point is that for such processes one can easily proceed to a master equation formulation , for which powerful numerical algorithms exist , as will be shown later on .",

    "hence the traditional black - scholes equation can be interpreted as the expectation value of a stochastic process .",
    "additional not infinitesimal jump processes can now easily be included , but this of course will change the hedging strategy @xcite and the expectation value of the option price will then follow equations similar to the black  scholes equation .      the above derivation",

    "as seen in section [ sec : black - schol - poisson ] the black  scholes equation can be interpreted as a deterministic equation which governs the expectation value of a stochastic option price . in this section",

    "+ using the standard black  scholes equation as an example we have demonstrated how to construct such numerically efficient stochastic processes underlying the partial differential equation . as can be seen from the derivation of the general theory in section [ sec : general - theory ] ,",

    "scholes equation but can be applied to generalisations of the latter .",
    "+ the master equation formulation of the black  scholes equation is numerically about a factor of two faster than the standard monte carlo approach .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the proposed mesoscopic approach does not simulate sample trajectories of the underlying asset which , after averaging , results in the option price for the initial asset value at a given time .",
    "in contrast to this the mesoscopic approach works in the whole asset time space and generates sample option prices in the whole state space during one realization and is hence much faster .",
    "+ another advantage of the master equation formulation of the black  scholes equation is that it allows for a straightforward generalisation to price american options in the same framework by just comparing the average option price with the payoff function .",
    "+ summarising , the proposed master equation approach is located in between the standard monte carlo approach for the simulation of the underlying asset and the finite difference solution of the partial differential equation .",
    "this approach tries to combine the numerical efficiency of the solution of the partial differential equation with the advantages of the monte carlo approach .",
    "the main advantage of the monte carlo approach is that it can easily be applied to price options using also advanced stochastic models for the underlying .",
    "+ concluding , the mesoscopic approach we have formulated has been exploited to implement a master equation approach to option pricing .",
    "of course , it will be of great interest to investigate in further work if features of real markets correspond to the additional freedom to choose the size of the fluctuations contained in the proposed master equation formulation",
