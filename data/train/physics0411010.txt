    "the first experiments which showed the effect of the radiation pressure of an electromagnetic field on matter predicted by maxwell were done at the beginning of the last century @xcite . since then , the success of applying the light force in a controlled way to cool gaseous atomic clouds to temperatures around , and even below , the @xmath1k range has given a huge impetus to the field of cold atomic physics .",
    "laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms has been a very rapidly developing field of physics since the mid - eighties when experimentalists succeeded for the first time to optically trap laser cooled atoms @xcite .",
    "more recent milestones include the experimental realizations of atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite , fermi degenerate dilute quantum gas @xcite , superfluid  mott - insulator phase transition in optical lattices @xcite , molecular bec @xcite , and evidence for superfluidity in an atomic fermi gas @xcite .",
    "in general , the slow motion of the laser cooled atoms changes drastically the collision dynamics of the atoms compared to room temperature gases .",
    "the collisions may become inelastic and the research on cold collisions in magneto - optical traps ( mots ) has shown how the collisions consequently limit the densities and temperatures of atomic gases in mots @xcite . the purpose of this article is to describe and review the work which has been done to extend the regime of cold collision studies to optical lattices .",
    "this tutorial gives a simple introduction to one specific cooling and trapping scheme for neutral atoms : near - resonant , dissipative optical lattices , and concentrates on the description of light - assisted cold collisions in this system .",
    "a thorough introduction into the field of laser cooling , trapping , and optical lattices can be found from a text book @xcite , various review articles @xcite , and summer school lecture notes @xcite .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : optlat ] gives a short introduction to near - resonant , dissipative optical lattices .",
    "we describe both the red- and blue - detuned lattices .",
    "the latter are sometimes in the literature referred also as gray or dark optical lattices due to the reduced number of scattered photons compared to `` bright '' red - detuned optical lattices .",
    "section [ sec : colcol ] describes the basic cold collision mechanisms in the presence of a near - resonant light , radiative heating by the red - detuned light and optical shielding by the blue - detuned light .",
    "section [ collisionsinlattice ] shows a formulation of the cold collision problem in optical lattices and overviews the central results .",
    "finally , we conclude with a few remarks in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "a disordered cold atomic gas can be arranged into an ordered structure by periodic optical potentials which are created with suitably chosen set of interfering laser beams @xcite .",
    "an optical lattice formed by optical potentials does not only trap the atoms , but it is also able to cool them via optical pumping and sisyphus mechanism @xcite .",
    "the typical temperature range for alkali metal atoms cooled and trapped in optical lattices falls between the so called doppler limit @xmath2 and recoil limit @xmath3 .",
    "the doppler limit gives lower bound for doppler cooling , the main cooling mechanism in mots , and can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is planck s constant @xmath6 divided by @xmath7 , @xmath8 the atomic linewidth , and @xmath9 boltzmann s constant .",
    "the recoil limit in turn describes the lower bound for polarization gradient cooling mechanisms , and @xmath3 corresponds to the amount of energy of single photon absorption or emission recoil , and is given by @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the wavenumber of the cooling lasers , and @xmath12 the mass of an atom .",
    "the corresponding energy unit @xmath13 is consequently called recoil energy . a typical alkali element used for laser cooling , cs , has @xmath14k and @xmath15k .",
    "the modern work on optical lattices was preceded by the proposal of letokhov to trap cold atoms in one dimension by using a standing light wave @xcite , and accompanied by the experiment of burns _ et al . _ who created crystal structures of microscopic dielectric objects suspended in liquid by standing light waves @xcite .",
    "because of the purity and ease of control in optical lattices , the trapped atoms are almost ideal for the study of phenomena which are familiar from solid - state physics . a few examples of these phenomena , which have been realized in experiments , include the bragg scattering @xcite , bloch oscillations @xcite , and wannier - stark ladders @xcite .",
    "other interesting observations include the quantum zeno effect @xcite and dynamical tunneling @xcite . during the last few years",
    ", the amount of research exploiting optical lattices has hugely increased .",
    "this is mainly because now it is possible to load far - off resonant optical lattices with bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "this has led to the observation of superfluid  mott - insulator phase transition in far - detuned optical lattices @xcite which paved the way e.g. to the creation of multiparticle entanglement by exploiting controlled collisions @xcite . for dissipative optical lattices ,",
    "a so called double lattice creates interesting prospects for the future studies @xcite . in a double lattice ,",
    "the atoms on two ground hyperfine states can be trapped and moved in a controllable way with respect to each other .",
    "this opens a new avenue to study inelastic cold collisions in the presence of near - resonant light in dissipative lattices .",
    "the simplest case of cooling in optical lattices can be described by using the atomic level structure with the ground state angular momentum @xmath16 and the excited state @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "a single atom has two ground state sublevels @xmath18 and four excited state sublevels @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where the half ",
    "integer subscripts indicate the quantum number @xmath21 of the angular momentum along the @xmath22 direction .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels1 ] with the appropriate squares of the clebsch - gordan coefficients which describe the relative strengths of the light - induced couplings between the various levels .",
    "the laser field consists of two counter  propagating beams along the @xmath22-axis with orthogonal linear polarizations and with frequency @xmath23 .",
    "the total field has a polarization gradient in one dimension and reads ( with suitable choices of phases of the beams and origin of the coordinate system ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the amplitude and @xmath11 the wavenumber .",
    "with this field , the polarization changes from circular @xmath26 to linear and back to circular in the opposite direction @xmath27 when @xmath22 changes by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the wavelength of the lasers .",
    "the periodic polarization gradient of the laser field is reflected in the periodic light shifts , i.e. , ac  stark shifts , of the atomic sublevels creating the optical lattice structure .",
    "figure [ fig : lattice ] displays a schematic view of the optical potentials and shows how the lattice wells coincide with the points of pure circular polarization of the light field .",
    "when the atomic motion occurs in a suitable velocity range , the optical pumping of the atom between the ground state sublevels reduces the kinetic energy of the atom  @xcite . after several cooling cycles the atom localizes into an optical potential well , i.e. , into an optical lattice site .",
    "figure  [ fig : localization ] shows the optical pumping cycles between the ground state sublevels and the oscillations of the atomic wave packet after localization into a lattice site .",
    "the intensity of the laser field and the strength of the coupling between the field and the atom is described by the rabi frequency @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the atomic dipole moment of the strongest transition between the ground and excited states .",
    "the detuning of the laser field from the atomic resonance is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the atomic resonance frequency .",
    "as a unit for @xmath34 and @xmath35 the atomic linewidth @xmath8 is commonly used .",
    "the hamiltonian for a single atom moving in the laser field given in eq.([eq : efield ] ) is after the rotating wave approximation @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is the kinetic energy , @xmath35 the detuning of the laser , @xmath38 is the projection operator onto the excited state , and the interaction between a single atom and the field is @xmath39 where @xmath22 is the position operator of the atom .",
    "the spatially modulated optical potentials read @xmath40 for ground states",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively  @xcite . here , @xmath43 is the modulation depth of the lattice .",
    "when the steady state is reached after a certain period of cooling , atoms are , to a large extent , localized into the lattice sites .",
    "the optical lattice is in the oscillating regime if the atom completes on average more than one oscillation in the site before being optically pumped to a neighboring site . for less than one average oscillation per site",
    ", the lattice is in the jumping regime .",
    "the laser parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 determine in which of the regimes the lattice is in  @xcite . it must be noted that tight localization and occupation of the lowest vibrational levels of a periodic lattice potential increases the optical pumping time , and the time of localization within a single lattice site becomes longer compared to the semiclassical values @xcite . since we are mainly interested in the case when the two atoms undergo an intra - well collision , the chosen parameters in our work correspond to the jumping regime of the lattice .",
    "in our studies , the laser field is detuned a few atomic linewidths below @xcite or above @xcite the atomic transition .",
    "the most typical detuning range we use is @xmath44 towards the oscillating regime . whereas the most common range in the dissipative lattice experiments done so far is slightly higher , @xmath45 , and in the oscillating regime .",
    "two counterpropagating orthogonally polarized blue - detuned ( @xmath46 ) laser beams can efficiently cool down atoms which have the level structure @xmath47 or @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "the lowest position - dependent eigenstate of the system is flat in this case and is not directly coupled to the light field at any point of space .",
    "thus , despite of the cooling , the atoms are not efficiently trapped .",
    "the problem can be circumvented by the use of either transverse @xcite or longitudinal @xcite magnetic fields with respect to the laser propagation axis .",
    "we have used for collision studies the proposal of grynberg and courtois with a magnetic field along the laser axis @xcite , see below .",
    "we note that there exists also possibilities to create blue - detuned gray lattices by all - optical means  @xcite .",
    "an applied longitudinal magnetic field removes the degeneracy of the atomic states of blue - detuned optical molasses mentioned above , and produces the necessary spatial modulation for the optical potentials and the lattice structure  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the atomic states are now zeeman shifted by the magnetic field , and light shifted by the laser .",
    "the ratio between the two shifts can be varied by changing the intensity of the laser or the strength of the magnetic field . obviously , the two extreme regimes are : a ) the zeeman shift is small compared to the light shift b ) the light shift is small compared to the zeeman shift .    in case a ) , where the light shift dominates , the behavior of the lattice is paramagnetic and the increasing magnetic field strength increases the lattice modulation depth .",
    "when the zeeman shift dominates in the case b ) , the laser field produces perturbations to the zeeman shifted states .",
    "the situation resembles now the traditional sisyphus cooling scheme and the lattice is in the antiparamagnetic regime .",
    "we have done our collision studies in this antiparamagnetic regime .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : levels2 ] for the used atomic level configuration @xmath49 and fig .",
    "[ fig : opot2 ] for the corresponding optical lattice structure .",
    "we label the three ground state sublevels with @xmath50 , and the three excited state sublevels with latexmath:[$|e_{\\pm 1 } > ,    projection quantum number @xmath21 along the @xmath22-axis .",
    "because the standing laser field has only circular components , and the clebsch - gordan coefficient between @xmath52 and @xmath53 states is zero , the atoms are rapidly pumped to the @xmath54 subsystem of the whole state structure ; thus , in this level configuration , the atoms are trapped to the ground substates which have an angular momentum quantum number @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the excited state with @xmath52 provides a way for cooling optical pumping cycles between the two trapping ground substates .    after the rotating wave approximation the hamiltonian for the atomic system interacting with the laser field given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efield ] ) is @xmath57 here , @xmath58 is the projection operator , and the interaction between a single atom and the field is @xmath59 where @xmath22 is the position operator of the atom , and the rabi frequency @xmath34 is defined as @xmath60    the interaction with a magnetic field in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hblue ] ) is @xmath61 where the sum over @xmath62 includes all the ground and excited states , and the zeeman shift factors @xmath63 for the two trapping ground substates @xmath64 are equal .",
    "the level structure which we have used in our studies for a blue - detuned lattice can be found in @xmath65rb , which has @xmath66 hyperfine states for both the 5s@xmath67 ground state and the 5p@xmath67 excited state .",
    "this is actually the element and the level scheme which has been used in the blue - detuned lattice experiment of hemmerich _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , even though in their case the lattice structure and the orientation of the magnetic field differs from what is presented here .",
    "the reason for the choice we have made for the used level structure and an antiparamagnetic regime of the grynberg - courtois lattice is in their simplicity .",
    "the cooling mechanism resembles the traditional sisyphus cooling , making it more relevant to compare the results between the red and blue - detuning studies .",
    "moreover , it is necessary to use only three levels of the @xmath54-subsystem instead of all the six levels of a single atom .",
    "thus the number of product state basis vectors for interaction studies between the atoms can be reduced in the blue - detuned case .",
    "this reduces the computational resource requirements and speeds up the simulations when compared to red - detuned case ( which has to use all the six substates of a single atom for the interaction studies ) .",
    "thus for blue - detuned lattices it is easier to make a wider exploration of parameter space , if required .      because of the polarization gradients , the laser couples the multitude of zeeman substates of the atom in a position dependent way and the spontaneous emission caused by the coupling to the vacuum plays a crucial role in the optical pumping process",
    "thus , to describe the atomic motion in optical lattices one has to solve the problem of a multi - level atom coupled to a monochromatic laser field and to a quantized electromagnetic environment in its vacuum state .",
    "it is possible to treat the external laser field classically since the fields which are considered weak from the lattice point of view still contain a large number of photons .",
    "typical laser intensities used in experiments are a few mw/@xmath68 . the treatment of the interaction between a classical field and an atom is typically done with the rotating wave approximation , which neglects the terms that do not conserve the total energy .",
    "the general form of the task is to solve the master equation for the density matrix @xmath69 of the atomic system @xmath70 + { \\cal l}_{rel}\\left [ \\rho \\right ] , \\label{eq : master}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the system hamiltonian , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hred ] ) , ( [ eq : hblue ] ) , and @xmath72 includes the spontaneous emission part due to the coupling to the environment .",
    "it is extremely difficult to find the exact analytical solution for this equation even in the case of the simplest atomic level schemes used for optical lattices .",
    "one can try to find approximations which allow an analytical treatment , or the combination of analytical and numerical calculations to eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) .",
    "another possibility is to simulate the optical lattice system on a computer , especially , simulations by the monte carlo wave - function ( mcwf ) method may provide a convenient way to obtain the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) @xcite . in the case of laser cooling",
    ", the combinations of analytical and numerical treatments can treat 2d case @xcite , but the 3d problem has been solved so far only by the mcwf simulations @xcite .    a common feature for analytical treatments of optical lattices is the adiabatic elimination of the excited states , thus reducing the number of the levels in the problem at hand @xcite .",
    "one can then try to solve the master equation directly by numerical integration , introduce further approximations , or exploit the translational symmetry properties of the system @xcite .",
    "the mcwf method was originally developed for the problems in quantum optics , where in many of the cases the direct quantum - mechanical solution of the system density matrix is very difficult or impossible to obtain .",
    "the method has been applied e.g. to the resonance fluorescence spectrum of 1d optical molasses @xcite and to 3d laser cooling @xcite . for more examples ,",
    "see ref .  @xcite . by",
    "now the method has also been applied outside the field of quantum optics , e.g. into transport problems in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "the key idea of mcwf method is the generation of a large number of single wave function realizations which include stochastic quantum jumps of the system studied .",
    "the final result for the system density matrix and the system properties can then be calculated as ensemble averages of single realizations .",
    "section [ subsec : mcwf ] presents the method in more detail .",
    "we have chosen for our collision studies in optical lattices the mcwf method since it has been a widely used benchmark method for various semiclassical theories for cold collisions in mots @xcite .",
    "the method gives a full quantum - mechanical description of the atomic system ( the external laser field is still described classically ) and treats spontaneous decay in a rigorous way .",
    "a semiclassical version of the monte carlo ( mc ) method has also been developed for lattice studies @xcite and has been applied e.g. to study anisotropic velocity distributions in 3d dissipative optical lattices @xcite . this variant describes the external atomic degrees of freedom classically , and has limited applicability when the spread of the wave packet influences the dynamics of the system .",
    "this is the case when an atom is tightly localized into a lattice site and the spread of the packet affects essentially the optical pumping rate .",
    "moreover , the semiclassical approach can not treat , e.g. , the branching of the wave packet in optical lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : branching ] . for the branching of the packets , see e.g.  discussion in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the thermal velocities of the atoms in a laser cooled gas are on the order of centimeters per second , roughly four orders of magnitude less than in a room temperature gas .",
    "consequently , the collision dynamics is strikingly different within the two temperature regimes .",
    "the kinetic energies involved in the cold collision process are on the order or less than the energy of the atomic linewidth . for example , in the case of cesium the linewidth of a typical cooling transition is @xmath73e@xmath74 and a typical collision energy is around @xmath75e@xmath74 .",
    "slow atomic motion indicates that the decay time of the excitation becomes small compared to the time scale of the total collision dynamics .",
    "this allows new phenomena in cold collision processes to affect the thermodynamics of the cold atomic cloud @xcite .",
    "a general categorization of the dynamical interactions between atoms can be made by considering collisions occurring between two ground state or between one ground and one excited state atom .",
    "here we describe binary collisions between atoms of same element , i.e. , a homonuclear diatomic molecule , and the emphasis is on the collisions between a ground and an excited state atom which is the relevant scheme for dissipative optical lattices .    in the presence of near - resonant light",
    "the excitation of a quasimolecule formed by the colliding atoms may occur at an extremely long range , even on the order of few thousands of bohr radii a@xmath76 .",
    "molecular potentials at these long ranges are usually labeled by the hund s case ( c ) notation , where the component of the total electronic angular momentum along the internuclear axis is a good quantum number .",
    "the electron clouds of the colliding atoms do not overlap at long range , and the dominant interaction between the atoms is the resonant dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "we give a description of the resonant dipole - dipole interaction in section  [ subsec : dipdip ] , earlier calculations for alkali - metals can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the long range properties of molecular states and the sign of the detuning of the laser with respect the appropriate electronic transition define the possible consequences of collisions . a repulsive or an attractive character of the molecular potential at",
    "long range arises due to the relative orientation of the dipole moments of the colliding atoms . in the case of a red - detuned laser , the resonance or condon point @xmath77 , occurs for an attractive state . for a blue - detuned laser @xmath77",
    "occurs for a repulsive state .",
    "depending on the magnitude of the detuning and the strength of the coupling laser , off - resonant excitation to a non - resonant state may also play a role @xcite .",
    "a very active research field of its own is the photoassociation of laser cooled atoms to molecules .",
    "photoassociation is typically done by using a large red detuning of the laser so that free atom pair is excited at @xmath77 to a well defined bound molecular vibrational state .",
    "especially photoassociation in an atomic bose - einstein condensate has attracted wide interest recently @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss further photoassociation here but the reader can find presentations of the field e.g. from refs .",
    "@xcite .      with red - detuned light , the population of the quasimolecule formed by the two collision partners may get resonantly excited into an attractive excited state at the condon point @xmath77 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : radiativeheating ] ) .",
    "the relative velocity of the atoms increases due to the acceleration on the attractive state until spontaneous emission terminates the process .",
    "when the atoms have again bounced apart due to the short range repulsion in the ground state , the pair may lose some of the gained kinetic energy in the reverse process , but to lesser degree .",
    "the overall effect is the heating of the colliding pair , and the escape of the atoms from the trap if the total gain in kinetic energy is large enough @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : radiativeheating ] shows a semiclassical ( sc ) schematic view of the process . in some of the parameter regimes sc descriptions , such as the landau - zener level crossing model , can be used @xcite . when the sc models fail , full quantum - mechanical methods are needed .",
    "for example , mcwf simulations @xcite can be used as a benchmark method for simpler analytical semiclassical calculations .",
    "it should be emphasized that it is difficult in sc models to account for population recycling , which means that once - decayed population may get re - excited in strong laser fields .",
    "a comparison between various methods and their application range is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "most of the radiative heating studies done so far have used a simple two - state description with one ground and one excited molecular electronic state .",
    "an example of mcwf simulation results for mot from ref .",
    "@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhinmot ] .",
    "the results demonstrate radiative heating via the spreading of the momentum distributions .",
    "the effect clearly becomes stronger as the initial collision momentum , i.e. , cloud temperature , decreases .",
    "we emphasize that our lattice studies include many attractive and repulsive states simultaneously , see section [ subsec : dipdip ] .",
    "in addition to radiative heating , atoms may also escape from the trap by the fine - structure change mechanism .",
    "if the population survives on the excited state for small enough relative distance between the two atoms , the point where two fine - structure states have a crossing may be reached .",
    "now , if the pair comes out from the collision in an energetically lower fine - structure state than the one in which they entered the collision , the pair gains kinetic energy by the amount corresponding to the fine - structure splitting of the atomic electronic states at large @xmath78 .",
    "this energy difference is usually large compared to the trap depths , and consequently in this case the atoms escape from the trap @xcite .",
    "we deal in our studies with very small detunings , a few atomic linewidths only , and strong laser fields .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the effect of fine - structure changing collisions on the cloud temperature is very small compared to the effect of radiative heating processes , and we neglect the fine - structure change loss mechanism in our lattice studies .",
    "the assumption is also supported by the fact that there can be an order of magnitude difference between the fine - structure state crossing point and @xmath77 for the small detunings we have used .",
    "when blue - detuned light is used , the resonant excitation at the condon point occurs to a repulsive excited quasimolecular state .",
    "this makes it possible to shield the atoms from close encounters @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : shielding ] .",
    "if the shielding is efficient , collisions between atoms may become completely elastic .",
    "the mechanism would obviously be useful for preventing loss of atoms in optical lattices formed with a near - resonant blue - detuned light .    in an optical shielding process",
    ", the resonantly excited quasimolecule population reaches the classical turning point on the repulsive excited state and the atoms begin to move apart again . the shielding becomes complete if all the population has been excited , no spontaneous decay has occurred , and all the population returns resonantly to the ground state at the condon point . in this case",
    ", collisions become elastic ( when photon recoil effects are ignored ) , and no heating or escape occurs due to the inelastic processes . moreover ,",
    "the ground state is emptied at a relatively long range , and no population reaches short distances where unwanted processes are possible , such as hyperfine state changing collisions .",
    "thus , the possibility to use optical shielding in an efficient way allows to increase the occupation density of the dissipative lattice , in addition to the benefit of reducing the rate of scattered and reabsorbed photons and the consequent effects .    in the past",
    "the mcwf simulations have described the efficiency of the shielding process in a mot by a shielding measure @xmath79 , which essentially describes the flux of the ground state population to the short range beyond the condon point @xmath77 @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : osinmot ] . in the case of optical lattices ,",
    "a more descriptive result is the momentum distribution in a steady state compared between interacting and non - interacting atoms @xcite .",
    "in addition of the mcwf simulations , fig .  [",
    "fig : osinmot ] displays also various semiclassical landau - zener results for the shielding measure . in the basic landau - zener approach ( lz ) , the calculation of the excitation probability is based on the linear level crossing model and assuming narrow initial wave packet in momentum space @xcite .",
    "the landau - zener model with decay ( lzd ) takes into account the exponential decay of the population from the excited electronic state @xcite whereas the landau - zener model with delayed decay ( lzdd ) accounts also for the re - excitation of the once decayed population due to the strong laser field @xcite .    in this section",
    "we have described radiative heating and optical shielding processes by using the molecular state description .",
    "this is how the treatment has usually been done in the past when studying the heating and loss of atoms in mots . in our calculations and simulations",
    "we use the two - atom product state presentation instead .",
    "our aim is to study the effect of collisions in a near - resonant optical lattice .",
    "most of the photon scattering still occurs when the atoms are outside the range of a binary interaction .",
    "it would be an unnecessary complication to describe photon scattering and quantum jumps in a lattice by using a molecular basis .",
    "moreover , we give a simultaneous description for laser cooling and collision processes .",
    "hence , in our case the molecular basis is only used for a qualitative description of radiative heating and optical shielding processes , but it does not appear directly in our calculations .",
    "in the past cold binary collisions between atoms have been widely studied under conditions which correspond to the atoms trapped in magneto - optical traps @xcite .",
    "previous cold collision research has concentrated on the effects of inelastic collisions on the properties of an atomic cloud , but has neglected the co - existence of the cooling processes .",
    "we are dealing with near - resonant optical lattices , and we have combined in a single framework the cooling and cold collision dynamics . thus our approach includes simultaneous dynamical processes of cooling , trapping , and collisions in atom gas .    for far off - resonant lattices the possibility to control the cold collisions coherently has been proposed @xcite and realized in an experiment @xcite .",
    "this allows the creation of an entanglement between the atoms , a step towards quantum computing in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "moreover , the observation of superfluid  mott - insulator phase transition helps in filling in the sites of the far - off resonant lattice by controlled particle number @xcite . for dissipative optical lattices ,",
    "the creation of a double optical lattice opens interesting prospect for cold collision studies in the presence of near - resonant light @xcite .",
    "radiative heating and optical shielding studies in mots typically use the molecular state description of the binary atomic system . after choosing the specific excited molecular state and doing the partial wave expansion ,",
    "usually only the lowest relative angular momentum ground and excited state are accounted .",
    "the other option has been to consider independent pairs of partial wave states , neglecting the coupling between the pairs in a weak field approximation @xcite .",
    "thus the descriptions in the past have been two - state models , neglecting the multitude of internal states of the atoms , and without the position dependent coupling between the atoms and the laser field . for optical lattices",
    "the internal states of the atoms have to be accounted because of the spatial periodicity of the coupling caused by the polarization gradients of the laser field .",
    "we use the two - atom product state basis @xcite . for two six - level atoms in the red - detuned case",
    "this means @xmath80 basis states .",
    "if the basis is transformed into a molecular one , there are manifolds of attractive and repulsive molecular states buried in our description . we are forced to do the calculations in one dimension since the limited amount of computational resources .",
    "it is also worth noting that the simple atomic level schemes we consider , do not allow to account for the spatially dependent adiabatic couplings between the atomic states which play a role in the system dynamics for more complex level schemes  @xcite .",
    "a resonant dipole - dipole interaction between the atoms in optical lattices has been studied with nondynamic approaches @xcite .",
    "usually these studies assume fixed positions for the atoms and concentrate on the mean - field type descriptions of the lattice system .",
    "these approaches neglect the dynamical nature of the cold collisions , and the inelastic processes of radiative heating or incomplete optical shielding .",
    "our approach includes the dynamical processes of cooling and cold collisions in the same framework .",
    "it is important to note that once the atoms are localized into the optical lattice sites , they are still able to move around in the lattice . for shallow lattices this is because the quantum - mechanical tunneling probability between the lattice sites is not negligible . for deep optical lattices , which are more relevant to our case",

    "rich dynamical features of the wave packet , like breathing and oscillations in a single lattice site , arise due to the fact that the packet here describes a superposition of the populations in the vibrational states of a lattice potential @xcite .    since the high kinetic energy atoms are more mobile compared to their low kinetic energy partners , the high kinetic energy atoms have also a higher collision probability . during the same period of time",
    "the high - energy atoms change their internal ground state and the corresponding optical potential more often than tightly localized atoms .",
    "thus , the coverage of various lattice sites , and the corresponding collision probability , is higher for more mobile atoms .    with these assumptions",
    "the consequence of collisions might be simple heating of the atomic cloud , or escape of the atoms from the lattice .",
    "the essential ingredient for a large kinetic energy increase is a high excitation probability of a quasimolecule .",

    "the optical lattice modulation depth defines the initial velocity distribution of the atoms when they start to move between the lattice sites after localization .",
    "it turns out that in a lattice , detuned a few atomic linewidths below the atomic resonance , and for lattice depths of a few hundred recoil energies , the surroundings are very favorable for strong excitation of the quasimolecule and the corresponding large kinetic energy changing collisions .",
    "the consequence is that the atoms mainly leave the lattice when colliding , and the total effect is the ejection of the hot atoms from the lattice .",

    "the rethermalization of the remaining atoms is more limited , though .",

    "the prospect of using the trapping and cooling lasers for efficient optical shielding has been studied in ref .  @xcite .",
    "complete optical shielding would make collisions between atoms , when they end up in a same lattice site , elastic , and it would also prevent atoms from close encounters , reducing , e.g. , inelastic hyperfine changing collisions",

    "even though the available occupation densities in near - resonant optical lattices have been very low so far , the metastable rare - gas atoms could provide a convenient case for an experimental study of shielding in optical lattices due to the clear ion signal that marks collision events @xcite .",
    "the experimental work on optical shielding in mots show the saturation of the shielding phenomena when the intensity of the laser field is increased @xcite .",

    "@xcite seem to confirm the view that the saturation does not arise due to spontaneous emission effects @xcite .",
    "the reason for the saturation of shielding is still unclear .",

    "the partial wave description is a useful frame of reference in normal collision studies to allow for more than one dimension . due to the low collision velocities",
    "one can limit the studies to a few waves only .",
    "but the presence of an optical lattice forces us to abandon this description . since our model is , due to the computational limitations , only one - dimensional , we can not conclusively that saturation of shielding should be absent in a lattice experiment .",
    "so far there has been very few cold collision experiments in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "these experiments showed how the lattice structure affects the transport of atoms by using collisions as a probe .",
    "we hope that our work serves as a motivation for experimentalists to do shielding studies in blue - detuned optical lattices .      the results of refs .",
    "@xcite show that in our selected parameter regime , i.e. , the parameter regime for near - resonant lattices , the motion of the atom _ between _ the lattice sites ( or in the lattice site occupied by the single atom only ) is not strongly affected by other atoms , not at least for the occupation densities which we have used ( maximum @xmath143 ) .",
    "hence , binary interactions between the atoms come into play only when two atoms simultaneously occupy the same lattice site .",
    "this makes it possible to develop a method to calculate the average rate at which two atoms end up in the same site , and the consequent cold collision rate in a lattice , by following the trajectories of single atoms @xcite .",
    "cold collision rate refers here to the average rate of atoms to reach the region of the resonant condon point in the presence of near - resonant light and describes the rate of occurrence of radiative heating events in a red - detuned lattice , or optical shielding events , if blue - detuned light is used .",
    "it is assumed that the two atoms always collide when they end up in the same lattice site .",
    "for the parameters used here , this assumption is confirmed by the results in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the developed method is as follows .",
    "a possible trajectory of an atom in optical lattice is given by a single mcwf realization .",
    "trajectories in position space can then give information about the rate at which atoms travel over the average distance @xmath149 between the atoms , which in turn gives information about the binary collision rate in a lattice .",
    "the average distance between atoms @xmath149 corresponds to the mean free path of atoms between collision events in our one - dimensional model .",
    "thus , if we monitor the transport of atoms in the lattice over the average distance between the atoms , or the atomic flux over the average distance , we also obtain information about the collision rates .",
    "figure [ fig : crates1 ] displays the calculated collision rates as a function of the occupation density of the lattice for three different lattice depths @xcite . in our simple 1d case the collision rate does not depend on the scattering cross section and collisions are a measure of transport in a lattice .",

    "@xcite . in both cases",
    "the collision rate has a quadratic behavior .",
    "the points in fig .",
    "[ fig : crates1 ] are the simulation results and the solid lines quadratic fits .",
    "it is interesting to note from the monte carlo point of view that we get results for a wide density range by doing simulations for only a very few values of density .",
    "the possibility of obtaining the result for all the values of the variable , in this case occupation density , from single monte carlo ensemble is a new feature in the mcwf simulations to our knowledge , at least when the mcwf method is applied to cold collision problems .",
    "two - atom collision simulations in a lattice described in previous subsections are computationally very heavy",
    ". it would be useful to find more simple means to do collision studies in optical lattices .",
    "the method presented above presents a step in this direction .",
    "for example , if the semiclassical analysis shows that for particular parameter values the colliding atoms have a high probability to be ejected from the lattice due to radiative heating , then the collision rate described here gives directly the loss rate of atoms from the lattice .",
    "mcwf simulations for one atom , like the ones reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , are fairly simple and fast to perform .",
    "this is especially true when compared to the two - atom case .",

    "the implementation of the mcwf method to study cold collisions in optical lattices is not straightforward and the simulations have been very demanding from the computer resource point of view .",
    "this is due to the internal structure of atoms , coupling to the electromagnetic environment , position dependent coupling of the atoms to the laser field , and position dependent coupling between the atoms .",
    "the results for near - resonant red - detuned lattices are in quite a sharp contrast to the interaction studies in magneto - optical traps . instead of a heating , a cooling due to the selection of collision partners from high kinetic energy atoms",
    "is seen in the simulation results .",

    "the work presented in here extends the regime of cold collision studies into the realm of optical lattices .",

    "the major reason is that for sub - doppler cooling mechanisms , which exploit various polarization states of a laser field , it is necessary to account for the internal structure of atoms , and this greatly complicates the total system under study and the calculations .",

    "<S> the invention of laser cooling methods for neutral atoms allows optical and magnetic trapping of cold atomic clouds in the temperature regime below @xmath0mk . in the past </S>",
    "<S> , light - assisted cold collisions between laser cooled atoms have been widely studied in magneto - optical atom traps ( mots ) . </S>",
    "<S> we describe here theoretical studies of dynamical interactions , specifically cold collisions , between atoms trapped in near - resonant , dissipative optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of collision studies to the regime of optical lattices introduces several complicating factors . for the lattice studies </S>",
    "<S> , one has to account for the internal substates of atoms , position dependent matter - light coupling , and position dependent couplings between the atoms , in addition to the spontaneous decay of electronically excited atomic states . </S>",
    "<S> the developed one - dimensional quantum - mechanical model combines atomic cooling and collision dynamics in a single framework . </S>",
    "<S> the model is based on monte carlo wave - function simulations and is applied when the lattice - creating lasers have frequencies both below ( red - detuned lattice ) and above ( blue - detuned lattice ) the atomic resonance frequency . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out , that the radiative heating mechanism affects the dynamics of atomic cloud in a red - detuned lattice in a way that is not directly expected from the mot studies . </S>",
    "<S> the optical lattice and position dependent light - matter coupling introduces selectivity of collision partners . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms , which are most mobile and energetic , are strongly favored to participate in collisions , and are more often ejected from the lattice , than the slow ones in the laser parameter region selected for study . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the atoms remaining in the lattice have a smaller average kinetic energy per atom than in the case of non - interacting atoms . for blue - detuned lattices , </S>",
    "<S> we study how optical shielding emerges as a natural part of the lattice and look for ways to optimize the effect . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the cooling and shielding dynamics do not mix and it is possible to achieve efficient shielding with a very simple arrangement . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations are computationally very demanding and would obviously benefit from the simplification schemes . </S>",
    "<S> we present some steps to this direction by showing how it is possible to calculate collision rates in near - resonant lattices in a fairly simple way . </S>",
    "<S> the method can then be used to combine quantum - mechanical and semiclassical models for cold collision studies in optical lattices . </S>"
