    "observations at millimeter wavelengths ( @xmath4 mm ) have revealed that about 50% of classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) emit detectable millimeter continuum .",
    "the detection limit , @xmath5 mjy , of the @xmath6 mm observations by osterloh & beckwith ( 1995 ) corresponds to a minimum disk luminosity of @xmath7 , where we used the distance to the taurus - auriga molecular cloud , @xmath8 pc , while the typical value of the disk luminosity is @xmath9 ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ; ohashi et al .",
    "1991 , 1996 ) .",
    "the sizes of the disks that emit millimeter continuum are in a range between @xmath10 au ( dutrey et al .",
    "1996 ; kitamura et al . 2002 ) .",
    "only a small fraction ( @xmath11% ) of weak line t tauri stars ( wttss ) , however , have detectable emission at @xmath6 and @xmath12 mm ( osterloh & beckwith 1995 ; dutrey et al .",
    "1996 ; duvert et al .",
    "it is not clear whether the typical age of wttss is older than that of cttss , as both classes have similar age distributions between @xmath13 and @xmath14 yr ( kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) .",
    "however , the observations have made clear that the outer part ( @xmath15 au ) of the disk that emits millimeter continuum disappears in a timescale between @xmath1 and @xmath14 yr .",
    "the standard interpretation assumes that wttss are the older counterparts of cttss .",
    "a notable feature of the millimeter emission from cttss is the evolution of the spectral index from the interstellar value .",
    "the frequency dependence of the dust emissivity ( or the opacity ) @xmath16 is conventionally expressed as a power law , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the frequency of radio emission .",
    "beckwith & sargent ( 1991 ) argued that the value of the opacity index @xmath19 evolves from the interstellar value of 2 to @xmath20 for ctts disks ( see also mannings & emerson 1994 ; hogerheijde et al .",
    "this change in @xmath19 is probably due to dust evolution in the disks .",
    "however , because different directions of dust evolution ( such as in grain size , in chemical composition , and in grain shape ) can produce observable changes in the dust opacity , it is not easy to specify the cause of changing @xmath19 ( beckwith , henning , & nakagawa 2000 ) . among the above",
    "possible causes , dust growth is an attractive hypothesis in a context of planet formation .",
    "the effect of dust growth on the dust opacity was studied by miyake & nakagawa ( 1993 ) .",
    "their calculations showed that grain growth to 1 mm would produce a low @xmath19 value ( @xmath20 ) , but that it is difficult to explain @xmath21 as long as the maximum size of grains is smaller than @xmath22 . in this paper",
    ", we stand at the ground that the low @xmath19 is a sign of dust growth , and we assume that in the disks showing @xmath23 the dust grains have grown to @xmath24 mm .    in summary",
    ", radio observations have shown that about half of cttss emit detectable millimeter continuum .",
    "images of millimeter continuum show extended disks of @xmath10 au in size , while their wavelength dependences show the evolution of @xmath19 , suggesting grain growth to @xmath24 mm .",
    "millimeter continuum emissions of cttss last for @xmath25 yr .",
    "dust grains in a gas disk migrate to the central star due to gas drag ( see  [ sec : rad_mig ] ) .",
    "as grains grow larger , their orbital decay time becomes shorter .",
    "when the grain size becomes 1 cm , the decay time is only about @xmath13 yr , which is much shorter than the dust disk s life time observed for cttss .",
    "this dust growth and subsequent dust accretion induce a decline in millimeter emission from the disk .",
    "the millimeter emission would disappear in @xmath13 yr , if most of the dust mass had been confined in the largest grains of @xmath24 cm .",
    "thus , we expect that in ctts disks , there must remain sufficient dust grains less than 1 cm over @xmath1 yr",
    ". this expectation is confirmed in  [ sec : evo_den ] using numerical calculations . at the same time , however , the largest grain size must be larger than about 1 mm , if low @xmath19 is due to dust growth . very large bodies ( say @xmath3 m ) experience little migration , because such bodies almost completely decouple from the gas . however , such large bodies do not contribute to millimeter emission ( miyake & nakagawa 1993 ) .",
    "hence , in this paper we conclude that only a narrow range of the dust size , @xmath26 $ ] , can fulfill the requirement that the millimeter continuum having @xmath23 lasts over @xmath1 yr .",
    "our calculations suggest that the millimeter continuum of ctts disks is mainly emitted from grains of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the lifetime of observable millimeter continuum , @xmath28 yr , constrains the growth time of millimeter sized grains .",
    "one possibility is that millimeter sized grains do not grow to centimeter size in @xmath1 yr and they hold the millimeter continuum of @xmath29 .",
    "another possibility is rapid growth of grains in a context of planet formation : grains in ctts disks have already grown to sizes of @xmath3 m , which is large enough to resist gas drag and to reside in the disk more than @xmath1 yr .",
    "we consider these possibilities in  [ sec : growth ] .",
    "the observations discussed in the last section suggest that dust grains in circumstellar disks have grown to at least 1 mm .",
    "it is possible to consider that even at the ctts stage of @xmath1 yr the dust grains have grown to sizes much larger than 1 mm .",
    "however , the observations have not set any constraint on the largest size , and thus we know only its lower limit , @xmath30 mm . in order to choose a specific question , we focus on the epoch at which the largest grains have just grown to @xmath30 mm , i.e.",
    ", we assume that the largest size is of order of 1 mm .",
    "at such an epoch , the dust mass and the opacity are dominated by the largest grains ( @xmath30 mm ) as discussed below .",
    "hence , in the later sections , we consider only a single size of the largest grains .",
    "dust grains migrate inward to the star under the action of gas drag .",
    "the gas experiences a pressure gradient force , which usually cancels a part of the central star s gravity and induces slower rotation than the keplerian velocity .",
    "dust grains , whose orbits are hardly affected by gas pressure , are supposed to rotate with keplerian velocity , but experiencing headwind .",
    "they lose their angular momentum and spiral inward to the central star ( adachi , hayashi , & nakazawa 1976 ; weidenschilling 1977 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly consider dust grains smaller than 1 cm .",
    "for such small grains , gas drag obeys epstein s law , which is applicable when the mean free path of the gas molecules is larger than the grain size ( the mean free path is 7 cm at 1 au and larger at larger radii in our standard model ; see e.g. , nakagawa , sekiya , & hayashi 1986 ) .",
    "the gas drag force on a spherical grain is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the gas density , @xmath33 is the grain radius , @xmath34 is the mean thermal velocity of gas molecules , @xmath35 is the gas sound speed , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the velocities of the grain and the gas , respectively . the stopping time due to gas drag is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the grain mass , and @xmath40 is the physical density of an individual grain .",
    "we define the non - dimensional stopping time normalized by the orbital time as , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the distance from the star , @xmath43 is the keplerian angular velocity , @xmath44 is the keplerian velocity , and @xmath45 is the central star s mass .    the stopping time is proportional to the grain size , which means that the gas drag force is more effective for smaller grains . if a grain is small enough to have a stopping time much less than its orbital time ( @xmath46 ; this is true for grains of @xmath47 cm ) , it orbits with the almost same angular velocity as the gas has , which is sub - keplerian ( adachi et al .",
    "1976 ; weidenschilling 1977 ) .",
    "therefore , the centrifugal force on the grain is smaller than the stellar gravity , resulting in an inward acceleration by the residual gravity .",
    "this acceleration is however balanced by gas drag in the radial direction . after a stopping time - scale , which is smaller than the orbital time",
    ", the grain reaches a terminal falling velocity .",
    "this terminal velocity is slower for smaller grains because the stronger gas drag force per unit mass holds the grains more tightly with the gas . for large grains of @xmath48 ,",
    "the coupling between the grains and the gas is weak .",
    "they rotate with keplerian velocity and experience headwind from the gas .",
    "the inward drift speed of the grains is proportional to the angular momentum loss by gas drag ( @xmath49 ) per unit mass ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "thus , larger grains drift more slowly for @xmath48 regime .",
    "figure [ fig : driftvel ] shows the orbital decay time ( or the migration time @xmath51 defined in  [ sec : timescale ] ) of grains at 50 au in a disk model described below in  [ sec : diskmodel ] .",

    ", it is expected that grains of @xmath58 in the size range @xmath59 $ ] disappear from the disk within @xmath1 yr because of rapid accretion to the central star .",
    "we focus on the optical property of the dust at millimeter wavelengths , @xmath60 mm . as we assumed",
    "that the maximum size is of order of 1 mm , most grains are similar to or smaller than the observation wavelength , @xmath60 mm . the optical properties of such grains can be described according to rayleigh scattering theory .",
    "the absorption cross section , @xmath61 , of a spherical grain is proportional to its volume or mass ( van de hulst 1981 ) , i.e. , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the imaginary part of the refractive index , @xmath64 is the wavelength , and @xmath65 is the grain mass .",
    "the cross section per unit mass is independent of the grain size : @xmath66 .",
    "suppose a power - law grain size distribution .",
    "the number density of grains in a unit size range is @xmath67 the total cross section of grains in a unit volume is @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the minimum and maximum sizes of grains . if @xmath71 is less than 4 , the cross section is dominated by the largest grains . in such a case ,",
    "it is adequate to take only the largest grains in consideration of the dust opacity .",
    "when the largest grains have grown to sizes larger than @xmath11 m , it is expected that the dust size distribution of the disk has a void between @xmath59 $ ] , because of rapid accretion of grains to the star in this size range , as discussed in  [ sec : rad_mig ] .",
    "in addition , grains larger than 10 m hardly contribute to millimeter emission . the mass opacity of 10 m grains is @xmath72 times smaller than 1 mm grains ( fig . 4 in miyake & nakagawa 1993 ) .",
    "if most of the dust mass is concentrated in bodies larger than 10 m , the dust can not emit a millimeter flux strong enough to explain the observed values of cttss .",
    "hence , in consideration of the millimeter emission , the contribution of bodies larger than 10 m can be neglected .",
    "the size distribution of grains in the inter - stellar medium is considered to be a power - law with @xmath73 ( mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 ) .",
    "in circumstellar disks , however , the grains stick together and grow larger .",
    "the size distribution probably changes through this process .",
    "mizuno , markiewicz , & vlk ( 1988 ) found from their numerical simulations that after the grain growth more mass concentrates in the largest grains and that the power - law index becomes as small as @xmath74 . on the other hand , collisional destruction of grains",
    "may lead to a different distribution .",
    "hellyer ( 1970 ) analytically derived a power - law index @xmath75 for particles experiencing collisional fragmentation .",
    "while this is in agreement with the observed distribution of asteroids of sizes between @xmath76 km , recent observations show a shallower index for small asteroids of @xmath77 km ( yoshida et al .",
    "2003 ) . in either case",
    ", the largest bodies dominate the dust mass and the dust opacity at @xmath60 mm , as long as the largest size is less than @xmath30 mm .    in conclusion ,",
    "the above considerations in  [ sec : opacity ] and  [ sec : th_growth ] suggest focusing on the largest grains of @xmath30 mm . in the following sections , we investigate evolution of the dust density profile and the thermal flux emitted at millimeter wavelengths , both of which",
    "are dominated by the largest grains .",
    "as discussed in the last section , we consider disks at the epoch in which the largest grains are of order of 1 mm , and focus on the largest grains .",
    "we solve for the density evolution of a dust disk , assuming all grains are of a similar size of @xmath30 mm .",
    "contributions from smaller grains are neglected . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "the grain size is assumed to be constant with time and any effect caused by dust growth is ignored . from the numerical results , however , we discuss the constraint on the dust growth time - scale in  [ sec : growth ] below .      for simplicity , we assume that the gas disk has a power - law temperature profile @xmath78 in the radial direction @xmath42 , and is isothermal in the vertical direction @xmath79 . the profile is written as @xmath80 where the subscript `` 0 '' denotes quantities at 1 au , and a non - dimensional quantity @xmath81 is the radius in au .",

    "therefore , we assume all grains have the same size , which is of order of 1 mm . initially , the dust spreads over the entire gas disk , and its density profile @xmath92 is proportional to the gas density : @xmath93 where the initial dust - to - gas ratio @xmath94 is independent of @xmath42 .",
    "most of the disk is outside the ice condensation radius ( @xmath95 au ) , and the main composition of the dust is water ice . we ignore sublimation of water ice at the innermost part of the disk , because our interest is on the outer part that contributes to millimeter emission . the physical density of a compact grain is assumed to be @xmath96 .",
