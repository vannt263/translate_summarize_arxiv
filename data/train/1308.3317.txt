    "this distinctive feature of the economic version on its biological counterpart follows from a construction based on assumptions describing a closed capitalist economy .",
    "it can be done in three steps :    1 .   assume a leontief production function @xmath24 with full utilization of capital , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "here , @xmath26 is the yearly output , @xmath27 the invested capital , @xmath28 a capital - to - output ratio , @xmath29 is the average productivity of workers and @xmath30 is the size of the labor class .",
    "2 .   the capital depreciates and receives investment , i.e. , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the depreciation rate and @xmath6 the investment function .",

    "3 .   assume a reserve army effect for wage negotiation of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the real wage of the total working population , and @xmath7 is the phillips curve .",
    "defining @xmath36 allows to retrieve for @xmath37 .",
    "the class - struggle model has been extensively studied because it allows to generate endogenous real business cycles affecting the production level @xmath26 , e.g. @xcite . on this matter ,",
    "goodwin himself conceded that the model is `` starkly schematized and hence quite unrealistic '' @xcite .",
    "it hardly connects with irregular observed trajectories , see @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is thus to study the following perturbed version of by a standard brownian motion @xmath38 on a stochastic basis @xmath39 :    [ eq : stochastic_goodwin_1 ] \\ {    ll d x_t & = x_t (((y_t)-+ ^2(y_t))dt + ( y_t)dw_t ) + d y_t & = y_t (((x_t ) - + ^2(y_t ) ) dt + ( y_t)dw_t )    . , where @xmath40 is a positive function of @xmath23 bounded by @xmath41 , and the filtration @xmath42 is generated by paths of @xmath43 .",

    "ass : growth conditions ] , is assumed later on the behavior of @xmath40 to ensure that solutions of remain in @xmath0 .",
    "the example of section [ sec : example ] will also illustrate how such condition can hold .",
    "we modify the economic development ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) by introducing the perturbation on one assumption , namely we assume that for @xmath20 ,    [ eq : stochastic_productivity ] da_t : = a_t d_t = a_t  ( dt - ( y_t)dw_t ) , a_00 , instead of @xmath44 . using it formula with in the previous reasoning retrieves .",
    "productivity is one of the few exogenous parameters of the model , and one of those that were significantly invoked as influencial over business cycles , e.g. @xcite . without arguing for the pertinence of that particular assumption ,",
    "we simply suggest here that a standard continuous perturbation in this crucial parameter seems a good starting point .    to our knowledge , this is the first attempt to consider random noise in goodwin interpretation of the famous prey - predator model .",
    "to stay in the spirit of the economic application , the present paper studies the cyclical behavior of the deterministic system and the stochastic version .",
    "namely , our contribution are as follows , developed in the present order :    * in section [ sec : goodwin ] , we fully characterize solutions of and the period of their orbits .",

    "we provide a definition of stochastic orbits for . the proof that solutions of draw stochastic orbits in finite time around a unique point is given in section [ sec : proof ] .",
    "our contribution has to be put in contrast with numerous studies of random perturbations of the lotka - volterra system .",
    "apart from the obviously different origin of perturbations in the model , attention was mainly given to systems like for its asymptotic behavior ( e.g. , @xcite ) , regularity , persistence and extinction of species ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the addition of regimes , jumps or delay ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here , we attempt to provide a relevant description of trajectories @xmath45 and indirectly @xmath26 , namely a cyclical behavior .",
    "this is done using stochastic lyapunov techniques for recurrent domains as described in @xcite . by conveniently dividing the domain @xmath0",
    ", we obtain that almost every trajectory `` cycles '' around a point in finite time .",
    "the @xmath46-boundedness is out of reach with our method , but numerical simulations are presented in section [ sec : example ] , not only to provide expectation of cycles , but also allow to conjecture a limit cycle phenomenon for the expectation of @xmath45 .",
    "it is somewhat unclear how assumption [ ass : non - linear goodwin ] and late assumption [ ass : growth conditions ] on @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath40 , are relevant in these results .",
    "we show below thatthey are sufficient to obtain existence of regular solutions to .",
    "this actually emphasizes the role played by the entropy of the deterministic system in the well - posedness of the stochastic system and as a natural measure for perturbation .",
