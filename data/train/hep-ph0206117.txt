    "the question whether traditional leading twist qcd is the relevant description of hera small-@xmath0 data has still no clear - cut answer .",
    "a particularly successful saturation model proposed by golec - biernat and wsthoff ( gbw ) @xcite suggests that the common picture of a proton looking like a dilute set of partons might be unjustified .",
    "we have recently shown _ directly _ that the proton is a dense system already at present hera energies @xcite .",
    "the method we used is summarized in the next section .",
    "we then dedicate a section to a by - product of our analysis : the measurement of total dipole - proton cross section .",
    "wave diffraction allows to obtain a picture of a microscopic object .",
    "a fourier transform relates its density profile to the square root of the intensity of light measured on the interference pattern .",
    "it turns out that one can analyse the hera data for diffractive vector meson production in this way .",
    "indeed , at high energy , such a process is equivalent to elastic diffusion of dipoles .",
    "the picture is the following @xcite : in an appropriate reference frame , the photon of virtuality @xmath1 splits in a @xmath2 dipole which scatters elastically off the target proton before recombining into a meson .",
    "the size of the interacting dipole is distributed around a mean value @xmath3 and the total flux @xmath4 is the scalar product of photon and meson wave functions @xmath5 .",
    "the density profile is extracted by taking the fourier transform of the square root of the differential cross section @xmath6 with respect to the momentum transfer @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the variable conjugated to @xmath7 is the impact parameter of the dipole relatively to the center of the proton .",
    "one then sees that this profile is related to the @xmath9-matrix element for elastic dipole - proton scattering ( a key observation is that @xmath9 is essentially real at high energy ) .",
    "it reads @xmath10 as a phenomenological model is needed for the meson wave function @xmath11 which appears in @xmath4 , checks of model - independence of the method are in order .",
    "we checked that the dipole size is indeed distributed around a mean size @xmath12 independently of the model ( @xmath13 is the mass of the meson ) .",
    "we also verified that the dipole flux @xmath4 is strongly constrained by the well - known photon wave function @xmath14 , and thus is quite model - independent .",
    "we applied formula  ( [ eq : s ] ) to the zeus data for diffractive electroproduction of longitudinal @xmath15 mesons @xcite .",
    "as saturation is a high energy effect , we considered the lowest available values of @xmath0 ( @xmath16 ) only .",
    "we varied the virtuality @xmath1 of the photon so that the effective scale @xmath17 is always larger than @xmath18 .",
    "the result of our analysis for 3 different values of the photon virtuality is represented on fig.1 .",
    "the estimated error shown stems from the lack of data for large momentum transfer @xmath19 .",
    "it does not include experimental errors on the measured quantities .",
    "why is @xmath9 a good estimator of the importance of saturation effects ? as argued before , the value of @xmath9 tells us about how dense the proton looks .",
    "@xmath20 means blackness : it is the unitarity limit . for a more quantitative interpretation",
    ", one observes that @xmath21 is the interaction probability of a dipole that hits the proton at impact parameter @xmath22 .",
    "if this probability is significant , it means that more rescatterings are likely to occur .",
    "we see that the interaction probability is more than 50% and could already reach 75% at the center of the proton .",
    "a more common parameter characterizing the saturation regime is the saturation scale @xmath23 . roughly speaking",
    ", it is defined as the maximal virtuality for which the photon sees the proton as a dense medium .",
    "we found @xmath23 of order 1 to 1.5  @xmath24 near the center of the proton , and 0.2  @xmath24 on the periphery .",
    "we refer the interested reader to ref.@xcite for all details of the analysis and more results .",
    "having the @xmath9-matrix , one can easily obtain the total dipole - proton cross section .",
    "it is an interesting quantity because of its universality .",
    "one needs the forward differential cross section from the data and the dipole flux @xmath4 and average dipole size @xmath3 from the model .",
    "the cross section reads @xmath25 in pratice , we give an upper and a lower bound for @xmath3 .",
    "an approximate lower bound is obtained when the dipole size distribution is weighted by a flat ( saturated ) cross section ( i.e. @xmath26 ) .",
    "the upper bound comes for a colour transparent cross section @xmath27 .",
    "a realistic average value can be computed by taking an interpolating weight .",
    "we took gbw cross section , and we checked that the expectation value @xmath3 is not very much dependent on the exact point where the transition occurs , as long as it is around @xmath28 .",
    "the result is plotted on fig.[fig : stot ] .",
    "we have shown that perturbative saturation effects are already important at hera .",
    "our argument was that the proton appears quite dense to a relatively small size probe .",
    "we were able to give a quantitative estimate of its darkness by measuring the @xmath9-matrix element for elastic dipole - proton scattering .",
    "it turns out that the probability that a dipole of size @xmath29  fm undergoes an inelastic interaction is more than @xmath30 at small impact parameters , and for the high energy data from hera .",
    "this translates into a saturation scale @xmath23 lying between @xmath31 and @xmath32 which is consistent with the assumptions contained in gbw model .",
    "more exclusive data for quasi - elastic processes at large momentum transfer on one hand , and impact parameter - dependent analysis on the other hand , would be very welcome in the future since saturation effects are expected to be maximal for central collisions .",
    "+ [ _ the interesting question whether this statement is in contradiction with the successful description of vector meson photoproduction at large @xmath33 by 2-gluon exchange enhanced by bfkl corrections was raised by martin mcdermott during the discussion . from our result ,",
    "for high energies ( @xmath34 ) , low @xmath1 and large @xmath33 diffractive processes , one would expect significant saturation effects . in any case",
    ", it would be very instructive to construct a model of gbw type for large @xmath33 processes .",
