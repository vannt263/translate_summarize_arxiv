    "in dieser doktorarbeit werden modelle fr die oberflchen epitaktisch gewachsener kristalle entwickelt .",
    "i m einleitungskapitel [ einleitungskapitel ] werden die wichtigsten prozesse auf kristalloberflchen in einer fr die molekularstrahlepitaxie ( mbe ) typischen umgebung vorgestellt .",
    "i m ersten teil der arbeit ( kapitel [ dreikapitel ]  [ zinkblendenmodell ] ) prsentieren wir modelle fr die ( 001)-oberflchen der ii - vi halbleiter cdte und znse",
    ". hauptschlich beschftigen wir uns dabei mit cdte .",
    "i m zweiten teil ( kapitel [ waveletkapitel ] und [ coarsekapitel ] ) werden allgemeine eigenschaften des wachstumsprozesses untersucht , die nicht an ein spezielles material gebunden sind .",
    "dies sind das kinetische aufrauen wachsender oberflchen und das hgelwachstum .",
    "da beide effekte nur nach dem aufdampfen dicker schichten beobachtet werden knnen , mssen wir uns bei ihrer untersuchung auf einfache modelle beschrnken , die mit relativ wenig rechenaufwand simuliert werden knnen .    in kapitel [ dreikapitel ]",
    "stellen wir ein gittergasmodell fr flache cdte(001)- und znse(001)-oberflchen i m thermischen gleichgewicht vor .",
    "sowohl die anordnung der metallatome in leerstellenstrukturen als auch die dimerisierung der nichtmetallatome werden bercksichtigt",
    ". die oberflche wird durch ein zweidimensionales quadratgitter dargestellt .",
    "wir fhren anisotrope wechselwirkungen zwischen nchsten und bernchsten nachbarpltzen ein , in denen die bekannten eigenschaften der oberflche bercksichtigt werden .",
    "das phasendiagramm des modells wird mit transfermatrixrechnungen und monte carlo simulationen bestimmt .",
    "die einzelnen phasen werden mit verschiedenen experimentell untersuchten rekonstruktionen identifiziert .",
    "insbesondere kann der bergang von einer cd - terminierten @xmath0-rekonstruktion bei tiefen temperaturen zu einer ebenfalls cd - terminierten @xmath3-rekonstruktion bei hohen temperaturen , der auf cdte - oberflchen beobachtet wurde , als folge eines ordnungs - unordnungs - phasenbergangs erklrt werden .",
    "dabei spielt der kleine energieunterschied zwischen den beiden rekonstruktionen eine wesentliche rolle .",
    "kristalloberflchen in einer mbe - anlage befinden sich nicht i m thermischen gleichgewicht .",
    "stattdessen finden nichtgleichgewichtsprozesse wie wachstum und sublimation statt .",
    "bleiben die wesentlichen eigenschaften unseres gleichgewichtsmodells unter diesen bedingungen erhalten oder treten vollkommen neue effekte auf ?",
    "um diese frage zu beantworten , mssen wir unser zweidimensionales gittergas zu einem modell eines dreidimensionalen kristalls erweitern , mit dem wachstum und sublimation simuliert werden knnen .",
    "die grundlegende idee dabei ist , dass sich atome i m inneren des kristalls isotrop anziehen , whrend zwischen teilchen an der oberflche die anisotropen wechselwirkungen des gittergases wirken .",
    "ein solches modell , das i m vergleich zu einer realistischen simulation des cdte allerdings stark vereinfacht ist , betrachten wir in kapitel [ rekkapitel ] .",
    "wir vernachlssigen die dimerisierung von te - atomen an der oberflche und simulieren ein einfach kubisches gitter anstelle des zinkblendengitters des cdte .",
    "trotz dieser vereinfachungen knnen mit diesem modell viele effekte reproduziert werden , die auf sublimierenden",
    "cdte(001)-oberflchen i m vakuum und unter einem externen fluss aus reinem cd oder reinem te beobachtet wurden .",
    "weiterhin stimmt das verhalten des modells qualitativ mit dem einer vereinfachten version unseres gittergases berein , in dem die dimerisierung von te - atomen nicht bercksicht wird .",
    "damit ist gezeigt , dass die untersuchung zweidimensionaler gittergasmodelle i m thermischen gleichgewicht prinzipiell ein geeignetes werkzeug zum verstndnis rekonstruierter oberflchen unter mbe - bedingungen ist .",
    "andererseits verursachen die nichgleichgewichtsbedingungen der sublimation aber auch charakteristische abweichungen vom verhalten des gleichgewichtsmodells , die in genauen untersuchungen bercksichtigt werden sollten .",
    "ausgehend von diesem ergebnis entwickeln wir ein realittsnheres modell der cdte(001)-oberflche , das in kapitel [ zinkblendenmodell ] vorgestellt wird .",
    "wir simulieren das zinkblendengitter anstelle eines einfach kubischen gitters .",
    "die dimerisierung von te - atomen wird aber weiterhin vernachlssigt .",
    "durch wahl eines geeigneten parametersatzes knnen experimentelle ergebnisse nicht nur rein qualitativ , sondern auch grob quantitativ reproduziert werden .",
    "das deutet darauf hin , dass eine erweiterung zu einem wirklich realistischen modell mglich sein sollte , sobald geeignete experimentelle daten zur anpassung vorliegen .",
    "mit diesem modell werden simulationen der atomlagenepitaxie ( ale ) durchgefhrt .",
    "obwohl dieser prozess in technik und grundlagenforschung hufig angewendet wird , wurde er unseres wissens nach noch nie in monte carlo simulationen untersucht .",
    "wir beobachten eine wachstumsrate von einer halben monolage pro zyklus und einen wechsel zwischen rauen und glatten oberflchen in aufeinanderfolgenden zyklen .",
    "beide effekte wurden auch in experimenten beobachtet .    in kapitel [ waveletkapitel",
    "] werden die fraktalen eigenschaften kinetisch aufgerauter oberflchen untersucht .",
    "wir betrachten ein modell einer unrekonstruierten oberflche eines einfach kubischen kristalls whrend des mbe - wachstums bei niedriger temperatur .",
    "dabei entstehen selbsthnliche oberflchen , deren multifraktale spektren mit hilfe der wtmm - methode erstmals vollstndig bestimmt werden konnten .",
    "die statistischen eigenschaften wachsender oberflchen sind invariant unter der dynamischen skalentransformation .",
    "wir identifizieren den dynamischen exponenten @xmath2 mit demjenigen hlder - exponenten , der das multifraktale spektrum maximiert .",
    "dieses skalenverhalten stellt eine verallgemeinerung der aus der literatur bekannten family - vicsek - skaleninvarianz dar .",
    "allerdings messen wir eine starke abhngigkeit der skalenexponenten von der desorptionsrate , was darauf hindeutet dass diese nicht universell sind .",
    "abschlieend untersuchen wir in kapitel [ coarsekapitel ] die vergrberungsdynamik hgeliger oberflchen , wie sie whrend des wachstums entstehen , wenn die teilchendiffusion ber stufen hinweg durch eine starke schwbelbarriere unterdrckt wird .",
    "ein kontinuumsmodell dieses vorgangs , das zuerst von siegert et .",
    "untersucht wurde , sagt eine abhngigkeit der dynamischen skalenexponenten von der symmetrie der oberflche voraus .",
    "um diese vorhersage zu berprfen , simulieren wir das wachstum mit unendlich hoher schwbelbarriere auf verschiedenen gitterstrukturen .",
    "dabei wird ein effizienter simulationsalgorithmus verwendet , in dem jeweils die bewegungen eines einzelnen teilchens von der deposition bis zum erreichen eines fest gebundenen endzustands verfolgt werden .",
    "wir stellen fest , dass die skalenexponenten , anders als von der kontinuumstheorie vorhergesagt , nicht von der oberflchensymmetrie abhngen . stattdessen beobachten wir eine abhngigkeit der exponenten von der geschwindigkeit der diffusion entlang von stufenkanten . die bei starker kantendiffusion gemessenen skalenexponenten knnen mit einer einfachen abschtzung erklrt werden .    in den beiden anhngen werden",
    "die techniken , mit denen die in dieser arbeit betrachteten modelle untersucht wurden , also die transfermatrixmethode und die monte carlo simulation mit kontinuierlicher zeit , vorgestellt .",
    "in the fabrication of modern semiconductor devices like computer chips or laser diodes one frequently is interested in depositing thin films on a monocrystalline substrate .",
    "important techniques to achieve this goal are molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) and related methods @xcite .",
    "a sketch of an mbe chamber is shown in figure [ skizzembe ] .",
    "the whole process is performed in ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) to avoid the intrinsic instabilities of crystal growth in a liquid or gassy medium which result from diffusive and convective processes @xcite .",
    "material is evaporated in an effusion cell and creates an atomic or molecular beam which is directed towards the substrate .",
    "the mean free path of the particles in the beam is large compared to the distance between the effusion cell and the substrate such that the particles move on straight lines .",
    "thus , the whole surface is exposed to an even material flux .",
    "the success of mbe depends on the ability to control the physical processes which occur on the surface of the substrate itself .",
    "this might be done e.g.  by a regulation of temperature and particle flux .",
    "mbe growth leads to the formation of a rich variety of surface morphologies - to the regret of many practicians who are interested in smooth films . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", these phenomena pose a challenge to our understanding .",
    "first , the physics of crystal surfaces is determined by a complex interplay of various effects like surface reconstruction and the adsorption , diffusion and desorption of adatoms .",
    "second , a crystal under mbe conditions is in a state far from thermal equilibrium . in this case",
    ", no general theoretical framework like equilibrium statistical mechanics is available . instead",
    ", the behaviour of the system might be determined by the details of microscopic processes which occur on atomic lengthscales and short timescales of @xmath4",
    ". however , large surface formations like mounds have extensions of up to @xmath5 and their formation takes several minutes to hours .",
    "this wide range of relevant length- and timescales has inspired a variety of approaches which range from first principles methods based on quantum mechanics to macroscopic differential equations . in this thesis , we study lattice gas models which build a bridge between a purely microscopic and a purely macroscopic point of view .",
    "in contrast to differential equations , they consider the atomistic nature of matter . on the other hand ,",
    "their conceptual simplicity permits the investigation of large systems on long timescales , which is not possible by means of molecular dynamics or density functional methods .",
    "a large fraction of our work is devoted to ii - vi semiconductors , in particular cdte and znse .",
    "however , we also investigate more abstract models which aim at an understanding of general , material - independent features .    in the description of a non - equilibrium process like growth or sublimation of a crystal , two different aspects have to be considered .",
    "on the one hand , systems which are not in thermal equilibrium tend to approach to it . therefore , an understanding of the evolution of such a system requires an understanding of its equilibrium configuration . in this thesis",
    ", we present the results of models of pure surfaces , i.e.  surfaces without adsorbates . here",
    ", we have to consider surface reconstructions and the roughening transition .",
    "on the other hand , the way the system evolves depends on the kinetics of processes which occur on the surface like deposition , diffusion and desorption of atoms and molecules .      in the groundstate ,",
    "i.e.  at temperature @xmath6 , atoms in a crystal arrange in such a way that the energy of the system is minimized .",
    "this principle determines the material - specific lattice structure .",
    "atoms at the surface of the crystal have a smaller number of binding partners than atoms in the bulk .",
    "therefore , it is frequently energetically favourable if the surface atoms arrange in a structure which has a lower degree of symmetry than a planar section of the bulk",
    ". this phenomenon is called _ surface reconstruction_.",
    "reconstructions have been observed in various materials . in ii - vi semiconductors ,",
    "a variety of reconstructions consisting of vacancy structures , dimers and trimers has been found @xcite .",
    "these will be discussed in detail in chapers [ dreikapitel][zinkblendenmodell ] where we present models of reconstructed ( 001 ) surfaces of cdte and znse .    in general , a theoretical prediction whether a surface of a particular material reconstructs and which reconstructions can be found is a hard problem even at @xmath6 .",
    "it requires an investigation of the properties of the chemical bonds in the crystal . for this purpose ,",
    "molecular statics using empirical potentials @xcite and density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite have been employed .",
    "the computational burden of these methods is comparatively high , which restricts their practical applicability to systems consisting of only a few atoms . due to the periodicity of crystal surfaces",
    "this is not a severe restriction if one is interested in ground state properties .    in the case of polar semiconductors like iii - v and ii - vi compounds",
    ", there is a simple consideration which allows to _ exclude _ energetically unfavourable surface configurations @xcite .",
    "consider the electronic structure of a compound semiconductor .",
    "a schematical sketch of the energy levels in znse is shown in figure [ energielevelintro ] .",
    "other compound semiconductors like gaas and cdte show a similar behaviour . from the @xmath7- and @xmath8-orbitals of the valence electrons @xmath9 hybrids",
    "are created which have an energy @xmath10 .",
    "the energy bands of the crystal are obtained from linear combinations of these atomic orbitals .",
    "the bonding combinations yield the valence band , the antibonding ones the conduction band . at @xmath6 ,",
    "the valence band is fully occupied and the conduction band is empty .    in the bulk of the crystal , the four @xmath9 orbitals of each atom overlap with orbitals of neighbours and create chemical bonds .",
    "each bond is occupied by two electrons . due to the different electronegativities of the elements",
    "the metal atoms carry positive charge ( cations ) and the atoms of the nonmetallic elements are negatively charged ( anions ) .",
    "atoms at the surface have a smaller number of nearest neighbours such that some of their orbitals are directed out of the crystal .",
    "these are denoted as _",
    "dangling bonds_. cation dangling bonds are empty since their energy level is in the conduction band . on the contrary",
    ", the binding energy of electrons in the anion dangling bonds is below the valence band maximum such that each of these orbitals is occupied by two electrons .",
    "the total charge of each atom is the sum of its valence nuclear charge , the charge of the bonding electrons and the charge of the electrons in the dangling bonds . in general , it is nonzero .    in the majority of all conceivable arrangements of atoms in the terminating layer of the crystal",
    "there is a net charge of the surface which creates an electric field in the bulk .",
    "energetically , this is extremely unfavourable @xcite .",
    "consequently , in nature only surface reconstructions without a net charge are realized .",
    "this condition is fulfilled if the number of electrons is just sufficient to fill the chemical bonds and the anion dangling bonds . in the literature , this law is known as _ electron counting rule _ @xcite .    at higher temperature , the properties of the surface are influenced by thermodynamic effects . frequently , phase transitions between different reconstructions are observed .",
    "strictly speaking , phase transitions exist only in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , their theoretical investigation requires the study of systems with a large number of atoms which is beyond the scope of first principles methods or molecular dynamics simulations using realistic empirical potentials . in this case , effective models which neglect several details but preserve the relevant features of the atomic interactions are required .",
    "the models of cdte and znse which we present in chapters [ dreikapitel][zinkblendenmodell ] belong to this class .      in thermal equilibrium at low temperature ,",
    "surfaces of homogeneous crystals which are oriented in a high symmetry direction are essentially flat apart from the pattern of a possible reconstruction .",
    "since atoms on the surface are bound more weakly than atoms in the bulk , the system minimizes its energy by reducing the area of the surface .",
    "the most frequent thermal excitations are single atoms or small groups of atoms diffusing around on the surface and the vacancies they have left when jumping out of the terrace .",
    "the creation of a step of atomic height and length @xmath11 costs an energy @xmath12 . in good approximation ,",
    "the step energy per unit length @xmath13 is independent of temperature .",
    "since atoms at the step edge have a smaller number of binding partners than atoms which are incorporated in a terrace , @xmath13 is positive .",
    "however , at the creation of the step an entropy @xmath14 is gained since there are many step configurations with equal energy .",
    "consequently , the free energy per unit length , @xmath15 decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "@xmath16 is denoted as _ line tension of steps_. at a critical temperature @xmath17 , there is a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition @xcite . at higher temperature",
    ", we have @xmath18 .",
    "then , steps are created spontaneously by thermal fluctuations and the surface becomes rough .",
    "this phase transition is called _ roughening transition_.    a quantitative measure of the roughness of a surface is the height - height correlation function @xmath19 .",
    "consider a system of cartesian coordinates @xmath20 the @xmath21-axis of which is perpendicular to the surface .",
    "in the remainder of this thesis we will use this orientation of the coordinate system .",
    "we define the _ height _ of the surface @xmath22 as function of the vectors @xmath23 in the two - dimensional @xmath24 space which returns the @xmath21-coordinate of the surface at @xmath23 .",
    "then , @xmath19 is defined as @xmath25 below @xmath17 , one finds that @xmath19 remains finite in the limit of an infinite distance @xmath26 .",
    "this expresses the fact that the surface is essentially flat . on the contrary , at @xmath27 we have @xmath28",
    "this logarithmic divergence corresponds to a surface with strong fluctuations .",
    "usually , molecular beam epitaxy is performed at temperatures far below the roughening transition .",
    "this is also the case in the growth models which are investigated in this thesis .",
    "consequently , surfaces of homogeneous crystals in thermal equilibrium should be flat at typical mbe temperatures .      in _ heteroepitaxy _ , the deposited film consists of a different material than the substrate .",
    "if substrate and adsorbate have different lattice constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 , equilibrium configurations where the surface is not flat can be found even at low temperature . at the adsorbate - substrate interface ,",
    "the interaction of the adsorbate particles with the substrate forces the adatoms to adapt to the substrate lattice constant @xmath29 .",
    "however , the adatom - adatom interaction favours a distance @xmath30 between adsorbate particles .",
    "this induces strain in the adsorbate .",
    "the equilibrium configuration depends on the relative strength of the competing forces and the relative lattice mismatch @xmath31 .",
    "three different growth modes have been observed @xcite .",
    "if the attraction between adsorbate particles is much stronger than the adsorbate - substrate interaction and/or the lattice mismatch is large , one obtains small droplets of the adsorbate .",
    "this is called the _ volmer - weber _ growth mode .",
    "conversely , if the binding of the adsorbate atoms to the substrate is stronger than the adsorbate - adsorbate bond , small amounts of the adsorbate form a flat layer .",
    "the behaviour of a thicker adsorbate layer depends on whether the adsorbate - adsorbate interaction is strong enough to outweigh the elastic energy of the strain .",
    "if this is the case , thick layers are flat .",
    "this is the _ frank - van der merwe _ mode .",
    "otherwise , in the _ stranski - krastanov _ mode , adsorbate islands are formed on top of a thin wetting layer . in very thick films , dislocations are created .",
    "their creation costs energy , however , they permit the adsorbate to adapt to its own lattice constant @xmath30 . recently ,",
    "specialized simulation techniques have been developed which allow for the simulation of strained heteroepitaxial growth @xcite .",
    "they are computationally expensive , which restricts their practical applicability to @xmath32-dimensional models .    in the remainder of this thesis",
    "we restrict ourselves to _ homoepitaxial _ growth where substrate and adsorbate particles are identical .",
    "simulations of surfaces in an mbe environment are based on rules which describe the motion of atoms . in growth models ,",
    "the atomic nuclei are treated as classical particles the motion of which is , in principle , described by newton s laws .",
    "of course , the forces which act between the particles are determined by the electronic structure which follows quantum - mechanical laws . in",
    "_ molecular dynamics _",
    "( md ) simulations , the equation of motion of the particles is solved numerically .",
    "the forces are calculated by means of empirical potentials or dft .    in the energy landscape of a large number of atoms in phase space",
    ", there are many local minima .",
    "these correspond to configurations where the atoms arrange e.g.  in a regular crystal lattice . if the heights of the barriers between the minima are noticeably higher than @xmath33 , most of the time",
    "the actual state of the system will fluctuate around one of them .",
    "these are the thermally excited lattice vibrations of the crystal .",
    "very rarely , the system leaves a minimum and jumps into a neighbouring one .",
    "these are processes where the arrangement of atoms changes like e.g.  a diffusion jump of an adatom on the surface . in a md simulation ,",
    "the lattice vibrations are considered explicitly .",
    "this is the reason why this method is computationally extremely expensive .",
    "on modern computers , the motion of several thousand atoms can be traced for at most some nanoseconds , which is by far too short to investigate mbe .    in monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we investigate the system on a coarse grained scale",
    ". only changes of the arrangement of atoms are considered explicitly , while the chaotic motion of atoms due to lattice vibrations is considered implicitly in a statistical manner .",
    "it determines the rate @xmath34 of events where the atomic arrangement changes .",
    "one can show quite generally @xcite that for thermally excited events @xmath34 is given in good approximation by an arrhenius law @xcite @xmath35 @xmath36 is the height of the energy barrier which must be overcome to change from the initial to the final minimum .",
    "@xmath37 is an attempt frequency which is on the order of magnitude of the debye frequency of the crystal . in general",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that it is identical for all processes which occur on the surface .",
    "compared to md , the monte carlo technique reduces the computational effort by many orders of magnitude and makes it feasible to consider the typical timescales of mbe .",
    "frequently , the position of the atoms in the relevant local energy minima can be assigned to sites in a ( potentially distorted ) crystal lattice . in this case , _ lattice gas _ models are appropriate .",
    "we consider a fixed crystal lattice .",
    "each lattice site is either occupied by an atom or empty . at the deposition of an atom , the state of one site changes from empty to occupied .",
    "if an atom is desorbed , its site is switched from occupied to empty . at the diffusion of an atom ,",
    "the states of two sites are exchanged . in the presence of surface reconstructions ,",
    "the topology of the lattice at the surface might be different from that in the bulk .",
    "it is possible to extend a lattice gas model to include this effect by adding additional discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "examples are the formation of si dimers on si(001 ) in the simulations of rockett et .",
    "@xcite and the dimerization of te atoms in our model of the cdte(001 ) surface which will be presented in section [ dreikapitel ] .",
    "in addition to the application in monte carlo simulations , lattice gases and arrhenius activated processes are the basis of most theories which consider the dynamics of processes which occur at crystal surfaces .",
    "examples include nucleation theory @xcite and bcf theory @xcite .",
    "atoms impinge on the substrate with a kinetic energy @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the temperature of the effusion cell . typically , @xmath39 is higher than the substrate temperature .",
    "additional energy is gained from the formation of chemical bonds to the surface .",
    "consequently , the energy of the newly arriving particles is considerably higher than that of particles on the surface which are already thermalized at substrate temperature .",
    "this leads to an increased mobility of adatoms until the excess energy is dissipated .",
    "the particles get trapped at energetically favourable sites with high coordination number .",
    "clearly , such sites will be found preferentially in layers close to the substrate .",
    "therefore , the motion of the adatoms is biased in the `` downhill '' direction .",
    "the momentum of the particles in the beam which is directed towards the substrate enhances this bias . in the literature",
    "@xcite results of molecular dynamics simulations have been reported which confirm these qualitative considerations .    in our simulations",
    ", we consider this effect by means of effective rules termed _ incorporation _ and _ downhill funneling_. in incorporation , a particle moves to the lattice site at the lowest height within an _ incorporation radius _ @xmath40 around the position where it hits the surface @xcite .",
    "the simulations presented in @xcite suggest that reasonable values of @xmath41 should be on the order of magnitude of a few lattice constants . in downhill funneling @xcite , adatoms perform a biased random walk to nearest neighbour sites lying lower than the current site .",
    "the particle stops when the height of all neighbour sites is equal to or greater than the current height .    at the deposition of particles ,",
    "_ precursor states _ can play an important role .",
    "particles which land on the surface first enter a state where they are only weakly bound to the surface .",
    "later , a strong chemical bond is formed .",
    "meanwhile , they may diffuse over a considerable distance . in chapter [ zinkblendenmodell ] , we investigate a model where such weakly bound states play an important role .",
    "to understand the properties of diffusion , the concept of the _ potential energy surface _ ( pes ) or _ surface energy map _ is employed .",
    "it is assumed that the energy barriers at zero temperature are a reasonable approximation for the energy barriers at growth temperature .",
    "consider an atom close to a surface .",
    "we fix its position in the @xmath42- and @xmath43-direction at @xmath44 .",
    "there is no constraint in the @xmath21-coordinate of this test atom and the positions of the atoms in the crystal .",
    "we determine the equilibrium configuration at @xmath6 by minimizing the total energy with respect to these remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "measuring the total energy of the system as a function of @xmath23 , we obtain the pes of an adatom .",
    "local minima of the pes correspond to sites where adatoms are stable with respect to small perturbations e.g.  from lattice vibrations .    in the investigation of the hopping of adatoms by means of monte carlo simulations , we consider processes where atoms move between these sites .",
    "the energy barrier that a single atom must overcome to hop to a neighbouring site equals the difference between the energy of the initial configuration and the saddle point of the pes which lies between the initial and the final site .",
    "this information is sufficient to calculate the ratios between the rates of various diffusion processes which occur on the surface from the arrhenius law ( equation [ arrheniusgesetz ] ) .",
    "interactions between atoms are short - ranged .",
    "consequently , the rates of diffusion processes depend only on the local environment of the diffusing atom within a range of a few lattice constants such that it is sufficient to consider a limited number of typical configurations .    at typical mbe growth temperatures , bulk diffusion",
    "can be neglected .",
    "the dominant mechanism of material transport is _",
    "surface diffusion_. we discuss some important effects in the simplified case of the surface of a two - dimensional crystal of lennard - jones particles @xcite .",
    "this is an example of a system without surface reconstruction .",
    "its pes is shown in figure [ ljonespesintro ] . as expected",
    ", the potential energy of the test particle has local minima at lattice sites .",
    "therefore , at the deposition of atoms the crystal grows in its own lattice structure such that a lattice gas modelling of this system would be appropriate . at a step edge , where it is surrounded by a large number of neighbours",
    "an atom is bound stronger than on a flat surface .",
    "consequently , there is a high energy barrier for the detachment of an atom from the step edge .",
    "similarly , adatoms are bound to other adatoms .",
    "an adatom wich crosses a step edge from above must overcome a greater energy barrier than that for diffusion on a flat terrace .",
    "this so - called _ schwoebel effect _",
    "@xcite originates from the fact that a particle at the rim of the step has only a small number of binding partners .",
    "therefore , hopping down a step is suppressed significantly compared to terrace diffusion .",
    "the same effects are found in the physically relevant case of the surface of a three - dimensional crystal .",
    "additionally , we have to consider the diffusion of atoms along step edges . in many materials , _ step edge diffusion _ at straight steps is as fast as diffusion on a flat terrace or even faster .",
    "atoms in kinks of an edge have a high coordination number .",
    "consequently , particles get trapped at these _ kink sites_. similar to the schwoebel effect , energy barriers which suppress step edge diffusion around corners are possible .",
    "in addition to the hopping of atoms , diffusion can take place via exchange processes .",
    "an adatom pushes another atom out of the surface and occupies its site .",
    "the atom pushed out becomes an adatom at a neighbouring site . from the viewpoint of monte carlo simulations of homoepitaxy",
    "both processes are equivalent , since initial and final state of hopping and exchange diffusion are identical . however , the energy barriers and therefore the rates of both processes are different . whether diffusion occurs preferentially via hopping or exchange is material dependent .",
    "the pes of a reconstructed surface has the symmetry of the reconstruction .",
    "this may lead to strong anisotropies in the diffusion rates .",
    "in the literature , pes and diffusion barriers for various materials have been published which have been calculated by means of empirical potentials @xcite and density functional theory @xcite .",
    "however , currently no such data are available for the materials which we investigate in this thesis . therefore , in our models we will use parameterizations of energy barriers which consider the effects which have been discussed in this section .",
    "similar to diffusion , the desorption of atoms from the surface is a thermally activated process the rate of which is given by an arrhenius law .",
    "in general , the higher the coordination number of an atom , the greater is the energy barrier for desorption .",

    "the differences between the materials are represented by the numerical values of parameters . in the following , for simplicity we will loosely speak of cd and te atoms instead of `` cations '' and `` anions '' without restricting ourselves to a modelling of cdte only .",

    "this is not a severe restriction , since the removal of te atoms will uncover cd atoms in the layer below . within the limit of a model of a flat surface",

    "our model is an extension of the simplified planar lattice gas model introduced in section [ dreizwei ] to a model of a three - dimensional crystal . in this chapter",
    ", we aim at an understanding of fundamental properties of nonequilibrium crystal surfaces rather than a realistic modelling of cdte . to this end",
    ", we consider a lattice gas model of a compound `` _ ab _ '' with a cubic lattice and a comparatively simple potential energy surface .",
    "the _ a _ ( _ b _ ) atoms correspond to cd ( te ) .",
    "we impose the constraint that there are no overhangs and dislocations .",
    "this _ solid - on - solid _ condition makes is possible to describe the configuration of the crystal uniquely by a two - dimensional array @xmath308 of integers @xmath309 which denote the height of the column of atoms at @xmath42-coordinate @xmath310 and @xmath43-coordinate @xmath311 .",
    "thus , we achieve an effectively two - dimensional description of a three - dimensional crystal which reduces the complexity of our model considerably .    to model the layered structure of the cdte crystal , we assign the odd heights to _ a _ particles , and the even heights to _ b _ particles .",
    "in the following , the term monolayer ( ml ) will denote one _ ab _ layer , i.e.  the height difference between adjacent monolayers is @xmath312 .",
    "inside the bulk of the crystal , there is an attractive interaction between the particles and their nearest neighbours which is isotropic in directions parallel to the surface . while there is no difference in the interaction of _ b _ particles between the bulk and the surface , _ a _ particles on the surface interact with the anisotropic interactions of the simplified version of our lattice gas model of the cdte(001 ) surface introduced in section [ dreizwei ] .",

    "this is done by fitting an ornstein - zernike law ( equation [ ornstein ] ) to @xmath351 which is measured in the monte carlo simulations .    to check whether this method yields correct results we compare the correlation length in the @xmath43-direction @xmath383 in the 2d model with a transfer matrix calculation where @xmath383 is determined from the eigenvalues according to equation [ korrelationslaenge ] .",

    "the results are shown in figure [ rek2dverg1]b . at high temperature ,",
    "monte carlo data and results of the transfer matrix calculation agree well .",
    "clearly , in a finite system with periodic boundary conditions , the correlation length can not exceed one half of the system size .",
    "therefore , at low temperature where the transfer matrix calculations yield very large @xmath383 , the monte carlo results saturate at values close to 64 .",
    "consequently , our fitting procedure is reasonable for correlation lengths which are small compared to the system size .",
    "we find , that in the 3d model @xmath384 agrees well with an ornstein - zernike law although this is strictly valid only in thermal equilibrium .",
    "interestingly , we find values of @xmath383 which agree well with the equilibrium results of the 2d model ( figure [ rek2dverg1]b ) .",
    "since @xmath385 depends strongly on which of @xmath377 and @xmath339 is greater , we expect a different behaviour of correlations in the @xmath42-direction in the 2d and in the 3d model .",
    "indeed , this is the case .",
    "in general , correlation lengths @xmath386 in the @xmath42-direction are small .",

    "this agrees with experimental results reported in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the reconstruction order of _ a _ atoms on a vicinal surface sublimating in step flow mode does not change qualitatively compared to a planar lattice gas in thermal equilibrium .",
    "in particular , the behaviour of the short range correlations @xmath377 and @xmath339 in the 3d model is quite similar to that found in the 2d model .",
    "this shows , that the investigation of comparatively simple models like those introduced in chapter [ dreikapitel ] is an appropriate tool to get insight into the behaviour of reconstructed surfaces under mbe conditions .",
    "the nonequilibrium conditions of sublimation induce characteristic deviations of the arrangement of _ a _ atoms on the surface from the equilibrium configuration .",
    "perhaps the most important one is the absence of long range order at low @xmath131 and high @xmath375 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the behaviour of the growth model of chin and den nijs @xcite .",
    "our findings can be understood within the following picture of sublimation : there is a permanent creation and annihilation of reconstructed surface . as the terminating layer of the crystal evaporates , the layer below is uncovered and becomes the new surface . in this process , a given atom stays on the surface for a typical time @xmath390 before it is desorbed . during this time , the arrangement of the atoms evolves towards the equilibrium configuration .",
    "however , it is insufficient for a complete equilibration . therefore , there are characteristic defects in the reconstruction order of _ a _ atoms .    at low temperature and high _ a _ coverage ,",
    "there is a division of the surface in domains .",
    "most of the domain walls run in the @xmath43-direction .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the formation of such a domain wall requires only a small energy of @xmath391 per unit length .",
    "thus , there is only a comparatively small driving force which makes the domains coarse .",
    "similarly , the small energy difference between a @xmath389 order and a @xmath1 arrangement might be responsible for the high values of @xmath377 at high temperature . at small @xmath375 , both @xmath339 and @xmath377 are smaller than in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this indicates , that in the 3d model there is a higher fraction of single _ a _ atoms than in the 2d model .",
    "this may be understood from the fact that @xmath392 is not sufficient for some diffusing adatoms to meet a binding partner .    on the other hand , the good agreement between the correlation lengths in the @xmath43-direction measured in the 2d model and in the 3d model shows , that important aspects of the statistical mechanics of the lattice gas in thermal equilibrium are preserved in step flow sublimation .",
    "in this chapter , we extend the model of a binary compound with surface reconstructions presented in chapter [ rekkapitel ] to make it a more realistic model of cdte .",
    "we simulate the zinc - blende lattice of ii - vi semiconductor crystals instead of a simple cubic lattice .",
    "to be meaningful , a fully three - dimensional modelling of the cdte crystal requires a detailed understanding of the interactions of the atoms on _ all _ possible surface orientations and the correct treatment of vacancies and non - stoichiometric crystals .",
    "such a model is beyond the scope of this investigation which aims at an understanding of the behaviour of reconstructed @xmath140 surfaces .",
    "however , as we will show , a physically relevant model is not possible within the limits of the solid - on - solid condition .    to find a reasonable compromise between the complexity of a fully three - dimensional model and the limits of a strict solid - on - solid model",
    ", we permit the occupation of cd sites by te atoms and the binding of te atoms to single cd atoms _ on the surface _ , while the incorporation of point defects into the _ bulk _ of the crystal is forbidden . then we can treat those atoms which stay in the correct sublattice and have at least two chemical bonds to atoms in the layer below in a solid - on - solid manner , while the weakly bound te atoms are considered separately .",
    "first , we study the behaviour of this model in vacuum and under a flux of pure cd or pure te .",
    "in particular , we show that a reasonable choice of model parameters yields semi - quantitative agreement with experiments .",
    "then , we perform simulations of atomic layer epitaxy and compare our results with those of experimental investigations of cdte by means of this growth technique .      in this section ,",
    "we present a solid - on - solid representation of the zinc - blende lattice .",
    "a sketch of its unit cell is shown in figure [ zbeinheitszell ] .",
    "we use cartesian coordinates where the @xmath42-axis points in the @xmath141 $ ] direction , the @xmath43-axis points in the @xmath142 $ ] direction and the @xmath21-axis points in the @xmath160 $ ] direction which is perpendicular to the ( 001 ) surface .",
    "the origin of the coordinate system is at the centre of a te atom .",
    "if the zinc - blende lattice is projected onto the @xmath42-@xmath43 plane in the @xmath21-direction , the image positions of all atoms lie on a square lattice ( figure [ zbsosfig1 ] ) . measuring the lattice constant in appropriate units , the images of te atoms are at postitions @xmath393 and @xmath394 in the @xmath42-@xmath43 plane where @xmath395 .",
    "the images of cd atoms are at positions @xmath396 and @xmath397 with integer @xmath310 , @xmath311 .",
    "this square lattice is used as the basis of our solid - on - solid representation of the zinc - blende @xmath140 surface , which is described by a two - dimensional @xmath398 array @xmath308 of integers .",
    "@xmath399 is the maximal @xmath21-coordinate of the column of atoms whose images are at @xmath24 , measured in units of the spacing between a cd and a te layer . in the following , for simplicity we will loosely denote any atom whose image is at @xmath24 as `` atom at @xmath24 '' and @xmath399 as `` height of the atom at @xmath24 '' .",
    "an atom in the zinc - blende lattice may have at most 4 binding partners .",
    "since the solid - on - solid condition forbids overhangs and vacancies , each atom must have at least two bonds to atoms of the opposite species in the layer below",
    ". only atoms with exactly two bonds may be _ removed _ from the crystal without violating the solid - on - solid condition : an atom with 4 bonds is inside the bulk of the crystal .",
    "if we remove it , we create a vacancy .",
    "if we remove an atom with three bonds the atom in the layer above which is bound to it becomes an overhang .",
    "atoms with only one bond form an overhang and do not exist in a solid - on - solid model . in the following , we will denote atoms which may be removed from the surface without violating the solid - on - solid condition as _",
    "mobile_. similarly , an atom can be _ deposited _ only at a site where it has exactly two bonds .",
    "the deposition of an atom with only one bond creates an overhang .",
    "empty sites where the deposition of an atom creates three or four bonds can exist only in the presence of overhangs or vacancies , which is not the case in a solid - on - solid model . in consequence , a _ diffusion process _ where an atom is removed from one site and deposited at another can not change the number of chemical bonds in the system .    a cd atom at @xmath24 is bound to te atoms at @xmath400 in the layer below and can be bound to te atoms at @xmath401 in the layer above .",
    "the atom is mobile , if there are no bonds to te atoms in the layer above , which is the case if @xmath402 .",
    "the neighbouring cd atoms of a te atom at @xmath403 are at @xmath404 in the layer below and at @xmath405 in the layer above .",
    "thus , the condition for mobility of a te atom is @xmath406 .",
    "an atom can be deposited at a site if the solid - on - solid condition is fulfilled and the atomic species matches the character of the site . at a cd site at @xmath24 ,",
    "the solid - on - solid condition demands that @xmath407 and @xmath408 .",
    "a te site at @xmath403 can be occupied if @xmath409 and @xmath410 .",
    "the deposition of an atom at @xmath24 is performed by setting @xmath411 .",
    "similarly , setting @xmath412 removes the atom at @xmath413 .    as discussed in section [ dreikapitel ] , the positions of the atoms in _ one half - layer _ of the zinc - blende lattice lie on a square lattice .",
    "however , this is not identical to the square lattice structure of the solid - on - solid representation of the crystal lattice , as it is in the simple cubic model presented in chapter [ rekkapitel ] .",
    "the distance between nearest neighbours in the square lattice of one half - layer ( denoted as _ lateral neighbours _ in the following ) is _ twice _ the distance between neighbouring images of atoms in the projection of the whole crystal onto the @xmath42-@xmath43 plane .      due to the solid - on - solid condition , only mobile atoms may desorb .",
    "we consider the desorption of single atoms from the surface , neglecting the fact that in reality te probably desorbs as a binary molecule from the cdte surface .",
    "similarly , we consider only the adsorption of single atoms via an incorporation process ( section [ depositionintro ] ) : first , the species of the atom and the landing site are chosen randomly . then , we search for sites where the depositon of this atom is possible within an incorporation radius @xmath40 around the landing site .",
    "the atom is deposited at the lowest site which has been found in that search .",
    "if two or more sites of equal height have been found , one of these sites is chosen randomly .",
    "if no appropriate site is found , the atom is reflected .",
    "we consider an atom diffusing on a flat surface , for example a cd atom on a te terminated surface .",
    "for an atom at @xmath414 , the nearest sites that can be occupied by an atom of its species are the lateral neighbour sites at @xmath415 , where the hopping vector @xmath416 is an element of the set @xmath417 .",
    "similar to the model discussed in section [ rekkapitel ] we consider also diffusion to lateral diagonal neigbour sites , i.e.  @xmath418 .",
    "however , a particle that can perform only these diffusion hops is not able to cross a step . we discuss this for the example of the cd atom at site a in figure [ zbsosfig1 ] diffusing downhill at a step in @xmath42-direction .",
    "it is not possible to deposit the atom at either of the sites b , c and d , since the condition @xmath407 is not fulfilled there .",
    "similar considerations hold for other step orientations , diffusion uphill and for the diffusion of te atoms .",
    "thus there is an infinite schwoebel barrier in a model in which only these diffusion hops are considered .",
    "since we do not want to restrict ourselves in this special case , we introduce additional hopping vectors for diffusion . in figure [ zbsosfig1 ] ,",
    "the nearest sites to site a at the lower side of the step that can be occupied by a cd atom are e and f , which yield @xmath419 and @xmath420 .",
    "extending these considerations to different step orientations , we obtain the set @xmath421 of hopping vectors which are sufficient to permit the crossing of steps of one monolayer height difference oriented in arbitrary direction . to permit the crossing of steps higher than one monolayer",
    ", we would have to introduce additional hopping vectors .",
    "however , such high steps rarely occur in our simulations .",
    "therefore , it is a reasonable approximation to neglect diffusion accross high steps in order to reduce the complexity of the model . in summary , there are 16 hopping vectors for the diffusion of an atom . however , due to the conditions that must be fulfilled to permit the deposition of the atom at the landing site , at most 8 diffusion hops are allowed for a single mobile atom .",
    "the basic idea behind our model of the cdte@xmath140 surface is similar to that of the simple cubic crystal presented in chapter [ rekkapitel ] : besides the cd - te bond , there is an isotropic interaction between cd atoms and between te atoms on lateral nearest neighbour sites in the bulk .",
    "the interaction of te atoms on the surface is identical to that of te atoms in the bulk , i.e.  we neglect the formation of te dimers .",
    "the interaction of cd atoms , however , depends strongly on whether they are mobile or incorporated into the crystal .",
    "mobile cd atoms interact with their lateral nearest neigbours and lateral diagonal neighbours with the interactions of the lattice gas model introduced in chapter [ dreikapitel ] .",
    "there is a chemical bond between cd and te atoms on nearest neighbour sites .",
    "we assume that the total energy of these bonds is proportional to their number with an energy @xmath422 per bond .",
    "since the strength of the interaction between atoms is a quickly decreasing function of their distance , we expect this energy to be the greatest part of the total binding energy of the crystal . to remove a mobile atom from the surface , two cd - te bonds have to be broken .",
    "this yields an energy barrier @xmath423 for the desorption of an atom in addition to contributions from other , weaker interactions .",
    "as discussed in section [ zbsos ] , a diffusion process can not change the total number of nearest neighbour bonds .",
    "consequently , the strength of the cd - te bond does not influence the energy difference between the starting and the final state of the atom . in our model ,",
    "the energy barrier a diffusing adatom must overcome is a separate parameter . it is smaller than the energy required to break up its bonds",
    "thus , the rates of diffusion processes are not a function of @xmath422",
    ".      interactions with a longer range than nearest neighbour interactions are required to describe surface reconstructions and to ensure that the equilibrium surface at low temperature is flat .",
    "it is a reasonable approximation to consider only interactions between particles in the same layer . in a solid - on - solid model ,",
    "the environment of an atom in the vertical direction is always the same .",
    "therefore , interactions of longer range with atoms in this direction will be always present as long as the atom remains on the surface . in case of desorption",
    "they may be treated as an additional contribution to @xmath424 .",
    "we introduce an attractive interaction between atoms which are incorporated in the crystal , i.e.  atoms with more than two bonds .",
    "an atom interacts with its lateral nearest neighbours and the strength of the interaction is isotropic .",
    "however , we allow a different strength for the attraction between cd atoms ( @xmath425 ) and te atoms ( @xmath426 ) .",
    "we assume that the interaction between te atoms is independent on whether they are incorporated in the crystal or mobile atoms on the surface and do not consider the dimerization of surface te atoms .",
    "this simplification reduces the complexity of the model considerably .",
    "mobile cd atoms interact via the anisotropic interactions @xmath175 , @xmath176 and a hardcore repulsion between particles on lateral neighbour sites in the @xmath43-direction which were introduced in chapter [ dreikapitel ] .",

    ", there is a violation of the ergodicity condition similar to the one discussed in section [ rekmodel ] .",

    "[ zbsosfig3 ] ]    in chapter [ rekkapitel ] we introduced the diffusion of _ ab _ molecules with _",
    "b _ atoms on top to solve an analogous problem .",
    "the counterpart of this process on the zinc - blende lattice would be the diffusion of a cluster of two cd atoms and one te atom .",
    "then , the small island in figure [ zbsosfig3 ] could diffuse as a whole .",
    "however , this is not a general solution to the ergodicity problem .",
    "it is not possible to remove such a cluster from the edge of a greater te terminated island without violating the solid - on - solid condition .",
    "there is at least one additional te atom in the top layer of the island which is bound to a cd atom in the cluster .",
    "if we remove the cluster , this atom becomes an overhang .",
    "additionally , in the present form of our model it is not possible to deposit an atom on a perfectly @xmath146 reconstructed surface .",
    "there are no sites which can be occupied by a te atom without violating the solid - on - solid condition .",
    "the hardcore repulsion between mobile cd atoms in the @xmath43-direction forbids a completion of the topmost cd layer .",

    "this is explained by the formation of te trimers which arrange in rows in the @xmath42-direction .",
    "a trimer is created if a cd site on the surface is occupied by a te atom .",

    "te@xmath436 atoms are allowed on sites with a mobile cd atom ( te atoms with one bond to a cd atom ) and on sites where the deposition of a cd atom would not violate the solid - on - solid condition ( middle te atom in a trimer ) .",

    "each site may be occupied by at most one te@xmath436 atom .",

    "one of the neighbouring cd atoms can diffuse into the gap ( figure [ zbsosfig2]b ) .",
    "following rule ( 4 ) , now the te@xmath436 atom is bound to that cd atom .",
    "this process creates a site in the solid - on - solid lattice which can be occupied by a te atom . in the last step , the te@xmath436 atom diffuses to that site ( figure [ zbsosfig2]c ) following rule ( 6 ) .",
    "figure [ zbsosfig3 ] shows the coalescence of islands .",
    "the te atom on top of the small island stays temporarily in a te@xmath436 state .",
    "then , the two cd atoms can diffuse to the step edge .",
    "finally , the te atom is deposited on the site in the solid - on - solid lattice provided by the cd atoms .",
    "the assumption of noninteracting te@xmath436 atoms ( rule ( 2 ) ) is a simplification which has been introduced to make an investigation of this model computationally feasible .",
    "considering interactions between the quickly diffusing te@xmath436 atoms would lead to a considerable slowing down of the simulations .",
    "this simplification is justified if the density of te@xmath436 is so low that the probability to find a partner to interact with is small .",
    "we will show that interactions between te@xmath436 atoms should be considered to describe the behaviour of a surface under a strong flux of pure te at low temperature .",
    "a te@xmath436 atom which is bound to a cd atom has three dangling bonds . as discussed in section [ reconstintro ] , these bonds are negatively charged .",
    "it is plausible to assume that this compensates the energetically unfavourable concentration of positively charged cd dangling bonds on a pair of neighbouring cd atoms in the @xmath43-direction .",
    "this might justify rule ( 3 ) which has been introduced to make the landing of te atoms on a perfectly @xmath146 reconstructed surface possible . without rule",
    "( 3 ) , it would be impossible for a cd atom to perform a diffusion process which provides a site in the solid - on - solid lattice that can be occupied by a te atom .    in the set of hopping vectors introduced in rule ( 6 ) , we have considered diffusion to those sites which have a smaller distance to the starting site than the final sites of a diffusion process within the same sublattice .",
    "these hopping vectors permit the crossing of steps with a height of one monolayer .",
    "we have omitted the hopping vectors @xmath446 and @xmath447 , since due to the topology of the zinc - blende lattice it is never possible to deposit the atom on the final site of such a diffusion process .      in our model , we assume arrhenius rates ( equation [ arrheniusgesetz ] ) for diffusion and desorption processes . to calculate the activation energy",
    "we assume the energy of the transition state between the starting and the final configuration of the system to be equal to the greater of the energies of both configurations plus an additional barrier height .",
    "since atoms on the solid - on - solid surface are bound stronger than te@xmath436 atoms , it is reasonable to assume that the barrier height for diffusion of atoms on the solid - on - solid surface is greater than that for diffusion of te@xmath436 atoms .    ]    in our model , we use the simplest choice for the energy barriers of all processes that meets this condition .",

    "the barrier heights for the other processes are chosen such that the barriers for all moves of one particle which do not increase the energy of the system are equal and detailed balance is fulfilled for diffusion processes .",

    "this agrees qualitatively with the result that on a surface of a three - dimensional crystal which is exposed to a small cd flux @xmath478 and @xmath479 are close to the values which are measured in vacuum .",
    "however , the increase of @xmath478 under a large cd flux can not be understood within the framework of a qualitative agreement of our model with the two - dimensional lattice gas .    on the zinc - blende lattice ,",
    "cd atoms can be deposited only at sites where they are bound to two te atoms in the layer below .",
    "this implies , that the maximum possible density of mobile cd atoms on a stepped surface is smaller than 0.5 .",

    "therefore , the fact that we measure @xmath511 does not imply that there are many sites where an additional cd atom can be deposited .",
    "if the density of such sites is small , an additional cd flux can not increase @xmath207 further such that there is no reason for the mobile cd atoms on the surface to arrange preferentially in a checkerboard pattern .",
    "this might explain why the behaviour of our model deviates from experiments which show that a cd flux stabilizes the @xmath146 reconstruction at high temperature .",
    "we expect a different behaviour if the dimerization of te atoms in the terminating layer is considered . in a dimer",
    ", there is a chemical bond between two te atoms which might also be the binding partners of a cd atom in the layer above .",
    "consequently , dimers are sites where a cd atom from a particle beam can be deposited .",
    "the binding energy of a dimer stabilizes the te atoms with respect to desorption .",
    "therefore , we expect that there are dimers on a surface sublimating under vacuum at high temperature if the binding energy of dimers is large enough .",
    "such a surface is probably similar to the disordered phase of the planar lattice gas with te dimerization introduced in chapter [ dreikapitel ] ( figure [ dreifig2]e ) . under a cd flux ,",

    "the edges of the grooves are @xmath512 , @xmath513 , @xmath514 and @xmath515 facets . between the grooves , there are ridges which consist of long rows of cd atoms which are parallel to the @xmath42-direction .",
    "these rows yield the extremely large values of @xmath516 which are measured on such a surface .",
    "consequently , the increase of @xmath478 on surfaces under a strong flux of cd is induced by a facetting of the crystal surface .    at low temperature ,",

    "simulations confirm this result .",
    "conversely , the experimental ale data and equation [ zbstabil ] yield an activation energy of @xmath541 for the decay of a surface terminated by te trimers .",
    "this high value indicates that there are attractive interactions between trimers .",
    "on the other hand , there must be also repulsive interactions which stop the te coverage from becoming greater than @xmath145 .",
    "thus , a consistent description of ale growth at comparatively low temperature probably requires the introduction of anisotropic interactions between te trimers .    for completeness",
    ", we have also performed simulations of ale on a stepped surface . at a terrace width of 16 lattice constants",
    "ale growth proceeds in step flow mode .",
    "we find , that the growth rate @xmath534 is identical to that found in ale on a flat surface . however , there is no alternation between a rough and a flat surface in subsequent cycles .",
    "the deposited particles are captured by step edges and no islands are created .",
    "therefore , we find a dominance of a @xmath146 arrangement in all cd phases .      in summary , we have presented a model of growth and sublimation of cdte(001 ) which might be an important step towards a realistic model of this surface .",
    "we have introduced an efficient representation of the ( 001 ) surface of the zinc - blende lattice .",
    "on the one hand , the great advantage of a solid - on - solid model to allow for a two - dimensional representation of a three - dimensional crystal is preserved . on the other hand",
    ", it is possible to consider overhangs and atoms in the wrong sublattice as long as these are not incorporated into the crystal .",
    "the reconstructions of the cd terminated surface are considered in a way which is inspired by the ideas developed in sections [ dreikapitel ] and [ rekkapitel ] .",
    "simulations of this model show , that a physically reasonable parameter set yields a rough quantitative agreement with experiments .    to the best of our knowledge , we have performed the first simulations of atomic layer epitaxy .",
    "our results show that it is possible to investigate the influence of surface reconstructions on this important growth process by means of monte carlo simulations",
    ". additionally , a comparison of the ale growth rate as a function of temperature between simulations and experiments should be useful to fit model parameters .    however , there are still some open questions .",
    "( 1 ) what is the role of te dimers on a non - equilibrium crystal surface ? the lattice gas model of a flat cdte(001 )",
    "surface in thermal equilibrium ( chapter [ dreikapitel ] ) suggests that te dimerization might be important , in particular at low @xmath207 . as discussed in section [ zbflux ] , the dimerization of te atoms might lower the cd coverage of surfaces sublimating under vacuum at high temperature .",
    "this should lead to an increase of @xmath207 and @xmath479 and to a decrease of @xmath478 under an external cd flux .",
    "experiments indicate that the cd coverage under vacuum is indeed smaller than the values which we find in our simulations . in @xcite @xmath293",
    "has been measured at the temperature of the crossover between dominant @xmath146 and dominant @xmath147 . as discussed in section [ dreiexpcmp ] , this would correspond to a coexistence of a @xmath146 and a @xmath154 phase on the surface in vacuum .",
    "( 2 ) our model does not reproduce ale growth at a speed of one ml / cycle at low temperature . as discussed in section [ zbalekapitel ] ,",
    "an understanding of this feature requires the consideration of interactions between te trimers .",
    "experiments have shown , that trimers arrange in rows parallel to the @xmath42-direction yielding a @xmath1 reconstruction@xcite .",
    "there are no trimers on nearest neighbour sites in the @xmath43-direction which can be understood from the electron counting rule ( section [ reconstintro ] ) .",
    "this suggests a modelling by means of an attractive interaction between trimers on neighbouring sites in the @xmath42-direction and a hard repulsion between trimers on neighbouring sites in the @xmath43-direction .",
    "however , it is questionable whether the simulation of such a model is computationally feasible . since te@xmath436 atoms are comparatively weakly bound , the diffusion of te@xmath436 atoms is fast .",
    "this leads to a dramatical slowing down of the simulations if there is a high density of te@xmath436 on the surface .",
    "itoh et .",
    "@xcite faced a similar problem in the simulation of epitaxial growth of gaas(001 ) where there is a high density of weakly bound as@xmath542 molecules .",
    "they solved it by treating all as@xmath542 states as one homogeneous particle reservoir without distinguishing between different arrangements of the molecules . in our model ,",
    "a similar treatment of the te@xmath436 atoms should be possible .",
    "the basic idea is to assume that the diffusion of te@xmath436 atoms is so fast that the probability of a te@xmath436 atom to interact with a given atom on the solid - on - solid surface does not depend on its history .",
    "then , it is a reasonable approximation to assume that there is an equal density of te@xmath436 atoms above each site on the solid - on - solid surface .",
    "interactions between te@xmath436 atoms might be treated in a mean field manner by assuming that the binding energy of a te@xmath436 atom depends on the total number of te@xmath436 atoms in the reservoir .",
    "the past decade has raised much theoretical research in the subject of _ kinetic roughening _ of surfaces during growth .",
    "the investigation of this effect promises deep insight into statistical physics far from thermal equilibrium , see e.g.  @xcite for an overview . as discussed in section [ kineticroughenintro ] , this process creates surfaces which have fractal properties on lengthscales smaller than the correlation length @xmath57 .",
    "we focus on a solid - on - solid model with a simple cubic lattice structure and nearest neighbour interactions only .",
    "the surface is represented by a two - dimensional array @xmath308 of integers @xmath399 which denote the height of the column of atoms at @xmath24 .",
    "the rates of thermally activated processes are given by the arrhenius law [ arrheniusgesetz ] .",
    "energy barriers are determined by the number of bonds which must be broken to remove the particle from its initial site .",
    "atoms may diffuse to nearest neighbour sites .",
    "the rate of such a process is @xmath543 , where @xmath544 and @xmath545 are the binding energies of a particle to the substrate and to its @xmath546 nearest neighbours in the same layer .",
    "@xmath37 is the attempt frequency , and @xmath33 has its usual meaning .",
    "on each site , new particles are deposited with a rate @xmath45 .",
    "there is no incorporation process .",
    "in contrast to earlier investigations of similar models @xcite , we permit the _ desorption _ of particles from the surface with rates @xmath547 , where @xmath548 . simulations of this model are performed by means of the continuous time algorithm which is introduced in appendix [ mcappendix ] . clearly , such a simple model neglects many effects which are present in real materials . on the other hand",
    ", it captures the essential features of processes which occur on unreconstructed surfaces in the absence of a schwoebel barrier .",
    "therefore , it is adequate to obtain insight into fundamental properties of the roughening process which are not specific to a particular material .",
    "recently , arnodo et .",
    "@xcite have suggested a method for the investigation of fractal and multifractal surfaces which uses the continuous wavelet transform .",
    "this is superior to the structure function approach which has to date solely been used in the analysis of models of epitaxial growth . in this chapter ,",
    "we use the wavelet method for a precise characterization of kinetically rough surfaces .",
    "in particular , we investigate the influence of desorption on the surface morphology .",
    "we show that our model fulfils the dynamic scale invariance which was introduced in section [ introdynamicscale ] .",
    "we relate the dynamic exponents @xmath2 , @xmath549 with the static scaling properties of the multifractal surface .",
    "we conclude with some remarks on the question of universality of scaling exponents .",
    "originally , it was believed that the scaling properties of kinetically rough surfaces can be understood within the framework of family - vicsek scaling .",
    "then , the properties of the surface are invariant under the dynamic scale transformation [ dynamicscalingintro ] . on lengthscales smaller than @xmath57",
    "the surface is self - affine .",
    "its hurst exponent equals the dynamic exponent @xmath2 . under these conditions ,",
    "the scaling properties of the surface are characterized completely by the two exponents @xmath2 and @xmath550 .",
    "these are assumed to be universal , i.e.  independent of model parameters .",
    "different methods have been suggested to measure @xmath2 and @xmath549 in computer simulations .",
    "frequently , @xmath549 is measured from the increase of the surface width with time , @xmath551 ( equation [ wdynamicscaling ] ) .",
    "since @xmath2 characterizes both the static scaling properties of the surface at fixed time and the dynamic scaling properties , there are two fundamentally different approaches to determine its value .",
    "static _ approach investigates the height - height correlation function @xmath106 at fixed time @xmath92 . for small @xmath552 , from equation [ selbstaffing ]",
    "we expect it to increase @xmath553 .",
    "the _ dynamic _ approach analyzes the dependence of the _ surface width _ @xmath554 in the saturation regime on the system size @xmath122 : according to equation [ wasympdynamic ] , we have @xmath555 .",
    "an alternative method uses equation [ gdynamikscaling ] : @xmath2 and @xmath21 are chosen such that the curves of @xmath556 versus @xmath557 collapse on a unique function @xmath558 within a large range of @xmath92 and @xmath11 .    however , a careful analysis of simulation data @xcite has shown that several models of epitaxial growth show significant deviations from this simple picture .",
    "first , frequently one obtains significantly different exponents from the static and the dynamic approach .",
    "this phenomenon is commonly denoted as _",
    "anomalous scaling_. second , a powerlaw behaviour of @xmath106 for small @xmath26 does not necessarily imply that the surface is self - affine . the standard approach to test for self - affinity considers the height - height correlation functions of order @xmath559 @xmath560 which are generalizations of @xmath561 . here , @xmath93 is the reduced surface height @xmath562 . on a self - affine surface",
    "we expect @xmath563 for small @xmath11 , where @xmath564 for all @xmath559 .",
    "however , sometimes one encounters the phenomenon of _ multiscaling _ : the initial powerlaw behaviour of @xmath565 yields a hierarchy of @xmath559-dependent exponents @xmath566 .",

    "the hlder exponent characterizes _ local _ symmetry properties of the surface . in the vicinity of @xmath571",
    ", we have @xmath572.\\ ] ] thus , the hlder exponent is a local counterpart of the hurst exponent : a self - affine function with hurst exponent @xmath66 has @xmath573 everywhere .",
    "however , in the case of a _ multiaffine _ function different points @xmath23 might be characterized by different hlder exponents . in this case , the surface consists of interwoven fractal sets of points where there is one particular hlder exponent .",
    "this general case is characterized by the _ singularity spectrum _",
    "@xmath574 , which denotes the hausdorff dimension of the set of points where @xmath575 is the hlder exponent of @xmath95 .",
    "there is a deep analogy between multifractality and thermodynamics @xcite , where the hlder exponents play the role of energy , the singularity spectrum corresponds to entropy , and @xmath559 plays the role of inverse temperature .",
    "so , theoretically @xmath574 might be calculated via a legendre transform of @xmath566 : @xmath576 @xcite , a method which has been called _ structure function _",
    "( sf ) approach .",
    "however , its practical application raises fundamental difficulties : first , to obtain the complete singularity spectrum , one needs @xmath566 for positive _ and _ negative @xmath559 .",
    "but as @xmath577 might become zero , @xmath578 is in principle undefined for @xmath579 .",
    "therefore , only the left , ascending part of @xmath574 is accessible to this method . additionally , the results of the sf method can easily be corrupted by polynomial trends in @xmath580 @xcite .",
    "it might be due to these difficulties , that  to our knowledge  no attempt to determine the singularity spectrum of _ growing surfaces _ from @xmath566 has ever been made .",
    "on the basis of simulations of several simple growth models , it has been argued that the @xmath566 might collapse onto a single @xmath16 in the limit @xmath581 , which characterizes the asymptotic universality class of the model @xcite .",
    "this would imply that multiscaling is a finite size effect .",
    "however , there is no physical reason why this should be the case .",
    "a precise measurement of @xmath574 will help to test this hypothesis .    to this end , we follow the strategy suggested by arnodo et .",

    "\\label{wavetg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , a calculation of the moments of the wavelet transform of the surface yields the sf approach as a special case . to avoid its weaknesses , two major improvements are necessary .",

    "then , the wavelet is orthogonal to any polynomial of degree less than @xmath590 .",
    "this increases the range of accessible hlder exponents and improves the insensitivity to polynomial trends in @xmath580 .",
    "we introduce a two - component version of the wavelet transform @xmath592 ( \\vec{b } , a ) = \\frac{1}{a^{2 } } \\int d^{2}x \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\psi_{1}(a^{-1 } ( \\vec{x } - \\vec{b } ) ) \\\\",

    "second , the integration over @xmath601 in equation [ wavetg ] is undefined for @xmath605 , since the wavelet coefficients might become zero .",
    "the basic idea is to replace it with a discrete summation over an appropriate partition of the wavelet transform which takes on nonzero values only , but preserves the relevant information on the hlder regularity of @xmath580 . in the following ,",
    "we give a brief outline of the rather involved algorithm and refer the reader to @xcite for more details and a mathematical proof .",

    "they have a typical shape whose descending part seems to be symmetrical to the ascending part and which changes at most slightly , while the whole spectra are shifted towards smaller hlder exponents as desorption becomes more important .",

    "the hlder exponent which maximizes @xmath574 is identical to the dynamic exponent @xmath2 .",
    "there is no indication that the singularity spectra narrow with time .",
    "consequently , it is plausible that the multifractal properties of the surface are preserved in the limit of infinite time and there is no transition to family - vicsek scaling .",
    "our discussion of equation [ lokalglobalgleichgleichung ] indicates that this is the most general scaling behaviour given the following conditions are fulfilled : ( 1 ) the statistical properties of the model are invariant under the dynamic scale transformation [ dynamicscalingintro ] .",

    "this picture contains family - vicsek scaling as the special case where there is only one hlder exponent .    according to lpez @xcite , there are continuum models of epitaxial growth which exhibit anomalous scaling but not multiscaling . in particular , this is the case for the mullins equation and the lai - das sarma equation .",
    "since the singularity spectrum is the legendre transform of @xmath566 , in this case @xmath574 has a single peak at one characteristic hlder exponent which equals the exponent @xmath680 .",

    "if this should indeed be the case , it is improbable that the asymptotic scaling behaviour might ever be observed on experimentally relevant timescales of a few hours of growth .",
    "in spite of considerable efforts @xcite , see e.g.  @xcite for an overview , a thorough theoretical understanding of the coarsening process of mounded surfaces is still lacking . in this chapter",
    "we investigate the problem of growth in the presence of a strong schwoebel barrier which hinders interlayer transport . as discussed in section [ intromound ] , this leads to an instability of the flat surface . during an initial transient , _ mounds _ form on the surface which start to merge as soon as their flanks have assumed the stable slope .",
    "it is generally accepted that this asymptotic coarsening regime fulfils the dynamic scale symmetry which has been introduced in section [ introdynamicscale ] .",
    "it was first pointed out by siegert et .",
    "@xcite that lattice symmetries may play an important role in the coarsening process .",
    "these authors investigated continuum equations , using an analogy between coarsening and a phase ordering process which has recently gained popularity @xcite : areas of constant slope should correspond to domains of a constant order parameter .",

( 2 ) how does the coarsening process depend on the crystal lattice and its symmetries ? ( 3 ) do these results support a deeper analogy between coarsening and phase ordering ?      to answer these questions , we perform computer simulations of growth on ( 001 ) surfaces of the simple cubic ( sc ) lattice , the simple hexagonal lattice ( sh ) , the body - centred cubic ( bcc ) lattice and the ( 0001 ) surface of the hexagonal close packing ( hcp ) .",
    "this is done under solid - on - solid conditions , i.e.  the effects of overhangs or dislocations are neglected .",
    "then , the simple lattices can be represented by a square ( sc ) and a triangular mesh ( sh ) of integers respectively , which denote the height @xmath22 of the surface .",
    "we build the bcc ( hcp ) lattice out of two intersecting sc ( sh ) sublattices , which contain the even and the odd heights , respectively . here , an adatom in a _ stable _ configuration is bound to 4 ( 3 ) neighbours below in the other sublattice , which will be denoted as _ vertical neighbours _ in the following .",
    "particles with fewer vertical neighbours form overhangs which are forbidden by the solid - on - solid condition .",
    "this is physically reasonable , since such particles are only weakly bound and therefore these configurations will be unstable .",
    "additionally , particles may have neighbours in the _ lateral _ direction which are in the same sublattice .",
    "the investigation of the coarsening process requires a fast algorithm which allows for the simulation of the deposition of thick films on comparatively large systems .",
    "kinetical monte carlo techniques which consider the moves of many particles on the surface simultaneously are too slow for our purpose even if the efficient continuous time algorithms introduced in appendix [ mcappendix ] are used .",
    "instead , we simulate the moves of a _ single _ particle from deposition until an immobile state is reached @xcite .",
    "an adatom impinges on a randomly chosen lattice site . as discussed in section [ depositionintro ] , it is reasonable to assume that a newly deposited adatom undergoes an incorporation process . in our model",

    "on bcc and hcp this is repeated until it reaches a _",
    "stable site _ as defined above .",
    "on the simple lattices this is a site @xmath23 where all nearest neighbour sites have a height @xmath694 .",
    "then , the adatom diffuses on the surface .",
    "if the particle has no lateral neighbours , one of its neighbour sites is chosen at random .",
    "on the simple lattices , the particle moves to this site only if its height does not change , i.e.  we introduce an infinite schwoebel barrier . on the bcc or hcp lattice ,",
    "the particle is moved to the neighbour site if it is stable .",
    "this condition implies an infinite schwoebel barrier , too .",

    "the typical distance @xmath49 between neighbouring islands depends on the ratio of the adatom diffusion constant @xmath50 and the particle flux @xmath45 . in our effective single particle dynamics",

    "@xmath696 fixes the number of islands in the first layer which is identical to the initial number of mounds . in the later stages of growth , the typical terrace width is much smaller than @xmath697 and nucleation occurs only at the top terraces of the mounds .",
    "as soon as a particle has a lateral neighbour , it is bound to it .",
    "this process is irreversible in the sense that we forbid diffusion processes which reduce the number of bonds like the detachment from a step edge . in section [ epitaxintro ]",
    "we have shown that this is a reasonable approximation if the rates of these processes are much smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "however , the adatom may diffuse along the edge .",

    "this algorithm may be programmed very efficiently and is at least one order of magnitude faster than full diffusion monte carlo algorithms .",

    "this is what one expects at pyramidal mounds .",
    "on bcc and hcp , however , we obtain a more complicated pattern .",
    "figure [ coarsefig1]a shows a histogram of the slopes on hcp surfaces : due to the round shapes of the mounds , one finds a pronounced maximum of the probability density function in every direction of @xmath718 .",

    "this is possible because the rounding occurs at the base of the mounds , whereas close to the tips corners are typically sharp , cf .",
    "figure [ coarsefig2 ] .",
    "on bcc the results are equivalent , apart from the different symmetry .      in order to gain deeper insight into the coarsening process , we investigate the _ material transport _ on mesoscopic lengthscales by tracing the motion of particles on the surface . on all lattice structures ,",
    "we observe a strong uphill current at the corners of mounds which is a geometrical effect : an adatom attaching at the corner is transported over a mean distance @xmath699 , namely with equal probability along either of the two flanks of the mound .",
    "this results in a net current @xmath721 in the direction of the bisector of the angle at the corner , which is directed uphill .",
    "a simple calculation yields @xmath722 if there is a straight step edge of length @xmath723 , which is the case on the simple lattices ( figure [ coarsescurrents ] ) . here , @xmath724 is the rate at which particles attach to a step edge .",
    "@xmath725 is the angle between the two steps which meet at a corner .",
    "we have @xmath726 on surfaces with cubic symmetry and @xmath727 on hexagonal surfaces .    on the bcc and the hcp lattice however , material transport along step edges is severely restricted due to the rounded corners . there",
    ", particles diffusing along the edge are typically _ reflected_.",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the slope of the rounded corners is high .",
    "consequently , there are sites next to a step where an additional atom would have less than 4 ( on bcc ) or 3 ( on hcp ) vertical neighbours .",
    "since we consider only diffusion to stable sites , an atom can not cross such sites .    in the metastable configuration , this leads to a current towards the middle of the smooth step edges at the flanks of the mounds which have an extension @xmath728 ( figure [ coarsefig2 ] ) .",
    "this current has a non - vanishing _ uphill _",
    "component due to the schwoebel effect .",
    "on the rounded corners on the contrary , one observes a weak _ downhill _ current .",
    "this is explained by the observation of steep gradients ( figure [ coarsefig1]a ) , at which the downhill current due to funneling dominates the uphill current of the schwoebel effect . on these surfaces the stable slope",
    "at which the currents cancel is _ not _ assumed _ locally _ , but only in the _ global _ average , which results in spatial current patterns on the surface .",
    "an analogous behaviour is observed at the symmetry - breaking , merging mounds ( figures [ coarsefig1]b , [ coarsefig2]a ) . here",
    ", the smooth edges are in the proximity of the sharp corners .",
    "particles are reflected at the rounded corners , too .",
    "this yields a net current towards the sharp corners which _ compensates _ the geometrically induced uphill current exactly if the smooth edges have a length @xmath699 .",
    "this fact explains the broken symmetry of these mounds : if there is any process which transports matter towards sharp corners , this material is not completely diffusing inward as it would be the case on pyramidal mounds but is attached to the corner and makes it overgrow its neighbours .",
    "merging of mounds , however , _ is _ such a process : consider a terrace which goes around two mounds touching each other at the corners .",
    "due to its curvature , in this contact zone there is a high concentration of kink sites which make it a _ sink _ for diffusing particles .",
    "our observation that mounds merge perferentially in positions with touching corners gives strong evidence that the current which fills the gap between two mounds plays a dominant role in the process of coarsening , at least in the case of large @xmath699 where it is efficient .",
    "if this is the case , then a simple consideration yields the scaling exponents : due to step edge diffusion , adatoms are transported over a typical distance @xmath699 . if @xmath699 is noticeably greater than a few lattice constants , this is much more than the average terrace width . then , material transport via diffusion on terraces is small compared to transport via step edge diffusion and can be neglected .",
    "our investigation of the diffusion currents shows , that the current into the gap is significant on a few atomic layers in the vicinity of the contact point only . in consequence , this",
    "current is _ independent _ of the size of the mounds if the latter is much greater than @xmath699 .",
    "since the volume of the gap is proportional to @xmath729 , if @xmath73 is the typical distance between the mounds , it will take a time @xmath730 to fill it . in consequence , @xmath731 .",
    "since @xmath732 in the presence of slope selection , this yields @xmath692 .",
    "in contrast to the effects discussed in @xcite these considerations are completely independent of lattice symmetries . in @xcite a similar argument has been applied to the case of coarsening in the absence of dominant step edge diffusion processes ( `` bond energy driven coarsening '' ) , where material is transported mainly by terrace diffusion .",
    "this yields @xmath733 .",
    "the same exponent is obtained , if coarsening is exclusively due to fluctuations in the particle beam ( `` noise assisted coarsening '' ) .",
    "we expect , that these processes dominate step edge diffusion in the limit of small @xmath699 which leads to a transient from @xmath733 to @xmath692 if @xmath699 is increased .",

    "this is important as a consistency check and to eliminate systematical errors which might be intrinsic to some methods . according to equation [ wdynamicscaling ]",

    "since a single particle is counted as a top terrace , this method may be misleading if particles nucleate on terraces at the flanks of mounds .",

    "the maximum often fails due to noise effects ; one avoids this problem by calculating the averages @xmath744 .",
    "however , the choice of the correct power @xmath8 is a bit arbitrary .      to avoid these difficulties ,",
    "we propose a method which uses the continuous wavelet transform which was introduced in chapter [ waveletkapitel ] . due to the easier numerical computation ,",
    "we employ the two - component version [ wavewspec ] .",

    "clearly , at @xmath754 the wtmm lines trace the contours of the mounds . on the contrary , at the small scale @xmath755 , the search for the wtmm yields structures at the flanks of the mounds which are small compared to the mounds themselves .",
    "the positions of the wtmm lines at @xmath756 which is much greater than @xmath757 are not related to the mounds at all . on other lattice structures and at different time , we obtain similar results .",
    "consequently , @xmath757 is indeed a measure for the _ lateral _ size of the mounds . since the convolution of the surface with the wavelet @xmath758 is the gradient of the surface smoothed with the gaussian filter @xmath759 , @xmath760 is a measure for the _ height _ of the mounds . during the coarsening process",
    ", we have @xmath761 and @xmath762 .",
    "this procedure has several advantages compared to the standard methods used in the literature : ( 1 ) the detection of the wtmm leads to an efficient suppression of noise and therefore eliminates the ( noisy ) intrinsic width .",
    "( 2 ) since only the most important lengthscale is considered , the results may not be corrupted by details of the surface morphology on small lengthscales .",
    "( 3 ) appropriate wavelets are well localized both in real space and in fourier space .",
    "therefore , this analysis combines the advantages of real space techniques , like the counting of mounds , and fourier techniques , like the calculation of @xmath763 .",
    "we have tested this method on various artificial test surfaces and found a clear superiority to the standard methods , especially in the presence of noise which should make it interesting for experimental investigations .      in our simulations ,",
    "the asymptotic scaling behaviour is obtained after a long initial transient of about @xmath706 monolayers . since after this transient",
    "only a comparatively small number of mounds is left on the surface , the measurement of exponents is complicated by finite size effects : due to the periodicity of the system , there is a _ self - interaction _ of the currents on the mounds , if their size is no more small compared to the system size .",

    "the values obtained at large @xmath699 are compatible with @xmath692 .",
    "as indicated above , we explain this transient as a competition between different coarsening mechanisms . at large @xmath699",
    "the merging of mounds should proceed mainly by the step edge diffusion driven transport of material into the gap , at small @xmath699 it is dominated by noise assisted coarsening and/or bond energy driven coarsening .",
    "this competition might also explain why the exponents measured on bcc and hcp are still slightly smaller than those obtained on the simple lattices even at values of @xmath699 as large as @xmath519 , since the symmetry breaking of the mounds on these lattices halves the number of corners which are active in the coarsening process .",
    "all the simulation results reported above have been obtained in simulations with unhindered step edge diffusion . to further corroborate our ideas of the coarsening process",

    "we can proceed in two steps : in the first step , we select the site @xmath310 from which the particle starts with probability @xmath1102 .",
    "then , we select the site @xmath311 where the particle is landing with probability @xmath1103 . if the distance between site @xmath310 and site @xmath311 is @xmath1104 the particle is moved . otherwise , the event is rejected and the system remains unchanged . since the number of rejected events is small on large systems , the loss of speed can be neglected .    in our model of flat cdte(001 ) surfaces only the number of cd atoms is fixed , while the number of te dimers may change .",
    "this requires a more elaborate algorithm which uses both canonical and grand - canonical techniques .",
    "a cd atom may jump to any site which is not occupied by a cd atom .",
    "if the arrival site is occupied by a dimer , the dimer is destroyed .",
    "the removal of the cd atom at the starting site creates a pair of te atoms .",
    "we consider both the case where these te atoms dimerize immediately and the case where they remain unbound .",
    "additionally , te dimers may break up and dimers may be created on empty sites . in the following , these processes will be denoted as `` dimer flips '' . in each timestep",
    ", a random number is drawn to decide whether a cd jump with immediate formation of a dimer at the starting site , a cd jump without dimerization or a dimer flip will occur .",
    "the probabilities are proportional to the sums of the rates of the processes in each group .",
    "a @xmath1105 system contains @xmath1106 cd atoms and te dimers .",
    "thus , there are @xmath1107 dimer flip events",
    ". since there are @xmath1107 possible arrival sites for each cd atom , there are @xmath1108 cd jump events . to keep the ratio of dimer flips and cd jumps independent of the system size ,",
    "the dimer flips have been weighted with a prefactor @xmath1109 .",
    "then , one event in the selected group is perfomed . for dimer flips ,",
    "this is done with the grand - canonical algorithm while cd jumps are performed by the canonical two - step algorithm .",
    "in kinetical monte carlo simulations of processes like crystal growth , the set of events @xmath1110 which can occur in a particular state of the system and their rates @xmath1111 are determined by the physics of the investigated model . typically , this set of events includes the deposition of adatoms at the surface , diffusion of particles at the surface and desorption . in all full diffusion monte carlo simulations which are presented in this thesis",
    ", we assume that the rates of diffusion and desorption are given by the arrhenius law [ arrheniusgesetz ] .",
    "for a physically reasonable choice of the activation energies , the rates for diffusion processes fulfil the detailed balance condition [ balance ] such that a system where there is neither adsorption nor desorption will finally reach thermal equilibrium",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> in this phd thesis , we develop models of surfaces of epitaxially grown crystals . in the introductory chapter [ einleitungskapitel ] </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the most important physical processes which occur on crystal surfaces in a molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) environment . in the first part of this work ( chapters [ dreikapitel][zinkblendenmodell ] ) we model the ( 001 ) surface of the ii - vi semiconductors cdte and znse , our main focus being on cdte . in the second part ( chapters [ waveletkapitel ] and [ coarsekapitel ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> we study generic features of epitaxial growth which are not specific to one particular material . these are kinetic roughening and the formation of mounds . </S>",
    "<S> both effects can be investigated only after the deposition of a thick film on the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we must restrict ourselves to simple models which can be simulated with moderate computational effort .    in chapter [ dreikapitel ] </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a lattice gas model of flat ( 001 ) surfaces of cdte and znse in thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> both the arrangement of metal atoms in vacancy structures and the dimerization of nonmetal atoms are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the surface is represented by a two - dimensional square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce anisotropic interactions between nearest and next nearest neighbour sites which reflect the known properties of the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram of this model is determined by means of transfer matrix calculations and monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the phases of the model are identified with different reconstructions which have been observed in experiments . in particular , the transition between a cd terminated @xmath0 reconstruction at low temperature and a cd terminated @xmath1 reconstruction at high temperature which occurs on the cdte surface can be explained as an encompanying effect of an order - disorder phase transition . here , the small energy difference between both reconstructions plays an important role .    </S>",
    "<S> crystal surfaces in an mbe environment are not in thermal equilibrium . instead </S>",
    "<S> , non - equilibrium processes like growth and sublimation occur . </S>",
    "<S> are the essential features of our equilibrium model preserved under these conditions or are there completely different , nonequilibrium effects ? to answer this question , we need to extend our two - dimensional lattice gas to a model of a three - dimensional crystal which can be used to simulate growth and sublimation . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is that there is an isotropic attraction between particles in the bulk of the crystal while particles on the surface interact with the anisotropic interactions of the lattice gas .    such a model which , however , contains several simplifications compared to a realistic model of cdte , is investigated in chapter [ rekkapitel ] . </S>",
    "<S> we neglect the dimerization of surface te atoms and simulate a simple cubic lattice instead of the zinc - blende lattice of cdte . in spite of these simplifications , </S>",
    "<S> many effects which have been observed on sublimating cdte(001 ) surfaces in vacuum and under an external flux of pure cd or pure te can be reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the behaviour of this model agrees qualitatively with that of a simplified version of our lattice gas where the dimerization of te atoms is neglected . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have shown that the investigation of two - dimensional lattice gas models in thermal equilibrium is an appropriate tool to obtain insight into the behaviour of reconstructed surfaces in an mbe environment . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the non - equilibrium conditions of sublimation induce characteristic deviations from the behaviour of the equilibrium model which should be considered in precise investigations .    starting from this result </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a model of the cdte(001 ) surface which is closer to reality . </S>",
    "<S> it is introduced in section [ zinkblendenmodell ] . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate a zinc - blende lattice instead of a simple cubic lattice . </S>",
    "<S> however , we still neglect the dimerization of te atoms . </S>",
    "<S> an appropriate choice of the parameter set yields a rough quantitative agreement with experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates , that an extension towards a truly realistic model of cdte(001 ) should be possible as soon as experimental data are available which allow for an adaptation of the model . </S>",
    "<S> we perform simulations of atomic layer epitaxy ( ale ) . </S>",
    "<S> although this process is widely used in technological applications and basic research , to our knowledge it has never been investigated by means of monte carlo simulations before . </S>",
    "<S> we find a growth rate of one half monolayer per cycle and an alternation between a rough and a flat surface in subsequent cycles . </S>",
    "<S> both effects have also been observed in experiments .    in chapter </S>",
    "<S> [ waveletkapitel ] , we investigate the fractal properties of kinetically roughened surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a model of an unreconstructed surface of a simple cubic crystal during mbe growth at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this model yields self - similar , fractal surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the wtmm method to obtain the first complete singularity spectra of such surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical properties of growing surfaces are invariant under dynamic scaling . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the dynamic exponent @xmath2 with the hlder exponent which maximizes the singularity spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling behaviour is a generalization of the well - known family - vicsek scaling . </S>",
    "<S> however , we measure a strong dependency of the scaling exponents on the desorption rate which indicates that they are non - universal .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , in chapter [ coarsekapitel ] we consider the coarsening of mounded surfaces which are created during growth if the diffusion of particles across steps is suppressed by a strong schwoebel barrier . a continuum model of this process which was studied first by siegert et .  </S>",
    "<S> al .  predicts a dependency of the dynamic exponents on the symmetry of the surface . to test this prediction </S>",
    "<S> , we simulate growth in the presence of an infinite schwoebel barrier on different lattice structures . </S>",
    "<S> we use an efficient simulation algorithm which traces the motion of a single particle from deposition until it has reached a state where it is strongly bound . </S>",
    "<S> we find , contrary to the results of the continuum theory , that the scaling exponents are independent of the surface symmetry . instead , the exponents depend on the speed of the diffusion of particles along step edges . </S>",
    "<S> the exponents which are measured in the limit of strong step edge diffusion can be explained by means of a simple consideration .    in the two appendices we explain the techniques which we have used to investigate the models which are considered in this thesis . </S>",
    "<S> these are the transfer matrix method and continuous time monte carlo simulations . </S>"
