    "the impossibility of reproducing all correlations observed in composite quantum systems using models _ ` a la _ einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr )  @xcite was proven in 1964 by bell . in his seminal work",
    "@xcite , bell showed that all local models satisfy some conditions , the so - called bell inequalities , but there are measurements on quantum states that violate a bell inequality .",
    "therefore , we say that quantum mechanics is nonlocal @xcite",
    ". experimental verification of bell inequality violation closed the epr debate , up to some technical loopholes  @xcite .    from an operational point of view",
    "it is not difficult to define when a quantum state exhibits nonclassical correlations .",
    "suppose that two parties , alice ( a ) and bob ( b ) , share a mixed quantum state @xmath5 with support on @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the local hilbert space of a s ( b s ) system .",
    "then @xmath5 contains quantum correlations when its preparation requires a nonlocal quantum resource .",
    "conversely , a quantum state is classically correlated , or separable , when it can be prepared using only local quantum operations and classical communication ( locc ) . from this definition , due to werner @xcite",
    ", it follows that a quantum state @xmath5 is separable if it can be expressed as a mixture of product states , @xmath9 .",
    "a state that can not be written in this form has quantum correlations and is termed entangled .",
    "but the above definition , in spite of its clear physical meaning , is somewhat impractical .",
    "tests to distinguish separable from entangled states are complicated  @xcite , except when @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 and @xmath13 denoting the dimensions of the local subsystems .",
    "violation of a bell inequality by a quantum state is , in many situations , a witness of useful correlations  @xcite .",
    "in particular , bell inequality violation is a witness of a quantum state s entanglement .",
    "now , the question is : are all entangled states nonlocal ? for the case of pure states ,",
    "the answer is yes  @xcite : all entangled pure states violate the chsh inequality @xcite . in 1989 , werner showed that the previous result can not be generalized to mixed states  @xcite .",
    "he introduced what are now called werner states , and gave a local hidden variables ( lhv ) model for measurement outcomes for some entangled states in this family @xcite .",
    "although the construction only worked for projective measurements , his result has since been extended to general measurements  @xcite .    in spite of these partial results , it is in general extremely difficult to determine whether an entangled state has a local model or not  @xcite , since ( i ) finding all bell inequalities is a computationally hard problem @xcite and ( ii ) the number of possible measurement is unbounded ( see however @xcite for recent progress ) .",
    "this question remains unanswered even in the simplest case of werner states of two qubits .",
    "these are mixtures of the singlet @xmath14 with white noise of the form @xmath15 it is known that werner states are separable iff @xmath16 , admit a lhv model for all measurements for @xmath17  @xcite , admit a lhv for projective measurements for @xmath18  @xcite and violate the chsh inequality for @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ summary ] ) .",
    "however , the critical value of @xmath20 , denoted @xmath21 , at which two - qubit werner states cease to be nonlocal under projective measurements is unknown .",
    "this question is particularly relevant from an experimental point of view , since @xmath21 specifies the amount of noise the singlet tolerates before losing its nonlocal properties .    .",
    "werner s local model works up to @xmath22 , while the chsh inequality is violated when @xmath23 . here",
    ", we prove the existence of a local model for projective measurements when @xmath24.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    in this paper , we exploit the connection between correlation bell inequalities and grothendieck s constant  @xcite , first noticed by tsirelson  @xcite , to prove the existence of a local model for several noisy entangled states . we first demonstrate that @xmath21 is related to a generalization of this constant , namely , @xmath25 , where @xmath2 is grothendieck s constant of order 3  @xcite .",
    "the exact value of @xmath2 is unknown , but known bounds establish that @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we close more than three - quarters of the gap between werner s result and the known region of bell inequality violation ( see fig . [ summary ] ) .",
    "next , we show that if alice ( or bob ) is restricted to make measurements in a plane of the poincar sphere , then there is an explicit lhv model for all @xmath27 .",
    "this improves on the bound of larsson , who constructed a lhv model for planar measurements for @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the case of planar projective measurements , violation of the chsh inequality completely characterizes the nonlocality of two - qubit werner states .    in the case of _ traceless two - outcome _ observables",
    ", we can extend our results to mixtures of an arbitrary state @xmath5 on @xmath29 with the identity , of the form @xcite @xmath30 denote by @xmath31 the maximum value of @xmath20 for which there exists a lhv model for the joint correlation of traceless two - outcome observables on @xmath32 , and define @xmath33 then @xmath34 where @xmath35 is grothendieck s constant .",
    "again , the exact value of @xmath35 is unknown , but known bounds imply @xmath36 .",
    "finally , we discuss the opposite question of finding bell inequalities better than the chsh inequality at detecting the nonlocality of @xmath37 , or , more generally , of bell diagonal states  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show that none of the @xmath38 bell inequalities introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is better than the chsh inequality for these states .    before proving our results ,",
    "we require some notation .",
    "we write a two - outcome measurement by alice ( resp .",
    "bob ) as @xmath39 ( resp .",
    "@xmath40 ) , where the projectors @xmath41 correspond to measurement outcomes @xmath42 .",
    "we define the _ observable _ corresponding to alice s ( bob s ) measurement as @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "an observable @xmath45 is _ traceless _ if @xmath46 , or equivalently @xmath47 .",
    "the _ joint correlation _ of alice and bob s measurement results , denoted @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively , is @xmath50 alice s _ local marginal _ is specified by @xmath51 , and similarly for bob .",
    "together , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 define the full probability distribution for two - outcome measurements on @xmath55 .",
    "a lhv model for the full probability distribution is one that gives the same values @xmath52 , @xmath56 and @xmath54 as quantum theory .",
    "a lhv model for the joint correlation is one that gives the same joint correlation @xmath57 , but not necessarily the correct marginals . in the qubit case ,",
    "the projective measurements applied by the parties are specified by the direction of their stern - gerlach apparatuses , given by normalized three - dimensional real vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 : @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "let us first consider the case of werner states ( [ wstates ] ) . for projective measurements on @xmath62 , lhv simulation of the joint correlation is sufficient to reproduce the full probability distribution .",
    "this follows from :    * lemma  1 * : suppose that there is a lhv model @xmath63 that gives joint correlation @xmath64 .",
    "then there is a lhv model @xmath65 with the same joint correlation and uniform marginals : @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "_ proof _ : let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be the outputs generated by the lhv @xmath63 ( dependent on the hidden variables and measurement choices ) . define a new lhv @xmath65 by augmenting the hidden variables of @xmath63 with an additional random bit @xmath68 . in @xmath65 , alice outputs @xmath69 and bob @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71    therefore , the analysis of the non - local properties of werner states under projective measurements can be restricted to bell inequalities involving only the joint correlation . actually , this holds for any bell diagonal state , under projective measurements , since @xmath72 for all these states , so all projective measurements give uniform marginals . in the bell",
    "scenarios we consider , alice and bob each choose from @xmath73 observables , specified by @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we can write a generic correlation bell inequality as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a @xmath78 matrix of real coefficients defining the bell inequality .",
    "the matrix @xmath79 is normalized such that the local bound is achieved by a deterministic local model , i.e. , @xmath80 for the singlet state @xmath81 .",
    "we obtain the maximum ratio of bell inequality violation for the singlet state , denoted @xmath82 , by maximizing over normalized bell inequalities , and taking the limit as the number of settings goes to infinity : @xmath83 since all joint correlations vanish for the maximally - mixed state , it follows that the critical point at which two - qubit werner states do not violate any bell inequality is @xmath84 .",
    "as first noticed by tsirelson , the previous formulation of the bell inequality problem is closely related to the definition of grothendieck s inequality and grothendieck s constant , @xmath35 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "grothendieck s inequality first arose in banach space theory , particularly in the theory of @xmath20-summing operators  @xcite .",
    "we shall need a refinement of his constant , which can be defined as follows  @xcite :    * definition 1 : * for any integer @xmath85 , grothendieck s constant of order @xmath86 , denoted @xmath87 , is the smallest number with the following property : let @xmath79 be any @xmath88 matrix for which @xmath89 for all real numbers @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath91 in @xmath92 .",
    "* definition 2 : * grothendieck s constant is defined as @xmath93 the best bounds currently known for @xmath35 are @xmath94  @xcite .",
    "the lower bound is due to reeds and , independently , davies  @xcite , while the upper bound is due to krivine  @xcite .",
    "it follows immediately from the first definition that the maximal bell violation for the singlet state ( [ singlviol ] ) is @xmath2 .",
    "we have therefore proved * theorem 1 : * [ theorem : result ] there is a lhv model for projective measurements on the werner state @xmath37 if and only if @xmath95 .",
    "it is known that @xmath96 .",
    "the lower bound follows from the chsh inequality ; the upper bound is again due to krivine  @xcite .",
    "he shows that @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the unique solution of @xmath99 in the interval @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "numerically we find that @xmath101 .",
    "this implies @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that an explicit lhv model emerges from krivine s upper bound on @xmath2 , and the details are presented in  @xcite .",
    "another result follows from krivine s work :    * theorem 2 : * if alice s projective measurements are restricted to a plane in the poincar sphere , then there is a lhv model for @xmath37 if and only if @xmath104 .",
    "_ proof : _ in this case , the vectors @xmath105 in ( [ singlviol ] ) are two - dimensional . since the quantum correlation depends only on the projection of @xmath106 onto @xmath105 , we can assume that the vectors @xmath106 lie in the same plane .",
    "it follows that @xmath107 for planar measurements , and krivine has shown that @xmath108 is equal to @xmath109  @xcite .",
    "@xmath71 again krivine s proof can be adapted to give an explicit lhv model for planar measurements , valid for @xmath110  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to extend these results to general states of the form ( [ genst ] ) , if we restrict our analysis to correlation bell inequalities of _ traceless _ two - outcome observables .",
    "admittedly , this analysis is far from sufficient .",
    "indeed it does not allow us to determine whether the full probability distribution admits a lhv model even in the case of two - outcome measurements , since the most general bell inequalities have terms that depend on marginal probabilities @xcite .",
    "mindful of this caveat , we now prove the existence of lhv models for the joint correlation of the states ( [ genst ] ) . to make the connection with grothendieck s constant , we start with a representation of quantum correlations as dot products , first noted by tsirelson  @xcite .",
    "it is sufficient to restrict to the case of pure states , since we can obtain a lhv for a mixed state @xmath5 by decomposing it into a convex sum of pure states , and taking a convex combination of the lhv s for those pure states .",
    "* lemma  2 * : suppose alice and bob measure observables @xmath45 and @xmath111 on a pure quantum state @xmath112 .",
    "then we can associate a real unit vector @xmath113 with @xmath45 ( independent of @xmath114 ) , and a real unit vector @xmath115 with @xmath111 ( independent of @xmath45 ) such that @xmath116 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath117 is maximally entangled , then we can assume the vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 lie in @xmath118 .",
    "_ proof _ : let @xmath119 and @xmath120",
    ". then @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "denote the components of @xmath123 as @xmath124 where @xmath125 , and similarly for @xmath126 .",

    "then @xmath142 and @xmath143 ( because @xmath144 is real ) .",

    "we calculate @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the transpose of @xmath111 .",
    "introduce a @xmath148dimensional basis @xmath149 for traceless operators on @xmath150 , normalized such that @xmath151 .",
    "let @xmath152 , @xmath153 , which define the vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "squaring these definitions and taking the trace gives @xmath154 .",
    "finally , @xmath155 , which implies that @xmath156 .",
    "the converse of lemma  2 is also true : all dot products of normalized vectors , @xmath157 , are realized as observables on @xmath158 , where @xmath159 .",
    "this result was derived by tsirelson in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the sake of completeness , we state it here without proof ( see @xcite for the details ) .",
    "* theorem 3 @xcite : * let @xmath160 and @xmath161 be sets of unit vectors in @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath162 and @xmath163 be a maximally entangled state on @xmath164",
    ". then there are observables @xmath165 and @xmath166 on @xmath167 such that @xmath168 for all @xmath169 .",
    "note that in our case , the stipulation that the observables be traceless ensures that their outcomes are random on the maximally mixed state .",
    "it follows from lemma  2 and theorem  3 that    * theorem 4 : * let @xmath5 be a state on @xmath29 and define @xmath32 and @xmath170 as in eqs .",
    "( [ genst],[critpr ] ) .",
    "then @xmath171 in other words , there is always a lhv model for the joint correlation of traceless two - outcome observables on @xmath32 for @xmath172 and there is a state ( in fact , the maximally entangled state on @xmath173 qubits ) such that the joint correlation is nonlocal for @xmath174 .",
    "* corollary 1 : * the threshold noise for the joint correlation of two - outcome traceless observables is @xmath34 .",

    "the known bounds imply @xmath176 .",
    "compare this to @xmath177 , the threshold noise at which the state @xmath32 is guaranteed separable : while @xmath177 decreases with dimension at least as @xmath178 @xcite , @xmath179 approaches a constant . in the case of two - qubit systems",
    ", we can be more specific , because projective measurements are traceless and have two outcomes : * corollary 2 : * suppose @xmath5 is an arbitrary state on @xmath180 .",
    "then there is a lhv model for the joint correlation on @xmath181 for @xmath182 . in particular , @xmath183 @xcite , which implies there is a lhv model for @xmath184 . for",
    "maximally entangled states , marginals of traceless observables are uniform , so lemmas  1 and 2 imply :    * theorem 5 * : let @xmath185 where @xmath186 is a maximally entangled state in @xmath29 . then there is a lhv for the full probability distribution arising from traceless observables for @xmath187 .",
    "just as upper bounds on @xmath87 yield lhv models , lower bounds yield bell inequalities .",
    "the case of werner states appears of particular interest : at present , there is no bell inequality better than chsh at detecting the nonlocality of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "this and other approaches to construct new bell inequalities will be presented in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , none of these inequalities could be proven to be better than chsh .",
    "it is remarkable how difficult it is to enlarge this region of bell violation or , equivalently , to show that @xmath188 . actually , in the case of random marginal probabilities , as for bell diagonal states under projective measurements , no improvement over the chsh inequality can be obtained using @xmath189 measurements @xcite .",
    "a similar result can also be proven for the whole family of the so - called @xmath38 @xcite bell inequalities .",
    "these are specified by a matrix of zeros and @xmath42 as follows , @xmath190 all the coefficients in the first column ( row ) refer to alice s ( bob s ) marginal probabilities , while the rest of terms are for joint probabilities .",
    "only one of the two possible outcomes , say @xmath191 , appears in the inequality and its local bound is always zero .",
    "for example , when @xmath192 , and denoting @xmath193 , @xmath194 reads @xmath195 which is equivalent to the chsh inequality .",
    "* theorem 6 : * consider the set of @xmath38 bell inequalities , for @xmath86 two - outcome settings . then , if a bell diagonal state violates any of these inequalities with projective measurements , it also violates the chsh inequality . _",
    "proof : _ our proof takes advantage of the fact that all marginal probabilities for projective measurements on bell diagonal states are fully random .",
    "thus , when dealing with these states , one can put all the terms in the first row and column of ( [ inn22 ] ) equal to @xmath196 . in order to avoid confusion ,",
    "we denote by @xmath197 the @xmath38 inequalities where the local terms have been replaced by 1/2 .",
    "we start our proof with the simplest non - trivial case @xmath198 . for bell",
    "diagonal states , it can be written as @xmath199 where the arguments of @xmath200 are the measurements that appear in the @xmath201 inequality , @xmath202 and @xmath203 for alice , and @xmath204 and @xmath205 for bob . from this identity",
    "we have that the violation of @xmath206 implies that at least one of the @xmath201 inequalities is violated too .",
    "this procedure can be generalized for all @xmath86 : the idea is to express @xmath197 in terms of @xmath201 inequalities using the joint probability terms with a negative sign in ( [ inn22 ] ) .",

    ". thus , whenever @xmath210 , at least one of the @xmath201 inequalities appearing in ( [ i4bd ] ) is violated . for arbitrary @xmath86 , @xmath197 can always be written as @xmath211\\leq 0 , \\ ] ] i.e. the sum of @xmath212 @xmath201 inequalities and @xmath213 negative terms @xmath214 , up to an @xmath215 factor .",
    "some patient calculation shows that @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "thus , if a bell diagonal state violates @xmath38 , it also violates a chsh inequality .",
    "consequently , none of these inequalities enlarge the known region of bell violation for werner states .    after seeing these results",
    ", one would be tempted to conjecture that the chsh violation provides a necessary and sufficient condition for detecting the nonlocality of bell diagonal states , and in particular of werner states .",
    "this result , however , would imply that @xmath218 , which seems unlikely . actually , one can find in @xcite an explicit construction with 20 settings showing that @xmath219 .",
    "more recently , one of us has shown that @xmath220 as well  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have exploited the connection between bell correlation inequalities and grothendieck s constants to prove the existence of lhv models for several noisy entangled states . in the case of werner states",
    ", one can demonstrate the existence of a local model for projective measurements up to @xmath221 , close to the known region of bell violation .",
