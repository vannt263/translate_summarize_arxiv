    "nonlinear resonance is a problem with long history in quantum and classical mechanics , going back to laplace and poincare on the classical side and to the fermi resonance on the quantum side @xcite .",
    "it occurs in a broad range of systems , from celestial bodies to ecological systems to molecules @xcite .",
    "recently nonlinear resonance has attracted particular interest in the context of nano - and micromechanical vibrational systems @xcite as well as the microwave cavities used in quantum information .",
    "these systems provide an unprecedented access not just to studying this complicated phenomenon , but also to controlling and using it .    in conservative classical systems",
    ", nonlinear resonance leads to the onset of nonlinear vibrations accompanied by energy oscillations between the resonating modes .",
    "this is reminiscent of linear resonance between two harmonic oscillators .",
    "however , on a finer scale , the picture is more complicated , extending to dynamical chaos . on the quantum side ,",
    "nonlinear resonance is in some sense simpler in the absence of dissipation , as it leads to the standard level repulsion .",
    "the quantum situation changes if the resonating modes are dissipative .",
    "if the modes have very different decay rates , one of them can serve as a thermal reservoir for another @xcite . this effect has attracted much attention in cavity optomechanics @xcite and has been recently used to drive a slowly decaying microwave cavity mode to a coherent quantum state @xcite . however ,",
    "this behavior can change dramatically when the mode nonlinearity is significant @xcite .",
    "an important advantageous feature of mesoscopic oscillators is the possibility to tune the modes in and out of nonlinear resonance .",
    "this can be done statically , by directly controlling the mode frequencies @xcite , and also dynamically , by taking advantage of the dependence of the mode eigenfrequency on the vibration amplitude . by driving a mode close to its eigenfrequency , and thus increasing its vibration amplitude",
    ", one can bring its overtone in resonance with an overtone of another mode .",
    "this second mode is then excited , too .",
    "the backaction from this excitation can significantly change the dynamical response of the driven mode . in this paper",
    "we develop a theory of weakly damped vibrational modes brought into nonlinear resonance .",
    "a specific feature of the nonlinear resonance is that both the strength of the nonlinear coupling and the mode frequencies depend on the modal amplitudes .",
    "therefore a fast decaying mode can be an efficient thermal reservoir for another mode in one range of the amplitudes , but not in the other .",
    "one can then expect a strongly non - exponential decay of the slower - decaying mode . on the other hand ,",
    "if in a certain amplitude range the decay is weaker than the coupling in the appropriate units , the dynamics corresponds to resonant inter - mode energy oscillations .",
    "however , as the amplitudes decay , the scaled coupling can become weaker than the decay , eliminating the oscillations .",
    "the damping of mesoscopic modes is usually weak , the decay rate is small compared to the mode frequencies .",
    "such modes can be efficiently excited by a comparatively weak driving if it is resonant .",
    "this is advantageous , as it allows keeping the leading terms responsible for the resonant behavior while eliminating irrelevant variables .",
    "respectively , we will describe the dynamics of the coupled modes in the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "our study aims at addressing two problems : the decay of modes that go through nonlinear resonance and the response of the modes to a resonant field .",
    "we will concentrate on the limiting cases .",
    "the general analysis can be only done numerically .",
    "extensive numerical simulations have been done in parallel with this paper , along with the experimental studies simultaneously and independently by two groups @xcite .    to be specific",
    ", we will consider the modes with frequency ratio close to 1:3 .",
    "in many nano- and micromechanical systems the coupling between such modes is comparatively strong ; for symmetry reasons , it is often stronger than the coupling between the modes close to 1:2 resonance .",
    "the onset of 1:3 nonlinear resonance in a micromechanical system , which is similar to the one we use here , was inferred previously from indirect data , but the related nonlinear dynamics was not explored @xcite .",
    "the work @xcite also refers to 1:3 resonance .",
    "one of the specific limiting cases we will address are the case where one of the modes has a much higher decay rate than the other . in this case the dynamics can be described in the adiabatic approximation , in which the fast decaying mode follows the evolution of the slowly decaying mode adiabatically .",
    "this leads to an anomalous nonlinear friction for the slowly decaying mode .",
    "along with the nonlinear friction there arises a change of the effective vibration frequency of the slowly decaying mode , that displays a pronounced and strongly nonmonotonic dependence on the vibration amplitude .",
    "this is the adiabatic analog of the nonlinear frequency anticrossing .",
    "the other specific case is the case where the decay rates of the both modes are small compared to the appropriately scaled nonlinear mode coupling and possibly to the nonlinear shift of the mode frequencies compared to the small - amplitude eigenfrequency values . in this case",
    "the dynamics in the absence of the drive and dissipation is fully integrable , in the rwa . in the rotating frame",
    ", it maps onto vibrations of a  pendulum .",
    "\" we will describe the effect of weak dissipation and a weak field , which in this case can lead to the onset of limit cycles in the rotating frame , with the amplitude determined by the competition between energy drain due to the dissipation and the energy gain from the field .",
    "to explore the driving - tuned nonlinear resonance it suffices to study two coupled modes .",
    "the modes can be described by the simplest model that displays the amplitude dependence of the vibration frequency , the duffing oscillator . in the absence of coupling to the environment that leads to dissipation and fluctuations",

    "the driving - induced tuning occurs because the frequency of the mode 1 depends on its amplitude , @xmath15 , where the bar means averaging over the vibration period .",

    "the dynamics of coupled modes becomes particularly simple if mode 2 decays much faster than mode 1 , @xmath35 .",
    "physically , mode 2 can serve as a thermal reservoir for mode 1 .",
    "this  reservoir \" has two important features .",
    "first , it has a finite bandwidth . in the considered 1:3 resonance ,",
    "the reservoir is efficient if the vibration frequency of mode 1 is close to @xmath21 .",
    "second , the coupling to the reservoir is nonlinear in the mode-1 coordinate",
    ". therefore one may expect that the resulting dissipation rate will depend on the amplitude of mode 1 .",
    "if the appropriately weighted mode coupling is small compared to @xmath30 and @xmath35 , mode 2 follows mode 1 adiabatically .",
    "the restriction on the coupling is the analog of the familiar condition of a weak coupling to a thermal reservoir . because of that",
    ", the vibration amplitude of mode 2 is comparatively small .",
    "one can then disregard the internal duffing nonlinearity of mode 2 , i.e. , to set @xmath6 equal to zero in eq .",

    "one can understand the mode - coupling induced relaxation in terms of the transitions into a thermal reservoir mimicked by mode 2 .",

    "resonant driving in this case leads to coexistence of several stable states of forced vibrations .",
    "the switching between the branches of the stable states with varying parameters of the drive has a peculiar pattern , where some branches can be reached by varying only the drive strength , but not the frequency , for example .",
    "the analysis indicates that the stable states correspond to vibrations with time - independent amplitudes .",
    "in contrast , if the decay rates of the modes are small compared to the nonlinearity , in the absence of the drive the dynamics in the rotating frame can be mapped onto a pendulum . with weak dissipation and weak drive",
    ", the stable states correspond to nonsinusoidal oscillations of the amplitude .",
    "the decay of the vibration amplitude after the drive is switched off is also profoundly nonexponential and can be accompanied by oscillations of the amplitude .",
    "it is described in terms of the decay of the effective quasi - energy and the manley - rowe invariant .",
