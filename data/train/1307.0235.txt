    "since the black - scholes models rely on stochastic differential equations , option pricing rapidly became an attractive topic for specialists in the theory of probability and stochastic methods were developed first for practical applications , along with analytical closed formulas .",
    "but soon , with the rapidly growing complexity of the financial products , other numerical solutions became attractive [ 1,2,6,12,15 - 19 ] .",
    "there is a large and ever - going number of different interest rate derivative products now , for instance bonds , bonds options , interest rate caps , swap options , etc .",
    "bonds in general carry coupons , but there also exists a special kind of bond without coupons which is called zero coupon bond ( zcb ) . a zcb is purchased today a certain price , while at maturity the bond is redeemed for a fixed price . by a similar way to the derivation of the black - sholes equation , the problem of zcb pricing can be reduced to a partial differential equation ( see [ 5,13 ] ) .    the present paper deals with a degenerate parabolic equation of zero - coupon bond pricing [ 5,13 ] . since our equation ( see ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) ) in the next section becomes _ degenerate _ at the boundary of the domain , classical finite difference methods may fail to give accurate approximations near the boundary .",
    "an effective method that resolves the singularity is proposed by s. wang @xcite for the black - sholes equation .",
    "the method is based on a finite volume formulation of the problem coupled with a fitted local approximation to the solution and an implicit time - stepping technique .",
    "the local approximation is determined by a set of two - point boundary value problems defined on the element edges .",
    "this fitting technique is based on the idea proposed by allen and southwell [ 8,10 ] for convection - diffusion equations and has been extended to one and multidimensional problems by several authors [ 7,8,10 ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our model problem is presented in section 2 , where we discuss our basic assumptions and some properties of the solution .",
    "the discretization method is developed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the time discretization .",
    "we show that the system matrix is a @xmath0-matrix , so that the discretization is monotone . in this case",
    "the maximum principle is satisfied and thus the discrete solution is non - negative .",
    "numerical experiments show higher accuracy of our scheme in comparison with other known scheme near the degeneracy .",
    "we observe and emphasize the fact that in the proposed method , we do not need to refine the mesh near the boundary ( degeneration ) .",
    "suppose that the short term _ interest rate , the spot rate , _ follows a random walk @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the brownian motion . since the _ spot rate _ , in practice , is never greater than a certain number , which is assumed @xmath3 , and never less than or equal to zero , we suppose that @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "@xmath5 is a lipschitz function , which satisfies    @xmath6    @xmath7 is a non - negative and smooth bounded function , which satisfies    @xmath8    by the well - known delta hedging technique , the zcb premium @xmath9 satisfies the following backward parabolic equation ( see [ 13 ] ) : @xmath10 \\times [ 0,t),\\ ] ] @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the _ maturity _ , @xmath13 is a fixed constant .",
    "function @xmath14 in ( [ 3 ] ) is called the _ market price risk . _ for the given functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the problem of zcb pricing consists of the determination of the solution @xmath18 from equation ( [ 3 ] ) , which is often referred to as a direct problem .",
    "being different from the classical parabolic equations in which the principal coefficient is assumed to be _ strictly positive _ , the parabolic equation ( [ 3 ] ) belongs to the second order differential equations with non - negative characteristic form .",
    "the main character of such kinds of equations is _ degeneracy . _",
    "it can be easily seen that at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , equation ( [ 3 ] ) degenerates into a hyperbolic equation with positive and negative characteristics respectively @xmath21 @xmath22    by the fichera s theory ( see [ 9 ] ) for degenerate parabolic equations , we have that at the degenerate boundaries @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the boundary conditions should not be given .",
    "therefore , the maturity data @xmath23 determines the solution @xmath18 of problem ( [ 3 ] ) , ( [ 4 ] ) _ uniquely_.    first , we make the change of variable @xmath24 and let @xmath25 .",
    "then , coming back to @xmath26 , the function @xmath27 satisfies the following parabolic equation @xmath28 with initial condition @xmath29 let us note that for the concrete model ( [ 3]),([4 ] ) we consider @xmath30 .",
    "if the functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 satisfy the assumptions 1,2 and the initial data @xmath31 is a continuous function then there exists a classical solution ( @xmath27 has continuous first derivative with respect to @xmath26 and second derivative with respect to @xmath32 up to the boundary @xmath33 and satisfies equation ( [ 7 ] ) , see [ 5,9 ] ) of the problem ( [ 7 ] ) , ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "further , in section 4 , we show that our difference scheme satisfies a discrete analogue of the following maximum principle , see [ 5,9 ] :    let assumptions 1 , 2 hold .",
    "then @xmath34    the dirichlet problem on the domain @xmath35 for the black - scholes equation [ 3 ] , studied by song wang [ 15 , equation ( 2.9a ) ] , has the form ( [ 3 ] ) with coefficients : @xmath36 in [ 15 ] @xmath27 denotes the value of a european call or put option , @xmath37 denotes the volatility of the asset , the interest rate are denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath38 are the dividends .",
