    "at a distance of @xmath23.5 mpc @xcite , the radio galaxy centaurus  a is one of the nearest and brightest active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . since its discovery over three decades ago @xcite ( note , however , @xcite ) , many x - ray to gamma - ray instruments",

    "observations have revealed evidence for a small ( @xmath240 pc ) , inclined disk of ionized gas ( schreier et al .",

    "@xcite suggested that mid - ir observations resolved the nuclear region of size @xmath23 pc , and together this might explain the lack of a hidden broad line region in cen  a @xcite .",
    "the power law index of cen  a below 100 kev has remained at @xmath5 for the last 40 years with the exception of 19721973 when _",
    "oso-7 _ found the index to be @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum does not show any reflection component or a significant broad iron k@xmath7-line @xcite , and yet it is rapidly variable @xcite .",
    "this would imply , in contrast to radio - quiet seyfert galaxies , that a cold accretion disk extending down close to the black hole may not be the source of the high energy radiation and the reprocessor is relatively far away .",
    "furthermore , the hard x - ray spectra of individual seyfert  1s show an underlying continuum which is a power law , with a nearly exponential rolloff with a folding energy of @xmath2100300 kev @xcite .",
    "cen a , on the other hand , does show @xmath2mev range emission , thereby indicating it is quite different from the radio - quiet seyferts .",

    "the _ integral _ and _ rxte _ data will be found in ",

    "5 we use these results to discuss the emission processes in the nuclear region of cen  a , and present our conclusions in   6 .",
    "we present an extensive analysis of each instrument s response to cen  a as well as an inter - calibration of the 2 missions in the appendix . included in the appendix",

    "_ integral _ and _ rxte _ observed cen a three times as part of the _ integral _ ao-1 and _ rxte _ ao-7 proposal cycles in march 2003 and early 2004 .",
    "the _ integral _ observations utilized the joint european x - ray monitor ( jem - x ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the integral soft gamma - ray imager ( isgri ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) portion of the imager onboard the integral satellite ( ibis ) , and the spectrometer on board integral ( spi ; * ? ? ?",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "observations used the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; * ? ? ?",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] gives the details of these three observations plus the previous three _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "the _ integral _ observations are essentially continuous due to the @xmath272 hr elliptical orbit , while the _ rxte _ observations are broken - up due to south atlantic anomaly passages , earth - occults , and unavoidable slews to other targets for short periods of time .",
    "consequently , livetimes for _ integral _ instruments are greater than those for _ rxte_. the single _ rxte _ proportional counter pcu2 has 14 times the background - subtracted counting rate of the jemx-2 detector , and hexte has 95% of the isgri background - subtracted counting rate . as seen below , the small pcu2 and hexte fields of view ( @xmath8 fwhm ) and low backgrounds result in _ rxte_-derived spectral parameters with significantly smaller uncertainties than those derived from _ integral _ spectral data .",
    "the analysis of the data from the _ integral _",
    "instruments used the off - line scientific analysis ( osa ) 4.2 , and followed the osa 4.2 procedures outlined in the various instrument analysis user manuals .",
    "specifically , coded mask deconvolution , as opposed to the open / closed pixel method , was used .",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "instruments analysis was based upon the warwick / tbingen / ucsd scripts that make use of the heasarc - provided _ rxte _ ftools of heasoft release 5.3.1 .",
    "due to the variable number of pcus on at any one time , data for all observations were available only for pcus 0 and 2 .",
    "we chose to limit the detector selection further to just pcu2 , since pcu0 had lost its propane veto layer in the spring of 2000 @xcite , and calibration / background estimates for pcu0 were not as mature as those for pcu2 .",
    "an absorbed power law plus narrow iron line spectral model ( phabs*(power + gauss ) ) has been used to represent the flux from cen  a for all observations . since jem - x did not detect the iron line seen by the pca , and since large jem - x residuals prevented meaningful estimation of upper limits to the line flux , the line was not included in the _ integral _ fitting .",
    "the following energy ranges were used in the fitting process : pcu2 ( 2.560 kev ) , hexte ( 17240 kev ) , jem - x ( 330 kev ) , isgri ( 22.5100 kev ) , and spi ( 20250 kev ) .",
    "no systematic errors have been added to the spi or hexte data .",
    "we have added 0.3% systematic errors to the pcu2 data in order to obtain @xmath9 values near 1 , since the statistical errors are very much smaller than the systematic ones .",
    "this is consistent with suggested systematic errors from fitting the crab @xcite .",
    "( see appendix  [ sec : pcu2_residuals ] for a discussion of additional specific pcu2 systematic effects that were modeled as part of the fitting procedure . ) on the other hand , we have had to add systematic errors to the isgri and jem - x data due to incomplete modeling of the instrument / background response ( see   [ sec : jemx ] & [ sec : isgri ] ) .",
    "the observation - dependent systematic errors added to jem - x and isgri data are given in table  [ tab : jemx_isgri_spi_fits ] .",
    "all errors quoted in this paper represent 90% confidence intervals , with the exception of 1@xmath10 errors for counting rates that were generated by the show rate command in xspec .",
    "errors on fluxes and equivalent widths for individual instrument fits were determined using the flux and eqw commands within xspec with the err option invoked using 500 trials .",
    "they rely on the assumption that the parameter value distribution is multivariate gaussian centered on the best - fit parameters , and are only an approximation in the case that the fit statistic space is not quadratic .",
    "the pcu2 was taken to be the reference instrument when pca / hexte spectra were fitted , and when only _ integral _ data were analyzed , jem - x spectra provided the reference flux .",
    "the _ integral _ data are comprised of a series of @xmath22000 s science windows ( scws ) containing the science data .",
    "we investigated the significance of the 2040 kev flux in the images from each scw included in our observation with respect to cen  a. in obs .",
    "4 , revolution 48 , scws 9295 had questionable non - detections , assumed to be due to nearing passage through the radiation belts .",
    "these scws were not included in the analysis , while all others were .",
    "we also identified the scws that contained cen  a in the jem - x field of view . a separate list of scws than for that of isgri and spi was used for the jem - x analysis , due to the smaller jem - x field of view , and the fact that the dithering would move cen  a from the jem - x field of view .",
    "data were only accumulated from the inner @xmath11 radius region in jem - x in order to avoid inclusion of spurious events from the edge of the detector system .",
    "consequently , the amount of jem - x data was less than that of isgri or spi .",
    "no attempt was made to extract picsit spectra , since osa  4.2 does not provide software for spectral extraction of picsit data .",
    "counting rates and exposure times are given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the _ integral _ observations were made using the dithering mode of _ integral _ in which the field of view is stepped around a selected hexagonal pattern in 2@xmath12 steps .",
    "this is to help suppress systematic effects associated with background variations in spi .",
    "the last third of obs .",
    "4 was taken in the staring mode where the satellite remained pointed directly at cen  a.    the _ rxte _ data accumulations were restricted to times when cen  a was more than @xmath13 above the earth s limb from _ rxte _ s point of view , when _ rxte _ was more than 30 minutes past the beginning of a south atlantic anomaly passage , when the pointing direction was within @xmath14 of the cen  a position , and when the pcu2 and hexte high voltages were at their nominal values .",
    "since the isgri instrument presented the best view of the multi - source sky at 20 kev , it was used initially to form images of the field of view of each observation .",
    "cen a , ic4329a , ngc 4945 , and ngc 4509 were the only sources detected during the cen  a observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ) .",
    "the catalog of sources used in subsequent analyses included only these 3 sources .",
    "in addition , flag and sel_flag parameters in the catalog were set to 1 to force inclusion of data from portions of the telemetry where the source was in the field of view but might not meet the detection level criterion . in this manner ,",
    "spectral data were accumulated from all available telemetry .",
    "this approach is essential to the proper measurement of the flux ; using only the detections above a given threshold will bias the result to higher fluxes .",
    "the jem - x spectral histograms were rebinned from the original 256 channels covering 0 - 82 kev to 34 energy bins with @xmath15  kev / channel from 38 kev , and @xmath16  kev / channel from 830 kev .",
    "the isgri data were grouped into 30 energy bins that were initially 2 kev / channel at 22.5 kev and increased to 100 kev / channel for 200 kev and beyond .",
    "the present isgri analysis was limited , however , to 22.5100 kev due to recommendations from the isgri team ( p. ubertini , private communication ) and large residuals above 100 kev ( see appendix  [ sec : isgri ] ) .",
    "the spi data were logarithmically binned into 20 channels from 20250 kev for the individual observations and no spi channels were ignored in the analysis .",
    "the pcu2 spectral data were not rebinned .",
    "the hexte data remained at 1 kev / channel up to @xmath250 kev , were then grouped at 5 kev / channel until @xmath2160 kev above which the binning was 10 kev / channel .",
    "cen  a was also in the field of view during observations of ngc  4945 taken just after obs .",
    "we have extracted isgri and spi spectra for this observation also ( cen  a was always outside the jem - x field of view ) to determine if they could add to the present results .",
    "the lower statistical quality of these spectra due to the reduced off - target response did not justify their inclusion , but they did provide insight into results for sources ngc  4945 and ngc  4509 offset from the target direction during the present observations ( see appendix  [ sec:150 ] ) .",
    "the six spectral accumulations for both pca and hexte were made using the standard data formats present in all _ rxte _ observations , independent of the specific modes chosen by the observers .",
    "the pca skyvle background model was used for pca background subtraction , while the hexte realtime off - source observations provided the data for hexte background subtraction .",
    "the hexte instrument design includes continuous , automatic gain control which allows for the use of a single instrument response throughout the mission .",
    "the accumulation of background observations of four overlapping regions of the sky just beyond the source position minimizes any systematic effects due to temporal and spatial variations in the hexte background measurement within statistical uncertainties . consequently ,",
    "systematic uncertainties in hexte source spectra arise only from those in the instrument response to x - rays and the hexte deadtime calculation .",
    "the effect of the latter can be estimated by the size of the adjustment of the amount of measured background required in an iterative fitting process , as described for the pcu2 ( appendix  [ sec : pcu2_residuals ] ) .",
    "for hexte , this yielded about ( 0.1@xmath170.1)% at the 1@xmath10 uncertainty level .",
    "the hexte data were collected in each cluster separately , and the two off - source positions for each cluster were checked for confusing source(s ) by comparing rates . upon finding no evidence for such sources ,",
    "the two off - source regions of each cluster were added to form each cluster s background spectrum .",
    "then both the source and background spectral data from the two clusters were combined to form a single set of hexte source and background files for analysis .",
    "the best - fit parameters without additional systematic errors for an absorbed power law model for the jem - x observations of cen  a are given in table  [ tab : jemx_isgri_spi_fits ] and the resulting spectra are shown on the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : jemx_spectra ] . comparing the residuals to the fits in the three spectra reveals a broad feature centered at @xmath27 kev , which may be the combination of two narrow lines , in the latter two observations . a third line - like feature",
    "is also seen in the obs .",
    "6 residuals near 20 kev .",
    "two approaches were tried to address the systematics in the spectral analysis :",
    "1 ) the addition of gaussian components in the spectral model , and 2 ) the addition of systematic error to the spectral data ( see appendix  [ sec : jemx_lines ] ) .",
    "since the first observation has no strong evidence of these two lines , we speculate that they are associated with a gain variation with time that is not included in the jem - x instrument response calculation .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ sec : jemx_lines ] , the latter prescription of adding systematic errors to the data to achieve @xmath18 was found to be preferable .",
    "the results of fitting with systematic errors added are given in table  [ tab : jemx_isgri_spi_fits ] and shown on the right hand side of fig .",

    "the 3 individual values of @xmath24 and of @xmath25 are consistent with the respective mean values at the 90% confidence level .",
    "thus , only variations in the overall flux were detected by jem - x .",
    "the isgri spectra were initially fit to the full 13 - 400 kev energy range to determine the extent of significant detections of cen  a. as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : isgri_spectra ]  ( left ) , very significant residuals to the fit are present below @xmath26 kev , near 60 kev , and between 100 and 150 kev .",
    "these residuals are present in all 3 observations to some extent .",
    "the analysis energy range was then reduced to 22.5100 kev to concentrate on the high statistical significance portion of the data , and the fitting was redone . since the energy range of isgri precluded determination of the line of sight column depth , the jem - x value for each observation was used .",
    "table  [ tab : jemx_isgri_spi_fits ] gives the best - fit spectral parameters for the case of no systematic errors added to the data , and for the case when they were added to achieve @xmath18 .",
    "the trend , however , was to require more systematic errors for the later observations ( 3.5% for obs .  4 , 7.5% for obs .  5 , and 9.5% for obs.6 )",
    "this may indicate a time - dependent calibration is required for isgri analysis .",

    "the observation - to - observation flux variation seen by jem - x is also present in the isgri results .",
    "the spi data were initially accumulated over the 20600 kev range , again , to understand the range of detection of cen  a. this resulted in our choice to analyze the spi data from 20250 kev in 20 logarithmically spaced bins .",
    "as was true for isgri , the jem - x value for the line of sight absorption was used in fitting each spi histogram .",

    "the range of reduced @xmath29 was 0.45@xmath301.10 and thus there was no need for any additional systematic uncertainties to be added .",
    "the mean power law index @xmath22=1.78@xmath23 , and the 3 individual values are consistent with this value .",
    "spi fluxes reflected those seen by jem - x .",
    "the residuals to initial fits to pcu2 data and the procedures to address the systematic effects causing them are discussed in appendix  [ sec : pcu2_residuals ] . by applying these procedures ,",
    "the entire 2.860 kev energy band of the pcu2 becomes available for analysis , and at the same time , this expands the overlapping coverage of pcu2 and hexte to 17 - 60 kev .",

    "corrections to the pcu2 background estimate are at the few percent level with 1@xmath10 uncertainties of a few tenths of a percent .",

    "these values are consistent with their counterparts from the pcu2 data .      comparing the best - fit values from the _ rxte _ observations allows for long term variability to be assessed , and comparing _ integral",

    "the effective areas of the pca and hexte on _ rxte _ have been extensively calibrated in the laboratory and in orbit with present day residuals to spectral fitting at the percent level or less .",
    "similarly , the _ integral _ instruments have had extensive ground calibrations ; however , the absolute effective area of each instrument , the in - orbit instrument response , and the instrumental background subtraction technique are still being addressed through regular osa releases .",
    "for intercomparison of individual instruments , the _ rxte_/pcu2 is assumed to provide the `` true '' values of column density and power law index . the mean pcu2 column density for obs .",

    "we see that the jem - x value is consistent with the pcu2 value at the 90% confidence level , and the pcu2 is 20 times more sensitive to column density in this instance .",
    "comparison of the mean power law indices reveals that jem - x and spi agree easily with pcu2 due to their relatively large uncertainities of 0.17 for indices of 1.80 and 1.78 , respectively , but that the mean isgri best fit index is 0.18@xmath170.09 larger .",
    "averaged over the first 3 observations , hexte and pcu2 power law indices are nearly identical ( 1.830@xmath41 vs. 1.834@xmath34 ) , and are a bit farther apart in the second set of three observations ( 1.794@xmath42 vs. 1.825@xmath43 ) .",

    "the present finding of constant column density in the 3 earlier _ rxte _ observations compared to the claim of variation by @xcite can be attributed to the new calibration ( heasoft 5.3.1 ) and to the ability to analyze pcu2 data to 60 kev .",

    "the second possibility is variable structure in the outer edge of the disk .",

    "another possible explanation is precession of the warped accretion disk @xcite creating a variable absorption .",
    "the lower column depth would represent the time when the edge of the disk raised or lowered to allow a more direct view of the emission region , and the higher values could be associated with the edge of the disk returning to attenuate the x - ray emission .",

    "the power law index at that time did not change from 1.83 .",

    "we conclude that the primary emission region producing the power law component is independent of the absorbing region .",
    "we also note that the x - ray telescopes _ asca , chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have larger uncertainties in their determination of the continuum than the non - imaging missions with energy ranges extending to higher values .",

    "the reflection component is attractive , since calculations by @xcite show that the power law component can exhibit large variations due to the position of the primary emission above the accretion disk while the iron line flux variations would be an order of magnitude less .",
    "a reflection component is not required from the spectral analysis @xcite , however , and thus the contribution to the observed iron line flux would be minimal . on the other hand , transmission through a line - of - sight absorbing medium ( outer edge of an accretion disk or an obscuring torus ) would predict that the equivalent width would vary with column depth with an equivalent width of @xmath2100 ev for @xmath73 @xmath21 @xcite .",

    "this physical separation would easily support the observation of reduced equivalent widths with increased continuum flux , as seen in each set of 3 observations by _ rxte _ that are characterized by a single value of the column depth .",
    "if the iron line flux represents a measure of the beamed flux , estimates of the line flux indicate that the jet luminosity is on the order of the x - ray continuum luminosity from the cen  a core .",

    "we note two episodes of @xmath77 separated by @xmath220 years , and speculate that variability in the structure of the outer edge of the warped accretion disk could explain the observed variability .",
    "since the continuum shape and iron line flux did not vary significantly , we suggest that they are separate from each other and the intervening material .    where , then , does the fe k@xmath7 line originate ?",

    "are expected . alternatively , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , such lines could also originate in the broad line region , with the size of the region again being sufficiently large that one would not expect a correlation between the flux from the central source and the line strength .",
    "we note , however , that the presence of a jet is one crucial difference between radio quiet seyfert galaxies and objects such as cen a or radio - loud qsos .",
    "as has been recently shown for both galactic black hole candidates and for low luminosity agn , a significant fraction of the x - ray emission from these systems could also be explained by synchrotron - self comptonization radiation from the base of the radio jet and thus not be due to thermal comptonization ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and therein ) .",
    "the lack of a roll - over and reflection component in cen a , as opposed to seyfert galaxies , could therefore also be due to jet emission , with beaming or the small footprint of the jet reducing the amount of reflection expected .",
    "in these models , the advected flow at the base of the jet produces the hot electrons and ssc radiation could extend to high energies . in seyfert galaxies , the jet could be less beamed / thermal , or thermal comptonization could be more dominant , resulting in the observed roll - over .",
    "if this is the case , then the observed line emission could also originate from a region that , due to beaming , is significantly more illuminated by the jet than the disk . as we would not see the illuminating radiation but only the fe k@xmath7 emission , which is emitted isotropically",
    ", no correlation between the continuum and the fe line flux would be expected .",
    "in addition , such a model could also explain the absence of hidden broad lines from radio galaxies like cen a , as the jet may sweep out the material that otherwise would form the broad line region .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to quantify these effects , as they all strongly depend on the unknown jet - kinematics at the base of the jet .",
    "naturally , the iron line emission could be a combination of these effects , where the fraction transmitted through a torus ( where the line flux would be proportional to the primary flux ) is small compared to that reradiated at a distance .",
    "the lack of an iron edge at 7.1 kev in the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ spectra @xcite as well as the _ rxte _ data , further complicates the question of the origin of the iron line in cen  a.    rer acknowledges chris fragile for discussions on black hole disk precession , and phil uttley on iron line and continuum variability .",

    "the _ rxte_/pcu2 was the only instrument of the 5 considered here that required a small , but significant , correction to the estimated background .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in the pcu2 360 kev source detection is 0.12% , whereas the skyvle background model is not predicted to be accurate to better than a few percent in any given observation .",
    "the effect of this was evident in the initial spectral fitting as a systematically negative flux above 2030 kev .",
    "the pcu2 background is derived from a background model , which in turn is derived from fitting background observations to mean particle counting rates @xcite . with the large collecting area of the pcu2 detector ,",
    "statistical errors are quite small ( @xmath76% ) and thus systematic uncertainties in the background model as applied to specific observations can be seen in background - subtracted source spectra .",
    "the correction to the pcu2 background level was accomplished by an iterative process of adjusting the amount of background and then performing a @xmath29 fit to the basic spectral model ( phabs*(power + gauss(fe ) ) ) until the @xmath29 was minimized .",
    "technically , this was done through a series of fit and recor commands within xspec , with the estimated background data file also serving as the correction file .",
    "note , that this procedure is most effective when the source flux spans the entire pca energy range .",
    "optimizing the background estimate in this manner , however , may not be practical for observations of steep spectrum sources .",
    "as seen in table  [ tab : pcu2_hexte_fits ] , the corrections to the pcu2 background estimates ( denoted by cornorm ) average about 3% of background .",
    "hexte background is measured nearly continuously during each observation , and is a better estimate of the background than that from a model . over the 18240 kev band ,",
    "the uncertainty in the source flux is @xmath15% .",
    "the mean hexte background corrections are 0.15% with 1-@xmath10 uncertainty of about 0.1% .",
    "thus , the hexte background corrections are smaller than the detection significance and are consistent with zero at 3-@xmath10 .",
    "the _ integral _ instruments all derive their background estimates from the background that is a natural part of coded mask image deconvolution techniques . to use isgri as an example , the statistical source detection uncertainty is @xmath78% of the source flux , which is about the same as the uncertainty in the estimated background .",
    "none of the _ integral _ spectra had the signature of a problem with background subtraction ( consistently positive or negative residuals over a portion of the spectrum ) , and using a small fraction of the estimated background as a correction to the subtracted background did not yield any increase in the goodness of the fits .",
    "thus , we do not choose to alter the estimates of background of the individual _ integral _ instruments .",
    "by far the largest factor in finding an acceptable 3 - 60 kev fit to pcu2 data on cen  a was correcting the background estimate . in all cases ,",
    "the background was oversubtracted by 1.54.5% ( see appendix  [ sec : bkgd ] above ) .",
    "with the background subtraction optimized , significant residuals to fitting the basic spectral model were seen at 8 kev ( positive ) , @xmath230 kev ( positive then negative ) , and near 60 kev ( much smaller positive then negative ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcu2_residuals](top ) . the deviations from the model",
    "were also reflected in the high @xmath9 values for obs .",
    "the 8 kev residual can be attributed to imperfect modeling of the amount of copper fluorescence from the be / cu collimator , as also indicated in cas  a calibration data ( appendix  [ sec : casa ] ) .",
    "the f - test yields probabilities near a few percent for the need of the copper line in the modeling .",
    "the low significance of the line did not allow for simultaneous determination of the flux and centroid energy , and thus the line centroid energy was fixed at the copper k@xmath47 value of 8.04 kev .",
    "the flux of the residual copper line averaged about @xmath79 photons @xmath21 s@xmath50 .",
    "this weak copper k@xmath47 line was then included in subsequent analyses ( phabs*(power + gauss(fe ) ) + gauss(cu ) ) to compensate for this effect .",
    "this leaves the residuals near 30 and 60 kev .",
    "as mentioned by @xcite and seen in their figure 20 , the pcu2 background has residual emission lines at 26 , 30 , and 60 kev from unflagged events from the @xmath80am calibration source in each pcu .",
    "it is quite possible that the pcu2 background model has an ever - so - slightly different gain than the observed cen  a data , and that this is the origin of the residual seen in the cen  a data at 60 kev .",
    "the fact that the fitted intensities of a set of positive and negative gaussians around 60 kev are essentially equal , further supports this hypothesis .",
    "the inclusion of a positive and negative set of gaussian functions offset by @xmath22 kev at @xmath259 and 61 kev ( phabs*(power + gauss(fe ) ) + gauss(cu ) + gauss(am+ ) + gauss(am- ) ) , not only removed the small residual at 60 kev , but it vastly improved the fit to the data near the xenon k - edge at 33 kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pcu2_residuals](bottom ) ) .",
    "this is due the fact that inclusion of a positive or negative line near 60 kev produces k - escape lines ( positive or negative ) near 30 kev .",
    "again , the low counting rate of the lines ( @xmath81 photons @xmath21 s@xmath50 ) and reduced pcu2 detector efficiency at 60 kev limited the number of free line parameters in the fitting process .",
    "after some experimentation , it was found that having the positive line centroid energy free , and the absolute value of the intensities of the two lines set to be equal , allowed the fit to converge .",
    "the positive gaussian centroid averaged @xmath82 kev and the negative gaussian centroid was fixed at 61 kev .",
    "we , therefore , will include an 8.04 kev emission line and a fitted @xmath258.7 kev emission line plus matching negative gaussian fixed at 61 kev to all fits to cen  a.    in the case of obs .",

    "in order to estimate the systematic uncertainties in cen  a line centroids , fluxes , and power law indices , we analyzed 11 cas a pointings taken over the history of _ rxte _ as a calibration standard .",
    "we used only pcu2 data and selected the energy range of 2.525 kev .",
    "the lower energy was chosen to be as low as possible before encountering effects of the hardware low energy threshold .",
    "since the majority of the cas  a observations had livetimes of a few thousand seconds , no significant flux was seen above 25 kev , and thus spectra were truncated at 25 kev .",
    "again , systematics of 0.3% were added to the cas  a data .",
    "we modeled the cas  a spectrum as a power law plus four gaussians representing emission from s , ca , ar , and fe , and their respective energies were fixed at 2.45 , 3.12 , and 3.87 kev for the first three lines @xcite . the fe line centroid was free to assume its best fit value , and its width was fixed at @xmath10=0.01 kev .",
    "a fifth line at 8.04 kev was added to represent incomplete modeling of the copper collimator k@xmath47 fluorescence line ( appendix  [ sec : pcu2_residuals ] ) .",
    "our iterative procedure described above also estimated that @xmath25% corrections to the background were required .",

    "the observation dates span four of the five pca gain / response epochs  none were available for epoch 1 .",
    "epoch 5 did not entail a gain change , but represents the time at which pcu0 lost its propane veto layer .",
    "thus , the response for pcu2 did not change from epoch 4 to 5 , other than the slow gain variation with time for which pcarsp makes correction . from this analysis",
    "we see that the low energy absorption was constant as was the power law index . however , the flux from the sulfur line at 2.45 kev ( just below the analysis threshold of @xmath22.5 kev ) abruptly doubled in going from epoch 3 to 4 , and simultaneously , the cas  a 210 kev flux rose from @xmath2(1.30 to 1.55)@xmath87 ergs @xmath21 s@xmath50 .",

    "<S> the _ integral _ osa  4.2 calibration of jem - x , isgri , and spi yields power law indices consistent with the _ rxte _ pca and hexte values , but the indices derived from isgri alone are about 0.2 greater . </S>",
    "<S> significant systematics are the limiting factor for _ integral _ spectral parameter determination . </S>"
