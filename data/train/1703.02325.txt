    "this article lays the ground for the development of a cohomological theory of sheaves of @xmath3-modules over a topos .",
    "the need for such a theory is obvious in tropical geometry and arises naturally in the development of our work on the riemann - roch theorem on the scaling site and its square ( @xcite ) .",
    "the expected new cohomology theory ought to be described in terms of @xmath3-modules .",
    "however , sheaves of @xmath3-modules do not form an abelian category and thus abstract homological algebra can not be applied in its classical form . to by - pass this difficulty , we decided to follow the strategic path developed by grothendieck in his tohoku paper @xcite , where abelian sheaf cohomology is realized as an important example of homological algebra on abelian categories .",
    "therefore this article advocates the existence of a meaningful theory of homological algebra in categories , such as the category of sheaves of @xmath3-modules over a topos , which share the same abstract properties of our selected prototype namely the category @xmath0 of modules over the boolean semifield @xmath1 ( _ cf . _",
    " [ sect bmodules ] ) . in the analogy with the development of homological algebra in abelian categories ,",
    "@xmath0 is the replacement for the category of abelian groups and the results of the present paper should be viewed as the analogue of the development of homological algebra for abelian groups as in @xcite .",
    "the key property that allows to transfer our main results on @xmath0 to the category of sheaves of @xmath4-modules is provided by the well known fact that a constructive proof in a category still holds true in any topos .",
    "the category @xmath0 is usually referred in books as the category of join semi - lattices with a least element , or idempotent semi - modules and has a long history : we refer to @xcite for an overview .",
    "in particular there is a well known equivalence between @xmath0 and the category of algebraic lattices .",
    "this equivalence together with the crucial notion of galois connection are recalled in  [ galois connect ] .",
    "this review is based on the duality results of @xcite whose proofs are given , for the sake of completeness , in the simplest case of @xmath0 .",
    "incidentally , the equivalence of @xmath0 with the category of algebraic lattices provides also the reader with a wealth of concrete and interesting examples even by restricting to the case of finite objects .",
    "in fact @xmath0 plays a universal role taking into account the transfer functor @xcite which associates to an object of a category the lattice of its subobjects .",
    "while @xmath0 is not an additive category it is semi - additive _",
    "i.e. _  it has a zero object ( both initial and final ) , all finite products and coproducts exist , and for any pair of objects @xmath5 in @xmath0 the canonical morphism @xmath6 from the coproduct to the product is an isomorphism .",

    "the analogues of the axioms ab1 and ab2 for abelian categories ( @xcite ,  1.4 ) take the following form    ab1 : @xmath10 admits equalizers @xmath11 and coequalizers @xmath12 .",
    "assuming ab1 we let , for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 be the equalizer of @xmath16 .",

    "the kleisli category @xmath39 has the same objects as @xmath0 whereas the morphisms are pairs of morphisms in @xmath0 composing following the rule @xmath40 the category @xmath39 is the very natural enlargement of @xmath0 where pairs of morphisms are taken into account so that the notions of kernels and cokernels become similar to their incarnations in abelian categories . in  [ weak and strong ] we study , as a technical tool revealing the properties of the category @xmath39 , the following form of exactness    [ exsequ intro ] we say that the sequence @xmath41{\\alpha_1}{\\rightrightarrows}m\\stackbin[\\beta_2]{\\beta_1}{\\rightrightarrows}n$ ] in @xmath39 is _ exact _ at @xmath42 if @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the diagonal and one sets @xmath45 @xmath46    in  [ sectveryshort ] , proposition [ iso9 ] , we show that a sequence @xmath47{0}{\\rightrightarrows}l\\stackbin[g]{f}{\\rightrightarrows}m\\stackbin[0]{0}{\\rightrightarrows}0 $ ] in @xmath39 is exact if and only if @xmath48 is an isomorphism in @xmath39 ( _ i.e. _  is invertible ) .",

    "the conclusion is that while being an epimorphism is equivalent to the exactness of @xmath52{f}{\\rightrightarrows}m\\stackbin[0]{0}{\\rightrightarrows}0 $ ] , being a monomorphism is a more restrictive notion than claiming the exactness of @xmath53{0}{\\rightrightarrows}l\\stackbin[g]{f}{\\rightrightarrows}m$ ] ( _ cf .",

    "the astonishing outcome is that even in the simplest case of the category @xmath2 , the resulting homological algebra is highly non - trivial and gives rise to a computable ext functor . in  [ sectnullmorphisms ] we prove the fundamental result stating that the pair @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the ideal ( closed as in  1.3.2 of @xcite ) of the null morphisms @xmath17 in @xmath2 ( _ i.e. _  @xmath67 ) is a semiexact homological category .",

    "<S> our selected prototype , the category @xmath0 of modules over the boolean semifield @xmath1 is the replacement for the category of abelian groups . we show that the semi - additive category @xmath0 fulfills analogues of the axioms ab1 and ab2 for abelian categories . by introducing a precise comonad on @xmath0 we obtain the conceptually related kleisli and eilenberg - moore categories . the latter category @xmath2 is simply @xmath0 in the topos of sets endowed with an involution and as such it shares with @xmath0 most of its abstract categorical properties . </S>",
    "<S> the three main results of the paper are the following . </S>",
    "<S> first , when endowed with the natural ideal of null morphisms , the category @xmath2 is a semi - exact , homological category in the sense of m. grandis . </S>",
    "<S> second , there is a far reaching analogy between @xmath2 and the category of operators in hilbert space , and in particular results relating null kernel and injectivity for morphisms . </S>",
    "<S> the third fundamental result is that , even for finite objects of @xmath2 the resulting homological algebra is non - trivial and gives rise to a computable ext functor . </S>",
    "<S> we determine explicitly this functor in the case provided by the diagonal morphism of the boolean semiring into its square . </S>"
