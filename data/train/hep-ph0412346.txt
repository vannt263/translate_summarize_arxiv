    "the experimental relativistic heavy ion program at rhic aims to measure the properties of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "one of the most exciting results from rhic so far is the large azimuthal anisotropy of light hadrons with respect to the reaction plane , known as elliptic flow .",
    "elliptic flow has been measured as a function of impact parameter , transverse momentum , rapidity and particle type and is quantified with @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 the observed elliptic flow is significantly larger than was originally expected from kinetic calculations of quarks and gluons @xcite , but in fairly good agreement with simulations based upon ideal hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that the medium responds as a thermalized fluid and that the transport mean free path is small @xcite .    however , this interpretation of the elliptic flow results is not universally accepted @xcite",
    ". hadronization may amplify the underlying partonic elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "indeed , parton coalescence is one mechanism which may amplify the hadronic elliptic flow relative to its partonic constituents @xcite . on physical grounds",
    ", it seems unlikely that the typical mean free path is much smaller than a thermal wavelength , @xmath5 .",
    "indeed it has recently been conjectured that the hydrodynamic diffusion coefficient @xmath6 is strictly larger than half a thermal wavelength @xcite , @xmath7 here @xmath8 is shear viscosity , @xmath9 is the enthalpy , and the ratio is a fundamental length scale in the qgp . if @xmath10 is significantly larger than this conjectured bound hydrodynamics would not be a viable explanation for the observed flow at rhic . in this work",
    "we will accept the hydrodynamic paradigm of the rhic results and study the correlated consequences of this interpretation .",
    "heavy quarks are a good probe of the transport properties of the medium . given an estimate of the light quark relaxation time @xmath11 , the heavy quark relaxation time is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mass of the heavy quark and @xmath14 is the temperature .",
    "thus , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , we expect that the charm equilibration time is approximately @xmath17 times larger than the light quark equilibration time .",
    "since this factor is relatively large , we further expect that the elliptic flow of charm quarks will be smaller than the flow of light hadrons .",
    "in addition , the heavy quarks are produced with a power - law transverse momentum spectrum which deviates strongly from the thermal spectrum .",
    "the relaxation time will control the extent to which the initial power - law spectrum approaches the thermal spectrum .",
    "similarly , the relaxation time will control the extent to which the charm quark will follow the underlying flow of the medium .",
    "if the charm quark completely follows the flow of the medium then thermal spectrum is actually quite close to the perturbative spectrum and it may be difficult to distinguish these two cases @xcite .",
    "medium modifications of the heavy quark spectrum @xmath2 flow will be studied experimentally this year and will provide an experimental estimate of this relaxation time @xcite .",
    "most recent studies of the medium modifications of the charm spectrum have computed the energy loss of a heavy quark by gluon @xcite . in weak coupling",
    "( which is the framework in which all calculations have been performed ) , is the dominant energy loss mechanism only if the heavy quark is ultra - relativistic , @xmath18 .",
    "( similarly , for an electron traversing a hydrogen target , losses first exceed ionization losses when @xmath19 @xcite . ) for much of the measured momentum range , the heavy quark is not ultra - relativistic , @xmath20 , and in this case it is far from clear that radiative energy loss dominates over collisional energy loss .",
    "about two thirds of all heavy quarks are produced with @xmath21 , and therefore radiative energy loss should be neglected when studying bulk thermalization .",
    "when @xmath22 , calculations do suggest that radiation dominates the @xmath23 energy loss rate @xcite .",
    "however , as has been repeatedly emphasized @xcite , the @xmath23 energy loss is insufficient to describe the medium modifications of the spectrum @xmath2 .",
    "collisions have a different fluctuation spectrum than radiation and therefore might contribute more to the suppression factor than was at first anticipated @xcite . since we are primarily interested here in heavy quarks with typical momenta @xmath24 , we will concentrate exclusively on elastic collisions .    considering these points , we will re - examine collisional energy loss of a heavy quark in the perturbative qgp .",
    "our tools are hard thermal loop ( htl ) perturbation theory and a heavy quark expansion ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the average energy loss rate was first computed by braaten and thoma @xcite and we will independently verify their results .",
    "( recently this calculation was extended to anisotropic plasmas by romatschke and strickland @xcite . )",
    "we will also compute the rates of longitudinal and transverse momentum broadening which are essential to a complete calculation of the modification factor @xmath2 .",
    "we will relate all of these rates to the diffusion coefficient which we will compute .",
    "( in principle the diffusion coefficient of a heavy quark could have been gleaned from the results of braaten and thoma @xcite and svetitsky @xcite . ) in perturbation theory , we can compare the diffusion coefficient of the heavy quark to the hydrodynamic time scale @xmath26 which was calculated previously @xcite .",
    "many of the ambiguities of perturbation theory cancel in the ratio of transport coefficients and we therefore hope to be able to extrapolate smoothly into the non - perturbative domain .",
    "following this ideology , we express all of our phenomenological results in terms of the diffusion coefficient which may ultimately be determined from lattice qcd calculations . with these transport properties in hand ,",
    "we adopt a langevin model for the equilibration of heavy quarks in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the langevin equations correctly describe the kinetics of a heavy particle in a thermal medium and therefore naturally interpolate between a hydrodynamic regime at small momentum and a kinetic regime at large momentum .",
    "the model is similar to old work by svetitsky @xcite and was later used without fluctuations to estimate @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the model is strictly valid for non - relativistic quarks and for all velocities to leading logarithm in @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding fokker - planck equation is solved analytically in for a bjorken expansion .",
    "the solution provides a simple estimate for the modification factor @xmath2 and further elucidates the dynamics of equilibration .",
    "then we solve the langevin equations numerically in a hydrodynamic simulation of the heavy ion reaction .",
    "the results of the simulation are the medium modification factor @xmath2 and the corresponding elliptic flow @xmath3 as a function of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "very recently , two papers have adopted a similar langevin approach to address charm equilibration @xcite .",
    "the first of these papers @xcite estimated possible non - perturbative contributions to the drag coefficient which may arise from quasi - hadronic bound states in the qgp .",
    "the second of these papers @xcite estimated radiative and collisional energy loss , and found that collisional loss is significant even for rather energetic charm quarks , @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , classical boltzmann simulations by molnar @xcite and subsequent simulations by zhang _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite have studied how @xmath3 and studied how @xmath3 and @xmath2 depend on the charm mean free path . as is discussed in ,",
    "the results of molnar s simulation are comparable to the boltzmann - langevin approach adopted here . throughout",
    ", we will denote 4-vectors with capital letters @xmath28 and use @xmath29 for their 3-vector components , @xmath30 for their energy components , and @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "our metric convention is [ ,+,+,+ ] .",
    "first consider thermal heavy quarks , @xmath33 , with typical thermal momentum @xmath34 and velocity @xmath35 . since @xmath36 it takes many collisions to change the momentum substantially .",
    "even for hard collisions with momentum transfer @xmath37 , it takes @xmath38 collisions to change the momentum by a factor of order one .",
    "therefore it is a good approximation to model the interaction of the heavy quark with the medium as uncorrelated momentum kicks .",
    "the momentum of the heavy quark will evolve according to the macroscopic langevin equations @xcite @xmath39 here @xmath40 is a momentum drag coefficient and @xmath41 delivers random momentum kicks which are uncorrelated in time .",
    "@xmath42 is the mean squared momentum transfer per unit time .",
    "the solution of this stochastic differential equation is @xmath43 where we have assumed that @xmath44 .",
    "the mean squared value of @xmath45 is @xmath46 and therefore @xmath47    now the diffusion constant in space , @xmath48 , can be found by starting a particle at @xmath49 at @xmath50 and finding the mean squared position at a later time , @xmath51 using the relation between position and momentum @xmath52 we have @xmath53 and therefore the diffusion constant is @xcite @xmath54 in the next paragraphs we will determine the mean squared momentum transfer per unit time , @xmath42 , and then the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the only @xmath55 scattering processes are @xmath56 ( @xmath57 the heavy quark ) and @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath56 process only occurs by @xmath59 channel gluon exchange .",
    "since in the rest frame of the plasma the compton amplitude is suppressed by @xmath60 ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) , the @xmath58 process is also dominated by @xmath59 channel gluon exchange .",
    "kinematics demand that the transfer momentum be spatial up to @xmath61 corrections , so the hard thermal loop correction on the transferred gluon is described simply by debye screening . writing the incoming and outgoing momenta of the thermal particle as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and taking that particle s dispersion relation to be ultra - relativistic ,",
    "the scattering matrix elements squared , summed on the colors and spins of the incoming thermal particles and over all quantum numbers of the final state particles , are ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) , @xmath64 @xmath65 denotes the color casimir of the heavy quark and an extra factor of 2 for the quark case accounts for anti - quarks .",
    "the mean squared momentum transfer per unit time is @xmath42 . to compute this quantity",
    "the matrix elements must be integrated over the incoming momentum @xmath62 and outgoing momenta @xmath63 , @xmath66 , weighted by the appropriate statistical functions and by the squared momentum transfer @xmath67 .",
    "the mean squared momentum transfer per unit time ( @xmath42 ) is then [ eq : kappa1 ] 3 & = & ( 2)^3 ^3(+  - - ) 2 ( k-k ) ^2 + & & . in writing this formula",
    "we have used the non - relativistic limit @xmath68 .",
    "it is convenient to shift the @xmath66 integration to an integral over the momentum transfer @xmath69 ; the momentum conserving delta function becomes @xmath70 .",
    "the appendix shows how a simple change of variables and an expansion in @xmath71 makes these integrals relatively straightforward . using the relation between @xmath72 and the diffusion coefficient",

    "this expression for the diffusion coefficient is based on a small @xmath74 expansion and therefore becomes unreliable when the debye mass becomes large . rather than using a small @xmath74 expansion",
    "we can numerically integrate to determine the the diffusion coefficient .",

    "the rate of equilibration is given by @xmath76 , as can be intuited from the langevin equations , , or from the analysis of .",
    "@xmath76 is directly related to the diffusion coefficient via @xmath77 taking @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 we estimate that the diffusion coefficient is @xmath81 .",

    "it is useful to compare this timescale with other hydrodynamic relaxation times in the qgp .",

    "the shear viscosity at leading order has been taken from @xcite . as seen from the figure , for @xmath86 the diffusion coefficient is @xmath87 times larger than hydrodynamic scale @xmath6 .",
    "both the calculation of the diffusion coefficient @xmath48 and of the shear viscosity @xmath8 are plagued by ambiguities when the coupling is strong , @xmath88 .",
    "in particular , in both processes it is unclear how to screen the plasma when @xmath74 is large and how to estimate the form and size of subleading @xmath89 corrections .",
    "these issues have been discussed in @xcite , but were not resolved .",
    "however , since both processes are dominated by @xmath59-channel gluon exchange , the ambiguities in the calculation should largely cancel in the ratio of transport coefficients .",
    "we therefore hope that the computed factor of @xmath87 for @xmath90 $ ] is largely independent of its perturbative assumptions .",
    "thus , with @xmath91 , @xmath92 and an optimistic estimate of the shear viscosity , @xmath93 , we estimate that the charm quark thermalization time is of order @xmath94 .",
    "this time scale should be compared with the time scale for the development of elliptic flow @xmath95 .",
    "since the initial distribution of charm quarks is much `` harder '' than a thermalized spectrum , it is important to study how higher energy heavy quarks , with @xmath24 , lose their energy in the thermal medium .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of this problem .",
    "our discussion differs from most recent literature in that we take the dominant energy loss mechanism to be elastic scattering .",
    "when the coupling is small , dominates the energy loss rate for very fast particles ( with @xmath97 ) while collisions dominate the rate for moderately relativistic particles with @xmath24 .    to see why ,",
    "consider a heavy particle of momentum @xmath98 , undergoing a scattering .",
    "call its momentum @xmath99 , with @xmath100 . for energy loss in a condensed medium , the scattering is typically off a nucleus , so the transferred 4-momentum @xmath101 is purely spatial . in a thermal medium like the qgp ,",
    "the scattering is off a relativistic particle at a random angle with respect to the heavy particle ; the kinematics of the other particle requires that @xmath101 be spacelike , but @xmath102 can be @xmath103 .",
    "kinematics requires that the lightlike , bremmed particle s momentum @xmath104 satisfy @xmath105 , with @xmath106 the final particle momentum .",
    "@xmath104 can be the largest if it is perfectly collinear with @xmath99 and if @xmath107 is anti - collinear ; in this case , energy conservation reads @xmath108 , while momentum conservation reads @xmath109 .",
    "for the spatial ( coulomb ) scattering case , @xmath110 , while for the qgp case , @xmath111 , so the actual energy loss is @xmath112 . in either case , for @xmath113 , the energy of a bremmed particle is at best of order of the transfer momentum in the scattering .",
    "the energy loss in a scattering process without is @xmath102 .",
    "when @xmath114 the plasma temperature , phase space favors events with @xmath102 negative and of order @xmath115 .",
    "since the rate of is suppressed by an additional factor of @xmath89 , and the typical energy loss is the same , the contribution of to energy loss is smaller by a factor of @xmath89 . in the soft region , @xmath116",
    ", there is an approximate cancellation between energy losing and energy gaining scatterings , and the dominance of @xmath96 processes is only by @xmath73 , but they remain dominant .",
    "softer momentum transfers are screened by the plasma and do not play an important role in energy loss .",
    "very similar arguments apply for electromagnetic energy loss of a high energy particle in a medium , except that the scale @xmath117 is played by the atomic radius and the @xmath96 processes do not have any cancellation between energy losing and gaining processes ; for @xmath118 , energy losses are subdominant to ionization losses ( due to elastic scattering with electrons , transferring more energy than the electron s binding energy ) by @xmath119 .    as the particle s energy increases , the importance of also increases . while the cross - section remains suppressed by a power of @xmath89 , the amount of energy which can be lost in a single event increases .",
    "as we will see , the rate of energy loss by @xmath120 processes only increases logarithmically in @xmath121 .",
    "bremsstrahlung energy losses typically rise almost linearly in @xmath122 , and so become dominant at @xmath123 for electromagnetic processes and at @xmath124 for heavy quark energy loss in the qgp .",
    "since only a small tail of heavy quarks have @xmath125 , we will only treat @xmath55 processes in this work .",
    "first consider a heavy quark in a static medium with @xmath36 and velocity @xmath24 .",
    "it takes @xmath126 collisions to change the momentum of the heavy quark by a factor of order one .",
    "the time between hard collisions is @xmath127 and thus the equilibration time scale a heavy quark is of order @xmath128 .",
    "next consider how a heavy quark with momentum @xmath36 changes over a time interval @xmath129 which is long compared to the timescale of medium correlations but short compared to the time scale of heavy quark thermalization , t .",
    "for @xmath129 large compared to @xmath130 the number of collisions @xmath131 is large @xmath132 . on the other hand the momentum of the heavy particle has scarcely changed since the total momentum transfered",
    "@xmath133 is of order @xmath134 which is small compared to @xmath45 .",
    "this means that the probability distribution for a given momentum transfer from a single collision is approximately constant over this time period .",
    "the accumulated momentum transfer is a sum of @xmath131 such collisions .",
    "the sum of a large number of momentum transfers drawn from an identical probability distribution is approximately gaussian plus corrections which go as @xmath135 . in the next @xmath129 time interval",
    "the process repeats itself independently .",
    "thus we can write down a macroscopic equation of motion for the the heavy quark moving in the @xmath136 direction , @xmath137 here @xmath138 is the variance of the momentum distribution transverse to the direction of the heavy quark , @xmath139 is the variance of the momentum distribution in the direction parallel to the direction of the quark , and the time derivatives are understood to act only on a time scale of order @xmath129 .",
    "the factor of @xmath140 in the transverse fluctuations has been inserted because there are two perpendicular directions .",
    "the functions @xmath40 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 encode the average momentum loss and the transverse and longitudinal fluctuations .",
    "now we will compute these coefficients using kinetic theory .",
    "first we will compute the mean rate of momentum loss .",
    "this is most easily done by computing the energy loss rate , @xmath143 , which is related to the momentum loss by @xmath144 .",
    "the energy loss rate is found by multiplying the scattering rate with transfer energy @xmath102 , schematically , = _ k , q ||^2 q^0 f[k ] ( 1f[k - q^0 ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath102 is not enough to render this ir convergent , but there are cancellations between @xmath145 and @xmath146 contributions .",
    "it is easiest to account for these by averaging in the integrand over the process with @xmath147 incoming and @xmath148 outgoing , and the process with @xmath148 incoming , @xmath147 outgoing , and opposite @xmath101 . because we take @xmath149 the kinematics and matrix element are the same , but the population functions differ , yielding = _ k , q ||^2 q^0 \\ { f[k ] ( 1f[k - q^0 ] ) - f[k - q^0 ] ( 1f[k ] ) } .",
    "[ eq : fs ] the population function here is @xmath150 f[k - q^0]$ ] , which vanishes at small @xmath102 and makes the integral well behaved .    similarly , to compute the rate of transverse momentum broadening , we weight the transition rate @xmath151 with the square of the transverse momentum transfer ( p_t)^2 = _ k , q ||^2 q_t^2 f[k ] ( 1f[k - q^0 ] )",
    ". here the integral will be convergent and we do not need to symmetrize over forward and backward collisions . finally the rate of longitudinal momentum broadening is ( p_z)^2 = _ k , q ||^2 q_z^2 f[k ] ( 1f[k - q^0 ] ) . again this integral",
    "is convergent .",
    "thus to compute the transport coefficients @xmath40 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 we need to specify the matrix elements and perform ( numerically ) the phase space integrals .",

    "the inclusion of hard thermal loops is only necessary at small @xmath152 , where the leading @xmath153 term dominates ; the details appear in the appendix .",
    "this introduces the debye mass into the problem and thus the results will generally depend on the ratio of @xmath154 .",

    "this diffusion coefficient should be compared with the perturbative estimate made in , @xmath325 the suppression seen in ( a ) at large transverse momentum , @xmath326 , is somewhat overestimated since the langevin description underestimates the longitudinal fluctuations by a factor of three to four in this momentum range . however , for @xmath327 radiation should become important and further suppress the spectrum .",
    "examining ( a ) at large momentum , we see that the suppression decreases only slightly for @xmath328 greater than @xmath329 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the suppression pattern seen in the light hadron data .",
    "it seems that all calculation which have a reasonably complete model of the fluctuations can reproduce this trend @xcite .",
    "this suppression pattern is approximately independent of the model for the transport coefficients .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ raa2](a ) , we see essentially the same pattern when @xmath167 .",
    "however , in this case the magnitude of the suppression is significantly smaller for a given value of the diffusion coefficient .    turning to elliptic flow",
    ", we see in fig .",
    "[ raa](b ) that the heavy quark elliptic flow rises with momentum until @xmath330 , and then flattens .",
    "( when @xmath331 , @xmath3 shows a qualitatively different behavior which will be discussed shortly . ) a similar transition is seen in the elliptic flow of light hadrons , illustrated by the band in the figure . for the light hadron data , it has been argued that the transition from rising to flat is controlled by transport coefficients , and signals a transition from a quasi - thermal to a kinetic regime @xcite .",
    "a similar argument can be given here .",
    "examining fig .",
    "[ raa](a ) , we see that @xmath2 has a funny shape at low momentum and then starts to fall exponentially .",
    "these features reflect the thermal distribution . at higher momentum",
    ", @xmath2 stops falling exponentially and approaches a constant .",
    "this transition coincides with the transition seen in @xmath3 and depends on the diffusion coefficient . a detailed study of the correlation between the initial angle of the charm quark and the final angle of the charm quark confirms the qualitative conclusion that the changes seen in @xmath332 and @xmath2 for @xmath333 reflect a transition from a quasi - thermal to a kinetic regime .",
    "only models which smoothly interpolate between these two regimes can effortlessly reproduce these trends in the entire @xmath334 range .    it has been argued that the charm quark could participate in the flow , and thus be pushed out to higher transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "this scenario depends on the diffusion coefficient .",
    "a detailed analysis of the initial and final momenta of the charm quarks shows that , unless the diffusion coefficient is @xmath335 or less , the charm quarks are not pushed to higher momentum by the flow .",
    "indeed , when the diffusion coefficient is greater than @xmath336 , a particle with final momentum @xmath337 gev typically started with momentum larger than this value .",
    "when the diffusion coefficient is small , @xmath338 , the heavy quarks are pushed out to higher momentum by the flow .",
    "this push is reflected in the @xmath334 dependence of the elliptic flow , as illustrated in ( b ) .",
    "the rapid fall of @xmath3 for @xmath339 indicates that the hydrodynamics is not able to push the heavy quarks beyond this transverse momentum for this diffusion coefficient .",
    "the @xmath328 dependence of the elliptic flow also reflects aspects of the underlying qcd matrix elements .",
    "in contrast to a constant energy loss model , where @xmath167 , the lo qcd drag coefficient rises with the momentum of the heavy quark ( see ( a ) ) . consequently , in the constant energy loss model , the elliptic flow decreases steadily at large momentum rather than remain constant as in the lo qcd model .",
    "the elliptic flows of the two models are compared in ( b ) and ( b ) .",
    "examining fig .",
    "[ raa](a ) and ( b ) , we reach the important conclusion that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are tightly correlated . at low momentum , this correlation is encoded in einstein s relation between the energy loss and the hydrodynamic diffusion coefficient , @xmath340 it is impossible to have a large elliptic flow without also predicting a significant suppression of charm quarks . indeed ,",
    "if future measurements find the charm elliptic flow strong , and the spectrum not suppressed , the present authors must logically conclude that hydrodynamics is not responsible for the observed elliptic flow .",
    "this strong conclusion might be mitigated if coalescence or some other exotic hadronization mechanism manages to make the @xmath48 meson elliptic flow significantly larger than the underlying @xmath341-quark elliptic flow .",

    "our simulation with @xmath322 corresponds to his simulation with @xmath323 for central collisions and @xmath310 .",
    "however , in molnar s work , the final d - meson elliptic flow is significantly larger than the underlying c - quark flow as a result of coalescence .",
    "similarly in the simulation of zhang _",
    "_ , the final d - meson elliptic flow is amplified by coalescence , although the amplification factor is smaller than in molnar s work due to the details of the coalescence model . whether coalescence can amplify",
    "the elliptic flow of d - mesons in a complete dynamical setting remains unclear @xcite . in summary , we have calculated various transport coefficients for a heavy fermion in the perturbative quark gluon plasma . since the gamma factor of the charm quark is not particularly large in much of the experimental momentum range , @xmath20 , collisions rather than radiation should determine the medium modifications of the heavy quark spectrum .",
    "therefore , we have re - examined collisional energy loss , and also calculated momentum broadening , which is essential to determine how the heavy quark spectrum will be modified . to quantitatively asses the modifications of the heavy quark spectrum , we formulated a boltzmann - langevin model for the heavy quark kinetics .",
    "the model is strictly valid for non - relativistic quarks and for relativistic quarks to leading log of @xmath1 .",
    "we characterized the strength of the energy loss and momentum diffusion in terms of the diffusion coefficient , which in perturbation theory is approximately , @xmath342 .",
    "the boltzmann - langevin model was solved analytically for a bjorken expansion , giving a simple estimate shown in for the medium modifications of the heavy quark spectrum .",
    "then we solved the langevin equations numerically , yielding the modification factor @xmath2 and @xmath3 for charm quarks .",
    "the results are shown in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficient for a relativistic plasma is of order @xmath343 , where @xmath344 is the typical collision time of the heavy quark .",
    "thus , future measurements at rhic will produce a tantalizing estimate of this fundamental time scale . since the diffusion coefficient is a well defined concept , this estimate",
