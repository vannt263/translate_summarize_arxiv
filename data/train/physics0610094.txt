    "solid state experimentalists , especially spectroscopists , still need a reliable scale quantitatively characterizing the effect of crystal - field interaction , i.e. defining the so - called crystal - field strength .",
    "such a parameter could directly verify and compare various parametrizations of the crystal - field hamiltonian @xmath6 , which may come from different fittings experimental data when the orientations of reference frames associated with these parametrizations are unknown in the majority of cases .",
    "although such a conventional scale for measuring the strength of the crystal - field has been already introduced over twenty years ago [ 1,2 ] , in some cases it seems to be insufficiently precise .",
    "it employs the basic rotational invariants of the @xmath3 , i.e. the modules of its @xmath7-pole components @xmath8 , defined as @xmath9 , as well as uses the global @xmath6 modulus @xmath10 . in the first case",
    "the partial crystal - field strength is defined as @xmath11 , while in the second case the global crystal - field strength is given by @xmath12 . throughout the paper the tensor ( wybourne ) notation for the crystal - field hamiltonian and the crystal - field parameters ( cfps ) , @xmath13 ,",
    "is consistently used [ 3 ] .",
    "the summations over @xmath14 and @xmath15 indices run , in each individual case , over strictly specified values according to the kind of central ion and its point symmetry .",
    "both the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 themselves are not a direct measure of the real magnitude of the initial state splitting , since the crystal - field effect depends also on the properties of an object ( a paramagnetic ion ) upon which the @xmath3 acts .",
    "namely , the response of the system to the @xmath3 perturbation reflects the symmetry of the electron density distribution of the central ion open - shell .",
    "for instance , an @xmath17-type ion like gd@xmath18 feels no crystal field ( in the first order of perturbation ) no matter how strong is the surrounding field .",
    "the effect of splitting can be most simply expressed by the so - called second moments @xmath19 or @xmath20 of the cf sublevels within the initial state upon switching on the @xmath21 ( or @xmath3 ) perturbation .",
    "in fact , the second moment is easily represented by the scalar crystal - field strength parameters , either @xmath16 or @xmath17 ( section 2 ) . however , although the effective @xmath22 multipoles ( for @xmath2 ) contribute to the energy of individual stark levels independently ( as an algebraic sum ) , the simple linear relations between @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) , and @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) are always fulfilled . as it is proved",
    "these relations strongly confine both the maximal @xmath25 and minimal @xmath26 nominally allowed splittings of the initial state ( section 3 ) . moreover the actual crystal field splittings @xmath27 can be additionally restricted ( section 5 ) .",
    "naturally , all the iso - modular @xmath3 parametrizations correspond to the same crystal - field strengths @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "however , apart from the modules @xmath28 and @xmath29 , there exist also other rotational invariants of the @xmath21 or @xmath3 which distinguish the whole classes of the rotationally equivalent @xmath3 parameterizations , in other words the parameterizations referring to the same real crystal - field potential , but expressed in variously oriented reference frame .",
    "interestingly , the new invariants turn out to be the average values of the axial parameter modulus @xmath30 , @xmath2 , in the case of @xmath21 , or @xmath31 for the global @xmath3 obtained after the averaging over all orientations of the reference frame , i.e. over the solid angle @xmath32 . as it is shown in the paper",
    "the average value of the axial parameter modulus or the average of the modulus of their sum are just equal to @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively ( section 4 ) .",
    "the new scale of the crystal - field strength based on the above invariants is in principle consistent with the conventional one but it reveals more resolving power . applying the new measure to the iso - modular parametrizations may lead to different strength parameters what is exemplified below for several cases ( section 5 ) .",
    "the introduced more subtle strength gradation established rather on the first moment of the sublevel energy modules gives , comparing to the second moment , additional information about the stark levels array for various iso - modular @xmath3s , including the magnitude of the total splitting gap of the states . in this paper",
    "we confine ourselves to the pure model states of the zero - order approximation with a well defined angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding degeneration",
    ". these could be for instance russell - saunders coupled states @xmath35 coming from the @xmath36l terms , where @xmath37 stands for the remaining quantum numbers needed for their complete determination .",
    "such states have a well defined quantum number @xmath38 and the degeneration @xmath39 .",
    "the derivation of the analogical expressions including @xmath38-mixing effects [ 4 ] or a transformation to other functional bases of the zero - order approximation can be accomplished by using standard angular momentum re - coupling techniques [ 4 - 8 ] . in section 5",
    "we analyse by way of example the crystal - field splitting of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 one - electron configurations and a typical complex state @xmath43 for various iso - modular @xmath44 , @xmath2 . in the first three cases we avoid complex states re - coupling procedure which is a side issue to the problem under consideration .",
    "since we study the differentiation of the effects due to various iso - modular hamiltonians @xmath44 , all cfps values along with the stark levels energies are given in @xmath28 units .",
    "the comparison and scaling of the crystal - field impact can be based upon the two types of scalar quantities , @xmath28 and/or @xmath29 , since both of them are rotationally invariant .",
    "a scalar crystal - field strength parameter of this kind was given firstly by auzel and malta [ 1,2 ] as ( in original notation ) : @xmath45^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is nothing more but @xmath29 in the space spanned by spherical harmonics @xmath46 .",
    "in other words , @xmath47 is a norm representing a distance in the space .",
    "currently there are two definitions widely used in the literature [ 9 - 12 ] : @xmath48\\right\\}^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the case of @xmath7-pole @xmath3 component and @xmath51^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the global @xmath52 [ 4 ] .",
    "a word of caution seems to be worthy at this point .",
    "namely , the values of @xmath16 or @xmath17 can differ according to the type of the @xmath3 parametrization ( operators ) applied .",
    "they can be compared with each other only after proper recalculation . since both these quantities are independent of the assumed axis system they allow to check whether the original cfp data sets and the transformed ones are compatible .",
    "the strengths @xmath16 or @xmath17 enable also a broad comparison of cfp data sets when the axis systems have not been explicitly defined , and undoubtedly they play a central role in the cf theory .",
    "what is also important and useful they are linked to the second moment of the stark levels within a particular initial state @xmath53 [ 4,13 ] .",
    "the second moment of the sublevels @xmath54 within @xmath53 state upon introduction of a @xmath6 perturbation is defined by @xmath55^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the center of gravity of the stark levels belonging to the state @xmath53 is given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the @xmath54 sublevel energy . since @xmath3 is diagonal in the @xmath54 basis and the second order effect of @xmath3 interaction is neglected [ 4 ] @xmath58 hence @xmath59 what implies from the orthogonality of 3-@xmath60 symbols [ 2,5,13 ] .",
    "the symbols @xmath61 are the double - bar or reduced matrix elements of the spherical tensor operators . according to wigner - eckart theorem [ 14 ]",
    "they are independent of the reference frame orientation . their origin and physical meaning stem from the following relationships [ 5 - 8,15 ] : @xmath62 where the reduced matrix element follows the 3-@xmath60 factor .",
    "further use of tensor formalism yields @xmath63^{1/2}\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc }                    j & j^{\\prime } & k \\\\",
    "l^{\\prime } & l & s \\\\",
    "\\end{array}\\right\\ } \\langle\\alpha sl||c^{(k)}||\\alpha sl^{\\prime}\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the double - reduced matrix element follows now the 6-@xmath60 symbol .",
    "we can also pass to the matrix elements of the unit operators @xmath64 [ 5 - 8,15 ] , i.e. normalized equivalents of @xmath65 , since @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the angular momentum quantum number of the open - shell electrons .",
    "the reduced matrix elements of the @xmath64 operators have been compiled by nielson and koster [ 16 ] , whereas the 3-@xmath60 and 6-@xmath60 symbols can be found in the tables by rotenberg et al [ 7 ] .    the simple relation between the @xmath19 and @xmath23 ( eq.4 )",
    "can be also proved employing vieta s formulas for roots of the @xmath44 matrix characteristic polynomial @xmath68 which is here of order of @xmath69 .",
    "all its coefficients and roots must be real what follows obviously from the @xmath3 hermiticity .",
    "interestingly , some characteristics of the sublevels spectrum may be described in terms of the elementary algebra .",
    "firstly , as the energy center of gravity of the initial state is conserved , i.e. @xmath70 , the @xmath71 coefficient standing at @xmath72 must vanish .",
    "next , since @xmath73 , the second moment , i.e. the sum of the root squares ( divided by @xmath39 ) is equal to @xmath74 .",
    "it can be also shown that @xmath75 where the simplified notation for the reduced matrix element representing only the last quantum number has been introduced .",
    "hence , between @xmath19 and @xmath23 a simple formula holds ( eq.4 ) @xmath76 in other words , @xmath77 is proportional to @xmath16 . finally , a free term of the characteristic polynomial is given as @xmath78 , what may be helpful analyzing the solutions .",
    "for instance , if one root equals zero then a free term vanishes .",
    "the problem becomes more complex for the global crystal - field strength @xmath17",
    "( eq.2 ) , since then the components @xmath23 contribute to the sum with their weights @xmath79 ( eq.4 ) .",
    "this is why there is no straightforward proportionality between @xmath20 and @xmath24 in this case .",
    "nevertheless @xmath80 is a positively defined quadratic form of @xmath16 and , in consequence , the inputs of particular @xmath81 @xmath7-poles into @xmath20 can not compensate themselves .",
    "the condition that @xmath20 is constant for various iso - modular @xmath3 does not exclude , however , a possible differentiation of the cf sublevels sequence and structure , as well as the initial state total splitting .",
    "in fact , @xmath80 and @xmath17 could be correlated similarly as @xmath77 and @xmath16 in the previous case , only if the elements @xmath82 were equal for all @xmath14 .",
    "nevertheless , the second moment of the stark levels within a particular state @xmath53 is simply given in terms of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "auzel and malta [ 2 ] made an attempt to average the @xmath20 quadratic form by bringing down its respective ellipsoid @xmath86 in the @xmath14-space to a sphere of the same volume @xmath87^{1/3}$ ] and having a radius equal to the geometric mean of the three ellipsoid axes . in practice ,",
    "unfortunately , this elegant approach does not always lead to acceptable results . in the literature",
    "the overall effect of the crystal - field interaction is often characterized by a quantitative comparison of the crystal - field strength [ 17 - 20 ] . additionally , a systematic correlation between the free ion parameters and the cf strength is observed , namely increase of the crystal - field interaction results in the reduction of the free - ion parameters [ 17 ] . the cf strength increases in the re series with decreasing ionic radius of the re@xmath18 host cation [ 19 ]",
    "the physical meaning of the cf strength scalar parameter is also supported by the fact that it rises with pressure applied to a sample [ 21,22 ] .",
    "the cf strength parameter has also been used to compare the root mean square error obtained for crystal fields of different strength .",
    "however , its use in such a case is restricted only to comparisons of the identical site symmetries [ 10,23 ] .",
    "furthermore , within the approximation to the second order in the crystal - field , the shift in the center of gravity of a particular @xmath88 state due to @xmath38-mixing effects is a simple linear function of the @xmath23 [ 4,17 ] .",
    "the concept of the @xmath23 or @xmath17 can be extended to define the quantities @xmath89 and @xmath90 [ 13 ] as normalized `` scalar products '' of any two compared parametrizations .",
    "these quantities represent the `` angles '' between the two considered parametrizations and are a convenient measure of the closeness , i.e. the correlation of any two cfps sets .",
    "the second moment of cf levels , @xmath20 , essentially limits a formally allowed range of the initial state @xmath91 total splittings @xmath92 for different but iso - modular @xmath3s .",
    "such energy splitting confinement differs for non - kramers and kramers ions what is specified in details below .",
    "let us firstly study the case of any integer @xmath38 , i.e. non - kramers ions .",
    "having to keep a constant @xmath20 the minimal hypothetical splitting @xmath93 of the @xmath94-fold degenerate state takes place when @xmath38 levels assume identical energy of @xmath95 , and the remaining @xmath96 levels take the energy @xmath97 , or vice versa .",
    "further this is referred as type i splitting .",
    "then @xmath98 in turn , the maximal hypothetical splitting @xmath99 occurs for one level of @xmath100 energy , one of @xmath101 , and the rest @xmath102 levels with zero energy .",
    "further this is referred as type ii splitting",
    ". then @xmath103 and hence @xmath104 let us also consider , following auzel and malta [ 2 ] , the case of the homogenous splitting @xmath105 , when @xmath106 below it will be referred as type iii splitting .",
    "for example , if @xmath107 then @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and finally the ratio @xmath111 .    for @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "the ratio @xmath115 and this narrow interval strictly limits the @xmath92 variation .",
    "it has a simple graphical interpretation .",
    "as is known , three real roots of a third order equation must fulfill the conditions ( cardan s formulas ) presented in fig.1a , where the angle @xmath116 is a function of the equation coefficients .",
    "the maximal and minimal splittings @xmath92 correspond to the solutions shown in figs 1b and 1c , respectively .",
    "let us now pass to the kramers ions with a half integer @xmath38 . here , two cases should be analyzed .",
    "firstly , if an even number of doublets @xmath117 occurs the minimal @xmath91 state splitting takes place when @xmath118 doublets have the energy @xmath119 , and the next @xmath118 doublets the energy @xmath120 .",
    "then , @xmath121\\left(\\delta { \\cal e}_{\\rm min}/2\\right)^2}{2j+1 } , \\qquad \\qquad    \\delta { \\cal e}_{\\rm min}=2\\sigma.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in turn , the maximal splitting , @xmath99 , will appear if one of the doublets will be of energy @xmath122 , and the second one of energy @xmath101 with all the rest of levels with zero energy .",
    "this time @xmath123 and therefore now @xmath124    secondly , for an odd number of kramers doublets @xmath125 and @xmath126 , with @xmath127 .    the homogenous splitting @xmath128 for an even number of doublets @xmath129 and for an odd number of doublets @xmath130 , where @xmath131 , amounts correspondingly to @xmath132 and @xmath133 . by way of example , if @xmath134 ( i.e. for five doublets ) , then @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 . in the case of kramers ions",
    "the @xmath92 variation range turns out to be smaller than that for non - kramers ions , which is seen comparing the @xmath93 and @xmath99 for @xmath107 and @xmath134 .",
    "finally , taking the most extreme case of @xmath138 for @xmath139-electron configurations ( e.g. for dy@xmath18 , er@xmath18 ) with eight doublets , we would obtain @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 .",
    "rotating the reference frame by the two euler angles @xmath37 and @xmath147 we obtain all the equivalent @xmath6 parametrizations ( with the accuracy to the third euler angle @xmath148 about the @xmath149 axis ) [ 5,24 ] .",
    "their axial parameters for a @xmath7-pole component are given as : @xmath150 where @xmath151 are the middle row rotation matrix elements , @xmath152 are the spherical tensors , whereas @xmath153^{1/2}p_{k}^{q}(\\cos\\beta)$ ] , and @xmath154 are the associated legendre functions , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 .",

    "it can be directly proved that @xmath157 and @xmath158 , while the average absolute values @xmath159 as the rotational group invariants are discriminants of the equivalent parametrizations classes [ 24 ] . by the mean value",
    "we understand the magnitude averaged over all possible orientations of the reference frame , i.e. over the solid angle @xmath32 .",
    "interestingly , they can be used to estimate the cf strength independently of the parametrization modulus .    [",

    "this identity , eq.12 , obvious when we properly interpret the rotation angles in both cases of averaging , associates @xmath165 with the complementary measure of the cf strength @xmath166 : @xmath167 although the expression for @xmath166 in the above form is limited to a given @xmath7-pole @xmath8 component , it may be generalized for the global @xmath3 @xmath168 contrary to the conventional cf strengths @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( eqs 1,2 ) , which are constant for all the iso - modular parametrizations , the new strengths @xmath166 and @xmath169 calculated for the constant modulus ( and modules ) change their magnitudes within certain ranges discussed in the next section . to compare both the measures it is convenient to express @xmath166 in the product form @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is a specified factor .",
