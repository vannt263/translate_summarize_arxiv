    "perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) provides a powerful method to calculate the hard processes with large momentum transfers @xmath1 from the first principle @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient of pqcd is factorization , which separates short - distance dynamics from the long - distance physics .",
    "recently , an effective filed theory for soft and collinear particles were proposed in a series of studies @xcite .",
    "the proof of the factorization theorem in the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) can be performed at the operator level which is much simpler than the diagrammatic analysis in pqcd .",
    "it also provides a new framework to study the resummation of sudakov double - logs and the power corrections .",
    "the scet is divided into scet@xmath2 and scet@xmath0 according to the momentum of the collinear particles .",
    "it is convenient to use the light - cone coordinates @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two light - like vectors which satisfy @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for the process where the off - shellness of the collinear particle @xmath8 , the soft particle belongs to ultrasoft mode .",

    "the theory of describing the collinear and ultrasoft fields is called scet@xmath2 . for the processes where the off - shellness of the collinear particle @xmath12 , the soft particle belongs to soft mode .",
    "the momenta of the collinear and soft particles are scaled as @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the scet@xmath0 aims to describe the collinear and soft fields .",
    "the construction of the scet@xmath0 is considered more complicated than the scet@xmath2 because the momentum of the collinear particle does not retain its scaling when a soft particle couples to it .",
    "a view about the scet@xmath0 is that it can be considered as a low energy effective theory of scet@xmath2 and is obtained from the the scet@xmath2 by integrating out the @xmath16 fluctuations . according to this view of point , in the leading order of @xmath17 ,",
    "there is no coupling of soft to collinear particles in the scet@xmath0 .",
    "however , the above arguments of excluding the interaction between the collinear and soft particles ( in the leading order ) are insufficient . recalling that in the heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite",
    ", although the off - shellness of a heavy quark @xmath18 is at a large intermediate scale , the leading order hqet lagrangian is given by the interaction of the heavy quark and soft gluons as @xmath19 .",
    "the leading order interaction of the collinear quark and soft gluon had been proposed in the framework of the large - energy - effective - theory ( leet ) @xcite .",
    "the leet was criticized by lacking the collinear gluon degrees of freedom in the development of the scet . because the interactions of the collinear quark and soft gluon in the leet is not contradict to any physical principle , another way of constructing the scet@xmath0",
    "can be done by adding the collinear gluon into the leet .",
    "this is our proposal .",
    "the construction of the interactions of the collinear quark and soft gluons in the leading order at the lagrangian level is more transparent and it is easier to be extended to higher orders",
    ".    we will study the quark form factor in the asymptotic limit in the scet@xmath0 .",
    "first , we will show that the scet@xmath0 reproduce the ir physics of qcd for the quark form factor at one - loop order .",
    "then we use the scet@xmath0 to give a factorized form for the quark form factor in the asymptotic limit .",
    "another motivation of this study is to explore the proof of factorization by using the position space representation of scet . in the position space representation",
    ", one can use the conventional definition of the universal non - perturbative quantities . as an example",
    ", we discuss the factorization proof in deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering ( dis ) process .",
    "it is convenient to use the light - cone coordinates to study the processes which contain highly energetic light hadrons or jets .",
    "an arbitrary four - vector @xmath20 is written as p^=(p^+ , p^- , p_)=n_-p+ n_+p+p_^ , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are two light - like vectors which satisfy @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "we discuss a case that all collinear particles move close to @xmath23 direction , i.e. , the momentum @xmath24 is large at first for the simplification of illustration .",
    "other cases can be similarly obtained .",
    "a four - component dirac field @xmath25 can be decomposed into two - component spinors @xmath26 and @xmath27 by = + ,   p_-= ,  p_+=. with @xmath28 .",
    "we will consider the effective theory for massless quarks because the mass of the light @xmath29 quarks are much smaller than the qcd confinement scale @xmath30 .",
    "the massless qcd lagrangian @xmath31 is[eq : qcd1 ] l=|  in_-d  +    @xmath32 .    as we have discussed in the introduction",
    ", the scet@xmath0 describes the degrees of freedom of the collinear and soft fields .",
    "the momenta for the collinear and soft particles are scaled as @xmath9 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the power counting for the relevant fields can be found in @xcite : the collinear quark field @xmath33 ; the collinear gluon field : @xmath34 ; the soft quark field : @xmath35 ; the soft gluon field : @xmath36 .",
    "now , we follow the construction of the leet given in @xcite and then transform it into the position space representation . after the interactions with the soft gluon ,",
    "the momentum of the collinear quark is changed into @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the residual momentum carried by the soft gluons .",
    "thus , the scaling of the integral element is @xmath39 rather than @xmath40 .",
    "analogous to the hqet , we remove the large momentum component @xmath41 by redefining the collinear quark field as @xmath42 $ ] . after integrating out the small - component field @xmath43 , one",

    "the previous obstruction of constructing the leading order interaction of the collinear quark with soft gluons in the scet@xmath0 lies in the different scaling of momenta @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in the above analysis",

    "the @xmath47 field is a collinear field rather than a soft field like the heavy quark field @xmath54 .",

    "the off - shellness of @xmath53 does not invalidate our assumption .",

    ", the information of the off - shellness cause by @xmath55 can be included in the soft wilson line , so the construction of the leading order effective lagrange is equivalent to the use of the soft wilson line .",
    "the advantage of our proposal is that it permits us to write down not only the leading order term but also the higher order terms systematically .    transforming the above analysis into the position space formulation",

    "we will use the collinear wilson line in the proof of factorization below .",
    "the scet contains rich symmetry structures . except the symmetries which had been studied largely in the literatures , we discuss a new symmetry : scale symmetry",
    "however , this symmetry is not rigorous but approximate .",
    "it is broken by the renormalization effect and quark mass . in the scet@xmath0",
    ", the light quark mass is approximated to zero . in most high energy hard processes ,",
    "the broken of the scale symmetry is caused by the perturbative corrections occurred at the scale of @xmath64 which is suppressed by the coupling constant @xmath65 .",
    "if neglecting the perturbative corrections , the scale symmetry can be a useful guide .",

    "we choose the transition form factor rather than the annihilation form factor in order to avoid the unimportant imaginary part .",
    "we study the case that the collinear quarks are both on - shell .",
    "the momenta of quarks a and b are chosen as @xmath69 and @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a large energy scale .",
    "the one - loop order qcd corrections to the quark transition form factor contain the quark self - energy and the vertex corrections .",

    "we will not consider them below .",
    "the one - loop vertex correction depicted in fig .",
    "1 contains the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences as well as the collinear and soft divergences .",
    "the collinear divergence appears when the virtual gluon becomes collinear to quark a or b. one may use the quark mass and a fictitious mass for gluon field to regulate the ir singularities .",
    "the problem of this regularization method is that it is insufficient to regulate all the singularities in the effective theory .",
    "we will use the regularization method proposed in @xcite because it simplifies the calculation .",
    "the ir regulator is given by adding new terms in the lagrangian : l_reg= -a_+(in_- )",
    "a^_+ -a_s(in_- ) a^_s + ( + - ) . where @xmath72 represents the gluon collinear to the a quark .",
    "the appearance of the additional terms @xmath73 is because there are two collinear quarks with different directions in our process .",
    "we use the dimensional regularization to regulate the uv divergences and perform the calculation in @xmath74 dimension . the one - loop vertex correction in the full theory plotted in fig",

    "is performed by using the method of regions @xcite .",
    "the idea is expanding the integrand @xmath77 in the momentum regions which give contributions in dimensional regularization . in the quark form factor ,",

    "they also constitute the results in the sect@xmath0 exactly .",

    "thus , the ir physics of the quark form factor is reproduced in the scet@xmath0 and the non - ir physics ( it refers to the perturbative part in pqcd ) is contained in the hard region contribution .",
    "after the proof that scet@xmath0 reproduces the ir physics of the quark form factor in the full theory , we can use the effective theory to give a factorization form .",
    "the advantage of using the scet to study factorization is that we can use the operator language rather than diagram analysis and the proof to all orders can be done simply .",

    "the contributions of different regions ( except for the hard region ) are corresponding parts in the scet .",
    "after we have checked that scet produces all the ir physics of the full theory , we can use the operator language in scet in place of the diagrammatic analysis to simplify the all - orders proof of factorization .",

    "the authors apply the scet@xmath2 to study the inclusive dis process .",
    "this view is not rigorous .",
    "which sect theory is used as the final effective theory of a process depends on the momentum of collinear particle . in dis ,",
    "the proton and the collinear quark inside the proton have the virtuality of order of @xmath30 , so the correct theory needed is scet@xmath0 rather than scet@xmath2 .",

    "one can obtain the structure functions through the projecting of hadronic tensor by [ eq : projection]n_+^n_+^w_=f_2 ,   n_-^n_-^w_=f_2-f_1 . in the quark form factor ,",
    "the leading contributions come from the hard , collinear and soft regions . for dis",
    ", the soft divergences are cancelled due to the unitarity of wilson line @xmath112 .",
    "the collinear quarks are moving in the same direction in dis which is different from the case in the quark form factor .",
    "so , there is no soft factor appeared in the factorization form in leading order .",
