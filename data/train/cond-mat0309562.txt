    "analytical studies of dynamic critical phenomena in the vicinity of a second - order phase transition usually rely on a coupled set of langevin - type stochastic equations of motion for the relevant slow variables , namely the order parameter and hydrodynamic modes associated with conservation laws @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the separation of time scales induced by critical slowing down , all remaining microscopic degrees of freedom are reduced to additive gaussian white noise terms in this description . in order to guarantee that the probability distribution for any configuration converges to the canonical gibbs function @xmath10 at long times @xmath11 ( with the effective hamiltonian @xmath12 usually taken to be the standard @xmath13 model )",
    ", the second moments of the stochastic forces must be related to the relaxation rates via einstein relations .",
    "in addition , integrability conditions constrain the reversible force terms in the nonlinear langevin equations quite severely , for the associated probability currents in the space of the slow variables must be divergence - free @xcite .",
    "these two requirements also ensure the validity of the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation theorem which relates the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibilities with the correlation functions . as a consequence ,",
    "the system s static behavior can be separated from its dynamic properties .    in isotropic systems",
    ", there are normally two independent static critical exponents , e.g. , @xmath14 and @xmath15 which respectively characterize the divergence of the correlation length upon approaching the transition , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , and govern the power - law decay of the two - point correlation function at @xmath18 , @xmath19 in @xmath20 spatial dimensions .",
    "these become supplemented by dynamic exponents @xmath21 that describe the critical slowing down for the relevant modes , with characteristic relaxation times diverging as @xmath22 . at thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the dynamic universality classes are well understood , and known to be distinguished by overall features of the dynamical system at hand .",
    "in addition to the order parameter symmetry which essentially dictates the static critical exponents , the determining factors are if the order parameter itself represents a conserved quantity or not , the absence or presence of additional conservation laws , and the form of the reversible mode couplings between the generalized hydrodynamic variables , as again dictated by the symmetries of the problem @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , critical dynamics in systems far from thermal equilibrium is not subject to the stringent limitations imposed by the detailed balance constraints , and in fact can not even always be adequately captured through coarse - grained stochastic equations of motion @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , several important situations have been successfully modeled by means of the langevin formalism , two prominent examples being driven ising lattice gases , or more general driven diffusive systems @xcite , and nonequilibrium interface growth models , such as captured by the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation and its variants @xcite .",
    "yet in nonequilibrium circumstances one has to invoke heuristic and/or phenomenological arguments for choosing the mathematical form of the noise correlations .",
    "this must be done with appropriate care , however , since the structure of the stochastic forces may crucially impact the universal scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "it is thus of vital importance to elucidate the influence of different forms of the assumed stochastic noise correlations on the long - distance and long - time properties of any nonequilibrium langevin system under investigation .",
    "naturally then , the following question arises for the langevin models describing the equilibrium dynamical universality classes : what happens to their universal scaling behavior if the detailed balance conditions are violated ?",
    "notice that since ` static ' properties can not be decoupled from the dynamics in nonequilibrium steady states , this may include novel static critical behavior as well in addition to perhaps modified values for the dynamic exponents @xmath21 .",
    "the simplest dynamical model just entails a purely relaxational kinetics for a nonconserved order parameter with no coupling to other conserved quantities .",
    "this defines model a in the ( alphabetical ) classification of ref .",
    "@xcite . yet the model a universality class , as for example realized in the kinetic ising model with glauber spin flip dynamics , is known to be extremely robust against nonequilibrium perturbations @xcite . for the kinetic ising model ,",
    "this remains true even when the order parameter up - down symmetry is broken @xcite .",
    "consider the most straightforward situation where the order parameter symmetry remains preserved , but the einstein relation is not satisfied . since there is only a single stochastic equation of motion in this case , one can recover detailed balance through simple parameter rescaling which does not affect universal properties at the phase transition @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the situation is markedly different for the purely diffusive relaxational critical dynamics of model b with _ conserved _ order parameter ( e.g. , the kinetic ising model with kawasaki spin exchange processes ) , but only when subject to spatially _ anisotropic _ noise , say with stronger noise correlations in the thus defined longitudinal as compared to the complementary transverse sector in momentum space . in this",
    "effective _ two - temperature _ or _ randomly driven model b _ , excitations in the transverse sector soften first , while the longitudinal directions remain noncritical @xcite .",
    "this induces inherent anisotropic scaling at the critical point , of the same form as those in driven lattice gases @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the emerging long - wavelength dynamics in the critical regime can be recast into an equilibrium model b , albeit with an effective hamiltonian that incorporates long - range interactions of the uniaxial dipolar or ferroelastic type .",
    "these reduce both the lower critical dimension , allowing long - range order already in one dimension , as well as the upper critical dimension to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the dimension of the stiff longitudinal sector @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the associated _ four _ independent critical exponents ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath21 , and the anisotropy exponent @xmath25 ) were computed to two - loop order in the @xmath26 expansion ( @xmath27 ) by means of the dynamic renormalization group ( rg ) , utilizing a path integral or dynamic field theory representation of the langevin equation @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium dynamical models c and d ( in the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite ) still describe purely relaxational dynamics for either a nonconserved ( model c ) or conserved ( model d ) @xmath0-component order parameter field @xmath1 , which is however _ statically _ coupled to the conserved scalar energy density @xmath2 @xcite . preserving the @xmath28 order parameter symmetry ,",
    "the lowest - order coupling is @xmath29 .",
    "as the energy density itself represents a noncritical variable entering the hamiltonian only quadratically , it can be integrated out exactly in the partition function @xmath30 and the generating function for static correlations .",
    "this merely shifts the value of the fourth - order coupling @xmath31 for the order parameter fluctuations , whence one recovers the static critical exponents of the @xmath28 model .",
    "the coupling to the scalar diffusive mode @xmath2 may however alter the _ dynamic _ critical behavior .",
    "to one - loop order , three distinct scaling regimes emerge for model c with nonconserved order parameter , depending on the component number @xmath0 @xcite : ( a ) for ising symmetry ( @xmath32 ) , one finds ` strong ' scaling , i.e. , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes the specific heat critical exponent ; ( b ) the interval @xmath35 , for which @xmath36 , is characterized by ` weak ' scaling with @xmath37 ; ( c ) for @xmath5 , where @xmath38 , the langevin equations for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 effectively decouple , leaving purely diffusive behavior for the conserved mode , @xmath39 , and the model a dynamic critical exponent for the order parameter , @xmath40 , with @xmath41 . to higher orders in perturbation theory ,",
    "these three regimes essentially persist ( yet there appear additional distinctions with respect to the corrections to the leading scaling laws ) , but their boundaries become functions of the spatial dimension @xmath20 as well as of @xmath0 @xcite . for model d with conserved order parameter , the energy density always fluctuates faster in the critical region , rendering a strong - scaling regime impossible .",
    "the order parameter dynamics is thus not affected by the additional conservation law , and given by the model b dynamic critical exponent @xmath42 . for @xmath36 ,",
    "one finds again @xmath43 , whereas @xmath39 in the decoupled case when @xmath44 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the effect of perturbations in the stochastic force correlators that violate the equilibrium conditions on the critical dynamics of the relaxational models c and d. specifically , we shall retain the @xmath28 order parameter symmetry , but introduce different noise correlation strengths for the critical fluctuations and the conserved energy density , respectively , amounting to unequal effective heat bath temperatures @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we shall employ the dynamic rg to one - loop order , and search for novel nonequilibrium fixed points of the ensuing rg flow equations .",
    "in addition , we will investigate spatially anisotropic detailed balance violations .",
    "the critical dynamics at structural phase transitions and of anisotropic antiferromagnets are usually listed as possible realizations of the model c universality class @xcite . in the latter case , the nonequilibrium system studied in this paper might be accessible experimentally if the effective temperature of the conserved magnetization component(s ) can be maintained at a value different from that of the staggered magnetization which constitutes the nonconserved order parameter , perhaps through constant exposure to electromagnetic radiation .",
    "this work supplements earlier research that focused on nonequilibrium perturbations for dynamic universality classes which are characterized by reversible mode couplings , as relevant for second - order phase transitions in magnetic systems @xcite ( models e , g , and j , respectively for the critical dynamics in planar ferromagnets , isotropic antiferromagnets , and heisenberg ferromagnets ) as well as in fluids @xcite ( model h for the liquid - gas transition critical point , or more generally in binary fluids , and model e for the normal- to superfluid phase transition ) . ref .",
    "@xcite provides a concise summary of the results of these investigations ( including a subset of this present work ) .",
    "we finally remark that a recent study has addressed a _",
    "nonlocal _ generalization of the equilibrium relaxational models that allows interpolating between the scaling laws of models a , b , and c @xcite . intriguingly ,",
    "also a ` true model d ' scaling regime emerges in this situation , where both the conservation laws for the order parameter and the energy density remain relevant in the rg sense .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a derivation of the langevin equations of motion from the effective hamiltonian for models c and d , and then provide a brief outline of the construction of field theory and the perturbation expansion based on the dynamic action ( the janssen - de dominicis functional @xcite ) . prior to describing the results of the explicit perturbation expansion , the effect of the static nonlinear coupling of the order parameter to the conserved energy density is gauged by integrating the conserved field out of the dynamic action .",
    "the implications of this , namely the reduction of the isotropic nonequilibrium model d to its equilibrium counterpart , is discussed .",
    "subsequently , the full renormalization of the vertex functions ( calculated to one - loop order ) is detailed and the expressions for the resulting renormalization constants are presented . from these @xmath47 factors",
    "we obtain the rg flow equations , and therefrom calculate the static and dynamic critical exponents first in equilibrium , and then successively allowing for isotropic violation of detailed balance in both models d and c. the @xmath47 factors are then adapted for the case of dynamical anisotropy in model c ; its fixed point and critical behavior is explained . finally ,",
    "following earlier work on the two - temperature model b @xcite , the anisotropic nonequilibrium model d is recast into an effective two - temperature model d with anisotropic scaling properties .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary , putting our results into context with earlier investigations .",
    "an appendix lists the explicit expressions for the one - loop vertex functions .",
    "in this section , we outline the basic model equations for the nonequilibrium generalization of the relaxational models c and d. as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , these models are characterized by a @xmath0-component vector order parameter @xmath48 , coupled to a scalar conserved field @xmath2 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian that describes their equilibrium static critical properties is the @xmath28-symmetric @xmath13 landau - ginzburg - wilson free energy in @xmath20 space dimensions , with additional terms for the noncritical conserved field and its coupling to the order parameter .",

    "<S> similar to the two - temperature model b ( randomly driven diffusive systems ) the effective theory at criticality can be cast into an equilibrium model d dynamics , albeit incorporating long - range interactions of the uniaxial dipolar or ferroelastic type . </S>"
