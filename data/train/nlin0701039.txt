    "the derivative nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnlse ) ( @xmath1 ) @xmath2 has many physical applications , and , probably , the most important are in plasma physics and in nonlinear optic . first , equation ( [ main ] ) describes modulated small - amplitude nonlinear alfvn waves in a low-@xmath3 ( the ratio of kinetic to magnetic pressure ) plasma , propagating parallel @xcite or at a small angle @xcite to the ambient magnetic field .",
    "the dnls equation also describes large - amplitude magnetohydrodynamic waves in a high-@xmath3 plasma , propagating at an arbitrary angle to the ambient magnetic field @xcite . in these cases @xmath4 denotes the transverse magnetic field perturbation normalized by the ambient magnetic field , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are normalized time and space coordinates , respectively .",
    "second , the dnlse is related to the modified nonlinear schrdinger equation ( mnlse ) @xmath7 by a simple gaugelike transformation @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 corresponds to the abnormal ( normal ) group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) region , @xmath10 , @xmath11 . in turn",
    ", the mnlse describes the propagation of ultrashort femtosecond nonlinear pulses in optical fibers , when the spectral width of the pulses becomes comparable with the carrier frequency , and , in addition to the usual kerr nonlinearity , the effect of self - steepening of the pulse should be taken into account . in this case",
    ", @xmath4 is the normalized slowly varying amplitude of the complex field envelope , @xmath5 is the normalized propagation distance along the fiber , and @xmath6 is the normalized time measured in a frame of reference moving with the pulse at the group velocity .    equation ( [ main ] ) is completed by the boundary conditions : vanishing ( @xmath12 as @xmath13 ) or nonvanishing ( @xmath14 as @xmath13 ) at infinity . in both cases",
    "the dnlse is integrable by the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) @xcite , and admits @xmath0-soliton solutions @xcite .",
    "the nonvanishing boundary conditions ( nvbc ) are important in physical applications .",
    "for example , in space plasma physics the vanishing boundary conditions ( vbc ) are relevant only for the case of propagation of alfvn waves strictly parallel to the ambient magnetic field . in nonlinear optics",
    "the nvbc can support propagation of dark solitons in both normal and abnormal gvd regions @xcite .",
    "unlike the nonlinear schrdinger equation or the dnlse with vbc , the dnlse with nvbc admits simultaneous generation of breathers ( solitons with internal oscillations ) and one - parametric ( nonoscillating ) bright and/or dark solitons @xcite .",
    "the ist formalism for the dnlse with nvbc is much more complicated from the one for vbc .",
    "analytical properties of the jost solutions in this case are formulated on the riemann sheets of the spectral parameter @xcite and the corresponding direct and inverse scattering problems are rather involved .",
    "recently , chen and lam @xcite developed the ist for the dnlse with nvbc by introducing an affine parameter to avoid constructing the riemann sheets . both approaches , however , encounter a difficulty when finding exact explicit @xmath0-soliton solutions .",
    "the reason is that the resulting solution @xmath4 containes the phase factor @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is some definite integral from @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the solution is written in an implicit form and only modulus of the solution can be obtained in that way .",
    "though for simple one - parametric soliton solutions the phase @xmath16 can be calculated by direct integration , this procedure is obviously impracticable for @xmath0-soliton solutions .",
    "instead , tricks leading to the explicit expression for @xmath16 were used in some particular cases : for the two - parametric one - soliton breather solution @xcite , and for the @xmath0-soliton with purely imaginary discrete spectral parameters ( i. e. for pure bright and/or dark solitons ) @xcite . another approach based on darboux / bclund transformations",
    "was developed by steudel @xcite .",
    "apparently , steudel was the first to obtain exact @xmath0-soliton solutions with explicitly calculated phases for the dnlse with nvbc .    from the practical point of view , the completely integrable dnlse ( [ main ] ) is an idealized model .",
    "in many physical applications , additional terms are often present in the dnlse .",
    "they can include effects of the third - order linear dispersion , dissipation , influence of external forces , etc . .",
    "these terms violate the integrability , but being small in many important practical cases , they can be taken into account by perturbation theory .",
    "the most powerful perturbative technique , which fully uses the natural separation of the discrete and continuous ( i.e. , solitonic and radiative ) degrees of freedom of the unperturbed dnlse , is based on the ist .",
    "while the ist - based perturbation theory for the dnlse with vbc was developed long ago @xcite , the analogous theory for nonvanishing boundary conditions was absent .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we present a relatively simple approach for finding exact explicit ( i. e. with the phase ) @xmath18-soliton ( @xmath0 breathers and @xmath19 `` usual '' bright and/or dark solitons in asymptotics ) solutions of the dnlse with nvbc and show that these solutions can be obtained without determining the phase factor @xmath15 .",
    "thus , exact exotic solutions , describing , for instance , collisions between breathers , as well as collisions between pure bright / dark solitons and breathers can be written . simultaneously , unlike the purely algebraic approach @xcite based on darboux transformation , the corresponding jost solutions can also be obtained .",
    "a second aim is to present perturbation theory for solitons of the dnlse with nvbc .",
    "we derive evolution equations for the scattering data ( both solitonic and continuous ) in the presence of perturbations . as an application of the present theory we consider the action of the diffusive - type perturbation on a single bright / dark soliton .    without loss of generality",
    ", we will consider the nvbc in the form @xmath20 we also put @xmath21 , since the case @xmath22 can be obtained from the former by a transformation @xmath23 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we review a theory of the scattering transform for the dnlse with nvbc . in section 3",
    ", we present the procedure to construct the general explicit @xmath18-soliton solution .",
    "integrals of motion are obtained in section 4 . the perturbation theory and its application",
    "are considered in sections 5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "the conclusion is made in section 7 .",
    "in this section we present the theory of the scattering transform for the dnlse with nvbc , following @xcite with some modifications and specifications .",

    "( [ spec1 ] ) are formulated on the riemann surface determined by the function @xmath34 .",
    "the riemann surface @xmath35 consists of two sheets @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the complex @xmath26plane with branch cuts on the image axis from @xmath38 to @xmath39 and from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce an affine parameter @xmath42 by a change of variable @xcite @xmath43 this transformation maps the sheets @xmath44 onto @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively and the real axis on the complex @xmath26-plane into the real axis on the @xmath42-plane . under this , @xmath47 where the single - valued function @xmath48 is determined by @xmath49 for @xmath50 denote by @xmath51 the @xmath52 matrix jost solutions of ( [ spec1 ] ) , satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath53 the corresponding integral equation can be obtained from ( [ spec1 ] ) and ( [ bou ] ) @xmath54 the matrix jost solutions @xmath51 can be represented in the form @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are independent vector columns .",
    "the monodromy matrix @xmath59 relates the two fundamental solutions @xmath60 and @xmath61 : @xmath62 the jost coefficients are defined by @xmath63 so that the monodromy matrix is @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",

    "in addition , since the scattering problem ( [ spec1 ] ) possesses symmetry with respect to the inversion @xmath73 , the important involution properties are valid : @xmath74 it follows from ( [ s ] ) that @xmath75 where we have introduced the notation @xmath76 columns @xmath77 and @xmath78 turn out to be analytically continuable to @xmath79 ( i. e. to the first and the third quadrants of the complex @xmath42-plane ) , while @xmath80 and @xmath81 are analytically continuable to @xmath82 ( i. e. to the second and the fourth quadrants ) @xcite .",
    "then , the coefficient @xmath83 is analytically continuable to @xmath84 .",
    "the analytic function @xmath83 may have zeros @xmath85 in the region of its analyticity @xmath86 .",

    "first of all , as one can see in figure  [ fig2 ] , dark solitons turn out to be much more robust .",
    "next , if the initial @xmath3 exceeds the critical value @xmath174 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) , then the amplitude @xmath288 ( with respect to the background ) of the dark soliton first increases with time , reaches a maximum for @xmath174 , where @xmath289 , and finally decreases .",
    "we have presented a simple approach for finding @xmath0-soliton solution and the corresponding jost solutions of the dnlse with nvbc .",
    "it is important that the exact solutions can be obtained without explicit determining of the phase factor .",
    "the found one- and two - soliton solutions perfectly coincide with those obtained in @xcite , but , unlike @xcite , our method allows to get solutions describing collisions between breathers , as well as collisions between pure bright / dark solitons and breathers .",
    "we have also developed a perturbation theory based on the ist for perturbed dnlse solitons .",
    "this approach fully uses the natural separation of the discrete and continuous degrees of freedom of the unperturbed dnlse with nvbc .",
    "we have derived evolution equations for the scattering data ( both solitonic and continuous ) in the presence of perturbations . as an application of the developed theory",
    ", we considered ( in the adiabatic approximation ) the action of the diffusive - type perturbation on a single bright / dark soliton .",
