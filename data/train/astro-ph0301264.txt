    "vorticity generation in turbulent and laminar flows was studied experimentally , theoretically and numerically in a number of publications ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for instance , a mechanism of the vorticity production in laminar compressible fluid flows consists in the misalignment of pressure and density gradients @xcite .",

    "the role of small - scale vorticity production in incompressible turbulent flows was discussed in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , generation and dynamics of the mean vorticity are associated with turbulent secondary flows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these flows , e.g. , arise at the lateral boundaries of three - dimensional thin shear layers whereby longitudinal ( streamwise ) mean vorticity is generated by a lateral deflection or  skewing `` of an existing shear layer @xcite .",

    "streamwise mean vorticity can be generated by the reynolds stresses .",
    "the latter is prandtl s second kind of turbulent secondary flows , and it  has no counterpart in laminar flow and can not be described by any turbulence model with an isotropic eddy viscocity '' @xcite .    in the present study we demonstrated that in a homogeneous incompressible turbulent flow with an imposed mean velocity shear a large - scale instability can be excited which results in a mean vorticity production .",

    "the mean velocity shear can affect a turbulence .",
    "the reason is that additional strongly anisotropic velocity fluctuations can be generated by tangling of the mean - velocity gradients with the kolmogorov - type turbulence ( see fig .",
