    "schaap et al . 2000 ) revealed a thick layer of h  i rotating more slowly than the thin disk .",
    "this has led to the picture of spiral galaxies with a halo population of high velocity h  i. a few explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon , one of which is the galactic fountain mechanism with massive star formation and supernovae blowing the h  i into the halo .",
    "+ to investigate further the 3d picture of the anomalous h  i , we have observed with very high sensitivity with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope . is a large nearby spiral galaxy seen almost face - on and is known for its high star - formation rate .",
    "the h  i disk of shows a large number of holes ( see fig . 1 , top left panel ) and gas with velocities deviating 50 to 100 km / s from normal galactic rotation .",
    "the high velocity h  i is widespread and mostly located in the inner ( bright optical ) part of the disk ( see optical image in fig .",
    "1 ) , suggesting a close relation with the ongoing star formation and supernovae . the gas is probably brought into the halo by galactic fountains .",
    "+    in many cases in the inner disk there is a clear association between the high velocity gas and the holes ( fig .",
    "1 , bottom right panel ) where also many h  ii regions are located .",
    "however , high velocity h  i and holes are also found in the outer h  i layer of beyond the optical disk ( see fig .",
    "1 , bottom left panel ) , where very little or no star formation is present .",
    "star formation is unlikely to be the cause , so another mechanism is required .",
    "perhaps this is the result of infalling clouds onto the galaxy disk .",
