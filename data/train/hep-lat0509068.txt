    "the critical temperature @xmath4 can be parameterized as a function of the baryonic chemical potential @xmath47 as @xmath67 results for @xmath68 from various simulations are accumulated in table  [ tab : allc ] , which indicates that @xmath68 becomes larger as @xmath69 increases .",

    "[ tab : allc ]    one may convert the mass dependence of the critical endpoint to the @xmath1 dependence of the critical quark mass as @xmath71 where the critical quark mass separates the first order phase transition from the cross - over : the phase transition is the first order at @xmath72 while it becomes cross - over at @xmath73 . for the @xmath74 case , the imaginary chemical potential method@xcite , using the ks quark action , gives @xmath75 and @xmath76 , while the multi - parameter reweighting method with the taylor expansion@xcite , using the p4-improved ks quark action , leads to @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "although errors are large and quark actions are different , a discrepancy between two results is huge .",

    "the multi - parameter reweighting method agrees with the direct calculation , while the glasgow method does not .",
    "this comparison may suggest that the multi - parameter reweighting is more reliable . as mentioned in the previous subsection , however , the result must be symmetric in @xmath80 at @xmath81 .",
    "this symmetric property is clearly violated in both mult - parameter reweighting method and the direct calculation .",
    "it is likely that the violation may be caused by the insufficient statistics for both methods .",
    "therefore , in the case of the reweighting method , one should always check whether the symmetric property is satisfied or not for the imaginary chemical potential , using the same ensemble employed for the reweighting of real @xmath1 .",
    "it has been pointed out that the partition function becomes zero in the infinite volume limit for all @xmath82 : @xmath83 , due to the sign problem of the complex action@xcite .",
    "therefore one should check the volume dependence of not only the 1st lee - yang zero but also the 2nd , 3rd , @xmath84 lee - yang zeros , in order to distinguish the first order phase transition from the cross - over .",
    "in addition to the above subtlety , the procedure of taking @xmath85 limit@xcite may cause some systematic uncertainties in the estimation of the critical endpoint . for example , an extrapolation linear in @xmath86 gives i m @xmath87 at @xmath88 , suggesting that this point corresponds to the cross - over . as shown in the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] , however , the quadratic fit or the linear fit for larger 3 volumes gives i m @xmath89 or @xmath90 , respectively , concluding that the phase transition is consistent with the first order .",
    "clearly a more careful finite volume analysis is required for a definite conclusion on the location of the critical endpoint .",
    "by recent developments for lattice qcd techniques , numerical simulations become possible at small @xmath1 and non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "preliminary results suggest @xmath91 350  450 mev at physical light and strange quark masses",
    ". however further confirmations will be definitely required for the reliable estimate of @xmath92 .",
    "so far numerical simulations at non - zero @xmath1 have been performed only with ks fermions .",
    "therefore new calculations by other fermion formulations such as wilson / clover or domain - wall / overlap fermions will be necessary to check the present results by ks fermions . definitely new ideas will be needed to explore qcd phase structure at large @xmath1 and low @xmath0 .",
