    "in this section , we would like to give an intuitive picture as to why impurity sites in @xmath1 and @xmath2-wave superconductors can bind an impurity states ( the shiba states ) and why those sites can experience a topological transition , at which the parity of the many - body ground state changes . to this end , we consider the simplest noninteracting model of a single site and a pair of sites , respectively , but work in its many - body hilbert space .    in symmetry class @xmath154 ( applies to chiral @xmath2-wave superconductors ) the @xmath56 topological index of a 1d superconductor denotes the change in fermion parity of the ground - state as a flux @xmath155 is inserted through a system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this parity change can even be observed in zero - dimensional models of isolated impurities and provides basic intuition whether and how a 1d chain of scalar impurities has the potential to undergo a topological phase transition . here , we discuss this minimal model for a parity changing transition for one and two sites populated with spinless fermions and for a single site populated with spinful fermions .",
    "these trivial models provide insight into why in - gap shiba states can be present in scalar impurities placed in superconductors , complementing the more well known situation of shiba states occurring in magnetic impurities .",
    "a single spinless fermion can not exhibit superconducting pairing .",
    "irrespective of that , we see that an on - site chemical potential @xmath90 can change the parity @xmath156 of the ground state , for the latter is given by @xmath157 . in the occupation basis @xmath158 , the hamiltonian reads    h=    0&0 + 0&-    .",

    "the ground state is given by @xmath159 and @xmath160 for @xmath161 and @xmath162 , respectively , with opposite parity .",
    "the minimal extension to this model that includes superconducting pairing includes two sites with spinless fermions . in this case",

    ", we can induce a parity change of the ground state ( protected crossing ) by changing the chemical potential at    ^2=t^2-^2 .    for smaller @xmath165",

    "this is in line with the behavior of bound states of two impurities in @xmath2-wave superconductors : they exhibit a protected crossing in the bound state spectrum .",
    "the presence of this protected crossing implies the existence of sub - gap shiba states in the energy spectrum : since a protected crossing has to occur upon varying @xmath90 , which could be considered as modeling the scalar impurity strength , it must be that sub - gap @xmath166 states exist - these are the shiba states .      a single site with a spinful fermion degree of freedom we exhibit singlet superconducting pairing @xmath167 .",

    ", the ground state has even parity , for larger @xmath170 , it has odd parity .",
    "this is congruent with the behavior of a ferromagnetic shiba chain on an @xmath1-wave superconductor .",
    "this model also shows that a density impurity can not induce a subgap bound state deep in an @xmath1-wave superconducting gap , for @xmath90 does not induce any phase transition in this model for @xmath171 .",
