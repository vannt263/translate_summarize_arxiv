    "quasielastic electron scattering from nuclei has long been used to study various aspects of nuclear structure .",
    "the strong quenching of the measured coulomb response relative to fermi gas estimates is one prominent example@xcite .",
    "such studies are facilitated by ( 1 ) the ( reasonably ) well - understood nature of the fundamental @xmath5 interaction and ( 2 ) by the relative weakness of that interaction .",
    "however , this same interaction suffers from some important shortcomings in that it probes the nucleus in a very restricted fashion .",
    "hence only two independent observables exist ( without making polarization measurements ) , namely the coulomb ( or longitudinal ) and transverse responses .",
    "these limitations have motivated a number of quasielastic scattering experiments employing hadronic probes@xcite .",
    "the more complicated interaction of the probe with nucleons means that  in principle ",
    "new responses which are inaccessible with electrons can be studied .",
    "one important example of such investigations is found in the @xmath6 ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath7 ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) experiments performed ( in part ) to extract the _ longitudinal _ spin response to complement information on the transverse spin response determined by electron scattering .",
    "analysis of such hadronic measurements is , however , hampered by the strength and complexity of the projectile- nucleon interaction .",
    "the former causes strong distortions in the incoming and outgoing projectile wavefunctions and localizes the scattering process in the region of the nuclear surface .",
    "the latter typically implies significant modification of the interaction in the nuclear medium .",
    "both sets of effects greatly complicate the theoretical description of the scattering process and the extraction of nuclear structure information .",
    "these considerations have led to much interest in @xmath0-nucleus scattering .",
    "the relative weakness of the @xmath8 interaction relative to , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath9 and @xmath10 interactions suggests that distortions and medium effects may be simpler to handle and that the scattering process may be more sensitive to the nuclear interior .",
    "estimates of the mean - free - paths ( mfp s ) of the various probes support the latter assertion .",
    "for example , at a laboratory momentum of 700 mev / c , the proton and the @xmath11 have mfp s of about 2 fm while the @xmath0 mfp is roughly twice that value .",
    "while @xmath0-nucleus scattering experiments are still in their infancy , their promise has been some what diminished by early results . in particular , there is a persistant discrepancy between measured @xmath0-nucleus elastic and total cross sections and theoretical results based on multiple scattering models which are expected to be accurate due again to the weakness of the @xmath8 interaction@xcite .    data for @xmath0-nucleus quasielastic scattering from c , ca and pb at a laboratory @xmath0 momentum of 705 mev / c have recently become available@xcite .",
    "a preliminary theoretical analysis of the @xmath12= 300 and 500 mev / c data for @xmath13c and @xmath3ca has already appeared along with the data@xcite . in the present paper , we extend those preliminary calculations and focus on comparison with @xmath14 data at @xmath4 mev / c . in so doing , we make the first attempt to realize the promise of @xmath0 scattering to provide nuclear structure information complementary to that extracted from electron data . the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we derive well known results for @xmath2 quasielastic scattering so as to establish a framework for treating @xmath0 scattering which is addressed in section iii .",
    "section iv touches upon problems associated with ambiguities in the forms of both the @xmath5 and @xmath8 on - shell elastic scattering amplitudes .",
    "past efforts to resolve the @xmath5 ambiguity are summarized and a resolution for @xmath8 is proposed .",
    "the theoretical treatment of nuclear structure is outlined in section v. specific calculations of electron and @xmath0 cross sections and comparisons with data appear in section vi where it is shown that , due to details of the structure of the @xmath0 quasielastic cross section , the strong quenching observed for the @xmath2 coulomb response does _ not _ appear for the @xmath0 process even though the latter is dominated by a contribution which is superficially very similar to the coulomb response .",
    "section vii contains a summary of the present work and our conclusions .",
    "the discussion of electron scattering from nucleons and nuclei presented in this section is considerably more detailed than would seem warranted given that no new results appear .",
    "however , this detail is supplied so as to provide a familiar context for developing our treatment of @xmath0 scattering which will be outlined in section iii .    the unpolarized @xmath1 scattering differential cross section in plane wave born approximation is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the initial and final electron 4-momenta , respectively , and the electron electromagnetic tensor is @xmath19 \\nonumber\\\\       & = & { 1\\over{\\epsilon_f\\epsilon_i}}\\       \\bigl[p_\\mu p_\\nu + { 1\\over 4 }      ( q^2 g_{\\mu\\nu}-q_\\mu q_\\nu)\\bigr ] \\label{bb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and , _ e.g. _ , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the electron mass . also , @xmath23 is the electromagnetic response of the scatterer . for nuclear scattering , @xmath24 where the polarization insertion @xmath25 is defined via @xmath26|i > \\nonumber\\\\      & = & \\int{{d\\omega}\\over{2\\pi}}\\ e^{-i\\omega(y_0-{y_0}')}\\       \\pi^{\\mu\\nu}_{em}(\\bfy,\\bfy';\\omega ) .",

    "the underestimation of transverse strength on the high - energy side of the peak , believed to be dominated by isobar formation and meson - exchange currents , is a common shortcoming of most `` one - nucleon '' models such as ours .",

    "for this reason , the mass @xmath28 fermi - gas calculations must be considered inadequate regardless of normalization .",

    "first , nm and fn calculations are much more alike for @xmath0 than for @xmath2 .",
    "second and more striking is the fact that rpa effects are relatively small for the @xmath0 cross sections in contrast to the large quenching they generate for the @xmath2 longitudinal response .",
    "this difference is even more surprizing since the @xmath0 cross section is _ dominated _ by `` longitudinal '' contributions ( _ i.e. _ , by terms in eq .",
    "[ ce ] not involving @xmath125 ) which are closely related to the @xmath2 longitudinal response .",
    "we will show that this difference arises from a subtle interplay of kinematic and relativistic nuclear structure effects .",

    "[ ce ] , our plane - wave expression for the latter . with this formula as our starting point , we can define @xmath249      \\label{ffa}\\ ] ] where @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 the `` @xmath254 '' subscript indicates we have dropped all transverse ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath255 ) contributions , retaining only `` longitudinal '' terms .",
    "we furthermore consider only isoscalar ( @xmath256 ) contributions since it is here that strong rpa correlations appear .",
    "these restrictions are intended to simplify the analysis by focussing exclusively on the physics of greatest interest .",
    "we recall that the isoscalar coulomb response is roughly half of the full response . to assess the relative importance of the longitudinal isoscalar contribution to the @xmath0 cross sections",
    ", we observe that , for @xmath8 scattering from a free nucleon , the longitudinal @xmath256 and @xmath257 contributions are @xmath258 and @xmath259 mb / sr , respectively , while the corresponding transverse contributions are @xmath260 and @xmath261 mb / sr .",
    "this shows that the longitudinal isoscalar contribution accounts for about two thirds of the total .",
    "thus the isoscalar longitudinal contributions to which we temporarily restrict our attention for the sake of simplicity are very significant components of the measured @xmath1 and @xmath0 quantities .",
    "let us now consider the specific case of @xmath0 scattering from a free nucleon of mass @xmath28 originally at rest . then eq .",

    "we still have @xmath264 and can write @xmath271    next we let @xmath272 and write @xmath273 and @xmath274 then , because @xmath275 is an excellent approximation , we have @xmath276 where @xmath277 is now equal to the integrated uncorrelated nuclear matter cross section per nucleon obtained from the cross sections designated in figures [ figc ] and [ figd ] by nm ( har ) .",

    "these behaviors are summarized in figure [ fige ] where we plot @xmath286 , @xmath292 and @xmath295 as they evolve from case ( _ i _ ) through case ( _ iii _ ) .",
    "we see that @xmath293 causes only a very small change in @xmath193 .",
    "hence , the ratio of the corresponding coulomb sums , @xmath296 , is nearly unity which implies that changing @xmath297 from @xmath28 , by itself , has very little consequence for electron scattering .",
    "the effect on the integrated @xmath0 quasielastic cross section is appreciable , however ; we find @xmath298 .",
    "this large effect is traceable to the delicate cancellation between the first two and the third terms of eq .",
    "[ ce ] and the changes in the kinematic factors multiplying these terms brought about by @xmath293 .",
    "overall , taking into account the effect of @xmath284 , the @xmath0 cross section is reduced by @xmath299 simply by letting @xmath300 .",
    "we next examine the effect of @xmath294 . the @xmath193 factor does not change as the coulomb strength is merely redistributed .",
    "however , now @xmath301 due to the lorentz contraction of the scalar density and in consequence the delicate cancellation alluded to above is somewhat altered .",
    "we find @xmath302 and the uncorrelated @xmath0 cross section goes up slightly so that @xmath303 .",
    "we finally consider the influence of the rpa correlations .",
    "as shown in figure [ fige ] , they cause @xmath193 to drop dramatically to @xmath304 ! this just reflects the strong rpa quenching of the coulomb response which , as mentioned above , is a well - known feature of the rha rpa@xcite .",
    "we further observe that @xmath305 goes from @xmath306 without correlations to @xmath307 with them which means that the summed responses @xmath308 and @xmath309 are quenched even more strongly by the rpa than is @xmath310 !",
    "indeed , @xmath309 is reduced by a factor of @xmath311 .",
    "this would seem to imply a _",
    "strong _ quenching of the @xmath0 cross section .",
    "however , as is evident in figure [ fige ] , such is not the case because @xmath312 , an increase which offsets the rpa quenching to the degree that @xmath313 drops only from @xmath314 to @xmath315 ( _ i.e. _ , by a factor of 0.91 ) when rpa effects are included . the large increase in @xmath287 in this case is due to the large reduction in @xmath305 , that is , due to _ differential _ quenching of time - like vector and scalar contributions in the rpa .",
    "if no such differential quenching were present , @xmath313 would necessarily decrease like @xmath193;_i.e .",
    "_ , like the coulomb sum . as the distinction between scalar and vector contributions is purely relativistic , it is hard to see how non - relativistic models of nuclear structure could simultaneously account for the strong quenching of the coulomb sum and the absence of quenching in the @xmath0 quasielastic scattering cross section in a manner as natural as for the present relativistic model .",
    "the preceeding analysis is based on a number of simplifying assumptions which can be tested , _",
    "e.g. _ , by comparing with the results of more complete nuclear matter calculations which  as we have already established  are quite consistent with the full finite nucleus results .",
    "figure [ fige ] compares the ratio of the integrated nuclear matter cross sections  labelled `` nm ''  with the @xmath316 ratio discussed above .",
    "the agreement is good enough to inspire confidence in the simplified analysis .",
    "overall , we find that the _ full _ integrated rha - rpa @xmath0 quasielastic cross section per ( effective ) nucleon which includes isoscalar transverse as well as isovector contributions _ is _ reduced from the ( isospin averaged ) @xmath8 cross section . for the vs representation of the @xmath8 amplitude ,",
    "the reduction factor is 0.94 while for the mixed representation the factor is 0.82 .",
    "these differences are clearly due to the different behavior of the isovector contributions , namely that they are appreciably enhanced by @xmath268 in the vs representation but little changed in the vt representation . by comparison ,",
    "the full integrated rha - rpa coulomb response per nucleon is reduced from the isospin averaged single nucleon value by a factor of 0.76 .",
    "clearly , while the @xmath0 reductions are less than for the coulomb , they are not dramatically different , especially when the mixed representation is used for the former .",
    "however , it is important to observe that the reduction of the @xmath0 cross section is not due just to the quenching of the underlying responses but depends also on the interference effects discussed above .",
    "most importantly , if it were not for the _ differential quenching _ of scalar versus time - like vector contributions which emerges naturally in our relativistic model of nuclear structure , the reduction factor for the @xmath0 cross section would be _ much _ smaller and therefore inconsistent with the @xmath0 quasielastic data .",
    "as it is , we have a gratifyingly accurate and consistent description of both the @xmath0 and @xmath2 data .",
    "we have formulated a treatment of @xmath0-nucleus quasielastic scattering in a manner which parallels as closely as possible more - or - less standard treatments of @xmath1-nucleus quasielastic scattering .",
    "the latter depends in a straightforward way on the coulomb ( or longitudinal ) and transverse nuclear responses which in turn are of great importance in understanding essentials of nuclear structure .",
    "we have shown that  in the present formulation  @xmath0 quasielastic scattering depends on these same dirac vector and tensor nuclear responses as well as additional ones containing dirac _",
    "scalar _ contributions .",
    "thus , in principle , @xmath0 quasielastic data can supplement and extend structure information extracted from the electron data and perhaps shed light on important issues such as the strong quenching of the coulomb sum@xcite .",

    "[ ce ] , and @xmath8 phase shift solutions@xcite .",
    "we have also briefly summarized problems associated with on - shell ambiguities in the form of the @xmath317 amplitude @xcite and have indicated how these problems carry over to the form of the @xmath8 amplitude .",
    "we rely on a meson - exchange model of the @xmath8 interaction@xcite to justify a specific form of this interaction expressed as a `` mixture '' of dirac vector and scalar invariants for the isoscalar channel and vector and tensor invariants for the isovector channel .",

    "we specifically focus on the relativistic hartree approximation@xcite and the rpa based on it@xcite .",
    "this treatment takes into account the polarization of the nucleon sea in one - loop approximation and in so doing provides a unique mechanism for quenching the coulomb response which is found to be in reasonable accord with experiment .",
    "we have given a thorough discussion of both full finite nucleus and nuclear matter calculations of the nuclear responses in the rha - rpa .",
    "we also have indicated how to fix the _ effective _ nuclear densities and @xmath291 values for the nuclear matter treatment of @xmath0 quasielastic scattering which is complicated by the absorption of the @xmath0 scattering waves .",
    "we have compared our calculations with the coulomb and transverse responses for @xmath3ca at @xmath4 mev / c@xcite .",
    "we reproduce the low-@xmath144 side of the transverse response quite well , but , as is typical of `` one - nucleon '' models such as ours , we underestimate the response on the high-@xmath144 side , presumably due to the omission of meson - exchange - current and @xmath318-isobar effects .",
    "rpa effects strongly quench the coulomb response relative to the uncorrelated results and bring about reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "this quenching can be interpreted as a screening of the nucleon charge due to polarization of the nucleon sea .",
    "finite nucleus effects appear to be important in reproducing the details of the shape of the measured coulomb response .",
    "we have also shown similar calculations for the new @xmath319 data at the same momentum transfer @xcite . here",
    "the quenching due to the rpa is much less than for the coulomb response and differences between finite nucleus and nuclear matter calculations are smaller .",
    "agreement of the full rha - rpa calculations with the measured cross sections is very good although the calculations slightly underestimate the data when the `` mixed '' representation of the @xmath8 amplitude is employed .",
    "we have gone on to explain why the rpa quenching of the @xmath0 cross section is so much less than what is observed for the coulomb response , a phenomenon which is all the more surprizing given the dominanance of the `` longitudinal isoscalar '' contribution in the former which is where rpa effects occur in our model .",
    "the situation becomes even more puzzling upon observing that the _ new _ responses containing scalar contributions which arise in the case of @xmath0 scattering ( see eq .",
    "[ ce ] ) are even more strongly quenched than the coulomb response .",
    "however , careful analysis shows that this _ differential quenching _ of responses alters a sensitive cancellation in the expression for the @xmath0 cross section in such a way that the cross section is only slightly reduced .",
    "the situation is qualitatively unchanged for the full @xmath0 quasielastic cross section which also includes transverse isoscalar and isovector components .",
