    "one of the oldest open problems in theoretical physics is that of describing fully developed turbulence on the basis of a microscopic model . the latter is usually taken to be the stochastic navier - stokes equation subject to an external random force which mimics the injection of energy by the large - scale modes ,",
    "see , e.g. ref .",
    "the aim of the microscopic theory is to verify the basic principles of the celebrated kolmogorov - obukhov phenomenological theory @xcite , study deviations from this theory and find the dependence of various green functions ( velocity correlation and response functions ) on the times , distances , external ( integral ) and internal ( viscous ) turbulence scales .",
    "most results are obtained within the framework of numerous semiphenomenological models which can not be considered to be the basis for construction of a regular expansion in a certain small ( at least formal ) parameter , see ref .",

    "one of the exceptions is provided by the renormalization group ( rg ) method earlier successfully applied in the theory of critical behavior to explain the origin of critical scaling and calculate universal quantities ( critical dimensions and scaling functions ) in the form of @xmath0 expansions , see ref.@xcite .",

    "viscous fluid it allows one to prove the existence of the infrared ( ir ) scale invariance with exactly known `` kolmogorov '' scaling dimensions and the independence of the correlation functions of the viscous scale ( the second kolmogorov hypothesis ) , and calculate a number of principal constants in a reasonable agreement with the experiment .",
    "the detailed exposition of the rg theory of turbulence and the bibliography can be found in the review paper @xcite .    as the model of isotropic",
    "incompressible fluid provides only a simplified description of real turbulent flows , it is interesting to generalize the model by taking into account anisotropy , compressibility , inhomogeneity , real geometry , and so on . in particular , in a number of papers the turbulence with the weak @xcite and strong @xcite uniaxial anisotropy has been studied .",
    "it was shown that , in the three - dimensional space , the ir scaling regime characteristic of the isotropic case survived also if the anisotropy was included ( in the language of the rg , this means that the corresponding fixed point remains ir stable ) .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the isotropic turbulence of compressible fluid was considered .",
    "the main difficulty is that the corresponding field theoretic model is not multiplicatively renormalizable , so that the rg technique is not directly applicable to it ( for this reason , the results obtained in ref .",

    "the problem was reduced to the calculation of scaling dimensions of certain nonlocal composite fields ( composite operators in the language of field theory ) , constructed from the fields of the renormalizable model of incompressible fluid .",
    "calculation of the scaling dimensions of composite operators is quite a cumbersome task . as a rule ,",
    "their renormalization involves their mixing with each other , and in order to find the scaling dimension of a given operator , one has to consider the entire family of operators that admix to it in the renormalization procedure .",

    "this is in agreement with the result obtained previously in @xcite within the approach based on the self - consistent equations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this proof was generalized to all orders of the formal expansion in @xmath5 .    it should be stressed that the stability of the kolmogorov fixed point in the presence of anisotropy is obviously not _ a priori _ : the analysis of the @xmath6-dimensional case shows that the stability is violated for @xmath7 @xcite ( the two - dimensional case requires special care , see ref .",
    "the stability of the kolmogorov regime is also destroyed for the anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence @xcite and for the strongly compressible fluid @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of compressibility in the first nontrivial order of the expansion in the small @xmath4 within the framework of a more realistic model of the uniaxial anisotropic turbulence .",
    "the anisotropy is not supposed to be small .",
    "like in the isotropic case @xcite , the problem is reduced to the calculation of the scaling dimensions of a class of nonlocal composite operators in the model of incompressible strongly anisotropic turbulence considered in @xcite .",
    "however , the set of relevant operators in this case is much wider than in ref.@xcite . using the technique developed in @xcite and the results obtained in @xcite , we have found all the scaling dimensions exactly .",
