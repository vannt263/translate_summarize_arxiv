    "the amount of data collected by infrared ( ir ) satellites and observatories has been continuously increasing over the past three decades .",
    "the evolution of the detectors allowed us to explore the interstellar medium ( ism ) and embedded objects in more and more detail .",
    "iras @xcite provided @xmath1 objects with flux above 0.5 jy at 12 @xmath2 .",
    "recently , based on observations of the wise @xcite infrared satellite , more than 700 million sources with @xmath3 accuracy above 1 mjy were catalogued in the allwise data release @xcite .",
    "infrared luminous objects cover a broad spectrum of object types .",
    "extragalactic sources , especially galaxies with ongoing star formation or agns , show similar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to that of the young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "evolved stars eject dust into their outer envelopes , which has infrared colours analogous to the dust surrounding ysos in their early evolutionary stages . in this work",
    "we identify the allwise sources by searching for a close counterpart in the simbad database , using a 5@xmath4 radius . the closest simbad source within this radius",
    "is associated with the allwise object .",
    "figure [ w1w2w2w3 ] illustrates the surface density of the known extragalactic sources , main sequence stars , evolved stars and ysos in the wise w1@xmath5w2 , w2@xmath5w3 colour  colour plane and it shows that the different object types have highly overlapping wise colours .",
    "linear methods would fail to separate the different object types and result in samples with high percentage of contamination , so the separation requires special attention .",
    "the complexity of the observable properties makes the object classification a fundamental and challenging problem .",
    "however , the commonly used schemes do not take advantage of all the available information .",
    "sources are often identified on colour  colour and colour  magnitude diagrams : @xcite characterized the spitzer @xcite irac @xcite colour and magnitude properties of proto and pre  main sequence stars in ngc 1333 , and completed the dataset with mips @xcite and j , h and k@xmath6 2mass @xcite data .",
    "this method was then extended by @xcite to several star forming clouds , located within 1 kpc of the sun .",
    "@xcite also used irac and mips colours together with 2mass data to identify ysos in the taurus molecular cloud ( tmc ) .",
    "they note that the method does not seem to successfully weed out all the galaxies .",
    "@xcite set criteria for yso identification on large scale maps of star forming regions , with a primary goal of mitigation of extragalactic contamination .",
    "this kind of large scale classification is problematic because of the wide variation of extinction . @xcite",
    "also identified yso candidates in the tmc by using wise photometry , as described in @xcite . by using far - ir ( four bands between 65 and 160 @xmath7 m ) akari @xcite fis @xcite colours and flux densities",
    ", @xcite successfully separated the sources of the akari bright source catalogue ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bsc ) in low - extinction regions by classifying them as either extragalactic sources or milky way stars . based on a combination of far  ir akari and mid  ir wise data , @xcite used quadratic discriminant analysis to identify yso candidates .",
    "their comparison to the known ysos of the simbad database showed that 90% of the training sample ysos were successfully reclassified as yso candidates , while the fraction of known contaminants remained @xmath810% .",
    "in this paper we built a multi  dimensional dataset containing near ",
    "ir 2mass and mid  ir wise data and we apply the support vector machine ( svm ) method to identify potential yso candidates .",
    "our goal is to create a catalogue of carefully selected yso candidates that can be used for statistical studies , and that can also provide a list of potential targets for future follow - up observations . we show that svm @xcite , which is a commonly used tool in pattern recognition and in multi  dimensional classification , is able to identify higher fraction of the training sample ysos than the regularly used polygonal selections on colour  colour and colour  magnitude planes .",
    "we have to note that , due to the lack of spectroscopic data , our training samples are based on simbad identifications . therefore , most of our comparisons are also estimates based on simbad .",
    "we identify extragalactic contaminants , galactic field stars , galactic evolved stars and other galactic contamination . as a result , yso candidates are identified and an attempt is made to separate them based on their evolutionary stages .",
    "verification of our method and comparison to existing methods of yso selection has been done .",
    "we also investigate , in a well - known star forming region ( i.e. the taurus  auriga  perseus ",

    "the surface density of different types was calculated in bins of 0.1 mag.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "to search for the yso candidates we used the allwise data release @xcite , which is an improved version of the wise all - sky data release @xcite .",
    "the allwise catalog contains information on 747,634,026 sources .",
    "we used not only brightness values in all 4 wise passbands ( 3.6 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath2 ) , but also the extended source flag ( _ ext _ ) , which indicates whether or not the morphology of a source is consistent with the wise point spread function , and also if the source is associated with or superimposed on a previously known extended object from the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc ) .",
    "we also used 2mass j , h , k@xmath6 magnitudes , which are provided in the allwise catalog , based on 2mass psc @xcite associations . instead of the whole allwise catalogue",
    ", we used only those sources that matched the following criteria : ( 1 ) snr@xmath93 in all four wise bands and ( 2 ) 2mass j , h , k@xmath6 magnitudes are available with photometric errors lower than 0.1 mag . applying",
    "these criteria resulted in 8,956,636 sources .",
    "these form our initial sample , which hereafter we call the _",
    "w0 _ sample .    at the position of each source we estimated the dust optical depth ( @xmath10 ) by using the 353ghz r1.2 planck dust opacity maps @xcite .",
    "this operation allowed us to include the effect of interstellar reddening in our analysis .      for classification and pattern recognition in multi ",
    "dimensional data , one can use several statistical methods .",
    "we used the support vector machine ( svm ) , a class of supervised learning algorithm , developed by vladimir vapnik @xcite as an extension to non - linear models of the generalized portrait algorithm .",
    "svm calculates decision planes between different known classes of objects and applies the decision planes to objects of unknown classes .",
    "these unknown objects are classified based on their position in the multi  dimensional parameter space with respect to the separation boundaries .",
    "a more detailed description of the method can be found in @xcite .",
    "various statistical methods are usually among the major ingredients of professional statistical software packages .",
    "we used the @xmath11 implementation of svm in our work .",
    "svm is a supervised learning algorithm , therefore it needs a training set , which is used to determine the boundaries in the parameter space between the different object types . to find out the object types of our sources , we searched the simbad database for counterparts within @xmath12 radius .",
    "if more than one object was located within this radius , then the type of the closest entry was used .",
    "more information about the simbad object identification can be found in @xcite . following this strategy",
    ", we were able to identify 890,552 sources of the _ w0 _ sample .",
    "we are aware that individual source identifications in simbad might not be fully reliable . however , for our purposes , we only need training samples that are statistically reliable .",
    "the number of sources found per object type are listed in the _ w0 _ column of table [ simbadcomparison ] . unless noted otherwise , in the remaining of this paper the expression `` known object '' always refers to a simbad identification .",
    "the average colours and magnitudes for each simbad object type in our _ w0 _ sample are listed in tables [ simbadcolours1][simbadcolours9 ] .    because the number of known sources from the different object types was very inhomogeneous ,",
    "e.g. much more known extragalactic objects and field stars were found than ysos , we checked if the classification is affected by the number of sources used in the training samples . to this end , we considered two cases : a ) we used all objects of given object types , b ) we used a maximum number of 1000 sources of each object types .",
    "we found that the number of false - positives and false - negatives differs by less than 1% between case a ) and b ) .",
    "therefore in our classification scheme the number of objects used in the training sample was always limited to 1,000 , allowing us to speed up our classification process .",
    "a multi - step classification scheme was developed to remove the contaminating sources from our sample , and to identify the yso candidates with high accuracy .",
    "the steps of our classification are shown in figure [ dectree ] .",
    "each step and the corresponding training samples are described in detail below . although svm is a very powerful tool , the necessity of a multi - step classification scheme can be explained by considering the complex structure of the ism .",
    "the interstellar reddening has an impact on the apparent colours of the sources , therefore it is important to take into account where different object types are typically found as a function of ism column density .",
    "for this purpose , and by using the planck dust opacity maps , we binned our sources according to the dust opacity value registered at their position in the sky .",
    "@xcite performed a careful examination of the allwise catalogue : they inspected , at the positions of the allwise sources , the higher resolution spitzer images . in addition , in selected regions of the sky , they compared spitzer source catalogues to allwise lists of sources .",
    "their analysis led them to conclude that several allwise catalogued sources are spurious , and that many are likely ism knots , or _",
    "cirrus_. following their finding , our very first step was to identify and remove the spurious sources from our _ w0 _ sample .    to train the svm we checked the wise w3 and w4 images of _ w0 _ positions in five different regions : the galactic centre , the california molecular cloud , the galactic anti - centre , the @xmath13 oph star forming region and the cepheus molecular complex . in these regions we selected 680 positions where we were able to clearly identify a point source , and 664 positions where visual source identification was not possible .",
    "examples for these real and spurious allwise detections are shown in figure [ realw3w4 ] and figure [ fakew3w4 ] , respectively .",
    "the training samples included , for these sources , the allwise catalogue information on the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , the reduced @xmath14 value , the number of times the source was detected with snr@xmath93 and the number of profile fits in the w3 and w4 bands .    with the help of the training sample described above ,",
    "we classified the _ w0 _",
    "sample into two classes : real and spurious sources .",
    "the misclassification rate , i.e. the rate of false positive and false negatives , was investigated as a function of the number of elements used in the training sample .",
    "figure [ spuriousmisclass ] shows that the rate of misclassified sources does not change significantly with the number of elements used .",
    "the ratio of false negatives was 7.2@xmath151.4% in the test .",
    "the lowest misclassification rate was achieved with the maximum number of elements in the training sample ( 5.7% ) .",
    "the fraction of false positives was found to be 1.8@xmath150.6% . with the maxmimum number of elements in the training sample , it was 1.7% .",
    "the spurious and real sources were classified in their own class with 98.3% and 94.3% success rate , respectively . applying the determined classification boundaries to our initial sample",
    ", we classified 5,366,238 sources as spurious and 3,590,398 sources as real .",
    "the latter constitutes what we refer to as _ real _ sample .",
    "the simbad database lists 235 object types .",
    "this large variety makes the training of the algorithm rather inefficient . to make the algorithm more powerful and to have statistically more robust training samples , we binned the object types based on similarities in their j@xmath5h , h@xmath5k@xmath6 , k@xmath16w1 , w1@xmath5w2 , w2@xmath5w3 , w3@xmath5w4 colours and on the _ ext _ ( extended source ) parameter .",
    "figures [ exgal_ext][ism_ext ] show the distribution of the average colours and the average _ ext _ values .",
    "three large groups of simbad extragalactic objects were created .",
    "simbad types belonging to the g1 group have low h@xmath5k@xmath6 and w1@xmath5w2 colours and have mostly high _ ext _ values .",
    "source types of g2 group are less extended based on the _ ext _ value and have high w1@xmath5w2 values .",
    "the remaining sources were classified as g3 , and are mostly extended like the g1 objects but have higher colour indices at shorter wavelengths .    evolved stars were also grouped in three large bins .",
    "e1 type objects have rather small colour indices and are more compact , while e2 types have high j@xmath5k colours compared to the other object types .",
    "e3 objects have w2@xmath5w3 colour higher than all the other evolved types .",
    "two bins of young simbad objects were created : all colour indices of y1 sources are higher than those of y2 objects .",
    "y1 sources also appear to be less compact because they have higher _ ext _ values .",
    "the simbad type `` * '' ( single star ) was not further binned .",
    "finally , two groups of simbad source types of ism related objects were defined .",
    "ism1 sources appear to be more compact than ism2 .",
    "the 11 subtypes are listed below , including all simbad types associated to each of them :    * g1 : galaxy , part of a galaxy , galaxy in cluster of galaxies , brightest galaxy in a cluster , galaxy in group of galaxies , galaxy in pair of galaxies , radio galaxy , hii galaxy , low surface brightness galaxy , emission - line galaxy , starburst galaxy , blue compact galaxy , liner - type active galaxy nucleus * g2 : active galaxy nucleus , seyfert 2 galaxy , blazar , seyfert galaxy * g3 : broad absorption line system , gravitationally lensed image , gravitationally lensed image of a quasar , seyfert 1 galaxy , quasar , absorption line system , damped ly - alpha absorption line system , possible quasar , bl lac - type object * y1 : young stellar object , variable star of fu ori type , young stellar object candidate * y2 : variable star of orion type , t tau - type star , t tau star candidate * e1 : horizontal branch star , s star , red giant branch star , possible carbon star , possible s star , carbon star , yellow supergiant star , asymptotic giant branch star , evolved supergiant star , variable star of mira cet type , possible yellow supergiant star , possible horizontal branch star , possible red supergiant star , red supergiant star * e2 : possible supergiant star , possible asymptotic giant branch star , oh / ir star * e3 : post - agb star , post - agb star candidate * s : single star * ism1 : interstellar matter , hi shell , high - velocity cloud , emission object , planetary nebula , possible planetary nebula , supernova remnant , supernova remnant candidate , dark cloud ( nebula ) , cloud , part of cloud , outflow * ism2 : molecular cloud , hii ( ionized ) region , galactic nebula , globule ( low - mass dark cloud )      first , the _ real _ sample was analysed with the goal of removing the extragalactic sources .",
    "we were able to identify 105,564 known extragalactic sources , including all simbad object types that belong to the galaxy type . as seen in figure [ simbadgal ]",
    "their surface density distribution in the sky is very inhomogenous .",
    "regions close to the galactic mid - plane and around known giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , like orion ( at l@xmath17200 , b@xmath1810 ) or cepheus",
    "( at l@xmath17110 , b@xmath1710 ) are almost free of extragalactic sources .",
    "these regions contain high amount of ism compared to the surroundings , therefore the extragalactic source distribution is biased in these regions .",
    "on one hand , the ism is opaque at visual and near - ir wavelengths .",
    "most of the simbad extragalactic counts were made in the visual and near - ir regime , resulting in incomplete catalogues .",
    "on the other hand , ir - bright ism features are able to cover fainter extragalaxies , making them undetectable .",
    "third , the interstellar reddening modifies the apparent colours of the background objects .",
    "we found that 90% of the extragalactic sources are located in regions where @xmath19 and only 1% are located in regions where @xmath20 ( see figure [ galebv ] ) .",
    "nine percent are located in regions between the two values . after investigating which colours and brightness values provide the highest separation between the extragalactic sources and all the other object types",
    ", we found that our trainer would provide the best separation if the j@xmath5h , j@xmath5w4 , k@xmath16w4 , w2@xmath5w3 colours , the j and w2 band magnitudes and the _ ext _ parameter are used . in each of these three regions ( with characteristic @xmath10 values )",
    ", we performed an svm classifications using all subtypes listed in the previous section .",

    "bins , and are represented on linear scale from @xmath21 to @xmath22.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as a result 377,126 sources have been classified as extragalactic sources ( g1 , g2 or g3 ) , and were removed to build the _ galaxy - free _ sample .",
    "out of the 105,564 already known extragalactic objects 105,376 were re - classified as extragalactic , and only 188 were misclassified ( false - negative ) .",
    "real _ sample contained 5,685 known ysos , of which only 117 were classified as extragalactic source ( false - positive ) .",
    "after removing the sources classified as extragalactic objects our goal was to remove the main - sequence ( ms ) stars from the remaining 3,213,272 sources .",
    "this _ galaxy - free _ sample contained 932,531 known ms stars .",
    "as it was done in case of the galaxy removal , we checked again the @xmath10 distribution of the ms stars and divided the sky into three regions .",
    "those regions contained one third of the known ms stars , having @xmath23 , @xmath24 and in - between .",
    "also ( as in the previous step ) , the average colours and brightness values of the different subtypes were calculated to achieve a maximum possible separation between ms stars and all the other object types .",
    "performing this task led us to use the colours h@xmath5w4 , k@xmath16w4 , w1@xmath5w2 , w2@xmath5w3 , w3@xmath5w4 , the h and w4 band magnitude values and the _ ext _ parameter .",
    "our results showed that we successfully removed 90.1% of the known ms stars of the _ galaxy - free _ sample , by classifying 2,052,410 sources as ms star . at the same time",
    "only 327 of the known ysos were classified as ms star , meaning that 92.5% of the known ysos of the _ real _ sample were still kept .      in the next step we wanted to divide the remaining ( _ galaxy- and ms star - free _ ) 1,160,862 sources into three main categories : evolved stars ( e1 , e2 and e3 subtypes ) , ism related objects ( ism1 and ism2 subtypes ) and yso candidates ( y1 and y2 subtypes ) , with the goal to keep sources classified as y1 or y2 . we were not able to identify regions , where one of the object types was dominant , thus cuts in the @xmath10 value were not applied .",
    "the training sample was prepared by using j@xmath5h , w2@xmath5w3 , w3@xmath5w4 colours , the w2 magnitude and the _ ext _ parameter .",
    "this classification step resulted in losing only 210 of the known ysos , while keeping 88.8% of the known ysos in the _ real _ sample .",
    "we also removed 11,589 of the known evolved stars . compared to the number of",
    "known evolved stars in the _ real _ sample , 27.4% of them were still present at this stage .",
    "we were also able to remove 62.3% of the known ism related objects . the resulting yso candidate sample ( sources classified as y1 or y2 ) contained 751,628 sources .",
    "the last step was to separate the class i , ii and iii sources @xcite with the ultimate goal of finding reliable class i and class ii yso candidates .",
    "class i and ii sources have a significant ir excess that originates from the dust in their circumstellar envelopes or protoplanetary disks .",
    "the class iii sources have infrared colours more similar to main sequence stars , but still showing infrared excess .",
    "the simbad database does not list information on the actual evolutionary stage of the known ysos , therefore our training sample was prepared based on yso catalogs from the literature , preferably listing the evolutionary classes .",
    "we used catalogs from the following papers : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we note that these papers and their classification methods are based on ir data , mainly obtained with the spitzer space telescope @xcite .",
    "we also used @xcite and @xcite , which are catalogues of spectroscopically confirmed ysos , and @xcite and @xcite listing ysos with x - ray data .    based on these catalogues",
    ", we created a training sample that contained 247 class i , 1925 class ii and 313 class iii objects ( the latter category includes sources of @xcite , being stars in star forming regions , but showing mostly photospheric colours ) . in order to simplify the classification , where listed , we considered transition disk and flat sed objects as class ii sources .    the first attempt to classify our yso candidates into evolutionary stages failed , and the contamination caused by asymptotic giant branch star candidates ( `` ab ? '' as listed in simbad ) was still high",
    "therefore , the following step was additionally performed : the svm was trained by using three subtypes , the class i / ii , the classiii+ and the `` ab ? '' stars .",
    "majority of the `` ab ? ''",
    "objects are those identified by @xcite , and we disagree with their statement `` ysos and agb stars can be mostly separated by simple colour  magnitude selection criteria '' .",
    "the j@xmath5h , h@xmath5w3 , w1@xmath5w2 , w1@xmath5w4 and w2@xmath5w3 colours were used along with the w2 magnitude and the _ ext _ parameter , to create our training sample .    as a final result we classified @xmath25 sources as class i / ii candidates .",
    "their surface density distribution is shown on figure [ ysocandidatessd ] .",
    "compared to the training sample of 247 class i , 1925 class ii and 313 class iii objects , the resulting class i / ii candidate sample contains 240 of the known class i , 1824 of the known class ii and 79 of the known class iii sources .",
    "this means that 95% of the known class i+ii sources were successfully kept , while 74.8% of the class iii sources were removed .",
    "likewise , in this last step 63.7% of the known agb star candidates were also removed .",
