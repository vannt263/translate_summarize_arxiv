    "simulations have been also utilized to study the statistics of tie subchains and tie molecules@xcite .",

    "due to the limitation of the computational resources , in most cases we need to employ coarse - grained models rather than atomistic models .",
    "these coarse - grained models involve some approximations and simplifications , not all of which are justified . to simplify the model , in some cases ( especially for off - lattice systems ) , the ideal gaussian chain statistics",
    "is assumed without justification .",

    "the ideal gaussian chain statistics is reproduced as a result of the screening effect@xcite , and naively , we expect that such a screening can be realized only in a bulk system .",
    "if the screening is not perfect , or if an external field is applied , the statistics of a polymer chain deviates from the ideal gaussian chain statistics . in such cases ,",

    "block copolymer melts , statistics of polymer chains are known to be qualitatively different from one of the bulk systems . for example , a diblock copolymer chain in a strongly segregated lamellar microphase separation structure is highly stretched , and the chain size ( which is comparable to the lamellar period ) scales as @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 being the polymerization index)@xcite .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the @xmath1-dependence of an ideal gaussian chain size in a bulk , @xmath2 .",

    "we can observe that the potential field is almost constant except the narrow regions near the crystal - amorphous interfaces .",
    "this result is similar to the milner s simulation results .",

    "the statistics of chains deviates from the ideal gaussian chain statistics without any potential fields .",
    "this means that the naive assumption of the ideal gaussian chain statistics may lead qualitatively incorrect results for some statistical quantities .",
    "for example , our simulation results show that the chain statistics strongly depends on the graft density @xmath20 .",
    "however , some tie chain models are based on the statistics which is independent of the graft density does not show such graft density dependence .",
    "the huang - brown type model@xcite assumes that the tie chain statistics is essentially determined by the gaussian chain statistics in the melt state . in such models , the effect of the graft density",
    "is not taken into account ( at least explicitly ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the effective potential fields obtained by our simulations ( and by milner s simulations ) are qualitatively much different from the potential fields in polymer brush systems@xcite . in the case of the melt brush ,",

    "this situation is similar to our system .",
    "however , the potential field in melt brush depends strongly on the distance from the wall .",

    "( due to this mechanism , the constraints by the graft and incompressibility may be very weak , except near the crystal - amorphous interfaces . ) on the other hand , in a melt brush , the number of segments in a grafted chain is constant .",
    "the statistics of the tie subchains deviates from one expected from the ideal gaussian chain statistics .",
    "this would be observed clearly if we compare our simulation results with the estimates based on the ideal gaussian chain statistics without any constraints . as shown in appendix [ statistics_of_tie_subchain_without_constraints ] , the tie subchain fraction decays exponentially as @xmath5 increases for large @xmath5 .",
    "this @xmath5-dependence is qualitatively different from the scf simulation result where the absorbing boundary condition and the incompressible condition are imposed .",
    "namely , we underestimates the tie subchain fraction if we assume the ideal gaussian chain statistics . besides , without constraints ,",
    "the average number of segments of a tie subchain depends @xmath5 as @xmath124 ( for large @xmath5 ) , which is again qualitatively different from the scf simulation result .",
    "thus , the statistics of ideal gaussian chains without any constraints can not explain the statistics of subchains between crystalline lamellae .",
    "the boundary condition and the interaction between segments are essential for the tie subchain statistics .    from the scf simulation results",
    ", we expect that the tie subchain fraction and the average number of segments of a tie subchain depend on the system size as @xmath125 interestingly , this system size dependence of @xmath106 is the same as one of an ideal gaussian chain .",
    "although a tie subchain does not behave as an ideal gaussian chain , some properties of the tie subchain may be reasonably modelled with the ideal gaussian chain statistics .",
    "it should be mentioned here that these results are consistent with the lattice - based gambler s ruin model@xcite .",
    "we consider that this is because the incompressible and impenetrable conditions are satisfied in the gambler s ruin model .",
    "although the gambler s ruin model does not utilize the effective mean field potential field , the incompressible condition can control the conformation of subchains and thus the resulting statistics becomes similar to the scf model .",
    "it would be worth mentioning that the scf model presented in this work is continuum and thus it is free from the limitations and artifacts of lattice - based models .",
    "for example , our model can continuously change the parameters such as @xmath5 and @xmath20 .    from the result in section [ effective_potential_field ] together with the simple system size relation ( eq ) , we expect that there may be a universality for the tie subchain statistics .",
    "if the tie chain distribution is universal , we may be able to construct a master curve for the tie chain distribution function . to examine",
    "whether such a master curve can be constructed or not , we rescale the number of segments @xmath67 and the tie chain distribution function @xmath126 by the average number of segments @xmath106 and the total tie chain fraction @xmath103 , respectively . figure [ master_curve_tie_distribution ] shows the rescaled tie chain distribution functions for various different values of @xmath5 and @xmath20 .",
    "we can observe that all the rescaled tie chain distributions collapse into one master curve within an acceptable error .",
    "thus we conclude that the tie chain distribution function is universal ( at least in the examined parameter range ) .",
    "moreover , the master curve can be reasonably fitted to the following empirical form : @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are fitting parameters .",
    "the fitting with the scf simulation data ( shown in figure [ master_curve_tie_distribution ] ) gives @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "here it would be fair to mention the limitaions of our scf model .",
    "although our model gives interesting results on the statistics of loop and tie subchains , it should be noticed that our model is based on some assumptions",
    ". we should be careful whether the assumptions are reasonable for the target systems or not .",
    "for example , if the molecular weight is small , the effect of free ends ( cilia ) is not negligible .",
    "the annealing may not fully equilibrate the subchains due to the very slow relaxation by trapped entanglements ( true entanglements ) .",
    "the trapped entanglements would largely affect the chain statistics .",
    "as an example , we consider two loop subchains which are connected to different interfaces . if two loop subchains are entangled , there are constraint on the conformations of subchains .",
    "( unentangled conformations are not allowed . )",
    "this constraint affects the path integral field and the partition function .",
    "intuitively , we expect that the long subchains are easily entangled , and thus the constraint by trapped entanglements becomes important especially for short subchains . unfortunately , as far as the authors know , it is quite difficult to take into account the trapped entanglements into the continuum field models such as the scf model .",
    "the extension of the scf model , or the combination of the scf and molecular models @xcite would be required to study the effect of trapped entanglements . despite these limitations",
    ", we believe that our model can still provide non - trivial results , and can be utilized to study statistics and properties of amorphous subchains .",
    "our simulation models can handle various parameters and is suitable to determine some statistical quantities of the tie subchains , as shown in section [ results ] . here",
    "we discuss how our model and results can be used for applications .",
    "a simple but interesting application is the combination of our simulation model with other coarse - grained simulation models .",
    "the combined simulations will enable us to perform large scale simulations with small computational costs .",
    "the modelling and simulations for larger systems ( which consist of multiple crystalline and amorphous layers ) are left for future works .",
    "the free energy per unit volume may be utilized to analyze the multiple crystalline and amorphous layers .",
    "as shown in figure [ free_energy_per_unit_volume](a ) , the free energy per unit volume decreases as the thickness of the amorphous layer increases .",
    "intuitively , this can be interpreted as a repulsive interaction between crystal - amorphous interfaces which stabilize the crystalline lamellar structure .",
    "the simulation results obtained in this work can also be used as inputs for theoretical models .",
    "for example , we can use the tie subchain distribution to estimate the whole chain conformation in multiple crystalline and amorphous layers .",
    "such calculation gives the tie molecule fraction in annealed and well - equilibrated systems .",
    "becasue the tie subchain statistics has rather simple properties ( such as eqs and ) , some statistical quantities may be simple .",
    "we expect that the resulting tie modelcule statistics will be applied to various systems ( as long as the chains are well - equilibrated ) , and the comparison of thus estimated tie molecule statistics with experimental data is an interesting future work .",
    "if we use the effective potential field as a mean - field potential for molecular simulations , some dynamical properties of amorphous subchains can be studied .",
    "although the potential layer is thin , it may modulate the dynamics of amorphous subchains .",
    "we naturally expects that the segments near the graft points will behave in a qualitatively different way from the segments apart from the graft points .",
    "such a picture is consistent with the three - phase models for crystalline polymers@xcite . in the three - phase models",
    ", there is an intermediate layer between crystalline and amorphous layers .",
    "our model will be useful to estimate the properties of the intermediate layers .",
    "another interesting application is the annealing dynamics .",
    "the dynamic scf model@xcite allows us to simulate the relaxational dynamics . by combining our model with the dynamic scf model , the simulations for the relaxation of subchain distributions will be possible .",
    "such simulations will give the time evolution of the tie subchain distribution .",
    "if we start the simulation from a nonequilibrium subchain distribution , the rearrangement of subchains will be observed .",
    "nmr experiments@xcite showed that the polymer chains diffuse between the crstal and amorphous regions during the annealing , and fraction of tight and semi - rigid amorphous chains changes by annealing processes .",
    "the comparison of the simulation data and the nmr data will be interesting .",
    "we proposed the scf model for the amorphous chain statistics between crystalline lamellae .",
    "we also proposed a numerical scheme for the scf model and preformed simulations with various different system sizes and graft densities . in our model",
    ", the amorphous - crystal interfaces are modelled as impenetrable surfaces , and a subchain is modelled as a graft chain .",
    "we explicitly took into account the incompressible condition , which originally arose from the interaction between segments .",
    "the scf simulation results showed that there exist thin potential layers near the crystal - amorphous interfaces .",
    "a potential layer consists of two sublayers .",

    "the tie subchains consist of larger number of segments than the average .",
    "the system size dependence of the average number of segments in the tie subchain and tie subchain fraction obey rather simple statistics , and they are consistent with the prediction of the gambler s ruin model .",
