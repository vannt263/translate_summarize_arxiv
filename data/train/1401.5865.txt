    "maybe the energy differences of the second and third excited state are strange at the degenerate point .",
    "those differences may be verified by the recent experiments with ultrastrong coupling .    in ultrastrong coupling regime ,",
    "the deviation from the jc model known as bloch - siegert shift was experimentally observed@xcite , which is an lc resonator magnetically coupled to a superconducting flux qubit in the ultrastrong coupling regime , and the system can be modeled by the hamiltonian , @xmath230 with @xmath231 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is conventionally set to 1 .",
    "following results shown in ref.@xcite , if we neglect the term @xmath235 , which only contributes a constant @xmath236 to the second order under the transformation @xmath237 . and by omitting the counter - rotating term , the corresponding jc model is given by @xmath238 in the ultrastrong coupling regime , the rotating wave approximation is thus inappropriate , the experimental results of this system will not agree with the jc model .",
    "the bloch - siegert shift caused by the counter - rotating term is evidently observed .",
    "then , we directly use our proposed anisotropic model to fit this system @xmath239 where the anisotropic parameter @xmath12 is decided by fitting , and @xmath74ghz , @xmath75ghz , @xmath76na , @xmath77ghz , are the same as previous obtained @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , we can find that the experimental data agree perfectly with the case @xmath78 ( red dashed dot line ) which is neither the rabi model nor the jc model , and we remark that the result of @xmath240 case seems similar as the hamiltonian ( [ mooij - hamil ] ) ( solid black line ) , and @xmath241 case is the same as the jc hamiltonian ( [ mooij - hamil - jc ] ) ( dashed black line ) .",
    "here we try to comment that by this experimental set up , the anisotropic rabi model may be tested in a full regime by using qubit devices with strength of coupling ranging from weak to ultrastrong up to @xmath242ghz within current technologies .",
