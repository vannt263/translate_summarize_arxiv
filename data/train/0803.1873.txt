    "the `` black magic '' calculus of quantum mechanics allows us to make predictions about expectation values of certain measurement outcomes ; however these expectation values are surprising in the following ways : on one hand we know from bell s inequality @xcite that not all possible quantum mechanical expectation values are compatible with a local hidden variable model ; on the other hand , not all expectation values which originate from a non - signaling constrained probability theory are quantum mechanical @xcite . given the quantum mechanical description of the measurement device ,",
    "the question arises which expectation values are compatible with quantum theory at all .",
    "the quantum mechanical moment problem @xcite , as well as its truncated version @xcite are famous paradigms of this sort of question .",
