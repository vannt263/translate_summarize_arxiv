    "in the last decade , many efforts were dedicated to characterizing qualitatively and quantitatively the entanglement properties of condensed matter systems which are the natural candidate to apply for quantum communication , as well as quantum information . in this sense",

    "this aforementioned is a rather new and remarkable result regarding the entanglement properties of vbs quantum spin ground states .",
    "a theory for localizable entanglement was developed based on matrix product states from the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method and applied to vbs states@xcite . in reference @xcite , an experimental implementation was proposed for vbss of the spin-1 heisenberg hamiltonians and ladders , and a method was proposed directly to measure quantum observables that are not accessible in standard materials in condensed matter .    motivated by real materials such as @xmath0 known as azurite , which is an interesting quantum antiferromagnetic model described by heisenberg model on generalized diamond chain .",

    "@xcite studied the dynamic and thermodynamic properties for this model .",
    "moreover , the thermodynamics of the ising - heisenberg model on diamond - like chain was also widely discussed in references@xcite . the motivation to research the ising - xyz diamond chain model",
    "is based in some recent works . according to the experiments of the natural mineral azurite , theoretical calculations of ising - xxz model , as well as the experimental result of the exchange dimer ( interstitial sites ) parameter and their descriptions of the various theoretical models .",
    "the 1/3 magnetization plateau , the double peaks both in the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat , was observed in the experimental measurements@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the dimer ( interstitial sites ) are exchange much more strong than those nodal sites .",
    "since dimmer interaction is much higher than the rest , it can be represented as an exactly solvable ising - heisenberg model . in addition ,",

    "the entanglement of the two - qubit isotropic heisenberg system decreases when the temperature increases which vanishes beyond a threshold temperature @xmath1 .",
    "however , two qubits with xyz coupling displays quite interesting thermal entanglement behavior@xcite , such as more than one threshold temperature . on the other hand , an unusual property of entanglement",
    "also was considered in an alternating ising and heisenberg spins in simple one - dimensional chain@xcite , where despite at zero temperature there is no any evidence of entanglement , then rise a small amount of concurrence indicating the system has a thermal entanglement between two heisenberg spins .",
