    "among various collective excitations in an atomic gas trapped in a harmonic potential , the dipole mode has the unique property that its frequency is always equal to the trap frequency , irrespective of the interaction between the atoms .",

    "these excited states are referred to collectively as the  kohn modes \" in the theoretical literature ( the `` sloshing modes '' in the recent cold atom experimental literature ) .    while kohn s theorem is exact , it is not a trivial problem as to whether or not it holds when the interaction is treated approximately .",
