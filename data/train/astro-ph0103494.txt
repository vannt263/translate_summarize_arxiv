    "abundance determinations of stars in galactic globular clusters can provide valuable information about important astrophysical processes such as stellar evolution , stellar structure , galactic chemical evolution and the formation of the milky way .",
    "surface stellar abundances of c , n , o , and often na , mg , and al are found to be variable among red giants within a globular cluster .",
    "the physical process responsible of these star - to - star element variations is still uncertain ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) .    of particular importance to the present study",
    "are the results of @xcite , who found that [ fe / h ]  among m92 subgiants is a factor of two smaller than [ fe / h ]  from red giants in the same cluster @xcite .",
    "if this result is not due to systematic differences arising from the analysis procedures of the different groups that handle the red giant branch ( rgb ) and the subgiant samples , then the results of @xcite would suggest some modification of photospheric fe abundances which would be quite difficult to explain . clearly the present day clusters stars are incapable of modifying their own fe abundances through nucleosynthesis . yet evolution - driven changes in [ fe / h ]  could be possible if the outer envelopes of the subgiants were somehow infused with fe - poor external material .",
    "thus as evolution progesses up the rgb the deeping convective envelope would dilute the photospheric [ fe / h]with more fe - rich `` unmodified '' material from the interior causing an increase in [ fe / h ]  with luminosity .",
    "we note the unlikelyhood of this scenario as fe , unlike the lighter elements , is not involved in normal mass transfer processes that might ocurr in binary systems or in normal stellar winds , and is only produced in supernovae .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to understand how cluster stars could be contaminated by material with _",
    "less _ fe , presumably at a time after the present subgiants had formed .    in order to study the origin of the star - to - star abundance variations and to address the issues raised by @xcite",
    ", we have started a program to determine chemical abundances of the nearer galactic globular cluster stars . in this paper , we present our results for the iron abundance of m71 , the nearest globular cluster reachable from the northern hemisphere .",
    "similar programs are underway at eso by @xcite and @xcite taking advantage of the fact that the nearest globular cluster accessible from a southern site ( ngc 6397 ) is 1.8 times close than m71 and has a lower reddening .",
    "our m71 sample includes stars over a large range in luminosity : 19 giant stars , 3 horizontal branch stars , and 3 stars near the main sequence turnoff , in order to study in a consistent manner red giants , horizontal branch stars , and stars at the main sequence turnoff .",
    "details on the star sample , observations , data reduction and determination of stellar parameters are described in paper i. previous high dispersion abundance analysis for m71 involve studies of red giants only , resulting in [ fe / h ]  of @xmath10.70 @xcite , @xmath10.80 @xcite , between @xmath10.6 and @xmath11.0 @xcite , and @xmath10.79 @xcite .",
    "we begin our analysis with fe , as many fe lines are identified in our hires spectra over a wide range of excitation potentials and line strengths , as well as over two ionization states ( fe i and fe ii ) .",
    "the iron abundance analysis is done using a current version of the lte spectral synthesis program moog @xcite .",
    "a line list specifying the wavelengths , excitation potentials , gf  values , damping constants , and equivalent widths for the observed fe i and fe ii lines is required .",
    "the provenance of the gf  values and the measurement of equivalent widths are discussed below .",
    "the damping constants for all fe i and fe ii lines were set to twice that of the unsld approximation for van der waals broadening following @xcite .",
    "the use of the blackwell approximation for the damping constants gives the same result within the errors , when comparing [ fe / h ]  obtained with the `` good line set '' of fe i ( see definition of line sets on sec .",
    "in addition , a model atmosphere for the effective temperature and surface gravity appropriate for each star and a value for the microturbulent velocity are also required .",
    "we use the grid of model atmospheres from @xcite with a metallicity of [ fe / h ]  = @xmath10.5 dex , based on earlier high dispersion abundance analysis of m71 red giants @xcite .",
    "the final result for [ fe / h ]  is not sensitive to small changes in the metallicity of the model atmosphere . in particular ,",
    "the error introduced by using a model with [ fe / h ]  = @xmath10.5 instead of @xmath10.7 dex is very small ( see tables 2 & 3 ) .",
    "the effective temperatures and surface gravities are derived from the photometry of the stars as described in paper i. the error in the photometric @xmath0  is 75 k for giants and 150 k for the dwarfs and the error in the photometric log(@xmath2 )  is 0.2 dex ( paper i ) .",
    "the microturbulent velocity is derived spectroscopically ( see below ) .",
    "the stellar parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "transition probabilities for the fe i lines were obtained from several laboratory experiments , including studies of fe i absorption lines produced by iron vapor in a carbon tube furnace @xcite ( oxford group ) , measurement of radiative lifetimes of fe i transitions by laser induced fluorescence @xcite , fe i emission line spectroscopy from a low current arc @xcite , and emission lines of fe i from a shock tube @xcite .",
    "we also considered solar gf ",
    "values from @xcite when needed .",

    "values from @xcite corrected by + 0.05 dex .",

    "our sample contains many stars observed in mutiple orders , with many detectable absorption features in these high s / n spectra .",
    "for example , in the coolest m71 star in our sample , m71 - 1 - 45 , 1407 absorption lines have been identified . a fortran code to automatically search for absorption features and measure their equivalent width ( @xmath12 ) , ewdet , was developed for this project .",
    "the code is available upon request to svr .",
    "ewdet determines the continuum location of the hires spectra by fitting a curve to the spectra performing several iterations of point rejection above and below sigma levels given by the user",
    ". then , ewdet identifies lines above the noise level defined by a factor of two of the continuum rms dispersion .",
    "each of the identified lines is fit by a gaussian profile and then the @xmath12  are computed by the integration of the fitted gaussian .",
    "the error in @xmath12  is computed by adding quadratically the error at each point of integration , @xmath13 , times the step of the integration .",
    "the error at each point of integration is given by : @xmath14\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the gaussian profile , @xmath16 is the peak of the gaussian , @xmath17 is the error in the peak of the gaussian , @xmath18 is the central wavelength of the gaussian , @xmath19 is the error in the central wavelength , @xmath20 is the dispersion of the gaussian , @xmath21 is the error in the dispersion of the gaussian , and @xmath22 is the error in the continuum .",
    "the errors of the gaussian parameters are from the covariance matrix of the gaussian fit .",
    "the expression for the error in @xmath12is deduced by propagating the errors of the gaussian parameters and assuming that the continuum level is equal to one ( see appendix ) .",
    "the fit by a gaussian profile is reasonable even for the strongest lines we use , as shown in figure 1 , where the observed line is plotted with a solid curve and its corresponding gaussian profile fit is shown with a dashed curve .    the line list identified and measured by ewdet is then correlated to the line list with the atomic parameters to specifically identify the fe i and fe ii lines . the detailed lists of @xmath12  and gf  values will be given in the next paper .",
    "the spectral resolution , @xmath23 , of an echelle is fixed , unlike a low incidence , angle of low order grating spectrograph where @xmath24 is constant , independent of @xmath25 .",
    "hence a line of constant central depth , @xmath26 , will have an equivalent width proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "we construct the relationship between @xmath27 and @xmath12  for the fe i lines to look for possible blends and for saturation effects .",
    "the @xmath27 versus @xmath12  relation for three stars are plotted in figure 2 ; m71-i is one of the most luminous and coolest stars of our sample , m71-g53476_4543 is a medium luminosity and temperature star , and m71-g53392_4624 is one of the faintest and hottest stars of the sample .",
    "we fit a second order polynomial to the @xmath28@xmath12  relationship for each star , performing several iterations of point rejection above and below the two sigma level .",
    "the second order term is needed to account for line saturation at large @xmath12  and the rejection of points is needed to eliminate blended lines . the second order fit is plotted as a solid line in figure 2 , and the points considered for such a fit are shown in black .",
    "for fe i , we use two sets of lines .",
    "the first set , subsequently called `` the weak line set '' , contains those fe i lines which are within two sigma levels of the @xmath28@xmath12  fit , have @xmath12  @xmath29 60 m , and have errors less than a third of the @xmath12 .",
    "this set of lines produces a sample of the best weak fe i lines with the most accurate @xmath12  and the abundances derived using them will have a minimal dependence on the choice of microturbulent velocity .",
    "the second set , subsequently called `` the good line set '' , consists of all the fe i lines with errors less than a third of the @xmath12  and with @xmath12   computed from the fit for @xmath28@xmath12  determined for each star . in future papers ,",
    "the @xmath12  of lines of other elements will be determined in the same manner as the fe i lines of `` the good line set '' . this way a consistent comparison can be done among the resulting abundances without a restriction on the strength of the lines used .",
    "the `` weak line set '' is different for each star .",
    "actually the weak lines for the stars near the main sequence are no longer weak for the cooler stars in our sample .",
    "we compare the results from 20 lines common to 15 stars over almost the whole range in @xmath0  with the results from the `` weak line set '' ; there is no difference within the errors , nor a trend in @xmath0 .",
    "for fe ii , the @xmath12  of the lines are also determined using the fit to the @xmath28@xmath12  relation of the fe i lines of `` the good line set '' .",
    "the fe ii lines follow the relationship determined from fe i lines well , as shown in figure 3 . additional fe ii lines ,",
    "not picked up automatically , were measured by hand for the stars near the turn off and for m71-g53425_4612 and m71-g53457_4709 .",
    "the set of @xmath12  for the hand selected fe ii lines is computed from the @xmath28@xmath12  relation of the fe i lines , after determining their observed depth from the spectra .    the number of fe i lines , for both sets of lines , and the number of fe ii lines utilized in this analysis are listed in table 1 .",
    "the effective temperature ( @xmath0 ) of a star can be determined spectroscopically by requiring the abundance to be independent of the lower excitation potential .",
    "this technique can be applied to 20 of our stars where we have fe i lines with enough range in lower excitation potential to do so . for the spectroscopic @xmath0  determination",
    "we are using `` the weak line set '' of fe i lines , because its resulting abundance and spectroscopic @xmath0  will be only weakly dependent on the choice of microturbulent velocity .",
    "we find that the spectroscopic @xmath0  is in good agreement with the photometric @xmath0  derived in paper i , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "the solid line in figure 4 shows the ideal case when the spectroscopic and the photometric @xmath0  are equal .",
    "the scatter around the solid line is about 150 k , which is comparable to the error of the photometric @xmath0  of 75 k for giants and of 150 k for dwarfs ( paper i ) , also shown in figure 4 .",
    "the scatter around the solid line is symmetric , not above or below , indicating the lack of systematic effects with the photometric temperatures .",
    "the microturbulent velocity ( @xmath30 ) of a star can be determined spectroscopically by requiring the abundance to be independent of the strength of the lines measured as the equivalent width .",
    "we apply this technique for both sets of fe i lines .",
    "the resulting @xmath30  and the [ fe / h ]  computed with it for `` the weak line set '' of fe i lines are listed in table 1 .",
    "only 18 of our stars have enough weak fe i lines to derive @xmath30   spectroscopically .",
    "we also compute @xmath30  using all the good fe i lines for 20 of our stars .",
    "the difference of the resulting [ fe / h ]  computed with the derived @xmath30  for the two set of lines is plotted with respect to @xmath0  in figure 5 .",
    "the mean difference is @xmath31 0.011 , hence ,",

    "the relationship between @xmath30  determined for the set of all good fe i lines and the photometric @xmath0  is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a linear least squares fit of the data , excluding the red horizontal branch ( rhb ) stars , marked with circles .",
    "the best fit line is given by : @xmath32 the scatter around the solid line is about 0.2 km  s@xmath33 , which is a reasonable estimation of the error in @xmath30 . for the rest of the analysis , we will use the set of all the good fe i and fe ii lines , with @xmath30  computed from the @xmath30-@xmath0  fit . for the rhb stars we use a value of 1.61 km  s@xmath33 , which corresponds to the mean value determined for the three rhb stars .",
    "the microturbulent velocity used for our stars is listed in table 1 .",
    "given the stellar parameters from table 1 , we determined the iron abundance using the equivalent widths of all the good fe i and fe ii lines identified in the hires spectra .",
    "we employ the grid of stellar atmospheres from @xcite to compute the iron abundance using the four stellar atmosphere models with the closest @xmath0  and log(@xmath2 )  to each star s parameters .",
    "the [ fe / h ]  listed in table 1 is an interpolation of the results from the closest stellar model atmospheres to the appropriate @xmath0  and log(@xmath2 )  for each star .",

    "@xmath0  is used for the x - axis as a convenient parameter for characterizing the position of the stars in the color - magnitude diagram as it also ranks the stars in luminosity ( except for the rhb stars ) .",
    "the errors listed in table 1 correspond to the larger of the statistical uncertainty , given by the standard deviation of the iron abundance from different lines divided by the square root of the number of lines , or a minimum value of 0.03 dex .",
    "these errors are lower limits to the actual uncertainties in the abundances , since they do not include uncertainties due to the stellar parameters nor any systematic effects that might be present .",

    "we estimate the sensitivity of [ fe / h ]  derived from fe ii ines with respect to the stellar parameters in the same manner as the sensitivity of [ fe / h ]  from fe i lines .",
    "the results are listed in table 3 , where the range adopted for each parameter is representative of its uncertainty .",
    "we see a stronger sensitivity on the stellar parameters from the fe ii lines than from the fe i lines .",
