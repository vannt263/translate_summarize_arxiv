    "multicolour imaging linear polarimetry at near - infrared ( near - ir ) wavelengths is a powerful tool for mapping the dusty discs and envelopes that surround young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "the observed flux distributions and the polarization patterns are both influenced by the distribution and properties of the dust grains responsible for the extinction and the scattering of the light . it can be used to determine which source in a given region dominates the illumination .",
    "it can also be used to distinguish between the different mechanisms that produce polarization , since dichroic extinction and scattering processes sometimes produce differing wavelength dependencies .",
    "generally , the scattering pattern associated with spatially resolved ysos is centrosymmetric with aligned vectors in the core of the nebula .",
    "this pattern of aligned vectors is commonly referred to as the polarization disc .",
    "some ysos with resolved nebulae differ from the traditionally expected centrosymmetric pattern by displaying a much broader region of aligned vectors .",
    "the most likely cause of this feature is dichroism due to magnetically aligned non - spherical dust grains in the circumstellar disc .",
    "other proposed methods for producing the aligned vector patter include multiple scattering ( whitney & hartman 1993 ) and `` illusory disc '' , which is an effect caused by limited spatial resolution ( whitney , kenyon & gomez 1997 ; lucas & roche 1998 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     the empirical density equation was used to determine the density distribution .",
    "the power law index was capable of producing acceptable results for k = 0.0@xmath10 .",
    "increasing the power law index ( i.e. the vertical density gradient ) resulted in a decrease in the prominence of the receding lobe .",
    "a more severe flattening of the envelope was not able to reproduce the polarization structure of el29 .",
    "the position angle of the polarization disc was reproduced using dust grains that were aligned with a toroidal magnetic field .",
    "grains aligned with an axial magnetic field were capable of reproducing the vector structure in the outer parts of the polarised flux image but they were not able to reproduce the position angle of the polarization disc . to fit the degree of core polarization , p@xmath2 = 8.3% ,",
    "required that for a maximum grain size of 0.70 @xmath9 m the grain axial ratio be not more than 1.03 for the adopted magnetic field structure .",
    "the larger grain axial ratio models and the spherical grain models resulted in core polarizations that were too high or too low , respectively .",
    "the dust grains were a mixture of silicates and amorphous carbons .",
    "for the adopted system inclination the dust grain albedo needed to be @xmath11 @xmath8 0.4 .",
    "the final model has an albedo of @xmath11 = 0.2 , which provided the best fit to the polarization data . increasing the albedo results in an increase in the prominence of the western ( receding ) lobe .",
    "this model fails to reproduce the point - like flux distribution that we observed for el29 , though we noted in @xmath124.8 that more recent observations have detected the faint extended structure that our model predicts .",
    "one possible reason for the faintness of the extended nebulosity is that the adopted envelope structure assumes that there is an axisymmetric distribution of material throughout .",
    "however , the strongly peaked structure of el29 suggests that there may be a `` hole '' in the material along the line of sight to the protostar .",
    "the near - infrared linear polarization data for a sample of young stellar objects in the @xmath1 ophiuchi star - forming region have been analysed .",
    "the majority of the objects were spatially unresolved .",
    "five of the objects were clearly associated with extended nebulosity : two of these are bipolar nebulae and three have cometary morphologies .",
    "the extended objects have centrosymmetric vector patterns with a polarization disc over the core .",
    "a few of the unresolved objects have polarizations that were too small to detect , with upper limits of 1 - 2% .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the degree of polarization suggests that dichroism is the dominant mechanism responsible for the polarization of light in the unresolved sources , which constitute the majority of the sample .",
    "( the alternative is that these sources have complicated but unresolved polarization structures ) . in the envelopes of the extended sources",
    "the wavelength dependence indicates that scattering dominates the generation of polarized light .",
    "the results of the linear polarimetry survey of @xmath1 oph were compared to the infrared evolutionary status of the objects . it was found that :    * the distribution of the material around the sample sources does not seem to be strongly correlated with the evolutionary scheme determined by the infrared spectral energy distributions .",
    "point - like structures were seen for objects with class i , class ii and class iii designations .",
    "five objects were identified as being associated with extended nebulosity .",
    "the majority of the extended objects were class i but one had a class ii designation . *",
    "the near - infrared colour - colour diagrams show that the degree of core polarization is correlated with the h - k and k - l colours .",
    "* a weak correlation is observed between the size of the extended nebulae and the core polarizations .",
    "* there is a positive correlation between the degree of core polarization and the evolutionary stage indicated by the infrared spectral index .",
    "typically , class i objects show core polarizations in the range 2% @xmath3 p@xmath2 @xmath3 16% , whereas core polarizations in the range 1% @xmath3 p@xmath2",
    "@xmath3 6% are seen for the class ii objects , and the only class iii object in the sample shows pk @xmath3 1% .",
    "it should be noted that the sed - based assignation of classes is influenced by system inclination as well as evolutionary status . * a weaker positive correlation between the maximum polarization assessed over the envelopes and the infrared spectral index was also observed . *",
    "generally , redder sources are associated with higher degrees of core polarization .",
    "those objects that have p@xmath2 @xmath13 5% have ( h - k ) colours greater than 2.5 .",
    "objects with polarizations in the range 1.5% @xmath4 p@xmath2 @xmath4 5% have the greatest range of ( h - k ) colours ( 1 @xmath3 ( h - k ) @xmath3 4.4 ) , and the two objects with p@xmath2 @xmath8 1.5% have ( h - k ) @xmath3 2.2 ( the object with the lowest h - k also has the lowest p@xmath2 ) .",
    "similar correlations have been previously identified for young stellar objects in the taurus region ( whitney , kenyon & gomez 1997 ) .",
    "the results presented in this work for @xmath1 oph and by previous authors for taurus reveal that the polarization data appears to support the evolution of circumstelar matter predicted in models of low - mass star formation .    the shadow.f code was used to model three class i objects in @xmath1 oph that represented a cross - section of the morphologies observed .",
    "the first was the bipolar object ylw16a , the second was the cometary object wly54 , and the third was the point - like object el29 . in each case",
    "a fit to the polarization data was found by assuming that the objects could all be modelled as a bipolar system .    the point - like source el29 displays a bipolar polarization pattern across the image profile .",
    "this was assumed to be the result of diffuse bipolar nebulosity that was only detectable in polarized light .",
    "the presence of diffuse nebulosity has been confirmed by more recent observations .",
    "our model fails to reproduce the point - like total flux distribution but successfully fits the polarized flux distribution and the polarization vector structure .",
    "the results of the modelling revealed that to reproduce the observed total flux distributions and polarization data there were several properties common to the three systems investigated .",
    "these properties are :    * the dust grains that are responsible for the polarization of the light are required to be smaller than the wavelength of observation .",
    "the maximum grain size was found to be 1.05 @xmath9 m . *",
    "the dust grains are either near - spherical or very weakly aligned .",
    "more strongly dichroic grains can only be present if the field structure varies along the line of sight to the protostar in a manner that weakens the measured dichroic extinction effects .",
    "our models assume perfect grain alignment with the magnetic field .",
    "we find that grains with an axial ratio of more than 1.03 led to significantly higher polarizations than the data .",
    "in addition , grains with axial ratios of 1.1 were found to result in little spatial variation in the polarization across the source for parameters that were capable of producing acceptable fits to the flux distributions investigated .",
    "* spherical grain models were successful at reproducing the flux distributions and polarization vector patterns , but they could not successfully reproduce the fractional polarizations measured in the cores of the ysos .",
    "typically , the core polarization provided by a spherical grain model was a tenth of the observed value . * given that some dichroic extinction is required to reproduce the core polarizations , a toroidal magnetic field structure is necessary in the central regions of the nebula in order to reproduce the orientation of the polarization disc parallel to the accretion disc .",
    "we wish to thank the staff of ukirt , which is operated by the joint astronomy centre on behalf of the uk science and technology facilities council ( stfc ) .",
    "stfc has taken over the former astronomy functions of pparc , the particle physics and astronomy research council .",
    "this research was supported by a pparc phd studentship awarded to afb .",
