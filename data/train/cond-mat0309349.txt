    "the long coherence time of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , now routinely produced in many laboratories , offers the possibility to study the collective motion induced by external radiation beams @xcite .",
    "in particular , a single far - off resonance laser sent on an elongated bec produces superradiant rayleigh scattering @xcite , generating coherent backscattered radiation and splitting the condensate into fractions moving at velocities differing by multiples of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the wave - vector of the laser incident along the symmetry axis of the condensate , @xmath2 is the laser frequency and @xmath3 is the atomic mass .",
    "superradiant rayleigh scattering from a bec is the quantum analog of the collective atomic recoil laser ( carl ) @xcite in which the emitted radiation is not confined in a high-@xmath4 ring cavity @xcite .",
    "the complete absence in a bec of doppler broadening due to thermal motion allows for a regime in which the atoms scatter a single laser photon and recoil with an extra momentum of @xmath5 in the direction of the incident photon . the number of scattered photons and the amplitude of the density grating resulting from the interference between the two atomic wavepackets with momentum difference @xmath5",
    "are exponentially enhanced via the carl instability @xcite . in the absence of any mechanism of atomic dephasing ,",
    "the process is sequential @xcite , with a complete transfer of atoms , after the superradiant process , from the original motional state with momentum @xmath6 to a state with a momentum @xmath7 .",
    "however , in a real bec several mechanisms contribute to the decay of the coherence between the two momentum states .",
    "some of them are due to the decoherence induced by spontaneous emission @xcite or phase diffusion @xcite .",
    "the main characteristic of this kind of decoherence is irreversibility .",
    "other mechanisms arise from inhomogeneous broadening , as those due to a finite size of the condensate wavefunction , responsible for a broadening of the atomic momentum distribution , and from mean - field broadening due to the atomic interaction @xcite .",
    "it has been recently suggested that the dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening can be reversed applying , after the superradiant scattering process , a bragg pulse of area @xmath8 inducing a superradiant echo and a further tranfer of the atoms to the final momentum state @xcite . in this paper we investigate the effects of the mean - field atomic interaction on the superradiant scattering process .",
    "we consider an elongated bose - einstein condensate driven by a single laser incident along the positive direction of the symmetry axis @xmath9 of the condensate .",
    "the laser is far - detuned from the atomic resonance , so that radiation pressure due to absorption and subsequent random incoherent , isotropic emission of a photon , can be neglected . in this regime , the atoms backscatter photons at frequency @xmath10 and wave vector @xmath11 , recoiling with a momentum @xmath5 along the same direction of the incident laser beam .    in a simplified 1d description of the process along the axis @xmath9 , the evolution of the matter - wave field @xmath12 and of the dimensionless amplitude @xmath13 of the scattered radiation",

    "the matter - wave field @xmath28 is normalized to one , i.e. @xmath29 , and the last term on the right hand side of eq.([psi ] ) describes the atomic interaction due to binary collisions , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the scattering length and @xmath32 is the condensate cross section .",
    "eq.([a ] ) has been written in the `` mean - field '' limit , which models the propagation effects of the light by replacing the nonuniform electric field by an average value and by adding to the equation a damping term with decay constant @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the condensate length and @xmath35 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
