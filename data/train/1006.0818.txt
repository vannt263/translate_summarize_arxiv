    "high - energy collisions involving atomic nuclei give a unique opportunity to study parton propagation in nuclear matter . deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) on nuclei and the drell - yan ( dy ) process in proton - nucleus collisions",
    "are usually considered to be good probes of parton propagation in cold ( confined ) nuclear matter , whereas large-@xmath2 hadron or jet production in heavy - ion collisions should be sensitive to parton propagation in hot quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "it seems clear that in order to provide a sensible interpretation of the phenomenon of jet - quenching , observed at rhic  @xcite and recently at the lhc  @xcite , and considered as a prominent qgp signal , a good theoretical understanding of parton propagation in cold nuclear matter is required .",
    "an energetic parton travelling in a large nuclear medium undergoes multiple elastic scatterings , which induce gluon radiation . usually , the amount of such gluon radiation is referred to as the ( radiative ) _ energy loss _ of the fast parton , and the notion of parton energy loss has been widely used in phenomenological studies of nuclear effects . for instance , the suppression of production rates in a  a or @xmath1a compared to @xmath1@xmath1 collisions ( after an adequate normalization ) observed for various processes in some kinematical regions ( dis at large @xmath3 , large-@xmath0 dy production in @xmath1a , large-@xmath2 hadron production in a  a ) has been attributed ,",
    "at least partly , to parton energy loss  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , due to parton energy loss , a hard qcd process probes the incoming parton distribution functions ( pdf ) at higher @xmath4 where they are suppressed , leading to nuclear suppression .    however , there exist some hard processes where the medium - induced associated radiation _ can not _ be strictly identified with the energy loss of a well - defined parton .",
    "such processes are those where a color charge ( which may be a composite object ) is produced nearly collinearly with one of the incoming partons ( in the rest frame of the medium , see section  [ sec : frame ] ) , making the gluon emission amplitudes _ before _ and _ after _ the hard production vertex _",
    "coherent_. quite intuitively , the presence of interference precludes the identification between associated radiation and radiation off a well - defined parton . the notion of _ radiated energy _",
    "associated to a hard process is thus more general than the notion of parton energy loss .",
    "the aim of our study is to illustrate the latter statements , using the specific example of large-@xmath0 quarkonium hadroproduction in high - energy @xmath1@xmath1 and @xmath1a collisions .",
    "our main result can be summarized as follows .",
    "the medium - induced gluon radiation associated to large-@xmath0 quarkonium hadroproduction arises from large gluon formation times , scales as the incoming parton energy ( which at large @xmath0 becomes commensurate with the quarkonium energy ) , and can not be identified with the energy loss of a well - defined parton .",
    "however , it is qualitatively similar to the bethe - heitler energy loss of an `` asymptotic '' massive parton .",
    "a similar effect should arise in all processes where a fast color charge is produced nearly collinearly with a fast incoming parton .",
    "for instance , the effect is expected in large-@xmath0 open heavy flavour production , but not in drell - yan production , where the final energetic particle carries no color charge ( see section  [ sec : disc ] for a more detailed discussion ) .    in order to motivate our study ,",
    "let us first shortly review the notion of parton energy loss .",
    "the latter has been extensively studied ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a heuristic review ) .",
    "it is of course of crucial importance to know the correct parametric dependence of the mean parton energy loss @xmath5 , which in general depends on the parton properties ( in particular its energy @xmath6 and mass @xmath7 ) , those of the medium ( its size @xmath8 and density and/or temperature ) , and on the coupling @xmath9 .",
    "but as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the radiative loss of an energetic charged particle also depends on the way the particle is produced .",
    "when discussing radiative energy loss , two physical situations have to be distinguished :    the energetic charge is suddenly accelerated in the medium , at a given initial time @xmath10 ( as in dis for instance ) .",
    "since a suddenly accelerated particle radiates even in vacuum , in this case the relevant quantity to address nuclear suppression is not the total energy loss @xmath5 suffered by the parton , but the additional , _ medium - induced _",
    "loss @xmath11 occurring in the medium when compared to vacuum ;    the energetic charge is an asymptotic particle prepared at @xmath12 and detected at @xmath13 , travelling in the medium between @xmath10 and @xmath14 . in this situation ,",
    "the medium - induced loss coincides with the total loss .",
    "the situation ( ii ) is more natural in qed , where asymptotic charges do exist . in qcd , the only way to `` see '' a color charge is to resolve it inside a colorless hadron , via some hard partonic subprocess .",
    "even in the absence of a nuclear medium , say in @xmath15@xmath1 or @xmath1@xmath1 collisions , the hard process inevitably produces gluon radiation .",
    "thus , the `` medium - induced prescription '' is required , and at first sight , it is the situation ( i ) which is generic in qcd .",
    "for example , in dis ( dy ) production , the medium - induced associated radiation can be identified with the medium - induced energy loss of a quark created ( annihilated ) at @xmath10 , obtained by subtracting the loss associated to the hard process in @xmath15@xmath1 ( @xmath1@xmath1 ) from that in @xmath15a ( @xmath1a ) scattering . large-@xmath2 hadron production around mid - rapidity in a ",
    "a collisions is also sensitive to the medium - induced loss of a parton created at @xmath10 .",
    "( see section  [ sec : largept ] for a discussion of this case . )    however , as mentioned in the beginning , for some hard processes the associated medium - induced radiation does not correspond to the energy loss of a well - defined parton  in either situation ( i ) or ( ii ) . to illustrate this possibility ,",
    "let us consider large-@xmath0 quarkonium hadroproduction , and assume for simplicity that the heavy quark - antiquark @xmath16 pair is dominantly produced through the gluon fusion channel , @xmath17 .. ] when the longitudinal momentum @xmath18 of the @xmath16 pair ( in the nucleus rest frame ) is large compared to its transverse mass m _   , the @xmath16 pair is ultra - relativistic and produced nearly collinearly to the projectile parton .",
    "moreover , at large enough @xmath18 , the @xmath16 pair remains _ compact _ ( of size @xmath19 ) and in a _ color octet _",
    "state for a time @xmath20 , this holds independently of the quarkonium production mechanism .",
    "however , we will moreover assume that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the coherence time of the partonic subprocess .",
    "thus , our general discussion ( see section  [ sec : quarkonium ] ) does not directly apply to the color singlet model ( csm ) for quarkonium production , where @xmath23 .",
    "further comments on the csm and our assumption about @xmath24 will be made in section  [ sec : heavyflav ] .",
    "] as a result of time dilation in the nucleus rest frame . under those conditions ,",
    "the hard production process looks like gluon scattering at small angle in the target rest frame , except that the outgoing `` gluon ''  the octet @xmath16 pair  is massive .",
    "this intuitively explains why the medium - induced radiated energy associated to large-@xmath0 quarkonium hadroproduction is qualitatively similar to the medium - induced energy loss of an `` asymptotic massive parton '' crossing the target nucleus ( see section  [ sec : quarkonium ] ) .",
    "in particular , its scaling as the quarkonium energy might explain the strong nuclear suppression of quarkonium hadroproduction observed at large @xmath0 .    the suppression of @xmath25 production in hadron - nucleus collisions at large @xmath0 has been observed by several experiments , at different collision energies @xmath2640  gev / nucleon and in various nuclear targets  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , its magnitude is similar to that of open charm measured by e866/nusea through single muon production  @xcite , as well as that of light hadrons measured by na49  @xcite at sps and brahms  @xcite at rhic ; in contrast , it proved much stronger than observed in the dy channel  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] , where @xmath25 and dy e866/nusea data are plotted as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath27 ) of @xmath25 ( circles ) and drell - yan ( squares ) production ( @xmath28  gev ) measured in @xmath1a collisions at @xmath29  gev as a function of @xmath0 . e866/nusea data from  @xcite . ]",
    "various explanations have been proposed to account for these measurements .",
    "the comparison of na3  @xcite , e772/e866",
    "@xcite as well as phenix  @xcite measurements allowed to rule out a scaling of @xmath25 suppression in the target parton momentum fraction @xmath30 , indicating a violation of factorization in charm hadroproduction  @xcite . this observation consequently ruled out the nuclear modifications of parton densities in the target as being a dominant effect . on the contrary ,",
    "the observed scaling in either @xmath0 or @xmath31 supported the qualitative predictions of the intrinsic charm picture in which the soft scattering of higher - fock states ( e.g. @xmath32 ) on the nucleus leads to @xmath33 scaling ( @xmath34 ) at large @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "although intrinsic charm might contribute significantly to the observed @xmath25 suppression even at rather small @xmath0 , its sole effect can not explain the data given the present constraints on the amount of charm in the proton  @xcite .",
    "the inelastic interaction of the @xmath35 pair with nuclear matter seems also disfavoured , since it would require unrealistically large cross sections  @xcite ; also , @xmath25 nuclear absorption models would naturally lead to @xmath30 scaling  @xcite unlike what is observed experimentally .",
    "it has also been suggested by gavin and milana ( gm ) that parton energy loss in nuclear matter might be the dominant effect responsible for both dy and @xmath25 suppression  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the present paper should resolve some confusion concerning their explanation . in the gm model ,",
    "the energy loss is assumed to scale with the incoming parton energy ( without real justification ) , @xmath36 , leading to a shift @xmath37 in the projectile pdf .",
    "this is a key assumption in order to reproduce the qualitative trend of the data .",
    "if , on the contrary , energy loss was _ independent _ of the parton energy , the shift in the momentum fraction would not depend on @xmath31 , thus leading to a less steep @xmath25 suppression as a function of @xmath31 , unlike the trend of the data  @xcite .",
    "the stronger @xmath25 suppression , compared to that of dy , arises from several effects in gm  @xcite . since @xmath25 production proceeds mostly via gluon fusion ( at not too large @xmath0 ) , the typical energy loss is expected to be larger than for quarks by a factor @xmath38 .",
    "another effect comes from the large-@xmath4 pdf being steeper for gluons than for quarks .",
    "finally , the produced @xmath35 pair produced at large @xmath0 travels as a color octet through the nucleus , thus _ losing energy as a gluon _ provided the multiple collisions in the final state do not resolve the @xmath39 pair .",
    "the latter effect appears to be quantitatively crucial as it accounts for more than half of the @xmath25 suppression . in summary , in the gm model , @xmath25 suppression is due to the initial ( quark or gluon ) and final ( color octet @xmath35 pair ) in - medium energy losses _ added incoherently_.    with this in mind , it seems clear that the `` parton energy loss '' implied in the gm model refers to the medium - induced energy loss of a color charge created ( or annihilated ) at the hard production time @xmath10 , _ i.e. _ , to the situation ( i ) defined previously .",
    "as we will now recall , such parton energy loss does not scale with the parton energy @xmath6 when @xmath40 ( all other scales being fixed ) , which apparently rules out the gavin - milana model . consider a parton created at some given time @xmath10 .",
    "as already mentioned , the initial acceleration produces radiation since the initially bare parton progressively builds its proper field , a process which goes along with associated radiation .",
    "this happens even when the parton is created in vacuum . in the presence of a nuclear medium ,",
    "the medium - induced radiation arises due to the rescatterings off target partons shaking off the components of the parton proper field just built . over the distance @xmath8 ,",
    "only the components of the proper field which are already formed can be shaken off , hence the medium - induced radiation must satisfy the constraint t_f ~ l , [ constraint ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the radiated gluon energy and transverse momentum , @xmath43 the emission angle , and @xmath44 the gluon formation time .",
    "the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) yields a bound on parton energy loss , as first derived by brodsky and hoyer  @xcite , @xmath45 . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the latter bound is a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle , @xmath46 , implying that some radiation can be released over the length @xmath8 provided the emission process involves a large enough longitudinal momentum transfer , @xmath47 . with @xmath48 , one recovers ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "we stress that the brodsky - hoyer bound applies to situation ( i ) , _ i.e. _ , to the medium - induced energy loss of a parton created ( or annihilated ) in the medium .",
    "in this situation , the medium - induced radiation _ probes _ the medium size @xmath8 , as stated by ( [ constraint ] ) . in other words , large formation times @xmath49 cancel out in the medium - induced loss .",
    "those statements were later confirmed by explicit calculations of the medium - induced radiative loss of a parton created in a medium , showing that @xmath50 when @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "as legitimately claimed by brodsky and hoyer  @xcite , the bound on parton energy loss seems to rule out the gavin - milana `` energy loss explanation '' of @xmath25 nuclear suppression ( which uses _ ad hoc _ parton energy losses corresponding to situation ( i ) and nevertheless scaling as @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , we believe this conclusion relies on a misinterpretation of the physics at work . as we already emphasized , large-@xmath51 quarkonium production is a process where the emission amplitudes off the nearly collinear incoming and outgoing color charges strongly interfere .",
    "thus , the gluon radiation spectrum associated to the hard process can not be identified with the radiation spectrum off a well - defined parton ( or with the incoherent sum of such spectra ) , contrary to what is assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this is best illustrated by our calculation of section  [ sec : largexf ] , where large-@xmath0 quarkonium production is modelled by a simple qed process , where an energetic muon of mass @xmath7 is produced in the hard scattering of an incoming electron of mass @xmath52 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : qedlargexf ] . the ( photon ) radiation spectrum associated to the hard process in a @xmath1@xmath1 collision",
    "is given by ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : qedlargexfrad ] and ( [ ppspec - largexf ] ) ) .",
    "|_pp & & , [ intro - ppspec - largexf ] where the last term stands for the interference alluded to above , @xmath53 denotes the angle of the final muon with respect to the incoming electron , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the radiation spectrum is similar to the bethe - heitler spectrum of an asymptotic charge of mass @xmath7 undergoing a scattering of angle @xmath56 , see ( [ specasymmuon2 ] ) , the latter being approximately obtained by setting @xmath57 in ( [ intro - ppspec - largexf ] ) .",
    "although the associated spectrum ( [ intro - ppspec - largexf ] ) and bethe - heitler spectrum are not strictly identical , they share the same property which is essential to our discussion . they both arise from large photon formation times , @xmath58 , resulting in an integrated spectrum scaling as @xmath6 .    obviously , the same is true for the spectrum associated to the hard process in a @xmath1a collision , obtained from ( [ intro - ppspec - largexf ] ) by the substitution @xmath59 ( see ( [ paspec - largexf ] ) ) , .",
    "[ intro - paspec - largexf ] our main observation is that the _ medium - induced _ spectrum , obtained by subtracting ( [ intro - ppspec - largexf ] ) from ( [ intro - paspec - largexf ] ) , also arises from large formation times @xmath49 , and moreover solely from the interference terms , .",
    "|_ind , [ intro - indspeclargexf3 ] where @xmath60 . as a consequence ,",
    "the medium - induced radiated energy associated to the large-@xmath0 production process scales as the energy @xmath6 of the incoming charge , similarly to bethe - heitler radiation .",
    "this conclusion trivially generalizes to the qcd case of quarkonium hadroproduction ( see section  [ sec : quarkonium ] ) .",
    "thus , the gavin - milana assumption of an `` energy loss '' scaling as @xmath6 turns out to be valid for quarkonium production , , where no energetic and quasi - collinear color charge is produced in the final state . the radiated energy associated to the drell - yan process can thus be identified with the energy loss of the incoming and suddenly decelerated quark , see section  [ sec : dy ] . ]",
    "provided this `` energy loss '' is correctly interpreted as the radiated energy associated to the hard process , and not as the energy loss of independent incoming and outgoing color charges .",
    "the medium - induced radiated energy is parametrically similar to the bethe - heitler energy loss of a charge of mass @xmath7 created in the far past , in particular it arises from large formation times , and the brodsky - hoyer bound does not apply in this case .    one might wonder why large formation times @xmath49 do not cancel out in the medium - induced radiation , as in the case of a parton created in a medium ( see ( [ constraint ] ) ) .",
    "radiation associated with @xmath49 does not _",
    "resolve _ the medium , but this does not always imply that the radiation is independent of the medium size and properties . for a parton created in the medium , it does .",
    "indeed , in this case , radiation with @xmath49 solely arises from late emission off the _ final _ charged particle , and is the same with or without medium .",
    "this is why formation times @xmath49 cancel out in the medium - induced energy loss of a parton created in the medium . in the case of large-@xmath0 quarkonium hadroproduction ( and similarly , in the case of bethe - heitler radiation off an asymptotic charge ) , although radiation with @xmath49 does not resolve the medium and sees it as a pointlike object , it however depends on the medium size via the transverse momentum broadening @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the contribution with @xmath49 does _ not _ cancel in the medium - induced radiation associated to large-@xmath0 quarkonium hadroproduction , contrary to what is assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effect discussed here differs from that studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in those studies , the nuclear suppression at large @xmath0",
    "is explained from simple energy conservation arguments . in the limit @xmath62 , the production of additional particles",
    "is forbidden , and each rescattering of the ( initial and/or final ) energetic parton is associated to a sudakov factor @xmath63 .",
    "since there are more rescatterings in a nucleus than in a proton target , this naturally leads to nuclear suppression at large @xmath0 .",
    "this effect appears for all processes , including those ( like dis and dy production ) where no energetic color charge is present in the initial or final state of the hard subprocess .",
    "it is argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that the effect acts similarly to an _ effective _ parton energy loss scaling as the parton energy , independently of the process under consideration .",
    "this is clearly different from the actual parton energy loss ( and more generally associated radiation ) studied in the present paper .",
    "although energy conservation is obviously more and more important when @xmath0 approaches unity and has to be implemented in any realistic phenomenological model , we expect our effect to play a crucial role even far away from the edge of phase - space and therefore independently of the constraints from energy conservation .",
    "the implications of our results on phenomenology will be studied in a future work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : hardproc ] we discuss the radiated energy associated to a hard process , in a simple qed model . in section  [ sec : largept ] we consider the case of large angle scattering , where the radiated energy can be identified with the energy loss of a given charge , as commonly assumed . in section  [ sec : largexf ] , we present a simple , small - angle scattering process where this identification is not possible due to the presence of interference between initial and final state radiation .",
    "this situation is generalized in section  [ sec : quarkonium ] to the qcd case of large-@xmath0 quarkonium hadroproduction , where we obtain the non - abelian analog of ( [ intro - indspeclargexf3 ] ) for the medium - induced radiation spectrum .",
    "some more detailed questions , such as the dependence of our results on the precise quarkonium production mechanism , as well as the comparison with other processes ( e.g. open heavy flavour and light hadron production ) are addressed in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "in the following discussion we shall consider the medium - induced gluon radiation spectrum , @xmath64 , arising from the transverse momentum broadening of partons propagating through a qcd medium .",
    "the natural lorentz frame to study this problem is therefore the frame in which the medium is _",
    "static _ , denoted by ( s ) .",
    "this frame is different whether parton propagation occurs in hot quark - gluon plasma ( a  a collisions ) or cold nuclear matter ( say , @xmath1a collisions ) . in the former case ,",
    "the frame ( s ) is the center - of - mass frame of the heavy - ion reaction , neglecting for simplicity the longitudinal and transverse expansion of the plasma .",

    "the hard partonic process is modelled by an incoming electron , of mass @xmath52 and energy @xmath66 , scattering at large angle ( @xmath67 in the frame ( s ) ) . the photon radiation spectrum associated to the hard process",
    "is obtained by calculating the photon emission amplitudes off the incoming and outgoing electron lines represented in fig  [ fig : pplargept - radamp ] .    @xmath1 '' collisions .",
    "the blob represents the hard process , the photon is radiated by the incoming ( left ) and outgoing ( right ) electron . ]    in the limit of soft photon energy @xmath68 , the photon emission vertices factorize from the hard amplitude , and one can write the photon radiation intensity as di = _ i=1,2 e^2 | - |^2 , [ photonintensity ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the four - momenta of the incoming and outgoing electrons , @xmath71 is the photon four - momentum , @xmath72 are two transverse photon polarization vectors , and @xmath15 is the qed coupling .",

    "the radiation spectrum associated to large angle scattering is given , in the leading logarithmic approximation , by the sum of emission spectra of well - identified `` partons '' , namely those of an incoming ( suddenly decelerated ) and outgoing ( suddenly accelerated ) electron .",

    "the identification between radiation associated to large angle scattering and parton radiation trivially extends to the case of heavy - ion collisions .",

    "as in the vacuum case , the spectrum is dominated by the collinear logarithms of the squared terms , and thus by large photon formation times @xmath49 .    in the phenomenological analyses of nuclear effects , production rates in a ",
    "a collisions are normalized by the similar rates in @xmath1@xmath1 collisions",
    ". then , jet - quenching does not depend on the total radiation associated to the hard process , but rather on the _ additional _ radiation occurring with a medium , when compared to the `` vacuum '' , @xmath1@xmath1 case . in the following",
    "we will focus on the so - called _ medium - induced _ radiation spectrum , obtained by subtracting the vacuum contribution from the in - medium spectrum . subtracting ( [ softspec ] ) from ( [ softspecmed ] ) ,",
    "the dominant ( collinear ) terms cancel out , removing the contribution of large formation times @xmath49 in the induced spectrum .",
    "hence , the _ medium - induced _ radiation associated to large angle scattering must originate from photons with limited formation time , @xmath92 . since the expression ( [ softspecmed ] ) was obtained assuming that large formation times dominate , it is not adequate to derive the medium - induced spectrum .",

    "photons with @xmath92 can probe the medium size @xmath8 , and the radiation amplitude off the scattered electron is not simply given by the coupling to the external lines .",
    "in general the induced spectrum depends on the details of the electron rescatterings in the medium . for the purpose of the present discussion it is sufficient to consider the case of a small medium of size @xmath93 , with @xmath94",
    "the electron mean free path in the medium , so that the scattered electron undergoes at most one elastic scattering .",

    "the medium - induced radiated energy is similar to the medium - induced _ energy loss _ of an asymptotic charge , in particular it scales as the energy , which might have important consequences on the phenomenology .    in this section",
    "we discuss various hard processes off nuclear targets and examine for each of them whether the medium - induced energy loss is similar to that of an asymptotic charge or not .",
    "the quantitative effects of medium - induced gluon radiation on large-@xmath0 quarkonium , open heavy flavour , and light hadron hadroproduction will be addressed in a future study . since the gluon radiation spectra associated to these processes are similar ( they only differ by the precise value of the scales @xmath218 and @xmath219 appearing in ( [ corrected - spectrum ] ) )",
    ", we anticipate that similar ( and large ) nuclear suppressions will be obtained in those cases .      in dis on nuclei ,",
    "the medium - induced energy loss is that of the parton knocked by the virtual photon . in this case",
    ", the expected energy loss is that of a charged particle produced at @xmath10 , as assumed in various phenomenological analyses  @xcite .    the situation is a little more complex in photoproduction reactions .",
    "as long as the initial photon directly couples to the quark in the target nucleus ( at leading order ) , the process resembles dis and the energy loss is that of the struck quark . in photoproduction",
    "however , the hadronic structure of the photon can also be resolved : in this case a colored parton stemming from the photon participates to the hard scattering dynamics , making resolved photoproduction very similar to hadroproduction . since the time scale to resolve the parton inside the photon is typically much larger than the time at which the hard process occurs , one could expect an interference between the emission amplitudes off the initial and final - state parton , leading to a medium - induced energy loss ( or , more accurately , radiated energy ) scaling like the parton energy . in this respect",
    ", it would be extremely valuable to investigate the nuclear dependence of forward jet and hadron production in direct _ vs. _ resolved photoproduction in nuclei .",
    "as already mentioned , in the absence of color charge in the partonic final state , the energy loss in drell - yan production is expected to be that of a suddenly decelerated parton , _",
    "i.e. _ , independent of its energy , is found in dy production , in apparent contradiction with the brodsky - hoyer bound ( see ( [ constraint ] ) ) which should apply in this case .",
    "] as is the case in large angle scattering ( section  [ sec : largept ] ) .",
    "the consequence is that the effects of energy loss should play almost no role in drell - yan production in high - energy @xmath1a collisions , unlike what is assumed in the model by gavin and milana  @xcite .",
    "the energy loss scaling as @xmath6 would come into play only if _ another _ energetic charged particle is produced in the final - state , in association with the virtual photon .",
    "such a situation occurs in dy+jet production in @xmath1a or a  a collisions , with the jet produced at large rapidity .      in the case of large-@xmath0 quarkonium hadroproduction , our result ( [ quarkoniumloss ] ) holds provided gluon radiation has time to be formed before the @xmath16 pair turns color singlet , see ( [ tfassumption ] ) .",
    "as we mentioned in section  [ sec : iiia ] , this assumption is justified in the cem and com ( provided color octet contributions to quarkonium production dominate in the latter case ) . as a consequence",
    ", one could expect in this case a different nuclear dependence of quarkonium hadroproduction at large @xmath0 and quarkonium photoproduction at large @xmath3 ( see section  [ sec : dis ] ) .    however , we should recall that the precise dynamics of quarkonium production is still unknown . indeed",
    ", no proposed model can explain all features of the data on quarkonium production .",
    "although the csm alone seems to be ruled out by hadroproduction data , it is worth keeping in mind that color singlet contributions might not be negligible in some kinematical regions  @xcite .",
    "we have to stress that our main result ( [ spectrum - omegahat ] ) ( or more accurately ( [ corrected - spectrum ] ) ) does not apply to such color singlet contributions , for which @xmath220 , in contrast to our assumption ( [ tfassumption ] ) . in the csm ,",
    "the outgoing color octet @xmath16 pair is too short - lived to allow for our interference contribution to gluon radiation . however , depending on the quarkonium quantum numbers , the csm may require the quarkonium bound state to be produced _ in conjunction _ with a hard gluon , as for instance in @xmath221 production . in this case , the hard process looks like small angle scattering of an energetic color charge  even though the final charge ( the hard gluon ) is distinct from the triggered @xmath16 pair . the medium - induced radiation spectrum ( [ corrected - spectrum ] ) , with @xmath6 interpreted as the energy of the hard gluon ( and @xmath7 set to zero in the expression of @xmath201 ) , might thus indirectly affect the @xmath221 production rate .",
    "in other cases , like @xmath222 production in the csm , where no associated hard gluon is required ( at leading order in @xmath9 ) , the radiation spectrum ( [ corrected - spectrum ] ) will not apply .    in the com the @xmath222 state   which radiative decays contribute quite significantly to @xmath25 production  ",
    "is produced predominantly as a color singlet object .",
    "therefore , we do not expect our result ( [ quarkoniumloss ] ) to apply to this state , leading to a much smaller @xmath222 suppression ( as compared to @xmath25 ) at large @xmath0 .",
    "this prediction , which could be tested at fixed - target experiments at fermilab  @xcite , is at variance with other nuclear effects such as nuclear pdf effects or intrinsic charm which do not depend on the identity of the final charmonium state  @xcite .",
    "another prediction can be made regarding the @xmath223 suppression . from the mean radiated energy ( [ quarkoniumloss ] ) , @xmath224 , the suppression of @xmath223 production , for which no measurements have been performed yet at large @xmath0 ,",
    "is expected to be less pronounced than that of @xmath25 .",
    "we expect the medium - induced radiation spectrum ( [ corrected - spectrum ] ) to be valid in _",
    "open _ heavy flavour hadroproduction at large @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the fact that in this process the final energetic heavy quark does not have the same color charge as the octet @xmath16 pair in quarkonium production does not affect our conclusions . as mentioned in the introduction , the similar suppression of @xmath25 production and single muon ( coming from @xmath225-decays ) production in @xmath1a collisions as a function of rapidity  @xcite supports this picture .      unlike dis , drell - yan and heavy - flavour production , in the case of _ light _ hadron production at large @xmath0 there is no natural hard scale , except if the final hadron transverse momentum in a @xmath1@xmath1 collision is large enough , @xmath226 , in which case a perturbative description might hold .",
    "regarding the expected medium - induced radiation spectrum , different cases might occur depending on the actual definition of the observable :    * the suppression is defined as the ( normalized ) ratio of the light hadron rate in @xmath1a ( or a  a ) collisions over @xmath1@xmath1 collisions at the same , _ fixed _ @xmath227 . in this case",
    ", the interference term in the induced radiation spectrum vanishes from the actual definition of the observable , see the qed expressions eqs .",
    "( [ intro - ppspec - largexf ] ) and  ( [ intro - paspec - largexf ] ) , or set @xmath228 in the gluon radiation spectrum ( [ indspec - quarkonium - final ] ) .",
    "there will nevertheless be some energy loss effect due to rescattering in the medium .",
    "however , in this case the energy loss will be dominated by the radiation of gluons which resolve the medium ( _ i.e. _ , with a formation time of the order of the medium size @xmath8 ) and will not scale as the parton energy ; * the light - hadron suppression in @xmath1a or a  a collisions is defined as the ( normalized ) ratio of the light - hadron production rate _ integrated _ over all transverse momenta ( with an appropriate infrared cut - off ) . in that case , @xmath227 is no longer required , leading to a potentially large energy loss proportional to the parton energy .",
    "the induced gluon spectrum is then obtained by setting @xmath229 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath230 in ( [ corrected - spectrum ] ) .    in the case of the brahms experiment at rhic  @xcite ,",
    "the quenching factor for all charged hadrons in @xmath231au compared to @xmath1@xmath1 collisions at @xmath232  gev / nucleon and at forward rapidity ( @xmath233 ) is measured at fixed hadron transverse momentum @xmath2 , which therefore looks like case ( i ) above . however note that the final parton transverse momentum is smeared because of the fragmentation process in qcd . whenever the _ typical dispersion _ of the parton transverse momentum is large ( as compared to the momentum broadening @xmath202 ) , we no longer have @xmath227 and the energy loss might scale with the parton energy @xmath234 .",
    "another reason why comparing at fixed @xmath235 might nevertheless induce an energy loss similar to that of asymptotic partons is the binning used in the experiment .",
    "as long as the typical size of the @xmath2-bin is large as compared to the nuclear broadening , this case is similar to an _ integrated _ distribution over the transverse momenta , _",
    "i.e. _ , to case ( ii ) .",
    "the na49 experiment at sps also measured the @xmath0-differential production cross section of light hadrons in @xmath1@xmath1 and @xmath1a collisions and integrated over all transverse momenta  @xcite , which corresponds to the case ( ii ) above .",
    "the strong suppression observed at large @xmath0 therefore appears qualitatively consistent with our expectation  -cut has been applied , making these data possibly sensitive to non - perturbative dynamics . ] .",
    "as already mentioned , the notion of _ parton energy loss _ is not general enough to apply to the situations with an important interference between initial and final state radiation , where the associated _ radiated energy _ should instead be considered . quite interestingly ,",
    "when progressively going from large @xmath0 ( or large rapidity ) to the central rapidity region , we expect a transition between a regime where the ( average ) medium - induced radiated energy scales as @xmath6 and a regime where it does not",
    ". it would be interesting to single out some production process where such a transition can be put in evidence . in this respect ,",
    "the rhic data on quarkonium suppression in nuclear collisions appear very promising .",
    "the phenix collaboration reported a stronger @xmath25 suppression at forward rapidity than at mid - rapidity in @xmath231au  @xcite and also au ",
    "au collisions  @xcite , unlike the models based on quarkonium dissociation in qgp .",
    "another observation , reported by star , is the smaller @xmath25 suppression when going from low to high @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "both measurements seem consistent with such a transition between the two identified regimes .",
    "more generally , we mentioned that some apparently unrelated nuclear suppression effects ( jet - quenching in a  a collisions , open and hidden heavy - flavour and light - hadron production in @xmath1a ) might be explained in a unified framework .",
    "we also pointed out in the introduction that the scaling @xmath36 predicted in the present paper for @xmath25 forward production would lead to the scaling of @xmath25 suppression with @xmath31 ( or @xmath0 ) independently of the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath236 of the @xmath1a collision , as observed experimentally . on the contrary ,",
    "an energy loss independent of the parton energy  as for instance in drell - yan production  would lead to a stronger nuclear suppression at lower beam energy , since the typical shift of the momentum fraction in the proton pdf would scale like @xmath237 causing a breakdown of @xmath31 ( or @xmath0 ) scaling . unlike the gm model we do not expect any scaling of dy suppression in either @xmath31 or @xmath0 variables . lacking precise dy measurements at various beam energies ,",
    "this prediction has not been tested yet .",
    "the future data to be collected by the e906 experiment ( @xmath238  gev )  @xcite at fermilab and possibly at j - parc ( @xmath239  gev )  @xcite will allow for crucial tests of the energy loss effects discussed in this paper , both in dy and @xmath25 production .    on a more theoretical ground",
    ", it would be valuable to study how our results are related to qcd factorization issues .",
    "the physics described in our study is clearly of collinear nature , as can be seen for instance from the divergence of our result ( [ indspec - quarkonium - final ] ) ( or its abelian version ( [ indspeclargexf3-b ] ) ) in the formal limit @xmath240 .",
    "however , as we already mentioned , our analysis requires @xmath241 , @xmath190 , so that the kinematics of the hard process is not affected by ( soft ) radiation and rescatterings . as a consequence ,",
    "the average radiated energy is suppressed by a power of @xmath163 ( see ( [ largexfelectronloss ] ) and ( [ quarkoniumloss ] ) ) , _ i.e. _ , it is of higher - twist .",
    "thus , our results should not conflict with leading - twist collinear factorization  @xcite .",
    "however , we do not see why our effect should disappear when the kinematics is extended to the domain where @xmath163 , @xmath190 and @xmath42 are of the same order .",
    "as already mentioned , in qed one may consider the incoming and outgoing energetic particles participating to the hard process to carry different charges @xmath15 and @xmath149 .",
    "the fact that the medium - induced radiation spectrum ( [ indspeclargexf3-b ] ) is then proportional to @xmath150 suggests that the effect can not be attributed to any purely initial ( parton density ) or final ( fragmentation ) effect .",
    "for the same reason , that the effect could be part of other ( more general ) universal objects , such as parton correlation functions ( _ i.e. _ , fully unintegrated parton densities )  @xcite , seems also unlikely .",
    "it has been recently argued that factorization ( even in a generalized , @xmath242-dependent formulation ) is most probably violated in some cases , for instance in the production of large-@xmath243 back - to - back hadrons in hadron - hadron collisions  @xcite .",
    "similarly , it is plausible that hard - scattering factorization is truly violated in the small angle scattering process we have considered in the present study .        , s.  s. adler _",
