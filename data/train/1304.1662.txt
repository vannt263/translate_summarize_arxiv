    ".    it should be clear that building up an @xmath17-cube inductively as maps of these absolutely cartesian squares and compositions of such cubes will yield an absolutely cartesian @xmath17-cube , which is the @xmath19 direction of the if and only if . to be clear , two cubes @xmath20",
    "may be composed if they can be written @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; their composition is then @xmath23 .",
    "geometrically , this looks like `` glueing '' the cubes along their shared face .",
    "we give an example in the next section . by chain of compositions ,",
    "we mean compositions of possibly more than two cubes , e.g. @xmath24 where @xmath25 are all @xmath17-cubes built inductively up from maps of absolutely cartesian squares .",
    "it is not yet certain if the other direction is true .",
    "we may observe that the absolutely cartesian squares are also absolutely cocartesian .",
    "thus , we make an additional conjecture that    [ conj2 ] an @xmath17-cube is absolutely cartesian if and only if it is absolutely cocartesian .",
    "if we include contravariant functors , we can show this conjecture for @xmath26 , and we will comment on this after the proof for cartesian squares , which is in the following section .",
    "we will present partial results towards conjecture [ conj2 ] in section [ sec : conj2 ] ; this includes a positive verification of the conjecture when restricting to functors which land in 1-connected spaces ( including the identity implies that the spaces in the diagram must originally be 1-connected as well ) .    the section after that is about a family of 3-cubes which are absolutely cocartesian and cartesian and which are not expressible as a map of two absolute cartesian squares , but as a composition of 3-cubes of that form .",
    "we end with applications and related work .",
    "this relies on switching briefly to the setting of spectra and using this to deduce properties of the original diagram of spaces .",
    "we also point out that it suffices to prove that either @xmath27 or @xmath28 is an equivalence , since equivalences are stable under homotopy pullback .",
    "that is , it implies that the mirroring map , @xmath29 or @xmath30 , is also an equivalence .",
    "consider an absolutely cartesian square of spaces : @xmath16 \\ar[d ] & b \\ar[d]\\\\ c \\ar[r ] & d\\\\ } \\ ] ]    now apply the functor @xmath31 to our square : @xmath32 \\ar[d ] & \\sigma^{\\infty}{\\text{map}}(d , b ) \\ar[d]\\\\ \\sigma^{\\infty}{\\text{map}}(d , c ) \\ar[r ] & \\sigma^{\\infty}{\\text{map}}(d , d)\\\\ } \\ ] ]    by assumption , this resultant square is still cartesian .",
    "since the square is in spectra , we know that it is also cocartesian . recall that @xmath33 commutes with colimits .",
    "we then have the following chain of equivalences : @xmath34 & & { \\mathbb{z}}[\\pi_0 { \\text{map}}(d , d)]\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ]    we can interpret this as telling us that @xmath35 surjects onto @xmath36 . consider @xmath37 .",
    "this then has a preimage ( up to homotopy ) in @xmath38 and/or @xmath39 ; assume @xmath38 .",
    "this gives a section @xmath40 .",

    "if the section is to @xmath46 , we are done , as we already have a splitting from @xmath46 to @xmath45 and having another the other direction gives us an equivalence between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "these are stable under pullback , meaning that the identity map @xmath50 is pulled back , this time to the `` top '' .",

    "we get a section @xmath52 or @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath30 is a section , we are done  the one - sided inverse ( our original section )",
