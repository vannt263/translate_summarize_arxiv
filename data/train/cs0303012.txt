    "this paper considers approaches to the problem of optimization of proxy cache construction based on theoretical and experimental study . until recently ,",
    "caching was an optional service for users who voluntary configured their browsers to redirect request through a proxy .",
    "the internet service providers interpose the caching systems in the strategic places at the organization boundaries .    in experimental research of the cache systems and construction of the mathematical models",
    "should lead to the growth of the caching effectiveness with minimal financial expenditures . a better algorithm that increases hit ratios by only several percent",
    "would be equivalent to a multiple growth in cache size . in order to find the optimal cache size kelly and reeves  @xcite",
    "are guided on economical methods like monetary cost of memory and bandwidth .",
    "our analysis is based on the model presented by breslau et al .",
    "@xcite and extended by wolman et al .",
    "@xcite to incorporate the steady - state behavior and documents rate of change .",
    "one difficulty in the study of web caching is that there are many cache replacement policies and many factors affecting their performance .",
    "wolman et al . parameterized the model using population size , population request rate , document rate of change , size of object universe , and popularity distribution of objects .",
    "several researchers  @xcite include additional factors like object size , miss penalty , temporal locality , and long - term access frequency .",
    "our research allows the calculation of the lower limit of the cache size corresponding to aggregated bandwidth of external links when performance mount to the effective level equal to 35% .    such an approach can be easily generalized to describe any applications based on zipf - like distribution such as content distribution networks ( cdn )  @xcite , peer - to - peer systems  @xcite , internet search engines , etc .",
    "the paper investigates how the different parameters of proxy cache influence on its performance .",
    "the methods of the measurements including the treatment of experimental data and analytical formulas for calculations are discussed .",
    "the correlations between the significant parameters are investigated and the corresponding figures and tables are constructed .",
    "on the basis of the new experimental data the analytical model is modernized and the addition to the cache construction and to replacement algorithm is proposed .",
    "special consideration is given to the modification of the key formulas introduced by wolman at al .",
    "in order to describe the renewal effect of web documents in the global network the alternative model is developed .",
    "the document rate of change @xmath0 is supposed to depend on popularity index @xmath1 so the zipf - like distribution with the new exponent @xmath2 describes the mentioned effects of the wolman at al . model . as a result of the special experiment the values of exponents @xmath3 , @xmath2 and of the document rates of change @xmath4 , @xmath5 are calculated .",
    "the scheme of the web caching could be presented in the following way : there are users which send requests to the global network and receive information through a cache system as it is shown on the fig .",
    "[ scheme - e ] .",
    "some documents are requested repeatedly and therefore they should be held in the cache system .",
    "the relative frequency  @xcite of requests to web pages follows zipf - like distribution  @xcite .",
    "this distribution states that the relative probability of a request for the @xmath1th most popular page is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the probability of the most popular item and @xmath3 is a positive exponential value less then unity .",
    "we proponed the following test : the size of proxy cache @xmath8 was varying .",
    "these values correspond to incoming traffic for one , two , three , and six days .",
    "all types of documents both cacheable and uncacheble are taken into account for calculating the ratio @xmath9 .",
    "the network of samara state aerospace university has been chosen as an experimental field .",
    "the proxy cache of ssau is a two - processor linux server with squid proxy installed .",
    "all hierarchical links were disconnected before the experiment began .",
    "the statistics of requests for the long time @xmath10 were collected for each point .    in order to modify the model proposed by wolman at al .",
    "we collected the requests during the time @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath12 is the mean lifetime of those documents , who s popularity is @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the primary results of experiments are summarized in the table  [ pr ] , where the following notations and abridgements are used :    * the variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the incoming and the outgoing request s streams of cache proxy as it is shown on the fig .",
    "[ scheme - e ] .",
    "they are measured as the number of users requests per day ( rpd - request per day ) .",
    "it should be noted that the variable @xmath17 describes the request stream from a collective user that is a significant parameter of the wolman at al . model .",
    "* @xmath18 is the performance of the cache system or , in other words , hit ratio . * the same variables with upper index",
    "@xmath19 describe the system in the units of transmitting traffic ( @xmath20 - kbit per second ) .",
    "* @xmath21 is the mean size of documents received from the global network directly .",
    "* @xmath22 is the mean size of documents from the cache . *",
    "finally , the time @xmath23 corresponds to the quantity of days when statistics are collected .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the key difference between our analytical model and presented by wolman at al .",
    "model are :    * the document rate of change @xmath0 is described by continuous variables that depend on popularity @xmath1 .",
    "wolman et al .",
    "assume that the document rate of change @xmath24 takes two different values , one for popular documents @xmath4 and another for unpopular documents @xmath5 .",
    "* the renewal of web documents is incorporated in a steady - state process as a zipf - like distribution with a small @xmath2 .",
    "* we assume also that size of cache system is restricted . * a considerable part of cacheable documents @xmath25 are requested from the global network only one time accordingly to zipf - like distribution . the more accurate expression for an ideal hit ratio @xmath26 has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath27 it has to be modified to taking into account the renewal effect : @xmath28    two types of correlations pretend to a role of fundamental laws that describe cache systems  @xcite :    * a zipf - like distribution , see eq .",
    "( [ zipf - gen ] ) * normalizing conditions or a sum of the probability to request the universe of @xmath29 objects .    the above mentioned laws could be applied to the special points of zipf distribution and two of them , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are used for the construction of the theory .",
    "then the zipf - like distribution leads to @xmath32 normalizing conditions for the first @xmath30 and @xmath31 documents from cache give @xmath33 here @xmath26 is an ideal ( steady - state ) performance for cacheable documents . for a real system the eq .",
    "( [ hi - n ] ) has been transformed to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of cache objects in the kernel .",
    "it is important that zipf exponent @xmath3 grows as the experiment time @xmath23 increases .",
    "the aim of this paper is a study of a web cache system in order to optimize proxy cache systems and to modernize construction principles .",
    "our investigations lead to the criteria for the optimal usage of storage capacity and to allow to description of the basic effects as the ratio between the construction parts , steady - state performance , optimal size , etc .",
    "we want to outline that the results received and the plan of the experiment follow from the theoretical model .",
    "special consideration is given to the modification of the key formulas supposed by wolman at al .",
    "the document rate of change @xmath0 is supposed to depend on popularity index @xmath1 so the zipf - like distribution with the new exponent @xmath2 describes the effects of the renewal of web documents .",
    "the main result of any research of cache system is finding a way for increasing hit ratio . we can conclude that with growth of @xmath37 the hit rate @xmath18 increases .",
    "a general feature of the current algorithm is the only documents requested two times and more during the time @xmath12 are included in the kernel @xmath35 .",
    "it is a fact that @xmath30 less then the cache size @xmath8 , i.e. all necessary items could be stored in a cache system at the second , third and forth experimental points on the tab .  [ sr ] .",
    "therefore we can make the conclusion that a caching algorithm based on a rigid tie of the mean parameters to the time @xmath12 is ineffective .",
    "one method of resolving the current situation is reconstructing of cache systems .",
    "such a construction suggested in the sec .  [ correl ] must be implemented to provide a rigid ratio between its elements .",
    "the requests statistics must be kept even for those cacheable documents that have been deleted from the cache .",
    "this statistics should exist for long time .",
    "this is one of the key differences between our construction and the existing ones that usually operate only with the current set of documents in cache .",
    "an inseparable part of the new construction is the replacement algorithm based on zipf law .",
    "now we have prepared the corresponding application for an international patent .",
    "an additional question , which will demanded a new experimental search , is the dependence that describes the renewal of web documents .",
    "probably , the ratio @xmath38 could be considered as a universal constant .",
    "the next direction for our development plans is an investigation of a model of cache interaction in hierarchical caching system .",
