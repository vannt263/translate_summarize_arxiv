    "the discovery of superconductivity in the material mgb@xmath0 @xcite initiated intensive recent theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "the possibility of a high critical temperature in a class of materials which are chemically much simpler than the high - t@xmath4 cuprates and the occurence of large critical current densities pose some interesting new questions in the research of superconductivity .",
    "mgb@xmath0 is a type ii superconductor in the clean limit @xcite .",
    "the crystal belongs to the space group @xmath5 or @xmath6-structure where borons are packed in honeycomb layers alternating with hexagonal layers of magnesium ions .",
    "the ions mg@xmath7 are positioned above the centers of hexagons formed by boron sites and donate their electrons to the boron planes .",
    "the electronic structure is organized by the narrow energy bands with near two - fold degenerate ( @xmath1-electrons ) and the wide - band ( @xmath8-electrons ) @xcite . without any of the lattice strain",
    ", the @xmath1 dispersion relations are slightly splitted due to the two boron atoms per unit cell ( the electronic analog of davydov splitting for phonons ) .",
    "the @xmath1 portions of the fermi surface ( fs ) consist of coaxial cylinders along the @xmath9 - a symmetry direction of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , whereas the @xmath8- bands are strongly dispersive .",
    "the excited phonon modes in mgb@xmath0 present a sharp cut - off at about 100 mev .",
    "the optical modes ( @xmath10 , @xmath2 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) are practically non - dispersive , along the @xmath13 direction .",
    "various raman data @xcite show a small spread of the @xmath2 frequency around 74.5 mev in different ceramic samples of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the strong deformation potential @xmath14 of the in - plane @xmath2 mode @xcite causes a significant energy splitting of the @xmath1 band around 1.5 ev , lifting its two - fold degeneracy at the @xmath9-point of the bz . in general ,",
    "measurements of the effect of pressure on the electronic structure are based on the raman technique , therefore only the influence on the @xmath2 mode can be traced .",
    "high pressure experiments up to 15 gpa @xcite have revealed a large increase of the out of phase @xmath2 phonon mode .",
    "this leads to a suppression of the displacement of the boron atoms as well as of the deformation potential @xmath15 where _ u _ is the displacement @xcite which will be used below .",
    "moreover , experiments under pressure up to 40 gpa do not show any structural phase transition @xcite . due to",
    "the anisotropy the hydrostatic pressure decreases the inter - plane distance more than the in - plane distance between adjacent borons .",
    "the interpretation of experimental data from different spectroscopic methods @xcite , suggests the presence of two different superconducting gaps . the specific heat behavior @xcite , the low isotope effect @xcite , pressure effects @xcite and penetration depth data @xcite provide evidence for a complicated superconducting order parameter in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "recent nmr measurements @xcite of @xmath16 as well as hall measurements @xcite are consistent with a @xmath1-band driven superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 where the @xmath8 band participates due to interband scattering .",
    "the use of two order parameters is justified by recent experimental results on scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite .",
    "some microscopic theories @xcite are based on @xmath1 band or @xmath17 band scenaria for superconductivity whereas others @xcite are concentrated on a @xmath8 band superconductivity . a consensus is formed though , that the driving band for the superconductivity is the @xmath1 one .",
    "the calculated spectral functions @xcite and the analysis of the reflectance measurements @xcite show the possibility of different superconducting mechanisms beyond the conventional electron - phonon bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairing .",
    "the complicated nature of superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 does not allow at present to accept the conventional superconducting mechanism .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to construct a phenomenological theory .",
    "since mgb@xmath0 presents an example of a two - band superconductor @xcite may serve as a paradigm to investigate new effects .",
    "the purpose of this article is to present a phenomenological ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory for a two - band superconductor appropriate to mgb@xmath0 based on two order parameters and , in that framework , to provide a physical picture of pressure effects on mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the study of pressure effects is one way to investigate ( i ) the different topology of the two bands and ( ii ) the question of the participation of the two @xmath1 subbands in the superconductivity .",
    "a brief account of a part of this work was presented elsewhere @xcite . in the present article missing terms in the gl functional",
    "are restored , non - adiabatic effects are explained using a different approach and the effects of pressure are discussed in more detail and compared with very recent experiments .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the gl description is presented , in section iii the pressure effects , in connection with the @xmath1 band , are discussed and a general discussion with some concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "we introduce the gl free energy functional with two order parameters , appropriate for mgb@xmath0 , assuming that both the order parameters belong to the @xmath18 representation of the point group of mgb@xmath0 crystal .",
    "the two order parameters are labeled by the corresponding band ( @xmath1 or @xmath8 ) of mgb@xmath0 , without loss of generality :    @xmath19    2 where @xmath20 is the momentum operator , @xmath21 is the vector potential and @xmath22 .",
    "it is possible to take into account the large anisotropy of the two order parameters ( the @xmath1 is almost two - dimensional ) by rescaling of the axis according to the effective masses ( directional dependence effective mass ) . in the present work , since we are focusing exclusively on pressure effects , the derivative terms are not important .    in eq .",
    "( 1 ) we have used the fact that the mixing @xmath23-term favors the coupling of linear combination of the two order parameters with phase difference 0 if @xmath24 or @xmath8 if @xmath25 between them @xcite , therefore a term @xmath26 is incorporated into the @xmath27-term of the free energy @xcite . if @xmath28 then eq . ( 1 ) is the free energy for two bands without josephson coupling between them .",
    "the quartic @xmath27-term is the only one which mixes the two gaps and is unimportant in this case .",
    "the onset of the superconducting state in one band does not imply the onset in the other .",
    "this corresponds to the case of @xmath29 in the two - band bcs treatment @xcite . if @xmath30 , which is the case of mgb@xmath0 , then the pair transfering term is present in the gl functional and it means that the onset of superconductivity in one band implies automatically the appearance of superconductivity in the other . there is a single observed t@xmath4 which is a function of the bare ones t@xmath31 . in mgb@xmath32",
    "the compression due to pressure is anisotropic@xcite . according to ref .",
    "the compressibility along the @xmath33-axis is almost twice larger than that of the plane compressibility",
    ". therefore application of uniaxial pressure on single crystals will affect differently the two gaps . following ozaki s formulation @xcite",
    ", we may add to the gl functional , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the term which couples the order parameters , in second order , with the strain tensor @xmath34 to first order , having already specified the symmetry of the order parameters : @xmath35 |\\psi_{\\sigma}|^2 \\\\ \\nonumber & - & c_2(\\gamma_1 ) ( \\epsilon_{xx}+\\epsilon_{yy } +   \\epsilon_{zz } ) |\\psi_{\\pi}|^2 \\\\ & - & c_3(\\gamma_1 ) [ \\delta ' ( \\epsilon_{xx}+\\epsilon_{yy } ) +   \\epsilon_{zz } ] ( \\psi_{\\sigma}^ * \\psi_{\\pi } + c.c . ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are coupling constants and @xmath37 , @xmath38 are given in terms of the elastic constants of the material .",
    "this will lead to a change of the bare critical temperatures @xmath39 and consequently of the actual critical temperature @xmath40 .",
    "the physical reasoning behind this is that the material will change in such a way as to gain condensation energy by enhancing the density of states in the direction where the superconducting gap is larger .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath41 in the @xmath42 will renormalize the mixing coupling @xmath23 to @xmath43 .",
    "we model the corresponding differences by taking a linear dependence of the two bare @xmath40 s with pressure @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and we will discuss the validity of the assumption for the mgb@xmath0 later .    analyzing the equations which result from the minimization of the gl free energy we get : @xmath46 this gives the pressure dependence of the superconducting critical temperature : @xmath47    \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2 }   \\{[t_{c\\sigma}^0 - t_{c\\pi}^0 + ( \\eta_{\\pi } - \\eta_{\\sigma})p]^2 +   a^2 \\}^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 .",
    "deviations from a straight line at moderate values of pressure can be attributed to the two bands . from the above formula the inequality",
    "@xmath49 is always true as long as the renormalized mixing parameter @xmath43 is real , as a consequence of the initial assumption on the pressure dependence of the bare critical temperatures . in the case of",
    "mgb@xmath0 we can safely consider that @xmath50 .",
    "we now wish to address an issue specific to mgb@xmath0 which can be also realized in other multiband superconductors .",
    "the physical situation we would like to question is the splitting of the two @xmath1 subbands at ambient pressure and their participation in superconductivity with the increase of pressure . due to contradictory experimental as well as theoretical results",
    "we proceed by distinguishing two different scenaria .",
    "the first one addresses the splitting of the two sigma subbands at ambient pressure as shown by first princible calculations @xcite when one of the subbands is below the fermi energy @xmath51 .",
    "the second scenario addresses the opposite situation where both the @xmath1 subbands are above @xmath51 at ambient pressure .      in particular in @xcite the splitting of the two subbands was studied in detail and compared with similar situation in alb@xmath0 .",
    "the conclusion is that due to the @xmath2 phonon mode , the two @xmath1 bands split nearby @xmath9 point and the lower band completely sinks below the fermi energy .",
    "this is the case for mgb@xmath0 and also for the heavily hole - doped graphite .",
    "moreover , experimental results @xcite showed a kink in the superconducting critical temperature as a function of pressure at approximately 6 - 8 gpa and also a kink in the volume dependence of @xmath40 for mg@xmath53b@xmath0 at around 20 gpa and mg@xmath54b@xmath0 at around 15 gpa @xcite .",
    "the physics we discuss here , is the change in the electronic properties of the material under pressure and its influence on the superconducting state .",
    "the band which is below the fermi level at ambient pressure @xcite is possible to overcome the energy difference and to get above the fermi level at a certain value of pressure ( termed as crossover pressure ) , restoring the degeneracy of the two @xmath1 bands at point @xmath9 .",
    "this is a non - adiabatic effect as discussed in @xcite . to understand and illustrate this effect on the superconducting state we need to consider the pressure dependence of the coefficient @xmath55 as usual @xcite with the modification due to the particular physical situation by writing : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the heaviside step function , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are positive constants",
    "this choice reflects the fact that at a certain crossover pressure @xmath60 the second band starts to participate in superconductivity as well and that initially it is an increasing function of pressure .",
    "we obtained the above formula by requiring the continuity of the coefficient @xmath55 at @xmath60 .",
    "after the energy difference between the two @xmath1 bands almost disappears , then they both follow the same reduction of the bare @xmath40 s with pressure .",
    "the approximate value of the crossover pressure can be estimated as follows .",
    "the energy difference between the two subbands is approximated by @xmath61 , where the fraction of superconducting electrons is @xmath62 @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ the carrier density per boron atom in mg@xmath63",
    ". the approximate value of @xmath64 is half the value of the pressure which suppresses the deformation potential @xmath65 .",
    "the deformation potential in turn , can be estimated by the expression @xmath66 where @xmath67@xmath68 is a unit cell volume of mg@xmath63 and @xmath69 is the deformation potential for a boron displacement @xmath70  @xcite . using these parameters , we get a crossover pressure of @xmath71 .",
    "this estimate shows , that a realistic applied pressure influences drastically the electronic structure and the fs topology , restoring the degeneracy of the two subbands at the @xmath9-point which are initially splitted .",
    "superconductivity in the second subband may occur at lower values of the estimated @xmath60 due to the fact that both subbands are affected .",
    "the elimination of the energy difference around the fermi energy will also occur at lower values due to the corrugation of the @xmath1 portions of the fs , the already existing strains in the material and the anisotropic compressibility .",
    "these considerations make the above estimate an upper limit of the crossover pressure @xmath60 . the degree to which shear stresses of the sample and",
    "the surrounding fluid under pressure affect the data of pressure measurements is still under investigation @xcite .",
    "the microscopic nature of this crossover is caused by the change of the fs . if the topology of the fs changes under pressure ( this subsection ) or due to substitutions in the composition ( next subsection ) , a van hove singularity at critical energy @xmath72 in the electronic density of states @xmath73 is manifested in an electronic topological transition of the 5/2 kind @xcite .",
    "since @xmath74 is essentially proportional to the derivative @xmath75 , it develops singularities @xmath76 , provided that the strength of carrier attraction varies slightly with pressure @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 using a model calculation , we illustrate the expected behavior of @xmath40 and the form of the order parameter as a function of pressure at fixed temperature and , schematically , the kink of @xmath40 at @xmath60 due to the change of the slope from eq .",
    "the predicted kink close to @xmath60 can be detected directly in a penetration depth experiment under pressure .",
    "the chosen parameters are such that they respect the relation @xmath77 , the fact that the superconducting density coming from the @xmath1 band is higher than the one coming from the @xmath8 band ( @xmath78 ) and that the driving band for superconductivity is @xmath1 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the contribution on the gr@xmath3neisen parameter : @xmath80    where b is the bulk modulus and @xmath81 is the phonon frequency , can be approximately obtained if we observe that @xmath82 then @xmath83 .",
    "the bulk modulus is measured to be b@xmath84 gpa @xcite and our estimate for the gr@xmath3neisen parameter is g@xmath85 3.8 . experimentally g@xmath86 as reported in @xcite for the measured raman active e@xmath87 phonon mode . however , as indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , for anisotropic crystals it would be more appropriate to scale the frequency shift in the gr@xmath3neisen parameter with the variation of the lattice constant @xmath88 such as @xmath89 @xcite . then , the gr@xmath3neisen parameter for the mgb@xmath0 takes the value 3.9 @xmath90 0.4 .",
    "there is an excellent agreement with the above estimate and it justifies our approach .",
    "some recent experimental and theoretical studies @xcite lend support to a second scenario .",
    "more specifically , the substitution of mg by the higher valent al was used to provide the necessary change of the fermi energy via electron concentration and the lattice parameters in the compound mg@xmath91al@xmath92b@xmath0 .",
    "this is in essence equivalent to a change of fermi surface topology as in the pressure experiments . as it was shown in @xcite by increasing the al content ( equivalently by increasing the pressure ) , a topological crossover occurs at some point and the negative slope of @xmath40 as a function of al content @xmath93 decreases further giving a different picture from that of fig . 1 .    to model this in the language of the gl model",
    ", one basically has to substitute the pressure p and the crossover pressure @xmath60 with the al concentration @xmath93 and and the crossover concentration @xmath94 respectively , requiring again continuity at @xmath94 : @xmath95    where the extra substrcipt @xmath93 denotes that the numerical coefficients are different from eq .",
    "the critical temperature as a function of the al content is illustrated in fig .",
    "the physics is similar to the topological transition described in scenario i where now instead of pressure , the changing parameter is the composition .",
    "it is a more controlled way to change the topology of the fs .",
    "in fact , an abrupt topological change in the @xmath1-band fermi surface was found at @xmath96 in ref .",
    "@xcite . when the @xmath1 bands are filled in mg@xmath91al@xmath92b@xmath0 at @xmath97 , superconductivity dissapears .",
    "it is worth noticing that in this compound , the impurity scattering broadens the van hove singularities at the saddle points e@xmath4 of the fs and smears the change of slope of @xmath40 at e@xmath4 .",
    "therefore the kink of @xmath40 in fig . 2 will be less pronounced ( see also the experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize here the need of de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) data for mg@xmath91al@xmath92b@xmath0 , especially close to x=0.3 .",
    "the pressure derivative of the superconducting critical temperature as a function of the concentration @xmath98 can be also conclusive since it can clarify the correlation between pressure , al concentration and the kink at @xmath94 .",
    "interestingly enough , there is an obvious discrepancy from the two pictures of the previous section , which calls for more experimental data .",
    "observation of quantum oscillations in dhva experiments provides the information about the bands , the effective mass of the carriers and the shape of the fermi surface in mgb@xmath0 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath99 the smaller cylindrical fermi surface along the c - axis was observed ( with a hole band mass -0.251 m@xmath100 , where m@xmath100 is the electron mass ) .",
    "the same authors reported the observation of @xmath99 the larger of the two @xmath1 tube - like fermi surfaces ( with a band mass -0.553 m@xmath100 ) in ref .",
    "although the estimated parameters of the mgb@xmath0 are in agreement with the lda band calculations @xcite future dhva experiments should clarify the detailed observation of the @xmath1 portions of the fs . also note that angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments @xcite detected @xmath101 band along the @xmath102 symmetry line of the bz",
    "there are a few points in order to discuss further with respect to applicability of the theory developed here .",
    "early pressure experiments @xcite demonstrated the overall decrease of @xmath40 with a pressure increase which was attributed to the loss of holes . in two of the samples of @xcite",
    "there is a linear dependence of @xmath40 on pressure and in two others a weak quadratic dependence .",
    "we stress that the samples were polycrystalline and the experiment is effectively under hydrostatic pressure .",
    "also the degree of nonstoichiometry was not known .",
    "the almost linear dependence for a wide range of pressures , makes the gl functional as presented , valid for mgb@xmath0 .",
    "experiments on single crystals will be able to clarify the effects which are described .",
    "we do not attempt at the moment any actual detailed fitting of experimental data , except from the illustrative fitting in section iii , because there is no experimental consensus on the different values of key parameters of the theory ( _ e.g. _ , there is a wide range of published data on the value of @xmath74 @xcite ) .",
    "more detailed raman data with optical reflectivity , specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements under pressure in the superconducting phase are needed as well as a penetration depth experiment which can reveal the pressure dependence of the superfluid density .",
    "also the experiments suggested in scenaria i and ii will be crucial in the question regarding the topological transition , where @xmath51 can be varied experimentally either by external pressure ( sec .",
    "iiia ) or by alloying ( sec.iiib ) .",
    "recent raman spectra at high pressure @xcite reveal a reduction of the slope of the pressure - induced frequency shift by about a factor of two , at about 18 gpa which supports the suggestion that mgb@xmath0 may undergo a pressure - induced topological electronic transition . in connection with the appearance of superconductivity under pressure",
    ", we stress the high pressure superconducting phase of casi@xmath0 which superconducts above an applied pressure of 12 gpa with @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "one proposed experiment which can potentially show the different role of the two bands ( @xmath1 and @xmath8 ) is the detection of the leggett mode or the internal josephson current @xcite .",
    "moreover an upward curvature in h@xmath104 is also known to be a signature of multicomponent superconductivity .",
    "in summary , we present an analysis of pressure effects , within the gl theory , of a two - band superconductor and apply it to mgb@xmath0 .",
    "we make predictions for non - adiabatic effects and discuss different experiments from which crucial information can be extracted on the physics of the two participating bands @xmath1 and @xmath8 as well as the more delicate questions on the two @xmath1 subbands .",
