    "studies of hydrogen absorption in the lines of sight towards distant quasars have served to both define , and in recent years bring precision to , our cosmological models . the low density , highly ionized  lines ( a.k.a .",
    "the intergalactic medium , igm ) , with column densities @xmath24 , have through their aggregate statistical properties ( e.g.  their flux power spectrum , mean flux , and column density distributions ) constrained cosmological parameters such as the primordial power spectrum and the baryonic mass density and astrophysical parameters like the amplitude of the ionizing background ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the majority of  lines and the dlas have , through analysis of their  lines , precisely measured  values that permit detailed study of their physical properties ( e.g.  metallicity ) . for systems with intermediate  values ( @xmath26 ) , however ,  and most of the lyman series lines lie on the flat portion of the curve - of - growth making the  value difficult to constrain . on the other hand ,",
    "these systems are optically thick to ionizing radiation and impose a readily identified signature in a quasar spectrum at the lyman limit . these so - called lyman limit systems ( llss ) ,",
    "currently the least - well studied of absorption systems at high redshift , are the focus of this manuscript .    historically , the llss were among the first class of quasar absorption line ( qal ) systems to be surveyed @xcite .",
    "this is because their spectral signature is obvious in low - resolution , low s / n spectra .",
    "the principal challenge is that the lyman limit occurs redward of the atmospheric cutoff only for systems with redshifts @xmath27 . for lower redshifts ,",
    "one requires spectrometers on space - borne ultraviolet satellites . by the mid 1990 s ,",
    "samples of several tens of llss were generated spanning redshifts @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "these results were derived from heterogeneous sets of quasars discovered from a combination of color - selection , radio detection , and slitless spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the spectra , too , were acquired with a diverse set of instrumentation and therefore varying s / n and spectral resolution mitigating differing sensitivity to the precise optical depth at the lyman limit . although the results were not fully consistent with one another , the general picture that resulted was a rapidly evolving population of absorption systems reasonably described by a @xmath29 power - law .",
    "cosmologically , the llss contribute much if not most of the universe s opacity to ionizing radiation . and",
    ", until recently , the observed incidence of the lls provided the only direct means of estimating the mean free path  at any redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a companion paper ( * ? ? ? * ; hereafter pwo09 ) , we have presented a new technique to measure  that circumvents any knowledge of the llss .",
    "a more precise census of the llss will serve as a consistency check for this  calculation , but is unlikely to ever again be a competitive approach . instead , the incidence of lls can be used in combination with estimates of  to assess the  frequency distribution for gas with @xmath30 , a regime that is very difficult to explore by studying individual absorption systems .",
    "surveys of the llss are also likely to place tight constraints on @xmath31 cosmological simulations that include radiative transfer .    physically , the nature of systems that give rise to a lls remains an open question .",
    "the systems with the largest  values ( i.e.  @xmath32 , the so - called the super - lls or slls and dlas ) are likely associated with the interstellar medium and outer regions of high @xmath33 galaxies . these high  systems , however , are only a subset of the lls population .",
    "unfortunately , a proper modeling of the llss almost certainly requires careful modeling of radiative transfer in cosmological simulations which has thus far been beyond the scope of modern computations in cosmological simulations .",
    "indeed , the few studies to date have tended to severely underestimate the incidence of lls ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see kohler & gnedin 2007 ) . in recent simulations of high @xmath33 galaxy formation , however , theorists have placed great attention on ` streams ' of cold gas that carry fresh material from the igm to star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "these cold streams have relatively large hydrogen surface densities ( @xmath34 ) and could therefore produce lyman limit absorption provided the material has a non - negligible neutral fraction . consequently , an accurate census of the llss with redshift may directly constrain the nature and prevalence of cold streams in the young universe .    a final , yet perhaps most important , motivation for studying the llss is that these systems may dominate the census of metals at all epochs .",
    "the majority of llss are metal - bearing , showing metal - line transitions of common low and high - ions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because the estimated ionization corrections for llss with @xmath17 is large , observations of ions in an lls likely track only a trace amount of the metals actually present in the gas .",
    "lyman limit systems may show a wider spread in their ionization and metal content relative to the igm or dla , further emphasizing the need for a robust lls survey .    in this paper , we survey the homogeneous dataset of quasar spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , using all 7 public data releases .",
    "our observational analysis aims to produce the most precise measurement of the lls incidence paying careful attention to systematic biases .",

    "in a few cases , we will distinguish between these ` strong ' llss from those with lower , referring to the latter as @xmath55 lls .",
    "we also note that our @xmath0 definition for a lls differs from other works which adopted @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",

    "observationally , the absorption of a background source by a @xmath0 lls is readily apparent , even in low s / n spectra .",
    "we define absorbers with @xmath58 ( i.e.  @xmath59 ) as the partial lyman limit systems ( pllss ) .",
    "to survey these systems , one requires higher quality spectra or an alternate approach to the analysis .",
    "we define the redshift of an lls as    @xmath60    where @xmath61 marks the observed onset of ll absorption . in practice , this is is often estimated from strong lyman series lines ( e.g.  , ) that accompany the lyman limit opacity .",
    "we define the sub - set of llss that occur within 3000of the emission redshift of the background source as proximate llss ( pllss ) .",
    "we separate the analysis of these systems from the rest to investigate changes in the incidence of optically thick gas near high @xmath33 quasars due to , e.g.  the quasar s radiation field and local environment .",
    "finally , we define the observable  as the average number of @xmath0 lls detected per unit redshift at a given redshift . in the previous literature , this quantity is also expressed as @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . for comparison with previous results in the literature ,",
    "we also consider , the number of @xmath56 llss detected per unit redshift .",
    "we also attempt to separate the contributions to  from sllsa , dlas , and attribute the remainder to the llss with @xmath65 , .",
    "one of the primary objectives of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) was to discover @xmath66 new quasars across the northern sky @xcite .",
    "the strategy of the sdss team to achieve this ambitious goal was a four - fold process : ( i ) obtain deep , multi - band images across a large area of the sky ; ( ii ) select quasar candidates by demanding a point - like , point - spread - function and imposing color criteria that separate the candidates from the galactic stellar locus ; ( iii ) obtain follow - up spectra for a magnitude - limited sample with a fiber - fed spectrograph .",
    "the details of target selection and quasar completeness with redshift is described at length in a series of sdss papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but see @xcite for a new and more accurate analysis ; and ( iv ) automatically identify quasars and estimate their redshifts ( ) through template fitting to the optical spectroscopy .    of these steps , the second has the greatest impact on a survey for high @xmath33 lyman limit systems .",
    "the key issue for our survey is whether the presence of an intervening lls biases the targeting of the background quasar for follow - up spectroscopy . in effect , a high @xmath33 lls severely ` reddens ' the quasar at the bluest optical wavelengths of the sdss imaging . with this effect in mind ,",
    "the sdss team imposed cuts on the @xmath67 color which better separated the quasar locus in color pace from the stellar locus .",
    "the net effect , however , is to bias the spectroscopic follow - up against quasar sightlines _ without _ a foreground lls ( pwo09 ) .",
    "our analysis indicates an important bias for quasars with @xmath68 .",
    "for this reason , we limit the statistical analysis to quasars with @xmath69 , but we also explore the bias by considering the incidence of llss toward quasars with @xmath70 .    the quasar spectra analyzed in this paper were taken from the sloan digital sky survey , data release 7 @xcite .",
    "we retrieved the ` best ' 1d spectrum for every source flagged as a qso or hiz_qso .",
    "this totaled 102,418 unique spectra .",
    "the sdss survey employs a fiber - fed , dual - camera spectrometer that provides continuous wavelength coverage from @xmath71  at a spectral resolution of fwhm  @xmath72 .",
    "the sdss team employs a custom , data - reduction pipeline that performs sky subtraction using empirical measurements from fibers placed to avoid objects detected in the sdss images .",
    "the majority of data suffer from excessive sky noise at long wavelengths ( @xmath73 ) and the instrument throughput and atmospheric absorption limits the sensitivity at the shortest wavelengths ( @xmath74 ) .    .",
    ", width=336 ]    a survey for lyman limit absorption in quasar spectra involves two principle steps .",
    "first , one must assess the flux at wavelengths near the lyman limit in the quasar s rest - frame , @xmath75 .",
    "we discuss our procedure for this step in the following section .",
    "the second step is to estimate the flux at wavelengths blueward of lls candidates .",
    "there are several characteristics of the sdss spectroscopy which negatively affect this estimate .",
    "a generic concern is the poorer instrument response at the bluest wavelengths . at the bluest wavelengths , many of the spectra exhibit a very low signal - to - noise ratio and yield flux estimates consistent with zero , even without an intervening lls .",
    "therefore , we have limited our survey to redshifts @xmath3 corresponding to @xmath76 . in practice , we restrict the quasar sample to objects with @xmath69 and perform a search for llss at all redshifts , but then only analyze absorption systems with @xmath3 .",
    "we also limit the survey to quasars with @xmath77 because the sdss spectra of higher redshift objects are generally too low s / n to permit a robust analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : snz]a presents histograms of the emission redshifts for the statistical sample and the signal - to - noise of the absorbed continuum at the lyman limit (; see below for the definition ) .",
    "another difficulty with the sdss spectra at blue wavelengths is that the two - dimensional spectra of faint sources may be improperly traced . on occasion ,",
    "the 1d extractions include flux from a neighboring object and yield a systematic overestimate of the flux .",
    "this effect reduces the estimated opacity for a lls .",
    "another issue , especially with a fiber - fed spectrometer , is that the sky model is estimated from nearby fibers that are intentionally placed on ` object - free ' regions of the sky .",
    "although the sdss project has worked carefully to mitigate the effects of variable fiber efficiency , significant misestimates of the sky are known to occur .",
    "we have identified tens of objects where the extracted flux is significantly negative , indicating an overestimate in the sky model .",
    "this may convert a partial lls ( with @xmath78 ) into a @xmath0 lls . by a similar token",
    ", a proper @xmath0 lls may appear as a plls if the sky is underestimated .",
    "we proceed under the expectation that this effect is nearly random , i.e.  for every underestimate of the sky there is a corresponding overestimate , but this has not been rigorously established .",
    "the sdss fibers are sufficiently wide ( diameter of @xmath79 ) that they will occasionally include flux from a projected neighbor",
    ". these coincident objects may be much fainter than the quasar at redder wavelengths , but they could contribute all of the flux blueward of a strong lls and lead to an underestimate of the ll opacity fiber could dominate the flux at the bluest wavelengths , although this should generally be mitigated by the fact that the sdss team acquires 3 unique exposures per target . ] .",
    "absent any other sources of opacity , one can trivially estimate  from the quasar spectrum through measurements of the flux both redward and blueward of the observed lyman limit ( equation  [ eqn : flux ] ) . in practice , however , the quasar flux is also attenuated by line opacity from the so - called  forest ( a.k.a . , the intergalactic medium ; igm ) . for example , consider a lyman limit system at @xmath80 intervening a @xmath81 quasar .",
    "the lls attenuates the quasar flux blueward of @xmath82 . at this wavelength ,",
    "the quasar spectrum recorded on earth will also include opacity from the  forest at @xmath83 ,  absorption from the igm at @xmath84 , etc .",
    "it is necessary , therefore , to account for these additional sources of opacity when estimating .",
    "we can express the observed ( rest - frame ) quasar flux @xmath85 in terms of the intrinsic flux ( just ) redward of the lyman limit @xmath86 as    @xmath87 \\cmma\\ ] ]    where  is the effective opacity of the igm from lyman series line - opacity .",
    "the lls introduces an additional , continuous opacity blueward of the lyman limit :    @xmath88 \\perd\\ ] ]    a precise estimate of @xmath89 , therefore , requires an estimation of the absorbed quasar flux not its intrinsic flux . conveniently , this quantity is the observed flux recorded in the spectrum at @xmath90 .",
    "there are still significant challenges because the igm opacity is stochastic on both small ( individual lyman lines ) and modest scales ( many 10 ) and the intrinsic quasar spectrum ( both shape and normalization ) varies from source to source .",
    "we now describe an automated procedure used to estimate the absorbed continuum from each quasar spectrum .     and @xmath91 .",
    "the spectra have been offset by a factor of 1.5 for presentation purposes and the normalization is not physically meaningful .",
    "the increasing impact of the  forest is readily apparent at wavelengths @xmath92 . at @xmath93",
    ", we have set the template to a constant value .",
    ", height=336 ]    the traditional method of estimating the quasar continuum is to first identify regions of unabsorbed quasar flux and then to interpolate a continuum level between these regions . for quasars at high redshift",
    ", this method is particularly error prone , because at wavelengths below  emission we expect few ( and at very high redshift , none ) of the pixels to be free of absorption from the igm .",
    "moreover , this traditional method frequently requires by - hand modification , which is time - intensive and subjective to individual biases .",
    "methods do exist to automatically generate a quasar continuum from emission - line characteristics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these are designed to infer the intrinsic quasar spectrum not the igm - absorbed continuum .",

    "a @xmath0 lls has an apparent flux at @xmath222 and therefore was modeled as a plls .",
    "this is the dominant effect of a sky subtraction bias . although our mock spectra had even numbers of over and under - subtracted sky backgrounds , only the former are relatively easy to identify ( large regions of spectra are significantly negative ) and ignore .",

    "our tests with mock spectra and follow - up observations with keck / lris ( appendix  [ appx : keck ] ) indicated that we could robustly identify @xmath0 lls in such data .",
    "we also noted , however , that many of the spectra showed plls candidates which reduced the  to below 1 and made the search for @xmath0 lls much more challenging .",
    "our response was to redefine the search path by attenuating the absorbed continuum due to any identified plls candidates and then reapply the  criterion for the remaining @xmath224 spectral range .",
    "with this approach , the search path was frequently terminated by the presence of a plls candidate .    in principle , this modification should provide an unbiased search for @xmath0 lls .",
    "our trials with mock spectra , however , revealed an insidious bias associated with this redefinition of the search path .",

    "furthermore , we find that it is very difficult to precisely estimate the magnitude of this systematic bias for it depends sensitively on , the incidence of plls , and the quasar  distribution . in our opinion",
    ", one can not robustly correct for this systematic plls bias and we caution against performing any analysis that would be subject to it . for these reasons , we _ ignore _ plls when defining the survey path based on a signal to noise criterion and performing the search for @xmath0 lls . with this approach",
    ", one must have sufficient  to identify lls even when one or more plls modify the absorbed continuum .",
    "this last point motivated our decision to restrict the survey to spectra with  @xmath217 .",
    "as noted in the previous sub - section , lls and plls that lie close to one another in redshift are very difficult to distinguish as individual systems .",
    "this is even true in the limit where one has spectra with exquisite s / n and resolution when @xmath136 ( or less in the case of high resolution echelle observations ) .",
    "with sdss spectra , the limited information provided by the lyman limit and the strongest lyman series lines is insufficient to robustly distinguish multiple llss from a single system .",
    "this leads to a `` blending bias '' that manifests itself in several ways .",
    "first , the blending bias increases the number of llss observed because pairs of pllss blend together to give a single system with @xmath0 .",
    "second , the absorption redshifts of the llss are shifted to higher redshifts because one generally adopts  from the higher of the pair of systems .",
    "this leads to a smaller survey path and possibly a higher inferred incidence of llss . more importantly ( see below ) , many llss are shifted into the proximate region of the quasar .",
    "this causes an underestimate of for intervening llss and an overestimate of pllss .",
    "we explored the quantitative effects of the blending bias with the following analysis .",
