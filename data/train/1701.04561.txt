    "the meson @xmath0 ( and its anti - particle @xmath8 ) , as unique explicitly doubly heavy - flavored meson at ground state in the standard model ( sm ) , has attracted a lot of interests since it was first observed by cdf collaboration@xcite . due to its doubly heavy flavored nature",
    ", the two heavy components inside it move non - relativistically and it can be described reliably by potential model@xcite , while its production may be described in terms of the effective theory of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd)@xcite and its decays may be described by effective theory of weak interaction which is based on sm .    since the fact that the discovery and the available observations are at high energy colliders , so the theoretical and experimental studies on @xmath0 meson so far mainly have been concentrated on hadronic colliders with high luminosty@xcite .",
    "however , at a hadronic collider , the production of @xmath0 meson is through collisions of partons inside the colliding hadrons , the longitudinal component of the momentum of the products and the center - of - mass system of the reaction as well can not be determined , so only the perpendicular components of the momentum of the products can be measured and can be used for tests .",
    "moreover , in hadronic colliders , there are always many hadrons in final state which relate to the initial hadrons but not relate to the subprocess of @xmath0 meson production at all , and cause backgrounds only . on the contrary , there are less backgrounds at an @xmath3 collider , and the center - of - mass system of initial @xmath3 is well - controlled , so the momentum components of products as well as angle distribution of the concerned product can be used to test theoretical prediction , thus to study @xmath0 meson production at an @xmath3 collider is interesting . based on the theoretical estimate and lep - i experimental observation , the @xmath0 meson production is small even running at the resonance of @xmath2-boson@xcite .",
    "however , now several plans about @xmath2-factories ( @xmath3 colliders running at energies around @xmath2 pole with much higher luminosity than that of lep - i ) , e.g. ilc , cepc and fcc - ee , are under considering , thus we think that it is the time now to re - study the production of @xmath0 by @xmath3 collisions . as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the production of @xmath0 by @xmath3 collisions , even at the energy of @xmath2-pole through the @xmath2-boson resonance , contains much more information than that the production from @xmath2 decay , thus in ref.@xcite we re - considered the production thoroughly , and now we consider its qcd corrections up - to the next order , although in the literature the production through @xmath2-decay up - to the next order qcd corrections is considered in refs.@xcite .",
    "indeed , the calculation on the production for the @xmath3 collisions up - to the next order qcd corrections is more complicated than that for the production via @xmath2 decay .",
    "according to nrqcd , the production of @xmath0 meson in an electron - positron collider can be factorized into two parts : one is the production of free @xmath9 quark pair inclusively in short distance which can be calculated by pertubative qcd ( pqcd ) , and the other one is that to form the meson @xmath0 from the produced @xmath9 quark pair . the later is of nonperturbative nature , but can be determined phenomenologically or potential model etc .",
    "whereas here we take into account the qcd corrections up - to next order on the former part and the later part ( the factors ) is kept only at the leading order in relative velocity @xmath10 between the two heavy quarks inside the meson @xmath0 .    to study the production of such a doubly heavy system ( @xmath0 meson )",
    "can help to understand the perturbative and nonperturbative qcd deeper .",
    "since @xmath0 carries two heavy - flavors explicitly , its excited states will decay to @xmath0 through strong or electromagnetic interaction with almost @xmath11 probability , thus , here we also study the production of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 , the lowest excited state of @xmath0 ) so as to understand some of the excited state production .",
    "the study of the production and decay of these excited states is also interesting .",
    "as mentioned above , recently in ref.@xcite we have studied the production of doubly heavy flavored hadrons ( @xmath0 meson and baryons @xmath14 etc and their excited states as well as their antiparticle ) at @xmath3 colliders .",
    "it is found that if one wishes to study @xmath0 meson ( and its excited states ) thoroughly , then the @xmath3 collider should run at the @xmath2 pole with a very luminosity , such as @xmath15 even higher . in ref.@xcite",
    "we studied the total cross section as well as the differential cross sections relating to outgoing angles and energy of the produced @xmath0 meson ( and its excited states ) under complete qcd approach to leading order ( lo ) and fragmentation approach to leading logarithm order ( ll ) .",
    "the lo results have remarkable dependence on the renormalization scale .",
    "these make the lo results bring in considerable uncertainty . in order to give a more precise theoretical prediction and to see the dependence on the renormalization scale , in this paper , we calculate the @xmath0 ( and @xmath1 ) meson production at an @xmath3 collider , which runs near the @xmath2 pole , up - to the nlo corrections of qcd under the complete qcd approach .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : following the introduction , in section ii , we present the brief formulas on which the lo calculations are based . in section iii",
    ", we present the approaches to compute the nlo corrections of qcd for the @xmath0 ( and @xmath1 ) meson production at @xmath3 colliders . in section iv",
    ", we present the numerical results .",
    "section v is reserved for discussions and summary .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    there are four feynman diagrams for the @xmath0(@xmath1 ) meson production at lo , two of them have been shown in fig.[feylo ] , the other two can be obtained by interchanging the @xmath16quark and @xmath17quark lines in fig.[feylo ] . when the collider runs around the @xmath2 pole , to compare with the contributions from @xmath2 exchange , those from @xmath18 exchange are tiny , so in our calculations here the contributions up - to nlo qcd corrections from the @xmath18 exchange are ignored , although at the end of section v , the contributions from the @xmath18 exchange at lo level are presented and discussed .    the cross section up - to lo qcd can be formulated as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the flux factor .",
    "@xmath21 means that the spins and the colors in the initial and final states are sumed over .",
    "1/4 comes from the spin average of initial @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the three - body phase space for the final states .",
    "@xmath23 is the lo feynman amplitude , which is the sum of four terms relating to the lo feynman digrams .",
    "the details about @xmath23 can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections to the process @xmath24 include virtual and real corrections .",
    "half of the feynman diagrams for virtual correction can be found in figs.[feyct],[feyself],[feytri],[feybox ] , and half of the feynman diagrams for real correction can be found in fig.[feyreal ] .",
    "the other half of the feynman diagrams for virtual and real corrections can be easily obtained by interchanging the @xmath25-quark and @xmath26-quark lines in figs.[feyct]@xmath27[feyreal ] . to the nlo qcd accuracy ,",
    "the cross section is formulated as @xmath28 here @xmath29 denotes the so - called virtual correction and @xmath30 denotes the so - called real correction .",
    "now let us calculate them respectively .",
    ".,scaledwidth=80.0% ]                      the virtual correction up - to nlo of qcd is the contributions from the interference of the lo ones with the correction feynman diagrams , i.e. figs.[feyct],[feyself],[feytri],[feybox ] and those of these diagrams with the @xmath26-quark and @xmath25-quark lines being interchanged .",
    "thus the correction to the cross section can be formulated as @xmath31    there are ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergences in the amplitudes relating to the correction diagrams .",
    "we adopt dimensional regularization with @xmath32 to isolate the uv and ir divergences .",
    "there are the coulomb divergences in the conventional matching procedure , which should be absorbed into the binding potential for the two heavy quarks inside the meson @xmath0 . in the dimensional regularization",
    ", there is a simpler way to extract the nrqcd short - distance coefficients directly using the method of regions@xcite , i.e. , expanding the amplitudes with the relative momentum ( @xmath33 ) of the constituent quarks before performing loop integration , and in the lowest non - relativistic approximation for the @xmath34-wave states of the binding system @xmath9 , only the terms with @xmath35 are taken .",
    "thus we do nt confront the contributions from the low energy regions such as those from the potential region .    in dimensional regularization , @xmath36 should be treated carefully .",
    "we adopt the reading point prescription@xcite .",
    "it has the following rules ,    * the anticommutation relation @xmath37 is valid .",
    "thus after applying the anticommutation relation and @xmath38 , there is one or no @xmath36 in each dirac trace .",
    "* cyclic manipulation in the dirac traces is prevented .",
    "when considering the contributions from several diagrams , for all of them the traces in the amplitude ( or resulting from squared fermionic amplitudes ) must be read with starting from the same vertex respectively . * the relevant axial current anomalies would be obtained and the conservation for vector currents is guaranteed by starting all the traces with the axial vector vertex .    here",
    "the uv divergences come from self - energy , vertex and triangle diagrams only , is canceled by the uv divergence from the other anomalous diagram . ] which are canceled by the counter terms through renormalization , and here the renormalization scheme is that the renormalization constants @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , which correspond to the renormalization of quark field , quark mass and gluon field , are determined by the renormalization of the on - mass - shell scheme ( os ) , whereas @xmath42 relating to the strong coupling constant @xmath43 is determined by the renormalization of the modified - minimal - subtraction scheme ( @xmath44 ) . then with the renormalization , we have : @xmath45 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\delta z^{os}_m&=&-3~c_f \\frac{\\alpha_s}{4\\pi}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{uv}}- \\gamma_e+   { \\rm ln}\\frac{4\\pi \\mu^2}{m^2}+\\frac{4}{3}\\right],\\nonumber\\\\   \\delta z^{os}_3&=&\\frac{\\alpha_s}{4\\pi}\\left[(\\beta'_0 - 2c_a)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{uv}}-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{ir}}\\right ) \\right . \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\left.-\\frac{4}{3}t_f \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{uv}}-\\gamma_e + { \\rm ln}\\frac{4\\pi \\mu^2}{m_c^2}\\right)\\right . \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\left.-\\frac{4}{3}t_f \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{uv}}-\\gamma_e + { \\rm ln}\\frac{4\\pi \\mu^2}{m_b^2}\\right)\\right ] , \\nonumber\\\\   \\delta z^{\\overline{ms}}_g&=&- \\frac{\\beta_0}{2}\\frac{\\alpha_s}{4\\pi}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{uv}}- \\gamma_e+ { \\rm ln}~(4\\pi ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 appearing in @xmath47 and @xmath48 represents the mass @xmath49 or @xmath50 accordingly , @xmath4 is the energy where the renormalization is to carry out , and @xmath51 is euler s constant .",
    "@xmath52 is the one - loop coefficient of the qcd @xmath53-function , and @xmath54 is the number of active quark flavors . here for the concerned process , there are three light quarks @xmath55 and two heavy quarks @xmath56 , so @xmath57 .",
    "but in eq.([rencont ] ) precisely @xmath58 , and @xmath59 for the light quark flavors . for @xmath60 group , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "because there is no external gluon line at lo level , @xmath64 is canceled at nlo total amplitude level , so the final results are independent of the renormalization scheme of the gluon field .    according to refs.@xcite",
    ", the ir divergences in the feynman diagrams for the virtual corrections can be well analyzed .",
    "for the concerned process , the ir divergences come from the vertex , box and pentagon diagrams . of fig.[feytri ] , only the amplitudes corresponding to diagrams vertex-5 and vertex-6 have ir divergences . of fig.[feybox ] , except box-4 , the rests have ir divergences production through z - decay in refs.@xcite . ] . the other half of the feynman diagrams , which are obtained from figs.[feytri]@xmath27[feybox ] by interchanging the @xmath26-quark and @xmath25-quark lines , have similar ir divergences .",
    "the ir divergences in the virtual correction will be canceled by the ir divergences from counter terms and real corrections .",
    "note that here ` the nlo real correction ' for the concerned process @xmath65 means to take into account the full contributions from the process @xmath66 with the gluon in final state covering whole possible phase space with the gluon @xmath67 so soft being emerged by @xmath25 or @xmath68 . ] .",
    "half of the feynman diagrams for the real correction are shown in fig.[feyreal ] and the other half can be obtained from fig.[feyreal ] through interchanging the @xmath26-quark and @xmath25-quark lines .",
    "the correction to the relevant cross section can be written as : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the sum of 24 terms relating to the 24 feynman diagrams for the real correction .",
    "@xmath71 can be formulated as @xmath72 where @xmath73 vary from 1 to 24 corresponding to the 24 real correction feynman diagrams .",
    "there are ir divergences in the real correction , which are generated by phase space integration , and they should be finally canceled by the ir divergences appearing in the virtual correction . it is easy to realize@xcite that , the terms @xmath74 are ir finite for the phase space integral unless @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the amplitudes corresponding to feynman diagrams in which a real gluon is emitted from an external on - shell line , e.g. , here the first 8 diagrams in fig.[feyreal ] . at this step ,",
    "let us divide the cross section of the real correction into two parts as @xmath77 where @xmath78 contains the terms in @xmath79 only when @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the amplitudes corresponding to feynman diagrams in which a real gluon is emitted from an external on - shell line .",
    "namely we can formulate @xmath78 as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the sum of the amplitudes corresponding to feynman diagrams in which a real gluon is emitted from an external on - shell line .",
    "@xmath82 contains the remaining terms in @xmath79 , i.e. , @xmath83 . due to the fact that there is no divergence in @xmath84 ,",
    "we can calculated it in 4-dimensional space - time directly .    in order to extract the ir divergences in @xmath85 precisely so as to cancel the ir divergences in virtual correction precisely , we adopt the two - cutoff phase space slicing method@xcite . by this method ,",
    "the integration on the phase space is divided into two sectors through introducing a very soft cut @xmath86 on the energy of the emitting gluon ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "then , @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90    to calculate @xmath91 , the eikonal approximation is adopted to deal with the amplitudes involved in @xmath81 , where the terms of @xmath92 in @xmath91 have been neglected @xcite . under this approximation , the amplitude corresponding to the feynman diagram where a real gluon emitted from an external line can be factorized as a born factor multiplying an eikonal factor , and it is easy to check that the eikonal factors relating to the diagrams real-5 and real-6 of fig.[feyreal ] are canceled by the eikonal factors relating to the diagrams real-7 and real-8 of fig.[feyreal ] respectively at the leading order approximation in relative velocity @xmath93 .",
