    "convective flows are driven in stars by the thermal buoyancy , which results from unstable density stratifications .",
    "both observations and numerical simulations show that convective motions are characterized by deterministic structures of different scales such as unsteady convective rolls and semi - regular convective cells created by large - scale instabilities of the buoyancy , along with the fully developed turbulence due to extremely high reynolds numbers in the stellar convection zones .",
    "the bulk of a convection zone is stochastically filled up with numerous unsteady convective rolls pushing each other and leaving little space in between @xcite .",
    "close to the boundaries of the convective region , semi - regular convective cells jostle onto the surface and roughly line up seen for examples as the rayleigh - bnard convection @xcite and the solar granulation @xcite .",
    "such semi - deterministic and well - organized structures have already been recognized to have fundamental significance on the overall properties of the convection . from the dynamical point of view",
    ", the buoyancy drives the fluids continuously moving up and down alternatively in the convective rolling cells by doing the mechanical works respectively on the corresponding flows .",
    "due to the equation of mass conservation , the flows form a cellular pattern with the warm fluids moving up in the center and the cold fluids moving down along the borders .",
    "such a cellular motion creates shears of the velocities between the neighbouring layers in the convective rolling cells , which contributes to the generation of turbulence . from the thermodynamic point of view",
    ", the cellular motion introduces inhomogeneous temperature perturbations over the stationary temperature background in the convective rolling cells , which results in extra fluxes transferring heat into or out of the boundaries of the convective cells .",
    "therefore , each of the convective rolling cells runs as an individual heat engine , within which fluids absorbing heat at the higher temperature boundary while releasing heat at the lower temperature boundary , and the convective cell operates cycle by cycle to transform heat into the mechanical work , which is the energy supply of the cellular motions themselves in the convective rolling cells .",
    "thermal convection is an essential input physics for the stellar modelling .",
    "it not only carries heat outward from the stellar interior , but mixes different materials completely in the convective regions as well . in order to incorporate these effects of the convection in stellar models , various convection models",
    "have been proposed , including the most widely used mixing - length theory @xcite and more recently turbulent convection models @xcite .",
    "turbulent convection models are based on the averaged hydrodynamic moment equations , and include many properties of turbulence such as the local effects of generation , dissipation , anisotropy , and the nonlocal effect of turbulent transport .",
    "however , all of them suffer from a common problem , i.e. , the contributions from the convective rolling cells have not been considered up to now .",
    "consequently , these models either do not result in a steady state solution in the fully local equilibrium , or have to adopt a length model of turbulence similar to what has been introduced in the standard mixing - length theory .    in order to incorporate properly the effects of the convective rolling cells into the turbulent convection models , we have tried to find out the qualitative properties of the convective rolling cells in the stellar convection zone , by approximating the configuration of the convective rolling cells based on the results of the numerical simulations as a simple eddy structure with fluids moving circle by circle around the center of the eddy .",

    "the values of other parameters of the turbulent convection model are summarized in table 2 , as well as some basic properties of our solar models . in order for our solar models to have a depth of the convective envelope being in agreement with the result of helioseismic inversions ( @xmath208 ) , the initial metal abundance has to be fixed to @xmath209 which results in a higher @xmath210 ( 0.0255 ) compared to the recent observations ( 0.0181 ) @xcite .",

    "it can be seen that the two solar models have almost identical sound speed profiles , except for in a region about 5% below the solar photosphere . in order to show the difference of the two solar models just below the solar photosphere ,",
    "the profiles of the temperature gradient @xmath89 of mlt and of stc are compared in fig .",
    "3 , along with the adiabatic temperature gradient @xmath94 for reference .",
    "it can be seen that the turbulent convection model significantly reduces the temperature gradient just below the photosphere , which is a direct result of lower decreasing rate of the convective heat transfer efficiency of the turbulent convection model @xcite .",
    "the typical velocity of turbulent motions in the convection zone is compared in fig . 4 for the two solar models with mlt and stc .",
    "it can be noticed that the two turbulence models predict similar maximum velocities of turbulence ( about @xmath211 ) appeared just below the solar photosphere .",
    "but in most part of the convection zone , the stc predicts a typical velocity of turbulence ( about @xmath212 ) one order of magnitude lower than what the mlt does ( about @xmath213 ) .",

    "( 104 ) and ( 109 ) to the whole solar interior including the convection zone and overshooting regions located below and above it , in order to study the transport effect of turbulence .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "5 that the transport effect of the gradient diffusion turbulence model ( gdt ) is significant near the boundaries of the convection zone and in the overshooting regions .",
    "the typical velocity of turbulence roughly shows a linearly decaying law below the base of the solar convection zone , and according to results of different combinations of parameters values of the stellar turbulence model , the larger the parameter @xmath214 is , the steeper the decaying law will be , which requires a smaller @xmath206 to calibrate the model to the solar values .",
    "however , the turbulent velocity extends more or less constantly into the solar photosphere and lower atmosphere until they drop abruptly to the outer boundary conditions we have prescribed in the upper atmosphere .",
    "it is interesting to note that the typical velocity of turbulence is restricted below @xmath215 in the whole subphotospheric region due to the transport effect of turbulence , ensuring the thermally turbulent convection appearing there a subsonic motion as assumed in the stellar turbulence model . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical length of turbulent motion remains almost a constant in the overshooting region below the base of the solar convection zone as shown in fig .",
    "contrary to the local pressure scale height that decreases monotonically in the stellar envelope , the typical length of turbulence increases exponentially in the upper convection zone and overshooting region .",
    "this is a direct result of radiative dissipation that effectively increases the average size of convective rolling cells when the density drops rapidly in the solar convective envelope .",
    "we calculate a series of stellar evolution models of @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and @xmath220 , with the initial chemical abundance of @xmath221 and @xmath222 and parameters of turbulence models given in table 2 .",
    "element diffusion is not considered here for simplicity .",
    "the hr diagram is shown in fig . 7 for the stellar models with different masses .",
    "it can be seen that the evolution tracks of stellar models based on the mixing - length theory ( mlt ) and on the model of stellar turbulent convection ( stc ) are almost identical , except that the stc results in a series of red giant branches with a little bit lower effective temperatures .",
    "profiles of the typical velocity of turbulence are compared for @xmath217 models based on stc and gdt at the rgb bump in fig .",
    "8 , within which the envelope convection mostly penetrates inwardly into the stellar interior .",
    "it can be seen that the transport effect of turbulence is only significant below the base of the convective envelope , with an almost linearly decaying law similar to the solar case .",
    "on the other side , the turbulent velocity is effectively reduced in the upper convective envelope and diffused as nearly a constant value of @xmath215 into the stellar atmosphere .",
    "it is interesting to note in fig .",
    "9 , however , that the typical length of turbulence varies only in one order of magnitude around @xmath223 km in the whole convective envelope , decreasing linearly below the base of the convective envelope and increasing rapidly in the stellar atmosphere .    for a model of @xmath220 in the main sequence , the transport effect of turbulence results in significant effect on the turbulent velocity in the convective core , the maximum velocity of gdt being only 80% as seen in fig .",
    "10 as that of stc . outside the convective core",
    ", the turbulent velocity can be diffused into an overshooting region of about @xmath224 wide . however , the turbulent velocity is decaying more and more rapidly in the overshooting region , resulting in a considerably shorter distance of fully mixing for elements outside the convective core .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "11 , however , that the typical length of turbulence remains almost as a constant in the convective core and in the overshooting region , and its value is comparable to the size of the convective core .",
    "the typical length of turbulence sharply increases toward the stellar center due to the central boundary condition , which assumes the local equilibrium of turbulence at the center of a star .",
    "finally we apply the turbulence models of stc and gdt to a @xmath219 model in the post - main - sequence evolutionary stage .",
    "according to the mlt , convection is underdeveloped in the envelope of such a star and turbulent motions only appear in two thin shells and have almost no effect on the structure of the stellar envelope . as seen in fig . 12 , however , the transport effect dominates the turbulent motion , and the turbulent velocity is diffused in the whole upper envelope upward to the stellar atmosphere and downward several local pressure scale heights below the lowest convective boundary .",
    "the resulted maximum velocity of turbulence is substantially reduced from stc s @xmath225 to gdt s @xmath226 . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical length of turbulence remains almost a constant as seen in fig .",
    "13 , and its value is significantly increased to be comparable to the width of the convective region being formed thereabout by the turbulent diffusion .",
    "thermal convection is characterized in stars by convective rolling cells of different scales and a fully developed turbulence .",
    "such semi - regular and large scale structures play a critical role in determining the macro properties of the convective motions , by both acting as thermal engines to transform heat into the kinetic energy to maintain their cellular configurations and producing the velocity shear within the convective rolling cells to generate turbulence . due to great difficulties encountered both physically and numerically in dealing with such complex flows , turbulent convection models , which are based on fully hydrodynamic moment equations and include many physical properties of turbulence , have not jet taken the contributions from the convective rolling cells into account .    in order to investigate the qualitative properties of the convective rolling cells and to include their contributions to the development of turbulence , we simplify their configurations by eddies rotating circle by circle with differential angular velocities , and approximately describe their motions by equations of mass and energy conservation . with the aid of advanced turbulence models , this simple approach enable us to estimate the average size of the convective rolling cells by solving for the temperature difference over the stationary temperature background , and to approximate the generation rate of turbulence due to the average shear of velocity in the convective rolling cells . on the other hand , the restriction from the heat conversion efficiency of such convective rolling cells working as individual thermal engines leads to a direct limit on the turbulent kinetic energy enclosed in them and an indirect evaluation of the typical length scale of turbulence in the fully local equilibrium .",
    "based on these considerations and model assumptions thereof , we obtain the static solution of the standard @xmath0-@xmath1 model by properly introducing an important model parameter @xmath2 , and then develop a @xmath0-@xmath3 model including the turbulent transport effect to describe stellar turbulent convection .",
    "results of preliminary applications to the sun and other stars with different masses and in different evolutionary stages are in good agreement with those of the standard mixing - length theory and numerical simulations .",
    "being as an initial attempt to include the contributions from the convective rolling cells in the turbulent convection models , our approach have a lot of limitations and incongruities .",
    "the most significant among them lies in the simplistic assumption that the convective rolling cells are of an eddy - like configuration , which is proved to be inadequate for the surface layer convection in the solar convective envelope where the scale height of the density stratification is much smaller than the average size of the convective rolling cells .",
    "the huge variation of density in the convective rolling cells results in great changes on the topology of the flows , i.e. a distinct up / down asymmetry characterized by hot and slow up - flows separated by cold and fast down - drafts @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the properties of the convective flow is determined by the physical conditions along the whole streamline that the fluids go through during a complete cycle of the convective motion .",
    "such a nonlocal nature of the phenomenon , along with the huge range of variations of the density , significantly limits the validity of our approach by use of the local physical conditions to estimate the size of the convective rolling cells . besides , the actual size and shape of the convective rolling cells",
    "may also be restricted by geometric conditions , for examples , in the stellar convective core or in thin convective shells of the stellar envelope with a thickness smaller than the local size of the convective rolling cells ."
