    "the study of inhomogeneous cosmological models is a well motivated and justified endeavor ( see for reviews @xcite ) .",
    "these models provide more freedom in discussing very early or very late evolution of the irregularities in the universe .",
    "their study also complements perturbation approaches .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there are a few hundreds of inhomogeneous cosmological models that reproduce a metric of the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) class of solutions when their arbitrary constants or functions take certain limiting values @xcite .",
    "they become then , in that limit , compatible with the almost homogeneous and almost isotropic observed universe .",
    "this shows the richness of these studies .",
    "a difficulty that is encountered in this models is that the null geodesic equation is not integrable in general . in this paper , we explore the alternative of using null ( observational ) spherical coordinates in which the radial null geodesic equation of interest is solved by construction .",
    "however , when considering null coordinates and a given metric for the spacetime some subtleties arise regarding the frame of reference used . in order to explore this point we will use in this paper the approach described in ishak and lake@xcite where the velocity field is calculated from the metric and not put in by hand .",
    "conveniently , this approach allows one to explore non - comoving frames of reference , an important point for this paper .    surprisingly , little",
    "work has been done in non - comoving coordinates @xcite despite some interesting features particular to them .",
    "notably , there are models which are separable only in a non - comoving coordinate system @xcite .",
    "moreover , exact solutions to einstein s equations in a non - comoving frame usually have a rich kinematics with shear , acceleration and expansion .",
    "such solutions are relatively rare in the comoving frame @xcite , see also a recent discussion in @xcite . another point discussed in @xcite",
    "is that comoving coordinates do not cover all the spacetime manifold for a specified energy momentum tensor .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that it is often difficult to do the mathematical transformation of a given solution from non - comoving coordinates to comoving ones , and even when the passage is made , there is no guarantee that the solution will continue to have a simple or explicit form .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use the spherical null bondi metric @xcite to present models where a non - comoving frame is proven necessary .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate how a comoving frame leads to severe limitations .",
    "furthermore , we use the dust models in the non - comoving frame to outline a fitting procedure where observational data can be used to integrate explicitly for the metric functions .",
    "using observational coordinates is particularly useful when one wants to compare directly an inhomogeneous model to observational data .",
    "such an interesting program had been nicely developed in refs .",
    "@xcite where the authors used a general metric that can be written as a flrw metric plus exact perturbations .",
    "the spherically symmetric dust solutions were considered in ref .",
    "the authors also developed and used a fluid - ray tetrad formalism @xcite in order to derive a fitting procedure where observations can be used to solve the einstein s field equations .",
    "after some necessary revisions @xcite , this program has been relaunched recently @xcite .",
    "we consider here in our work the spherically symmetric case but using the bondi metric @xcite in a non - comoving frame .",
    "also , we do nt use the fluid - ray tetrad formalism @xcite but the inverse approach to einstein s equations developed in @xcite .    in the following section",
    ", we set the notation and recall some useful results . in section iii , we discuss observational coordinates and explain the cosmological construction around our world - line .",
    "we also discuss the physical meaning of the functions that appear in the metric used here .",
    "we provide in section iv perfect fluid models in a non - comoving frame . in section",
    "v , we show how dust models are not possible in a comoving frame .",
    "we describe dust models in a non - comoving frame and outline a fitting procedure in section vi and summarize in section vii .",
    "we set here the notation and summarize results to be used in this paper . in ref .",
    "@xcite , warped product spacetimes of class @xmath0 @xcite were considered .",
    "these can be written in the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "although very special , these spaces include many of interest , for example , _ all _ spherical , plane , and hyperbolic spacetimes . for @xmath6 , we write @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 functions of @xmath10 only . consider a congruence of unit timelike vectors ( velocity field ) @xmath11 with an associated unit normal field @xmath12 ( in the tangent space of @xmath6 ) satisfying @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath14 is uniquely determined from the zero flux condition @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the einstein tensor of the spacetime .",
    "the explicit forms for @xmath17 and @xmath18 were written out for canonical representations of @xmath6 , including the null ( bondi ) type of coordinates that we use in the present paper . with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the condition @xmath22 is a necessary condition for a perfect fluid source , and that in some cases , this condition is also sufficient .",
    "for example , in @xcite , equation ( [ giso ] ) was used to derive an algorithm which generates all regular static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of einstein s equations . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in perfect fluid sources so it is important to recapitulate the following results from @xcite . consider a fluid with anisotropic pressure and shear viscosity but zero energy flux ( non - conducting ) .",
    "the energy - momentum reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the energy density and @xmath25 is the shear associated with @xmath14 ; @xmath26 is the phenomenological shear viscosity ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the pressures respectively parallel and perpendicular to @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath29 and the shear term vanishes the fluid is called perfect .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in the case where @xmath30 we have @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath26 is a freely specified function .",
    "the procedure to impose a perfect fluid source in this degenerate case is to impose the condition ( [ giso ] ) and also necessarily set @xmath34 . for other choices of @xmath26 ,",
    "the fluid is viscous .",
    "we consider in the present paper the null coordinate system @xmath35 .",
    "these are called observational ( or cosmological ) coordinates as we can construct them around our galaxy world line c as indicated in figure [ coordinates ] .",
    "the trajectory defined by @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 constant is a radial null geodesic and each hyper - surface of constant @xmath36 is a past light cone of events on c. we choose @xmath39 and @xmath40 to represent the vertex `` here and now '' .",
    "the coordinate @xmath41 is then set by construction to be the area distance as explained further and is related to the luminosity distance @xmath42 by @xmath43 ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "finally , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the spherical coordinates on the celestial sphere .",
    "the geometry of the models is represented by the general spherical bondi metric in advanced coordinates @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the radial ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 constant ) ingoing null geodesic equation @xmath36=constant is solved by construction ( see appendix [ appnull ] ) .",
    "the components of the mixed einstein tensor @xmath48 for ( [ metric ] ) are given in appendix [ appeinstein ] and the structure of the weyl tensor is discussed in appendix [ appweyl ] .",
    "regularity of the metric and the weyl invariants requires that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are @xmath51 at @xmath40 ( e.g. see equation ( [ w ] ) ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath52 also , we can use the freedom in the null coordinate @xmath36 to normalize it by setting @xmath53 . as we will write further in this paper ( see equation ( [ normalization ] ) )",
    "this means that we require that @xmath36 measures the proper time @xmath54 along our galaxy world line c.    whereas the meaning of the metric function @xmath49 is very well known , we are not aware of any previous literature where an interpretation for @xmath50 was given .",
    "the function @xmath49 represents the effective gravitational ( geometrical ) mass ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mixed angular component of the riemann curvature tensor . for the physical meaning of the function @xmath50",
    ", it turns out to be useful to study the kinematics of null rays .",

    "the physical meaning of the optical scalars can be understood in the following way @xcite : if an opaque object is displaced an infinitesimal distance @xmath59 from a screen ( perpendicularly to the beam of light ) , it will cast on the screen a shadow that is expanded by @xmath60 , rotated by @xmath61 and sheared by @xmath62 . as expected from the spherical symmetry of the geometry ,",
    "the non - vanishing optical scalar for the null congruence @xmath63 is the optical rate of expansion , from which we find @xmath64 we identify from equation ( [ cvalue ] ) that @xmath65 is a measure of the reciprocal of the expansion of null rays .",
