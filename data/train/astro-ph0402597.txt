    "the compact remnants of the core collapse supernovae have masses in the range of 12 solar masses and radii of the order of 10 km .",
    "the interior of neutron stars consists of matter under extreme densities , several times the density of normal nuclear matter , @xmath0 g/@xmath1 .",
    "the study of neutron stars has considerably advanced during the last years . with new telescopes , ground - based and in satellites , one measures spectra of supernova remnants like the crab nebula",
    "not only in the optical but also in the x - ray ( chandra , xmm  newton ) , in radio as well as in the infrared band . the hubble space telescope and the chandra telescope has even published a movie of the crab nebula on  line !",
    "these movies demonstrate how the rotating neutron star , the crab pulsar , pushes out energetic wisps into the crab nebula in the equatorial plane as well as jets of matter along the polar axis .",
    "more than 1000 pulsars are known today .",
    "the masses of pulsars were measured most precisely from a few binary neutron star systems @xcite , especially from the hulse - taylor pulsar with @xmath2 .",
    "the shortest known rotation period so far measured is 1.557 ms for the pulsar psr 1937 + 21 .",
    "our knowledge about compact stars got a new twist by the discovery of isolated , non - pulsating neutron stars .",
    "the first one seen and the closest one known is rx j1856 @xcite being radio - quiet and with no pulsations .",
    "the thermal spectrum indicates a temperature of 49 ev in the optical band .",
    "the x - ray spectrum , however , shows a nice planck curve with a temperature of 60 ev as measured by the chandra satellite @xcite .",
    "most surprisingly , no spectral lines from elements in the atmosphere of the neutron star have been found in the spectra ! these puzzles of the spectra of the isolated neutron star are still not fully resolved ( see @xcite for a possible explanations ) .",
    "the revised and improved parallax measurement of rx j1856 gives a distance of @xmath3 parsec @xcite .",
    "an ideal black - body emitter would have a very small radius of @xmath4 km at that distance which is much smaller than the canonical value for a neutron star of 10 km @xcite .",
    "corrections from an atmosphere resulted in an apparent radius of @xmath5 km which would be compatible with most of the modern neutron star models on the market @xcite .",
    "the structure of neutron stars encompasses several distinctly different zones when going from the surface to the centre ( for a review see e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "first , there is a thin atmosphere up to about @xmath6 g/@xmath1 , mainly iron but could be also hydrogen or helium by accretion .",
    "then the outer crusts or the envelope begins which consists of free electrons and nuclei forming a coulomb lattice .",
    "the sequence of nuclei starts with iron and then continues to neutron - rich nuclei stopping at the neutron drip - line at about @xmath7 g/@xmath1 @xcite . the inner crusts consists of free neutrons in addition to nuclei and electrons where the neutrons are in a superfluid state .",
    "the nuclei can now form the pasta in the crust , various inhomogeneous phase structures as bubbles ( meat - balls ) , rods ( spaghetti ) , and plates ( lasagna ) immersed in the neutron and electron fluid .",
    "the sequence can then reverse , so that the neutron fluid forms the geometrical structures immersed in a background of extremely neutron - rich and superheavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "at about half times normal nuclear matter density , the matter distribution will be uniform , consisting of mainly neutrons with a small admixture of protons and electrons , where the protons can now form a superconductor .",
    "still , the end of the crust is located far away from the centre , as the crust is only a few hundred meters thick for massive neutron stars !    the core of the neutron star consists of matter under extreme densities .",
    "new forms of matter have been proposed to exist under these condition in the very core of compact stars : bose condensation of pions or kaons , phase transitions to hyperon matter ( hyperon star ) and quark matter ( hybrid star ) .",
    "if strange quark matter is absolutely stable , then the corresponding compact star is dubbed a strange star and the quark phase extends all the way from the centre to the neutron - drip line , as all free neutrons are swallowed by the true ground state of matter , while nuclei are saved by virtue of the coulomb barrier .",
    "now let us start with a simple consideration : let us assume that the high - density equation of state can be described by free ( known ) particles .",
    "the stable baryons known in vacuum are the nucleons ( n , p ) and hyperons ( the @xmath8 and @xmath9 with one strange quark , the @xmath10 with two strange quarks , and the @xmath11 with three strange quarks ) .",
    "the masses of the hyperons increases with the number of strange quarks . besides those , there are spinless mesons which are stable against strong interactions ( charged pions , and kaons with one anti - strange or one strange quark ) .",
    "they can form a bose condensate .",
    "a calculation of neutron star matter for a free gas of particles shows , that first the negatively charged @xmath12 appears at about @xmath13 and then the @xmath8 at about @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 appears before the @xmath8 despite the fact that it is slightly heavier , because it is negatively charged .",
    "the presence of the @xmath12 can then take over the rle of the electron in making the overall matter charge neutral , thereby lowering the fermi energy of electrons and the total energy of the system .",
    "one can compute that there will be no other particles in the composition of a free gas of hadrons up to @xmath15 which is well beyond the maximum density in the interior of a compact star ( besides that our approach will be not applicable anymore , as hadrons are composite particles ) .",
    "the corresponding equation of state will be even slightly softer than that of a a free neutron gas due to the appearance of additional particles .",
    "hence , the maximum mass is the one given by oppenheimer and volkoff for a free gas of neutrons which is about @xmath16 @xcite . that maximum mass is more than a factor two smaller than required by the measurement of the mass of the hulse - taylor pulsar of @xmath17 !",
    "neutron stars can _ not _ be described by a approximately free gas of particles , contrary to white dwarfs .",
    "interactions between hadrons are crucial for explaining such a large neutron star mass .",
    "as hyperons seem to appear in dense hadronic matter relevant for compact stars , we study in the following the interactions between baryons of the baryon octet ( nucleons , @xmath8 , @xmath18 s , and @xmath19 s ) in dense matter .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction is very well known from nuclear properties ( the general problem is , of course , how to extrapolate the interaction to densities beyond normal nuclear matter density ) . for hyperons",
    "the situation is far less clear but a lot of information can be gathered from hypernuclear data and hyperonic atoms ( for reviews see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "most of the hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interaction known experimentally indicates an attractive potential .",
    "the measured single particle levels of @xmath8 hypernuclei from mass numbers of @xmath20 to 209 result in a potential of @xmath21 mev at @xmath22 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known , that the @xmath8n interaction gets repulsive at densities of about @xmath23 and above @xcite , so this nonlinear behaviour with density has to be taken into account for the modelling of neutron star matter .    for @xmath18 s ,",
    "there is only one bound @xmath18 hypernucleus known , @xmath24he , which is , however , bound by isospin forces . @xmath12",
    "atomic data indicates a repulsive potential at @xmath22 @xcite assuming again a nonlinear density dependence of the optical potential .",
    "this finding is consistent with the absence of narrow @xmath18 hypernuclear states ( even in the continuum ) for the reaction @xmath25be(@xmath26,@xmath27 ) as measured at bnl @xcite .",
    "there are seven @xmath19 hypernuclear events reported in the literature , which are summarised in @xcite . correcting the @xmath19 vacuum masses for the older events ,",
    "one arrives at a relativistic potential of about @xmath28 mev at @xmath22 which is comparable to that of the @xmath8 . however , more recent indirect estimates of the @xmath19n interaction by final state interactions in the reaction ( @xmath26,@xmath29 ) on @xmath30c point towards a reduced attraction of about @xmath31 mev @xcite .",
    "double @xmath8 hypernuclear states have been also seen experimentally ( see @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "besides the three older candidates , there are two new measurements reported in 2001 .",
    "experiment e906 at bnl finds indications of about 400 produced @xmath32h on a @xmath25be target by the correlated emission of pions of the sequential weak decays .",
    "experiment e373 at kek reconstructs the production of a @xmath33he and its subsequent weak mesonic decays .",
    "there are difficulties to reconcile the old and the new data in detail , but the overall consensus is that the @xmath34 interaction must be attractive ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "note , that all other hyperon - hyperon interactions , as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are essentially unknown experimentally !",
    "the hyperon - hyperon interaction strength can be also probed by two particle correlations of e.g.  two @xmath8s in relativistic heavy - ion collisions as it was measured recently by the na49 collaboration @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the statistics does not allow for a definite conclusion about the size of the s - wave scattering length of two @xmath8s , although the data indicates a small scattering length . as a lot of hyperons",
    "are produced in a single central heavy - ion collision at relativistic bombarding energies , multiply strange nuclear systems can be produced in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "indeed , the hypernuclei @xmath40h and @xmath41h can be seen in the invariant mass spectra of the weak decay products of helium and a @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "building up more and more hyperons in a  nucleus ",
    ", the total binding energy of the system increases , as new degrees of freedom are filled up with a lower fermi energy than nucleons . however , in the multi - hyperonic medium new reaction channels are possible , as @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "these reactions are pauli - blocked , as the possible lowest lying @xmath8 hyperon states are filled up by @xmath8 s .",
    "hence , the whole multi - hyperonic nucleus can be stabilised by virtue of the pauli - blocking in the hyperon world !",
    "relativistic shell model calculations find that the binding energy can be @xmath44 mev / a or even @xmath45 mev / a , depending on the strength of the hyperon - hyperon interactions @xcite .",
    "even purely hyperonic  nuclei  , consisting of only @xmath8 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 hyperons can exist with up to @xmath48 mev / a binding energy .",
    "more importantly , the charge of these systems is negative , while the baryon number is positive  indeed , a quite unusual nuclear property .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , hyperons will appear within a free gas of hadrons but interactions have to be taken into account to be compatible with the observed neutron star masses .",
    "our more or less profound knowledge about the nucleon - nucleon , nucleon - hyperon , and hyperon - hyperon , the latter being the least well known of all , can be utilised to derive models for neutron star matter . in many different approaches",
    "emerges that hyperons , either the @xmath8 or the @xmath12 , appear in neutron star matter at about @xmath23 : in relativistic mean - field models @xcite , in a nonrelativistic potential model @xcite , in the quark - meson coupling model @xcite , in relativistic hartree ",

    "the @xmath47 is present in neutron star matter before the lighter hyperons @xmath50 and the @xmath51 appear by virtue of its negative charge .",
    "the hyperon fraction considerably rises with increasing density . at @xmath52 the @xmath8 fraction",
    "even exceeds that of the neutron , being then the most populated baryon in matter in @xmath53 equilibrium ( which may more aptly be called hyperon star matter ) .",
    "neutron stars are giant multi - hypernuclei @xcite !",
    "note , that at about @xmath54 , electrons disappear and the isospin partners have equal fractions , as the isospin potential is negligibly small at these densities . at that point ,",
    "the negatively charged @xmath47 balances the positive charge of the protons ! at even larger densities , the matter distribution approaches about equal fractions for all baryons and positrons can be present .",
    "the positrons can not annihilate as there are no more electrons in the system left .",
    "the overall effect of the presence of additional degrees of freedom in the composition of a neutron star , be it hyperons or any other particle , is to lower the pressure and therefore to soften the equation of state .",
    "the maximum allowed mass for a neutron star will then decrease , typically from say @xmath55 for a purely nucleonic star to about @xmath56 for a hyperonic star depending on the parameter set used for the nucleon ",

    "note , that the electron fraction starts to drop even before the critical density for the @xmath47 is reached .",
    "once the neutral @xmath8 fraction rises , the system lowers its energy by replacing protons with @xmath8s , thereby reducing again the fermi energy of electrons which are needed to balance the charge of the protons .",
    "one might think , that a repulsive potential for the @xmath19 would also remove them completely from the matter distribution as the @xmath18s .",
    "however , this is not the case , the @xmath47 still appears , now at @xmath49 .",
    "the underlying reason is , that the repulsive vector potential for the @xmath19s is a factor of two smaller than for the other hyperons and a factor three smaller than for nucleons as demanded by su(6 ) symmetry for the vector coupling constants .",
    "the repulsive contribution to the overall potential , the vector potential , has to dominate at large densities to avoid a collapse of matter .",

    "the @xmath34 interaction is attractive , maybe even more than the @xmath8nucleon interaction .",

    "recently , lattice simulations started to explore the phase diagram of qcd at finite quark chemical potential attempting to find the critical endpoint .",
    "the extension to finite @xmath80 is performed by reweighting techniques or a taylor expansion which will fail , of course , if @xmath81 gets large .",
    "so far , first lattice calculations find values of about @xmath82 mev @xcite . in any case",
    ", it is quite likely that there is a first order phase transition at finite density and low temperature which is right in the region of interest for neutron star matter .",
    "we now study the following picture of cold and dense matter : at low densities there are hadrons and at intermediate densities the description of dense matter will be more appropriate in terms of massive quarks .",
    "the transition from hadrons to massive quarks is assumed to be smooth .",
    "then there is a phase transition from massive quarks to massless quarks at the chiral phase transition @xmath83 . for @xmath84 , perturbative qcd",
    "is used as a model of the equation of state of qcd and for @xmath85 a matching to the low density equation of state has to be performed @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic potential can be computed up to order @xmath86 for massless quarks from which all thermodynamic observables are derived self - consistently ( pressure , energy density , and baryon number density ) .",
    "the renormalisation subtraction point needs to be fixed in the perturbative treatment .",
    "it should be proportional to the overall scale of the system and is chosen to be @xmath87 .",
    "one finds then , that the resulting pressure starts at some finite value of the chemical potential and approaches very slowly the stefan  boltzmann limit of a free gas . even at rather large densities ,",
    "say of @xmath88 , there are still sizable corrections to a simple free gas of quarks .",
    "the matching to the low density equation of state can happen basically in two ways : either the matching appears to be smoothly from the low to the high density part or the matching incorporates a drastic change of the slope of the pressure as a function of chemical potential .",
    "[ fig : matching ] depicts the situation schematically . if the pressure in the low density equation of state increases rapidly with density , the matching will be smooth and the phase transition is weakly first order . on the other hand , if the pressure rises slowly with density the phase transition will be strongly first order . now",
    "the matching of the two equation of states results in a significant change of the slope of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : matching ] . as the slope reflects just the number density , the baryon density as well as the energy density will jump at the matching point causing a strong first order phase transition .",
    "which situation is realized in nature , is not clear .",
    "nonrelativistic model calculations of asymmetric matter @xcite hint at that the pressure in the low density regime stays small up to about @xmath23 , being only a few percent of that of a free gas of quarks , so that a strong first order phase transition is not excluded a priori .        fig .",
    "[ fig : mrquark ] shows the mass  radius relation for various equation of states .",
    "the solid lines stand for pure quarks stars calculated in perturbative qcd , the long  dashed ones are calculated within the mit bag model , a free gas of massless quarks only modified by a constant bag pressure .",
    "the curves for quark stars start at zero mass and radius as the pressure vanishes at a finite energy density  no hadronic mantle has been taken into account which would change the mass  radius relation at small masses to large radii ( see e.g.  the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : mryy ] ) . the mass  radius relation for a purely hadronic equation of state is depicted on the right side of the plot . at some chosen critical density ,",
    "the phase transition to quark matter occurs .",
    "the corresponding hybrid stars have smaller radii . for @xmath90 , a new family of stable solution",
    "appears where the short  dashed line turns into a solid line .",
    "the matching is done for the quark matter equation of state producing quark stars with a rather low mass of only @xmath91 and a corresponding radius of only 6 km .",
    "depending on the matching of the hadronic to the quark matter equation of state , the new family of solution lies somewhere between the curves for pure hadronic and pure quark stars , i.e.  radii down to 6 km are in principle possible for the new family of compact stars .",
    "we note in passing , that there is a recent flurry of activity studying effects from color superconducting quark matter on the mass - radius relation of compact stars @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the previous discussion , that the studies of compact stars is far from being completed .",
    "further investigations of the nonperturbative treatments of the quark phase and how it matches to the low density equation of state are needed to elucidate the possible existence of a new family of compact stars .",
    "the recent data from present x - ray satellites , chandra and xmm newton , and the hubble space telescope have considerably advanced our knowledge of the properties of compact stars with more surprising news to come .",
    "future telescopes , like the x - ray satellite xeus and the next generation space telescope , are poised to finally pin down the mass  radius relation of compact stars and to determine the equation of state of cold and dense , strongly interacting matter .",
    "excitingly , this means also that the possible existence of hypercompact stars might be confirmed within the coming years !",
    "it is a pleasure to thank eduardo fraga , norman glendenning , matthias hanauske , rob pisarski , and igor mishustin with whom i collaborated on the topics addressed in these lectures and mark alford for comments .",
    "i am indebted to walter greiner and horst stcker for their continuous support which made this work possible .",
    "i especially thank walter greiner for inviting me to give these lectures ."
