    "the curved pil lies between these negative and positive polarity regions .",
    "the preflare phase started with a compact brightening at 11:35 ut ( figure 3(a ) ) .",
    "this brightening is most probably due to the interaction and reconnection between the northern and southern sheared field lines .",
    "the northern sheared field lines connect the regions p1 and n1 while the southern field lines connect the regions n2 and p2 .",
    "the reconnection is evidenced by the observed rhessi 36 and 612 kev sources over the reconnection region ( figures 3(b ) and 3(c ) ) .",
    "all the rhessi sources are mostly in the soft x  ray ( sxr ) range and they should lie in the corona . we do not observe any rhessi hard x  ray ( hxr ) footpoint sources , possibly because it is a weak event .",

    "figures 5(g)(i ) present the sdo / aia 171   images during the decay phase of the main flare from 13:05 to 13:45 ut .",
    "the main flare phase started with a compact brightening near the pil between polarities n1 and p2 ( figure 5(a ) ) .",
    "this may be due to the tether  cutting type reconnection at the middle of the sigmoid between the sheared field lines .",
    "a few minutes later , we found a jet  like ejection near the compact brightening area from 12:34 ut to 12:36 ut ( figures 5(a ) and ( b ) ) . figures 6(a)(e ) show the zoomed  in view of the jet in five sdo / aia wavelength channels .",

    "apparently , the base of the jet lies at the small negative polarity region , pointed by the green arrow in figure 6(f ) .",
    "the initial slow eruption of the sigmoid started simultaneously with the main flare phase at 12:31 ut . the low  lying tether  cutting type reconnection may be responsible for the eruption of the sigmoid .",

    "the initial slow speed comes out to be about 10 @xmath7 between 12:30 ut and 12:37 ut .",
    "then the motion of the sigmoid is accelerated to a higher speed of about 45 @xmath7 between @xmath612:37 ut and @xmath612:44 ut . the speeds are calculated from the linear fit to the measured height  time data . in order to understand the relation between the sigmoid eruption and the flare , the goes x  ray fluxes in 18 and 0.54   channels are overplotted .",
    "it is evident that the goes flux enhancement is simultaneous with the sigmoid eruption .",
    "the overall dynamics of the sigmoid eruption can be seen in the sdo / aia 131   running difference images ( figure 8 and the associated animation ) .",
    "it is evident from the observations that the main flare started with the eruption of sigmoid and formed extended flare ribbons ( figures 5(c)(f ) and the associated animation ) .",
    "figure 9 shows sdo / aia 1600   images presenting the evolution of flare ribbons .",
    "two sets of flare ribbons are observed ; the first set includes the two parallel ribbons on both sides of the inner curved pil , and the second is the large  scale circular ribbon .",
    "the two parallel ribbons appeared at 12:35 ut ( marked as r1 and r2 in figure 9(b ) ) about 4 minutes later than the start of the sigmoid slow rising motion .",
    "afterward , the size as well as the brightening of both the ribbons increased simultaneously with the sigmoid eruption ( figures 9(b)(d ) ) .",
    "the well  developed parallel ribbons appeared at around 12:44 ut ( figure 9(d ) ) . at this time",
    "the sigmoid rose to a height of about 2.6 mm from its original height of 3.2 mm .",
    "a continuous separation between the parallel ribbons has also been observed ( see the animations associated with figure 9 ) .",
    "the brightening of the circular ribbon , which is located to the northeast of both the parallel ribbons , started at 12:42 ut ( figure 9(d ) ) , about 11 minutes after the start of the sigmoid slow eruption .",
    "at this time the approximate height of sigmoid is about 4.86 mm .",
    "the brightening in the western part of the circular ribbon started at 12:45 ut ( figure 9(e ) ) .",
    "thereafter the brightening extends eastward up to 12:50 ut ( figure 9(f ) ) .",
    "however , we do not find much outward expansion of the circular ribbon .",
    "all the dynamical evolution of the ribbon formation and brightening extension can be clearly seen in the sdo / aia 1600   movie ( see the animation associated with figure 9 ) .",
    "figures 10(a)(e ) shows the well  developed circular flare ribbon as well as the two parallel ribbons in five euv wavelength channels of aia at 12:50 ut .",
    "the circular ribbon is marked by the white arrows .",
    "figure 10(f ) shows the sdo / hmi image overplotted by the aia 1600   image intensity contours in red color .",
    "the two parallel ribbons are formed after the reconnection in the wake of the erupting sigmoid and lie on the both sides of the center curved pil ( figure 10(f ) ) .",
    "the large quasi ",
    "circular ribbon was formed after the null  point reconnection and is located in the outer positive polarity regions ( figure 10(f ) ) .",

    "a detailed examination of the active region reveals fine thread  like structures ( i.e. , fine flux tubes ) joining the center negative polarity with the circular ribbon ( figure 10(g ) ) .",
    "some parts of them are shown by the dashed yellow lines .",
    "we also find that the area surrounded by the circular ribbon is much brighter than the outer region in hotter aia channels ( figures 10(b ) , ( e ) and ( g ) ) .",

    "a westward shift of the western footpoint source has been also observed .",
    "the hxr sources remain more or less observed there from 12:54 to 12:55 ut , while there is a consistent upward motion of the sxr sources .",
    "hxr sources are usually formed at the footpoints , while sxr sources are usually coronal sources that originate from flare loops .",
    "the morphology and dynamics of rhessi hxr and sxr sources match well with the standard model of solar flares .",

    "circular ribbon solar flares @xcite . in our study",

    "circular flare ribbon provides the observational evidence of the presence of the fan  spine type magnetic configuration @xcite . in our case",
    ", we also observed a typical large  scale circular ribbon that does not expand much , signifying the existence of the fan  spine type configuration ( see figures 9 , 10 and the associated animations ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we conjecture that the central ribbon may merge with the negative polarity parallel ribbon .",
    "it is also evident from the analysis that the circular ribbon lies at the positive polarity region around the center negative polarity region ( figure 10(f ) ) .",
    "the nlfff extrapolation result also shows that fan  like field lines connect the outer circular  ribbon regions with positive polarity to the central negative polarity region ( c.f .",
    ", figures 12(b ) ) . also , during the time of appearance of the circular ribbon in hotter corona aia channels , we found a high intensity area between the circular ribbon and the main flare site compared to the outer quiet area ( figures 10(b ) and ( e ) ) .",
    "this also provides an observational signature of the existence of a closed dome  like structure which is visible when hot plasma filled the fan lines .",
    "the nlfff extrapolation also reproduces large  scale field lines that appears like a dome ( c.f .",
    ", figures 12(b ) ) , which is very similar to the observations .",
    "we also found the observational evidence for the existence of sigmoid in the hotter temperature ( figure 3(e ) ) , which is believed to be located underneath the southern section of the fan dome .",
    "previous evidence for the existence of such kind of topology in large ",
    "scale has rarely been obtained @xcite . however , in our nlfff model analysis a coronal null related to the large scale circular ribbon may not exist .",
    "the whole event can be understood with the following two different phases .",
    "the preflare phase contains the dynamics of the formation and appearance of large sigmoid underneath the large fan dome structure ( section 3.2 and animation associated with figure 3 ) .",
    "the formation of the sigmoid can be explained via the tether  cutting reconnection between the low  lying sheared field lines ( see the schematic representation in figure 4 and @xcite ) .",
    "the formation process starts with the interaction and reconnection between the two sets of sheared field lines at the pil ( figures 3(a ) and 4(a ) ) .",
    "the existence of rhessi x  ray sources near the merging area shows the evidence of magnetic reconnection ( figures 3(c ) and 4(b ) ) .",
    "the two sets of sheared lines reconnected and formed the sigmoid ( figures 3(e ) and 4(c ) ) .",
    "recently , @xcite also studied the formation of the same sigmoid using _ interface region imaging spectrograph _ ( iris ) spectroscopic and aia imaging observations and interpreted its formation due to the flux cancellation process .",
    "we believe that the coronal tether  cutting reconnection is more appropriate to explain the formation of the sigmoid in the preflare phase .",
    "similar interpretations of the formation of the sigmoid have been reached in few recent studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a similar observation of the formation of the sigmoid underneath the fan dome and interpreted it as the reconnection between the sheared field lines .",

    "similar hot flux ropes signatures have been also observed in the past studies after some reconnection  driven heating of flux rope plasma @xcite .",
    "apart from this , it may be also possible that some part of the flux rope already exists there within the fan dome and during the preflare reconnection , where some new flux may be added to the pre  existing flux rope .",
    "the sigmoid that appeared may be a part of the existing flux rope .",
    "the triggering of the sigmoid eruption , the main flare reconnections and the formation of different sets of flare ribbons may be summarized using a simple schematic picture shown in figure 13 .",
    "the initial configuration is believed to be a fan  spine type with inner ( blue ) and outer ( red ) fan lines with a null point ( figure 13(a ) ) .",
    "the pre  existing sigmoid is represented by the thick black line . the sigmoid eruption and the formation of parallel ribbons can be interpreted using the tether  cutting scenario ( c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "first , the main flare starts with the tether  cutting reconnection between the low  lying sheared field lines ( shown by green color in figure 13(a ) .",
    "the compact brightening in the junction of the low  lying sheared lines in the middle is strong evidence of the tether  cutting reconnection ( figure 5(a ) ) .",
    "this can be interpreted as the first stage of the tether  cutting reconnection model .",
    "the reconnection region is shown by the white star in figure 13(a ) .",
    "this leads to the formation of large sigmoidal field lines , which may merge with the pre  existing field of the sigmoid ( thick green / black line in figure 13(b ) ) .",
    "this low  lying reconnection is believed to be responsible for the eruption of the sigmoid .",
    "this mechanism of sigmoid eruption is consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also observed a jet  like activity near this tether  cutting type reconnection region .",
    "we suspect that this jet  like activity may play some roles in triggering the sigmoid eruption by disturbing the surrounding magnetic field of the sigmoid ( figures 7 , 13(a ) and the associated animation ) .",
    "it is believed that the second stage of reconnection occurred underneath the sigmoid eruption between the overlying arcade field lines triggers the first stage of reconnection during eruption .",
    "this results in the formation of the parallel ribbons when the accelerated electrons hit the low solar atmosphere ( figures 9(d ) and 13(b ) ) .",
    "this scenario can be well supported by the standard solar flare model also known as the  cshkp \" model @xcite as well as the second stage of the tether  cutting model ( c.f . ,",
    "figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "several pieces of observation have been observed that are consistent with these models , including ( 1 ) the temporal correlation between the sigmoid eruption and the goes flux enhancement ( figure 7 ) , ( 2 ) the formation of parallel ribbons simultaneously with the eruption of the sigmoid ( figures 7(b ) and 9 ) , and ( 3 ) the observations of the hxr sources at the brightest kernels of the ribbons and their apparent separation motion ( figure 11 ) .",
    "all these observational signatures are quite strong to support the fact that the second stage flare reconnection is in between the surrounding arcades in the wake of a sigmoid eruption .",
    "later on , the erupting sigmoid also triggered a null  point reconnection between the inner ( blue ) and outer ( red ) fan field lines at the null point ( figure 13(b ) ) .",
    "this is the third stage of reconnection .",
    "the null  point reconnection accelerated the electrons towards the fan dome footpoints and produced the circular ribbon ( figures 9 , 10 and 13(b ) ) .",
    "moreover , the circular ribbon is seen as an extension of the parallel ribbon in the positive polarity region ( figure 9(d)(f ) ) .",
    "we conjecture that the center ribbon may coincide with the negative polarity parallel ribbon . till now only one flare event on 2011",
    "september 6 shows the existence of two different sets of flare ribbons @xcite .",
    "this kind of null  point reconnection and the associated circular or quasi  circular ribbon flares may be triggered either by the shearing motion of the fan field lines of fan  dome structure @xcite or due to the eruption of the sigmoid underneath the fan dome structure @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the underlying sigmoid was in the domain of torus instability .",
    "the magnetic reconnection within the low  lying sigmoid triggered its initial expulsion , which later triggered the breakout reconnection at the magnetic null . in our case",
    ", we also found that the erupting sigmoid triggered by the low  lying tether  cutting type reconnection caused the null ",
    "point reconnection later on .",
    "indeed , we also found that the sigmoid was rising about 11 minutes before the first appearance of the circular ribbon , which may provide another strong piece of evidence that the rising sigmoid was responsible to trigger null point reconnection ( figure 9(d ) .",
    "however , our nlfff model results do not show the location of the null point , but we strongly believe the existence of null point higher in corona .",
    "we also did not find signatures of remote brightenings .",
    "one possibility is that the intensity of the remote brightening may be too weak to be detected .",
    "the apparent counterclockwise brightening enhancement ( i.e. , starting from west and expanding to the east ) along the circular ribbon has been observed ( see the animation associated with figure 9 ) .",
    "this suggests that the reconnection at the null may be the slipping  reconnection type .",
    "similar kinds of counterclockwise brightening motions have been also observed in several studies but only for the smaller  scale flares @xcite . for the first time",
    "we are suggesting this type of two stage reconnection and the formation of two different sets of ribbons in great detail .",
    "no exact mechanism has been proposed for the triggering of flare producing this kind of two set of flare ribbons ( i.e. , parallel and circular ) and its association with the sigmoid eruptions .",
    "however , most of the results reveal that circular ribbon flares may be due to the null point type reconnection in a typical fan  spine configuration .",
    "more observational and simulation studies are required to understand these kind of flares in small as well as large  scale . in the future , we will try to work on similar more such events in order to understand the exact mechanism behind the triggering of flare reconnection which produces two different sets of flare ribbons i.e. , parallel and large ",
