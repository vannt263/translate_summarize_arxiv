    "it is a common belief that general relativity , despite its fabulous success in describing our universe at middle and large scale , has to be corrected at short distance . in particular",
    ", the apparent tension between einstein s theory and quantum field theory supports the idea that general relativity is merely an effective model that would be replaced in the uv  regime by a different theory , and such a _ new _ theory would ultimately permit us to make sense of what we call quantum gravity .",
    "the natural scale at which one expects such short distance corrections to manifestly appear is the planck scale @xmath4 , determined by the newton s coupling constant @xmath5 .    at present ,",
    "the most successful candidate to represent a quantum theory of gravity is string theory ( or its mother theory , m - theory ) .",
    "in fact , one of the predictions of string theory is the existence of a massless particle of spin @xmath6 whose dynamics at classical level is governed by einstein equations@xmath7    in addition , string theory also predicts next - to - leading corrections to ( baseepsilon ) , which would be relevant at distances comparable with the typical length scale of the theory @xmath8 .",
    "these short - distance corrections are typically described by supplementing einstein - hilbert action by adding higher - curvature terms @xcite , correcting general relativity in the uv  regime . as a result",
    ", the stringy spin @xmath6 interaction turns out to be _ finite _ , and this raises the hope to finally have access to a consistent theory of quantum gravity .    to investigate black hole physics in higher - curvature gravity theories , the first question we have to answer",
    "is whether such theories actually induce short - distance modifications to the black hole geometry or not . despite expectations that the inclusion of higher - curvature terms in the gravitational action yields modifications to general relativity , it is not necessarily the case that such modifications manifestly appear in the static spherically symmetric sector of the space of solutions .",
    "in fact , as we will see below , schwarzschild geometry usually resists modifications . in turn , first it is important to identify the theories of gravity that yield modifications to the spherically symmetric solution .      to warm up ,",
    "let us start by considering a very simple example of higher - curvature term .",
    "consider the action@xmath9which corresponds to einstein - hilbert action in four dimensions augmented with the square of the curvature scalar , where @xmath10 is a coupling constant with dimensions of @xmath11=$]length@xmath12 .",
    "this action is a particular case of the so - called @xmath13-gravity theories , which are defined by adding to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian a function of the ricci scalar @xmath14 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath13-gravity theories are equivalent ( after field redefinition that involves a conformal transformation ) to general relativity coupled to a scalar field @xmath15 , provided a suitable self - interaction potential @xmath16 that depends on the function @xmath17 ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in this sense , these theories are not different from particular models of quintessence . here",
    ", we are interested in less simple models ; however , let us consider ( [ quinta ] ) as the starting point of our discussion .",
    "a remarkable point is that the theory defined by action ( [ quinta ] ) admits ( anti- ) de sitter - schwarzschild metric as its static spherically symmetric solution . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath18 the theory still admits the schwarzschild solution even for @xmath19 , and it is due to the property @xmath20 .",
    "the theory defined by action ( [ quinta ] ) is not the only theory of gravity that admits schwarzschild metric as a persistent solution .",
    "actually , this is a rather common feature of theories with higher - curvature terms . in the case of quadratic terms in four dimensions this is an indirect consequence of the gauss - bonnet theorem , and because the kretschmann invariant @xmath21 is independent from the quadratic scalars @xmath22 and @xmath23 , quadratic deformation of einstein gravity may exclude schwarzschild - tangherlini solution . ] .",
    "a second example we can consider is einstein gravity coupled to conformally invariant gravity ; namely @xmath24where @xmath25 is a coupling constant and @xmath26 is the weyl tensor , whose quadratic contraction reads @xmath27    the equations of motion associated to this action read @xmath28where @xmath29 is the bach tensor , @xmath30    it is easy to show that , when @xmath18 , scwarzschild metric solves equations ( [ weeqs ] ) as well .",
    "this follows from the fact that bach tensor ( [ eq : bach ] ) vanishes if ricci tensor vanishes , and thus all solutions to general relativity are also solutions of ( [ weeqs ] ) .",
    "another example of a modified theory that admits schwarzschild metric as a solution is the jackiw - pi theory @xcite .",
    "this theory has recently attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the action @xmath31where the function @xmath32 is a lagrange multiplier that couples to the pontryagin density @xmath33 , constructed via the dual curvature tensor @xmath34where @xmath35 is the volume 4-form .",
    "the inclusion of the non - dynamical field @xmath32 comes from the fact that the pontryagin density @xmath33 is a total derivative .",
    "action ( [ eq : jp ] ) is often called chern - simons modified gravity ; however , this has to be distinguished from the chern - simons gravitational theories we will discuss in the section 2 .",
    "it is not hard to see that the equations of motion derived from action ( eq : jp ) are solved by the schwarzschild metric . actually , this is because the pontryagin density @xmath36 of schwarzschild metric vanishes .",
    "in contrast , kerr metric has non - vanishing pontryagin form , and thus it is not a solution of jackiw - pi theory . in fact , the rotating solution of this theory has not yet been found , and this represents an interesting open problem as the jackiw - pi theory is considered as a phenomenologically viable correction to einstein theory .",
    "summarizing , there are several models that , while representing short distance corrections to general relativity , still admit the schwarzschild metric as an exact solution . in particular",
    ", this implies that such models can not be the solution to problems like the issue of the black hole singularity .",
    "on the other hand , there are other models which , still being integrable , do yield deviations from general relativity solutions even in the static spherically symmetric sector . in this paper we will be concerned with one of such models",
    ". we will study a very special case of higher - curvature corrections to einstein gravity in higher dimensions , and we will see that substantial modifications to schwarzschild solution are found at short distances .",
    "in addition to higher - curvature corrections to einstein theory , string theory makes other strong predictions about nature . probably , the most important ones are the existence of supersymmetry and the existence of extra dimensions . in fact , one of the requirements for superstring theory to be consistent is the space - time to have @xmath37 dimensions ; and we learn from our daily experience that six of these extra dimensions have to be hidden somehow .",
    "this digression convinces us that studying higher - curvature modification of general relativity in higher dimensions seems to be important to address the problem of quantum gravity , at least within the context of string theory .",
    "this is precisely the subject we will study here .",
    "more precisely , in this paper we will investigate how the string inspired higher - curvature corrections to einstein - hilbert action modify the black hole physics in the uv regime .",
    "this turns out to be a very important question since the black holes are known to be a fruitful arena to explore gravitational phenomena beyond the classical level .",
    "the prototypical example we will analyze is @xmath38-dimensional quadratic lovelock lagrangian .",
    "but , first , before introducing this theory , let us begin by considering a much more general example . consider the action    @xmath39    where the constants @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the coupling constants for each quadratic term .",
    "the field equations obtained by varying the action ( [ eq : squad ] ) with respect to the metric read@xmath43    action ( [ eq : squad ] ) is the most general quadratic action one can write down in @xmath38-dimensions . for @xmath44 , the gauss - bonnet theorem permits to fix @xmath45 without loss of generality . in @xmath46 , however , three quadratic invariants are needed to describe the most general lagrangian of this type .    for generic values of the coupling constants @xmath40 @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the equations of motion ( [ ewem ] ) are fourth - order differential equations for the metric ( i.e. there are terms prportional to @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "nevertheless , a remarkable property of ( [ eq : squad ] ) is that there exists one particular choice of the coupling constants @xmath10 , @xmath47 and @xmath52 that results in the cancellation of all these higher order terms , yielding second order differential equations .",
    "it is easy to see that this choice is @xmath53 , which only gives a non - trivial modification to einstein theory for @xmath46 .",
    "actually , in @xmath54 and @xmath55 this choice corresponds to lovelock theory ( see ( [ l ] ) below ) ; namely @xmath56    it is worth emphasizing that this choice of coupling constants that yields second order equations of motion is _ unique _ ( up to a free parameter @xmath10 ) .",
    "this feature also holds in @xmath38 dimensions , and is a consequence of a more general result known as _",
    "the lovelock theorem _ @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will be mainly concerned with the theory defined by action ( [ eq : squad ] ) with @xmath53 .",
    "besides the _ uniqueness _ of the choice @xmath53 , which already makes this model interesting in its own right , let us say that this is exactly the effective lagrangian that appears in the low energy action of heterotic string theories in the appropriate frame ( and in m - theory compactifications too ) .",
    "now , let us sketch how the five - dimensional lovelock theory arises in the low energy limit of m - theory ( and , consequently , of string theory ) when the theory is compactified from @xmath57 ( resp .",
    "@xmath58 ) to @xmath59 .",
    "m - theory is supposed to be an extension of string theory ; a fundamental theory that , in certain regime , would flow to string theory @xcite .    this mother - theory ,",
    "if it exists , is yet to be found ; nevertheless , we do know what it has to look like in certain low energy limit : it has to look like eleven - dimensional supergravity augmented with higher - curvature terms .",
    "that is , the bosonic sector of the m - theory effective action is given by the graviton @xmath60 ( i.e. the metric ) and the 3-form gauge field @xmath61 ( with field strength @xmath62}$ ] ) .",
    "including the pure gravitational fourth order corrections @xmath63(@xmath64 ) , this effective action takes the form . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath65 + \\text { } ...",
    "\\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]where the ellipses stand for the fermionic content and higher - order contributions .",
    "these higher order contributions include terms like @xmath66(@xmath67 ) and also couplings of the form @xmath63(@xmath68 @xmath64 ) ; we will not consider these terms here .",
    "however , let us mention that the existence of the terms @xmath69 in the action above are related to the terms @xmath63(@xmath68 @xmath64 ) through supersymmetry , although indirectly .",
    "the tensor @xmath70 in the third line of ( baseasterisco ) is defined in terms of the way it acts on antisymmetric tensors of second rank , namely @xmath71where tr(@xmath72 ) refers to the trace of @xmath72 .",
    "the term in the fourth line in ( [ baseasterisco ] ) is actually one of the terms that appear in the lagrangian of lovelock theory ( see ( [ l ] ) below , where this term is expressed in an alternative way ) .",
    "in contrast , the term in the third line , which is of the same order , does not correspond to a term in the lovelock theory .",
    "a string theory @xmath69 contribution similar to that of the third and fourth lines of ( [ baseasterisco ] ) also appears in ten dimensions @xcite .",
    "this can be written as follows ] see @xcite for a recent discussion on these quartic terms in four dimensions . ]",
    "@xmath73    now , let us analyze",
    "what happens when the m - theory effective action we discussed above ( including the higher - curvature terms @xmath74 ) is compactified to five dimensions .",
    "let us assume we reduce from @xmath57 to @xmath75 by compactifying six of the eleven dimensions in compact calabi - yau ( cy@xmath76 ) threefold . in that case , the effective action of the five - dimensional theory takes the form @xcite @xmath77where we used units such that @xmath78 , and where the coupling @xmath79 is a quantity that depends on the _ details _ of the internal cy@xmath76 manifold are the components of the second chern - class of the @xmath80 calabi - yau space , while @xmath81 are the so - called scalar components of the vector multiplet , which are proportional to the khler moduli of the calabi - yau ; see also @xcite . the quantity @xmath82 is given by the integral of the 6-dimensional extension of the 4-dimensional euler characteristic over cy@xmath83 , namely @xmath84 .",
    "in addition , the dimensional reduction of terms @xmath69 gives raise to other corrections , like the shifting of the coefficient of the einstein - hilbert term . ] .    in turn",

    "] of ( [ baseasterisco ] ) .",
    "we observe that action ( [ ewemm ] ) resembles a particular case of ( [ eq : squad ] ) , namely the case @xmath54 with @xmath87 , identifying @xmath88 .",
    "this is precisely the theory we will study in this paper : the most general quadratic theory of gravity with equations of motion of second order , which , as we have just seen , arises as calabi - yau compactifications of m - theory .",
    "we already mentioned that a quadratic action similar to ( [ ewemm ] ) also appears in the 1-loop corrected effective action of heterotic string theory .",
    "written in the einstein frame , the coupling of higher - curvature terms in the heterotic effective action is given by @xmath89 , where the dilaton field @xmath15 clearly contributes .",
    "black holes solutions in dilatonic einstein - gauss - bonnet theory were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "because an action like ( [ ewemm ] ) also appears in the effective action of the heterotic string , it is also usually referred to as `` string inspired higher - curvature corrections '' . in turn , it represents a nice model to explore the effects of next - to - lading contributions of string theory to gravitational physics . in particular , this five - dimensional ( lovelock ) model of gravity was recently considered in the context of ads / cft holographic correspondence @xcite . actually , one of the applications of the lovelock theory to ads / cft that has attracted attention recently was that of showing that the so - called kovtun - son - starinets bound @xcite may be violated in a theory that contains higher - curvature corrections .",

    "particular _ case of lovelock gravity since the einstein - hilbert term is one of several terms that constitute the lovelock action .",
    "besides , lovelock theory also admits other quoted models as particular cases ; for instance , this is the case of the so called chern - simons gravity theories , which in a sense are actual gauge theories of gravity .    on the other hand ,",
    "lovelock theory resembles also string inspired models of gravity as its action contains , among others , the quadratic gauss - bonnet term , which is the dimensionally extended version of the four - dimensional euler density .",
    "this quadratic term is present in the low energy effective action of heterotic string theory @xcite , and it also appears in six - dimensional calabi - yau compactifications of m - theory ; see strominger and references therein . in @xcite zwiebach",
    "earlier discussed the quadratic gauss - bonnet term within the context of string theory , with particular attention on its property of being free of ghost about the minkowski space . besides , the theory is known to be free of ghosts about other exact backgrounds @xcite .",
    "for a nice and concise review on stringy corrections to gravity actions @xcite  see the introduction of @xcite and references therein .",
    "for interesting recent discussions on higher order curvature terms see @xcite and related works .",
    "the lovelock theory represents a very interesting scenario to study how the physics of gravity results corrected at short distance due to the presence of higher order curvature terms in the action . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with the black hole solutions of this theory , and we will discuss how short distance corrections to black hole physics substantially change the qualitative features we know from our experience with black holes in gr .",
    "so , let us introduce the lovelock theory .",
    "the lagrangian of the theory is given as a sum of dimensionally extended euler densities , and it can be written as follows @xcite@xmath105where the generalized kronecker @xmath106-function is defined as the antisymmetric product @xmath107}^{\\nu _ { n}}.\\ ] ]",
    "each term @xmath108 in ( [ l ] ) corresponds to the dimensional extension of the euler density in @xmath109 dimensions - dimensional euler density @xmath110 is given by @xmath111m@xmath112 , where , again , we are not considering the boundary terms .",
    "] , so that these only contribute to the equations of motion for @xmath113 . consequently , without lack of generality , @xmath114 in ( [ l ] ) can be taken to be @xmath115 for even dimensions and @xmath116 for odd dimensions .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath117 in ( [ l ] )  have dimensions of [ length]@xmath118 , although it is convenient to normalize the lagrangian density in units of the planck scale @xmath119 .",
    "expanding the product in ( [ l ] ) the lagrangian takes the familiar form@xmath120where we see that coupling @xmath121 corresponds to the cosmological constant @xmath122 , while @xmath117 with @xmath123 are coupling constants of additional terms that represent ultraviolet corrections to einstein theory , involving higher order contractions of the riemann tensor @xmath124 .",
    "in particular , the second order term @xmath125 is precisely the gauss - bonnet term discussed above .",
    "the cubic term still has a moderate form @xcite , namely @xmath126the fourth order term @xmath127 coincides with the pure gravitational term in the last line of ( [ baseasterisco ] ) .    even though the way of writing lovelock action in its tensorial form ( l2)-([cubo ] ) may result clear to introduce the theory , it is not the most efficient way for most of the calculations one usually deal with",
    ". a more convenient way of working out these expressions is to resort to the so - called first - order formalism , which turns out to be useful both for formal purposes and for practical ones .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to point out that the first - order formalism is not necessarily equivalent to the second - order formalism , so it should not be regarded merely as a different nomenclature . in the first - order formalism , both the vielbein @xmath128 and the spin connection @xmath129 are considered as independent degrees of freedom , and the torsion acquires in general propagating degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "it is only in the torsion - free sector where both formulations are equivalent ; notice that the vanishing torsion condition is always allowed by the equations of motion ; see @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "we will make use of the first - order formalism at the end of section 2 , as it is almost unavoidable in the discussion of chern - simons theory .",
    "however , with the intention to make the exposition as friendly as possible , we will avoid abstruse notation in the rest of the paper . in any case , since we could not afford to give all the definitions necessary to introduce the subject , we will assume the reader is familiarized with basic notions of the theory of gravity and with the standard nomenclature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we analyze the spherically symmetric black hole solutions in lovelock theory @xcite . in five - dimensions this is given by the boulware - deser solution boulwaredeser , whose most important properties we review .",
    "the special properties of electrically charged black holes @xcite are also briefly discussed . in one of the subsections of section 2 , we extend the analysis to those black objects whose horizon geometries correspond to more general spaces of constant ( but not necessarily positive ) curvature @xcite .",
    "these are the so - called topological black holes , which can be thought of as black brane solutions of the theory .",
    "also , we briefly review the most relevant features of the lovelock black hole thermodynamics @xcite , focusing our attention on the qualitative features that have no analogue in gr . throughout the discussion",
    ", the five - dimensional black hole of the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory will serve as prototypical example . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the role of boundary terms @xcite and the junction conditions these yield @xcite .",
    "we show how solutions with non - trivial topology can be constructed by a method of a geometric surgery .",
    "particular attention is focussed on vacuum wormhole solutions recently found gravaniswillison3 , gggw . finally , we study the spherically symmetric solutions that develop naked curvature singularities .",
    "we study these naked singularities with quantum probes and show that , in spite of the divergence in the curvature , these spaces are well - behaved within a quantum mechanical context .",
    "let us first consider the theory in five dimensions . since in @xmath130 the @xmath131 term does not contribute to the equations of motion , the five - dimensional lovelock theory basically corresponds to einstein gravity coupled to the dimensional extension of the four dimensional euler density , i.e. the theory that is usually referred as einstein - gauss - bonnet theory ( egb ) .",
    "the spherically symmetric static solution of egb theory was obtained by boulware and deser in ref .",
    "the metric takes the simple form @xcite@xmath132where @xmath133 is the metric of a unitary @xmath134-sphere , and where the metric function @xmath135 is given by@xmath136with @xmath137 .",
    "here we used the standard convention @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and , besides , we have set the newton constant to a specific value for short . from ( [ sol ] )",
    "we notice that there exist two different branches of solutions to the spherically symmetric ansatz ( [ intervalo ] ) , namely @xmath140 and @xmath141 , and this reflects the fact that the equations of motion give a differential equation quadratic in the metric function  @xmath135 . as usual",

    "it is worth mentioning that ( [ intervalo])-([sol ] ) is the most general spherically symmetric solution to egb theory , provided the fact that the metric is smooth everywhere and that the parameters @xmath122 and @xmath97 are generic enough . in turn",
    ", a birkhoff theorem holds for this model @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that for very particular choices of the set of parameters @xmath117 , degeneracy in the space of solutions can appear , and in those special cases the birkhoff s theorem can be circumvented ; see @xcite for a very interesting discussion . to our knowledge",
    ", the most complete analysis of the egb analogue of birkhoff s theorem was performed in @xcite , where the nariai - type solutions @xcite where also discussed .",
    "if @xmath96 , the solution corresponding to @xmath141 in ( [ sol ] ) may represent a black hole solution whose horizon , in the case @xmath18 , is located at @xmath149 . on the other hand , as long as @xmath150 and @xmath151 , the branch @xmath140 has no horizon but presents a naked singularity at @xmath152 .",

    "the branch @xmath140 is commonly believed to be a false vacuum of the theory , and it is known to present ghost instabilities @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "the branch @xmath141 , on the other hand , is well - behaved , and it represents short distance corrections to gr black holes ( [ sol1 ] ) .",

    "all these features are essentially due to the nature of the gauss - bonnet term , and also hold in higher dimensions .",
    "in fact , it is straightforward to generalize solution ( [ intervalo ] ) to the case of egb gravity in @xmath166 dimensions , and the metric is seen to adopt a very similar form @xcite .",
    "actually , it is given by simply replacing the element of the @xmath134-sphere in ( [ intervalo ] ) by the element of the unitary @xmath167-sphere @xmath168 , and by replacing the piece @xmath169 in ( [ sol ] ) by @xmath170 .",
    "in spite of the non - polynomial form of ( [ sol ] ) , the horizon structure of boulware - deser solution is quite simple , and in @xmath38 dimensions the horizon location is given by the roots of the polynomial @xmath171 where @xmath122 has been appropriately rescaled by a @xmath38-dimensional constant factor .    from ( [ fromesta ] ) we observe that the five - dimensional case is actually a remarkable example since , among other special features , it allows to have massive solutions with naked singularities .",

    "for instance , such a solution was recently studied by maeda and dadhich in ref .",
    "these kaluza - klein black holes are given by a product m@xmath222h@xmath223 between a four - dimensional manifold m@xmath224 and a @xmath225-dimensional hyperbolic space h@xmath223 .",

    "we discuss black hole thermodynamics in the next subsection .",
    "the purpose of this section is to describe the general aspects of black hole thermodynamics in lovelock theory .",
    "in fact , one of the most interesting features of the lovelock theory regards the thermodynamics of its black hole solutions .",
    "this is because it is in the analysis of the black hole thermodynamics where the substantial differences between lovelock theory and einstein theory manifest themselves .",
    "pioneer works where the lovelock black hole thermodynamics was discussed in detail are references @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , jacobson and myers derived a close expression for the entropy of these solutions in @xmath38 dimensions , and they showed that the entropy of these black holes does not satisfy the area law , but contains additional terms that are given by a sum of intrinsic curvature invariants integrated over the horizon .",
    "the thermodynamics of charged solutions was originally studied by wiltshire in refs .",
    "@xcite , while the thermodynamics of topological black holes was studied more recently , in refs .",
    "the study of charged topological black holes in presence of cosmological constant was addressed in @xcite , where the most general solution of this type in egb  theory was obtained .",
    "references @xcite also analyze topological black holes and their thermodynamics ; see also @xcite .    the aim of this section is to discuss the more relevant thermodynamical features of lovelock solutions . to do this , we will consider again the five - dimensional case ( [ intervalo])-([sol ] ) . actually , besides it represents a simple instructive example , the five - dimensional case is also special in what concerns thermodynamical properties .",
    "it is the best example to see that substantial differences between lovelock gravity and einstein gravity exist .",
    "it is easy to verify that the hawking temperature associated to the solution in @xmath54 with @xmath18 is given by    @xmath233    then , we see that , as expected , ( [ t ] )  behaves like the hawking temperature of a gr solution if the black hole is large enough , @xmath234 , going like @xmath235 . on the other hand",
    ", temperature tends to zero for small values of @xmath236 , going like @xmath237 .",
    "this implies that the specific heat changes its sign at length scales of order @xmath238 , and a direct consequence of this phenomenon is that five - dimensional lovelock black holes turn out to be thermodynamically stable , as they yield eternal remnants . this can be easily verified by considering the rate of thermal radiation which goes like @xmath239 , behaving like @xmath240 at short distances .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth pointing out that for dimension @xmath166 the functional form of the temperature is substantially different from the case @xmath241 , as it includes an additional term which is actually proportional to @xmath242 .",
    "the general formula reads    @xmath243    which implies that , in @xmath166 , the short distance limit is given by @xmath244 , and the specific heat is then negative .",
    "this is the reason why the thermodynamic behavior of higher dimensional einstein - gauss - bonnet black holes turns out to be more similar to that in einstein theory if @xmath245 . in general ,",
    "eternal black holes arise in @xmath246 dimensions if an @xmath247-order term @xmath108 is present in the action .",
    "so , let us return to our instructive example of five dimensions .",
    "the entropy associated to ( [ t ] ) is given by    @xmath248    from what we observe that black holes of lovelock theory do not in general obey the bekenstein - hawking area law .",
    "actually , some particular solutions , corresponding to topological black holes with flat horizon geometry @xmath249 , do obey the area law @xcite , but it is not the case for spherically symmetric static solutions .",
    "a very interesting discussion on the area law is that of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a version of the area law for symmetric dynamical black holes defined by a future outer trapping horizon was derived . there ,",
    "the authors discussed the differences between the branches of solutions with gr limit and those without it , and argue how for the latter one still can define a concept of increasing dynamical entropy .",
    "notice that the second term in the right hand side of ( [ s ] ) implies that if @xmath250 then the entropy turns out to be negative for sufficiently small black holes .",
    "this was discussed in @xcite , where it was argued there that an additive ambiguity in the definition of the entropy could be a solution for the negative entropy contributions ; see also the related discussion in @xcite . in any case , the theory for negative values of the coupling constant @xmath10 is somehow pathological in several respects .",
    "it not only gives negative contributions to the entropy , but also ghost instabilities and strange causal structure arise if @xmath250 .",
    "we will not consider the negative values of @xmath10 here .    because of the current interest in black hole thermodynamics of higher order theories , we consider convenient to mention that the entropy function formalism , recently proposed by a. sen @xcite within the context of the attractor mechanism , works nicely for the case of lovelock black holes . in particular , this was recently studied in @xcite for the case of egb black holes , and it was explicitly shown that ( [ s ] ) is recovered by analyzing the near horizon geometry .",
    "a rather general analysis was presented in ref .",
    "very interesting discussions are those of refs . qwert9,qwert10 .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of topological black holes are also very interesting ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "as we already mentioned , it can be shown that those black objects whose horizons are of zero curvature do obey the area law for the entropy density .",
    "for instance , consider the black brane geometry ( [ brane ] ) , which is solution of the theory with negative cosmological constant , @xmath212 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the hawking temperature of this solution is given by    @xmath251    and that the area formula for the entropy density does hold in this special case .",
    "remarkably , identical expression for the temperature is obtained in the particular case of the chern - simons theories of gravity , which we discuss in the next subsection .",
    "now , let us move on , and analyze a very particular case of lovelock theory which exist in odd dimensions .",
    "this is the so - called chern - simons gravity ( cs ) , and can be thought of as a higher - dimensional generalization of the chern - simons description of three - dimensional einstein gravity @xcite . basically , these theories are those particular cases of lovelock lagrangian ( [ l ] ) that admit a formulation in terms of a chern - simons action . as we will discuss , these models are given by a very precise choice of the set of coefficients @xmath117 .    to discuss cs gravity theories it is convenient  to resort to the first - order formalism which , in spite of its advantage , it is paradoxically avoided in physics discussions .",
    "so , let us first review some basic notions : consider the vielbein @xmath252 , which defines the metric as @xmath253 , where we are using the standard notation such that the greek indices @xmath254 correspond to the space - time while the latin indices @xmath255 are reserved for the tangent space .",
    "now , consider the 1-form associated to the vielbein , defined by @xmath256 , and the corresponding 1-form associated to the spin connection @xmath129 , defined by @xmath257 .",
    "these quantities enable us to define the so - called curvature 2-form , which is given by @xmath258and is related to the riemann tensor by @xmath259 .",
    "the torsion - free condition is then given by @xmath260    in this language , local lorentz invariance of the theory is expressed in terms of the covariant derivative @xmath261where @xmath262 represent the parameters of the transformation .",
    "the remarkable fact is that , for particular cases of the action ( [ l ] ) , if the coupling constants are chosen appropriately , the theory exhibits an additional local symmetry .",
    "for instance , if we consider the case @xmath18 , such additional symmetry turns out to be given by the invariance of the lagrangian density under the gauge transformation@xmath263    that is , the cs theory possesses a local symmetry under gauge transformation @xmath264 , with @xmath265 being a parameter .",
    "this is actually an off - shell local gauge symmetry of the theory ( [ l ] ) that arises for special choices of the coupling constants @xmath117 , as far as the boundary conditions are also chosen in the appropriate way . besides",
    ", it can be easily verified that transformation ( [ dos ] ) , once considered together with ( [ uno ] ) , satisfies the poincar algebra @xmath266 , and this is why these theories are usually referred as poincar - chern - simons gravitational theories @xcite ; see also @xcite for an excellent introduction to chern - simons gravity .",
    "so , let us specify which are the theories that possess the gauge symmetry like ) is the transofrmation that corresponds to the case @xmath18 .",
    "the analogous tranformation for the case @xmath267 takes a slightly different form , see @xcite . ]",
    "( [ uno])-([dos ] ) , namely the cs theories . to do this ,",
    "first it is convenient to rewrite the lovelock lagrangian . in the first - order formalism",
    ", the lovelock action corresponding to ( [ l ] ) in @xmath116 dimensions can be written as    @xmath268    where @xmath269 correspond to @xmath114 independent coefficients that are a rearrangement of the coefficients @xmath117 . in ( [ mn ] ) , the convention is such that the @xmath270 coupling @xmath271 has been set to @xmath272 ( or , alternatively speaking , it has been absorbed in the definition of the curvature @xmath273 ) , so that in this notation we have @xmath274 .",
    "it is worth noticing that , in order to represent the most general form of ( [ l ] ) , the coefficients @xmath269 in ( [ mn ] )  should be allowed to take complex values .",
    "in fact , lovelock action ( [ l ] ) with real coefficients @xmath117 can correspond to ( [ mn ] ) with imaginary @xmath275 .",
    "an example is given by the five - dimensional theory whose action reads @xmath276 , which leads to the particular form of ( [ l ] ) where no einstein - hilbert contribution is present , but only the cosmological constant and the gauss - bonnet term appear , with @xmath277 for a real @xmath47 .",
    "the cs gravity theories , however , are given by real values of @xmath269 .",
    "more precisely , cs  theory correspond to the special case where the coupling @xmath278 in ( [ mn ] ) combine to give only one value for the effective cosmological constant @xmath279 . in terms of the lagrangian density ( [ l ] )",
    "this corresponds to taking the coupling constants @xmath117 to be @xmath280 for@xmath281 , while @xmath121 is given by the cosmological constant @xmath282 .",
    "it is important to mention that ( [ mn ] ) corresponds to the case of negative cosmological constant , which yields the cs theory with the ads@xmath283 group ( i.e. the group @xmath284 ) as the one that generates the gauge symmetry .",
    "the case of positive @xmath122 is simply obtained by changing @xmath285 , while the poincar invariant theory is obtained through the inonu - winger contraction of ( a)ds group ; see zanelli for details .",
    "an example of poincar invariant cs is given by the lagrangian containing only the quadratic gauss - bonnet @xmath286 term in five dimensions , without the einstein - hilbert term and with @xmath287 .",
    "as it is well known , an example of the cs gravity theory is given by three - dimensional einstein theory , whose action.],@xmath288admits to be formulated as a cs theory .",
    "to see this , and then extend the construction to higher dimensional cases , let us first point out that ( quince ) can be written as follows,@xmath289with @xmath290 .",
    "it turns out that ( [ quince])-([secasa ] ) admits to be formulated as a cs theory @xcite  for the groups @xmath291 , @xmath292 and @xmath266 , depending on whether the cosmological constant @xmath122 is negative , positive or zero , respectively . to make contact with the usual form of the cs action ,",
    "let us introduce a ( @xmath293)-dimensional 1-form @xmath294 whose indices run over @xmath295 ( recall @xmath116 ) , and its strength field @xmath296 , which are given by@xmath297that is , @xmath298 for @xmath299 , while @xmath300 for @xmath301 .",

    "local symmetry under ( [ uno ] ) and ( [ dos ] ) is then gathered by gauge symmetry of ( [ scs ] ) .",
    "the next example we could consider is the five - dimensional one , which corresponds to the lovelock theory ( [ l ] ) for the particular case @xmath311 ( i.e. @xmath312 )",
    ". then , the action reads    @xmath313    where @xmath314 and @xmath315 .",

    "now , once we have introduced the theories , let us analyze their black hole solutions .",
    "going back to solution ( [ intervalo ] ) , and considering again the five - dimensional case as an example , we observe that replacing the chern - simons condition and @xmath212 . ]",
    "@xmath318 in the metric function ( [ sol ] ) leads to a rather different geometry , given by @xmath319    this solution still may represent a black hole , provided @xmath320 , with the horizon located at @xmath321 .",
    "however , this is a black hole of a different sort . in particular",
    ", it does not present a limit where gr is recovered , and this can be understood in terms of the condition @xmath322 in the following way : while the cosmological constant @xmath122 introduces an infrared cut - off ( the length scale @xmath323 ) where the cosmological term dominates over the einstein - hilbert term , the gauss - bonnet term introduces an ultraviolet cut - off ( the length scale @xmath324 ) where the quadratic terms dominate .",
    "therefore , the condition @xmath322 basically states that in chern - simons theory both length scales are of the same order , and consequently there is no range where the einstein - hilbert term is the leading one .",
    "this explains why there is no range where ( [ sol2 ] ) approaches schwarzschild - tangherlini solution .",
    "this asphyxia of the einstein - hilbert term is a typical feature of chern - simons theories for @xmath325 , where a unique free parameter @xmath326 appears in the action .",
    "the hawking temperature associated to black hole solution ( [ sol2 ] ) is given by@xmath327which in turn agrees with ( [ agree ] ) , although now it corresponds to a spherically symmetric solution .",
    "as it is well known @xcite in @xmath328 formula ( [ naitin ] ) agrees with the area law .    certainly , solution ( [ sol2 ] ) is reminiscent of the baados - teitelboim - zanelli three - dimensional black hole ( btz ) , which , after all , also corresponds to a cs black hole .",
    "in fact , this is not a coincidence , and regarding this , let us make a historical remark : it turns out that , even though one could imagine that cs black holes ( [ sol2 ] ) were discovered as higher - dimensional extensions of the btz , the story was precisely the opposite : in 1992 , baados , teitelboim and zanelli discovered the btz as a particular case of a family of lovelock black holes they were studying at that time @xcite .",
    "the analogy between the btz  black hole and those solutions for higher - dimensional cs theories was discussed in detail in @xcite . in particular , it was emphasized there that five - dimensional solution ( sol2 ) shares several properties with its three - dimensional analogue .",
    "for instance , it is the case of their thermodynamics properties , which , after all , are actually encoded in the function @xmath135 .",
    "this is also why all cs black holes have infinite lifetime .",
    "notice that the parameter @xmath329 in eq .",
    "( [ sol2 ] ) plays the role that the mass @xmath142 plays in the btz solution .",
    "also , as in the three - dimensional case , the anti - de sitter space is obtained for a particular value of this parameter , namely @xmath330 , and a naked singularity is developed for the range @xmath331 .    in @xcite the cs black holes and their dimensional extensions were exhaustively studied , together with their topological and charged extensions .",
    "there , a very interesting class of black holes was found by considering the particular choice of coefficients that leads to the @xmath332-dimensional cs theory , but dimensionally extending the action from @xmath333to @xmath334 .",
    "the metrics of such solutions are given by replacing the constant @xmath329 in ( [ sol2 ] ) by the quantity @xmath335 .",
    "a further generalization of the solutions of @xcite would be given by adding a volume term to the gravitational action , which in turn corresponds to shifting the coupling @xmath336 but keeping the rest of @xmath337 tuned as they are in the ( @xmath338)-dimensional cs theory , given in terms of the length scale @xmath326 .",
    "the solution for this case is given by replacing the constant @xmath329 in ( [ sol2 ] ) by a term @xmath339 , where @xmath340 .",
    "these black holes do have a gr limit since now the cosmological length scale can be pushed away by choosing @xmath341 appropriately .",
    "it is also important to mention that black hole solution ( [ sol2 ] ) is also a solution of the cs theory with torsion giacomini , giacomini2,qwert11 .",
    "the solutions of chern - simons theory are very special ones , and this is due to the fact that for that specific choice of the coupling constants @xmath342 the equations of motion of lovelock theory somehow degenerate . in particular , it is remarkable that the obstruction imposed by birkhoff - like theorems does not hold for cs theories .      before concluding this section , a word on the spinning black hole case :  the problem of finding a rotating solution in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity , which would generalize the kerr s spinning black hole of gr , is a hard and still unsolved problem .",
    "recently , it was proven in @xcite that the kerr - schild ansatz does not work in lovelock theory ( except for very special cases as einstein theory and chern - simons theory ) , and this manifestly shows how difficult this classical problem is .",
    "nevertheless , despite the difficulty , some advances in this area were recently achieved : in @xcite an exact analytic rotating solution was found for chern - simons gravity in five dimensions .",
    "this einstein - gauss - bonnet solution , however , does not present a horizon , and thus it does not represent a black hole .",
    "nevertheless , the numerical analysis of @xcite supports the idea that rotating solutions actually exist . besides , approximated analytic solutions at first order in the angular momentum parameter were found in @xcite .",
    "other solutions are known which represent rotating flat branes ; these are a simple extension of topological black holes with @xmath343 .    despite these recent advances ,",
    "the problem of finding an exact analytic rotating black hole solution in lovelock theory still remains an open problem .",
    "in this section , we will discuss other constructions which , locally , coincide with the deser - boulware spherically symmetry metric .",
    "the next class of solutions we would like to discuss is a class of vacuum solutions of lovelock theory which represents wormhole geometries that connect two disconnected asymptotic regions of the space - time .",
    "recently , several examples of such solutions were found @xcite , describing vacuum wormholes with different asymptotic behaviors , and in different number of dimensions .",
    "so , the first question we might ask is : why do wormholes exist in lovelock theory ?",
    "the main reason why vacuum wormholes exist in a theory like ( [ l ] ) is actually simple , and it can be heuristically explained as follows : consider the equations of motion corresponding to lagrangian ( [ l ] ) , which can be always written as@xmath344where the higher order terms act as an effective stress tensor that here we denoted @xmath345 . in the case of egb theory it",
    "reads@xmath346where , as usual , @xmath347 , @xmath348 .",
    "the key point is that this effective stress tensor @xmath349 , thought of as a kind of matter contribution , can be shown to violate the energy conditions for @xmath10 large enough .",
    "actually , this does not represent an actual problem from the conceptual point of view since this `` matter '' is actually made of pure gravity .",
    "however , a consequence of this violation of the energy conditions is that eqs .",
    "( [ eco ] )  allow the existence of vacuum wormhole solutions at scales of order @xmath324 , unlike the case of gr , where solutions of this sort require the consideration of _",
    "exotic matter_.    furthermore , there is a second reason for such curious solutions to exist in lovelock theory . as mentioned above ,",
    "when the coefficients @xmath117 in ( [ l ] ) correspond to the cs theory , the space of solutions experiments an unusual enhancement , which translates into a large degeneracy of the metric of spaces with enough symmetry . roughly speaking , for such particular cases ,",
    "lovelock theory is somehow degenerated enough to admit metric with very special properties , and wormholes are some of them .",
    "nevertheless , here we will focus our attention on wormhole solutions that exist in five - dimensional egb theory without requiring the coefficients @xmath350 and @xmath10 to be those that correspond to cs theory .",
    "therefore , the existence of such solutions , regarded as an anomaly , is ultimately attributed to the issue of the energy conditions mentioned above .",
    "the particular configurations we will consider are the so - called thin - shell wormholes , which correspond to connecting two regions of the space through a codimension - one hypersurface that plays the role of the wormhole throat .",
    "for such a geometry to be constructed , we have to make use of the junction conditions of the egb theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will consider the configuration of two boulware - deser spaces connected through a hypersurface on which the induced stress - tensor vanishes .",
    "such geometries are not possible in gr , where wormholes require the energy conditions to be violated on the thin - shell . however , in lovelock theory , and because of the higher order terms , spherically symmetric vacuum wormholes with positive mass can be constructed , as shown by gravanis and willison in @xcite .",
    "let us review the procedure here .",
    "let @xmath351 be a four - dimensional timelike orientable hypersurface of codimension one , whose normal vector is denoted by @xmath352 .",
    "suppose @xmath353 separates two regions of the space , which we call @xmath354 and @xmath355 .",
    "then , junction conditions read@xmath356where @xmath357 denotes the jump of the quantity @xmath358 across the hypersurface @xmath351 , which means @xmath359 , where the sign @xmath360 depends on the relative orientation of the regions . above",
    ", tensor @xmath361 represents the induced stress - tensor on the hypersurface @xmath351 , in complete analogy with the israel junction conditions in einstein theory . in fact",
    ", we see that the first two terms in ( [ jc ] ) actually correspond to the israel junction conditions constructed with the extrinsic curvature @xmath362 and its trace @xmath363 .",
    "in addition , the junction conditions corresponding to the egb theory contains contributions cubic in the extrinsic curvature,@xmath364and also contributions that involve the riemann curvature tensor of the hypersurface @xmath365    the notation used here is such that latin indices @xmath366 refer to coordinates on the four - dimensional hypersurface that separate the two five - dimensional regions of the space .",
    "the induced metric is denoted by @xmath367 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in ref .",
    "@xcite the junction conditions were studied in the most general case , including the case of space - like junctures , which corresponds to a cosmological - type geometries that experiment a change of behavior at a given time characterized by the hypersurface @xmath351 .",
    "it was pointed out by h. maeda that this kind of space - like junction conditions could be used to construct regular black hole solutions by means of geometric surgery procedure inside the black hole horizon .    here",
    "we will be mainly concerned with static spherically symmetric geometries , and , besides , with spherically symmetric boundary conditions .",
    "that is , we will consider the time - like hypersurface @xmath351 that separates the two regions of the space to be located at fixed radial coordinate @xmath368 , and the system of coordinates we will parameterize the three angular directions @xmath369 of the junction hypersurface , and the proper time @xmath370 of an observer on @xmath351 .",
    "then , we introduce the metrics @xmath371on each region @xmath354 and @xmath355 , and the two regions join at @xmath368 . since here we consider vacuum solutions , @xmath372 and @xmath372",
    "are given by ( [ siete ] ) ( or by ( [ sol ] ) in the case @xmath373 ) .",
    "in general , there is no reason for the mass parameters @xmath374 of the two regions to be equal , and the same happens with the choice of the branches @xmath375 .",
    "moreover , the orientation of @xmath376 and that of @xmath355 with respect to the normal vector @xmath377 are also independent one on each other , and we will take this degree of freedom into account by introducing the variables @xmath378 and @xmath379 which indicate whether in each region the radial coordinate @xmath380 is parallel ( @xmath381 ) or anti - parallel ( @xmath382 ) to @xmath352 .",
    "therefore , wormhole - like geometry corresponds to the orientation @xmath383 , while the standard shell - likegeometry corresponds to the case @xmath384 .",
    "the freedom in choosing the parameters @xmath142 , @xmath385 , @xmath90 independently in each region allows for a wide class of solutions .",
    "the whole catalog was recently studied in @xcite .",
    "the metric on @xmath351 induced from region @xmath354 is the same as the one induced from region @xmath355 , and is given by@xmath386where , according to ( [ siete ] ) , @xmath387 will be chosen to be the line element of a 3-manifold with ( intrinsic ) curvature @xmath388 , i.e. it is a unit sphere , a hyperboloid or flat space respectively .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath351 is the world - volume of the juncture where regions @xmath354 and @xmath355 join .",
    "to see whether such a wormhole - like ( or shell - like ) configuration is possible in vacuum , we have to solve junction conditions ( [ jc ] ) with @xmath389 .",
    "to do this we first need to compute the components of the intrinsic curvature .",
    "these are given by            from these equations we see that the radius of the throat of the wormhole is given by@xmath400and from this we can also calculate the mass of the wormhole easily . eq .",
    "( [ mmm ] ) implies that , in the case of the spherically symmetric wormhole ( @xmath401 ) , we need @xmath402 for the wormhole to exist .",
    "then , provided @xmath403 is of order one , the radius of the wormhole throat is or order @xmath404 . besides",
    ", we should ask the throat to be located outside the horizon , namely @xmath405 .",
    "it is remarkable that all these conditions can be satisfied @xcite for positive values of @xmath10 , @xmath406 , @xmath142 and @xmath122 .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that spherically symmetric wormhole solutions only exist if at least one of the two regions @xmath407 corresponds to the branch @xmath408 in ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "more remarkable is the fact that the analysis of the dynamic case @xmath409 follows straightforward .",
    "when @xmath410 , equations @xmath411 and @xmath412 are not linearly independent , and it is sufficient to solve the first of them . considering @xmath401 , we get@xmath413which has the form of a one - dimensional dynamic equation of motion constrained by the vanishing energy condition .",
    "notice that ( [ rr ] ) is recovered by demanding @xmath414 .",
    "notice also that the effective potential @xmath415 has negative derivative , and for large values of @xmath416 it goes like @xmath417 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath418 can be positive and of positive derivative for non - symmetric wormhole configurations .    summarizing",
    ", we have just seen that spherically symmetric ( microscopic ) thin - shell wormholes in vacuum are admitted as solutions of the five - dimensional lovelock theory .",
    "these solutions are allowed by additional terms arising in the junction conditions of the egb theory .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the one we discussed here is not the only class of wormhole - like solutions that exists in lovelock theory .",
    "for instance , in @xcite a static wormhole solution for gravity in vacuum was found for cs gravity in arbitrary ( odd ) dimensions @xmath419 .",
    "this wormhole connects two asymptotic regions whose respective boundaries are locally given by r @xmath420 @xmath421 h@xmath422 .    besides",
    ", @xmath38-dimensional static wormhole solutions of the egb theory were also studied in @xcite , and explicit wormhole solutions respecting the energy conditions in the whole spacetime were found for the case @xmath96 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of these solutions is given  by r @xmath420 h@xmath423 .      as we have seen in the previous sections ,",
    "there are many features of lovelock solutions that are not present in gr .",
    "eternal black holes and wormholes are remarkable examples .",
    "another example is the existence of positive mass solutions with naked singularities .",
    "in fact , naked singularities appear in all the catalog of solutions , for both spherically symmetric and extended objects , for both solutions with a suitable gr limit and solutions without it .",
    "but , what kind of naked singularities are these ?",
    "for instance , we could ask whether these are stable under gravitational perturbations @xcite ; or whether these turn out to be `` bad '' singularities when probed with wave functions @xcite .    regarding the question about the stability ,",
    "this issue was studied recently within the framework of the kodama - ishibashi formalism , and some evidence of instabilities was found @xcite . on the other hand , here we will address the second question , the one about how these naked singularities look like when analyzed with quantum probes . to do this we will employ the method developed by horowitz and marolf in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the pioneer work of wald @xcite .",
    "the basic idea es the following : unlike what happens in the classical regime , where a singular space is defined by the concept of geodesic incompleteness , in the quantum mechanical regime the singular character of the space - time is defined in terms of the ambiguity in the definition of the hamiltonian evolution of wave functions on it @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the singular nature of a given space is determined in terms of the ambiguity when trying to find a self - adjoint extension of the hamiltonian operator to the whole space .",
    "when such self - adjoint extension exists and is unique , then it is said that the space is quantum mechanically regular , in spite of the singularities it might present at classical level .",
    "notice that this is not matter of deforming the space or somehow resolving it , but it is rather a reconsideration of what is the relevant physical dynamics on it .",
    "in fact , a space can be classically singular but still regular when it is analyzed with quantum probes .    here",
    ", we will apply the concept of quantum probes to the singular solutions of lovelock theory discussed above .",
    "but , first , let us review the method developed in @xcite .",
    "consider the quantum dynamics of a scalar field @xmath424  on the spherically symmetric space ( [ intervalo ] ) , which is governed by the klein - gordon equation@xmath425this equation can be written as follows@xmath426where @xmath427 is the covariant derivative on the spacelike hypersurfaces defined by constant @xmath114 foliations , and where the metric function @xmath135 is given by ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "the piece @xmath428 in ( [ adove ] ) involves the laplacian operator on the unitary 3-sphere , whose eigenvalues are known to be given by @xmath429 with positive integers @xmath430    now , equation ( [ adove ] ) can be written in its schrdinger - like form , schematically , @xmath431and then the problem to deal with is to decide whether the hamiltonian operator @xmath432 admits a unique self - adjoint extension in spite of the fact the space is singular at the origin @xmath152 .",
    "as mentioned , in the quantum mechanical context the existence of singularity is associated to the non - existence of a unique self - adjoint extension of the hamiltonian operator rather than to a geodesical completeness .",
    "then , the problem of determining whether the space is regular is translated into the problem of verifying whether @xmath433 admits a unique self - adjoint extension @xmath434 .",
    "if such extended operator exists , then the hamiltonian evolution of the wave function in this space would be given by@xmath435and it would be well - defined .",
    "fails to be of finite norm near the origin for any value of @xmath438 and for any of the two possible signs @xmath360 in ( [ differential ] ) ; see horowitzmarolf for details .",
    "in other words , for the space to be considered regular quantum mechanically it is necessary to see that at least one solution @xmath15 to ( [ differential ] ) is non - normalizable around the origin .",
    "this criterion strongly depends on which norm @xmath439 is considered .",
    "the well - posedness of an initial value problem requires not only the existence and uniticity of conditions , but also continuous dependence of solutions on initial data .",
    "then , the norm @xmath439 to be considered should select a the function space that fulfills these requirements .",
    "a sensitive norm in this sense is the sobolev norm @xcite .    to see how the method works in the case we are interested in ,",
    "let us consider again the five - dimensional boulware - deser space ( [ intervalo])-([sol ] ) .",
    "the branch @xmath140 of this space presents a naked singularity for all positive values of @xmath142 , while the branch @xmath141 only presents naked singularities within the range @xmath174 .",
    "then , let us solve the wave equation for these spaces . to analyze the solutions of ( [ differential ] ) near the singular point @xmath152 it is convenient to write this equation as @xmath440 , with @xmath441 and @xmath442 being two functions analytic at the origin .",
    "this is a fuchsian equation and so it admits solutions with the form @xmath443 for certain analytic function @xmath444 and a complex number @xmath90 that is known to solve the indicial equation @xmath445 .",
    "then , replacing ( [ sol ] ) in ( [ differential ] ) we find @xmath446 , @xmath447 , and two independent solutions to ( [ differential ] ) are then given by the two values of @xmath90 that solve @xmath448 .",
    "therefore , we find that one of the solutions to ( [ differential ] ) always diverges at least as rapidly as @xmath449 , and so it fails to be integrable with respect to the sobolev norm .    summarizing , there exists a unique self - adjoint extension @xmath434 , from what we conclude that five - dimensional boulware - deser metric turns out to be regular when tested by quantum probes .",
    "it is remarkable that the positive ( but small ) mass solutions of five - dimensional black holes are in a sense regular quantum mechanically , despite the naked curvature singularity they exhibit at the origin .    before concluding , we wish to make a remark about the consistency of studying naked singularities in this way",
    "actually , one could wonder whether probing naked singularities in a theory with a finite higher curvature expansion makes sense or not .",
    "for instance , in string inspired models , as soon as one approaches the singularity , neglecting higher order corrections seems to be impossible since higher and higher order terms start to dominate as we go close enough to the singularity . however , let us argue here that , even though this is true , this is not necessarily an obstruction for testing singularities with quantum probes up to certain order in the higher curvature expansion .",
    "let us be reminded of what we do when we solve the schrdinger equation for the coulombian potential ( e.g. in fact , the analogy with the hydrogen atom in quantum mechanics is quite good since such problem also corresponds to solving a wave function equation in presence of a central potential whose classical counterpart breaks down at the origin ) . in quantum mechanics , even though the coulombian potential diverges at the origin , we know that the quantum problem still makes sense , and we do solve the wave equation without complaining about the fact that other corrections to the potential ( e.g. effective screening due to quantum effects , or short distance corrections to the coulombian potential ) could in principle appear at very short distances .",
    "heuristically speaking , what one really has to do to make sure the whole procedure makes sense is comparing the typical size of the wave packet with the length scale where the terms that were neglected would dominate .",
    "for example , above we were dealing with the egb action , and the terms @xmath450 were certainly neglected , and so the analysis carried out could still make sense as long as the compton length of the wave packet is small enough in comparison with the length scale imposed by the coupling constant @xmath342 with @xmath180 , and provided the fact higher curvature terms act as a perturbation .    for some particular models where the couplings @xmath117 are given in terms of the same fundamental scale ( like the models inspired in string theory where the scale is given by @xmath451 )",
    "the story could be a little more subtle , and so the argument above would not be valid in general .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely the case that higher order terms would contribute by smoothing out the singularity even more , although not necessarily resolving it in a classical sense .",
