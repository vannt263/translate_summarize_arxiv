    "a comment by markenscoff@xcite [ hereafter referred to as ( m ) ] criticizes several aspects of my paper@xcite [ referred to as ( p ) ] on the derivation of dynamic extensions to the static peierls - nabarro equations .",
    "one remark@xcite concerns my account of the author s work in the concluding section of ( p ) .",
    "admittedly , the expression `` extremely singular '' i employ there is improper , for it might be interpreted as a statement that the problem involves strong _ non - regularizable _ singularities , which it does not . to address the remaining points ,",
    "i refer to eshelby s seminal paper@xcite on dynamic dislocation motion by ( e ) , and use equation numbers preceded by ` p ' , ` m ' of ` e ' to refer to equations in ( p ) , ( m ) , or ( e ) . unless otherwise stated , other equation numbers relate to equations in the present reply .",
    "ref .  ( p ) focuses on obtaining dynamic equations of the peierls - nabarro ( pn ) type ( to be solved numerically ) to determine the time - varying slip @xmath0 on the slip plane @xmath1 of a planar dislocation with extended core , subjected to an arbitrary time - dependent loading .",
    "the periodic pull - back force is arbitrary as well .",
    "accordingly , no assumption on the slip function must be made except smoothness . in this context",
    "i claim in ( p ) is that eshelby s dynamic pn equation for screws ( e21 ) misses the term ( proportional to ) @xmath2 featured by ( p35 ) .",
    "this is seen most directly from appendix c1 of ( p ) , in which what i call ( after rosakis@xcite ) `` weertman s equation '' , namely , the constant - velocity limit ( p45 ) of the dynamic pn equation in the co - moving frame , is easily retrieved from ( p35 ) .",
    "this can not be done with ( e21 ) , because the term @xmath2 proves essential in the process.@xcite whereas the kernel @xmath3 represents the part of the cylindrical stress waves generated by the dislocation , that sweeps the slip plane , @xmath2 accounts for outward emission of updating waves collected at their incipience .",
    "on the basis of its negative sign@xcite it can be interpreted ( superficially , at least ) as a radiative loss term .",
    "however , as shown below in section [ sec : dirac ] , its operative role is to prevent a spurious stress term to show up at the dislocation core .",
    "although claiming in ( m ) that ( e21 ) is correct , markenscoff offers no convincing supporting argument . the self - force used by alshitz et al . , namely ( e28 ) ,",
    "is derived by eshelby from ( e26 ) as part of the equation of motion ( eom ) that governs the time evolution of the dislocation position .",
    "this eom assumes an arctangent slip function .",
    "eshelby does _ not _ derive ( e26 ) from ( e21 ) . since ( p ) does not address eom issues ( dealt with elsewhere@xcite ) but a more general question , the paper by alshitz et al .",
    "put forward in ( m ) is irrelevant here .",
    "it should be noted , however , that ( e26 ) _ can _ be obtained from ( p35).@xcite moreover in retrieving,@xcite by assuming an arctangent slip function , the specific _ solution _ to weertman s equation that corresponds to a sine pull - back force rather than the latter general equation _ per se _ , contrary to what ( m ) states markenscoff appeals to non - zero @xmath4 values.@xcite this is not allowed in the context of ( e21 ) , so that this calculation is inconclusive with regard to the latter equation .",
    "prior to ( p ) , dewit@xcite emphasized that the multivalued character of static displacements associated to individual dislocations can be disambiguated by adding a distribution@xcite ( or `` generalized function''@xcite ) part located on a volterra cut . whereas using a single- or a multi - valued displacement field can be seen in statics as a matter of choice,@xcite made possible by an underlying gauge - invariant structure,@xcite a single - valued treatment such as",
    "that used in ( p ) is perhaps more natural in dynamics .",
    "indeed , it is unclear how to extend to dynamics the physical arguments that have been put forward in statics to justify , in connection with mutivaluedness , the arbitrariness of this discontinuity surface.@xcite also , the surface spanned by a moving individual dislocation line , identified in ( p ) with the cut , becomes in dynamics a physical observable related to the knowledge of past trajectory .",
    "the latter is inherent to dynamics since past motion is used to compute retarded fields .",
    "obviously , the necessary term @xmath2 is linked to this choice of jumping plane .",
    "the question of whether the cut might , after all , be arbitrary in a dynamic theory of dislocation _ lines _ should be examined carefully , perhaps in the light of gauge - related considerations.@xcite fig .  1 in ( m )",
    "suggests such an arbitrariness , but it is noted that the result it relates to concerns the _ short - time _ response of a _ volterra _ dislocation . at any rate ,",
    "the choice made in ( p ) is appropriate@xcite to extended planar ( i.e. , somigliana ) dislocations such as in the pn equation .",
    "inasmuch as one adopts mura s eigenstrains approach@xcite as in ( p ) the cut constitutes the support of the plastic eigenstrains , which must be properly accounted for when computing fields on the slip plane.@xcite distribution theory can then be appealed to in order to make calculations without the need for a limiting process across the surface of discontinuity.@xcite in ( p ) in particular , fourier transforms ( ft ) are always implicitly interpreted as generalized functions .",
    "two writings of the displacement @xmath5 generated by an eigendistortion @xmath6 , representing an inclusion embedded in a host medium of infinite extent , are possible . to follow ( m ) , we call them the `` inclusion '' and `` dislocation '' representations . in a plane problem",
    "these are , with @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 in which @xmath12 is the green s function , @xmath13 is the tensor of elastic moduli , and where integration over @xmath14 is on infinite space .",
    "their eventual reduction to `` surface '' integrals depends on the precise form of @xmath6 . as far as @xmath14 is concerned and if @xmath6 is bounded by some constant , @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand as mere parameters , and boundary contributions at infinity can be ignored .",
    "equation ( m8 ) is obtained from ( [ eq : udisl ] ) by mura@xcite ( see p.  351 ) .",
    "expressions ( [ eq : uincl ] ) and ( [ eq : udisl ] ) differ only by a partial integration with respect to @xmath14 , which makes them formally equivalent .",
    "a ft makes this obvious:@xcite @xmath17 and the factor @xmath18 can be interpreted as a derivative pertaining either to @xmath12 or to @xmath19 .",
    "calculations have been done in ( p ) using ( [ eq : ufour ] ) , but it is instructive to compute @xmath20 in direct space with ( [ eq : uincl ] ) and ( [ eq : udisl ] ) .",
    "all formulations are found _ equivalent in the transient regime _ contrary to what the first paragraph of ( m ) suggests . to show this ,",
    "consider a time - varying eigendistortion localized on a surface s of normal @xmath21 by means of a surface distribution @xmath22 , suitable to represent dislocations.@xcite specifically , @xmath23 , in which @xmath24 is the local burgers vector .",
    "then , in the `` inclusion '' formulation the source term is the sum of one single- and one double - layer : @xmath25 for a volterra screw of slip plane @xmath1 one has @xmath26 in which @xmath27 is heaviside s function .",
    "the part of @xmath22 is played by @xmath28 , and that of @xmath29 by @xmath30 . thus @xmath31.\\ ] ] for a screw in isotropic elasticity the single - layer contribution vanishes ( @xmath32 is the shear modulus ) : @xmath33 . focusing on the elementary time - dependent solution ( p28 ) , which lies at the root of the derivation of the term @xmath2 in ( p35 ) , requires taking @xmath34 .",
    "the distributional derivative in @xmath35 then entails @xmath36 on the other hand , the `` dislocation '' formalism directly yields @xmath37 whereas in the `` dislocation '' formulation , by definition , the derivative @xmath38 takes place inside the integral over @xmath39 , an ambiguity might subsist in the `` inclusion '' formulation , because whether the result should involve @xmath40 , or @xmath41 , or either indifferently , depends on whether the integrals over @xmath39 and @xmath42 in ( [ eq : uincl2 ] ) can be harmlessly interchanged or not . in writing the final expression of ( [ eq : uincl2 ] )",
    "it has been arbitrarily assumed that the integral over @xmath39 was done first . simplifying the writing of the integrals in the right - hand sides ( rhs ) of ( [ eq : uincl2 ] ) and ( [ eq : udisl2 ] ) by an obvious change of variables in @xmath39 , and introducing @xmath43 the proof of the equivalence",
    "consists in showing that @xmath44 where , with @xmath45 , the green s function reads@xcite ( @xmath46 is the shear wave velocity ) @xmath47 in this writing , the generalized function @xmath48 if @xmath49 , and @xmath50 otherwise , has been introduced to denote what can be written @xmath51 .",
    "then , for @xmath52 , @xmath53,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 stands for the characteristic function of the spatio - temporal domain @xmath55 delimited by the simultaneous constraints @xmath56 , equal to @xmath57 in @xmath55 and to @xmath50 elsewhere .",
    "the function @xmath58 is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] at @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) .",
    "the plateau is supported by domain @xmath55 . on the circle @xmath62",
    ", @xmath63 is equal to @xmath64 and connects continuously to the plateau on the left semi - circle ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "discontinuities are present along the @xmath66 axis at @xmath67 for @xmath68 , and along the @xmath69 axis at @xmath68 for @xmath65 .",
    "the latter are responsible for the dirac term @xmath70 in ( p28 ) , this equation being retrieved from taking the @xmath4-derivative of the above expression of @xmath58 .",
    "the above shows that the dirac sheets at @xmath71 arise for @xmath65 as the envelope of circular waves emitted at each point of the perturbed region @xmath72 .",
    "function @xmath63 at @xmath59.,width=188 ]    turning now to the `` dislocation '' formulation , one has@xcite @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) in the sense of generalized functions , or more formally@xcite @xmath75 with pf denoting hadamard s finite part , in the sense of distributions ( which requires using test functions ) .",
    "then , for @xmath52 , @xmath76 the integral in ( [ eq : fp32 ] ) can be computed conveniently without appealing to test functions , by using a representation of the generalized function similar to those found in ref .",
    "@xmath77^{-3/2}.\\ ] ] in the limit , the real part operator @xmath78 sets the rhs .  to zero for @xmath79 , as must be .",
    "carrying out the integral yields , for any nonzero real constant @xmath80 , @xmath81^{3/2}}=-\\frac{1}{a}\\left[\\frac{x+{\\mathrm{i}}\\epsilon}{\\sqrt{a-(x+{\\mathrm{i}}\\epsilon)^2 } } -{\\mathrm{i}}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : epsfinite } & & { } + \\theta(-x)\\theta(-a-\\epsilon^2)\\frac{2\\epsilon}{a\\sqrt{|a|-\\epsilon^2}}\\qquad ( \\epsilon>0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we remark that integral @xmath82 is not defined for @xmath65 and @xmath83 since in this case the integrand blows up as @xmath84 near the origin .",
    "moreover , @xmath85 is , for @xmath86 , a discontinuous function of @xmath87 at @xmath67 because of the cut in the principal determination of the square root .",
    "equation ( [ eq : epsfinite ] ) can be verified by taking derivatives with respect to @xmath87 of both sides : then , the dirac term created by the latter discontinuity and that coming from the rightmost term cancel out mutually in the rhs . owing to the delta - sequence @xmath88 one finds @xmath89 . using this result in ( [ eq : fp32 ] ) with @xmath90 , shows that @xmath20 in the dislocation formulation ( [ eq : udisl2 ] ) again yields ( p28 ) .",
    "thus , this alternative derivation produces the same result , which illustrates the consistency of the approach .",
    "turning now to ( p49),@xcite markenscoff s objections against the dirac term @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the dislocation position , misunderstand its nature and working . in the formulation of ( p49 ) ,",
    "mathematically correct in the sense of generalized functions although perhaps inconvenient for numerical calculations , the dirac term ( which comes out of @xmath2 ) compensates for the singularity as @xmath93 and makes the result finite in the subsonic regime .",
    "it serves the same purpose as the subtraction and addition of a compensating term in ( m9 ) .",
    "a notable difference is that it arises here as a direct consequence of the formalism employed.@xcite regularizing devices are not unique , and ( m9 ) is by no means the sole manner of writing the elastic strain . in ( p49 ) , the current instant @xmath94 should be approached in the integral by a limiting process , for instance by multiplying the integrand by @xmath95 and letting @xmath96 .",
    "this is related to the equal - time value of the green s function @xmath97 being defined only as a limit@xcite @xmath98 ( instead , considering the out - of - plane stress at small @xmath99 would induce a natural time cut - off of the corresponding integral of order @xmath100 ) . with this precaution",
    "one can , e.g. , deduce from ( p49 ) the stress on the slip plane generated by a volterra screw that at @xmath101 jumps from rest to a constant velocity @xmath102 , a prototypical instationary case .",
    "the result reads@xcite @xmath103\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\pi\\mathop{\\text{sign}}(v)[(v/{c_\\text{s}})^2 - 1]^{1/2}_+\\delta(x - vt).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is _ no _ dirac term at the dislocation position in the subsonic regime @xmath104 , as must be .",
    "the above - discussed compensation has occurred in the course of the derivation.@xcite again , the criticism in ( m ) is unjustified . had the term",
    "@xmath2 not been present in ( p35 ) , and consequently no dirac term featured by ( p49 ) , a spurious stress contribution @xmath105 would have remained in ( [ eq : voltjump ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that ( [ eq : voltjump ] ) embodies a former result for the subsonic regime by markenscoff@xcite [ equ .",
    "( 17 ) in that reference ] which it almost matches , and one for the supersonic regime by callias and markenscoff@xcite [ equ .",
    "( 2 ) at @xmath106 in that reference ] .",
    "i write `` almost '' because the calculation@xcite from ( p49 ) to ( [ eq : voltjump ] ) _ automatically _ provides the principal value prescription @xmath107 in the first bracketed term of ( [ eq : voltjump ] ) , which is absent from markenscoff s subsonic expression.@xcite this prescription regularizes the vicinity of the dislocation position @xmath108 .",
    "it makes the elementary stress @xmath109 a well - defined generalized function suitable to convolution with a smooth core shape function ( remark that @xmath109 is regular at @xmath67 for @xmath110 ) , as in statics ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that the volterra stress kernel in the static pn equation is proportional to @xmath112 , and not to @xmath113 ( or @xmath114 ) as stated in ( m ) .",
    "this leads us to equation ( m11 ) .",
    "it originates from the strain of a volterra screw moving at velocity @xmath102 being pretended not integrable at @xmath108.@xcite _ this can not be _ , owing to the principal value prescription that should be there ( see previous section ) , and ( m11 ) should be an equality , rather than a non - equality , as physics commands ( otherwise , even weertman s stationary pn equation would be meaningless ) . to illustrate this point",

    "this sum of terms stands for @xmath121(x)$].@xcite this illustrates the fact that in general , and contrary to what ( m11 ) states , the slip - plane limit can be interchanged with the convolution of a volterra solution by a smooth core function , provided the volterra solution is interpreted as a generalized function as in ( p ) , in ref .  , and above .",
