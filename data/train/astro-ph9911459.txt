    "the fir seds of galaxies provide insight into the energetic processes taking place in the sources .",
    "emission beyond a few @xmath0 m from quiescent or star - forming galaxies is dominated by dust re - radiating the stellar energy absorbed at uv  optical wavelengths .",
    "thus , the description of the radiative processes in the fir regime needs to account for both the dust composition and the nature of the heating sources .",
    "although dust emission is a complex process involving a continuum of values for the properties of the dust grains , a simple two ( or three ) components dust model has proven successful at describing the basic characteristics of the uv  optical extinction and the fir emission of the dust in our own and similar galaxies ( andriesse 1978 , draine & anderson 1985 , cox , krgel & mezger 1986 , mathis & whiffen 1989 , puget & lger 1989 , desrt , boulanger & puget 1990 , helou , ryter & soifer 1991 , rowan - robinson 1992 ) .",
    "one component , sometimes split into two ( desrt et al .",
    "1990 ) , consists of very small grains and large molecules ( size@xmath5100   ) which account for characteristics of the mid - ir emission , at @xmath64050@xmath0 m .",
    "this component is heated by the single - photon absorption process to temperatures of a few hundreds kelvin , up to @xmath21000  k , and is not in thermal equilibrium with its environment ( sellgren 1984 ; draine & anderson 1985 ) .",
    "the second component is formed by `` large '' grains ( size@xmath7100   ) in thermal equilibrium with their environment .",
    "these large dust grains account for practically all the emission longward of 80100  @xmath0 m in galaxies .",
    "their fir emission can be modelled as the superposition of multiple modified planck functions covering a range of temperatures and modulated by the grains emissivity e(@xmath8)@xmath9 , with 1@xmath102 ( e.g. seki & yamamoto 1980 , mezger , mathis & panagia 1982 , hildebrand 1983 , andriesse 1974 , bianchi , davies & alton 1999 ) .",
    "the color temperatures of the large dust grains depend on both the energy density per unit volume and the hardness of the stellar radiation field . as a first approximation , the galaxy fir emission longward of 4050  @xmath0",
    "m has been ascribed to dust heated by massive , ionizing stars ( warm dust ) if the color temperature is of the order of 3070  k and to dust heated by non - ionizing stars ( cool dust ) if the temperatures are @xmath51530  k ( e.g. , helou 1986 , chini , krgel & kreysa 1986a , lonsdale - persson & helou 1987 , rowan - robinson & crawford 1989 , rowan - robinson & efstathiou 1993 ) .",
    "the radiation field created by the diffuse non - ionizing population of a galaxy is generally referred to as the interstellar radiation field ( isrf , e.g. , boulanger et al .",
    "massive stars can also heat the dust to color temperatures t@xmath470  k ; this hot dust contributes , together with the small , non - equilibrium grains mainly to the mid - ir emission shortward of @xmath240  @xmath0 m , typically with decreasing filling factor for increasing temperature ( e.g. , natta & panagia 1976 ) .",
    "the intensity of the dust emission at @xmath1110  @xmath0 m has been observed to decrease for increasing star - formation activity in a galaxy ( helou 1986 ) ; this has been interpreted as the destruction of large molecules / very small grains by hard radiation from massive stars ( boulanger et al . 1988 ) . throughout",
    "the paper , ` thermal fir emission ' refers to the emission in the wavelength range 11000  @xmath0 m from large dust grains with equilibrium temperatures t@xmath56070  k. ` total fir emission ' defines the integrated dust emission from both small and large grains , also in the range 1  @xmath0 m to 1000  @xmath0 m .",
    "the largest database of fir data of galaxies available to date is from the iras survey ( e.g. , soifer et al . 1989 ) .",
    "because the wavelength coverage is 8120  @xmath0 m , iras observations alone are not adequate for characterizing the emission from dust cooler than t@xmath1230  k. however , cool dust has been shown to be a major contributor to the total dust mass content of a galaxy ( e.g. , kwan & xie 1992 , xu & helou 1986 ) and to contribute to the opacity budget .",
    "in relatively recent years , observations at mm and sub - mm wavelengths have been used to complement iras data , to address the issue of the cool dust content of galaxies ( e.g. , chini et al .",
    "1986b , kwan & xie 1992 , roche & chandler 1993 , sievers et al .",
    "1994 , rigopoulou , lawrence & rowan - robinson 1996 , andreani & franceschini 1996 , to quote a few ) .",
    "one of the drawbacks of mm observations is the potential presence of contamination from thermal and non - thermal radio emission ( e.g. , roche & chandler 1993 ) . less sensitive to this problem , but still effective at characterizing dust emission down to temperatures of @xmath515  k ,",
    "are observations obtained with the iso satellite , which covered the fir wavelength range up to @xmath2240  @xmath0 m .",
    "iso data have shown that the fir emission of late type galaxies receives a substantial contribution from cool dust ( t@xmath21020  k , krgel et al .",

    "1998 , davies et al . 1999 ) .",
    "cool dust is also present in elliptical galaxies ( haas 1998 ) , complementing the iras detections of relatively warm dust , t@xmath22530  k , in these objects ( e.g. , goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ) .",
    "conversely , the iso emission of luminous and ultraluminous fir galaxies , like arp244 , ngc6240 , arp220 , and m82 , are fit by a modified planck function with color temperature @xmath23050  k , for emissivity index @xmath13=1 ( klaas et al .",

    "are similar to those of the central regions of local starburst galaxies .",
    "such characteristics include the star formation rates per unit area , the shape of the stellar continuum and the intensity and shape of the absorption features in the restframe uv spectra , and the ionizing / uv - continuum photon ratios ( steidel et al .",

    "the necessity to link the two populations of high - redshift galaxies , uv - bright and fir - bright , has clearly brought new urgency to the problem of understanding the opacity and dust emission characteristics of star - forming galaxies at all redshifts .",
    "this paper presents iso photometric observations of eight nearby star - forming galaxies in the wavelength range 120240  @xmath0 m , in order to study the galaxies dust content in a wavelength range which is beyond the limits of iras . for five of the galaxies ,",
    "the balance between the uv  optical  nearir stellar energy absorbed by the dust and the fir energy emitted by dust is investigated in detail .",
    "the results from our small sample will be placed in the more general context of dust opacity in star - forming galaxies at low and high redshift .",
    "the original sample of 40 star - forming galaxies from which our iso sources were selected was derived from the iue atlas by kinney et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , with the following characteristics : the galaxies are uv - bright and have star formation rates ( sfrs ) of a few up to a few tens m@xmath14  yr@xmath15 ; for each galaxy , we have uv , optical and , in some cases , near - ir seds obtained from large - aperture spectroscopy ( calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann 1994 , mcquade , calzetti & kinney 1995 , storchi - bergmann , kinney & challis 1995 , calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann 1996 ) ; the dust reddening properties of these galaxies in the wavelength range 0.122.2  @xmath0 m are well characterized ( calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann 1994 , calzetti 1997a ) . from this original sample , we selected a subsample of 16 objects with positive iras detections at 60  @xmath0 m and with more than 50% of both the blue light and the h@xmath16 emission included within the aperture of the uv  optical observations .",
    "the last requirement minimizes aperture mismatches between the short ( uv , optical and near - ir ) and long ( fir ) wavelength observations .",
    "visibility constraints and observing time limitations reduced the final number of targets to the eight listed in table  1 .",
    "the eight objects have redshifts z@xmath170.03 , metallicities in the range 0.12  z@xmath14 , intrinsic color excess in the range e(b@xmath18v)=00.7  mag , and sfrs in the range 0.255  m@xmath14  yr@xmath15 , as derived from the h@xmath16 emission for a 0.1100  m@xmath14 salpeter imf .",
    "the galaxies are non interacting , although some display double luminous peaks in their nuclei , perhaps a sign that they are caught at some stage of a merging process .",
    "for all eight objects , between 82% and 96% of the h@xmath16 emission is contained within the uv  optical observational aperture , and , for seven of them , more than 80% of the b band emission is included in the aperture ; for ngc7673 , the b band fraction in the aperture is 50% .",

    "the two off - source exposures were always taken before the on - source exposure , to avoid transients .",
    "typical exposure times ranged between 32  s and 128  s.    the data reduction and calibration were performed with the pia package at the infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac ) , following the standard procedure for point sources .",

    "the dust temperature decreases for increasing distance of the dust grains from the heating source , for increasing dust column density ( optical depth ) , and for increasing mean wavelength of the source sed ( panagia 1978 ) .",
    "because of the exponential dependence of @xmath68 on the medium s optical depth , large dust opacities reduce the temperature even in the presence of hard radiation from massive stars .",

    "effects of dust optical depth explain qualitatively why tol1924@xmath18416 does not have a cool dust component and its dust is generally warm , with t@xmath250  k. tol1924@xmath18416 is the most metal - poor and dust - poor galaxy in our sample of five , with a metallicity about 510 times lower than the other four and a very small optical dust reddening ( column  5 of table  1 ) . comparably low dust opacities are expected if the gas column densities are similar among the five galaxies .",
    "dust self - shielding is less effective in tol1924@xmath18416 than in the other galaxies , and the radiation from the massive stars will heat the dust to relatively high temperatures in the entire starburst region .",
    "optically thick regions are not the only cause for the presence of a cool dust component ; the non - ionizing stars produced in the central star - forming region can also heat the dust to relatively low color temperatures , similar in effect to the isrf . for typical star - formation durations of @xmath250100  myr or more ,",
    "a number of long - living , non - ionizing stars are accumulated in the starburst site and become important for the dust heating .",
    "photons from these stars are less energetic on average than the radiation from massive stars and can also travel long distances before being intercepted by a dust grain ( mezger et al .",
    "the dust is then heated to relatively low color temperatures ( e.g. , the case of the postburst galaxy ngc4945 , koornneef 1993 ) . for the typical sfrs of ngc7673 , ngc5860 , and ic1586 ( table  1 ) , the energy density of the starburst s non - ionizing stars equals that of the host galaxy diffuse radiation field at a distance about 0.6  times the radius of the galaxy from the starburst center , in the assumption that the host galaxy has stellar population characteristics similar to the milky way . since @xmath69 , a factor of a few variation in the energy density @xmath70 produces only a few percent change in the dust temperature @xmath68 .",
    "our galaxies are generally classified as ` uv - bright ' .",
    "however , with the exception of tol1924@xmath18416 which contains relatively little dust , all the others are affected by dust obscuration in a non - negligible manner .",

    "the apparent contradiction that such galaxies are at the same time ` uv - bright ' and good fir emitters : most of the uv - to - nearir emission will emerge from dust - clear lines of sight , while the fir emission emerges from dusty lines of sight ( calzetti 1997a , gordon , calzetti & witt 1997 ) .",

    "detailed energy balance analysis should be performed on the dust - poor galaxies in order to understand whether the observed underestimate of the opacity is an actual problem or is an artifact of how a(0.16 ) is constructed .",
    "second , very blue , dust - poor galaxies are generally associated with shorter timescales for star formation ( e.g. , calzetti 1997a ) , implying that , in equation  9 , @xmath77 should be changed from @xmath182.1 to a more negative value to properly represent the data points at @xmath791.4 .",

    "the possible youth of the stellar populations in the lyman - break galaxies ( ages @xmath512  gyr ) may also argue in favor of warm dust .",
    "in conclusion , the dust in high - redshift galaxies may be warmer than in ngc6090-like and ngc7673-like starbursts and , potentially , as warm as in tol1924@xmath18416 , implying that the distant galaxies would be undetectable with current sub - mm instrumentation .",
    "the long - wavelength coverage afforded by iso has been crucial for characterizing the thermal fir emission of actively star  forming galaxies .",
    "we observed with isophot eight starburst galaxies at both 150  @xmath0 m and 205  @xmath0 m and detected five in both bands . in two of the detected objects , ngc5860 and tol1924@xmath18416 , the best fit to the iras@xmath27iso dust emission in the wavelength range @xmath240240",
    "@xmath0 m is given by a single temperature value with dust emissivity index @xmath13=2 .",
    "the dust is warm in both galaxies , t@xmath232  k in ngc5860 and t@xmath250  k in tol1924@xmath18416 , but the presence of cold dust with t@xmath515  k can not be excluded in either case . in the other three objects ( ngc6090 , ngc7673 , ic1586 ) ,",
    "the best fit to the thermal dust emission is given by two modified planck functions with temperature t@xmath924055  k for the warm dust component and t@xmath932023  k for the cool dust component , both with dust emissivity index @xmath13=2 .",
    "the warm dust , heated by the ionizing stars produced in the starburst , contributes between 40% and 70% of the thermal fir emission ( e.g. , chini et al .",
    "1986a , lonsdale - persson & helou 1987 , young et al .",
    "the rest of the fir emission is due to the cool dust , which has an associated mass around 10@xmath3410@xmath35  m@xmath14 , i.e. , between 40 and 150 times the warm dust mass .",
    "the resulting gas - to - dust ratio values are compatible , within a factor @xmath122 with the milky way average ( sodroski et al . 1997 ) once variations in metallicity are taken into account .",
    "the contribution of the cool dust component is , therefore , not negligible even in ` warm ' systems such as starburst galaxies , although its importance varies by many factors from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the heating of a fraction of the cool dust component is from the starburst , as the isrf alone is not sufficient to account for the fir flux associated with the cool dust .",
    "large dust column densities and non - ionizing photons from the ageing stars are the most likely causes for cool dust associated with the starburst ( e.g. , lisenfeld et al .",
    "1999 ) .    around 70% of the bolometric energy is emitted in the fir , even if the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ` uv - bright ' .",
    "moreover , the uv emission below 0.2  @xmath0 m represents less than 15% of the fir emission ( with the exception of tol1924@xmath18416 ) .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the amount of stellar light absorbed by dust at uv - to - nearir wavelengths as predicted by the starburst obscuration curve of calzetti et al .",
    "( 1994 , calzetti 1997a ) .",
    "the starburst obscuration curve , applied to seds of star  forming galaxies with a zero - point r@xmath944.05 , reproduces the observed fir emission within a factor 2 for individual objects and within @xmath220% when averaged over large galaxy samples .",
    "the improvement in accuracy is due to the averaging of stellar populations and dust geometry variations in large samples .",
    "the variety of fir seds observed in our sample of local galaxies has direct implications for the detectability of uv - bright , high - redshift galaxies at fir restframe wavelengths .",
    "if the bolometric luminosities of lyman - break galaxies are around or above @xmath23@xmath8710@xmath88  l@xmath14 _ and _ their fir seds resemble that of ngc6090 , they would be detectable with current sub - mm instrumentation , as the predicted flux at 850  @xmath0 m ( observer s frame ) is around or greater than 4.4  mjy .",
    "however , if the dominant fir sed in high - redshift galaxies is like tol1924@xmath18416 , these galaxies will be undetected with the current scuba sensitivity limits , no matter how bright the objects intrinsically are .",
    "similar considerations hold for galaxies at z@xmath21 .",
    "there are reasons to believe that dust in z@xmath23 galaxies may be hotter than in galaxies at lower redshifts .",
    "star formation is intense and widespread over the entire galaxy in the high - redshift systems ( giavalisco et al .",
    "1996 , 1999 ) , thus increasing the number of ionizing photons available per dust grain .",
    "in addition , z@xmath23 galaxies could be fairly unevolved objects , possibly implying little contribution from aged stellar populations to the dust heating .",
    "both effects would combine to make high - redshift ( z@xmath43 ) galaxies relatively ` hot ' fir emitters .",
    "information on the fir emission of the lyman - break galaxies has been recently collected ( chapman et al .",
    "1999 ) , but very little or only partial data on the long - wavelength seds of these objects or of the scuba sources is currently available ( e.g. , lilly et al .",
    "1999 , smail et al . 1999 , and references therein ) . measuring dust seds is necessary to determine the dust content and emission characteristics of galaxies at high redshift and the relationship between the lyman - break galaxies and the scuba sources . in the low redshift universe ,",
    "iso has only started to unveil the full extent of the parameter space ( e.g. , range of temperatures , masses , spatial distribution of the different dust components , dependence on metallicity , starburst / host ratio , etc . ) of the dust fir emission in galaxies .",
    "future fir missions , such as sirtf , together with sub - mm wavelength observations will be instrumental for investigating the dust content of local galaxies in statistically meaningful samples .",
    "the authors thank rosemary wyse for many useful discussions and comments in different parts and at various stages of this work .",
    "thanks nino panagia for discussions on the fir opacity mechanisms in our galaxy and for a critical reading of the manuscript .",
