    "magnetic anisotropy induced by spin - orbit coupling and jahn - teller distortion plays a crucial role .    within a magnetic molecule or system ,",
    "it is difficult to switch the _ type _ of magnetic anisotropy ( i.e. , easy axis or easy plane ) or the _ sign _ of the magnetic anisotropy parameter with oxidation state or via charge transfer ( from a non - magnetic substrate ) because the anisotropy type is often determined by the shape or orientation of the molecule . instead",
    ", the magnitude of the magnetic anisotropy parameter or the type of magnetic ordering can be relatively easily varied @xcite .",
    "a change in oxidation state or charge transfer rarely alters orbital character critical to the anisotropy @xcite . however , there are some exceptional cases @xcite .",
    "first - principles - based calculations revealed that an eu - sandwiched triple - decker molecule , eu@xmath0(cot)@xmath2 ( cot@xmath6c@xmath1h@xmath1 ) , switches its magnetization direction from in - plane ( @xmath7 plane ) to out - of - plane ( along the @xmath8 axis ) when it is charged @xcite [ fig .",
    "[ fig : geo](a)-(c ) ] . fe - based molecules ( on copper ) @xcite and cobalt films @xcite were shown to change their magnetization directions from in - plane to out - of - plane by oxygen adsorption onto the molecules and by coating the films with graphene , respectively .    in this work we present a new mechanism for a spin blockade effect associated with a change in the _ type _ of magnetic anisotropy or in the _ sign _ of the magnetic anisotropy parameter in a single molecule transistor , by taking an example of a single eu@xmath0(cot)@xmath2 molecule weakly coupled to non - magnetic electrodes .",
    "eu@xmath9(cot)@xmath10 clusters ( @xmath11 ) have been synthesized and their magnetic properties have been characterized @xcite .",
    "similar lanthanide - based anisotropic molecules , [ ln@xmath12(cot@xmath13)@xmath10 ] , were synthesized in crystal phases and they were also formed in solutions @xcite . by solving the master equation , we find that electron transport via the molecule shows coulomb blockade - like behavior with one unique feature : current is highly suppressed at low bias independently of gate voltage .",
    "this suppression is caused by the interplay between spin selection rules and the sign reversal of the magnetic anisotropy parameter .",
    "the lowest magnetic levels in successive charge states differ by greater than 1/2 , @xmath3 , although the total spins differ by 1/2 , due to the sign change in the magnetic anisotropy parameter [ fig .",

    "this spin blockade effect can be lifted by significant @xmath5 field , and the threshold @xmath5 field depends on the field direction and the magnetic anisotropy parameter .             to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this kind of a spin blockade effect has not been studied before and it is distinct from other ( spin ) blockade effects . a spin blockade effect was reported in quantum dots when the total spins of successive charge states differ by greater than 1/2 ( @xmath15 ) due to the spin selection rules @xcite [ fig .",

    "the blockade effect observed in ref . arises from low - lying spin multiplets .",
    "our concept and results are quite general and so they can be applied to any anisotropic molecules in which the type of magnetic anisotropy can be switched over oxidation state or charge transfer . the spin blockade effect we report may shed light on controlling the magnetization direction by non - spin - polarized current without @xmath5 field , as well as on exploring effects of this unique property coupled to other molecular degrees of freedom on electron and thermal transport .",
    "in our model , we assume that an individual eu@xmath0(cot)@xmath2 molecule is bridged between non - magnetic metallic electrodes without linker groups ( i.e. , no chemical bonding ) and that the molecule can be in a cationic ( @xmath16 ) or neutral ( @xmath17 ) state by varying gate voltage @xmath18 .",
