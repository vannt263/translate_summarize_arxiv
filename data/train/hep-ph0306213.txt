    "due to the complication of a non - abelian @xmath2 gauge theory , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which describes the strong interaction , has many non - perturbative features such as the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry and quark confinement . in the study of hadron structure at low energy scale ,",
    "two kinds of models of qcd are often used , each incorporating some important qcd features .",
    "the constituent quark potential model which incorporates the qcd quark confinement has been impressively successful in hadron spectroscopy and decays @xcite , except for the pseudo - scalar @xmath0 meson which is a goldstone boson and has very low mass .",

    "on the other hand , the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite and several of its extensions @xcite which incorporate the chiral symmetry can describe the @xmath0 meson very well as a massless goldstone boson of dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry . however , the njl model lacks the important qcd property of quark confinement .    in ref .",
