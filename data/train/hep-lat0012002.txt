    "nonrelativistic bound states in qed and qcd provide an interesting and highly nontrivial problem to which effective field theory methods can be applied  @xcite .",
    "the qcd bound states we will consider are heavy @xmath2 states such as @xmath3 bound states or the @xmath4 system . in qed , the classic examples are hydrogen , muonium ( @xmath5 ) , and positronium .",
    "each of these systems has three important scales , @xmath6 the fermion mass , @xmath7 the fermion momentum , and @xmath8 , the fermion energy .",
    "( for hydrogen and muonium , @xmath6 is the electron mass or the reduced mass of the two particles . )",
    "the velocity @xmath9 is of order the coupling constant ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) , and we will only consider the case @xmath12 , @xmath13 so that nonperturbative effects are small .",
    "multiscale problems with widely separated scales are well suited for study using effective field theories . for example , if the problem has the scales @xmath14 , one first starts with the theory above @xmath15 , and matches to an effective theory below @xmath15 in which only modes with masses much smaller than @xmath15 are retained .",
    "the effective theory is then scaled using the renormalization group to the next scale @xmath16 . at this point ,",
    "particles with mass @xmath16 are integrated out to construct a new effective theory , and so on .",
    "the complicated multiscale computations of the original theory are reduced to a number of simpler single scale computations of matching and running in the effective theory .",
    "the effective theory method also allows one to sum logarithms of the ratio of mass scales @xmath17 using the renormalization group evolution between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the goal is to correctly separate the scale @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for nonrelativistic bound state problems using an effective field theory , and to sum large logarithms using the renormalization group .",
    "the large logarithms in this case are @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 which are proportional to @xmath23 , and lead to @xmath24 contributions to bound state energies .",
    "furthermore , for qcd , the effective theory also determines the scale of the strong coupling constant , i.e.  whether one should use @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "the nonrelativistic effective theory , nrqcd / nrqed , has been studied extensively in the past  @xcite . what is new is the precise formulation of the effective theory , and the way in which the renormalization group is scaling is implemented .",
    "the results presented here will be applied to the study of @xmath3 production in the threshold region .",
    "there is a large ratio of scales , @xmath28  gev , @xmath29  gev and @xmath30  gev , where @xmath31 is the typical velocity in the nonrelativistic bound state .",
    "clearly @xmath32 is not small , and summing logarithms is important in this case .",
    "the results are also useful in qed . while @xmath33 is small , it is important to compute to high orders because the experiments have high precision .",
    "the hydrogen lamb shift of 1057.845  mhz is known to an accuracy of 9  khz  @xcite , the hydrogen hyperfine splitting is measured to be  mhz  @xcite , and the muonium hyperfine splitting is  mhz  @xcite . the binding energy of hydrogen , @xmath34 is @xmath35  mhz , so the experimental error in the lamb shift of 10 ppm is a part in @xmath36 of the binding energy .",
    "we will be able to compute corrections of order @xmath37  khz to the lamb shift , which are relevant for the present comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "[ the counting of @xmath38 factors for bound states is a little different than the conventional counting  @xcite .",
    "potential loops give powers of @xmath11 whereas soft and ultrasoft loops give powers of @xmath39 . ]",
    "a detailed comparison of theory and experiment for qed can be found in refs .",
    "there are many interesting new results that have been obtained for qed and qcd  @xcite . for qed ,",
    "one finds a universal description of @xmath24 terms .",
    "a single renormalization group equation gives the lamb shift , hyperfine splitting and decay widths for hydrogen , muonium and positronium .",
    "the renormalization group method allows us to compute for the first time the @xmath40 lamb shift in positronium and the @xmath40 lamb shift in hydrogen and muonium including recoil corrections .",
    "it also resolves a controversy in the literature about the @xmath40 hydrogen lamb shift in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "the renormalization group method allows one to understand the structure of the qed perturbation series , and why the @xmath24 corrections terminate .",
    "the leading order series has a single term that contributes at order @xmath42 to the energy , and the next - to - leading order series terminates after three terms , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "one also finds some infinite series of terms in qed , but they have the form @xmath46 , rather than @xmath47 .    in qcd ,",
    "one is able to sort out the scales for @xmath10 , and decide whether the strong coupling is @xmath25 , @xmath26 , or @xmath27 .",
    "we also obtain the renormalization group improved computations of the bound states potentials in qcd .",
    "there are numerous applications of these results , and i will show an example of the dramatic improvement one obtains for the @xmath1 production cross - section near threshold  @xcite .",
    "the basic problem can be seen by drawing a few feynman diagrams . a typical gauge boson exchange in the @xmath48 channel such as fig .  [ fig:5a ]",
    "has momentum transfer of order @xmath49 . a wavefunction graph or radiated gauge boson graph such as figs .",

    "the feynman integrals in the full theory can be evaluated using the threshold expansion  @xcite . the important momentum regions ( in feynman gauge )",
    "are referred to in the literature as hard ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) , potential ( @xmath55 , @xmath49 ) , ultrasoft ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) and soft ( @xmath58 , @xmath49 ) .",
    "the threshold expansion momentum regions are often used to describe bound state computations ; however it is important to note that _ the threshold expansion is not an effective field theory_. to construct an effective field theory , one needs to include only modes that can be on - shell .",
    "the effective theory therefore has nonrelativistic fermions ( which are potential modes ) , and soft and ultrasoft gauge boson modes .",
    "the hard fermion and gauge boson momentum regions , the soft fermion momentum region , and the potential gauge boson momentum region do not require modes in the effective theory .",
    "the desired effective theory is valid for energies and momenta much smaller than the fermion mass @xmath6 .",
    "one can try expanding in powers of @xmath59 and @xmath60 as in heavy quark effective theory , so that the expansion parameter is @xmath61 .",
    "for example , the dispersion relation @xmath62 gives terms in the lagrangian of the form @xmath63 the lowest order propagator is @xmath64 , which gives @xmath65 in position space .",
    "this is the static propagator of hqet : fermions propagate forward in time , but do not move in space .",
    "this propagator is acceptable for some calculations involving heavy quarks .",
    "for example , one can compute the static potential between fixed sources using this propagator .",
    "however , for @xmath1 production , the quarks are produced at the same point , and they remain at the same point for all time if the static propagator is used .",
    "this is too singular , and the hqet expansion breaks down . in general , it is essential for treating nonrelativistic bound states that the heavy fermions move . for this to occur ,",
    "the lowest order propagator should be @xmath66 , so that @xmath52 and @xmath67 are of the same order in the effective theory power counting .",
    "this implies that the @xmath61 expansion can not be used ; instead one must use an expansion in powers of @xmath9 , where @xmath52 and @xmath67 are both of order @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "the effective theory expansion parameter is the velocity @xmath9 , and formally , @xmath11 must also be treated as order @xmath9 .",
    "thus order @xmath69 radiative corrections to the leading term are just as important as order @xmath68 relativistic corrections .",
    "the effective theory below the scale @xmath6 has :    * nonrelativistic fermions with propagator @xmath70 * ultrasoft gauge bosons coupled via interactions that are multipole expanded  @xcite .",
    "* potentials @xmath71 for the scattering of an incoming @xmath72 and @xmath73 with momenta @xmath74 and @xmath75 to outgoing @xmath72 and @xmath73 with momenta @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "* soft gauge bosons .",
    "the importance of introducing soft fields in the effective theory was first pointed out by griesshammer  @xcite .",
    "the effective theory has two different gauge boson fields , soft bosons and ultrasoft bosons .",
    "this does not lead to any double counting if graphs are evaluated in dimensional regularization .",
    "the static theory is not the @xmath78 limit or the @xmath79 limit of the effective theory .",
    "for this reason , the static potential and the effective theory potential are not equal .",
    "the power counting parameter of the effective theory is the velocity @xmath9 . if one expands the dispersion relation as in eq .",

    "the potential @xmath82 also has an expansion in powers of @xmath9 .",
    "the leading term is the coulomb potential , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the momentum transfer .",
    "since momentum is of order @xmath7 , the coulomb potential is naively of order @xmath85 .",
    "however , the potential is a four - fermion operator , whereas the kinetic energy is a two - fermion operator .",
    "this leads to an additional factor of @xmath9 from the power counting factors for the fields , so that the coulomb potential is of order @xmath86 in the effective theory .",
    "one can then determine the power counting for all the other potentials by comparing with the coulomb potential .",
    "the hyperfine interaction @xmath87 is generated by one - photon exchange , and is of order @xmath68 relative to the coulomb interaction , so it is of order @xmath88 in the power counting , as are the spin - orbit , tensor and contact ( darwin ) interactions . at one - loop , there are also potentials that are proportional to odd - powers of @xmath89 .",
