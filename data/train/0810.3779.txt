    "flavor changing neutral interactions ( fcni ) are forbidden at the tree level in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "therefore they have the potential to test higher order corrections to the sm and also constrain many of its possible extensions . among all fcni ,",
    "rare @xmath8 decays play an important role in searching new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the quark level fcni @xmath9 is responsible for ( i ) the inclusive semileptonic decay @xmath10 , ( ii ) the exclusive semileptonic decays @xmath11 , and ( iii ) the purely leptonic decay @xmath12 .",
    "both the inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decays have been observed experimentally @xcite with branching ratios close to their sm predictions @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the impact of these measurement on the new physics contribution to the branching ratio @xmath13 was considered .",
    "it was shown that new physics in the form of vector / axial - vector operators is severely constrained by the data on @xmath14 and @xmath15 , so an order of magnitude enhancement in the branching ratio of @xmath16 is ruled out .",
    "on the other hand , if new physics is in the form of scalar / pseudoscalar operators , then @xmath17 does not put any useful constraint on the new physics couplings and allows an order of magnitude enhancement in the @xmath13 .",
    "therefore @xmath18 is sensitive to an extended higgs sector . in @xcite ,",
    "the constraints on scalar / pseudoscalar new physics contribution to the @xmath14 were studied .",
    "it was shown that a large deviation in @xmath19 from its sm prediction is not possible .    in @xcite ,",
    "the forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry of leptons in semileptonic decays of mesons was introduced as an observable sensitive to the physics beyond the sm . in particular ,",
    "the fb asymmetry of muons , @xmath7 , in @xmath20 is important because its value is negligibly small in the sm @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that hadronic current for @xmath21 transition does not have any axial vector contribution ; it can have a nonzero value only if it receives contribution from new physics .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath7 for testing non - standard higgs sector has been studied in literature in detail @xcite . however in @xcite , it was shown that the present upper bound on the branching ratio of @xmath22 @xcite restricts the average ( or integrated ) fb asymmetry , @xmath23 , to about @xmath24 as long as the only new physics is in the form of scalar / pseudoscalar operators .",
    "such a small fb asymmetry is very difficult to be measured in experiments and hence searching for new scalar / pseudoscalar physics through @xmath23 will be a futile exercise .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry can also get contributions from tensor operators . in the sm , the tensor operators in @xmath25 arise at higher order in the electroweak operator product expansion from finite external momenta in the matching calculations , however their contribution is negligibly small and we shall not consider them in this paper . however in models beyond the sm , tensor operators may contribute significantly to the decay and to the asymmetry @xmath7 .",
    "for example , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the tensor operators arise from photino and zino box diagrams at the leading order operator product expansion @xcite .",
    "tensor operators can also be induced by scalar operators under renormalization group running @xcite . in leptoquark models ,",
    "tensor operators are induced by the interactions of leptoquarks with the sm higgs field @xcite .    in @xcite , the effect of these operators to @xmath23",
    "was studied , where it was shown that @xmath23 can be as high as @xmath26 at @xmath27 c.l .",
    "if new physics is only in the form of tensor operators , whereas it can rise to @xmath4 if both scalar / pseudoscalar and tensor new physics operators are present .",
    "the integrated asymmetry @xmath23 has been measured by babar @xcite and belle @xcite to be @xmath28 @xmath29 these measurements are consistent with zero .",
    "however , they can be as high as @xmath30 within @xmath31 error bars .",
    "future experiments like a super-@xmath8 factory or the lhc will increase the statistics by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "for example at atlas , the number of expected @xmath20 events even after analysis cuts is expected to be @xmath32 with @xmath33 fb@xmath34 data @xcite , which will be collected within the first three years .",
    "thus , @xmath35 can soon be probed to values as low as @xmath36 .",
    "with higher statistics , one will be able to determine even the distribution of @xmath7 as a function of the invariant dilepton mass squared @xmath3 , which can provide a stronger handle on this quantity than just its average value @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , since the theoretical predictions for the rate of @xmath20 are rather uncertain in the intermediate @xmath3 region ( @xmath37  gev@xmath38  gev@xmath6 ) owing to the vicinity of charmed resonances , it is important to look at the quantity @xmath0 in the complete @xmath3 range so that its robust features may be identified .",
    "indeed , it turns out that with the new physics considered in this paper , @xmath0 is high near the high-@xmath3 end point .",
    "in this paper we study @xmath0 in the complete @xmath3 region and explore the possibility of large fb asymmetry in some specific regions of the dilepton invariant mass spectrum .",
