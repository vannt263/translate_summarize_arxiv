    "there has been enormous interest@xcite over the past decade in systems that can be tuned via pressure , magnetic field , or composition , to be in proximity to zero temperature phase transitions , or quantum critical points , qpc .",
    "this interest stems from the non - standard , or non - fermi liquid , nfl , behavior commonly found@xcite in metals near qcp s .",
    "many of the systems investigated , particularly those that are tuned by way of chemical substitution , are significantly disordered and the role of the disorder in determining the physical properties is not well understood@xcite .",
    "recent theoretical work@xcite has focused on the emergence of griffiths phases in disordered materials where statistically rare regions of order , or disorder , can dominate the thermodynamic response .",
    "this appears particularly relevant near zero temperature phase transitions where the formation of griffiths phases in disordered metals is thought to be the cause of the nfl behavior observed over wide regions of composition , temperature and magnetic field .    in a previous paper@xcite we presented , and",
    "in the accompanying article@xcite expand upon , the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the magnetic semiconductor fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 which displays features consistent with the formation of griffiths phases@xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated the formation of clusters of magnetic moments both at low temperatures for @xmath4 less than @xmath6 , the critical concentration for a long ranged magnetic ground state , as well as at temperatures above the critical temperature , @xmath9 , for @xmath7 . here , @xmath9 is defined as the temperature where the real part of the ac susceptibility displays a maximum ( see ref .  [ ] ) . in the temperature range where these clusters form we",
    "find power - law temperature , @xmath10 , and magnetic field , @xmath11 , dependencies with small exponents in agreement with that predicted for griffiths phases .    here , we investigate in more full detail the charge transport properties of these compounds to explore the consequences of griffiths phase formation .",
    "we find that the co substitution induces metallic behavior with a small density of electron - type carriers in all of our co doped crystals , including our most lightly doped ( @xmath12 ) . for samples with @xmath13",
    "the resistivity , @xmath14 , and magnetoresistance , mr , are consistent with kondo scattering of the carriers@xcite .",
    "that is , we observe a logarithmically decreasing @xmath15 and a @xmath16 that scale as @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is the kondo temperature and @xmath19 the zero field resistivity . as we increase @xmath4 beyond @xmath6 we find that magnetic ordering produces an increasing @xmath15 up to temperatures somewhat above @xmath9 , similar to what is observed in metallic spin glasses@xcite .",
    "the application of a magnetic field of 5 t dramatically reduces the resistivity of these samples by up to 35% at low temperatures . in this way",
    "the system resembles common metals with magnetic impurities with kondo behavior seen at low impurity concentrations and a decreasing @xmath14 with decreasing @xmath10 below a spin glass temperature for higher impurity concentrations@xcite .",
    "as is true of nearly all metals that display kondo anomalies , the resistivity of our fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 crystals displays fermi liquid behavior at temperatures well below @xmath18@xcite . here , we observe a temperature independent resistivity below 0.5 k for samples having both @xmath13 as well as those with @xmath20 .",
    "the main difference between our crystals and common kondo systems is that fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 has a small density of charge carriers and poor conduction in the range of @xmath4 that we investigate .",
    "a typical figure of merit for transport in disordered metals is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the fermi wave vector and @xmath23 is the mean - free - path of the charge carriers . here",
    ", @xmath21 is between 1.5 and 15 for @xmath24 a range typical of doped semiconductors in proximity to the insulator - to - metal ( i m ) transition where quantum contributions to the conductivity are expected@xcite .",
    "quantum interference effects , such as the electron - electron interaction effects@xcite described by altshuler , are expected under the conditions of diffusive transport and low temperatures such that the elastic scattering time for carriers is much shorter than the time required to randomize the charge carrier s quantum phase . under these conditions a square - root singularity in the electronic density of states",
    "is thought to form , resulting in a @xmath25 and @xmath26 dependent conductivity@xcite .",
    "measurements in doped semiconductors , including some magnetic semiconductors , display the typical signatures of electron - electron interaction effects , including the positive mr and a distinctive scaling of the conductivity in @xmath27@xcite .",
    "we observe none of these standard behaviors of disordered fermi liquid behavior , instead finding a negative mr and a temperature independent conductivity at @xmath28500 mk , despite the small values of @xmath21 that we infer .",
    "the absence of quantum interference effects in the conductivity of our samples is puzzling .",
    "we point out , however , that there is reason to believe that the charge carriers have a substantial inelastic scattering rate even at the lowest temperatures we measure . the high density of low lying magnetic excitations associated with the magnetic griffiths phases that we have identified in this system are likely to provide a large inelastic scattering cross - section for the charge carriers , even at temperatures well below 1 k@xcite .",
    "we speculate that the condition for observation of the quantum corrections to the conductivity , that the carriers retain quantum coherence over times much longer than the inelastic scattering time@xcite , is not met in our samples because of the magnetic scattering .",
    "reduction of the magnetic scattering by application of magnetic fields as large as 9 t does not appear sufficient to restore the quantum interference effects as the resistivity continues to be @xmath10 independent even at such large fields .    beyond the surprising lack of quantum interference effects , we observe no indication of nfl behavior in the transport properties of our fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 crystals .",
    "thus , just as in the prototypical semiconducting systems such as phosphorous doped silicon@xcite , nfl behavior observed in the magnetic and thermodynamic properties that persist into the metallic side of the i m transition , does not lead to nfl charge transport . in si : p , where disordered fermi liquid transport is observed@xcite , the implication is that the conducting electrons and the more localized dopants which dominate the magnetization and specific heat , @xmath29 , only interact weakly .",
    "it has even been postulated that the these two electron fluids reside in physically separate regions of the disordered semiconductor .",
    "in contrast , in fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 , we find convincing evidence that the conducting electrons and the localized electrons responsible for the magnetic properties of these materials interact substantially .",
    "the kondo resistance anomaly , so clearly defined in our data , indicates the importance of such an interaction . yet ,",
    "surprisingly , we do not observe any indication of nfl behavior in the charge carrier transport to the lowest temperatures measured despite ample evidence for nfl response of @xmath30 and @xmath31@xcite .",
    "there are several other peculiarities that we observe in our samples with co concentrations closest to the critical concentration for the nucleation of a finite temperature long range magnetic phase .",
    "first , we have measured a very large anomalous hall coefficient , @xmath32 , for samples with @xmath4 near @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath32 becomes much smaller as @xmath4 is increased .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath32 does not appear to scale with the resistivity of our samples in the manner predicted by the accepted models@xcite of the anomalous hall effect .",
    "in addition , we observe a residual resistivity ratio , rrr , defined as the resistivity at 300 k divided by the resistivity at 4 k , that is nearly 2 for all samples except those with @xmath4 near @xmath6 , where it is almost twice as large .",
    "this indicates that there is an additional temperature dependent scattering mechanism beyond the typical phonon induced carrier scattering of common metals@xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that fits of the bloch model for phonon scattering in metals do not completely describe @xmath15 for samples with @xmath8 . instead , we find that a simple @xmath33 dependence with @xmath34 , describes @xmath15 well over a large temperature range .",
    "the success of this simple form in modeling our data suggests that magnetic fluctuation scattering may be important over a wide @xmath10 range for samples in proximity to a zero temperature phase transition@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to provide a more full rendering of our hall effect , resistivity , and magnetoresistance data and analysis than that published previously@xcite .",
    "in addition , we emphasize here the absence of quantum contributions to the low temperature transport that was not included in our previous work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we outline some of important experimental details of the sample preparation , the initial characterization , and the measurement techniques in section [ sec : exptdet ] .",
    "this is followed by a presentation of our hall effect data and analysis .",
    "the resistivity and magnetoresistance of our fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 crystals is presented in section [ sec : conductivity ] .",
    "finally we summarize our results in section [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "single crystals of fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 were synthesized from high purity starting materials , including fe powder ( alfa aesar 99.998% ) , co powder ( alfa aesar 99.998% ) , and sulfur ( alfa aesar 99.999% ) as described previously@xcite .",
    "initial characterization included single crystal x - ray diffraction as described in refs .. the lattice constant determined by the x - ray diffraction experiments@xcite showed a systematic increase with co concentration , @xmath4 , in fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 , beyond the lattice constant for pure fes@xmath2 , @xmath35 nm and consistent with the measurements of ref .. the increase in lattice constant with @xmath4 is consistent with vegard s law and the idea that co replaces fe within the pyrite crystal structure .",
    "energy - dispersive x - ray microanalysis ( edx ) on jeol scanning electron microscope equipped with a kevex si(li ) detector was performed to check the stoichiometry of our samples and were found to be consistent with the magnetic moment density determined by our dc magnetization measurements@xcite . because magnetization measurements were easily performed and highly reproducible , we have subsequently used the saturated magnetization to determine the co concentration of our samples .",
    "thus , throughout this manuscript the stoichiometry of the samples noted in the figures and text was determined in this manner .",
    "the variations in the saturated magnetization for crystals from the same growth batch was measured to be @xmath36 10% of the average value .",

    "the ac susceptibility was used to establish the magnetic phase diagram identifying curie temperatures , @xmath9 , and the critical co concentration for formation of a magnetic ground state , @xmath38@xcite .",
    "resistivity , magnetoresistance ( mr ) , and hall effect measurements were performed on single crystals polished with emery paper to an average size of 0.5 mm x 1 mm x 0.1 mm .",
    "thin pt wires were attached to four contacts made with epotek conductive silver epoxy .",
    "hall effect measurements were performed at 17 or 19 hz on samples with carefully aligned voltage leads in a quantum design mpms gas flow cryostat from 1.8 to 300 k. these measurements were done in a superconducting magnet with fields ranging from -5 to 5 t and the hall voltage , @xmath39 , was determined as @xmath40/2 $ ] , to correct for any contamination from the field symmetric mr due to misalignment of the contacts .",
    "the resistivity and mr measurements were performed at 17 or 19 hz using standard lock - in techniques in the quantum design mpms gas flow cryostat with a 5 t superconducting magnet and a dilution refrigerator equipped with a 9 t superconducting magnet .",
    "we begin our discussion of the transport properties of the charge carriers donated by the co substitution by presenting our hall effect measurements which give us an estimate of the charge carrier densities in our crystals . in fig .",

    "the observation of a low - field positive contribution to @xmath41 is not surprising since magnetic materials typically have two contributions to their hall resistivities , an ordinary part due to the lorentz force experienced by the carriers proportional to @xmath11 and inversely proportional to the carrier density , and an anomalous part proportional to the sample s magnetization .",

    ", there appears to be a separate , @xmath10-dependent , contribution to the conductivity of our crystals evident below @xmath69 k.      the temperature dependence of the charge carrier transport at low temperatures can often reveal much about the character of the charge carriers and their scattering .",

    "in addition , we observe that @xmath14 tends toward saturation by @xmath72 k , a behavior typically observed in metals without substantial disorder where it is indicative of transport in a fermi liquid .",
    "the resistivities we measure are above 500 @xmath73 cm , consistent with the small carrier concentration revealed in our hall effect measurements and a large scattering rate .",

    ", we observe a temperature independent resistivity below 1 k with no indication of quantum interference effects in the carrier transport .",
    "the coincidental observation of the formation of an interesting disordered magnetic phase and the absence of quantum interference in the electrical conductivity suggests that the scattering of carriers from magnetic excitations associated with the co dopant ions is substantially inelastic .",

    "[ eq : hamann ] , consistent with the the low-@xmath10 data , to our model in order to accurately model the resistivity at @xmath107 k. in this procedure we have varied the impurity resistivity , @xmath74 , the carrier mass enhancement , and @xmath104 , while keeping the carrier density fixed to the value determined from the hall effect measurements and assuming a spherical fermi surface to estimate @xmath22 , in order to find the best representation of our data .",
    "the results of this procedure are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoplv3 ] a and b by the solid lines .",
    "the difference between the data and model is presented as a percentage of the measured resistivity in frame c of the figure , and the best fit values of @xmath104 displayed in frame d. best fit values of the carrier mass ranged between 1 and 1.5 times the bare electron mass . from the quality of the fits shown in the figure",
    ", we conclude that the semiclassical treatment adequately describes the resistivity of our samples over a wide range of @xmath10 with a few notable exceptions and qualifications .",
    "the first , as is apparent in frame c of the figure , is that the model does not accurately describe the behavior below 100 k. in particular , for samples with @xmath4 close to @xmath6 , the model deviates substantially from the data near 50 k. in addition , the values of @xmath104 determined from our fitting procedure for crystals with @xmath89 are much larger than the debye temperature of pure fes@xmath2 which would be surprising if true .",
    "we have considered a simple alternative to the standard phonon scattering model of resistivity motivated by our observation that the resistivity data appear to have a nearly linear @xmath10-dependence over a wide range in @xmath10 .",
    "this alternative , demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhopl ] , consists of a simple power - law form , @xmath108 , added to the same kondo description of the low-@xmath10 data ( eq .  [ eq : hamann ] ) as in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoplv3 ] . the results of this procedure where @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath74 are allowed to vary",
    "is represented in frames a and b of fig .",
    "[ fig : rhopl ] by the dashed lines .",
    "the ability of such a simple model to reproduce the data is remarkable .",
    "in fact , the difference between the data and model shown in frame c of fig .  [",
    "fig : rhopl ] is smaller for samples with @xmath8 than the much more complex debye model of fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoplv3 ] , although some systematic differences remain below 100 k. the best fit values of the temperature exponent , @xmath109 , are shown in frame d where @xmath109 is seen to change from about 2.5 for small @xmath4 ( @xmath111 ) to values between 1.2 and 1.6 .",
    "why such a simple expression does such an accurate job of describing our resistivity data is not clear .",
    "however , we suggest that the formation of a magnetically ordered state at low-@xmath10 implies that scattering from magnetic fluctuations plays an important role in determining @xmath15",
    ". the large reduction of the residual resistivity by the application of moderately sized magnetic fields , a decrease of 45% of @xmath74 with a 9 t field as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrfspl ] , supports the idea that magnetic scattering is a substantial fraction of @xmath74 .",
    "our observation that the rrr@xmath112 for samples near @xmath6 , along with the observation that the debye model for carrier scattering from phonons has systematic differences with the data , and the quality of fits of a simple power law temperature dependence to @xmath15 , all indicate magnetic fluctuations to be an important contribution to the carrier scattering in this range of @xmath4 over a wide temperature range .",
    "the simple power - law analysis of @xmath15 at @xmath113 k has demonstrated that the resistivity of our samples closely resembles a @xmath114 dependence with @xmath115 in a wide range of @xmath4 and @xmath10 . in order to assess the systematics and validity of this model we have plotted the quantity @xmath116 in fig . [ fig : rhosys2 ] . in this way we can compare scattering rates in samples with very different carrier concentrations , and remove the error associated with the measurement of the geometry of our crystals .",
    "if the power - law expression were to strictly hold , this quantity would yield the parameter @xmath110 divided by the residual resistivity .",
    "dividing by @xmath74 normalizes @xmath110 by eliminating the simple effects of carrier concentration and impurity scattering rate changes with @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the figure isolates the magnitude of this quantity related to the @xmath10-dependent part of the scattering rate of the carriers .",
    "the figure demonstrates that this value is very closely clustered about @xmath117 k@xmath118 for nearly all of our samples .",
    "the obvious exceptions are the crystals with @xmath4 nearest to @xmath6 on the paramagnetic side where a value of @xmath119 to 6@xmath120 k@xmath118 is found , reflecting the observation of a much larger rrr in these samples .",
    "it appears from this simple analysis that the @xmath10-dependent scattering rate above @xmath121 k is extraordinarily independent of @xmath4 for @xmath7 while is at least twice as large for @xmath122 . from this",
    "we conclude that there is a carrier scattering mechanism that is enhanced very near the critical concentration for magnetism in this system .",
    "given the power - law like dependence on @xmath10 , we assert that carrier scattering from magnetic fluctuations contributes a significant fraction of the resistivity over the entire temperature range we measure .",
    "resistivities , and thus by implication charge carrier scattering rates , that display similar temperature dependent power law behaviors for @xmath123 k have been documented for nearly ferromagnetic and weakly ferromagnetic metals such as pd@xmath0ni@xmath1@xcite and zrzn@xmath2@xcite , where scattering from spin fluctuations produces a @xmath124 dependence of @xmath14 .",
    "this behavior is observed in highly itinerant magnets where a stoner - wholfarth model of magnetism@xcite is appropriate and is thought to signify the emergence of a marginal fermi liquid ground state@xcite .",
    "a second group of materials well known for having power - law @xmath10-dependent resistivities , @xmath125 , with small @xmath109 , for @xmath126 , are those near quantum critical points ( qcp ) , such as a zero-@xmath10 magnetic critical point .",
    "examples include mnsi under pressure@xcite , ce(cu@xmath0au@xmath1)@xmath127@xcite , and ybrh@xmath2si@xmath2@xcite .",
    "none of these examples display power - law behavior above about 20 k. one exception is the high temperature superconducting oxides of copper where @xmath128 has been documented for over - doped samples of la@xmath129sr@xmath1cuo@xmath130 over an enormous temperature range@xcite .",
    "how the temperature dependent resistivity of fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 we observe here fits into this evolving story is not clear .",
    "however , we point out that all of these materials reside near a magnetic phase transition that has been tuned toward zero temperature .    a simple picture that can explain the @xmath131 temperature dependence is to assume that the electrons are scattered by spin wave excitations of the disordered system .",
    "these spin waves are the excitations around the griffiths phase ordered state .",
    "we assume that the density of states of spin waves in the disordered system varies as @xmath132 as it does in a clean system , despite the fact that the spin waves do not have a well defined momentum . in calculating the scattering of an electron",
    "we include all spin wave energies up to about @xmath133 , leading to a net scattering rate that varies as @xmath131 .",
    "because the spin excitations have no well defined momentum , even low energy scattering events can result in large momentum changes for the electron , so the transport lifetime is similar to the single particle lifetime , unlike the case in clean materials where the phonon scattering varies as @xmath134 instead of @xmath135 because of the momeuntum conservation in the scattering .",
    "this scattering process will persist well above the curie temperature , as it does in clean materials where neutron scattering typically sees a well defined spin wave peak even for temperatures well above the onset of order .",
    "in fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 we have previously observed that the co dopants each contribute localized magnetic moments to the slightly diamagnetic insulator fes@xmath2@xcite .",
    "these moments tend to form magnetic clusters and at low @xmath10 we have observed the emergence of a disordered ferromagnetic phase at @xmath136 .",
    "our hall effect data presented here reveal a density of electrical carriers of only 10 to 30% of the co concentration indicating a substantial localization of electrons donated by the co substitution .",
    "a slight curvature evident in the plots of the hall potential vs.  the magnetic field may indicate the existence of a small population of compensating holes .",
    "the reasons for the low carrier densities is not clear at this time but may reflect a significant substitutional - related disorder . in the magnetically ordered samples we observe an anomalous hall effect with a very large coefficient ( @xmath32 ) which decreases with @xmath4 .",
    "measurements of the low-@xmath10 conductivity show that the charge carriers interact substantially with the magnetic moments in this system .",
    "we have presented evidence that the kondo effect dominates the carrier transport for @xmath13 for @xmath137 k and , as is the case for both simple metals with magnetic impurities and kondo lattice systems@xcite , the resistivity saturates at low @xmath10 .",
    "we point out that the carrier densities estimated from the hall effect are sufficient to screen only a small fraction of the doping induced magnetic moments , leaving the system highly underscreened or undercompensated .",
    "the temperature independent @xmath14 at the lowest @xmath10 s indicate a fermi liquid ground state with contributions from quantum interference effects commonly observed in doped semiconductors surprisingly absent .",
    "the usual indicator for the observation of quantum contributions to the conductivity , @xmath21 is well within the range where such effects are expected in our data .",
    "the reason for the absence of such contributions is not completely clear .",
    "we speculate that the charge carrier inelastic scattering rate does not become much smaller than the elastic scattering rate at low temperatures as is required for the observation of quantum effects .",
    "the source of the inelastic scattering most likely involves the magnetic degrees of freedom associated with the nearly magnetically ordered ( for @xmath89 ) , or the spin - glass - like or disordered ferromagnetic , phase ( for @xmath7 ) .",
    "as we have asserted previously , the disorder associated with the chemical substitution leads to the formation of a magnetic griffiths phase which may provide an enormous density of low energy excitations and a source for inelastic scattering for the charge carriers .",
    "the application of a magnetic field substantially decreases the resistivity of our fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 crystals at low-@xmath10@xcite .",
    "this is typical of magnetic materials since the field gaps the low frequency magnetic fluctuation spectrum and removes much of the inelastic carrier scattering .",
    "despite the decreased scattering with the application of magnetic fields , we still do not observe any quantum interference effects .",
    "the low temperature transport properties of fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 we outline above are substantially different from those of co and mn substituted fesi , a second magnetic semiconducting system where detailed low-@xmath10 measurements have been carried out@xcite . while both of the nominally pure compounds , fes@xmath2 and fesi , have small band gaps and are nonmagnetic having very small magnetic susceptibilities , both become magnetic upon electron doping via co substitution . however , electron doping of fesi results in a highly itinerant helimagnetic ground state where standard quantum contributions to the conductivity are dominant .",
    "clearly this is distinct from what we measure here in fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "hole doping fesi by way of mn substitution is similar to fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 in that it was found to display undercompensation@xcite . here ,",
    "the mn dopants contribute a spin-1 moment and a single spin-1/2 hole carrier .",
    "the resistivity of these compounds remained @xmath10-dependent down to the lowest temperatures , however , the temperature dependence was not the @xmath75 behavior found in standard semiconducting systems such as si : p@xcite .",
    "the nfl behavior discovered in fe@xmath0mn@xmath1si is in agreement with calculations predicting a singular fermi liquid in the undercompensated kondo model@xcite .",
    "in addition , the application of modest magnetic fields reduces the inelastic scattering and restores the typical temperature and field dependencies expected for quantum interference effects@xcite .",
    "we remain puzzled as to the cause of dramatic differences in the transport properties of these , naively similar , magnetic semiconducting systems .",
    "finally , the temperature dependence of the resistivity in the @xmath10-range where phonon scattering dominates the @xmath14 of typical metals shows some peculiarities . in particular , the temperature dependence of the resistivity is enhanced for samples with @xmath4 very near @xmath6 , having a rrr twice as large as samples on either side of @xmath6 . although a semiclassical model of carrier - phonon scattering describes the broad features of @xmath15 our models show systematic differences with the data below 100 k for the samples with @xmath138 .",
    "we have demonstrated that a simple power - law form surprisingly describes the data at least as well as the semiclassical model@xcite in this range of @xmath4 .",
    "we speculate that the resistivity of these compounds results , in part , from magnetic fluctuation scattering of the carriers , even at temperatures approaching room @xmath10 .    in summary , co doping of fes@xmath2 adds both local magnetic moments and electron charge carriers to this band gap insulator .",
    "our data indicate that although the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of fe@xmath0co@xmath1s@xmath2 for @xmath139 are dominated by the presence of griffiths phases at low temperatures , the transport is fermi liquid like .",
    "it appears that there is a kondo coupling of the carriers and local magnetic moments that produces a temperature independent resistivity below @xmath140 k. despite the small mean - free - path of the doped charge carriers we observe no indication of quantum corrections to the conductivity which we speculate is due to a large inelastic scattering rate of the carriers .",
    "thus , our data indicate that there may be a range over which the inelastic scattering rate is too large for quantum contributions to be observable , and yet too small to induce non - fermi liquid behavior in the transport of disordered conductors ."
