    "interference is an essentially important topic in optical physics , resulting in many interesting phenomena and important applications .",
    "the key physics lying behind interference is the superposition principle .",
    "after the birth of quantum physics , it was realized that superposition of multiple single - photon paths plays a key role in the traditional optical interference phenomenon , which is usually known as dirac s famous statement : _ `` each photon interferes only with itself .",
    "interference between different photons never occurs ''",
    "_  @xcite .    in 1956 , hanbury brown and twiss introduced the second - order correlation measurement , and reported a new type of interference effect between independent photons , i.e. , the bunching effect of thermal light  @xcite .",
    "soon after , it was realized that superposition of two indistinguishable two - photon paths plays a key role in this type of interference effect  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ path1 ] , for every pair of independent photons , there are two indistinguishable paths for the pair of photons to trigger a coincidence count , and the amplitudes of these two paths are always of the same random phase @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the random phase of the point source emitting photons @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the interference term between the two amplitudes will survive in the ensemble average , leading to the constructive or destructive two - photon interference .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    later , mandel gave a detailed theoretical analysis of two - photon interference between two independent sources with random phases , and predicted that the visibility of two - photon interference fringes has a maximum value of 50% for classical light  @xcite .",
    "in general , for the case of two - photon interference with independent light sources , the coincidence counts consist of two parts : ( i ) the self - correlation part with the pair of photons from the same source which contributes a constant to the correlation function .",
    "( ii ) the cross - correlation part with the pair of photons from different sources , which is dominated by the superposition of the two indistinguishable paths as depicted in fig .",
    "[ path1 ] , resulting in the two - photon interference fringes .",
    "it is the existence of part ( i ) that will low down the visibility of two - photon interference fringes . for a quantum source such as the single - photon state , the self - correlation contribution",
    "could be eliminated , and therefore giving rise to a 100%-visibility two - photon interference  @xcite . however , for a classical light , the self - correlation always contributes , which makes the visibility of two - photon interference fringes not exceeding 50% .",
    "this property of two - photon interference with independent random - phase sources was further discussed and demonstrated by paul  @xcite , ou  @xcite and klyshko  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the visibility of multi - photon interference fringes of classical lights based on third- and higher - order coherence could be higher than 50%  @xcite .    in this paper , without the introduction of third- and higher - order correlation measurement",
    ", we explore another way to achieve high visibility two - photon interference with classical light . instead of reducing or even removing the self - correlation contribution as in the case of quantum sources",
    ", we increase the cross - correlation contribution by introducing the superposition of multiple indistinguishable two - photon paths ( path number @xmath32 ) to enhance the two - photon interference effect of a classical light .",
    "this could be practically realized by introducing a random - phase grating to modulate the wavefront of a coherent light .",
    "the random - phase grating is shown schematically in fig .  [ grating](a ) .",

    "a random phase @xmath7 will be encoded on the light wave transmitting through the @xmath8 slit , where @xmath9 is an integer and the phase @xmath10 changes randomly with time .",
    "such a random - phase grating can be realized through a spatial light modulator ( slm ) in practice , as we will demonstrate in the following .",
    "it is evident that there will be no stationary first - order interference for a coherent light transmitting through the random - phase grating since the phase difference between every two slits changes randomly with time .",

    "for each pair of slits , the @xmath12 and @xmath8 slits , of the random - phase grating , there are always two indistinguishable two - photon paths as shown in fig .",
    "[ path1 ] : ( 1 ) one photon transmitting through the @xmath12 slit goes to the detector d1 , while the other transmitting through the @xmath8 slit goes to the detector d2 ; and ( 2 ) one photon transmitting through the @xmath12 slit goes to the detector d2 , while the other transmitting through the @xmath8 slit goes to the detector d1 . note that the same random phase @xmath13 is encoded on the amplitudes of the two different but indistinguishable two - photon paths . for a @xmath4-slit random - phase grating as shown in fig .  [ grating ] , one may find that there are many such twin two - photon paths originated from different pairs of slits ( @xmath14 , @xmath9 ) , and the amplitudes of those twin paths with equal ( @xmath15 ) will contain the same random phase @xmath13 .",
    "these twin two - photon paths are indistinguishable in principle . in this way",
