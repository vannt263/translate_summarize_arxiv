    "some years ago , it was shown  @xcite that two phenomenological colour dipole models - the saturation model of golec - biernat and wsthoff  @xcite and the two - component model of forshaw , kerley and shaw  @xcite - yielded a rather good description of the diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) data  @xcite .",
    "these successes were achieved without adjusting any of the parameters of the models , which had been previously determined by fits to the deep inelastic structure function data at small-@xmath1  @xcite . in both cases",
    "the ddis structure function @xmath5 was found to be dominated by the @xmath6 dipole contribution at large @xmath7 , corresponding to diffractively produced states with invariant mass @xmath8 , but at small @xmath7 , corresponding to @xmath9 , a @xmath10 contribution becomes important ( see below ) .",
    "subsequently , both models have been successfully applied to a variety of other processes @xcite .",
    "more recently a new colour dipole model , the colour glass condensate ( cgc ) model of iancu , itakura and munier @xcite , has aroused considerable interest .",
    "this model can be thought of as a development of the golec - biernat ",
    "wsthoff saturation model .",
    "however , while still largely a phenomenological parameterisation , the authors claim that it contains the main features of the `` color glass condensate '' regime , where the gluon densities are high and non - linear effects become important .",
    "the parameters of the model have again been fixed by fitting the structure function data , which are now extremely precise , and the model has subsequently been shown to yield a good description of both @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite electroproduction data , with reasonable choices for the vector meson wavefunctions .",
    "however it has not yet been applied to ddis , an omission which we propose to rectify in this short paper .",
    "in the colour dipole model ( fig .  [ fig : fluct ] ) , the dipole cross - section @xmath15 is related to the photon - proton cross - section via @xmath16 is the transverse separation of the qq pair , @xmath17 is the fraction of the incoming photon light - cone energy carried by the quark , and the variable @xmath18 is chosen to be either @xmath19 , the squared cms energy of the photon - proton system , or the bjorken scaling variable @xmath1 .",

    "the leading order bfkl equation fixes @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath35 is strongly correlated to the definition of the saturation scale and the authors find that the quality of fit to @xmath36 data is only weakly dependent upon its value . for a fixed value of @xmath35 , there are therefore three parameters which need to be fixed by a fit to the structure function data , i.e. @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in this paper , we take @xmath40 and a light quark mass of @xmath41 mev , for which the fit values are @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 fm .",

    "we show two curves : the dashed red line uses the more compact parameterization of the dipole cross - section presented first in @xcite whilst the blue dotted line is generated using the original `` fit 1 '' parameterization of @xcite . as anticipated there is not much difference between the two fks curves .",
    "there is also not very much difference between the cgc and gw curves , reflecting the fact that these two models use quite similar dipole cross - sections .",

    ", width=680 ]    all our predictions contain no adjustable parameters in the dipole cross - section itself .",
    "however , we are free to adjust the forward slope for inclusive diffraction , @xmath31 , within the range acceptable to experiment .",
    "this simply affects the overall normalization of @xmath0 .",
    "one can substantially improve the quality of the cgc fit to the data by lowering @xmath31 towards the lower end acceptable to experiment , i.e. @xmath59  gev@xmath52 .",
    "we are also somewhat free to vary the value of @xmath58 used to define the normalization of the @xmath60 component , which enters at low to intermediate values of @xmath7 , indeed choosing @xmath61 for the fks model leads to a much improved fit . in figure",
    "[ fig : f2d3modify ] we compare the cgc model , with the lower @xmath31 parameter , and the fks model , with the lower value of @xmath58 , to the h1 data .",
    "both models now agree rather well with the data .     compared with zeus 1994 data using the cgc dipole model .",
    "solid black line : total contribution ; dashed blue line : @xmath6 contribution ; dotted red line : @xmath62 contribution ; dashed - dotted orange line : longitudinal @xmath63 contribution .",
    ", width=529 ]    finally , in figure [ fig : f2d3components ] we show a breakdown of the cgc model , with the lower value of @xmath64  gev@xmath52 , into its various components and its comparison with the zeus data .",
    "the solid black line is again the total contribution whilst the blue dashed line is the contribution from @xmath6 dipoles ( light quarks only ) , the red dotted line is the contribution from @xmath62 dipoles and orange dash - dot line is the contribution from the light quark dipoles produced by longitudinally polarized photons .",
    "we note that , in the region where the @xmath6 contribution is dominant ( i.e. at larger values of @xmath7 ) , approaches based upon the dipole model have very little room for manoeuvre .",
    "in particular , only the normalization is uncertain within the range allowed by the error on the measurement of the @xmath31 parameter .",
    "we have used the dipole parameterization of iancu , itakura and munier @xcite to predict the diffractive structure function @xmath0 .",
    "this parameterization is anticipated to capture some of the essential dynamics of the colour glass condensate approach , in which saturation in @xmath1 at fixed @xmath65 is an essential feature .",
    "agreement with the data is reasonably good provided that one accepts a forward slope for diffraction of @xmath66  gev@xmath52 .",
    "we note that the cgc predictions are very similar to the previous predictions of golec - biernat & wsthoff @xcite . in a previous paper",
    ", we have shown that the cgc model is also capable of describing the data on exclusive vector meson production @xcite .",
    "however , we stress that the same data are also consistent with a `` two pomeron '' model @xcite in which there is no low @xmath1 saturation .",
    "indeed figure [ fig : f2d3modify ] of this paper compares the predictions of the fks and cgc models to the @xmath0 data . as such",
    "we conclude that the data are not yet precise enough , nor do they extend to sufficiently small values of @xmath67 , to descriminate between these very different theoretical approaches .",
