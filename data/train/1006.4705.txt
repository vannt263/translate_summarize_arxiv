    "the bose gas plays a significant role in understanding a series of exotic quantum phenomena , including superfluidity and superconductivity .",
    "it is well known that the ideal bose gas exhibits the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) below a critical temperature . in 1938 , london first connected bec to the @xmath3 transition in helium.@xcite in 1946 , ogg proposed that the bec of bosonic electron - pairs might result in superconductivity.@xcite furthermore , schafroth@xcite and blatt and butler@xcite showed that an ideal gas of charged bosons exhibits the essential equilibrium features of a superconductor . although the bcs theory@xcite revealed that electrons in a superconductor form cooper - pairs , as opposed to real - space pairs , the schafroth - blatt - butler theory is helpful to the understanding of superconductivity and more importantly it stimulated research interest in charged bose gases .",
    "the charged bose gas ( cbg ) is solely of academic interest in its own right .",
    "especially , it exhibits nontrivial magnetic properties . for example , the condensation phenomenon in cbgs is strongly affected by the external magnetic field , owing to the quantization of the orbital motion of charged particles in magnetic field.@xcite schafroth clearly indicated that an arbitrarily small value of the magnetic field introduces qualitative changes : bec does no longer occur.@xcite may extended this idea to a @xmath4-dimensional cbg and found that it can condense only for @xmath5.@xcite this point was reexamined by other researchers based on different methods.@xcite meanwhile , the orbital motion results in extremely large landau diamagnetism in cbgs .",
    "it was pointed out that the 3-dimensional cbg displays meissner effect at low temperatures.@xcite more recently , alexandrov quantitatively accounted for the enhanced normal - state diamagnetism of superconducting cuprates using the cbg model.@xcite    on the other hand , neutral bosons with spin ( spinor bosons ) have also been studied theoretically.@xcite the realization of spinor bose condensate in optically trapped alkali atoms@xcite stimulates new research interest .",
    "the constituent atoms , such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 have ( hyperfine ) spin degrees of freedom and thus a magnetic moment .",
    "their spin degrees of freedom become active in purely optical traps and thus investigation of their magnetic properties becomes possible .",
    "yamada@xcite , and simkin and cohen@xcite calculated the magnetization of neutral spinor bosons in magnetic field and found that once bec takes place , the magnetization remains finite even if @xmath9 , as if the system was magnetized spontaneously .",
    "the zero - field susceptibility tends to diverge as the temperature goes down to the bec temperature .",
    "moreover , rigorous proofs presented by eisenberg and lieb show that the magnetization and zero - field susceptibility at finite temperatures exceed that of a pure paramagnet.@xcite all the results indicate that the neutral spinor bosons take on extraordinary paramagnetic effect in magnetic field .    bearing in mind the two contrary features of the bose gas ,",
    "one immediate question which must be raised is : which kind of magnetism will manifest itself if the bosons possess both the charge and spin degrees of freedom ?",
    "analogously , this question has been answered for charged fermi gases , e.g. , the electron gas , where both the paramagnetism and diamagnetism are relatively weak . for the electron gas ,",
    "the diamagnetic part of the zero - field susceptibility is one - third ( in absolute value ) of the paramagnetic part , so altogether the gas is paramagnetic . for charged spinor bose gas , since both the paramagnetism and diamagnetism can be extremely large ,",
    "their competition is a more interesting problem .    in this paper , we study the competition between paramagnetism and diamagnetism of a charged spin-1 bose gas in external magnetic field . in section",
    "ii , a model consisting of both the landau diamagnetic effect and pauli paramagnetic effect is proposed .",
    "the total magnetization density as well as its paramagnetic and diamagnetic parts are calculated respectively .",

    ".    figures [ m ] demonstrate the total magnetic performance of the charged spin-1 bose gas .",
    "we now turn to examine the underlying paramagnetic and diamagnetic effects for each corresponding case . as shown in figs .",
    "[ mt ] , both the paramagnetization density and the diamagnetization density become more stronger at lower temperatures . as the external field",

    "this paper has studied the interplay between paramagnetism and diamagnetism of the ideal charged spin-1 bose gas .",
    "the lande - factor @xmath0 is introduced to describe the strength of paramagnetic effect caused by the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the gas exhibits a shift from diamagnetism to paramagnetism as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the critical value of @xmath0 , @xmath72 , is determined by evaluating the dimensionless magnetization density @xmath60 .",
    "our results show that @xmath72 increases monotonically as @xmath77 decreases . in the high temperature limit",

    "our results indicate that @xmath76 ranges from @xmath81 to @xmath82 as the magnetic field varies .",
    "therefore , a gas with @xmath1 exhibits diamagnetism at all temperatures , but a gas with @xmath2 always exhibits paramagnetism . in cases where @xmath105 , the bose gas undergoes a shift from paramagnetism to diamagnetism as the temperature decreases .    in order to depict some details of the competition between paramagnetism and diamagnetism , the paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions to the total magnetization density",
    "are also calculated .",
    "no doubt that the paramagnetism is enhanced with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "surprisingly , the diamagnetism is not suppressed , but slightly strengthen .",
    "this implies that the competition between para- and dia - magnetism is nontrivial .",
    "when @xmath0 is fixed , both the paramagnetism and diamagnetism become stronger as @xmath77 decreases .",
    "as in the scalar case , there is no bose - einstein condensation when the magnetic field is present , no matter how small it is .",
    "however , evidence of the condensation can be seen in the magnetization density as the magnetic field is reduced .    at last ,",
    "we briefly discuss experimental aspects possibly relevant to the present work .",
    "although the charged spinor bose gas has not been realized so far , the up - to - date achievement in experiments makes it attainable perhaps in the near future.@xcite for example , it is already possible to create ultracold plasmas by photoionization of laser - cooled neutron atoms.@xcite the ions can be regarded as charged bosons if their spin is an integer .",
    "the lande - factor for different magnetic ions could be different . as reported by killian _",
    "et al._@xcite , the temperatures of electrons and ions are as low as 100 mk and 10 @xmath29k , respectively .",
    "one can expect that the temperature could be lowered near to the bec temperature with new advancement in experimental techniques .",
    "the diamagnetism - paramagnetism effects manifest themselves near the bec point . on the other hand ,",
    "several ferromagnetic superconductors have been discovered since 2000.@xcite cooper pairs in such materials are likely in the spin - triplet state , thus behave somewhat like charged spin-1 bosons .",
