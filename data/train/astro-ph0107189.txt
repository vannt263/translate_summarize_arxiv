    "the determination of the pregalactic , or primordial , helium abundance by mass @xmath0 is paramount for the study of cosmology , the physics of elementary particles , and the chemical evolution of galaxies . in this paper",
    "we present a new determination of @xmath0 based on observations of the metal - poor extragalactic h   regions ngc  346 , i  zw  18 , ngc  2363 , haro  29 , and sbs  0335052 .",
    "this determination is compared with those carried out by other authors . a preliminary account on the results for i",
    "zw  18 and ngc  2363 is presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "there are three problems affecting the @xmath0 determination that need to be further analyzed : @xmath6 ) the temperature structure , @xmath7 ) the ionization structure , and @xmath8 ) the collisional excitation of the hydrogen lines .",
    "this paper will be mainly concerned with the effect of the temperature structure of the nebulae on the helium line intensities . in a future paper",
    "we will discuss in more detail the problem of the collisional excitation of the hydrogen lines @xcite .",
    "the most accurate @xmath0 values in the literature have been derived under the assumption of no contribution to the hydrogen balmer lines due to collisional excitation , we will refer to these determinations in this paper as @xmath0(nhc ) and to those that include the hydrogen collisional effect as @xmath0(+hc ) . due to the collisional contribution to the balmer line intensities the @xmath0(nhc )",
    "determinations are lower limits to the @xmath0(+hc ) value .",
    "there are several pieces of evidence indicating that @xmath1(he  ) is smaller than @xmath1(o  ): @xmath6 ) observations of ngc  346 [ hereinafter paper  i ] pei00z , @xmath7 ) photoionization models of giant extragalactic h   regions @xcite , @xmath8 ) in photoionization models @xmath1(o  ) is smaller than @xmath1(o  ) for objects with @xmath1(o  ) higher than 12,360  k @xcite , and a considerable fraction of the he   lines originates in the o@xmath3 zone .",
    "this small difference is significative because it lowers the he@xmath3/h@xmath3 determination . by combining the",
    "observed he   lines it is found that @xmath1(he  ) and @xmath9(he  ) are coupled in the sense that a lower @xmath1 implies a higher @xmath9 reducing the he@xmath3/h@xmath3 determination ( see paper  i ) .",
    "another problem that has to be considered to determine very accurate he / h values of a given h   region is its ionization structure .",
    "the total he / h value is given by :    @xmath10    for objects of low degree of ionization it is necessary to consider the presence of he@xmath11 inside the h@xmath3 zone , while for objects of high degree of ionization it is necessary to consider the possible presence of h@xmath11 inside the he@xmath3 zone .",
    "for objects of low degree of ionization @xmath12 might be larger than 1.00 , while for objects of high degree of ionization @xmath13 might be smaller than 1.00 .",

    "each h   region is different and a good photoionization model is needed to estimate an @xmath12 of very high accuracy . in this paper",
    "we will assume that the h   regions are chemically homogeneous .",
    "in section 2 we will adapt the @xmath14 and @xmath15 formalism introduced by @xcite to relate @xmath1(o  ) and @xmath1(o  ) with @xmath1(he  ) , the full mathematical treatment is presented in the appendix . in section 3",
    "we will rediscuss the @xmath16 determination of ngc 346 , the most luminous h   region in the smc , carried out in paper  i. in sections 4 to 7 we redetermine the he@xmath3/h@xmath3 values for i  zw  18 , ngc  2363 , haro  29 , and sbs  0335052 , based on the observations of @xcite and @xcite and on photoionization models for these objects .",
    "these four objects were selected from their sample based on the following criteria : the two objects with the lowest heavy element abundances and the two objects with the smallest observational errors @xcite .",
    "we derive he@xmath3/h@xmath3 , @xmath9(he  ) , @xmath1(he  ) , and @xmath17(3889 ) self - consistently based on all the observed he   line intensities , with the exception of those strongly affected by underlying absorption . by combining the he@xmath3/h@xmath3 values of these four objects with that of ngc 346",
    "we derive a new @xmath0(nhc ) in section 8 .",
    "the collisional contribution to the balmer lines is estimated in section 9 .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are presented in sections 10 and 11 .",
    "we first consider an h   region where the he  , the o  , and the h   volumes coincide perfectly . if we further assume that the temperature is constant we have a very simple model which gives us a first approximation to a real nebula .",
    "if we now assume that the h   region has an average temperature given by @xmath18 and a mean square temperature variation given by : @xmath19 we find that the observed @xmath1(4363/5007 ) , derived from the @xmath20(4363)/@xmath20(5007 ) ratio , is given by @xcite : @xmath21 \\frac{t^2}{2 } \\right ) \\label{eto3-t0 } , \\ ] ] and that the temperature associated to the he   recombination lines , that originate in the he   region , is ( see paper  i ) : @xmath22 this means that the temperature that should be used to measure the helium abundance is given by : @xmath23      \\frac{t^2}{2}\\right ) \\label{ethe2-to3 } .\\ ] ]    in figure  [ fto3-the ] , and based on equation  [ ethe2-to3 ] , we present @xmath1(he  ) /@xmath1(o  ) versus @xmath14 for different values of @xmath1(o  ) .",
    "we consider now another h   region where the he   volume coincides with the h   volume , but now oxygen is present both in the form of o@xmath2 and o@xmath3 , with the o@xmath3 weight described by the fraction @xmath24 :    @xmath25    if the average temperatures in the o   and o   zones are given by : @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , then the average temperature for the whole ionized region @xmath15 is equal to @xmath28 the fractional difference between @xmath29 and @xmath15 can thus be characterized by the parameter @xmath30 so that @xmath31 and the ratio between @xmath32 and @xmath15 is : @xmath33    in the general case when the o   and o   zones are not of uniform temperature , but include temperature fluctuations , represented by : @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , the mean square temperature fluctuation for the entire h   region , @xmath14 , is given by : @xmath36 were the first two terms represent the deviation from uniform temperature given by the difference in temperature between each zone and the average for the whole h   region , while the other two represent the additional contribution due to inhomogeneities in each zone .    substituting the first 2 terms with equations [ ebeta_2 ] and [ ebeta_1 ] and by keeping the last 2 terms to second order we obtain : @xmath37 @xmath29 and @xmath38",

    "however , it can be shown ( see appendix ) that , the simple average of the temperatures weighted by @xmath24 and @xmath46 does not give an equation accurate to second order and that @xmath47 needs a factor @xmath48 of the form : @xmath49\\gamma \\label{eto2 + 3def1 } , \\ ] ] @xmath48 is very close to unity for objects where @xmath50 or where @xmath1(o  ) is similar to @xmath1(o  ) ( @xmath51 ) ; but for h   regions where there are appreciable fractions of both o@xmath3 and o@xmath2 and where there is an appreciable difference between @xmath1(o  ) and @xmath1(o  ) , @xmath48 must be calculated as described in the appendix .",
