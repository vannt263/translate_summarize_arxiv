    "observation of a non - zero value for @xmath0 opens the door for a measurement of cp violation in the lepton sector and the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "several experiments are expected to reveal more information on this angle in near future reactor @xcite and mid term accelerator @xcite experiments .",
    "an extensive program is required to study neutrino oscillations beyond the scope of these experiments .",
    "a joint study between brookhaven national lab ( bnl ) and fermi national accelerator lab ( fnal ) was organized to investigate the potential of a very long baseline experiment in the united states .",
    "the conclusions of this elaborate effort are discussed in @xcite , wherein references to supporting documentation can be found ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "most calculations were performed using the globes @xcite software package .",
    "the basis for the inputs will be described in the next sections , after which the results will be discussed .",
    "one possibility is to use the existing numi beamline and place a detector at 810 km about @xmath1 off - axis .",
    "simulations of the expected spectra are base upon gnumi which is well tested against experimental data @xcite .",
    "the same monte carlo is used simulate the wide band low energy ( wble ) beam with a few modifications : a new design for the horns and a 400 m long , 4 m diameter decay pipe .",
    "incident proton energies of 120 gev were preferred over lower energy beams due to a higher total neutrino yield .",
    "the beam has been tilted slightly off - axis by @xmath2 to maintain a large fraction of the low energy flux but to suppress the high energy tail .",
    "results quoted use this configuration , although calculations were also performed for other options in this study .",
    "the default assumes a total of @xmath3 protons - on - target ( pot ) are delivered to produce above mentioned beams , divided equally among the neutrino and anti - neutrino running mode .",
    "various baseline lengths were considered for the wble beam but only results for 1300 km will be shown .",
    "this is the distance from fnal to the homestake mine , which recently was singled out as the candidate for a deep underground science and engineering laboratory .",
    "a comparison is made between two detector technologies : the well established water cherenkov ( wch ) technique on the one hand , and a liquid argon ( lar ) detector on the other hand .",
    "the parametrization of the detector responses used as input for the sensitivity calculations are described in this section .",
    "the detector performance is based on the elaborate work performed to reduce the contamination from nc interactions in the @xmath4 selection procedure using superk monte carlo events @xcite .",
    "quantities obtained from a significantly improved @xmath5 finding algorithm are combined with other variables in a likelihood based selection method .",
    "this increases the signal - to - background ratio drastically in addition to the standard superk cuts to select single ring electron - like events inside the fiducial volume .",
    "the efficiencies used for the calculations reported here are matched to these results .",
    "an independent group confirmed these findings using similar techniques @xcite .",
    "the energy smearing function for @xmath4 signal events is based on a geant3 @xcite simulation of quasi - elastic interactions and is about @xmath6 at 1  gev .",
    "it is in very good agreement with the results from the two studies mentioned above , except for missing asymmetric tails due to non - quasi elastic events .",
    "however , this is shown to have a small effect on the final result @xcite .",
    "the resolution functions for nc interactions are based on the nuance monte carlo program @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the expected spectrum using a 300  kton fiducial volume water cherenkov detector .",
    "a liquid argon detector is often considered as the best possible neutrino detector due to a fully active calorimetric medium with fine grained tracking capabilities .",
    "this should allow for a high signal selection efficiency while practically eliminating all neutral current backgrounds .",
    "based on a hand scanning study @xcite , the selection efficiency for charged current @xmath4 interactions is taken as @xmath7 with a complete rejection of nc background events .",
    "the energy resolution for quasi - elastic events is assumed to be @xmath8 , while this is @xmath9 for all other type of interactions .",
    "the fiducial mass of the lar detector under consideration is 100 kton .",
    "three limits as a function of true @xmath10  and @xmath11  are derived for each experimental variation : sensitivity to a non - zero @xmath12 , cp violation and resolving the mass hierarchy .",
    "when single value limits are quoted , this corresponds to the value of @xmath12above which the sensitivity is better than the quoted confidence level for @xmath13 of the @xmath11  phase space . for a limited set of @xmath14 combinations , the ability to measure these values is also explored .",
    "correlations between oscillation parameters are taken into account .",
    "the values of the atmospheric mixing parameters were chosen to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with the error determined from the @xmath17 disappearance channel .",
    "the solar parameters are set to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , both with an error of @xmath20 .",
    "the error on the matter density is taken to be @xmath20 , while the error on the background is assumed to be @xmath21 .",
    "the obtained limits for each experiment described above are listed in table  [ tab : sens ] .",
    "the overall best performance is obtained with a lar detector placed in the wble beam .",
    "when placed in the numi off - axis beam , the sensitivity to cp violation is still good , but the ability to determine the mass hierarchy is much worse .",
    "the wch detector performs good for all three hypotheses tested .",
    ".sensitivities to a non - zero @xmath10 , cp violation and the mass hierarchy at the @xmath22 level for a wch detector in the wble beam ( wch - w ) , a lar detector in the wble ( lar - w ) and numi off - axis beam ( lar - n ) .",
    "limits are obtained after a total exposure of @xmath3 pot equally divided among @xmath23  and @xmath24  running . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "details of the sensitivity calculations performed in the scope of the joint fnal - bnl u.s .",
    "long baseline neutrino experiment study were discussed .",
    "the best limits for the same exposure are obtained using a 100  kton lar detector in the wble beam .",
    "placing this detector off - axis in the numi beam reduces the sensitivity to the mass hierarchy significantly .",
    "the 300  kton wch detector placed at the dusel candidate site has a good overall performance .",
    "it was also shown that this detector is not limited by background systematics if controlled to better than @xmath20 .",
    "i am grateful to brookhaven national laboratory for supporting the work presented .",
