    "indirect searches are those where new physics is identified by comparing nusong measurements to those from other experiments . as one example , the eoi describes precision measurement of the nc couplings , which , when compared with the lep invisible @xmath9-width measurements , can open a unique window on new physics . here",
    "we consider the `` classic example '' for neutrino scattering  comparison of electroweak measurements of @xmath10 .    at present , a 3@xmath11 deviation is observed between measurement of @xmath10 in neutrino dis scattering from nutev @xcite and the lep / sld e@xmath12e@xmath13 results @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is consistent with past measurements from neutrino experiments , which show a systematic shift from the standard model .",
    "however the small errors of nutev make this result much more significant .",
    "the nutev electroweak measurement was presented at nufact07 by kevin mcfarland , and will be described in detail in his contribution to these proceedings .",
    "nusong will measure @xmath14 in two ways : through the ratio of @xmath15-electron elastic scattering ( @xmath5ees ) to imd events and through the paschos - wolfenstein ( pw ) technique which exploits ratios of dis nc and cc scattering .",
    "the former technique , which has the virtue of being a purely leptonic measurement , is new .",
    "past neutrino - electron scattering experiments measuring @xmath10 have been at low energies and thus could not normalize to imd .",
    "the latter technique was employed by nutev .",
    "nusong expects to improve on the experimental errors which were published by nutev by about a factor of two @xcite , with much of this improvement coming from the increased statistics .",
    "nusong will also be able to address the two most viable `` standard model '' explanations of the nutev anomaly : the strange sea asymmetry and isospin violation @xcite .",
    "the strange sea asymmetry will be constrained by accurate measurement of dimuon production in @xmath5 and @xmath6 running modes , as well as an _ in - situ _ emulsion - based measurement of the semi - leptonic branching ratio to charm .",
    "the level of isospin violation can be constrained by the high - statistics measurement of @xmath16 ( discussed below ) .",
    "the nusong experiment provides complementary information to lhc . rather than generalize , to illustrate the power of nusong , two specific examples are given here .",
    "we emphasize that these are just two of a wide range of examples , but they serve well to demonstrate the point .",
    "first , consider a heavy @xmath17 which is in the @xmath18 family  a case of interest because this is an anomaly free extension of the standard model @xcite .",
    "we will consider a 3 tev @xmath17 which couples to @xmath19 .",
    "this is one explanation of the nutev anomaly @xcite . in this case",
    ", the lhc will see @xmath20 channel , and measure and @xmath21 , but not the width , due to resolution",
    ". the absence of the @xmath22 channel will be clear but absence of the @xmath23 channel will only be surmised after very high statistics are obtained . among the quark channels ,",
    "the one which is reconstructable is @xmath24 . in this scenario",
    ", nusong would find that isopin and the strange sea can be constrained to the point that they do not provide an explanation for the nutev anomaly , thus nutev is the result of new physics .",
    "the nusong pw measurement of @xmath10 will agree with nutev , and the @xmath5ees measurement will agree with lep .",
    "[ fig : nusongew](left ) illustrates this example .",
    "the complementary information from nusong is needed to narrow the options to the @xmath19 coupling .",
    "a second example is the existence of a fourth generation family .",
    "a fourth family with non - degenerate masses ( _ i.e. _ isospin violating ) are allowed within the lep / sld constraints @xcite . as a model ,",
    "we choose a fourth family with mass splitting on the order of @xmath25 gev and a 300 gev higgs .",
    "this is consistent with lep at 1@xmath11 and perfectly consistent with @xmath26 , describing the point ( 0.2,0.19 ) on the st plot@xcite . in this scenario",
    ", lhc will measure the higgs mass from the highly enhanced @xmath27 decay @xcite .",
    "an array of exotic decays which will be difficult to fully reconstruct , such as production of 6 w s and 2 b s , will be observed at low rates .",
    "the expected nusong result in this scenario is that the strange sea or isospin violation will explain the nutev anomaly , and that the corrected nutev pw result will agree with the nusong pw and @xmath5ees measurements .",
    "these three precision neutrino results , all with `` lep - size '' errors , can be combined and will intersect the one - sigma edge of the lep measurements .",
    "[ fig : nusongew](right ) illustrates this example . from this , the source , a fourth generation with isospin violation , can be demonstrated .      which couples via @xmath19 ; right : nusong expectation if the nutev anomaly is due to either isospin violation or a strange sea asymmetry , and there is a heavy 4th generation with isospin violation.,title=\"fig:\",width=216 ]",
    "nusong is also designed to perform a range of direct searches for new physics .",
    "the segmented detector design , which was driven by the need to bring a calibration beam into each segment of the detector , also allows for a decay region in which one can search for decays of neutral heavy leptons in the mass ranges of a 10 s of mev to multi - gev .",
    "the design of the detector also allows for direct searches for new physics through neutrino interactions in the detector which are outside of the sm prediction .",
    "two examples of this , which are considered here in detail , are wrong - sign inverse muon decay and observation of an excess of very high energy @xmath28 interactions .    in considering the list of processes which nusong can observe ( see above ) , `` wrong - sign imd '' ( wsimd )",
    "was explicitly listed as resulting in zero events . in the standard model ,",
    "the interaction @xmath29 can not occur , since it violates lepton family number conservation ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "a number of theories beyond the standard model predict that lepton flavor number is not a true conserved quantum number ; this means that processes that violate lepton flavor are allowed to occur .",
    "theories which incorporate multiplicative lepton number conservation  @xcite , left - right symmetry  @xcite , or the existence of bileptons  @xcite fall under this category .    in principle , the observation of a single muon with no hadronic energy in antineutrino mode is a direct signature of new physics . in practice",
    "there are backgrounds from @xmath15 contamination in the @xmath31 beam , @xmath28 contamination and charge misidentification of candidate muons . with these backgrounds in mind , nusong is designed to improve the limit on wsimd by an order of magnitude from the present level@xcite . if we assume a conservative knowledge of the backgrounds at the 5% level , this would imply a limit on the lepton number violation cross - section ratio of better than 0.2% ( at 90% c.l . ) for v - a couplings and less than 0.06% for scalar couplings .",
    "previous searches , based on @xmath32 protons on target and smaller target masses , have placed limits on this cross - section ratio to less than 1.7% at 90% c.l . for v - a couplings and less than 0.6% for scalar couplings  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the best argument for searching for new lepton flavor violating effects arises from the experimental observation of neutrino oscillations , which explicitly violates lepton flavor .",
    "this describes the conversion of neutrino flavors as a function of time via a @xmath33 mixing matrix . in most analyses ,",
    "this matrix is assumed to be unitary .",
    "however new physics at high energy scaales can induce nonunitarity in this matrix .",
    "nonunitarity , or `` matrix freedom , '' introduces striking changes to the probability formula for neutrino flavor transitions .",
    "the level at which unitarity is violated can be defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 with @xmath34 being small .",
    "one of the main consequences of such a scenario is instantaneous ( @xmath360 ) flavor transitions in a neutrino beam . extending the argument of ref .",
    "@xcite , the non - orthogonality of @xmath37 and @xmath28 results in an instantaneous transition at @xmath38 from @xmath15 to @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "thus one could observe an excess of @xmath28 events in a pure @xmath37 beam .",
    "similarly , a @xmath31 to @xmath39 transition at @xmath38 , then a subsequent @xmath40 interaction will produce a wsimd signal in nusong .    from @xcite ,",
    "the limits on @xmath41 instantaneous transition are at the @xmath42 level , and arise from physics above the ew scale which would be apparent in corrections to decay rates .",
    "this is at the edge of nusong capability , but may be observable depending on the control of the systematics .",
    "however , these limits are not applicable if the nonunitarity arises due to an effect such as the existence of a `` neutrissimo ''  a @xmath43 gev neutral heavy lepton  which mixes with the light neutrinos and thereby affects the apparent coupling . in this case",
    ", nusong has substantial allowed range for its search .",
    "note that this wsimd signature can only be observed in a high energy beam such as at nusong because the threshold for muon production is 12 gev .",
    "an alternative method to search for this effect is to look for @xmath28 appearance in an energy range with low , and well - constrained , intrinsic @xmath28 background . in the case of nusong , this is on the high energy tail of the flux , above @xmath44 gev .",
    "for the @xmath42 level limit on @xmath15 transformation to @xmath28 quoted in @xcite , nusong would see an excess of @xmath45 @xmath28 events in this high energy region and a 10% increase in flux for e@xmath46 gev . in that region ,",
    "the @xmath28 flux is mainly from @xmath47 decay , which is well constrained by the @xmath47-produced @xmath15 events .",
    "such an excess should therefore be straightforward to observe .",
    "an observation of this excess in both this mode and as wsimd would be a very striking signature for this effect .",
    "nusong also will study parton distributions and nuclear effects to high precision .",
    "comparison of our resut to the charged lepton scattering data can provide clues to the sources of the major features which appear in nuclear effects : shadowing , antishadowing , and the emc effect .",
    "present data suggest nuclear corrections for the @xmath48 cross sections which differ from expectation  @xcite . in order to investigate this , nusong will include targets of c , al , fe , and pb , as well as sio@xmath49 .",
    "this study will complement results of miner@xmath5a and of erhic .",
    "the high statistics and isoscalarity allows measurement of structure function combinations which are so - far poorly constrained . among these is the precision measurement of @xmath50 , which provides sensitivity to isospin violation .",
    "the sensitivity arises from residual @xmath51-contributions .",
    "the effect is amplified compared to the @xmath52 and @xmath53 contributions because @xmath54 transitions are not subject to slow - rescaling corrections which strongly suppress the @xmath55 contribution to @xmath56 .",
    "the ability of nusong to separately measure @xmath57 and @xmath58 over a broad kinematic range , and with better high-@xmath59 acceptance than nutev / ccfr , will provide powerful constraints on the sensitive structure function combination @xmath60 .",
    "these proceedings have covered some highlights of the measurements which could be made at a new high - statistics , high - energy neutrino scattering experiment , called nusong .",
    "the goal is to obtain a high statistics sample of well reconstructed @xmath15 electron scatters , as well as @xmath5dis events , leading to physics opportunities in the area of electroweak precision measurement , direct searches and qcd studies .",
