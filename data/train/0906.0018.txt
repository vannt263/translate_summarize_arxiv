    "according to the current galaxy formation paradigm , galaxies should be embedded in massive dark matter haloes ( e.g. kauffmann & van den bosch 2002 ; springel et al .",
    "2005 ) . for spiral galaxies ,",
    "these haloes have indeed been observationally confirmed , by determining their influence on the kinematics of the hi  discs that surround most of these galaxies ( see e.g. van albada et al .",
    "early - type galaxies often lack these large gas discs , and therefore their dark matter haloes are more difficult to probe .",
    "although some early - type galaxies do have regular hi  structures that have been used to identify a dark matter halo ( e.g. bertola et al . 1993 ; franx , van gorkom & de zeeuw 1994 ; oosterloo et al .",
    "2002 ; weijmans et al . 2008 ) and recent sensitive radio observations have shown that hi  in these galaxies is more common than previously thought ( e.g. morganti et al .",
    "2006 ) , for the majority of early - type galaxies we need to employ other tracers to determine the dark matter content .",
    "stellar kinematics are a reliable tracer of the gravitational potential in galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , traditional long - slit spectroscopy seldom reaches beyond two half - light or effective radii ( @xmath0 ) , because the necessary signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath4 ) is difficult to achieve in this regime . in the central parts of galaxies",
    "this is not an issue , and it has been shown by various studies that in early - type galaxies within one @xmath0 the luminous matter still dominates over the dark matter : only 10 - 50 per cent of the total mass is dark ( gerhard et al .",
    "2001 ; cappellari et al .",
    "2006 ; thomas et al .",
    "these data however do not cover the outer regions of galaxies , where the dark matter is supposed to dominate .",
    "models of early - type galaxies based on long - slit stellar kinematics extending to larger radii are not always conclusive , but indicate that a dark halo is required in some individual cases ( e.g. carollo et al . 1995 ; rix et al .",
    "1997 ) .    to probe the gravitational potential at larger radii ( outside one @xmath0 )",
    ", we can resort to gravitational lensing ( e.g. koopmans et al .",
    "2006 ; gavazzi et al .",
    "2007 ) , x - ray emission ( e.g. osullivan & ponman 2004 ; humphrey et al . 2006 ) or discrete tracers such as globular clusters ( e.g. ct et al . 2003 ; bridges et al . 2006 ) or planetary nebulae ( e.g. romanowsky et al .",

    "interestingly , romanowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that models of their sample of three intermediate luminosity early - type galaxies only required a small amount of dark matter , if any at all .",
    "dekel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) subsequently argued that the observed kinematics of the planetary nebulae ( pne ) could also be explained by invoking radial anisotropy , and therefore do not exclude a dark halo ( see also binney & mamon 1982 ) .",
    "douglas et al .",
    "( 2007 ) presented newly reduced pne kinematics for one of the galaxies of the romanowksy et al .",
    "sample ( ngc  3379 ) and found the dark matter fraction within 5 @xmath0 to be less than 40 per cent , which is significantly lower than what is predicted by @xmath5cdm models .",
    "napolitano et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reached similar conclusions modeling pne kinematics in the elliptical galaxy ngc  4494 and suggested that intermediate - luminosity galaxies are surrounded by low concentration haloes , while some high - mass ellipticals could have more strongly concentrated haloes . de lorenzi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) presented mass models of ngc  3379 based on the pne kinematics of douglas et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , combined with long - slit and central sauron integral - field data , and concluded that they can fit the data with a range of mass distributions , depending on the anisotropy .",
    "they did not exclude a dark matter halo with a strong radially anisotropic outer envelope , that is still consistent with merger models within the @xmath5cdm paradigm .",
    "we observed two of the galaxies of the romanowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) sample , ngc  3379 and ngc  821 , with the sauron integral - field unit ( ifu ) , to measure the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) at large radii ( 3 - 4 @xmath0 ) .",
    "we took advantage of the high throughput and large field - of - view of sauron ( 41 @xmath6 33 arcsec@xmath7 ) and used the ifu as a `` photon collector '' : for each observation we co - added all spectra within one field to acquire enough @xmath4 to measure the losvd up to the fourth gauss - hermite moment @xmath8 .",
    "these higher order moments are key to breaking the mass - anisotropy degeneracy when constructing mass models and determining the dark matter content of galaxies ( e.g. gerhard 1993 ) .",
    "apart from the losvd , we also obtained line strengths from our spectra , allowing us to study line strength gradients out to large radii and constraining the properties of the stellar halo populations .",
    "both ngc  3379 and ngc  821 are well studied galaxies , and some of their properties are summarized in table  [ tab : gal ] .",

    "at larger radii the radial anisotropy increases , and the increase is smaller for models with heavier haloes .",
    "this is contrary to what is seen in spherical models . in order to fit",
    "the observed mildly declining or constant velocity dispersion profile without invoking extra dark matter at large radii , the orbits have to be tangentially anisotropic , while adding a dark halo results in more radially anisotropic orbits ( e.g. richstone & tremaine 1984 ; dekel et al . 2005 ; de lorenzi et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the detailed kinematics in the inner part of the galaxy together with our observed positive @xmath8 in the outer parts already tightly constrain the fraction of box and tube orbits in our triaxial potential , and therefore the anisotropy .",
    "box orbits have no net rotation , and contribute to the radial anisotropy of the system , requiring @xmath9 . for tube orbits to reproduce the observed nearly zero mean rotation at large radii",
    ", they have to be counter - rotating , increasing the velocity dispersion .",
    "however , they would at the same time increase the tangential anisotropy and therefore yield @xmath10 .",
    "since we observe a positive @xmath8 at large radii , box orbits are expected to contribute significantly to the orbital structure in our models without dark matter , as confirmed in figure  [ fig : aniso ] . as a result ,",
    "the models without dark halo are strongly radial anisotropic at large radii . adding a spherical dark matter halo to the system",
    "makes the gravitational potential less triaxial .",
    "this will decrease the phase space volume of box orbits and naturally results in a larger population of tube orbits ( hunter & de zeeuw 1992 ) .",
    "the radial anisotropy of the system will decrease , as is illustrated in figure  [ fig : aniso ] .",
    "this decrease is more pronounced in ngc  821 than in ngc  3379 , since our best - fit model of ngc  821 is more dark matter dominated than our ngc  3379 model .",
    "we here investigate the connection between the stellar populations and the mass distribution of the galaxy .",
    "franx & illingworth ( 1990 ) showed that there is a tight relation between the local colour ( tracing metallicity ) and the local escape velocity @xmath3  ( tracing the gravitational potential @xmath11 ) in early - type galaxies , with @xmath3  given by :    @xmath12    this relation was confirmed by davies et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , who used mg2  as a tracer for metallicity .",
    "scott et al . ( 2009 ) find correlations between line strength indices and @xmath3  for the early - type galaxies in the sauron sample , based on measurements within @xmath11 @xmath0 .",
    "they also show that for mg@xmath2  this relation does not only hold locally in one galaxy , but is also a global relation between different galaxies .    with our data at large radii",
    "we can now investigate the behaviour of this relation out to 4 @xmath0 .",
    "we determine for our best - fit model of ngc  3379 the contribution to the gravitational potential of the dark halo using equation  [ eq : nfwpot ] .",
    "the contribution of the stellar mass is inferred from the mge model , following the formularium in the appendix of cappellari et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and the black hole is included as a plummer potential .",
    "we plot our result in figure  [ fig : vesc ] , and find that the observed relation within 1 @xmath0 continues out to at least 4 @xmath0 .",
    "the influence of the dark halo on the mg@xmath2  - @xmath3  relation becomes clear when comparing our results to a model without a dark halo , where the only contribution to the potential comes from the mge model and the black hole ( open symbols in figure  [ fig : vesc ] ) .",
    "not only is there an offset in @xmath3  with respect to the model with the dark halo , but also the slope changes , an effect which was also noted by franx & illingworth ( 1990 ) .",
    "the addition of extra mass at larger radii by the dark halo deepens the potential well , which means that even particles in the centre of the galaxy will need a larger @xmath3  to climb out of this well , causing a shift in @xmath3at all radii .",
    "however , particles in the outskirts of the galaxy are relatively more affected by the addition of the dark halo than particles in the more central regions : if the halo had not been present , escaping from the potential well at large radii would have been relatively easy . therefore , the shift in @xmath3  is larger at larger radii , something that is also illustrated by figure  [ fig : vesc ] .",
    "the net result is a change in slope .",
    "we find that the slope of the mg@xmath2  - @xmath3  relation in ngc  3379 changes in logscale from 0.31 to 0.46 , when taking the dark halo into account .",
    "if instead of considering the infinite halo mass of the nfw profile we only take the contribution of the halo within @xmath13 into account when calculating the gravitational potential , the slope becomes 0.43 in logscale .",
    "we note that in both the models with and without halo , there is a _ local _ relation between mg@xmath2  and @xmath3",
    ". however , when looking at a larger sample of galaxies and studying the _ global _",
    "mg@xmath2  - @xmath3relation the contribution of the halo to the potential should be taken into account to interpret the slopes , since the relative contribution of the dark matter to the potential compared to the luminous one may vary from galaxy to galaxy , e.g. depending on galaxy mass or environment .",
    "we used the sauron ifu as a `` photon collector '' to obtain stellar absorption line kinematics and line strengths out to four effective radii in the early - type galaxies ngc  3379 and ngc  821 .",
    "by co - adding the individual spectra of each lenslet into one spectrum for each observed field , we were able to obtain sufficient signal - to - noise in the outskirts of these galaxies , which are too faint to observe with traditional long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "the stellar velocity profiles are measured up to the fourth gauss - hermite moment ( @xmath8 ) , which allows us to break the mass - anisotropy degeneracy when constructing dynamical models of our galaxies .",
    "the kinematics show a smooth continuation of the profiles measured within 1 - 2 @xmath0 with sauron and long - slit spectroscopy , and are consistent with planetary nebulae kinematics .",
    "the line strengths also show a continuation of the gradients observed within 1 @xmath0 , although our fe5015 measurements probably suffer from variations in the continuum shape .",
    "the stellar halo population is old and metal - poor .",
    "the continuation of the line strength gradients and the mg@xmath2  - @xmath3  relation out to at least 4 @xmath0 provides constraints for the star formation and merger history of early - type galaxies ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "2009a ; hopkins et al .",
    "2009b ; spolaor et al .",
    "2009 ) .    constructing dynamical orbit - based models ,",
    "we show that even assuming a maximal stellar contribution , both ngc  3379 and ngc  821 require a dark halo to fit the observed kinematics .",
    "we parametrised the halo contribution with a spherical nfw profile , fixing the concentration to @xmath14 .",
    "we therefore can not give a definite number for the precise mass content , shape and anisotropy of the halo .",
    "varying @xmath15 in our halo profile does not have a large effect on the fitted dark matter content , as an increase of @xmath15 will be accompanied by a decrease in @xmath16 , as the dynamical models constrain the density inside the region for which kinematics are available . only with data at even larger",
    "radii ( preferably out to @xmath1 100 @xmath0 , accessible with e.g. weak gravitational lensing or satellites ) we would be able to break the degeneracy between @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in that sense",
    ", our results should be viewed as an estimate of the minimal contribution of the dark halo to the total mass budget in the galaxy , and we then see that even at small radii ( within 1 @xmath0 ) , the dark matter is already responsible for 10 - 20 per cent of the total mass .",
    "these percentages will increase if we relax the minimal halo assumption , but we then need reliable measurements of the stellar mass - to - light ratio and its potential variation with radius . with better spatial coverage of the galaxy ,",
    "either by mosaicing or by employing larger ifus ( such as virus - p and in the future muse ) and combining the so - obtained stellar kinematics with other datasets tracing dark matter at different regimes ( e.g. hi  discs or rings , hot gas , gravitational lensing and/or discrete tracers such as planetary nebulae ) we will be able to build more sophisticated dynamical models , to explore the shape and mass of the dark haloes around early - type galaxies .",
