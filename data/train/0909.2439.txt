    "rpm s are mechanics models with no absolute notions of time , position , orientation , and , in the case of the present paper , scale , so that one has a dynamics of pure shape .",
    "such characteristics motivate rpm s as whole - universe models for e.g. the problem of time in quantum gravity @xcite and other foundational issues in quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "rpm s are , in more detail , relational in barbour s sense rather than rovelli s ( c.f . @xcite and the comparisons in @xcite . )",

    ". furthermore , general relativity ( gr )  in its guise as the geometrodynamics of 3-spaces that are compact without boundary  fits this mold , since it can be cast in terms of a jacobi - type action with the spatial 3-diffeomorphisms playing the role of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "rpm s can , moreover , at least in low dimensions , implement configurational relationalism instead by being directly constructed to be @xmath3-invariant @xcite ; this approach builds on work of kendall @xcite on the spaces of shapes and then considers the ` cones ' @xcite over these so as to include scale .    as further motivation for rpm s , their usefulness as models of quantum cosmology and of the problem of time in quantum gravity stem from a number of analogies between them and geometrodynamics . as well as the above mention of their parallel with gr at the level of relational actions , there are parallels at the level of configuration space ( see sec 2.2 ) and various parallels which minisuperspace ( a historically more studied toy model ) @xcite does not ( nontrivially ) possess .",
    "namely , 1 ) an important feature of gr is its linear momentum constraint , which causes a number of substantial complications e.g. in attempted resolutions of the problem of time @xcite .",

    "in this paper , i applied methods analogous to @xcite s for the 4-stop metroland rpm to improve @xcite s understanding of the triangleland rpm ( both of these rpm s having @xmath4 shape spaces , albeit with big differences in the physical interpretation of each ) .",
    "two of these methods are    \\a ) tessellation of the shape sphere by the corresponding physical interpretation . for triangleland ,",
    "this has double collision points , equilateral points , an equator of collinearity and meridians of isoscelesness and rightness .",

    "however for triangleland they are a less trivial hopf / dragt realization .",
    "i furthermore interpret the ensuing three dragt - type coordinates as the following shape quantities .",
    "i ) aniso , a measure of anisoscelesness with respect to a given clustering that assigns which particles are to be the apex and base ) .",
    "ii ) ellip , the ellipticity of the moments of inertia with respect to a given clustering .",
    "iii ) tetraarea , a quantity proportional to the area of the triangle , and which is in some senses deeper than the preceding though being clustering - independent alias a ` democratic invariant ' , of which 4-stop metroland has no counterpart .",
    "i promote these quantities at the quantum level to shape operators , which provides an ` expectations and spreads ' account of the wavefunctions that complements @xcite and sec 6 s ` modes and nodes ' account .",
    "moreover , i use not only @xcite s orbital basis centred about a particular clustering , and permutations thereof , but also the ` natural bases ' centred about the equilateral configurations , which are more natural in the absense of nontrivial potentials .",
    "i also consider the effect of a confining potential and provide a superior account of the nature of triangleland s conserved quantities .",
    "n.b . the mathematical analogy with the 2-sphere in space analogue makes it clear that the _ mathematics _",
    "underlying this paper is of a simple form that is very standard in qm . how this mathematics arises as a simple example of the more general machinery for quantizing quotient spaces",
    "is covered e.g. in @xcite .",
    "what is different from the usual in this paper is the _ subsequent interpretation _ of this standard mathematics in the hopf / dragt - type way that is appropriate for triangleland .",
    "moreover , this interpretation renders this simple ( and thus useable with all its additional well - known machinery ) mathematics so as to address , compare and combine further problem of time in quantum gravity strategies and quantum cosmological workings .",
    "pure - shape rpm s such as this paper s are more straightforward in a number of ways than rpm s that contain scale as well .",
    "however , it is scaled rpm s are more tightly analogous to standard classical and quantum cosmology ( and hidden time and emergent semiclassical time strategies for the problem of time ) , and so these are also under study @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to note that pure - shape rpm s occurs within scaled ones as a subproblem , so it makes good sense to study the pure - shape case first , with the present paper s results retaining their relevance for scaled rpm s .",
    "the free solutions studied in this paper and @xcite have the further value of supporting a technically straightforward ( wigner 3j symbol @xcite ) perturbation theory thereabout , allowing for treatment of more complicated potential terms , provided that they are small . in the emergent semiclassical approach setting , scaled triangleland @xcite is a toy model of    the halliwell  hawking approach to the study of the quantum cosmological origin of small inhomogeneity ( shape ) perturbations in gr cosmology .",
    "this paper s tessellation is useful for characterization of regions in which various semiclassical approaches work @xcite .",
    "triangleland is also a model for the internal time @xcite , histories theory @xcite and timeless records theory @xcite approaches to the problem of time ( this paper s nave schrdinger inerpretation is a simpler timeless approach ) .",
    "triangleland is , furthermore , simple enough that many of these will be solvable , comparable and combineable ( e.g. @xcite express great interest in such combinations ) .",
    "some such applications may benefit from extending the modelling from 4-stop metroland and triangleland to quadrilateralland ( for which @xcite is the counterpart of the present paper as regards shape quantities ) .",
    "i end with 2 quantum cosmological applications that this paper makes contact with .",
    "\\1 ) a further difference between this paper s models and ( at least many of ) their molecular physics analogues is at the level of which ` multiverses ' correspond to each .",
    "( for molecular physics models the corresponding multiverse can be thought of as a collection of laboratory setups with different parameter values ; multiverses in the rpm context are at least aesthetically more appealing in distancing themselves from copenhagen interpretation connotations . ) in particular , the triangleland ho problem has many mathematical parallels with the stark effect for the linear rigid rotor @xcite .",
    "however , in the latter , the electric field can point in any 3-@xmath0 direction , while in the former , the corresponding direction favoured by the potential can not be rotated out of the collinearity plane .",
    "moreover , the triangleland version has not 1 but 3 dm axes of particular physical significance within this plane ( fig 2b ) .",
    "thus each of these problems is set in a different ` multiverse ' .",
    "\\2 ) whether uniform states are probable ( see e.g. @xcite ) is of considerable interest in quantum cosmology  and cosmology in general  due to our actual universe being fairly uniform and expected to have emerged from an extremely uniform state .",
    "triangleland s most uniform states are equilateral triangles ; the natural basis new to this paper is then useful for studying propositions about these ; @xmath250-caps about the poles ( fig 2d ) in this basis represent approximately uniform states   @xmath250-equilateral states . additionally , ( approximate ) collinearity can be seen as the opposite of this [ and both of these are quantifiable in terms of tetraarea , which is minimal in size for collinearity and maximal for the equilateral configurations : @xmath250-equilateral corresponds to tetraarea lying between 1 and 1  @xmath251 for @xmath250 small ( @xmath252 ) ] . for this paper s",
    "very special ho case , going through the @xmath253 sequence of wavefunction sequence leads to only a limited increase in peaking around the equilateral configurations so that the most uniform states  the two labellings of the equilateral triangle are never overwelmingly the most probable states .",
    "furthermore , switching on the special or general ho potential draws the probability density away into a well that is not aligned with the equilateral configurations but rather within the collinearity plane .",
    "this paper further investigated these most and least uniform states via the nave schrdinger interpretation , by which i found that highly uniform states are not especially favoured , whilst the presence of a simple ho - like potential increases the probability of its opposite , near - collinearity .    *",
