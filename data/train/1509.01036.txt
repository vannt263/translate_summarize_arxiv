    "_ offset curves _ have been largely studied in the field of computer aided geometric design ( see @xcite for an overview on offset curves ) .",
    "these curves allow to give thickness to a thin object , and have been successfuly used in contexts like manufacturing , graphic design or robotics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , different theoretical aspects related to offset curves have been considered in the literature : algebraic properties @xcite , @xcite , topology @xcite , @xcite , parametrization @xcite , singularities @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or genus computation @xcite , @xcite , to give a non - exhaustive list of topics or papers . many of these papers focus on planar curves described by means of rational parametrizations , since this type of parametrizations is popular and widely used in cagd .    in the seminal paper @xcite , a method to find an implicit equation for the offset of a planar rational curve is given .",
    "this method , which we briefly summarize in section [ sec - prelim ] of this paper , requires to compute the resultant of two polynomials that are built from the parametrization .",
    "afterwards , in certain cases we need to remove an extraneous factor , whose components can be computed a priori .",
    "the resulting equation @xmath0 has at most two irreducible components @xcite , which can be of either _ simple _ or _ special _ nature , in the terminology of @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath0 can be written as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are irreducible polynomials , and @xmath3 is assumed to be constant in the case when the offset has just one component . however",
    ", no observation is made in the literature on the values of @xmath4 , i.e. on the multiplicity structure of @xmath0 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to fill this gap , thereby completing the description of the algebraic structure of the resultant giving rise to the offset of a rational curve .    in this paper",
    "we will see that the multiplicities @xmath4 can be computed in advance , and are related to two notions .",
    "the first one , which has already been mentioned in the preceding paragraph , is the simple or special nature of the corresponding offset component .",
    "the second one is the _ tracing index _ @xcite of the parametrization .",
    "essentially , the tracing index describes how many times a rational parametrization traces a given curve , or , in other words , how many times the parametrization traces a regular point of the curve . if the tracing index is 1 , then the parametrization is said to be _ proper _ ; this means that the degree of the parametrization is minimum . in this paper",
    "we prove that if the parametrization is proper then @xmath5 whenever there is no special component , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 whenever there is a special component ; in particular , if we have properness and there is no special component , then @xmath0 is square - free . when the parametrization has tracing index @xmath8 , we get @xmath9 if there is no special component , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 if there is a special component . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath0 is square - free iff the parametrization of the curve is proper , and the offset has no special component ( see corollary [ corfinal ] ) .",
    "the motivation for this paper came up while the authors were developing the results of @xcite , where the problem of computing the self intersections of an offset curve was studied . indeed , at a certain point in @xcite ( see remark 2 in @xcite ) it was necessary to study whether or not the polynomial @xmath0 was square - free . furthermore , as we show in this paper ( see theorem [ charact ] ) , the square - free character of @xmath0 also characterizes the situation when the offset has no special component , which is a necessary hypothesis , for instance , in @xcite and @xcite . in turn",
    "@xcite , this allows to recognize whether or not a given rational curve is the offset to another curve .",
    "the paper consists of two sections . in section [ sec - prelim ]",
    "we provide some preliminary definitions and results . in section [ sec - main ]",
    "we prove the theorems on the multiplicity structure of @xmath0 , and we illustrate them with some examples .",
    "let @xmath12 be a real , rational plane curve , not a line or a circle , parametrized by @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , are polynomials with rational coefficients and @xmath16 .",
    "it is well - known that the resultant provides the implicit equation of the curve . from theorem 4.41 in @xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a nonzero constant , @xmath19 is the implicit equation of @xmath12 , and @xmath20 is the _ tracing index _ of the parametrization @xmath21 , i.e. the number of times the parametrization @xmath21 covers a regular point @xmath22",
    ". the interested reader can check ",
    "1.6 @xcite for further reading on the notion of tracing index .",
    "additionally , we say that @xmath21 is _ proper _ iff it is birational , i.e. iff @xmath21 is injective except perhaps for finitely many values of the parameter @xmath23 ( corresponding to the self - intersections of the curve )",
    ". one can prove ( theorem 4.30 in @xcite ) that @xmath21 is proper iff the tracing index is 1 . since properness can always be achieved by reparametrizing the curve , if necessary @xcite , it is not uncommon to assume that one works with proper parametrizations .",
    "however , we do not need to make any a priori assumption on the properness of @xmath21 .    by reducing the components of @xmath21 to common denominator",
    ", we can write @xmath24 where @xmath25 . calling @xmath26 we define the _ offset _ to @xmath12 at distance @xmath27 , @xmath28 , as the _ zariski closure _ of the set of points @xmath29 , where @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "hence , @xmath29 implies that the euclidean distance between @xmath33 and the point @xmath34 , measured along the normal line to @xmath12 through @xmath35 , is @xmath36 ; in this situation , we say that @xmath35 _ generates _ @xmath37 . by an abuse of the language , we will also say that @xmath33 is generated by @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , when the first sign of @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the expression is considered , the geometrical locus described is called the _ exterior offset _ ; if the second sign is chosen , the geometrical locus described this way is called the _",
    "interior offset_. the union of the exterior and interior offsets is the whole offset , @xmath28 . in general",
    ", we will say that @xmath40 generates @xmath41 if @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the unitary normal vector to @xmath12 at @xmath44 . if @xmath45 is an affine point , which happens iff @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then @xmath48 gives rise to two points , which we denote by @xmath49 .",
    "the points @xmath50 also belong to @xmath28 .",
    "the computation of the implicit equation of @xmath28 is addressed in @xcite . in order to compute this equation ,",
    "the following polynomials are introduced : @xmath51 roughly speaking , the implicit equation of @xmath28 is found by eliminating the variable @xmath23 in the system formed by and .",
    "however , in order to avoid as many extraneous components as possible , we first divide @xmath52 , @xmath53 by their _ contents _ with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "be a polynomial in the variables @xmath54 with coefficients in a unique factorization domain .",
    "the _ content _ @xmath55 of @xmath56 with respect to @xmath57 is the @xmath58 of the coefficients of @xmath56 , seen as a polynomial in @xmath59 whose coefficients are polynomials in @xmath57 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath60 is called the _ primitive part _ of @xmath56 with respect to @xmath57 . ]",
    "the polynomials obtained from @xmath61 and @xmath62 after removing their @xmath23-contents are denoted by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .    now writing @xmath65 we have ( see theorem 3.6 of @xcite ) that @xmath66 where @xmath0 is _",
    "an implicit equation _ of @xmath28 , and @xmath67 is a product of extraneous linear factors .",
    "the extraneous linear factors can be computed a priori by using lemma 3.4 of @xcite .",
    "it is worth observing that although @xcite assumes that @xmath21 is proper , by following the discussion in @xcite one can check that the results in theorem 3.6 and lemma 3.4 of @xcite are also valid even if @xmath21 is not proper .",
    "notice that we said that @xmath0 is  an \" implicit equation , and not ",
    "the \" implicit equation .",
    "the reason is that @xmath68 is the implicit equation of a curve iff @xmath69 is the polynomial _ of minimum degree _ implicitly defining the curve .",
    "hence , @xmath0 is  the \" implicit equation of @xmath28 iff it is square - free .",
    "we will prove , in section [ sec - main ] , that this is certainly the case whenever two conditions , that we will make precise , hold ; if some of these conditions fails then @xmath0 is not square - free , although we will see that the multiplicity of its components can be computed in advance .",
    "the first of these conditions is related to the properness of @xmath21 , that we recalled at the beginning of the section .",
    "the second condition has to do with the notions of _ simple _ and _ special _ components of an offset curve .",
    "these notions were introduced in @xcite , where a more algebraic definition of the offset curve , using an incidence diagram , is given .",
    "based on this incidence diagram , it is proven that @xmath28 has at most two components .",
    "furthermore , an irreducible component of @xmath28 is said to be _ simple _ if almost every point of that component is generated by just one point of @xmath12 ; otherwise , the component is called _ special_. in @xcite it is proven that for almost all @xmath36 , @xmath28 has simple components , and that @xmath28 can have at most one special component .",
    "furthermore , it is also demonstrated that if @xmath28 is irreducible then it is simple , and that special components only appear when computing offsets to offsets ( in which case the special component is the original curve ) .",
    "additionally , at certain moments in the paper we will distinguish two different types of singular points , _ local singularities _ and _ self - intersections_. in the first case there is just one branch of the curve going through the point , while in the second case there are at least two different branches of the curve through the point ( see section 2.3 of @xcite for more information ) .",
    "notice that the number of local singularities of an algebraic curve is always finite .",
    "furthermore , if an algebraic curve is defined by a square - free polynomial then it also has finitely many self - intersections .",
    "we finish with two results related to the preceding notions , that we will use later . the first one is related to the notions of simple and special components of @xmath28 .",
    "[ nocircle ] there are finitely many points of @xmath28 generated by more than two points of @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , a component @xmath70 of @xmath28 is special iff almost all points of @xmath70 are generated by exactly two points of @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath71 be the square - free part of @xmath0 , and let @xmath41 be a regular point of the curve @xmath72 , which also defines the offset .",
    "the points @xmath40 generating @xmath73 are the intersection points of each line @xmath74 , normal to @xmath28 through @xmath73 , the circle @xmath75 centered at @xmath73 of radius @xmath36 , and @xmath12 . since by hypothesis @xmath73 is regular there is just one normal line @xmath74 .",
    "since the intersection of @xmath74 and @xmath75 consists of at most two points , and since the curve @xmath72 has finitely many singularities , the first part holds .",
    "the second part follows from the notion of special component .",
    "finally , we recall the next lemma , which is proven in appendix i of @xcite ; although in @xcite one works with properly parametrized curves , one can check that the proof of the lemma does not depend on the properness of the curve , and therefore it is also valid in the case of non - proper curves .",
    "[ l - aux ] the only points of the offset where the leading coefficients of @xmath63 , @xmath64 with respect to @xmath23 simultaneously vanish are @xmath76 , in the case when @xmath76 are affine points .",
    "let @xmath77 , @xmath78 be two algebraic curves without common components , and let @xmath79 , @xmath80 be the polynomials implicitly defining @xmath77 and @xmath78 . since @xmath77 , @xmath78 do not have common components , @xmath77 , @xmath78 intersect at finitely many points .",
    "furthermore , each intersection point has an _ intersection multiplicity_. the notion of intersection multiplicity is described , for instance , in ",
    "@xcite , or in  1.6 @xcite . in the general case ,",
    "computing the intersection multiplicity requires certain technicalities ; however , when the intersection point is regular for both @xmath77 and @xmath78 and the tangent line at such a point is different for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the intersection multiplicity is 1 .",
    "now let @xmath81where @xmath18 is constant , and the @xmath82 are the ( possibly complex ) roots of @xmath83 .",
    "then ( see proposition 5 @xcite , and ",
    "1.6 @xcite ) we have the following result .",
    "[ prop - aux ] suppose that @xmath84 is not a common vertical asymptote of @xmath77 and @xmath78 . for all @xmath85 ,",
    "the integer @xmath86 equals the sum of all the intersection multiplicities of the points @xmath87 such that @xmath88 .",
    "in particular , if the line @xmath84 does not contain any point of @xmath89 which is singular for either @xmath77 or @xmath78 , and no point of @xmath90 where the tangent lines to @xmath77 and @xmath78 coincide , then @xmath86 is equal to the number of ( possibly complex ) different points of @xmath89 lying on the line @xmath84 .",
    "in this section we will give a complete description of the factorization of @xmath0 ( see eq .",
    "( [ structure ] ) ) . as a consequence",
    ", we will provide necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath0 to be square - free .",
    "we will need first the following result .",

    "hence , we have that @xmath95 i.e. the functions @xmath96 are identically zero .",
    "now assume that the statement is false .",
    "then the function @xmath97 is also identically zero .",
    "therefore , by arguing as in lemma 8 of @xcite , we deduce that @xmath28 has infinitely many local singularities , which can not be .",
    "now we will separately consider the case when the parametrization @xmath21 is proper , and the case when its tracing index is bigger than @xmath98 .",
    "in this subsection we will assume that the parametrization @xmath21 is proper .",
    "recalling the notation in eq . and",
    "since @xmath28 has at most two components , we can write @xmath99 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 are irreducible , therefore square - free , and @xmath2 is non - constant . if @xmath28 has just one component , then @xmath100",
    ". furthermore , if @xmath28 is reducible and @xmath28 has some special component ( recall that there is at most one component of this type ) , we will assume that @xmath3 implicitly represents this special component .",
    "[ line ] the polynomial @xmath2 explicitly depends on @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",

    "suppose that @xmath2 depends on just one variable , @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "then @xmath28 contains one line . since @xmath103 and the offset of a line is a pair of two parallel lines , @xmath12 contains at least one line . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath12 is rational by hypothesis , it is irreducible . hence , if @xmath12 contains a line then @xmath12 must be a line .",
    "however , this is impossible because by hypothesis @xmath12 is not a line .",
    "now let us consider the set @xmath104 of the @xmath105s satisfying some of the following conditions :    * the intersection of the line @xmath106 with @xmath28 contains some point also belonging to the curve @xmath107 .",

    "<S> it is well known @xcite that an implicit equation of the offset to a rational planar curve can be computed by removing the extraneous components of the resultant of two certain polynomials computed from the parametrization of the curve . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is also well known that the implicit equation provided by the non - extraneous component of this resultant has at most two irreducible factors @xcite . in this paper , we complete the algebraic description of this resultant by showing that the multiplicity of the factors corresponding to the offset can be computed in advance . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when the parametrization is proper , i.e. when the curve is just traced once by the parametrization , we prove that any factor corresponding to a simple component of the offset has multiplicity 1 , while the factor corresponding to the special component , if any , has multiplicity 2 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , if the parametrization is proper and there is no special component , the non - extraneous part of the resultant is square - free . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this condition is proven to be also sufficient . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , this result provides a simple test to check whether or not a given rational curve is the offset of another curve .    keywords : offset curves ; planar rational curves ; squarefree factorization ; implicit equations . </S>"
