    "phylogenetics  @xcite is centered around the reconstruction of evolutionary histories from molecular data extracted from modern species .",
    "the assumption is that molecular data consists of aligned sequences and that each position in the sequences evolves independently according to a markov model on a tree , where the key parameters are ( see section  [ sectionpreliminaries ] for formal definitions ) :    * _ rate matrix . _ an @xmath0 mutation rate matrix @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the alphabet size .",
    "a  typical alphabet is the set of nucleotides @xmath3 , but here we allow more general state spaces . without loss of generality , we denote the alphabet by @xmath4 = \\{1,\\ldots , r\\}$ ] .",

    "the leaves are labeled with names of species . without loss of generality , we assume the labels are @xmath9 $ ] . * _ branch lengths . _ for each edge @xmath10 , we have a scalar branch length @xmath11 which measures the expected total number of substitutions per site along edge  @xmath10 . roughly speaking , @xmath11 is the amount of mutational change between the end points of @xmath10 .",
    "the classical problem in phylogenetics can be stated as follows :    * _ phylogenetic tree reconstruction _",
    "( _ ptr _ ) : _ unmixed case . _ given @xmath12 molecular sequences of length @xmath13 , @xmath14}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 $ ] , which have evolved according to the process above with independent sites , reconstruct the topology of the evolutionary tree .",
    "there exists a vast theoretical literature on this problem ; see , for example ,  @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , various phenomena , notably variations in mutation rates across genomes and incongruences between gene lineage histories , often make it necessary to model molecular data as originating from a _ mixture _ of different phylogenies .    here",
    ", using concentration of measure techniques , we show that mixtures of large trees are typically identifiable . by typically , we mean informally that our results hold under conditions guaranteeing that the tree topologies present in the mixture are sufficiently distinct .",
    "( see section  [ secresults ] for a careful statement of the theorems . ) in particular , we give a broad new class of conditions under which mixtures are identifiable , and we extend , to more general substitution models , previous results on the total variation distance between markov models on trees .",
    "our proofs are constructive in that we provide a computationally efficient reconstruction algorithm .",
    "we also derive sequence - length requirements for high - probability reconstruction .",
    "our identifiability and reconstruction results represent an important first step toward dealing with more biologically relevant mixture models ( such as the ones mentioned above ) in which the tree topologies tend to be similar . in particular , in a recent related paper  @xcite , we have used the techniques developed here to reconstruct common rates - across - sites models .",
    "most prior theoretical work on mixture models has focused on the question of _ identifiability_. a class of phylogenetic models is identifiable if any two models in the class produce different data distributions .",
    "it is well known that unmixed phylogenetic models are typically identifiable  @xcite .",
    "_ this is not the case in general for mixtures of phylogenies .",
    "_ for instance , steel et al .",
    "@xcite showed that for any two trees one can find a random scaling on each of them , such that their data distributions are identical .",
    "hence it is hopeless , in general , to reconstruct phylogenies under mixture models .",
    "see also @xcite for further examples of this type.=-1    however , the negative examples constructed in the references above are not necessarily typical .",
    "they use special features of the mutation models ( and their invariants ) and allow themselves quite a bit of flexibility in setting up the topologies and branch lengths .",
    "in fact , recently a variety of more standard mixture models have been shown to be identifiable .",
    "these include the common @xmath16 model  @xcite and @xmath17 model  @xcite , as well as some covarion models  @xcite , some group - based models  @xcite and so - called @xmath2-component identical tree mixtures  @xcite .",
    "although these results do not provide practical algorithms for reconstructing the corresponding mixtures , they do give hope that these problems may be tackled successfully .",
    "beyond the identifiability question , there seems to have been little rigorous work on reconstructing phylogenetic mixture models .",
    "one positive result is the case of the molecular clock assumption with across - sites rate variation  @xcite , although no sequence - length requirements are provided .",
    "there is a large body of work on practical reconstruction algorithms for various types of mixtures , notably rates - across - sites models and covarion - type models , using mostly likelihood and bayesian methods ; see , for example ,  @xcite for references .",
    "but the optimization problems they attempt to solve are likely np - hard  @xcite .",
    "there also exist many techniques for testing for the presence of a mixture ( e.g. , for testing for rate heterogeneity ) , but such tests typically require the knowledge of the phylogeny ; see , for example ,  @xcite .    here",
    "we give both identifiability and reconstruction results .",
    "the proof of our main results relies on the construction of a _ clustering statistic _ that discriminates between distinct phylogenies .",
    "a similar approach was used recently in  @xcite . there , however , the problem was to distinguish between phylogenies with the _ same _ topology , but _ different _ branch lengths . in the current work ,",
    "a main technical challenge is to analyze the simultaneous behavior of such a clustering statistic on _ distinct _ topologies .",
    "a similar statistic was also used in  @xcite to prove a special case of theorem  [ thm2 ] below . however",
    ", in contrast to  @xcite , our main result requires that a clustering statistic be constructed based only on data generated by the mixture  that is , _ without _ prior knowledge of the topologies to be distinguished . finally ,",
    "unlike  @xcite and  @xcite , we consider the more general gtr model .",
    "a phylogeny is a graphical representation of the speciation history of a group of organisms .",
    "the leaves typically correspond to current species . each branching indicates a speciation event .",
