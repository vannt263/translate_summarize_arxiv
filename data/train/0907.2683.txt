    "among the new hadronic states discovered in the last few years , the @xmath0 is one of the most interesting .",
    "it has been first observed by the belle collaboration in the decay @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this observation was later confirmed by cdf , d0 and babar @xcite .",
    "the current world average mass is @xmath11 which is at the threshold for the production of the charmed meson pair @xmath12 .",
    "this state is extremely narrow , with a width smaller than 2.3 mev at 90% confiedence level .",
    "both belle and babar collaborations reported the radiative decay mode @xmath13 @xcite , which determines @xmath14 .",
    "further studies from belle and cdf that combine angular information and kinematic properties of the @xmath15 pair , strongly favor the quantum numbers @xmath2 or @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "in constituent quark models @xcite the masses of the possible charmonium states with @xmath2 quantum numbers are : @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which are much bigger than the observed mass . in view of this large mass discrepancy the attempts to understand the @xmath19 meson as a conventional quark - antiquark states were abandoned .",
    "the next possibility explored was to treat this state as a multiquark state , composed by @xmath20 , @xmath21 and a light quark antiquark pair .",
    "another experimental finding in favor of this conjecture is the the fact that the decay rates of the processes @xmath22 and @xmath23 are comparable @xcite : = 1.00.40.3 .",
    "[ rate ] this ratio indicates a strong isospin and g parity violation , which is incompatible with a @xmath24 structure for @xmath0 .    in a multiquark approach",
    "we can avoid the isospin violation problem .",
    "the next natural question is : is the @xmath19 made by four quarks in a bag or by a meson - meson molecule ?",
    "the observation of the above mentioned decays , plus the coincidence between the @xmath19 mass and the @xmath25 threshold : @xmath26 @xcite , inspired the proposal that the @xmath0 could be a molecular @xmath27 bound state with small binding energy @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 molecule is not an isospin eigenstate and the rate in eq.([rate ] ) could be explained in a very natural way in this model .",
    "maiani and collaborators @xcite suggested that @xmath0 is a tetraquark .",
    "they have considered diquark - antidiquark states with @xmath29 and symmetric spin distribution : x_q=[cq]_s=1[|c|q]_s=0+[cq]_s=0[|c|q]_s=1 .",
    "the isospin states with @xmath30 are given by : x(i=0)=x_u+x_d , x(i=1)=x_u - x_d .",
    "in @xcite the authors argue that the physical states are closer to mass eigenstates and are no longer isospin eigenstates .",
    "the most general states are then : x_l = x_u+x_d , x_h = x_d- x_u , and both can decay into @xmath31 and @xmath32 . imposing the rate in eq.([rate ] ) , they obtain @xmath33 . they also argue that if @xmath34 dominates @xmath35 decays , then @xmath36 dominates the @xmath37 decays and vice - versa .",
    "therefore , the @xmath19 particle in @xmath35 and @xmath37 decays would be different with @xcite @xmath38 .",
    "there are indeed reports from belle @xcite and babar @xcite collaborations on the observation of the @xmath39 decay . however , these reports ( not completely consistent with each other ) point to a mass difference much smaller than the predicited @xmath40 .    all the conclusions in ref .",
    "@xcite were obtained in the context of a quark model .",
    "given the uncertainties inherent to hadron spectroscopy , it is interesting to confront these theoretical results with qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) calculations .",
    "this was partly done in @xcite where , using the same tetraquark structure proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mass difference @xmath41 was computed and found to be in agreement with the babar measurement ( @xmath42 ) . the same calculation @xcite has obtained @xmath43 . in qcdsr",
    "we can also use a current with the features of the mesonic molecule of the type @xmath27 .",
    "with such a current the calculation reported in @xcite obtained the mass @xmath44 in a better agreement with the experimental mass",
    ". therefore , from a qcdsr point of view , the @xmath0 seems to be better described with a @xmath45 molecular current than with a diquark - antidiquark current .",
    "we feel though that the subject deserves further investigation .    in this work",
    "we use again the qcdsr approach to the @xmath19 structure including a new possibility : the mixing between two and four - quark states .",
    "this will be implemented folowing the prescription suggested in @xcite for the light sector .",
    "the mixing is done at the level of the currents and will be extended to the charm sector . in a different context ( not in qcdsr ) , a similar mixing was suggested already some time ago by suzuki @xcite .",
    "physically , this corresponds to a fluctuation of the @xmath46 state where a gluon is emitted and subsequently splits into a light quark - antiquark pair , which lives for some time and behaves like a molecule - like state .",
    "as it will be seen , in order to be consistent with @xmath19 decay data , we must consider a second mixing between : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "with all these ingredients we perform a calculation of the mass of the @xmath0 and its decay width into @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "there are some experimental data on the @xmath0 meson that seem to indicate the existence of a @xmath24 component in its structure . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that , because of the very loose binding of the molecule , the production rates of a pure @xmath0 molecule should be at least one order of magnitude smaller than what is seen experimentally . also , the recent observation , reported by babar @xcite , of the decay @xmath51 at a rate : = 3.41.4 , [ rategaexp ] is much bigger than the molecular prediction  @xcite : ~410 ^ -3 .",
    "[ ratega ] while this difference could be interpreted as a strong point against the molecular model and as a point in favor of a conventional charmonium interpretation , it can also be interpreted as an indication that there is a significant mixing of the @xmath24 component with the @xmath52 molecule .",
    "similar conclusion was also reached in refs .",
    "therefore , we will follow ref .  @xcite and consider a mixed charmonium - molecular current to study the @xmath0 in the qcd sum rule framework .    for the charmonium part we use the conventional axial current : j^(2)_(x ) = |c_a(x ) _ _ 5 c_a(x )",
    ".    the @xmath53 @xmath54 molecule is interpolated by @xcite : j^(4u)_(x ) & = & 1 , as in ref .",
    "@xcite we define the normalized two - quark current as j^(2u ) _",
    "= 1 6 j^(2 ) _ , and from these two currents we build the following mixed charmonium - molecular current for the @xmath0 : j_^u(x)= ( ) j^(4u)_(x ) + ( ) j^(2u)_(x ) .",
    "the qcd sum rules @xcite are constructed from the two - point correlation function _ ( q ) = id^4x  e^iq.x0 |t[j_^u(x)j_^u(0 ) ]    = -_1(q^2)(g_-q_q_q^2)+_0(q^2)q_q_q^2 . as the axial vector current is not conserved , the two functions , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ 2po ] ) are independent and have respectively the quantum numbers of the spin 1 and 0 mesons .    the sum rules approach is based on the principle of duality .",
    "it consists in the assumption that the correlation function may be described at both quark and hadron levels . at the hadronic level ( the phenomenological side ) the correlation function",
    "is calculated introducing hadron characteristics such as masses and coupling constants . at the quark level ,",
    "the correlation function is written in in terms of quark and gluon fields and a wilson s operator product expansion ( ope ) is used to deal with the complex structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the phenomenological side is treated by first parametrizing the coupling of the axial vector meson @xmath57 , @xmath19 , to the current , @xmath58 , in eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) in terms of the meson - current coupling parameter @xmath59 : [ eq : decay ] 0    meson @xmath19 , we can write the phenomenological side of eq .",

    "the dots denote higher mass axial - vector resonances .",
    "this ressonances will be dealt with through the introduction of a continuum threshold parameter @xmath60 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that a single pole ansatz can be problematic in the case of a multiquark state , and that the two - hadron reducible ( 2hr ) contribution ( or @xmath61-wave @xmath62 contribution , in the present case ) should also be considered in the phenomenological side .",
    "however , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the 2hr contribution is very small .",
    "the reason for this is the following .",
    "the 2hr contribution , in our case , can be written as @xcite : _ ^2hr(q)&=&i(_dd^*)^2  d^4p(2)^4 ( -g_+ p_p_/ m_d^*^2p^2-m_d^*^2 + & & 1(p - q)^2-m_d^2 ) , where 0|j_^(4u)|dd^*(p)=_dd^*_(p ) .",

    "@xcite the current two - meson coupling : @xmath63 , can be written in terms of the @xmath64 meson decay constant , @xmath65 , and the coupling of the @xmath66 meson with a 4-quark current .",
    "this last quantity should be very small , because the properties of the @xmath66 meson , both in spectroscopy and in scattering , are very well understood if it is an ordinary quark - antiquark state .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath63 , should be very small , as in the case of the pentaquark @xcite , and the 2hr contribution can be safely neglected .    in the ope side we work up to dimension 8 at the leading order in @xmath67 .",
