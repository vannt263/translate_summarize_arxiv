    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are the major reservoirs of molecular gas and the sites of most star formation in our galaxy and other galaxies .",
    "their properties set the initial conditions for protostellar collapse , and may play a role in determining the stellar initial mass function @xcite .",
    "moreover , because gmcs provide the bulk of the material for forming new stars their creation may be the limiting mechanism that regulates the rate of star formation in galaxies . therefore",
    ", increasing our understanding of their properties and distribution throughout the different environments of external galaxies is likely to provide further insights into gmc and stellar formation processes .",
    "there is a limited amount of information , however , that can be gained from studies that resolve the general distribution of molecular gas but not the individual molecular clouds . resolving gmcs  to measure their sizes , velocity dispersions , and luminosities  is a critical step in understanding the processes that ultimately drive galaxy evolution .",
    "studies of resolved molecular clouds in the milky way find that gmcs are in approximate virial equilibrium and obey scaling relations , commonly known as larson laws @xcite , that have their origin in the character of the turbulence in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "large scale surveys of the milky way show that gmcs follow uniform scaling relations @xcite , with few differences present between those located in the inner and the outer disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite established that velocity dispersion , size , and luminosity are correlated in milky way gmcs .",
    "observations indicate that gmc line widths increase as a power of their radius @xcite , such that    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the gmc , and @xmath3 is its radius measured in parsecs",
    ". equation [ size_linewidth_eq ] is known as the _ size - line width _ relation , and it has been shown to hold even within gmcs down to very small scales @xcite .",
    "the _ size - line width _ relation is an expression of the equilibrium turbulence conditions in the molecular ism .",
    "detailed modeling of gmc line profiles shows that the emission is macroturbulent ( i.e. , the scale size of the turbulence is larger than the photon mean free path ) , corresponding to many optically thick clumps that have a clump - to - clump velocity dispersion similar to the observed line width @xcite .",
    "it is known that the observed line widths in all but a few very compact , quiescent clouds are too large to be thermal ; at the typical gmc temperatures of @xmath4  k the thermal co velocity dispersion would be @xmath5 .",
    "they are rather due to supersonic turbulence within the clouds .",
    "the dominant sources of turbulence in the molecular ism remain somewhat controversial . for example",
    ", it is not yet known whether turbulence in molecular clouds is primarily internally or externally driven ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "contributors must include star formation  in the form of jets and winds for low mass stars , and winds and expanding hii regions for massive stars  and star destruction  in the form of supernovae shocks and expanding superbubbles .",
    "global processes that couple the large reservoirs of thermal or rotational energy to the turbulent cascade  such as spiral shocks and several types of instabilities that involve shear , magnetic fields , and self gravity  are important on the largest spatial scales .",
    "the fact that turbulence is present on scales @xmath6 pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that the dissipation lifetime of the largest eddies is @xmath7 yr @xcite , point to constant ( or at least frequent ) energy injection on large scales .",
    "this in turn suggests that massive stellar death and gobal mechanisms are predominantly responsible for the bulk of turbulent energy injection in the milky way , although their respective dominance is a matter of debate @xcite .    the last two larson relations , the _ luminosity - line width _ and _ luminosity - size _ relations , describe correlations between cloud luminosity , @xmath8 , and either velocity dispersion or size ( note , as is frequently pointed out , that only two of the three larson relations are independent ) .",
    "they are @xcite    @xmath9    and    @xmath10    with @xmath2 and @xmath3 expressed in their corresponding units of  and pc .",
    "thus , the observations show that the virial mass , @xmath11 , relates to the co luminosity ( which is proportional to the inferred luminous mass @xmath12 ) in the following manner @xcite ,    @xmath13    where @xmath8 is expressed in",
    ". we will call this equation the galactic _ mass - luminosity _ relation .",
    "note that the exponent of @xmath8 is somewhat uncertain , and we take here the value reported by @xcite .",
    "although the relation may not be precisely linear it is almost so , and simple models of molecular clouds can explain the observed linearity @xcite .",
    "this approximate proportionality between @xmath14 and @xmath11 within the galaxy allows the definition of an empirical co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor , , that relates the intensity of a gmc in the @xmath15co @xmath16  transition to its h@xmath0 column density ( @xmath17 ) and ultimately its mass .",
    "for gmcs around a median mass of @xmath18 m@xmath19 @xcite obtained a co - to - h@xmath0 factor that , when adjusted to the currently accepted distance of 8.5  kpc to the galactic center , yields @xmath20  @xcite . in the milky way ,",
    "this `` virial mass '' approach yields conversion factors similar to those obtained from non - dynamical measurements , strongly suggesting that clouds are in a dynamical state intermediate between marginal gravitational binding and virial equilibrium ( e.g. , @xmath21-ray results and modeling of the galactic plane dust continuum ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with magnetic energy introducing a small but non - negligible correction on the small scales ( @xmath22 ; * ? ? ?",
    "throughout this paper we adopt @xmath23  as the galactic conversion factor .",
    "note , however , that some nearby lines - of - sight at high galactic latitudes may exhibit significant larger values of this coefficient ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , mass estimates of gmcs show that they are gravitationally bound and in approximate virial equilibrium , which requires @xmath24 . as a consequence of equation [ size_linewidth_eq ] and virial equilibrium ,",
    "all gmcs have approximately the same mean column density : @xmath25 @xmath26 , or an equivalent mass surface density @xmath27 m@xmath19  pc@xmath28 ( after applying a 40% correction for the mass contribution of elements heavier than hydrogen ) .",
    "an equivalent result is that all milky way gmcs have approximately the same mean visual extinction from edge to edge , @xmath29 , using the standard dust - to - gas ratio @xcite .",
    "@xcite argues that equation [ lco_mvir_eq ] is a consequence of the interplay between co chemistry , the milky way radiation field , the dust - to - gas ratio , and the local pressure of the ism . as a result ,",
    "h@xmath0 clouds observable in co are at least marginally bound .",
    "furthermore , @xcite argues that the constancy of @xmath30 stems from the fact that clouds with lower column density would not be bright in co , while clouds with higher column density would rapidly collapse .",
    "another consequence of the larson relations is that galactic gmcs have low volume - averaged densities , @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "therefore their clumpiness must be high in order to excite the rotational transitions of co and of other commonly observed high - density tracer molecules such as hco@xmath33 , which require volume densities in excess of 10@xmath34 @xmath32 .",
    "this clumpiness is probably induced by supersonic turbulence @xcite .",
    "further , the average density of a gmc decreases with increasing mass , and as a result the free fall time in the cloud increases .",
    "this led @xcite to predict that larger gmcs will form collapsing cores and stars less rapidly than smaller ones .",
    "the purpose of this study is to determine , _ using a consistent methodology _ , the relations between size , velocity dispersion , and luminosity for extragalactic gmcs that are encapsulated in the milky way by the larson laws .",
    "we do so by studying gmcs in dwarf galaxies and comparing them with those in spiral galaxies .",
    "dwarf galaxies are both numerous and nearby , and host physical conditions that fall outside those explored by surveys of the milky way .",
    "the range of parameter space thus probed provides an ideal laboratory to test theories of cloud structure and formation .",
    "particularly , dwarf galaxies have low metallicities and their lack of internal extinction results in intense radiation fields , reminiscent of the conditions in primitive galaxies .",
    "they display irregular morphologies and are not dominated by spiral structure .",
    "dwarfs often have slowly rising , nearly solid - body , rotation curves ; this translates into small rotational shear and perhaps changes the sources and scales of turbulence in their ism .",
    "the stellar potential wells of dwarf galaxies are weaker than those in large spiral galaxies and the ambient ism may be correspondingly less dense .",
    "these environmental changes may influence the equilibrium conditions of gmcs , and affect their larson relations .",
    "the integrated properties of dwarf galaxies already show clear evidence that environment affects at least the co content . dwarf irregular galaxies are fainter in co than large spiral galaxies .",
    "galaxies with metallicity @xmath35 are seldom detected in co emission @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxies of higher metallicity detected in co , however , show similar co luminosity relative to either their stellar or atomic gas content as larger galaxies @xcite . here",
    "we investigate whether the resolved properties of gmcs in these galaxies also reflect their changing environments .",
    "the study of resolved gmc properties in other galaxies remains technically challenging .",
    "a typical size for a galactic gmc is @xmath36  pc , which at the @xmath37 mpc distance of the m  81 group translates to an angular size of @xmath38 .",
    "achieving such a resolution requires an antenna 250 meters in diameter operating at @xmath39  mm , the wavelength of the ground transition of @xmath15co .",
    "this is clearly an impractical proposition , but aperture synthesis techniques used by millimeter - wave interferometers routinely attain this resolution .",
    "they do so , however , at the price of reduced surface brightness sensitivity with respect to their filled aperture equivalents , and studies such as the one presented here are ultimately limited by sensitivity .",
    "until the advent of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) these observations will remain challenging .",
    "because of these difficulties , the resolved properties of gmcs in galaxies other than the milky way remain a largely unexplored domain . because of its proximity , located at a distance where even a modest telescope can attain a resolution of @xmath40  pc , the first galaxy where observations capable of clearly resolving individual gmcs were possible was the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "the first resolved study of a gmc beyond the immediate vicinity of the milky way was performed in m  31 @xcite , while the first large scale interferometric survey of gmcs in another galaxy was done on m  33 @xcite .",
    "the first comprehensive analyses in the magellanic clouds were performed on the small magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently presented a study of gmcs in the local group , analyzing observations from co surveys complete down to a known mass limit over a significant fraction of each galaxy .",
    "this study concluded that the larson relations in the milky way disk were approximately those observed throughout the local group , although some offsets ( possibly methodological ) were present .",
    "they also concluded that gmcs within a particular galaxy have roughly constant surface density , @xmath41 , and that once corrections for the local co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor are applied the sample as a whole has a scatter of only a factor of 2 in @xmath41 .",
    "finally , they calculated a typical conversion factor @xmath42 , accurate to within 50% for most of the sample except the small magellanic cloud , for which they obtain a value @xmath43 times larger .",
    "this paper proceeds as follows : in  [ data ] we describe the data sets and and galaxies studied . in  [ method ]",
    "we summarize the method used to consistently derive gmc properties across the different datasets . in  [ results ]",
    "we discuss the _ size - line width _",
    ", _ luminosity - line width _ , and _ luminosity - size _ relations in our sample of extragalactic gmcs , and compare them with the galaxy . in ",
    "[ discussion ] we discuss the implications of these results on the equilibrium of clouds in the small magellanic cloud , the photoionization - regulated star formation theory , the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor , and the brightness temperature of extragalactic clouds . in each case",
    "we contrast our results in dwarf galaxies with those obtained in the milky way and the other local group spirals , m  31 and m  33 . in  [ summary ]",
    "we summarize this study and present our conclusions .",
    "we use data from four telescopes : the berkeley - illinois - maryland array ( bima ; * ? ? ?",

    "their study , however , does not make an explicit correction for the effects of sensitivity ( they use boundary isosurfaces of brightness temperature t@xmath70 to 7  k ) .",
    "it also uses an outdated galactocentric distance for the sun ( 10 kpc ) .",
    "it is unclear how to best correct correct their catalogued cloud properties to bring them into closer agreement with our methodology .",

    "these data are in good agreement with the standard larson relations derived for the milky way sample .",
    "the challenge of any study that uses different instruments to study galaxies with a range of intrinsic properties and distances is to control the systematic biases introduced by the differences in the datasets .",
    "we measure cloud properties using the algorithm described in detail by @xcite and summarized here .",
    "this method measures luminosities , line widths , and sizes of gmcs in a manner that minimizes the biases introduced by signal - to - noise and resolution .",
    "these biases are the achilles heel of comparisons of gmc measurements across different galaxies obtained by different telescopes .",
    "@xcite proposed that moment measurements combined with beam deconvolution and extrapolation represent a robust way to compare heterogeneous observations of molecular clouds .",
    "the algorithm is part of a package called cprops implemented in idl and is available upon request .",
    "the remainder of this section summarizes the approach step - by - step .",
    "the robustness , reliability , and consistency of the cprops methodology was tested by @xcite for a globally applicable set of algorithm parameters .",
    "they found the algorithm performed very well for data with signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) @xmath71 , but cautioned that measurements of the properties of gmcs observed with low s / n remain uncertain , particularly when using the default set of algorithm parameters .",
    "unfortunately , co is faint in dwarf galaxies , which makes it difficult to attain the optimal combination of s / n and spatial resolution",
    ". therefore , only a few of the datasets discussed here meet the s / n@xmath72 criterion .",
    "nevertheless , the data assembled here represent the best observations of gmcs in dwarf galaxies to date . as a consequence of the low s / n data , we made minor adjustments described below to the standard cprops parameters to improve the reliability of our results .",
    "first , we identify regions of significant emission in each data set . for most of our data",
    "these are defined as regions that contain pixels which satisfy the condition of having 3 consecutive velocity channels above @xmath73 significance ( i.e. a high significance `` core '' ) .",
    "we extend these regions to include all adjacent data which has at least 2 consecutive channels above @xmath74 significance .",
    "for a few data sets this did not yield the best results and we adjusted either the core or the edge conditions : a higher edge threshold was used in the high s / n n83 and n159 data sets ; lower core thresholds were needed for the low s / n ngc  185 and ngc  205 data sets ; a few other minor adjustments were also made .",
    "these changes yielded stable properties for clouds of low s / n , and suppressed diffuse emission blending clouds together in the extremely high s / n case .",
    "the signal identification step , often referred to as `` masking '' , can have a large impact on derived cloud properties and is difficult to motivate physically , especially in the low s / n regime common to much of our data .",
    "thus , by necessity this step introduces a certain amount of subjectivity in the analysis .",
    "once signal is identified , data is apportioned into individual clouds following @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "we use the `` physical priors '' described in their appendix , which set the parameters of the decomposition to common values motivated by the properties of galactic gmcs .",
    "this entails decomposing emission into clouds using effective spatial and velocity resolutions of 15  pc and 2  km  s@xmath75 and ignoring even high - contrast substructure below these scales .",
    "when it is not possible to achieve these resolutions because of limitations in the data , we use the actual spatial or velocity resolution of the observations .",
    "when two potential clouds share an isosurface , the algorithm adopts a conservative approach to separating them .",
    "the clouds are considered separate only if all of the following conditions are met : 1 ) each is large enough to measure meaningful properties , 2 ) each shows a minimum contrast between peak and edge , and 3 ) the decision to break the isosurface into multiple clouds has a significant effect on the derived cloud properties .",
    "@xcite showed this approach to be conservative and robust in the presence of noise , minimizing the identification of low - signal , marginally resolved ( and thus often spurious ) clouds .      after identifying the individual clouds ,",
    "we calculate their size , velocity dispersion , and co luminosity .",
    "we determine the major and minor axis of the cloud using principal component analysis and measure the second moments of emission distribution along these axes .",
    "the rms size of the cloud ( @xmath76 ) is the geometric mean of these two moments .",
    "the velocity dispersion ( @xmath2 ) is measured from the second moment along the velocity axis , and the luminosity via the zeroth moment ( sum ) over the cloud .    at finite",
    "signal - to - noise the second moment will underestimate the true cloud size , introducing a sensitivity bias .",
    "although for galactic data it is possible to measure reliable properties by adopting a fixed brightness boundary for clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it would be impossible to compare measurements of different galaxies without removing this bias .",
    "we avoid the sensitivity bias by measuring the size , velocity , and luminosity as a function of intensity isosurface and extrapolating this to the case of infinite signal - to - noise .",
    "the size and line width of the cloud are extrapolated linearly , the luminosity is extrapolated quadratically ( see * ? ? ? * for a justification of the extrapolation orders ) .",
    "we discussed in  [ disks ] the corrections that we apply to the galactic sample to bring it into agreement with our methodology .",
    "it is often the case for extragalactic observations that the size and line width of a gmc are comparable to the angular and velocity resolution of the telescope .",
    "we correct for this by `` deconvolving '' both the telescope beam and the velocity channel profile .",
    "we do so by subtracting their values from the extrapolated moment measurements in quadrature .",

    "size measurements of clouds that are only marginally resolved suffer from substantial uncertainty , and this is accounted for in the error estimates .      from the moment measurements we convert to physical units",
    " radius , luminous mass , virial mass .",
    "the velocity dispersion is given directly by the moment .",
    "we convert the rms size to the spherical radius of the cloud using the factor @xmath77 , so that radii in this paper follow the @xcite definition : @xmath78 .",
    "this factor can be motivated by considering a constant density spherical cloud and comparing its rms size to its radius .",
    "we compute luminous masses , @xmath12 , using the formula    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the integrated @xmath15co flux of the molecular cloud measured in jy  , @xmath81 is the distance to the source in mpc , and the coefficient corresponds to our adopted conversion factor @xmath82 , and includes the contribution of the cosmological he abundance to the total mass .",
    "equivalently , for a co luminosity @xmath8 expressed in  pc@xmath83 ,    @xmath84    we compute the virial masses under the assumption that each cloud is spherical and virialized with a density profile of the form @xmath85 .",
    "this assumption is made for consistency with previous work , and we can not assess its validity with the data in hand .",
    "thus the virial mass is given by the formula @xcite    @xmath86    where @xmath2 is the cloud velocity dispersion in , @xmath3 is the spherical cloud radius in pc , and @xmath11 is the cloud virial mass in m@xmath19 .",
    "implicit in this equation is the assumption that the virial parameter equals one .",
    "other works , in particular those focused on milky way clouds , have treated clouds as ellipsoids and used the corresponding form of the virial theorem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , instead of the simplified equation [ virialmass ] .",
    "because of the low resolution and s / n of extragalactic observations , this approach is untenable",
    ". under these conditions , deconvolution becomes very difficult and the precise shape of the source is hard , if not impossible , to recover .",
    "we note that the more complex measurements of cloud dimensions reduce to the @xcite rms size parameter for use in the @xcite formulation of the the virial theorem .",
    "to relate the mass surface density , @xmath41 , to the coefficient of the _ size - line width _ relation , @xmath87 , we simply divide equation [ virialmass ] by the area of the cloud , @xmath88 , to obtain    @xmath89    where the coefficient @xmath90 is in units of  pc@xmath91 and the surface density is expressed in m@xmath19  pc@xmath28 .",

    "thus these small clouds have an excess of kinetic energy over their self - gravity , are not in virial equilibrium , and in order to be bound they have to be confined by an external pressure of order @xmath107  k. the precise location of the break in the _ size - line width _ relation is then likely a function of the local pressure of the cloud environment .",
    "similarly , analysis of the @xmath108co emission from gmcs in the inner 3 kpc of the milky way reveals a less steep _ size - line width _",
    "relation than that obtained from @xmath15co studies , @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "these authors conclude that although cloud complexes are bound , many of the clumps identified in their study are not gravitationally bound , probably due in part to the methodology of their clump identification algorithm . finally , @xcite measured the gmc properties near the galactic center , finding that those clouds have line widths a factor of 3 to 5 times larger than similar clouds in the disk and suggesting that this is due to the large pressure in this region .",
    "these studies show that there are observed departures from the traditional _ size - line width _ relation in the milky way , in the direction of larger line widths for a given size .",
    "figure [ size_linewidth ] shows our results for the ensemble of extragalactic clouds",
    ". remarkably , dwarf galaxy cloud measurements are broadly compatible with the milky way _ size - line width _ relation , represented by the gray area and the small dots from the sample of @xcite .",
    "detailed inspection of the data reveals , however , that there is a tendency for gmcs in dwarf galaxies to fall preferentially under the galactic relationship .",
    "this is most apparent in a few clouds in the lmc , ic  10 , and most clouds in the smc , which are significantly inconsistent with the milky way .",
    "note that these departures occur in the direction opposite from those described in the previous paragraph . while we may suspect",
    "that cloud measurements yielding sizes @xmath110  pc are affected by blending ( such as those on the right side of the diagram ) , we have no reason to think that there are problems with the lmc , smc , or ic  10 , where we have some of the best spatial resolutions in the dataset . furthermore , the control sample of m  31 and m  33 gmcs is entirely consistent with the galactic _ size - line width _ relation and does not suffer from the same offsets . we discuss the particular situation of the smc , which exhibits the most convincing departures , in  [ smc ] .",
    "note that @xcite arrived at a different conclusion in their study of the smc . because the gmc samples do not substantially overlap it is difficult to assess the source of the discrepancy .",
    "we attribute it mostly to the differences in the analysis methodologies , albeit it is possible that the samples are intrinsically different ( perhaps due to different radiation environments ) .",
    "although it is not entirely correct to derive a unique _ size - line width _ relation for the ensemble of extragalactic data , we have determined a best fit relation . in order to avoid driving the result with the small formal error bars in the magellanic clouds , and to better represent the scatter in the data , we increase the errors in quadrature in both variables until we obtain a best fit @xmath111 value of unity .",
    "the resulting relation , illustrated by the dashed blue line in figure [ size_linewidth ] , is    @xmath112    where the data are fit in the log  log plane with simultaneous errors in both variables , and the error bars are derived using a bootstrapping technique .",
    "if we only use the dwarf galaxy data , the coefficient and the exponent are @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively .",
    "if the _ size - line width _ relation is interpreted in terms of virialized self - gravitating clouds supported mainly by turbulence , the compatibility between the galactic relation and our measurements implies that most gmcs in dwarf galaxies have surface densities not very different from galactic gmcs , for which @xmath115 .",
    "extragalactic gmcs that fall under the galactic _ size - line width _ relation would have lower surface and volume densities than corresponding clouds in the milky way . the small - size , low velocity dispersion end of the dash - dotted line in figure [ size_linewidth ] corresponds to a drop of approximately a factor of 2 in the velocity dispersion , which translates to a factor of 4 decrease in surface density with respect to the galactic value .",
    "this surface density may be appropriate for the most extreme galaxies in the sample ( c.f . , table [ restab ] ) .",
    "if we fit a model that is proportional to @xmath116 , the sample of dwarf galaxies is consistent with an average surface density @xmath117 .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the virial parameter , a measure of the ratio of kinetic to gravitational energy of the cloud @xcite , is different for these objects .",
    "the virial parameter , @xmath118 , can be expressed in terms of the velocity dispersion following equation 27 in @xcite to obtain @xmath119 .",
    "thus , a low coefficient in the _ size - line width _ relation can be attributed to a lower than galactic virial parameter . bound clouds in the milky way",
    "have @xmath120 , while pressure - confined clouds exhibit @xmath121  a cloud in equilibrium with @xmath122 requires some additional type of support , presumably provided by magnetic fields . on the spatial scales studied here ,",
    "such support is usually unimportant in the milky way .",
    "figures [ lumlw ] and [ lumsize ] show the relations between @xmath15co luminosities and either velocity dispersion or cloud radius .",
    "these luminosities can be related to the corresponding luminous mass @xmath12 for a galactic  using eqs .",
    "[ mlum ] and [ mlum2 ] .",
    "the steep dependency on @xmath2 in equation [ lum_lw_eq ] is a direct consequence of the observed _ size - line width _ relation in combination with the assumption of virial equilibrium .",
    "the coefficient in front of this equation reflects a combination of the area filling fraction by co clumps within the resolved cloud , and the kinetic temperature of the gas itself .    inspection of figures [ lumlw ] and [ lumsize ] reveals that , despite the variety of environments sampled and the consistently lower - than - galactic metallicity of our sources , there is good agreement between the properties of extragalactic and galactic gmcs .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that there is an overall tendency for clouds in dwarf galaxies to be underluminous for their size , and clouds in the smc tend to be also overluminous for their velocity dispersion . in other words , they tend to be larger and ( in the case of the smc ) more quiescent ( as traced by their velocity dispersion ) than milky way gmcs of similar luminosity .",
    "the fit to all the extragalactic data , conducted as in  [ sizelw ] , shows that the _ luminosity - line width _ relation is    @xmath123    where the shallower  than  galactic slope is driven mostly by the small smc clouds . a similar analysis but including only the dwarf galaxy data yields a coefficient @xmath124 and an exponent @xmath125 , thus very consistent with the results when m  31 and m  33 are included . the corresponding extragalactic _ luminosity - size _",
    "relation is    @xmath126    where the corresponding coefficient and exponent when fitting only the dwarf galaxy data are @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "this shows that the data are completely consistent with the galactic slope , but the relation is noticeably displaced toward lower luminosities for a given size .",
    "figure [ lumsize ] suggests that , despite our efforts to correct for them , there may be a remaining methodological offset in the cloud size determination between the sample of @xcite and this study , of order 30% toward larger @xmath3 ( equivalent to a factor of @xmath99 toward lower luminosities ) .",
    "unfortunately , establishing the origin of these offset would require a full reanalysis of the original galactic survey . with the quality of the data at hand it is difficult to assert whether methodological or real offsets are driving the observed shift toward larger cloud sizes ,",
    "although it seems that the likely methodological offsets are too small to explain the level of discrepancy in many sources  most notably the smc .",
    "figure [ lco_mvir ] illustrates the behavior of luminosity and virial mass described by equation [ lco_mvir_eq ] for our sample of extragalactic gmcs . @xcite",
    "discuss this empirical relation in some detail , showing that it is a natural outcome of the combination of the _ size - line width _ relation with the assumption of virial equilibrium when all clouds share similar kinetic temperatures and area filling fractions in their resolved co emission . despite the aforementioned tendency for clouds in dwarf galaxies to be underluminous for their sizes , their virial masses are , on average ,",
    "only slightly underpredicted by their co luminosity . in the particular case of gmcs in the smc , because the observed departures from the standard _ luminosity - line width _ and _ luminosity - size _ relations occur in opposite directions , their larger sizes and smaller velocity dispersions for a given luminosity approximately cancel out in the virial mass calculation .",
    "thus most reliable extragalactic clouds in our sample are remarkably compatible with equation [ lco_mvir_eq ] .",
    "the fit to the entire extragalactic sample yields    @xmath129    while the fit to the dwarf galaxies only has a coefficient of @xmath130 , and an exponent @xmath131 .",
    "thus the extragalactic and galactic _ mass - luminosity _ relations are in excellent agreement for gmcs in the mass range @xmath132 m@xmath19 .",
    "this suggests that , by comparison with equation [ mlum2 ] ,  is on average a factor of @xmath133 to @xmath134 larger than our adopted galactic value of @xmath135  ( although with large error bars ) .",
    "we will discuss the consequences for  and the presence of any metallicity trends in the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor in ",

    "we outlined in  [ introresol ] some of the conclusions of the recent study of the local group by @xcite .",
    "we employed here the same datasets for m  31 and m  33 , analyzing them with a later version of the same cprops algorithm . while @xcite emphasized completion to study the cloud statistics , the present analysis made use of the available data with the best possible combination of sensitivity and resolution , thus employing different datasets for the magellanic clouds and ic  10 .",
    "furthermore , this study incorporates a large number of galaxies in and beyond the local group that were not analyzed in @xcite .",
    "many of the results , however , are reassuringly similar : extragalactic gmcs broadly share the same properties observed in milky way gmcs , although the clouds in some galaxies ( notably the smc ) appear to be somewhat different from the remainder of the sample .",

    "this contraction happens at the ambipolar diffusion rate , as the neutrals diffuse through the ions which are anchored by the magnetic field .",

    "* ) , so that the observed lack of a trend in @xmath259 is not directly caused by a cancellation between the effects of isrf and metallicity .",
    "early support for photoionization regulated star formation was found by @xcite , who used iras 60 and 100 @xmath260 m data , a model of pdr regions , and h@xmath0 and [ cii ] measurements to derive the structure of molecular clouds in the magellanic clouds .",
    "their determination of column densities , however , hinges critically on the estimate of the radiation field , which is derived from iras measurements . in the smc they model dust temperatures in the range of @xmath261  k , higher than the temperatures in the @xcite map which employs the same data .",
    "we use the iris data to check the temperature towards lirs36 , one of their target regions , and find it to be 33  k instead of the 45  k derived by @xcite .",
    "because the estimated radiation field is very strongly dependent on the assumed dust temperature , this alone suggests a @xmath68 times lower field than they adopt .",
    "this is enough to bring their result into approximate agreement with our own , and makes the radiation field in this region intermediate between galactic and 30 doradus in the lmc .",
    "a further concern with this analysis stems from the use of 60 @xmath260 m data to establish a temperature , as it is known that there is an important contribution from stochastically heated small grains at this wavelength ( particularly in the magellanic clouds , * ? ? ?",

    "for example , mass estimates of molecular clouds subjected to extreme radiation fields , such as those in starburst environments , suggest that they have an  conversion factor 4 to 20 times smaller than in the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . this can be understood in terms of a larger emissivity per co molecule in starburst galaxies , stemming from a higher excitation state due to larger physical temperatures and volume densities in these environments ( e.g. ,",
    "another possibility is that a key assumption underlying the co - to-  proportionality , that the co line width traces the  mass , breaks down in very co - rich systems @xcite .",
    "similarly ,  conversion factors a few times lower than that of the galactic disk are commonly observed in the centers of spiral galaxies , including our own @xcite .",
    "a property of the ism that is expected to have a dramatic impact on the value of  is its heavy - element abundance @xcite . unlike density or radiation field fluctuations , metallicity does not average out over the large areas sampled by a telescope beam .",
    "in fact , dwarf galaxies , which tend to have subsolar metallicities , show little evidence for metallicity gradients at least in the examples where such gradients could be well measured ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "metallicity affects cloud structure in two ways : 1 ) directly , as smaller abundances of c and o translate into lower co yields , and 2 ) indirectly , as the dust - to - gas ratio is lowered , which in turn diminishes the formation rates and the shielding of molecular gas from the photodissociating effects of ultraviolet radiation .",
    "the observational effects expected from these changes can be summarized as follows : as metallicity decreases , decreasing dust shielding pushes the c@xmath33 to co transition further into the molecular gas . in terms of a spherical clump ,",
    "the radius of the @xmath271 surface for co becomes smaller as the metallicity decreases .",
    "because at high - enough extinction most of the carbon in the gas phase turns into , which in turn becomes rapidly optically thick , the actual c / h ratio of the gas has only a small effect on the position of @xmath271 surface . for a typical galactic cloud , for example",
    ", the c@xmath33/co transition occurs at @xmath272 while the @xmath271 surface of co occurs at column densities @xmath273  @xmath26  ( ) @xmath75 which translate into visual extinction of @xmath274 for a typical gas  phase carbon abundance .",
    "thus , almost immediately after becoming the dominant form of carbon ,  turns optically thick .",

    "co , however , is only mildly self  shielding , although it also cross  shields with  at column densities @xmath275 @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "if the conditions are such that  self - shielding dominates over dust shielding at lower metallicities , the atomic to molecular /transition will not move into the cloud for decreasing dust - to - gas ratios . as a result ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are several observational calibrations of  with metallicity , @xmath276 , in the literature , showing a range of behaviors .",
    "most of the calibrations find an increasing  with decreasing @xmath276 although the rate of increase varies greatly depending on the technique and the spatial resolution of the observations used .",
    "a key datum in these calibrations is the measurement in the small magellanic cloud , as this is the galaxy with the lowest metallicity where co is reliably detected ( @xmath277 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the first systematic study of this galaxy , @xcite used single - dish co observations and the assumption of clouds in virial equilibrium to determine that @xmath278  at a resolution of @xmath279  pc , while finding @xmath280  on scales of @xmath281  pc .",
    "@xcite revisited the estimate of  in the smc with new single ",
    "dish observations at a resolution of @xmath282  pc and found @xmath283  , in rough agreement with the previous results .",
    "one important issue with these determinations is that it is unclear whether the large scale structures observed in co are self - gravitating , virialized molecular clouds .",
    "the applicability of the virial theorem on scales of 100  pc and larger and the ability to accurately measure the size of the co structures , both necessary to apply equation [ virialmass ] , are problematic .",
    "another issue with these determinations is that they do not account for the finite angular resolution of the telescope , which is in many cases comparable to the sizes of the clouds .",
    "this will systematically bias these measurements in the direction of larger virial masses and larger .",
    "subsequently @xcite used millimeter - wave continuum observations to obtain the mass of the quiescent cloud smcb1 - 1 and compare it with its co emission , reaching the conclusion that the dust - derived mass is 7 to 20 times larger than the cloud virial mass .",
    "they suggest that this  is located in an envelope of the cloud that does not emit brightly in co. very recently , @xcite used new far - infrared ( fir ) images of the smc obtained by the _",
    "space telescope to model the dust emission and locally calibrate its dust - to - gas ratio , obtaining a map of  in this galaxy .",
    "comparison with the co emission indicates that the clouds are on average @xmath284 more extended than the co - emitting regions , so that co clouds are immersed in an extended molecular envelope of .",
    "furthermore , over the volume occupied by co , @xcite find @xmath278 , while the overall  for the entire smc is approximately twice that .    among the calibrations for  with metallicity , a number of them rely on the assumption of virial equilibrium to obtain the molecular mass of gmcs .",
    "@xcite used interferometric co observations of m  33 and dwarf galaxies in conjunction with the aforementioned @xcite results to establish that @xmath285 , where @xmath276 is measured using the oxygen abundance , as o / h .",
    "@xcite used several observations in the literature to determine that @xmath286 . employing some of the same interferometric observations analyzed here , @xcite determined a galactic value for  in ngc  4214 , a galaxy where @xmath287 . a result of 60% of the galactic value",
    "was obtained in ngc  3077 @xcite , a galaxy with approximately galactic metallicity .",
    "similarly , @xcite used interferometric observations of the entire disk of m  33 and found no dependence of  on metallicity over a range of 0.8 dex in @xmath276 ( a factor of 6 ) .",
    "all these studies are based on virial mass techniques .",
    "calibrations tend to be even more discrepant when other methods are employed .",
    "besides the aforementioned results by @xcite , @xcite used  and infrared astronomy satellite ( iras ) observations of several galaxies , estimating @xmath288  in the smc and finding a metallicity dependence @xmath289 , or @xmath290 when taking into account the local interstellar radiation field .",
    "@xcite used measurements of the fir  ( @xmath291p@xmath292p@xmath293 )  transition to estimate @xmath294 in some regions of the low metallicity dwarf galaxy ic  10 , and over 100 times the galactic value overall ( @xmath295 ) .",
    "@xcite used stellar extinction in the lmc to measure @xmath296  , toward the low end of virial mass estimates for this source .",
    "finally , @xcite found a milder @xmath286 dependence using a combination of virial and dust  continuum methods . in summary , there are large discrepancies between the different authors and techniques , and in general estimates based on fir observations find stronger dependencies on metallicity than those based on virial arguments , although typically they also probe larger scales .",
    "a problem with the available studies has been the lack of uniformity in the datasets , methods , and analysis techniques .",
    "unexpectedly , the most uniform calibration in the literature ( that of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where all the clouds are at the same distance , the spatial resolution is good ( 20 pc ) , and identical analysis is applied to the data finds that  is independent of @xmath276 .",
    "very recent observations , however , cast doubts on the magnitude of the metallicity gradient in this galaxy .",
    "@xcite find that the metallicity gradient of m  33 is a factor of 3 shallower than previously accepted , which implies that the rosolowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) gmc data probes a considerably smaller range of @xmath276 than previously thought .",
    "thus mild metallicity dependencies of  within this galaxy may be masked by the internal scatter of the measurements .",
    "another potential issue is that similar gradients in the radiation field and metallicity with galactocentric distance have opposite effects and may conspire to produce an almost constant @xcite .",
    "the fact that the overwhelming majority of our extragalactic gmcs with reliable property determinations are compatible with the empirical galactic relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath11 described by equation [ lco_mvir_eq ] (  [ luminosity_relations ] ) implies that we do not observe extreme departures from a galactic .",
    "indeed , figure [ metxco ] shows our results for the extragalactic calibration of  with metallicity , using virial gmc masses .",
    "the gray region illustrates the approximate range of  in the milky way found by @xcite , a factor of 2 around the nominal @xmath135 .",
    "the thick lines show the dispersion of values for the gmcs in the @xcite sample with masses larger than @xmath297 m@xmath19 .",
    "the symbols show the average of @xmath298 for all gmcs in each galaxy in our sample , with the corresponding vertical bars indicating the error and range of @xmath298 within a galaxy . the galaxy that shows the largest departure from galactic  is ngc  205 , but with only one identified cloud we lack significant statistics .",
    "the situation is similar for ngc  1569 .",
    "note that although the gmcs in the smc show an average three times galactic , they are not unusual compared with galactic clouds of the same mass ( recall that equation [ lco_mvir_eq ] is not a linear relation , and galactic clouds with masses similar to our smc clouds have similar ratios of virial to luminous mass ; c.f . ,",
    "figure [ lco_mvir ] ) .",
    "thus , gmcs in dwarf galaxies are remarkably compatible with a galactic  _ independent of their metallicity _ , and any metallicity trends appear to be much weaker than the dispersion of the measurements .    to further quantify this statement",
    "we have carried out a number of fits to the data .",
    "we do not consider in the fits ngc  2976 ( because of its uncertain metallicity ) , and the milky way ( which may suffer from a systematic methodological offset ) .",
    "a least - squares bivariate fit @xmath299 with simultaneous errors in both axes to the measurements for all remaining galaxies yields a slope @xmath300 and @xmath301 , with errors estimated using bootstrapping . increasing all errors proportionally to obtain @xmath302 yields @xmath303 .",
    "similar fits to the data for the galaxies with the largest number of gmc measurements ( m  31 , m  33 , ic  10 , lmc , and smc ) yield @xmath304 ( @xmath305 ) and @xmath306 ( @xmath302 ) .",
    "these results , plus the considerations in the paragraph above , confirm that there is no measurable trend in the resolved  with metallicity present in the data . as we discuss below , however , this does not imply that there is no metallicity trend in the global ratio of co - to - h@xmath0 in galaxies .    what about the possibility of clouds being more massive than the simple virial mass estimate",
    "? we already discussed the observation that several clouds in ic  10 and the smc are not quite compatible with the galactic _ size - line width _ relation , in the direction of too small a line width for a given size .",
    "we will argue in  [ smc ] that a possibility is that these clouds are transient structures not in equilibrium that will collapse in a few myr due to the lack of turbulent support , or that they may be supported by magnetic fields in larger proportion than the typical galactic gmc . in either case",
    ", such clouds could be removed from the sample since their line width may underestimate their true mass .",
    "doing so slightly changes the averages for the smc and ic  10 , but does not significantly alter the results .",
    "thus , a consistent and uniform analysis of the available data for resolved gmcs shows no evidence for an increasing  with decreasing metallicity .",
    "we note that this is unlike the scenario mentioned before , where similar gradients in radiation field and metallicity conspire to keep  approximately constant in the disks of the milky way or m  33 . here",
    "we have galaxies ( and particular gmc complexes ) that simultaneously have a higher - than - galactic radiation field and a lower - than - galactic metallicity , yet a very similar for their resolved gmcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we emphasize that these results correspond to the resolved . as we discussed in ",
    "[ calibrations ] , fir observations show that in galaxies such as the smc , co - bright cores are likely embedded in extended envelopes of  that do not emit in co @xcite .",
    "the global molecular gas content of a galaxy relative to its co luminosity may well steeply scale with its dust - to - gas ratio or metallicity , as it is strongly suggested by the available data on a few of these objects @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that the structures that we are able to identify as individual gmcs by means of their co emission have co - to-  conversion factors ( as well as larson relations ) that are approximately galactic , independent of their nebular metallicities .",
    "we can understand the joint results from the co and dust - continuum observations in the following terms : in a low - metallicity environment such as the smc , co - bright clouds are the innermost portions of considerably larger h@xmath0 structures mostly devoid of co emission .",
    "this scenario was suggested by @xcite and @xcite for the smc and is consistent with calculations of the effect of metallicity on the placement of the photodissociation fronts @xcite .",
    "it also has been suggested as the situation in outer galaxy disks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but see also @xcite for a recent determination of h@xmath0 formation rates in diffuse gas ) .",
    "it appears that ( as described for milky way gmcs by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) these inner portions approximately follow the larson relations and , to co observers capable of resolving them , they appear very similar to galactic gmcs .",
    "thus an approximately galactic  factor correctly estimates the mass of the co - bright core , but underestimates considerably the mass of h@xmath0 in the entire gmc . in this scenario",
    "the bulk of the mass has to be located in an envelope , surrounding the co emission .",
    "this requires that the radiation field responsible for the photodissociation of co be external to the cloud , and that  be effective at self - shielding even in an environment with low dust - to - gas ratio and consequently reduced  formation rate .",
    "column ( 11 ) in table [ bimatab ] gives brightness temperature at the cloud peak , @xmath307 , for each gmc , a quantity set by the excitation temperature , optical depth , and filling factor of co. although not part of the larson relations , this quantity is accessible in extragalactic gmcs and may yield insight into the physical state of clouds .    for galactic clouds",
    "the average brightness temperature is @xmath308  k @xcite .",
    "many of our data exhibit notably lower @xmath307 than this .",
    "this might indicate either lower excitation temperatures or a different optical depth of co , due to e.g. a lower cloudlet filling factor or other geometry well below our resolution .",
    "however , the simplest explanation is that we observe gmcs with a ( spatially ) large beam and that beam dillution , i.e. a low co filling factor within the beam , lowers @xmath307 in more distant systems .",
    "figure [ fig_tpeak ] shows that beam dilution indeed explains many of the the low observed @xmath307 .",
    "we plot the mean and full range of @xmath307 for each galaxy as a function of the spatial resolution of the data .",
    "we also show the expected @xmath307 for the case of a uniform brightness cloud with fwhm size 40  pc ( dashed line ) .",
    "the dashed line is consistent with most of our data , including both local group galaxies ( the lmc , ic  10 , m  33 , and m  31 ) and more distant dwarfs ( ngc  2976 , ngc  4214 , ngc  4605 ) . for the more distant dwarfs ,",
    "this highlights that while we resolve large ( @xmath309  pc ) structures in the co , these are likely blends of several gmcs .",
    "a few extreme values of @xmath307 can not be immediately explained by beam dilution .",
    "ngc  3077 appears unusually bright in co when observed with both bima and ovro , perhaps a sign the that ongoing starburst at the heart of this galaxy leads to higher excitation temperatures .",
    "ngc  4449 shows a similarly high @xmath307 . in ngc  185 , ngc  205 ,",
    "ngc  1569 , and the smc ( n83 ) @xmath307 is low despite excellent spatial resolution . in these galaxies ,",
    "molecular clouds are physically smaller , have lower area filling fractions of co emission , and/or have lower kinetic temperatures than in large galaxies .",
    "the first two might be caused by the low abundance of co or by diminished shielding from dust as discussed in previous sections .",
    "a lower kinetic temperature remains a possibility , but is not supported by existing studies at least in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "clouds in the smc are indeed physically smaller than in most other galaxies , but that effect does not completely account for the observed differences ( see dotted line in figure [ fig_tpeak ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the co emission has a lower area filling fraction : clouds in some of these galaxies are porous structures , where co arises only from high @xmath310 clumps .",
    "we discussed in  [ sizelw ] the peculiar situation of several of the least massive clouds in this study , mostly those belonging to the smc , that systematically exhibit velocity dispersions that are too small for their sizes according to the galactic _ size - line width _ relation .",
    "we noted that , despite their small sizes , these objects display exactly the opposite behavior from that observed in the outer galaxy , where small clouds are confined by the external pressure @xcite .    under the assumption of turbulence - supported clouds in virial equilibrium following a @xmath311 relation ,",
    "the fact that many smc and a few ic  10 clouds lie a factor of two in @xmath2 below the _ size - line width _ relation implies that their surface densities are four times lower than galactic clouds , yielding @xmath312 .",
    "recall that , for milky way clouds , the observed surface density translates into a visual extinction @xmath29 through the cloud . in low - metallicity galaxies such as the smc and ic  10 , where the dust - to - gas ratio is lower than in the milky way by at least a factor similar to their heavy - element deficit",
    ", a reduction by a factor of 4 in surface density is compounded by another factor of @xmath37 in the dust - to - gas ratio implying that we would expect extinctions of order @xmath313 through the cloud , or @xmath314 at the cloud center .",
    "we do not expect bright @xmath15co emission at such low extinction , where most co molecules would be photodissociated .",
    "it is possible , however , that gmcs in the smc have a considerably lower co area filling fraction than their galactic counterparts .",
    "thus , although the average surface densities and corresponding extinctions are are too low to allow the formation of co , it still exists in small , well shielded clumps within these structures .",
    "we have discussed in the previous section that there is some evidence along these lines , since clouds in the smc indeed have lower brightness temperatures suggestive of smaller co area filling fractions .    alternatively ,",
    "if the hypothesis of virialized clouds supported chiefly by turbulent motions is not valid , the smc and ic  10 gmcs that fall under the _ size - line width _ relation show a deficit of turbulent kinetic energy with respect to similar size milky way clouds .",
    "since galactic clouds are supported against collapse by a combination of turbulence and magnetic fields with turbulence lending the main support on the large scales @xcite , this apparent deficit of turbulent energy would translate into rapid collapse and subsequent star formation in a free - fall timescale ( @xmath315 myr , where @xmath316 is the mean volume density of the cloud ; @xcite ) unless there is significant cloud support provided by a magnetic field that is proportionally larger ( or better coupled to the cloud material , perhaps due to larger cloud ionization fractions ) than in otherwise similar galactic structures .    to test this hypothesis",
    "it is necessary to obtain cloud mass determinations independent of virial assumptions .",
    "this is usually attained by employing the  factor , modeling molecular line emission , or using measurements of the dust continuum and assuming a dust - to - gas ratio and grain emissivity .",
    "the latter method was used by @xcite , who determined masses for several molecular clouds in the sw region of the smc .",
    "these authors found the dust - derived masses for these clouds to be , on average , twice as large as their virial masses . under the assumption of long - lived clouds",
    ", they attributed this fact to additional magnetic support by a @xmath317 @xmath260 g field .",
    "this field is similar to that present in smaller structures ( a few parsecs in size with masses @xmath318 m@xmath19 ) in the milky way @xcite . along similar lines ,",
    "@xcite modeling of the far - infrared emission in the smc to derive molecular gas surface densities found a mean surface density of molecular gas @xmath319  on 46 pc scales , very similar to that observed in milky way gmcs .",
    "these observations suggest that surface densities in the smc are higher than what would be implied by cloud line widths under the assumption of turbulence - supported virialized clouds .",
    "we argued in  [ ourxco ] that the joint co and dust continuum data in the smc is best understood in terms of extended co - faint envelopes surrounding co - bright cores . in this interpretation ,",
    "part ( possibly a large part ) of the mass or surface density obtained by dust continuum modeling is contributed by the extended envelope , and the mass of this envelope may not be accurately reflected in the kinematics of the co - bright core .",
    "consequently , the high dust - derived surface densities and low observed co velocity dispersions may not necessarily require an enhanced magnetic support .",
    "we expect that further joint analysis of high spatial resolution fir and co observations will shed light on the existence of extended  envelopes @xcite .",
    "we present and discuss a comprehensive set of high spatial resolution observations of co in low mass galaxies , obtained by a combination of interferometer and single - dish instruments .",
    "although the data are heterogeneous , we analyze them in a consistent manner to obtain gmc sizes , velocity dispersions , and luminosities .",
    "the analysis is performed using the algorithm described by @xcite , which does a good job at removing the biases due to dissimilar resolution and signal - to - noise .",
    "we compare this uniform dataset of resolved extragalactic molecular cloud properties against those of gmcs in the three disk galaxies in the local group .",
    "to do so , we analyze the interferometric maps of m  31 @xcite , m  33 @xcite , and the sample of galactic gmcs discussed by @xcite .",
    "the main result of this study is that , remarkably , _ there are only small differences between co - bright gmcs in the milky way and gmcs in galaxies with metallicities as low as @xmath320 subject to a variety of physical conditions_. our sample of extragalactic gmcs follows approximately the same _ size - line width _ , _ luminosity - size _ , and _ luminosity - line width _ relations as galactic clouds",
    ". such uniformity may be in part responsible for the observed invariance of the stellar initial mass function in galaxies . in any case",
    ", this result underscores that the galactic larson relations provide a remarkably good description of co - bright giant molecular clouds independent of their environment , at least in the range of environments explored by this study .",
    "although the larson relations are approximately galactic there are some significant departures .",
    "gmcs in dwarf galaxies tend to be slightly larger than gmcs in the milky way , m  31 , and m  33 for a given co luminosity or velocity dispersion .",
    "the largest departures occur in the smc , the galaxy with the lowest metallicity of the sample .",
    "a possible interpretation , viable for most of our objects , is that gmcs in small galaxies have on average a surface density of @xmath321  rather than the canonical @xmath322 m@xmath323  pc@xmath28 observed in the galaxy . in the case of the smc , however , the implied surface densities , and consequently the central extinction in the gmcs , would be too low to expect bright co emission .",
    "we explore three possibilities : these clouds are transient structures not supported by turbulence and will collapse in a few myr , or else they are supported by magnetic fields in a larger proportion than similar galactic clouds , or maybe the kinematics of the co cores do not reflect the presence of massive  envelopes .",
    "analysis of the properties of our sample of extragalactic gmcs shows that they do not accord with simple predictions from the theory of photoionization - regulated star formation @xcite . in the framework of this theory , clouds in lower metallicity environments",
    "will have larger surface densities to attain similar extinction in their central regions , which can then decouple from the magnetic field and collapse .",
    "such a trend would be evident in the coefficient of the _ size - line width _ relation , as expressed by equation [ photosf ] . as fig .",
    "[ met_beta ] illustrates , we see no evidence for such a trend in our data .",
    "we point out four possible caveats with these results : 1 ) it is possible that our observations do not probe the spatial scales on which these enhancements may occur .",
    "2 ) perhaps other parameters that enter in the theory ( such as the cosmic ray ionization rate , for example ) change from galaxy to galaxy in a manner that conspires to keep the coefficient of the _ size - line width _ relation approximately constant .",
    "3 ) maybe our identification of @xmath255 with metallicity is incorrect and we sample a smaller range of conditions than we think we do . or , 4 ) the co kinematics do not trace the full potential of the cloud . in any case",
    ", we find a @xmath324 product that is approximately constant or even decreasing for decreasing metallicity , contrary to expectations .",
    "finally , we address the matter of the dependency of the co - to - conversion factor , , on metallicity .",
    "we find that the extragalactic gmcs in our analysis agree very well with the galactic _ luminosity - virial mass _ relation .",
    "consequently , in our study of resolved gmcs we find no measurable change of : over a factor of 5 in metallicity most of our galaxies are compatible with a galactic @xmath23  within a factor of two , and there is no discernible trend with metallicity .",
    "we emphasize , however , that this measurement is relevant on the scales of the individual , co - bright gmcs .",
    "studies in the fir and at millimeter - waves in low metallicity environments ( particularly the smc ) suggest that these clouds are embedded in larger  envelopes that are not traced by co emission but contain an appreciable mass of molecular gas , at least in the case of the smc @xcite .",
    "these fir results are approximately consistent with virial estimates obtained on larger scales than the ones discussed in this paper @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the fir and co observations can be simultaneously understood in the following terms : in low metallicity gas bright co emission is relegated to the density peaks .",
    "observations that resolve those density peaks show properties that are similar to those of milky way gmcs  that is the result of this study , and it is supported by studies of the structure of milky way gmcs @xcite . on larger scales ,",
    "the cloud - to - cloud velocity dispersion as well as the dust opacity suggest that there is a large mass of likely molecular material that is not accounted for by the co intensity .",
    "such regions would be co - bright in objects of higher metallicity .",
    "studying the resolved properties of extragalactic gmcs is a challenging undertaking with the current generation of instruments , particularly for clouds in co - faint dwarf galaxies . in the near future",
    "the deployment of the alma interferometer will make it possible to obtain more precise measurements on larger samples at farther distances .",
    "studies such as the one presented here suffer from an important bias : we can only perform them on the brightest co peaks .",
    "the detection of clouds as faint as those in the smc in co , for example , is currently impossible beyond the immediate neighborhood of the local group .",

    "<S> we use these results to investigate metallicity trends in the cloud average column density and virial co - to - h@xmath0 factor . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these measurements do not accord with simple predictions from photoionization - regulated star formation theory , although this could be due to the fact that we do not sample small enough spatial scales or the full gravitational potential of the molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the virial co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor in co - bright gmcs is very similar to galactic , and that the excursions do not show a measurable metallicity trend . </S>",
    "<S> we contrast these results with estimates of molecular mass based on far - infrared measurements obtained for the small magellanic cloud , which systematically yield larger masses , and interpret this discrepancy as arising from large h@xmath0 envelopes that surround the co - bright cores . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that gmcs identified on the basis of their co emission are a unique class of object that exhibit a remarkably uniform set of properties from galaxy to galaxy . </S>"
