    "the status of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) as a cornerstone of the hot big bang cosmology rests on the agreement between the theoretical predictions and the primordial abundances of the light elements deuterium ( d ) , helium-3 ( he ) , helium-4 ( he ) , and lithium-7 ( li ) inferred from observational data ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "comparisons of this type often rely on models of galactic chemical and/or stellar evolution in order to associate the observed abundances of these light elements at the present epoch with their predicted primordial values .",
    "recently the confrontation between prediction and observation has come under stricter scrutiny as it appeared that the primordial abundance of deuterium inferred from ism / solar data was smaller than its predicted abundance - the value of which follows from requiring that the standard big bang model predictions for he are in good agreement with the abundance inferred from observations of metal - poor extragalactic regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "very recent measurements of the deuterium abundance along the lines - of - sight to high - redshift qsos(@xcite ) , along with a reanalysis of the he data in light of new observations(@xcite ) , increase the tension between prediction and observation .",
    "the role of li in these comparisons has been minor due to the large uncertainty in the estimate of the amount of lithium destruction during the lifetimes of ( , metal poor ) halo stars which could accomodate primordial lithium abundances ranging from the observed plateau valuek and [ fe / h ] @xmath5 is nearly independent of metallicity ( @xmath6 = 2.25\\pm 0.1 $ ] , where @xmath7 = 12 +   \\log y_x$ ] with @xmath8 the number ratio of x to hydrogen ) and , hence , is referred to as a  plateau \" . ]",
    "( no depletion ) up to a factor of ten larger .",
    "this range in possible depletion factors is equally compatible with primordial lithium abundances which correspond to either `` low deuterium '' ( which favors a primordial lithium abundance a factor of 3 higher than the plateau value ) , or the observed he ( which favors the plateau value ) .",
    "the arguments in favor of minimal lithium depletion are the flatness of the lithium abundance plateau ( at low metallicity and high temperature ) with respect to both metallicity and temperature and the low dispersion in the lithium abundance at fixed t@xmath0 .",
    "this was generally consistent with `` standard '' stellar models ( , models without rotation which burn lithium via convection during pre - main sequence evolution ) which predicted little depletion ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are however some specific areas of disagreement in the comparison of the halo star data with standard models",
    ". the observed dispersion may be greater than that predicted ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or not ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is a small population of highly overdepleted stars which appear normal except for li ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the trends with metal abundance appear to conflict with expectations from the models ( thorburn 1994 , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the overall agreement between standard stellar evolution theory and observations in halo stars is good enough that nonstandard models would probably not be invoked to explain this data set .",
    "therefore many investigators have adopted the reasonable assumption that the observed lithium abundances are close to the primordial value .",
    "the overall properties of li depletion in standard models have been extensively studied ( for a review see @xcite ) and there are some model independent predictions : there is partial li depletion in the pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) , little or no main sequence ( ms ) depletion for stars hotter than about 5500 k , and there should be little or no dispersion in the li abundance at a given t@xmath0 in clusters .",
    "unfortunately , the observational data obtained from halo stars does not serve as a good diagnostic for these models since the initial abundance is not known and we have no information on the history of the li abundance . instead",
    ", one can look to the sun and open clusters , systems with a nearly uniform initial lithium abundance ( [ li ] = 3.2 to 3.4 ) where detailed abundance data is available as a function of mass , age , and composition .",
    "these data provide stringent tests of theoretical models and it has been known for quite some time ( , see @xcite and @xcite ) that standard models fail these tests .",
    "the disagreement between the data and standard models has increased as both the observational data and the standard theoretical models have improved .",
    "the open cluster data provide clear evidence that the li abundance decreases with increasing age on the ms , contrary to the standard model prediction that the convective zones of these hot ( @xmath9 5500k ) stars are not deep enough to destroy li on the ms .",
    "in addition , there is strong evidence for a dispersion in abundance at fixed t@xmath0 and unexpected mass - dependent effects , such as the strong depletion seen in mid - f stars relative to both hotter and cooler stars ( the `` li dip '' of @xcite - for extensive reviews of this issue , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . for standard models , these features can not be explained by variations in the input physics ( , opacities ) ; rather , they indicate the operation of physical processes not usually included in standard models . by extension , these processes could also be operating in the stars .",
    "another potentially useful diagnostic of lithium depletion can be found in globular clusters .",
    "clusters provide samples which are homogeneous in age and composition , so one would expect a smaller dispersion in a cluster sample than in a field star sample .",
    "this is certainly the case for stars : field stars do show a larger dispersion than open cluster stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent observations of li in globular cluster subgiant and turnoff stars show the opposite trend and create some serious difficulties for the minimal li depletion scenario for metal poor stars ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are clear star - to - star differences in m92 ; out of 3 stars observed with very similar color , 2 have lithium abundances well below the plateau value . in ngc 6397 , 20 stars near the turnoff were observed . for 7 with identical b - v color",
    ", there is a scatter of a factor of 2 - 3 in lithium abundance .",
    "therefore a standard model treatment of the halo field stars must explain why the lithium abundances in globular clusters , but not in field stars , are anomalous .",
    "the disagreement between the lithium abundances and the predictions of standard stellar models has stimulated investigation of nonstandard stellar models .",
    "the most prominent explanations are mixing ( either from rotation or waves ) , microscopic diffusion , and mass loss ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for g and k stars , microscopic diffusion and mass loss",
    "are not likely explanations ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which leaves mixing as a logical candidate . mixing induced by rotation can explain many of the overall properties of the data .",
    "rotational mixing can , on relatively long timescales , mix material from the base of the convective zone to interior regions of the star where lithium can be burned ; both the rotation rate and the li depletion rate decrease with increased age ; and a distribution of initial rotation rates can produce a distribution of li depletions and thus a dispersion in abundance at fixed t@xmath0 .    although models with rotational mixing have the qualitative properties needed to explain the pop i and pop ii data , two classes of objections have been raised : 1 ) the uniqueness of the solutions and adequacy of the physical model ; and 2 ) discrepancies in the quantitative comparison of observation and theory .",
    "rotational models require an understanding of the angular momentum as a function of radius and as a function of time .",
    "there have been persistent difficulties in reproducing the surface rotation rates as a function of mass and time in open clusters ( @xcite , b ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in addition",
    ", models with internal angular momentum transport from hydrodynamic mechanisms , such as the ones used in this paper , predict more rapid core rotation in the sun than is compatible with helioseismology data ( @xcite , krishnamurthi et al .",
    "1997a ( kpbs ) , @xcite )",
    ". either of these difficulties could potentially affect the degree of mixing in the models .    models with rotational mixing predict that a range of initial angular momenta will generate a range of lithium depletion rates and therefore a dispersion in abundance among stars of the same mass , composition , and age .",
    "however , the difficulty in reproducing the angular momentum evolution of low mass stars has made quantifying the predicted dispersion difficult , and therefore only qualitative estimates have been made ( , see @xcite(pkd ) , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "there have also been mismatches between the mean trend inferred from the data and from all classes of theoretical models .",
    "chaboyer & demarque ( 1994 ) , for example , concluded that the observed mean trend of lithium abundance with t@xmath0 in metal - poor halo stars was not reproduced in _ any _ class of models , be they standard , rotational , or with diffusion .",
    "there are also cases , such as the cool stars in young open clusters , where the observed dispersion is large but the rotational models predict little , if any , dispersion .",
    "the case for or against standard model lithium depletion is not as clear cut when we consider halo stars .",
    "it is argued that models with significant rotationally induced depletion could not produce a flat plateau with limited dispersion about the mean plateau abundance ( , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , it was expected that such models would destroy far too much li ( @xcite ) in conflict with the observation of li in hd 84937 ( see section 4.2 ) . on the other hand , standard ( convective burning )",
    "models show lithium depletion trends contrary to the data . at minimum",
    "the mechanisms responsible for the li pattern need to be identified and shown to not affect stars .",
    "it is difficult to construct a model where the nonstandard effects completely cancel for stars while still retaining consistency with the data .",
    "models with microscopic diffusion predict modest li depletion in plateau halo stars . in general",
    "these same models predict that the timescale for changes in the surface li abundance decreases with increased mass ; this produces a downward curvature in the li - t@xmath0 relationship at high temperatures which is not observed .",
    "mass loss can counteract this trend ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in either case , the net effect is modest depletion at the 0.2 dex level .",
    "rotational mixing can also suppress diffusion ( chaboyer & demarque 1994 , @xcite ) .",
    "the cancellation of different effects still requires at least some mean li depletion in the halo stars . in a recent preprint",
    "@xcite note that although the surface li abundance varies strongly with mass in diffusive models , the peak subsurface abundance does not ( note that the height of the peak is not preserved in models which include mixing ) .",
    "they then use the height of that peak to constrain the absolute li abundance , arguing that the appropriate mass loss strips each star down to the region that contains this peak li abundance .",
    "the survival of li is also problematic in unmixed models with sufficient mass loss to expose the peak abundance ; in a model of ours which can be compared to figure 1 in @xcite , li drops to half its surface value in the outer 0.01 solar masses , well below the comparable mass content in the li preserving region of 0.02 solar masses and also the peak in the @xcite model .",
    "further , it is disturbing to use a class of models which do not include a fundamental characteristic of stars , namely , rotation , when that property has been shown to be capable of affecting the issue being studied .    in our view",
    "the most serious source of uncertainty in models with rotational mixing has been the understanding of the angular momentum evolution of low mass stars .",
    "we will show that many of the difficulties in reconciling observation and theory are resolved when models that are consistent with the rotation data in open clusters are used . in order to make definitive predictions of the amount of rotational mixing , it is necessary to follow the stellar angular momentum histories which requires knowledge of the initial distribution of rotation velocities along with an angular momentum loss law .",
    "there has been significant recent progress in constructing theoretical models consistent with the rotation data in young open clusters ( kpbs ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . with the latest generation of models",
    ", we can both infer the distribution of initial conditions and place strong constraints on the surface rotation as a function of time .",
    "this enables us to quantify the expected dispersion in lithium abundance and greatly reduces the sensitivity of the model predictions to uncertainties in the input physics . those models which accurately reproduce the lithium abundances observed in open clusters",
    "can then be used to predict lithium depletion in halo stars .",
    "the general trend is that these `` open cluster normalized '' rotation models for halo stars predict more lithium depletion than do the standard models but less depletion than that predicted by earlier studies of rotational mixing with a less sophisticated treatment of angular momentum evolution .",
    "our goal in this paper is to constrain the amount of lithium depletion in stars using several observables : ( 1 ) an estimate of the halo star initial rotation rate distribution as derived from open clusters , ( 2 ) the absence of large dispersion in the observed lithium abundances of the `` plateau '' stars , ( 3 ) the li abundance and/or the li / li abundance ratio in hd 84937 .",
    "we argue that , individually and in combination , these observables point to halo star lithium depletion of at least 0.2 dex ( following from the open cluster data ) but no more than 0.4 dex ( a consequence of the narrowness of the plateau and of the li considerations ) .",
    "based on the observational data we can then infer the primordial lithium abundance and compare and contrast it with that predicted by standard bbn for consistency with the inferred primordial abundances of d and/or he .",
    "in standard stellar models , lithium depletion is a strong function of mass and composition ; it also depends on the input physics , particularly the opacities and model atmospheres used to specify the surface boundary condition . in our models",
    "the standard model physics is the same as described in kpbs ( @xcite ) : namely , interior opacities from opal ( @xcite ) , low - t opacities and model atmospheres at solar abundance from @xcite,@xcite ) ; nuclear reaction rates from @xcite , including the @xcite li(p , @xmath10 ) cross - section ; yale eos ; a solar calibrated mixing length , and @xmath11 .",
    "chaboyer & demarque ( 1994 ) noted that unusual li - t@xmath0 trends for cool metal - poor stars occurred in models using the kurucz atmospheres and could be lessened by using a grey atmosphere .",
    "we therefore ran halo star models with grey atmospheres and a mixing length of 1.25 as obtained for solar models constructed under the same assumptions .",
    "stellar models which include rotational mixing require additional input physics beyond standard stellar models .",
    "the important new ingredients include :    1 .   a distribution of initial angular momenta 2 .   a prescription for angular momentum loss 3 .",
    "a prescription for the internal transport of angular momentum and the associated mixing in radiative regions 4 .",
    "the impact of rotation on the structure of the model .",
    "there have been important changes in the treatment of the first three ingredients since the study of rotational mixing in halo dwarfs by @xcite ; in this section we discuss the ingredients of the current set of models and compare them with previous work .",
    "the treatment of angular momentum evolution in this set of models is the same as kpbs .",
    "the structural effects of rotation have been computed using the method of @xcite , and are small for low mass stars which experience angular momentum loss .",
    "the studies of lithium depletion in the presence of rotationally induced mixing by @xcite ( the sun ) , pkd ( open cluster stars ) , and pdd ( halo stars ) all used a range of initial rotation rates in the pre - ms from the measured rotation velocities of young t tauri stars ( 10 - 60 km / s ) at a typical reference age of 1 myr . no interaction between accretion disks and",
    "the protostar was included ; the entire range of initial conditions was generated from the range in the initial rotation velocity .",
    "this caused some difficulty in reproducing the observed range in rotation ( a factor of 20 in young open clusters ) , especially since the higher angular momentum loss rate in rapid rotators acted to reduce the range in initial rotation rates .",
    "this approach was also used by chaboyer ( 1995a , b ) for the sun and open cluster stars respectively and by chaboyer & demarque ( 1994 ) for halo stars , although these papers used a different angular momentum loss law than the earlier work .",
    "as protostars evolve their moment of inertia decreases ; this would produce an increase in rotation rate with decreased luminosity .",
    "in contrast , the rotation periods of classical t tauri stars appear to be nearly uniform - they do not scale with luminosity as they would if the stars were conserving angular momentum as they contracted towards the main sequence ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "weak - lined t tauri stars , which are thought to be protostars without significant accretion disks , have much shorter rotation periods . this behavior would be expected if there were an accretion disk regulating the rotation of the central object and spinup only occurred when the disk is no longer magnetically coupled to the protostar ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this revised picture",
    "there is a constant surface rotation rate while there is a sufficiently massive disk around the central object ; stars which detach from their disks earlier experience a larger change in angular velocity as they contract to the main sequence than those which detach from their disk later ( and are only free to begin to spin up when their moment of inertia is smaller ) .",
    "this disk - locking hypothesis leads to a larger range in rotation rates for models of young open cluster stars , in better agreement with the data , and explains the very slow rotation of the majority of young stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; kpbs ) .",
    "these differences in the initial conditions lead to interesting consequences for the lithium depletion pattern .",
    "although the initial rotation periods are comparable to those used in the earlier studies , the inclusion of star - disk coupling implies that the ms angular momentum is much lower for models with long disk lifetimes than it would be if the disks were absent .",
    "disk lifetimes of 3 myr are needed to match the rotation rates of the slow rotators in young clusters .",
    "the mean depletion for the majority of stars is therefore significantly lower than in previous studies because most young stars are slow rotators and the degree of mixing decreases for models with lower ms angular momentum .",
    "pksd , pkd , and pdd all used a loss law of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the angular velocity ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies greater angular momentum loss for rapid rotators than for slow rotators .",
    "however , models of this type do not reproduce the rapid rotators seen in young open clusters ; the spin down of high angular momentum objects is too severe ( pkd ) . on both theoretical and observational grounds ,",
    "a more realistic functional form for the loss law is    @xmath14    and @xmath15 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath16 is the angular velocity at which the angular momentum loss rate saturates ; @xmath16 can be estimated from several observable quantities , thought to be correlated with surface magnetic field strength , which saturate at 5 - 20 times the solar rotation period ( see @xcite , @xcite for reviews and discussions of recent work ) .",
    "a loss law which saturates at high rotation rates allows rapid rotation to survive into the early main sequence phase ; a loss law of this form was adopted by chaboyer ( 1995a , b ) and chaboyer & demarque ( 1994 ) .",
    "the observational data indicate that the duration of the rapid rotator phase is a function of mass in the sense that rapid rotation survives longer in lower mass stars .",
    "there is also indirect observational evidence for a mass - dependent saturation threshold ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "models where the saturation threshold scales with the convective overturn time scale can reproduce the observed mass dependent spin down pattern .",
    "we adopt the mass - dependent saturation threshold of kpbs ,    @xmath17    where the convective overturn time scale @xmath18 as a function of zams t@xmath0 was taken from the 200 myr isochrones of kim & demarque ( 1996 ; kd ) .",
    "@xcite only considered models at solar abundance , and we would need to recalibrate the kpbs models if we used a time and abundance dependent overturn timescale for the models . a comparison of the convection zone depth ( as a function of t@xmath0 , z , and age ) in the tables of pkd and pdd indicates that at young ages the convection zone depth at a given t@xmath0 , and therefore the overturn time scale , depends only weakly on metal abundance .",
    "the value of @xmath16 is important primarily in the early main sequence .",
    "we therefore evolved standard halo star models to an age of 200 myr and used the same @xmath18 as a function of t@xmath0 for the metal - poor models as reported by kd for the solar abundance models .",
    "we will consider models with a mass , composition , and time dependent overturn time scale in a future paper in preparation ( @xcite ) . a loss law with a mass - dependent saturation threshold acts preferentially to suppress rapid rotation in the more massive stars , unlike the constant saturation threshold adopted by chaboyer & demarque ( 1994 ) .",
    "this reduces both the absolute depletion and the dispersion of lithium abundances in hotter halo plateau stars relative to cooler plateau stars .",
    "the treatment of angular momentum transport is the same as in kpbs ; a detailed review of the time scale estimates can be found in pinsonneault ( 1997 ) .",
    "we consider internal angular momentum transport by hydrodynamic mechanisms alone , and do not include potentially important mechanisms such as gravity waves ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and magnetic fields ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in previous work",
    "the degree of mixing was found to be insensitive to the assumptions about internal angular momentum transport ( pkd ; pdd ; @xcite , b ) . @xcite and @xcite obtained similar depletion patterns in models with solid body rotation , and @xcite reported similar results in models with magnetic fields and hydrodynamic mechanisms .",
    "this can be understood because the diffusion coefficients for angular momentum transport are actually largely determined by the balance between the surface boundary condition ( the applied torque ) and the flux of angular momentum from below a given shell .",
    "theory gives an estimate of the ratio of the diffusion coefficients for mixing to those for angular momentum , which is related to the existence of anisotropic turbulence in stellar interiors ( @xcite ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficients for mixing are calibrated on the sun , but our lack of information on the rotational history of the sun requires an exploration of models with varying solar initial conditions .",
    "we have taken the pleiades @xmath19 data used in kpbs and applied a statistical correction of 4/@xmath20 to all of the data points to correct for inclination angle effects .",
    "a grid of solar composition models with a range of accretion disk lifetimes was constructed and evolved to the age of the pleiades .",
    "we interpolated in the grid to map the distribution of measured rotation velocities onto a distribution of accretion disk lifetimes .",
    "a histogram of the number of stars as a function of disk lifetimes is presented in figure 1a .",
    "this distribution of initial conditions was used to infer the distribution of lithium depletion factors for different solar disk lifetimes in all of the following discussion .",
    "we then generated a grid of halo star models using the same input physics ; we compare the rotation velocities of pleiades stars to those for halo composition stars with the same disk lifetimes in figure 1b .",
    "the distribution of initial conditions will be important for the remainder of our results , so we begin by discussing the properties of the pleiades sample first .",
    "we then compare the angular momentum properties of our halo and solar abundance models .",
    "the measured rotation rates in the pleiades are subject to ambiguity because we measure @xmath19 rather than the true rotation rate ; the true rotation velocities will therefore be higher on average than the @xmath19 values .",
    "in addition , there are a significant number of upper limits in the data set ; this technique would therefore miss any population of very slow rotators .",
    "such stars , if present , would have less lithium depletion than our technique would permit , and they would therefore influence the predicted range in lithium depletion factors . finally , there is the possibility that the distribution of initial conditions could depend on environment ; , the assumption that halo stars had the same distribution of disk lifetimes as the pleiades , or that the pleiades is the same as other open clusters , may be incorrect .",
    "a distribution of @xmath19 values can in principle be inverted to infer the true distribution of velocities ( @xcite ) , but the technique requires a large sample and we would lose the information on the mass dependence of rotation which is important for our purposes . although @xmath21 can be small , it will be close to 1 for the large majority of stars ; only 1/7 of the sample will have @xmath22 for a random distribution of inclination angles .",
    "furthermore , the young open clusters have a small population of rapid rotators and a large population of slow rotators ; 13 out of the 91 stars in the pleiades sample have @xmath23 km / s , and 7 have @xmath19 between 20 and 40 km / s . therefore ,",
    "only a small fraction of the low @xmath19 systems are intrinsically rapid rotators seen pole - on . for these reasons",
    "we have therefore chosen to apply an average statistical correction to the data , and do not believe that the shape of the distribution in figure 1 will be greatly altered by inclination angle effects .",
    "rotation periods are not affected by @xmath24 , and they provide an alternate means of estimating the distribution of initial conditions . although the present rotation period samples are much smaller than the @xmath19 samples , the number of stars with measured rotation periods is growing and it may soon be possible to use them in well - studied systems such as the pleiades .",
    "the issue of the lower envelope of rotation is a more serious concern ; there is a bias in the @xmath19 sample against detecting truly slow rotators .",
    "we have a series of reasons for believing that the absence of very slow rotators is real .",
    "first , stellar rotation periods can be measured for stars without the uncertainty introduced by the inclination angle ; much slower rotation rates can be measured with this technique than with @xmath19 data .",
    "long rotation periods are not found in the pleiades ( @xcite ) and are very rare in the t tauri population ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which suggests that any population of very slow rotators is small .",
    "furthermore , even disks that last to the main sequence would only produce stars with rotation periods of order 10 days , very close to the rotation period corresponding to the @xmath19 limits .",
    "we would therefore require stars which are locked to their disks with a period much longer than that seen in t tauri stars and with a long disk lifetime to produce a population of ultra - slow rotators large enough to affect our results .",
    "finally , progressively younger open clusters have a smaller number of upper limits than older systems ( there are fewer in @xmath10 per than in the pleiades ) , and the lower envelope of rotation is resolved in the youngest systems ( ic 2391 and ic 2602 ) .",
    "recent studies of rotation in the pleiades are also consistent with this conclusion ( @xcite ) .",
    "the universality of the distribution in figure 1a is another important question .",
    "kpbs found that the distributions of disk lifetimes needed for the different young open clusters were consistent with one another , in the sense that the slow rotator distribution peaked at similar disk lifetimes for systems of different ages .",
    "this does not guarantee that the same will hold true for systems that formed under different conditions , such as halo stars and globular cluster stars .",
    "the distribution of initial rotation rates can not be directly inferred in old systems because the surface rotation rates of stars converge as they age and lose angular momentum . even in a system as young as the hyades ( 600 myr ) the range in surface rotation rates is too small to permit a reliable estimate of the initial angular momentum of any given star .",
    "it is , however , at least a plausible starting point to ask whether the distribution of lithium abundances in different samples is _ consistent _ with the distribution of rotation rates seen in young open clusters such as the pleiades .",
    "one can in principle invert the question and ask what distribution of disk lifetimes is needed to produce a given distribution of lithium abundances .",
    "lithium depletion depends on the rotational history of a given star , and therefore the distribution of surface lithium abundances in old stars can be used to obtain information about the distribution of initial conditions in systems that are too old to provide direct information on the rotation rates .",
    "we will show that both the halo star and open cluster lithium depletion patterns are consistent with lithium depletion from rotational mixing and with being drawn from the same set of initial conditions .      for each pleiades star we can infer a disk lifetime ;",
    "in figure 1b we compare the rotation properties of halo star models with the same age , effective temperature , disk lifetime , and rotation physics ( angular momentum loss law and angular momentum tranport prescription ) .",
    "we did not run halo star models with effective temperatures as low as the bulk of the pleiades sample , since these stars would not be on the halo lithium plateau ; we have therefore only shown the t@xmath0 range where the two samples overlap .",
    "there are some important features of this comparison which will have implications for the lithium depletion pattern in open cluster and halo stars .",
    "first , the overall level of rotation is lower in the halo stars ; second , the range in rotation rates is smaller . both phenomena can be traced to differences in stellar structure , and the relative pattern is the same as described in pdd and in chaboyer & demarque ( 1994 ) .    at a given t@xmath0",
    "a halo star will have a lower total mass and moment of inertia ; for the same amount of angular momentum loss the halo star will therefore spin down more rapidly .",
    "rapid rotators lose more angular momentum than slow rotators , which causes their surface rotation rates to converge at late ages .",
    "in addition , the convergence to similar surface rotation rates occurs more quickly in the halo stars because of their smaller moments of inertia .",
    "the diffusion coefficients for mixing depend on both the absolute rotation rates and the internal angular velocity gradients ; both are smaller in halo stars than in solar composition stars of the same age and t@xmath0",
    ". the overall level of lithium depletion will therefore be lower in the halo star models .",
    "in addition , a range in surface rotation rates will produce a range in the degree of rotational mixing , and therefore a dispersion in surface lithium abundances . the smaller range in surface rotation rates for the halo star models will therefore produce a smaller dispersion in surface lithium abundance at fixed t@xmath0 .",
    "similar initial conditions will therefore produce different apparent lithium depletion patterns ; this is important because such differences are clearly seen in the observational data .",
    "our theoretical models can be used to predict lithium depletion in open cluster and halo stars . as discussed above",
    ", the observed distribution of rotation rates in young open clusters ( like the pleiades ) is mapped onto a distribution of initial rotation rates by use of an accretion disk model which , during the t tauri phase of its pre - main sequence evolution , locks the rotation period of the star at 10 days . a range in decoupling times for these accretion disks",
    "will then generate a range of rotation rates for stars on the main sequence as a function of time .",
    "the rotational properties of the models are calibrated on the rotational properties of the open cluster stars and solar models are required to reproduce the solar rotation rate at the age of the sun .",
    "this step is independent of the initial conditions for the sun because different disk lifetimes for solar models converge to identical surface rotation rates at the age of the sun .",
    "we then need a means of relating the diffusion coefficients for mixing to those for angular momentum ; the usual approach is to require that a solar model reproduce the solar surface lithium abundance at the age of the sun . because models with different disk lifetimes have different rotation histories , this step depends critically on the disk lifetime assigned to the sun .",
    "if the sun is assumed to have a typical rotation history then solar analogs will have lithium depletion comparable to that in the sun . on the other hand , if the sun was an unusually rapid rotator ( , had a shorter disk lifetime than most stars ) the majority of other stars will have less lithium depletion .",
    "we therefore ran solar calibrated models with the sun having disk lifetimes of 0 ( anomalous ) , 0.3 , and 1 ( `` typical '' ) myr ; these cases will be referred to as s0 , s0.3 , and s1 for the remainder of the text .",
    "the open cluster lithium data are fit poorly when the sun is assumed to have a disk lifetime longer than 1 myr ( see below ) .",
    "all of our solar disk lifetimes are shorter than the 3 myr required for typical stars ; this implies that the sun was a faster than average rotator in its youth and thus its rotation history was not `` typical '' , strictly speaking .",
    "the solar - calibrated models can then be used to predict the lithium depletion factor as a function of time for a given disk lifetime , mass , and composition .",
    "we then investigated the distribution of lithium depletion factors that would be produced by a given distribution of disk lifetimes . for each star we chose an initial condition at random from the pleiades distribution of disk lifetimes ; we show sample monte carlo runs for the four open clusters using two different solar calibrations ( s0 and s1 ) in figures 2 and 3 respectively . for each cluster",
    "all stars were assumed to start with the same initial lithium abundance : we chose [ li ] = 3.4 for the youngest open clusters and [ li ] = 3.3 for the sun and for m67 .",
    "standard model predictions for li in these clusters are shown as solid curves in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "note that some main sequence lithium depletion is demanded by the data and that the overall lithium depletion pattern as a function of age is in reasonably good agreement with the monte carlo simulations of the models with rotational mixing .",
    "variations in the initial rotation rates provide a natural explanation for dispersion in stellar surface li / h at fixed t@xmath0 .",
    "the predictions of the time dependence of lithium depletion due to rotational mixing matches the open cluster data best for the case where the sun was an unusually rapid rotator ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this s0 case corresponds to minimal lithium depletion and predicts modest dispersion in the open cluster lithium abundances . as the sun",
    "is made more typical ( , as its disk lifetime increases and zams rotation rate drops ) the overall depletion and dispersion become larger and the overall agreement with the data worsens .",
    "the intermediate - aged systems are the most sensitive discriminant ; the model predictions are similar in young systems and the old clusters have less data ( which is also less accurate ) .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the open cluster lithium depletion pattern will be presented in a paper in preparation ( @xcite ) ; for the purposes of this paper , we note that open cluster models constructed using the same technique that we have applied to halo stars are in overall agreement with the observed lithium depletion pattern .",
    "we can extend the pnk models , designed for rotational mixing in open clusters , to study lithium depletion in halo stars .",
    "unlike the open clusters , the halo stars have a range in metal abundance and age .",
    "we therefore begin with a discussion of the dependence of the lithium depletion pattern on the important components of our models : disk lifetimes , solar calibration , metal abundance , and age . in figure 4",
    "we show the effects of changes in all of these ingredients . in all panels",
    "the solid line is a base case which corresponds to models with a 3 myr disk lifetime , @xmath25=-2.3 $ ] , and an age of 12 gyr .",
    "\\1 . disk lifetimes",
    ".    a range in disk lifetime can produce significant variations in the predicted lithium depletion , especially for the rapid rotators .",
    "this will manifest itself as a dispersion in lithium abundance at fixed t@xmath0 ( top panel of figure 4 ) .",
    "however , the large majority of stars in the pleiades are slow rotators with disk lifetimes greater than 1 myr .",
    "as we will see below , the intrinsic range in depletion factors for slow rotators is very small ; , only the top 20% of the distribution will have depletion factors greater than or equal to the depletion factor of the 1 myr case see fig .",
    "1a ) , while the remainder will have depletion factors similar to that for the 3 myr case .",
    "the overall pattern that would be expected from the pleiades distribution of initial conditions is therefore a majority of stars with a small intrinsic range in abundance with a subpopulation ( corresponding to rapid rotators ) which is overdepleted with respect to the bulk of the stars .",
    "\\2 . solar calibration .",
    "the solar calibration sets the overall level of depletion in the models , and it will therefore have a strong influence on the derived primordial lithium abundance ( the second panel of figure 4 ) .",
    "once the solar calibration is set by the open cluster data , it should be the same for all stars ( @xcite ) , and in particular for halo stars .",
    "that is , we expect that the best fit to the halo star lithium abundances will correspond to the limit in which the sun is over - depleted in lithium relative to its counterparts ( the s0 case ) .",
    "we define the depletion factor @xmath26 as the ratio of the initial ( li / h ) to the current surface ( li / h ) .",
    "the halo star models of pdd predicted a value of @xmath26 close to 10 for plateau stars , with little dependence on the model parameters .",
    "this behavior is very different from that illustrated in figure 4 , and this can be traced to differences in the initial conditions and angular momentum loss law .",
    "pdd began with a modest range of initial angular momenta ( a factor of 10 ) and applied a loss law which caused a rapid convergence in the surface rotation rates .",
    "we begin with a wider range of initial angular momenta ( disk lifetimes from 0 myr to 10 myr will produce a factor of 16 range in angular momentum at an age of 10 myr ) .",
    "the loss law that is required by the rotation data also permits a wide range of rotation rates to persist for a longer period of time than it did in the models of pdd .",
    "the net result is a much larger possible range of lithium depletion factors .",
    "the models of pdd , for example , had a total range in log(@xmath26 ) of 0.25 dex at @xmath27 and [ fe / h]=@xmath28 , while the corresponding models in the current study have a range in depletion factors of 0.50 dex ( s0 ) to 1.30 dex ( s1 ) .",
    "because the possible range of lithium depletion factors is greatly increased , the choice of the initial conditions for the sun becomes correspondingly more important . in effect , the earlier generation of models had a small enough effective range in initial conditions that the sun was by definition a typical star and the typical depletion factors were therefore forced to be similar to those for the sun . if the sun is treated as a typical star with a disk lifetime of 3 myr , we recover the mean depletion factor of pdd ( @xmath29 ) with a much larger range of depletion factors than permitted by the data .",
    "metal abundance    models with different metal abundance differ in their overall lithium depletion factors by a modest amount , less than 0.1 dex change in lithium depletion per 1.0 dex change in [ fe / h ] .",
    "the overall trend is in the sense that the more metal - rich stars deplete more than the more metal - poor stars ; this is to be expected in light of the relative differences between solar composition and halo star rotational properties illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "this is opposite to the trend found by thorburn ( 1994 ) in the observational data , for which stars with lower metal abundance have , on average , slightly lower lithium abundances , by 0.1 dex in [ li ] for 1.0 dex in [ fe / h ] .",
    "however , there are some possible complications in this relative comparison .",
    "the slope of the [ li]-[fe / h ] relationship depends upon the assumed model atmospheres . furthermore , the derived value of the slope depends on the data analysis method which is used and is different for different subsets of the data ( @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , the [ li]-t@xmath0 slope reported by ryan ( 1996 ) is resistant to these effects .    within the framework of the rotational mixing hypothesis",
    ", one would also expect stochastic variations in the disk lifetimes and therefore an additional random component in the lithium abundances .",
    "since about 20% of the pleiades stars have modest to rapid rotation , the sample could ( for example ) happen to have slighty more rapid rotators at low [ fe / h ] and slightly fewer at relatively high [ fe / h ] by chance ; this effect is not included in the ryan ( 1996 ) or thorburn ( 1994 ) analysis .",
    "another possibility is that the trends in the models and the data are correct , and that galactic production of li is responsible for the difference between the trends . in all of the models we require some lithium production during the lifetime of the galaxy ; this would imply that the more metal - rich stars begin with slightly more lithium , which would counteract the [ li]-t@xmath0 trend predicted by the models . the galactic evolution of lithium remains a mystery , but we can estimate the effect as follows .",
    "if we scale the solar system lithium abundance ( [ li]=3.3 ) linearly with metallicity the newly produced lithium will contribute @xmath30[li ]  =  0.0 , 1.0 , 2.0 at @xmath25=-3.3 , -2.3 , -1.3 $ ] respectively . note that if the post - bbn lithium production scales faster than linearly with metallicity such halo contamination will be negligible .",
    "we infer a primordial abundance in the range [ li]@xmath31 .",
    "the total abundance at the low end of the range ( primordial plus production ) would therefore be 2.35 , 2.37 , and 2.51 at @xmath25=-3.3 , -2.3 , -1.3 $ ] respectively ; by comparison , at the high end of the range the comparable abundances would be 2.75 , 2.76 , and 2.82 .",
    "this suggests that galactic production could influence the li-[fe / h ] slope at higher metal abundances but not for abundances below @xmath28 .",
    "as we will show below , the detection of li in hd 84937 requires some li and li production at early epochs ; this production could have been highly variable and possibly even largely absent for the most metal poor stars .",
    "we therefore can not exclude an additional production component between the very metal - poor stars and the more typical plateau stars , but caution that there may not be a reliable relationship between production and metal abundance in this case .",
    "if the level of li seen in hd 84937 is typical for stars at [ fe / h]=@xmath28 , and the production of li by @xmath32 fusion is comparable to that of li , then we can set an upper limit on the variation in the initial li abundance between the most metal poor stars and the typical plateau stars by computing the li yield required to produce the observed li in hd 84937 .",
    "the li yield required to explain the observed li in hd 84937 is in the range of 3 @xmath33 to 7 @xmath33 .",
    "this suggest that variable production of li could have a modest impact on the [ li]-[fe / h ] slope even at early epochs .    in light of the uncertainties discussed above",
    "we have adopted an empirical approach .",
    "the value of the [ li]-[fe / h ] slope which minimizes the dispersion in the data set is computed , and the observed lithium abundances are then corrected for the effects of metallicity .",
    "we have therefore used the @xmath25=-2.3 $ ] models for our theoretical calculations and corrected the thorburn ( 1994 ) abundances to a uniform [ fe / h ] at this level using the relationship of thorburn ( 1994 ) ,    @xmath34_{\\rm detrended } = [ li]_{\\rm observed } + 0.13([fe / h]+2.3).\\ ] ]    this raw data is compared with the data corrected to a uniform abundance of @xmath28 in figure 5 .",
    "we note that another approach would be to draw the distribution of theoretical depletion factors from the distribution of [ fe / h ] in the thorburn sample , , to monte carlo both the initial conditions and the [ fe / h ] abundances . in numerical tests",
    "the correction in equation ( 4 ) reduces the dispersion in the data set by an amount comparable to the level introduced by the observed distribution of metal abundances convolved with the theoretical models .",
    "the final ingredient is age ; as shown in the bottom panel of figure 4 even significant variations in age produce only small changes in the lithium abundance at fixed t@xmath0 .",
    "this results from a combination of a low rate of lithium depletion at old ages and the evolutionary changes in t@xmath0 as a function of time , which move models along the plateau .",
    "we therefore neglect the impact of age variations on the dispersion and depletion patterns .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the lithium abundances of halo stars are compared with the thorburn ( 1994 ) dataset detrended to a uniform [ fe / h ] of @xmath28 in figure 6 .",
    "the different models all show a [ li]-t@xmath0 trend similar to the data .",
    "previous models with rotational mixing had a downward curvature at the hot end of the plateau , which is highly suppressed in these models , although there is a slight downward curvature in the s1 case .",
    "this difference can be attributed to improvements in the angular momentum loss law .",
    "the open cluster rotation data requires stronger angular momentum loss for higher mass stars ; this acts to preferrentially suppress lithium depletion in the higher mass models at the hot end of the plateau relative to models for cooler lower mass stars .",
    "the pleiades distribution of initial conditions also produces a mean trend with small internal scatter and a smaller population of overdepleted stars . as the solar disk lifetime",
    "is increased the dispersion and overall depletion both increase ; we can therefore use the dispersion in the halo plateau to set constraints on the overall depletion .",
    "the simulations in this section do not include observational errors , whose impact on dispersion estimates will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the thorburn sample also contains a small population of highly overdepleted stars ; their existence is a problem for standard stellar models and they are usually ignored in discussions of the dispersion in the halo plateau .",
    "we will not ignore the outliers ; in fact , such objects are a natural consequence of the models with rotational mixing combined with the observed distribution of rotation rates in young clusters .",
    "the maximum depletion level for the rapid rotators also increases as the absolute depletion increases .",
    "the existence of highly overdepleted stars can therefore be used to constrain the minimum level of absolute depletion in the halo plateau ; if the absolute depletion in the halo plateau is too small then stars far below the plateau should not be present , but they are .",
    "both the trends in the [ li]-t@xmath0 plane and the dispersion in the plateau have been used to argue against significant lithium depletion in halo stars .",
    "the simulations in figure 6 indicate that the current class of models are compatible with both , but the agreement between the data and the models worsens if the absolute depletion is too high .",
    "similar trends are present in the open cluster simulations . _ in other words , the open cluster and halo star data are consistent with being drawn from a zams angular momenta distribution similar to that required to explain the distribution of rotation rates in young open clusters .",
    "furthermore , both are best explained by a solar calibration in which the sun had an accretion disk lifetime shorter than the typical value for low mass stars . _    in the next section we quantify the constraints placed on the overall lithium depletion by the dispersion and the highly overdepleted stars .",
    "we also discuss the relative lithium-6 and lithium-7 depletion factors and constraints on the overall destruction of lithium-7 from the detection of lithium-6 in hd 84937 .",
    "lithium abundances versus effective temperatures for warm ( @xmath35k ) , metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath36 ) stars ( as observed by @xcite ) were shown in figure 5 .",
    "four independent groups have observed plateau stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the differences in the lithium abundances derived by different observers from halo stars can be traced to the choice of temperature scale and of model atmosphere required to extract an abundance from an observed absorption line .",
    "a survey of the literature shows that there may be a systematic uncertainty in the lithium abundance scale of order @xmath37 dex due to the choice of atmosphere model and of the stellar temperature scale .",
    "the intrinsic star - to - star dispersion is likely to be much smaller than this .",
    "there may also be correlations in the data in the sense that the lithium abundance increases slightly with effective temperature and with metallicity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or not ( @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt [ li]@xmath38 as the weighted mean plus estimated _ systematic _ error of all the plateau data .",
    "the raw dispersion about the trend is 0.16 dex ( thorburn 1994 ) . when the t@xmath0 and [ fe / h ] trends are removed , thorburn estimated the dispersion as 0.13 dex ; by comparison , her estimate of the observational error is 0.09 dex .",
    "estimates of the intrinsic star - to - star dispersion are therefore roughly half the raw dispersion ( 0.08 dex ( @xcite ) , 0.06 dex ( thorburn 1994 ) , @xmath39 dex ( @xcite ) ) .    in our rotationally mixed models ,",
    "the `` anomalous sun '' case corresponds to lithium depletion of 0.2 dex and a dispersion in depletion of 0.09 dex , consistent with estimates of the intrinsic dispersion .",
    "the intermediate disk case corresponds to lithium depletion of 0.4 dex and a dispersion in depletion of 0.16 dex which is at the limit of the raw dispersion .",
    "the `` typical sun '' case corresponds to lithium depletion of 0.69 dex and a dispersion of 0.25 dex which is considerably larger than the raw dispersion .",
    "this initial comparison suggests that an upper - bound to lithium depletion in halo stars is 0.4 dex . if the sun is anomalous ( as favored by the open cluster data )",
    "then little dispersion in the plateau is predicted , consistent with the data , along with a smaller overall depletion of 0.2 dex .",
    "so , two indicators , the open cluster data along with the lack of significant dispersion in the halo lithium abundances , both point to halo star lithium depletion in the range 0.2 - 0.4 dex .",
    "however , the calculation of the observational dispersion excludes 6 upper limits , and the distribution of theoretical depletion factors is significantly non - gaussian .",
    "we can use these additional characteristics of the plateau data to constrain the absolute depletion .",
    "standard models would require that the only dispersion in halo star lithium abundances is due to age , metal abundance , and observational error .",
    "age is a small effect in all classes of models , and the effects of metal abundance can be included by detrending the data .",
    "we would therefore expect the shape of the distribution to be determined by the observational errors and thus it should be gaussian .",
    "by contrast , the distribution of lithium depletion factors in rotational models is skewed .",
    "the majority of young cluster stars are slow rotators , so the majority of the depletion factors are tightly clustered with a very small intrinsic dispersion ; there is a component of stars with moderate rotation rates which produce a population with larger depletion factors and a small fraction ( 2 - 3% ) of rapid rotators with large depletion factors .",
    "in addition , the distribution will be smeared out by observational errors .",
    "we ran 1000 monte carlo simulations at intervals of 50k across the plateau and drew theoretical lithium depletion factors from the pleiades distribution of initial conditions . in one",
    "set of runs observational errors were neglected ; in a second set of runs we added a random error of 0.09 dex .",
    "the lithium depletion factors for each t@xmath0 were then sorted . in figure 7",
    "we compare the detrended thorburn data ( bottom panel ) with the 2.5% , median , and 97.5% bounds of the theoretical depletion factors for our s0 case ( top ) , s0.3 case ( second panel ) and s1 case ( third panel ) .",
    "the zero point was set by requiring that half the stars in the sample for all three cases were above the median and half the stars were below it .",
    "figure 8 presents the same cases for simulations which include observational errors .",
    "the top and bottom dashed lines can be regarded as effective @xmath40 bounds . _",
    "note that the observed lithium abundances have a similar morphology to the simulations ; in particular , they are not gaussian distributed about the mean as would be expected if these stars had suffered no lithium depletion . _ furthermore , the intrinsic dispersion for the majority of stars is significantly less than the observational errors ; in other words , the dispersion for the majority of stars is dominated by observational errors .",
    "the theoretical models predict that there should be a small number of highly overdepleted stars , which are indeed observed .",
    "this can be further quantified by comparing the distribution of abundances about the median for the simulations to the observed distribution of abundances about the median .",
    "we chose a reference temperature of 6000k and an [ fe / h ] of @xmath28 for the simulations and used the thorburn ( 1994 ) mean trend to correct the data to a uniform t@xmath0 and [ fe / h ] .",
    "histogram plots of the number of stars as a function of lithium abundance are compared to the number of stars as a function of lithium depletion factor expected in the simulations without and with observational errors in figures 9 and 10 respectively .",
    "the s0 case is a good match to the width of the distribution , while the s0.3 case is in marginal agreement and the s1 case clearly has a dispersion too large to be compatible with the data . for comparison purposes , an analogous distribution of depletion factors for solar abundance models at a temperature of 6000k",
    "is also shown .",
    "the dispersion in the bulk of the halo population is therefore consistent with overall depletions in the range of 0.2 - 0.4 dex , with lower depletion factors being favored .",
    "however , the existence of highly overdepleted stars can also be used to set bounds on the absolute depletion , and this favors higher absolute depletion factors in the above range . for the s0 case ,",
    "the median depletion is 0.2 dex and the maximum is 0.6 dex ; stars more than 0.4 dex below the plateau should therefore not be seen , in contradiction with the data .",
    "the corresponding bounds for the s0.3 case are 0.4 and 1.2 dex , permitting stars as much as 0.8 dex below the plateau ; this is in better agreement with the data .",
    "we also note that the observed fraction of such stars ( 4 out of 90 ) is similar to the fraction of very rapid rotators in young open clusters .",
    "we therefore conclude that the distribution of lithium abundances in the plateau is consistent with a range of 0.2 - 0.4 dex absolute depletion , with the bulk dispersion favoring lower values and the overdepleted stars favoring higher values within this range .      in figure 11",
    "we show the relationship between li destruction and li destruction in the rotationally mixed models chosen to correspond to the hot halo subgiant hd 84937 ( [ fe / h]@xmath41 and li / li @xmath42 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite,@xcite ) , to date the only star in which the detection of li has been confirmed by more than one group ( see hobbs & thorburn ( 1997 ) for a detailed observational summary of the li data ) .",
    "note that , depending on the solar normalization , the ratio of li destruction to li destruction can vary from a few ( for the s0 case ) to 10 ( for the s1 case ) .",
    "the absolute li depletion factor varies between roughly 6 and 70 , respectively .",
    "note that this is not the usual folklore of lithium depletion which anticipates substantial li destruction in any star where even minimal li destruction has occurred ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "indeed , it has often been argued that because li has been observed in at least one halo star , there can be little , if any , li depletion in any plateau stars ( @xcite ) . however , this argument was based on standard models without rotational mixing where all the lithium destruction is by convective burning during the star s approach to the main sequence .",
    "then , since li is much more fragile than li , any star in which li is not significantly destroyed is not expected to destroy any li at all . this li - li connection is relaxed in models which include rotational mixing . in the convective burning only models ,",
    "all the material on the surface has been exposed to the same temperature whereas in models with rotational mixing different fractions of the surface material are exposed to different temperatures . although the rank ordering ( with binding energy ) of the magnitude of lithium destruction is preserved ( , li is always destroyed more than li ) , the relative amounts of depletion can vary since the surface of the star is a mixture of gas which has been exposed to _ different _ temperatures .",
    "note also that rotational models predict a dispersion of li depletion at fixed t@xmath0 corresponding to different initial rotational velocities as drawn from a distribution of initial conditions .",
    "below we use the li observations to further constrain models of rotational mixing and overall lithium depletion .    to use the observed abundance of li as a constraint on the amount of lithium depletion , we require an estimate of its initial abundance .",
    "li is only produced in interesting ( , observable ) amounts by cosmic ray nucleosynthesis via two channels : ( 1 ) cosmic ray proton and alpha spallation of cno nuclei in the ambient ism ( and _ vice - versa _ ) and , ( 2 ) alpha - alpha fusion reactions . to avoid introducing more adjustable parameters than can be constrained by the observational data we can tie the cno contribution of li to the observed abundances of b and be which are produced by the same spallation process",
    "the be and b abundances in halo stars are observed to increase linearly with fe / h ( @xcite ) and , therefore , so too should the `` cno - tagged '' li . the predicted ratio of spallation - produced li to be or b depends on the specific cosmic ray spectrum and relative target / projectile abundances adopted . some of these details can be avoided if we simply normalize li production to the solar abundance of li ( [ li]@xmath43 ) : [ li]@xmath44 [ li]@xmath45 + [ fe / h ] = 2.2 + [ fe / h ] .",
    "this represents an upper limit to the cno cr production of li at any epoch .",
    "since the metallicity of the spite plateau stars is [ fe / h ] @xmath36 , the cno contribution will , in general , be quite small : [ li]@xmath46 .",
    "if this were the only production mechanism for li in halo stars , it would , along with the plateau value of [ li ] @xmath47 2.2 , correspond to a ratio li / li @xmath48 , which is comparable to that observed . in this case (",
    "production via spallation of cno ) there would be room for little , if any , li destruction .    to quantify this point ,",
    "consider the case of hd 84937 , a hot ( @xmath49k ) metal - poor star in which li observations have been claimed by two independent groups ( @xcite ; @xcite , 1997 ) .",
    "they find [ fe / h ] @xmath50 and [ li]@xmath51 , an order of magnitude _ more _ li than the maximum predicted from cno spallation alone : [ li]@xmath52 .",
    "it must be emphasized that this can not be used as evidence for the absence of li destruction in halo stars but instead points to the necessity of an additional source for the observed li ( in particular , one which does not scale with metallicity )",
    ".    alpha - alpha fusion synthesis of li ( @xcite ; sw ) , is not necessarily coupled to the cosmic ray spallation production of be and b and could , in principle , be such a source of li ( and a comparable amount of li ) .",
    "naively we expect the fusion contribution to scale as one lower power of fe / h than does the cno - spallation contribution ( , that it may be nearly independent of metallicity ) . as before for spallation ,",
    "the normalization of the alpha - alpha li contribution is essentially arbitrary . as an extreme upper limit to the abundance of alpha - alpha produced li in the gas out of which the stars form",
    ", we may adopt the solar abundance :    @xmath53_{cr(\\alpha\\alpha ) } \\le 2.2.\\ ] ]    this bound is certainly robust ( and most likely overly conservative ) since it assumes that cr fusion in the very early galaxy generated li at the solar abundance .",
    "nevertheless , it represents the maximum amount of li any pop ii star could contain . defining the li depletion factor , @xmath54 , as :",
    "( li / h)@xmath55 ( li / h)@xmath56 , we have for hd 84937    @xmath57    that is , there is a model indenpendent upper bound to li destruction of a factor of 14 - 25 for hd 84937 .",
    "the rotational models for hd 84937 which violate this constraint ( , destroy too much li ) are the same ones which generate too much dispersion in the plateau abundance of li and do not correctly predict the behavior of the lithium abundances in open clusters .",
    "this @xmath54 constraint allows us to obtain an independent upper bound on the depletion of li in plateau stars ( see figure 11 ) of @xmath58 dex .",
    "we comment here that although lemoine ( 1997 ) claim to have constrained @xmath54 to be strictly less than four , they did not include the fusion production of li via alpha - alpha which we have seen may be required if li has been detected in hd 84937 .",
    "since post - bbn production of lithium can compete with surface depletion , lithium production and destruction are coupled .",
    "thus the dispersion in the lithium data itself can be used to bound any contributions to the observed lithium abundance from post - big bang production and/or stellar destruction .",
    "every star should start with the same amount of bbn - produced li and variations in post - bbn production and stellar destruction will contribute to dispersion in the observed  plateau \" abundances .",
    "any observational limits to the dispersion provide a limit to the combination of cr - production and stellar depletion of lithium in the halo stars .",
    "that is , for any halo star , the observed total ( li _ plus _ li ) lithium abundance can be expressed as @xmath59 where the various @xmath60 s represent the observed ( obs ) , bbn , and cosmic ray produced ( cr ) number fractions of li relative to hydrogen .",
    "the cr contribution to the observed lithium , with account taken of stellar depletion , may be bounded by the dispersion in the observed lithium abundances : @xmath61 where we have assumed that the bbn contribution is fixed by the minimum of the plateau : @xmath62 to bound @xmath63 we may then write for the ( inverse of the ) li fraction @xmath64 + 1.\\ ] ] these relations can be used along with the observational data to bound the combinations @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the 6-to-7 ratio expected ( sw ) from cr nucleosynthesis is @xmath67 , leading to a bound on @xmath54/@xmath26 : @xmath68 that is , the small dispersion of the lithium data along with the li abundance limits the _ relative _ 6-to-7 depletion .",
    "we caution that this calculation relies on the measured li in only one star , hd 84937 .",
    "we find that the same models with rotation which , earlier , failed to reproduce the open cluster lithium abundance patterns , that predicted too much dispersion in the lithium plateau , and too much absolute destruction of li , also violate this constraint on the relative depletions of li and li . from all these  independent  constraints a consistent picture of non - zero but limited lithium depletion in the warm , metal - poor plateau stars emerges .    in conclusion , we find that those models with rotational mixing which are constrained to fit the lithium abundance patterns in open clusters require that the sun be an anomalously fast early rotator which has overdepleted lithium relative to most stars of its mass and age . extending these same models to halo stars yields depletion patterns which can be constrained by the lithium abundances observed in these stars .",
    "the predicted dispersion in lithium abundances and the predicted li depletion factors are consistent with the data for the _ same _ solar normalization required by the open cluster data .",
    "thus , models which satisfy all of the above criteria suggest that halo stars _ must _ deplete their initial lithium by at least 0.2 dex , but by no more than 0.4 dex .",
    "the conclusion that halo stars must deplete lithium in this range relies only on the assumption that halo stars have the same distribution of initial rotational velocities as do the open cluster stars .",
    "if halo stars do not rotate then standard models would predict no lithium depletion except at low t@xmath0 , contrary to the data . alternatively , significantly more lithium might be destroyed without increasing the dispersion in the observed lithium abundances if every halo star had nearly identical angular momentum histories .",
    "armed with our estimate of the lithium depletion factor relevant for the spite plateau halo stars we may use the data to bound the primordial abundance of lithium .",

    "this results in a triangular likelihood distribution for [ li]@xmath74 which has a 95% c.l .",
    "range for the log of the primordial lithium abundance only 5% smaller than the full range values we quote here . since the shape of the distributions we assume are , at best , an approximation , we quote the full range in [ li]@xmath75 resulting from the convolution of the two distributions .",
    "the predictions of standard bbn are uniquely determined by one parameter , the density of baryons , parameterized by @xmath76 - the baryon - to - photon ratio : @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is the ratio of the baryon density to the critical density and the hubble parameter is h@xmath79 = 100h km / s / mpc ; @xmath80 ) . for standard bbn the early universe",

    "the primordial abundances predicted by standard bbn are shown as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "the width of each curve reflects the @xmath40 uncertainty in the predictions .    our analysis of lithium depletion by rotational mixing , when combined with the lithium data leads to a primordial lithium abundance in the range : @xmath86 .",
    "comparing with the predictions of standard bbn ( see figure 12 ) , lithium identifies two possible ranges for @xmath76 .",
    "low-@xmath76 \" branch : @xmath87 1.7 and a ",
    "high-@xmath76 \" branch : 3.7 @xmath88 9.0 .",
    "once @xmath76 is identified the primordial abundances of deuterium and helium-4 ( also , helium-3 ) follow from the predictions of standard bbn .",
    "the baryon density corresponding to the low-@xmath76 range is quite small : @xmath89 0.006 .",
    "if the x - ray emission from rich clusters of galaxies provides a  fair \" sample of the universal fraction of baryons ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) this argues strongly for a very low density , open universe : @xmath90 .",
    "such a low baryon density may also be in conflict with the baryon density required to reproduce the lyman@xmath91 forest data in large - scale structure simulations ( weinberg 1997 ) .",
    "this low-@xmath76 range predicts a high primordial deuterium abundance ( @xmath92 17 ) which is inconsistent with the low deuterium abundance inferred for some high - redshift , low metallicity qso absorption systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) but not with the high abundances inferred for some other systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this low-@xmath76 range corresponds to a bbn - predicted helium abundance ( y@xmath93 0.235 ) which is in excellent agreement with that inferred from emission - line observations of the low - metallicity , extragalactic regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .      avoiding the minimum in the bbn lithium `` valley ''",
    "( see figure 12 ) , this alternate branch favors a higher baryon density : 0.014 @xmath94 0.033 which , when combined with the x - ray cluster baryon fraction estimate , permits a higher total density universe : @xmath95 .",
    "a baryon density in this range is consistent with the lyman@xmath91 forest data ( weinberg 1997 ) . on this branch",
    "the primordial deuterium abundance is predicted to be smaller ( 6.6 @xmath96 1.1 ) , consistent with some recent estimates from high - z qso absorbers .",
    "however , the primordial helium abundance does pose a challenge to standard bbn since 0.243 @xmath97 y@xmath93 0.253 is predicted while the region data suggest 0.230 @xmath97 y@xmath93 0.238 ( but see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite who derive @xmath98 from an independent data set ) .",
    "the lithium abundances of stars have interesting implications for cosmology and for the theory of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "the conclusions of this paper impact both of these areas .",
    "standard stellar models implicitly assume that a variety of physical processes known to occur in real stars can be neglected ; for many purposes this is a good approximation .",
    "there is now extensive evidence in stars that the predictions of standard models are not in agreement with all the data .",
    "furthermore , work from a variety of investigators on physical effects not included in the standard models has concluded that there are physically well - motivated processes which can affect the surface lithium abundances of stars .",
    "standard models and the previous generation of nonstandard models predicted initial li abundances that differ by up to a factor of ten from the same set of current data , with very different implications for cosmology .    we believe that mild envelope mixing driven by rotation is the most promising candidate for explaining the _ complete _ observational picture .",
    "an improved treatment of angular momentum evolution in low mass stars now allows us to generate stellar models with rotation which are consistent with the rotation rates observed as a function of mass and age .",
    "we have inferred the distribution of initial angular momenta in young clusters and computed the distribution of lithium depletion factors as a function of mass , composition , and age .",
    "the resulting lithium depletion pattern is in good agreement with both and data , and the distribution of theoretical depletion factors is consistent with the distribution of abundances . for stars in particular , the observed slope of the [ li]-t@xmath0 relationship , the observed dispersion in abundance at fixed t@xmath0 , the existence of a small population of overdepleted stars , and the simultaneous detection of li and li in one halo star are all consistent with the predictions of the theoretical models .",
    "the primary uncertainty in the absolute depletion of li is the initial angular momentum of the sun , which is used to calibrate the mixing diffusion coefficients .",
    "we have used the observed properties mentioned above to set bounds on li depletion for stars . those models which fit the data best",
    "predict a small but real depletion of lithium in the warm ( t@xmath99k ) , metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath36 ) stars : 0.2 @xmath97 logd@xmath100 0.4 .",
    "these same models are consistent with the very small observed dispersion in abundances about the plateau value and with the survival of some li .",
    "these depletion factors are significantly less than in previous models with rotational mixing ( pdd , chaboyer & demarque 1994 ) , and this difference can be directly attributed to the adoption of an improved treatment of angular momentum evolution .",
    "the uncertainties in the li depletion factor can be reduced by a combination of new data and improved stellar evolution models .",
    "a large set of accurate lithium abundances in old open clusters would enable us to calibrate the diffusion coefficients for mixing without relying on the solar calibration .",
    "microscopic diffusion and rotational mixing should be considered together , although the work of chaboyer & demarque ( 1994 ) indicated that the predictions of such models are similar to those which include rotation alone .",
    "the observed li depletion pattern is relatively insensitive to the treatment of internal angular momentum transport , with a factor of ten in the time scale corresponding to less than a 10% change in the logarithmic lithium depletion factor in the work of pdd .",
    "however , the solar rotation curve does provide evidence for angular momentum transport from mechanisms not considered in the current paper , such as magnetic fields and/or internal gravity waves .",
    "lithium depletion in models which include these effects and hydrodynamic mechanisms should be explored .",
    "intermediate metallicity stars could also provide a valuable test of the dependence of lithium depletion on metal abundance .    when our constraints on lithium - depletion are combined with the abundances inferred from observations of the spite plateau halo stars ( [ li]@xmath101 0.10 ) we find for the range in the abundance of primordial lithium : 2.35 @xmath97 [ li]@xmath93 2.75 ( 2.2 @xmath102(li / h)@xmath93 5.6 ) .",
    "although lithium is not the ideal baryometer , a comparison with the predictions of standard bbn identifies two options : low-@xmath76 and high-@xmath76 .",
    "the low-@xmath76 branch suggests a very low baryon density , open universe which may be in conflict with the baryon density inferred from observations of the lyman - alpha forest .",
    "although the helium abundance predicted for this low-@xmath76 option agrees with that inferred from region data , the very high predicted deuterium abundance may not be consistent with observations .",
    "in contrast , the high-@xmath76 branch corresponds to a baryon density consistent with the ly-@xmath10 data and permits a higher density universe . in this case",
    "the predicted primordial deuterium abundance is in excellent agreement with the low deuterium qso data but a considerably higher primordial helium abundance is predicted than is inferred from some of the observational data .",
