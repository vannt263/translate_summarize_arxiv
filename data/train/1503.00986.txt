    "casimir and van der waals ( vdw ) forces are interactions between neutral macroscopic bodies or atoms arising from the quantum fluctuations of both the electromagnetic field and the atomic charges @xcite .",
    "they are responsible for many characteristic phenomena in physics , chemistry and biology : the deviation from ideal - gas behaviour in non - polar gases @xcite , latent heat of liquids , capillary attraction , physical absorption , and cell adhesion @xcite .",
    "dispersion interactions have even played an important role during the early stages of planet formation @xcite , and they are also supposed to have a fundamental role in selective long - distance biomolecular recognition @xcite . due to their strong distance - dependence ,",
    "they become more and more important on the ever - decreasing scales of nanotechnology , where they lead to the unwanted stiction of small mobile components @xcite . in a series of ground - breaking experiments ,",
    "the vdw force between an excited barium ion and a mirror have been measured to high precision @xcite .",
    "such experiments show an oscillating dependence of the vdw force on the ion .",
    "we will focus on the vdw force between two atoms , in excited states @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the interaction in this case is different from the interaction between two ground - state atoms due to the possible exchange of a real photon between the atoms . in the well - understood non - retarded regime , that is , for distances @xmath2 much smaller than the wavelength of atomic electronic transitions , one finds @xcite @xmath3 where , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the matrix - elements of the dipole operator and @xmath6 the energy relative to the state @xmath7 . for downward transitions , @xmath8 can be negative and the resulting energy positive , yielding a repulsive interaction . hence non - equilibrium situations can provide repulsive vdw interactions .",
    "the interaction at larger separations has been object of controversies . in a first group of works , it was predicted that the magnitude of the retarded potential oscillates as a function of interatomic distance @xcite . in a later group of publications it was claimed that the retarded potential is non - oscillatory and proportional to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the conflicting results are due to subtle differences in treating divergent energy denominators in the photon propagators : the poles in the real axis can be avoided using the principal value prescription or adding infinitesimal factors in the energy denominators and this leads to different results .",
    "both procedures are mathematically correct , but they yield different physical results : a spatially oscillatory behaviour of the interaction in the first case and a monotonically decreasing behaviour in the second .    a group of recent works have used dynamical approaches to address the problem . by an appropriate time - averaging procedure @xcite or in the limit of vanishing atomic line widths @xcite , a third result , for the vdw interaction on the excited atom , was found that oscillates in magnitude and sign .",
    "note that an earlier approach based on time - dependent perturbation theory yields a non - oscillatory result for the force on the ground - state atom that is however valid only for times shorter than the lifetime of the excited state @xcite .",
    "similar considerations about timescales hold for the diagrammatic non - equilibrium description used in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a very recent work claims that both results , the monotonic and the oscillating , are valid , but they describe different physical processes @xcite : the oscillating result is related to a coherent exchange of excitation between the atoms , while the monotonic result is associated to a fast loss of excitation acquired from the initially excited atom . another recent",
    "work finds that both forces can simultaneously arise in a single set - up : the vdw interaction on the excited atom oscillates , in agreement with @xcite , but the vdw force acting on the ground - state atom is monotonic @xcite .",
    "this result would imply an apparent violation of the action ",
    "reaction principle in excited systems in free space .",
    "however , it was shown that the momentum balance is restored when taking the photon emitted by the excited atom into account @xcite .",
    "this emission being asymmetric due to the presence of the ground - state atom , the emitted photon carries some average momentum , so that the difference between forces on the excited vs ground - state atoms can be interpreted as a photon recoil force .",
    "the situation is somewhat similar to the lateral casimir ",
    "polder force on an atom near a nanofibre , which is also associated with asymmetric emission @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the van der waals interaction involving excited atoms by means of a dynamical approach on the basis of the markov approximation .",
    "we show that the damped internal atomic dynamics uniquely determines the oscillatory or monotonic behavior of the retarded interaction for excited atoms . in our dynamical model , the poles in the real axis",
    "are automatically shifted to the upper or lower part of the complex plane , and no ad hoc choice for the imaginary shifts in the denominators is required .",
    "we will show that , when one atom is excited , the vdw force acting on the ground - state atom is monotonic and the vdw interaction of the excited atom is oscillating , in agreement with the most recent results in literature @xcite .",
    "our dynamical approach is an alternative to the time - dependent perturbation theory @xcite , where the behaviour of the force is determined via a time average over rapid oscillations on time scales of the order of atomic transition frequencies .",
    "instead , our model allows us to study the decay - induced dynamics on larger time scales of the order of the excited - state lifetimes .",
    "it reveals that the force is governed by population - induced dynamics on these scales , where for times much larger than the lifetime of the intial atomic state the vdw force converges to that between ground - state atoms .",
    "in addition , we are able to account for a general environment for the two atoms , via the classical green tensor .",

    "we consider the mutually coupled evolution of two atoms and the medium - assisted field .",

    "the dynamics of the atoms can be described with time - dependent flip operators , defined by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is an energy eigenstate , and similarly @xmath12 .    in order to evaluate the force between the two atoms we must first solve the atom - field dynamics to obtain the flip operators and the field operators in the heisenberg picture .",

    "when only one atom is excited , the force acting on the excited atom is oscillating ; on the other hand , the force acting on the ground - state atom is monotonic , coherently with the perturbative result in @xcite .",
    "this implies a violation of the action - reaction principle in excited systems in free space .",

    "the force acting on the ground - state atom is monotonic . at small distances",

    "however our theory is more general because it includes the presence of general environments for the two atoms , like magnetodielectric bodies .",
    "many differences arise in this more general case .",
    "firstly the interaction can be described as a two - photon process , where the photons can be reflected by the body s surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) ; this reflection is mathematically described in our formalism by the scattering green tensor , which is known for many geometries and magnetodielectric properties . secondly due to the presence of the additional body",
    "the action - reaction principle is also violated for ground - state atoms , with the interaction being accompanied by the transfer of linear momentum to the body .",
    "lastly the total force acting on one molecule is not parallel to the interparticle separation vector .",
    "we see that the resonant contribution vanishes for times much larger than the atomic lifetimes ( @xmath83 ) , when the atoms have decayed to the ground - state .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) represents this population - induced dynamics for the force acting on the excited rubidium at a given distance .",
    "we see that for time much larger than the atomic lifetime the force converges to the ground - state force , which is attractive . for times much smaller than the atomic lifetime",
    "the force is repulsive and roughly one order of magnitude larger than the ground - state force .    as stated above , the resonant force on the excited atom",
    "may be associated with photon recoil due to spontaneous emission .",
    "the fact that this force is stronger at small times can be understood from its ensemble - average nature : the probability of photon emission ( and hence recoil ) is highest for small times where a large fraction of the ensemble atoms are still in their excited state .",
    "let us compare our result with the experimentally observed single - atom casimir  polder force .",
    "if an initially excited atom @xmath26 is placed near a magnetodielectric body , the resonant contribution , associated with a possible emission of a real photon , reads @xcite : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the body s scattering green s tensor .",

    "the substitution of this expansion into the single - atom casimir ",
    "polder force leads to a resonant force @xmath91 on the excited atom which is simply the sum over the ( oscillating ) resonant forces  ( [ resonant ] ) on the excited atom due to the ground - state atoms constituting the body .",
    "note that a monotonous force contribution is absent from the single - atom casimir  polder force  ( [ cp ] ) , as the atoms in the body are not excited . in the present combination of an excited atom interacting with a ground - state atom",
    ", we would expect the force on the body to contain a monotonous casimir  polder force component .",
    "however , the force on the body is usually not considered in the context of casimir  polder physics due to the strongly asymmetric mass ratio .",
    "our dynamical theory has allowed us to study the vdw force involving excited atoms in generic environments .",
    "it is able to give a unique answer to the old puzzle whether the respective interaction is oscillating or monotonic , without recourse to ad hoc assumptions or prescriptions .",
    "when one atom is excited we have shown that the van der waals force acting on the excited atom indeed shows drexhage - type oscillations , while the force acting on the ground - state atom is monotonic .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated that the oscillating force is consistent with the respective casimir ",
    "polder force between an excited atom and a ground - state body . on the contrary",
    ", the monotonic forces components can not be deduced from the atom ",
    "body force in this way , because they act on the atoms inside the body whereas casimir  polder calculations are usually restricted to calculating the force on the single atom in front of the body .",
    "the oscillating force on the excited atom could have profound implications on the spatial correlations of excited atomic ensembles , in particular for rydberg systems .",
    "in addition , both the oscillating and monotonous force components are expected to arise in waveguides as recently studied in refs .",
