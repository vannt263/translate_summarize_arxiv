    "since the top quark was discovered at the fermilab tevatron in 1995@xcite , it has always been one of the hottest topics in particle physics .",
    "so far , the top quark is the heaviest particle discovered , with a mass close to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "thus it is a wonderful probe for the electroweak breaking mechanism and new physics ( np ) beyond the standard model ( sm ) . as a genuine top quark factory",
    ", the lhc will copiously produce the top quark events and can provide a good opportunity to scrutinize the top quark properties .    in order to solve the hierarchy problem ,",
    "the little higgs model was proposed @xcite , where the higgs boson is constructed as a pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "the littlest higgs model ( lh)@xcite provides an economical realization for this theory , however , this model suffers strong constraints from electroweak precision tests @xcite .",
    "a feasible way to relax this constraints is to introduce a discrete symmetry called t - parity@xcite in the lh model .",
    "this resulting model is referred to as the littlest higgs model with t - parity ( lht ) .",
    "the lht model predicts many new particles , such as heavy gauge bosons , mirror fermions and heavy top partners , they can interact with the top quark and contribute to the top pair production at the loop level .    at the lhc",
    ", top quarks can be mostly produced in @xmath4 production through strong interactions and up to now the @xmath4 production has been measured in different channels with remarkable accuracy@xcite . in general , qcd controls the theoretical predictions for the @xmath4 production in both the sm and np at hadron colliders , and the qcd high order corrections play a key role for the accurate theoretical predictions .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to perform the qcd high order calculations in order to test the sm and search for np . in our previous work",
    ", we have studied the one loop electroweak effects on the @xmath4 production process in the lht at the lhc@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the latest experimental constraints and calculate the one loop qcd corrections to the @xmath4 production process in the lht at the lhc . since the new interactions between top quark and lht particles can not only affect the @xmath4 production rate but also the spin polarization@xcite , we also discuss the lht corrections to the spin polarization in the @xmath4 production process .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we give a brief review of the lht model related to our work .",
    "in sec.iii we give a brief description for the one - loop qcd calculations in the lht model .",
    "in sec.iv we show the numerical results and some discussions .",
    "finally , we make a short summary in sec.v .",
    "the lht model is based on a @xmath5 non - linear @xmath6 model . at the scale @xmath7 , the global group @xmath8 is spontaneously broken into @xmath9 by a @xmath10 symmetric tensor and the gauged subgroup @xmath11^{2}$ ] of @xmath8",
    "is broken into the sm gauge group @xmath12 .",
    "after the symmetry breaking , four new heavy gauge bosons @xmath13 appear , whose masses up to @xmath14 are given by @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the sm @xmath18 and @xmath19 gauge couplings , respectively .    in order to preserve the t - parity , a copy of quarks and leptons with t - odd quantum number are added .",
    "we denote the mirror quarks by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are the generation index . in order to cancel the quadratic divergences to the higgs boson mass arising from the sm top quark ,",
    "an additional t - even top partner @xmath22 that has its associated t - odd mirror quark @xmath23 are introduced . the new fermions which can contribute to the one loop qcd correction of top quark pair production are @xmath24 , whose",
    "masses up to @xmath14 are given by @xmath25\\\\ & & m_{t^{-}}=\\frac{f}{v}\\frac{m_{t}}{\\sqrt{x_{l}}}[1+\\frac{v^{2}}{f^{2}}(\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{1}{2}x_{l}(1-x_{l}))]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 are the diagonalized yukawa couplings of the mirror quarks , @xmath27 is the mixing parameter between the sm top - quark @xmath28 and the new top - quark @xmath22 .",
    "at the tree - level , the feynman diagrams of the process @xmath29 are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the complete one - loop qcd corrections to the process @xmath30 can be generally divided into several parts : self - energies , vertex corrections , boxes and their relevant counter terms . if the amplitudes are performed at the order @xmath31 , we find that the new particles in the lht model only can contribute to the self - energies and the relevant counter terms , which means that there are only the lht qcd one - loop virtual corrections to the process @xmath30 .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams for the subprocesses @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the lht model are depicted in fig.2 .",
    "we can see that the lht qcd one - loop virtual corrections ( @xmath34 ) come from the fermion loops .",
    "the one - loop qcd corrected production cross section of the process @xmath35 can be obtained by @xmath36    in the t hooft - feynman gauge , we use the dimensional reduction method to regulate the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences in the fermion loops and adopt the on - shell renormalization scheme to remove them .",
    "we list the explicit expressions of these amplitudes in appendix .",
    "we have checked that the uv divergences in the renormalized propagator have been canceled . due to no massless particles in the loop , there are no infrared ( ir ) singularities in the one - loop integrals . in our numerical calculations , we use the parton distribution function cteq10@xcite with renormalization / factorization scale @xmath37 .",
    "the relevant lht parameters are the scale @xmath38 , the mixing parameter @xmath27 and the yukawa couplings @xmath39 . for the mirror fermion masses ,",
    "we get @xmath40 at @xmath41 and assume that the masses of the first two generations are degeneracy : @xmath42    recently , both of the cms and atlas collaborations reported their search results of the fermionic top partner and respectively excluded the masses regions below 557 gev @xciteand 656 gev@xcite at 95% cl . in our numerical calculations , we consider the constraints above and scan the parameter regions : @xmath43gev , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "and we require our samples to satisfy the constraints from refs.@xcite .",
    "we take the input parameters of the sm as@xcite @xmath46    we will discuss the lht qcd one - loop corrections to the ( un)polarized top pair production by using the following observables :    * for the unpolarized @xmath4 production , we calculate the relative corrections for total @xmath4 production cross section(@xmath47 ) , which is defined by : @xmath48 * for the polarized @xmath4 production , we calculate the spin correlation(@xmath49)@xcite , which is defined by : @xmath50 here , the subindices _",
    "l(r ) _ represent left- ( @xmath51 ) and right - handed(@xmath52 ) top(antitop ) quarks , respectively .",
    "in fig.3(a ) , we show the relative correction of the @xmath4 production cross section @xmath53 as the function of the scale @xmath38 at the lhc with @xmath0 tev respectively .",
    "we can see that the maximum value of the relative correction to the @xmath4 production cross section can reach @xmath54% for @xmath55 tev and @xmath56% for @xmath57 tev , respectively .",
    "the results indicate that the size of the corrections and the sensitivity on these effects are larger at 8 tev than at 14 tev .",
    "this is because the correction of the subprocess @xmath58 is positive and the correction of the subprocess @xmath59 is negative so that they cancel each other . due to",
    "the main correction comes from @xmath60 , the relative correction of the @xmath61 total cross section is negative .",
    "when the center - of - mass energy @xmath62 varies from 8 tev to 14 tev , the correction of the subprocess @xmath63 increases quickly so that the cancel between this two subprocesses become stronger .",
    "besides , when the scale @xmath38 increases , the relative corrections @xmath53 become small , which indicates that the lht qcd one - loop effects on @xmath4 production cross section will decouple at the high scale @xmath38 .    in fig.3(b ) , we show the relative correction of the @xmath4 production cross section @xmath53 as the function of the yukawa couplings @xmath64 at the lhc with @xmath0 tev respectively .",
    "we can see that the relative corrections @xmath65 decrease with the yukawa couplings @xmath64 increasing , which indicates that the lht qcd one - loop effects on @xmath4 production cross section also decouple at the heavy mirror quark masses .    in fig.3(c )",
    ", we show the relative correction of the @xmath4 production cross section @xmath53 as the function of the mixing parameter @xmath27 at the lhc with @xmath0 tev respectively .",
    "the distribution behaviors of the samples can be explained as follows . according to the eqs.(4 , 5 )",
    ", we can see that the heavy top quark @xmath22 and @xmath23 masses have a strong dependence on the mixing parameter @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath66 , the masses of @xmath22 and @xmath23 will become heavy and their contribution become very small .",
    "when @xmath67 , the masses of @xmath22 will become heavy while the masses of @xmath23 will become light . as a result , the effect of @xmath23 will still reside in the @xmath4 production .",
    "recently , the cms collaboration reported their measurement of the @xmath4 spin correlation coefficient @xmath68 in the helicity basis@xcite , which is agree with the sm predictions . in fig.4",
    ", we show the relative correction of the @xmath4 spin correlation @xmath49 as the function of @xmath69 for the lhc with @xmath0 tev , respectively .",
    "we can see that the behaviors of @xmath49 versus @xmath70 are similar to those of the relative correction @xmath53 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath49 can reach about @xmath2 for @xmath55 tev and @xmath3 for @xmath57 tev , which may be detected at the lhc@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we studied the one - loop @xmath31 qcd corrections to @xmath4 production in the lht model at the lhc for @xmath0 tev .",
    "we presented the numerical results for the relative correction to @xmath4 production cross section and @xmath4 spin correlation at the lhc .",
    "the relative correction of the @xmath4 production cross section is negative and only can reach @xmath1 .",
    "the relative correction of the @xmath4 spin correlation @xmath49 can reach about @xmath2 for @xmath55 tev and @xmath3 for @xmath57 tev , which may be a potential probe to detect the lht effects at the lhc .",
