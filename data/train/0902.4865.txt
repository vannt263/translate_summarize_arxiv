    "the recent indirect observational evidence of dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy in the universe @xcite has motivated the study of new cosmological and astrophysical scenarios that can encompass these observations . at a cosmological level",
    ", the quintessence scenario @xcite provides fittings to the present accelerated expansion rate of the universe and should be consistent with the other above  mentioned observations .",
    "typically , quintessence introduces new fields that have their origin in theories that attempt to unify all forces of nature ( strings , braneworlds ) .",
    "these unification schemes result in extensions to general relativity ( gr ) which determine a new dynamics .",
    "tensor theories ( stt ) of gravity are examples of effective theories that stem from such unifying schemes @xcite .",
    "as one may suspect , in addition to cosmological consequences , such theoretical extensions also predict local , astrophysical effects .",
    "traditionally , to understand the dynamics of a galaxy , a dm profile has been introduced @xcite or , alternatively , a modification to the newtonian gravitational law , e.g. via yukawa couplings @xcite , or even modifications to the newtonian motion law , such as mond @xcite . within the first approach ,",
    "several dm candidates have been proposed , including a scalar field ( sf ) as dm itself @xcite .",
    "the second approach has been used to obtain flat rotation curves in spirals via stt , without using dm halos .",
    "adjusting rotation curve profiles using stt implies that the strength of the yukawa coupling , @xmath1 , has to be negative , leading to a phantomlike nonminimally coupled field .",
    "moreover , the adjustment of different rotation curves of specific galaxies , points to different values for the range parameter of the theory , @xmath2 @xcite , implying a mass spectrum for the fundamental theory at hand .",
    "the third approach solves flat rotation curves dynamics in spirals , but fails to fully understand cluster dynamics .",
    "this latter approach will not be considered here .",
    "our model is a combination of the first two approaches mentioned above : we use both a dm halo and a sf nonminimally coupled to gr , as long as these two elements could simultaneously play a role in the galactic dynamics , and mitigate the constraints imposed on stt parameters , when using that theory alone .    following this line of thought ,",
    "we have recently studied @xcite the influence that stt have at galactic scales , see also @xcite .",
    "we considered the newtonian limit of stt and computed potential ",
    "density pairs of a spherical galaxy in which nfw s @xcite and dehnen s @xcite density profiles were used .",
    "we also computed some other relevant observational quantities ( rotation curves , dispersions ) , by which we accounted for the influence of the stt scalar fields in the galaxy .",
    "such influence is characterized by the two parameters ( @xmath3 ) of stt , see below . in this work",
    "we use this formalism to build a galactic model that is , by construction , consistent with the measured rotation curves of stars and with some luminosity profile . as a result",
    ", the form of the newtonian potential is exactly solved , and the sf and dm distribution in a galaxy are numerically computed , and their specific features depend on the fundamental parameters @xmath4 of the stt . for the values of the parameter space analyzed , the resulting dm has shallow profiles near the center .",
    "some other models such as the gravitational suppression hypothesis @xcite have been put forward , in which a yukawa term is added in the newtonian potential .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed the rotation curves best fit in this model , in which a nfw profile is used .",
    "they concluded that this hypothesis does not fit several rotational curves of spirals and , hence , does not solve the core / cuspy problem of dm in the center of galaxies .",
    "arguments in favor of a cusp like center can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , however recently more evidence has emerged favoring a corelike galactic center @xcite . in @xcite a way can be found to reconcile both approaches .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in the next section we give a brief description of the stt newtonian approximation , where the sf background value is set to have the usual gravitational constant value at small distances , @xmath5 . in sec .",
    "[ galactic - model ] , we build a galactic model by giving the rotation curves and baryon density profile , and in sec .",
    "[ spherical - sol ] we analyze the influence of the pair of parameters ( @xmath3 ) on the sf and dm density distributions .",
    "finally , in the last section we discuss the results and present our conclusions .",

    "in accordance with the newtonian approximation , gravity and sf are weak .",

    "we have set the cosmological constant equal to zero since within galactic scales its influence is negligible .",
    "this is because the average density in a galaxy is much larger than a cosmological constant that is compatible with observations .",
    "thus , we only consider the influence of luminous and dark matter .",
    "these matter components gravitate in accordance with the modified ",
    "newtonian theory determined by eqs .",

    "note that eq .",
    "( [ pares_eq_h00 ] ) can be cast as a poisson equation for @xmath25    @xmath26    thus , the new newtonian potential is now given by @xmath27    solutions to these equations , the so  called potential ",
    "density pairs @xcite , were found for the nfw s and dehnen s density profiles @xcite and for axisymmetric systems @xcite . for point particles",
    "the solution is well known , see for instance @xcite , and with the choice of the above  mentioned background field , one has : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the point particle mass producing the field .",
    "the strength of the new scalar force is given by @xmath1 and its action range by @xmath2 .",
    "for local scales , @xmath30 , deviations from the newtonian theory are exponentially suppressed , and for @xmath31 the newtonian constant diminishes ( augments ) to @xmath32 for positive ( negative ) @xmath1 .",
    "recently , the effect of stt has been investigated in different cosmological scenarios in which variations of the newtonian constant are constrained .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied the influence of varying @xmath33 on the doppler peaks of the cmbr , and concluded that their parameter ( @xmath34 ) should be in the interval @xmath35 in order to be within the error bars of the cmbr measurements . in our notation",
    "this translates into @xmath36 .",
    "however , this range for @xmath1 has to be taken as a rough estimation , since these authors have only considered a variation of @xmath33 , and not a full perturbation study within stt .",
    "the latter has been done by @xcite , who found some deviations from the newtonian dynamics , that when translated into our strength parameter would correspond to @xmath37 ; however , they do not compare their results with observations . on the other hand ,",
    "a structure formation analysis has been done by @xcite , in which deviations of the matter power spectrum are studied by adding a yukawa potential to the newtonian .",
    "they found some allowed dynamics , that turn out to constrain our parameter to be within @xmath38 ; but again a self - consistent perturbation study in general stt is missing .",
    "thus , the above three estimates can be taken as order - of - magnitude constraints for our models .",
    "for definitiveness , we will take values within the range @xmath39 .",
    "the value @xmath40 yields an asymptotic growing factor of @xmath41 in @xmath33 , whereas the value @xmath42 makes @xmath33 to asymptotically reduce by one - fourth .",
    "we proceed to build a galactic model by assuming that the total matter content consists of two components , baryons and cold dm , @xmath43 ; baryons represent stars , and the cold dm component could be of any type .",
    "the dynamics is determined by the theory explained in the preceding section .",
    "there are two possibilities on the dm origin : i ) dm is not related to the sf , and ii ) dm is associated with the boson produced by the sf . in the former case , dm can be for example an ensemble of neutralinos , whose mass is in the range @xmath44 @xcite , within an effective supergravity theory that nonminimally couples to gravity , see for example @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "ii ) , the mass of the dm particle is given by @xmath45 , with @xmath46 kpc , implying that @xmath47ev .",
    "the smallness of this mass would have to be explained by a particle physics theory , e.g. similar to light scalar presented by @xcite , yet nonminimally coupled to gravity . both baryons and dm ` feel ' the same gravitational potential , @xmath48 , but are differently distributed in the galaxy . for the baryon component",
    "we assume a freeman  disk density profile @xcite , that is , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mass of the disk and @xmath51 its radius . for the dm density we do not assume a particular profile . instead",

    "this profile is supposed to be valid for spirals of different types @xcite but a number of issues are still open @xcite .",

    "the dm solutions near the galactic center ( @xmath127 ) with @xmath1 positive are a bit shallower ( @xmath128 ) than those with @xmath1 negative ( @xmath129 ) , and both of them are much shallower than nfw s profiles @xcite .",
    "solutions at @xmath85 for @xmath1 positive decay as ( @xmath130 ) and for @xmath1 negative decay weaker ( @xmath131 ) . at @xmath132 for positive",
    "@xmath1 the dm profile behaves as @xmath133 and for negative @xmath1 the behavior is @xmath133 .",
    "the uncertainties stemming from the allowed values of the fitting parameters reported in table i. for the allowed values of @xmath61 , the dm exponents for @xmath127 vary between @xmath134 , for @xmath135 between @xmath136 , and for @xmath137 vary between @xmath138 .",
    "the slopes of the dm profiles change smoothly , so that their behavior does not qualitatively differ from their mean value .",
    "with respect to the variations of @xmath50 and @xmath62 the exponents vary less than ( or of the order of ) @xmath139 .",
    "on the other hand , for positive ( negative ) @xmath1 , @xmath75 is bigger ( smaller ) than @xmath76 always , since the effect of the sf is to diminish ( augment ) the effective gravitational constant for @xmath77 , being @xmath78 , thus it is necessary to compensate it with a corresponding larger ( smaller ) dm density .",
    "finally , asymptotically , for @xmath104 , the exterior solution is valid , and thus @xmath105 is similar to @xmath106 .",
    "we have found numerical solutions for the allowed parameter space for strength of the sf potential , @xmath69 , and within galactic distances , @xmath140 kpc .",
    "the results indicate some systematic tendencies : the effect of the sf is more apparent for @xmath141 , and its influence attenuates for @xmath142 , since in this regime the behavior is essentially newtonian ( @xmath143 ) for @xmath144 . for small",
    "@xmath124 the dm profile tends to the standard newtonian one ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "the intention of the present work was to study the influence of a massive sf in a galaxy model that is compatible with a typical baryon distribution and follows the urc of observed galaxies .",
    "this construction fixes the newtonian potential , and for the stt parameters analyzed , the resulting dm profile is shallow at the center of the halo .",
    "these results are encouraging showing the important role that both contributions , dm and stt , could have in the dynamics of the systems .",
    "we think that numerical n - body simulations using the stt of gravity have to be done to confirm the solutions discussed here .",
