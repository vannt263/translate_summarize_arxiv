    "next , let us proceed to a discussion of the most interesting results for the low - temperature thermodynamics of the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg octahedral chain , which were obtained within the framework of the localized - magnon approach elaborated in sect .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall , however , that the localized - magnon theory provides reasonable results only in the highly - frustrated parameter region @xmath126 , where the many - magnon states constructed from the lowest - energy one - magnon ( [ om1 ] ) and two - magnon ( [ st ] ) localized states are the most relevant ones for a proper description of the low - temperature thermodynamics .    for the sake of comparison and verification , the magnetization and specific heat of the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg octahedral chain obtained from the localized - magnon approach",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] along with the analogous data for the finite - size chain of @xmath140 spins obtained within the full ed method .",
    "let us first emphasize two interesting features , namely ( i ) the extra low - temperature peak in the specific heat for magnetic fields slightly below the saturation field , cf .",
    "[ fig8](d ) , and , ( ii ) the noticeable increase of the magnetization with growing temperature for @xmath141 and @xmath142 , cf . fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) .",
    "both unconventional features are related to the flat bands in the one - magnon excitations , cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "it can be understood from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] that the localized - magnon theory provides a plausible description of the low - temperature magnetization and thermodynamics whenever the external magnetic field drives the investigated spin system above a midpoint of the lowest intermediate 1/5-plateau appearing due to the monomer - tetramer ground state ( [ mt ] ) . under this circumstance ,",
    "the magnetization calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ lmmag ] ) exhibits for @xmath52 a perfect agreement with the ed data on assumption that the temperature is below @xmath143 . compared to this , the derived formula ( [ lmsh ] ) for the specific heat affords a reliable description of the numerical ed data for the same value of the interaction ratio @xmath52 just for much smaller temperatures @xmath144 .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that the height and position of low - temperature maximum of the heat capacity is in an excellent accordance with the numerical ed data provided that the magnetic field is fixed sufficiently close to the saturation field or the field - driven transition between @xmath129- and @xmath127-plateaus .",
    "the present work deals with the ground - state phase diagram , the magnetization process and the low - temperature thermodynamics of the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg octahedral chain , which has been treated by means of various analytical and numerical techniques .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the highly - frustrated parameter region of the ground - state phase diagram can be rigorously found on the grounds of the variational principle and the localized - magnon approach , which provide an exact evidence for the monomer - tetramer ( [ mt ] ) and localized - magnon ( [ lm ] ) ground states at low and high magnetic fields , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the remaining part of the ground - state phase diagram was established through the numerical data gained from dmrg simulations of the effective mixed - spin heisenberg chains , which were additionally corroborated by ed data exploiting lanczos algorithm .",
    "it has been verified that the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg octahedral chain exhibits in this parameter space an unexpected diversity of intriguing ground states including three different quantum ferrimagnetic phases , two spin - liquid phases as well as the unconventional singlet tetramer - hexamer phase ( [ sht ] ) .",
    "the notable diversity of available quantum ground states can also be regarded as a primary reason for astonishing versatility of zero - temperature magnetization curves . as a matter of fact",
    ", the magnetization curves of the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg octahedral chain may involve intermediate plateaus at zero , one - fifth , two - fifth and three - fifth of the saturation magnetization in addition to two gapless spin - liquid regimes with continuously varying magnetization .",
    "the field - driven quantum phase transition between individual ground states can therefore have either character of a first - order phase transition accompanied with a discontinuous magnetization jump or of a second - order phase transition accompanied with a continuous rise of the magnetization .",
    "last but not least , we have developed the modified localized - magnon theory accounting for the lowest - energy one - magnon and two - magnon states , which are essential for a design of the many - magnon states relevant for a proper description of low - temperature thermodynamics of the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg octahedral chain .",
    "the validity and exactness of the developed localized - magnon approach in the highly - frustrated parameter region has been verified through a direct comparison with the full ed data .",
    "it has been found that the localized - magnon theory gives plausible estimate of thermodynamic quantities at low up to moderate temperatures whenever the magnetic field drives the investigated quantum spin system above a midpoint of the intermediate 1/5-plateau due to the monomer - tetramer ( [ mt ] ) phase .",
    "our future goal is to extend a validity of the localized - magnon approach down to zero field , because a steep variation of the magnetization at low magnetic fields is of great potential applicability for low - temperature magnetic refrigeration achieved through the enhanced magnetocaloric effect.@xcite    this work was financially supported by the grant of the ministry of education , science , research and sport of the slovak republic under the contract no .",
