    "here we shall demonstrate how to derive quantum pigeonhole paradoxes from ghz paradoxes obtained from qudit graph states corresponding to ghz graphs @xcite .    a weighted graph is defined by a set @xmath111 of @xmath112 vertices and a set of edges specified by the adjacency matrix @xmath113 whose entry @xmath114 denotes the weight of the edge connecting two vertices @xmath31 .",
    "we consider here only undirected graph without self loop so that the adjacent matrix is symmetric and has zero diagonal entries .",
    "a ghz graph @xcite is defined to be a weighted graph @xmath115 satisfying @xmath116 and @xmath117 as a result @xmath118 must be even and @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "ghz graphs exist for all values of @xmath121 and even values of @xmath118 with some examples shown in fig.3 .",
    "consider a system of @xmath112 qudits labeled with @xmath122 .",
    "for each qudit @xmath123 we denote by @xmath124 its computational basis and by @xmath125 its generalized bit and phase shifts for which it holds @xmath126 and the commutation rule @xmath127 .",
    "we denote @xmath128 the graph state @xmath129 for a given graph @xmath115 is defined by the @xmath4 common eigenstate of @xmath112 commuting unitary observables @xmath130 , i.e. , @xmath131 for all @xmath123 . for a ghz graph it holds @xmath132 based on which we can construct a ghz paradox as well as a state - independent parity proof of ks theorem as shown in table ii .    , respectively .",

    "quantum mechanically , it is clear that we have an identity @xmath144 in noncontextual models @xmath145 observables @xmath140 assume predetermined noncontextual values @xmath146 and the above product with observables replaced by their realistic values , since @xmath147 , is equal to @xmath148 , a contradiction .",

    "for preparation we measure observables @xmath164 with outcomes denoted by @xmath168 , respectively , and for post - selection we still measure observables @xmath153 with outcomes @xmath169 . thus the pre - selected state @xmath98 is the common eigenstate of @xmath164 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath170 while the post - selected state @xmath152 is the common eigenstate of @xmath153 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath155 .",

    "<S> a kind of paradoxical effects has been demonstrated that the pigeonhole principle , i.e. , if three pigeons are put in two pigeonholes then at least two pigeons must stay in the same hole , fails in certain quantum mechanical scenario . </S>",
    "<S> here we shall show how to associate a proof of kochen - specker theorem with a quantum pigeonhole effect and vise versa , e.g. , from state - independent proofs of kochen - specker theorem some kind of state - independent quantum pigeonhole effects can be demonstrated . in particular , a state - independent version of the quantum cheshire cat , which can be rendered as a kind of quantum pigeonhole effect about the trouble of putting two pigeons in two pigeonholes , arises from peres - mermin s magic square proof of contextuality .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum theory confronts us with a reality that is radically different from a classical one because of its contextuality . roughly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , quantum contextuality refers to the property that any realistic theory trying to complete quantum mechanics so as to avoid indeterministic measurement outcomes has to be contextual , i.e. , the predetermined outcomes of measuring an observable may depend on which set of compatible observables that might be measured along side . </S>",
    "<S> this is a seminal no - go theorem proved by kochen and specker ( ks ) @xcite and independently by bell @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bell s nonlocality as revealed by , e.g. , the violation of bell s inequality @xcite or arguments without inequality @xcite , is a special form of contextuality enforced by space - like separation . in different scenarios </S>",
    "<S> there are different proofs of kochen - specker theorem , which can be state - dependent @xcite , state - independent and deterministic @xcite , and statistical yet state - independent @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently a kind of quantum pigeonhole effect @xcite was demonstrated that the pigeonhole principle , which states that if three pigeons are to be put into two pigeonholes then two of the pigeons must stay in the same hole , does not hold in some pre- and post - selection scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is even promoted to be a principle to explore the nature of the quantum correlations . </S>",
    "<S> consider a system of three qubits representing three pigeons in two pigeonholes , i.e. , two eigenstates @xmath0 of @xmath1 , where three pauli matrices and identity matrix are denoted simply by @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> initially the system is prepared in the state @xmath3 , which is the common @xmath4 eigenstate of commuting observables @xmath5 . at the final stage , @xmath6 component of each qubit </S>",
    "<S> is measured @xmath7 and only those outcomes with three + 1 are kept , i.e. , the common @xmath4 eigenstate @xmath8 is post - selected . in the intermediate stage between the preparation and post - selection , one asks what would happen if we had tested whether each pair of two qubits is in the same state or not . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to measure the observable @xmath9 on each pair of qubits @xmath10 and @xmath11 since the outcome @xmath4 or @xmath12 , which corresponds to the projectors @xmath13 , indicates that two qubits are in the same or different states , respectively , with respect to the the computational basis . </S>",
    "<S> it was then argued that the detectors corresponding to @xmath14 would never fire because of the identities @xmath15 as a result the detector corresponding to @xmath16 would always fire for each pair of qubits @xmath17 , meaning that each pair of qubits would have stayed in different states , a violation to the pigeonhole principle .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum pigeonhole effect described above is obviously a kind of pre- and post - selection paradox and , as pointed out by leifer and spekkens @xcite , any such kind of paradox is associated with a proof of quantum contextuality . in any noncontextual realistic model , according to kochen and specker @xcite , there is a so called ks value assignment of @xmath18 to all the rays , i.e. , rank-1 projections , in the relevant hilbert space satisfying the following three rules . </S>",
    "<S> the _ noncontextuality rule _ states that a ray is assigned to value 0 or 1 regardless of which complete orthonormal bases it belongs to , the _ orthogonality rule _ states that two orthogonal rays can not be assigned to value 1 simultaneously , and the _ completeness rule _ states that within a complete basis orthonormal basis there is at least one ray that is assigned to value 1 . </S>",
    "<S> a finite set of rays having no ks value assignment is a proof of the ks theorem , i.e. , a demonstration of quantum contextuality , and the proof is state - dependent if some states are assigned to value 1 _ a priori_. the absence of ks value assignments is sufficient for the nonexistence of a noncontexual model but not necessary . </S>",
    "<S> there are also state - independent proofs admitting ks value assignments @xcite .    in the above demonstration of quantum </S>",
    "<S> pigeonhole effect , by denoting @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the set of all the relevant 34 pure states @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes one of possible cyclic permutations of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , provides a state - dependent proof of ks theorem if @xmath25 and @xmath26 are assigned to value 1 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact for any possible choice of @xmath22 and @xmath27 , both two rays @xmath28 have to be assigned to value 0 because of eq.([cd ] ) and the orthogonality rule . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , either @xmath29 or @xmath30 has to be assigned to value 1 for any given @xmath27 and @xmath31 , according to the completeness rule . or equivalently , all three rank-2 projections @xmath32 must be assigned to value 1 . due to the pigeonhole principle , in each one of the eight computational bases @xmath33 at least two qubits are in the same states and therefore is orthogonal at least to one of the three subspaces with projections @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say all eight computational bases have to be assigned to value 0 , which contradicts the completeness rule .    </S>",
    "<S> all three rules of ks value assignment are also assumed implicitly or explicitly in the demonstration of the quantum pigeonhole effect . </S>",
    "<S> the orthogonality and completeness rules , which can be enforced by aharonov - bergmann - lebowitz rule @xcite for pre- and post - selection , have been used in the arguments against certain outcomes of the intermediate measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the noncontextuality has also been assumed implicitly in the intermediate measurement of the observable @xmath34 for each pair of qubits , which appears in two different measurement contexts in order to extract a contradiction . </S>",
    "<S> the first measurement context is given by @xmath35 which has been used to show that the detector @xmath36 would never fire , i.e. , @xmath34 would take value @xmath12 indication qubit @xmath10 and @xmath11 are in different states . </S>",
    "<S> the second measurement context is given by @xmath37 whose eigenstates represent all possible configurations of three pigeons in two pigeonholes . </S>",
    "<S> there is a contradiction only if the value of @xmath34 obtained in the first context is used in the second context . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that no paradox will be present if the assumption of noncontextuality is dropped . </S>",
    "<S> the counterfactual measurements might yield contextual values .    for other possible outcomes of the post - selection measurement , similar quantum pigeonhole effects can still be demonstrated @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we shall remove further the dependency of the initial state so that we have a state - independent version of the quantum pigeonhole effect . on a system of three qubits </S>",
    "<S> we at first measure the complete set @xmath5 with outcomes @xmath38 being arbitrary , and at the final stage we measure the complete set @xmath7 with outcomes @xmath39 being arbitrary . by the first measurement the system is prepared in the state @xmath40 and by the second measurement the system is post - selected into the state @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> let us now examine what would happen if we had measured @xmath34 at the intermediate stage between the preparation and post - selection . </S>",
    "<S> denoting @xmath42 we have @xmath43 for arbitrary @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the detector @xmath16 ( or @xmath36 ) would never fire if @xmath44 ( or 1 ) so that qubits @xmath10 and @xmath11 would have stayed in the same ( or different ) states , respectively . since @xmath45 there is an even number of pairs of qubits such that @xmath44 , i.e. , among three qubits there is an even number of pairs of qubits that would have stayed in the same state . </S>",
    "<S> this is impossible due to the fact that to put three pigeons into two pigeonholes the number of pairs of pigeons staying in the different holes must be even .        </S>",
    "<S> the above state - independent version of the quantum pigeonhole paradox also gives rise to a state - independent proof of kochen - specker theorem due to waegell and aravind @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this proof includes 48 rays defined by eigenstates of 6 maximal sets of mutually commuting observables @xmath46 with @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> there is an elegant parity proof given by the waegell - aravind s triangle configuration as shown in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> quantum mechanically , the product of three observables connected by each thin ( blue ) straight line is 1 while the product of three observables connected by each thick ( red ) line is @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> . thus the product of all those line products of three observables equals @xmath12 . in a noncontextual realistic theory , where all observables have some predetermined values @xmath48 independent of the contexts , the same product yields value 1 since each observable appears twice in the product .    </S>",
    "<S> any proof of kochen - specker theorem via logical contradiction can give rise to the demonstration of some sort of quantum pigeon effect . </S>",
    "<S> this is because in each ks proof there is at least a basis , one of which can be taken without loss of generality to be the computational basis . </S>",
    "<S> the logical contradiction can be pushed back to the impossibility of the ks value assignment to this computational basis . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the computational bases represent all possible configurations of pigeons in holes and satisfy obviously the orthogonality and completeness rules , i.e. , one and only one configuration is realized . </S>",
    "<S> thus the contradiction as seen in a ks proof can thus be regarded as a violation of some kind of generalized pigeonhole principle . </S>",
    "<S> for example the 3-box paradox @xcite , which is associated with clifton s state - dependent proof of ks theorem @xcite , roughly shows that a single pigeon , when put into three pigeonholes , can stay simultaneously in two holes . </S>",
    "<S> now let us see some more examples .    </S>",
    "<S> as the first example , some kind of robust quantum pigeonhole effect can be demonstrated by using peres - mermin s magic square for three qubits @xcite as shown in table i ( left ) . </S>",
    "<S> let the system be prepared in any state @xmath25 ( may even be mixed ) in the common @xmath4 eigenspace of three observables @xmath49 in the fist row , which is spanned by @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> at the final stage we make a post - selection to any state @xmath26 in the common + 1 eigenspace of three observables @xmath51 in the third row , which is spanned by @xmath52 . at the immediate stage </S>",
    "<S> we ask what would happen if we had measured three observables @xmath53 in the second row , testing whether each pair of qubits was in the same state or not . in this </S>",
    "<S> general setting eq.([cd ] ) still hold so that each pair of qubits would have stayed in different states , a violation to the pigeonhole principle . </S>",
    "<S> the dependency of the pre- and post - selection can be easily removed and the generalization of peres - mermin s magic square as well as the quantum pigeonhole effect to the case of an odd number of qubits is straightforward .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54    as the second example , a kind of paradoxical effect can be demonstrated in the case of two pigeons in two pigeonholes , which turns out to be the quantum cheshire cat @xcite , a curious situation of a grin without a cat encountered by alice only in wonderland and demonstrated recently in a neutron experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider a spin half particle , e.g. , neutron , in an interferometer with two paths , where the cat is represented by the particle and its grin by its spin . </S>",
    "<S> this is effectively a two - qubit system with the first qubit representing the spatial degree of freedom , i.e. , the path , while the second qubit representing its spin . </S>",
    "<S> let the system be prepared initially in the state @xmath55 and post - selected to @xmath56 at the final stage . because @xmath57 the particle would take path @xmath58 if we had observed its path , where we have denoted by @xmath59 the projection to the eigenspace of observable @xmath60 corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath61 with @xmath62 . because @xmath63 if we had observed its spin components along @xmath64 direction the answer would be spin up @xmath65 . because @xmath66 we see that the path and the spin are anti - correlated , i.e. </S>",
    "<S> , if the spin is up @xmath65 then the path @xmath67 should be taken while if the spin is down @xmath68 then the path @xmath58 should be taken . to sum up , </S>",
    "<S> given the pre and post - selection , the particle would surely travel along path @xmath69 and its spin would be up along @xmath64 direction while the path and spin would be anti - correlated , i.e. , its spin would be measured along a different path @xmath70 from what is taken by the particle , i.e. , @xmath69 , which is exactly our quantum cheshire cat . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstration of quantum cheshire cat , being a kind of pre- and post - selection paradox , also gives rise to a state - dependent proof of kochen - specker theorem including the eigenstates of @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 in addition to @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    by considering suitable pre- and post - selection measurements the dependency of the quantum cheshire cat on the preparation and post - selection </S>",
    "<S> can be removed . for the preparation we measure observables @xmath74 while for the post - selection we measure observables @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> thus initially the system is prepared in the state @xmath76 which is the common eigenstate of @xmath77 and @xmath78 corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , with @xmath81 , and post - selected into the state @xmath82 with @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the following three observations constitute the quantum cheshire cat . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , if we had observed which path were taken by the particle we would find the particle in the path @xmath84 with @xmath85 since @xmath86 vanishes otherwise . secondly , if we had observed the spin along @xmath64 direction we would find the spin in the state @xmath87 with @xmath88 since @xmath89 vanishes otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , if we had observed the correlation @xmath90 then the detector @xmath91 would never fire if @xmath92 because in this case @xmath93 vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the spin state @xmath87 , as revealed by the measurement @xmath94 , has to be correlated with the path @xmath95 which is different from the path @xmath96 taken by the particle as revealed by the measurement @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> this state - independent version of the quantum cheshire cat turns out to be exactly the parity proof by peres - mermin s magic square @xcite as shown in table i ( right ) . </S>",
    "<S> three commuting observables in three columns are taken as the post - selection , intermediate , and preparation measurements respectively . </S>",
    "<S> if we take three sets of row observables instead then we obtain a paradoxical effect that it is impossible to put two pigeons in two holes in a pre- and post - selection scenario .        </S>",
    "<S> as the last example , let us see how to derive pigeonhole effects from greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) paradoxes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider mermin s magic pentagram proof of ks theorem for three qubits as shown in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> let the system be prepared in the ghz state @xmath98 , i.e. , one of the common eigenstates of three commuting observables @xmath99 , with @xmath22 being one of three cyclic permutations of @xmath23 , corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath100 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> as the post - selection we measure observables @xmath5 with outcomes denoted by @xmath101 , i.e. , the post - selection state is @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that outcomes must satisfy @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 since otherwise we will have orthogonal pre- and post - selected states @xmath106 for each successful pre- and post - selection , if we had measured observables @xmath34 for @xmath17 then we would register outcome @xmath107 because otherwise @xmath108 would vanish . since @xmath109 indicates </S>",
    "<S> whether two qubits are in the same state ( computational basis ) or not , from @xmath110 it follows that there is an odd number of qubit pairs in different state , which is impossible because if we put three pigeons in two holes the number of pairs of pigeons in different state should be even . </S>",
    "<S> this is a state - independent version of an early proposal of the pigeonhole effect @xcite using entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> ghz paradoxes for multi ( even ) levels systems and multi particles can be systematically constructed from the so called ghz graph @xcite and corresponding graph states . </S>",
    "<S> each paradox will give rise to a similar quantum pigeonhole effect as above ( see appendix ) .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we have established an intimate relation between the quantum pigeonhole effects and proofs of ks theorem . on the one hand </S>",
    "<S> this relation enables us to understand those paradoxical effects in terms of contextuality , since the assumption of noncontextuality is indispensable in all these paradoxical effects . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> this relation helps to obtain from known proofs of ks theorem some other interesting effects , such as state - independent versions and the impossibility of putting two pigeons in more than two pigeonholes . </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly , the latter effect is related to the quantum cheshire cat , for which we also find a state - independent version with the help of peres - mermin s magic square . from the experimental point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the removal of the dependency on the post - selection states enhances the success probability by 300% . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , it will be interesting to find out what kinds of paradoxical effects correspond to those ks proofs without logical contradictions .    </S>",
