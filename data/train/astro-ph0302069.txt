    "the production of the isotopes of lithium , beryllium and boron ( libeb ) from the spallation of @xmath0 , @xmath1  and   in the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) by protons and alpha particles in the cosmic rays ( crs ) outlined in @xcite filled the last major gap in the understanding of the origin the elements .",
    "this method of manufacture ( dubbed galactic cosmic ray nucleosynthesis ( gcrn ) or cosmic ray spallation ) is thought to be the sole source of @xmath2 , @xmath3and @xmath4 and thus observations of their abundances give clues to the contribution of spallogenic @xmath5  and @xmath6  to the total abundance of these nuclei .",
    "the fragility and paucity of these elements renders the derivation of their abundances from stellar spectra challenging but despite this difficulty data now exists over a wide range of metallicity @xcite . after comparing the observations with the predictions of theory",
    "many conclusions have been drawn : for example the discrepancy between the observed solar @xmath6/@xmath4 isotopic ratio of 4.05  @xcite with the spallogenic prediction of @xmath7 @xcite indicates another source of @xmath6  must exist .",
    "the strength of this , and indeed any , conclusion ultimately relies on the validity of the underlying approximations that permeate the gcrn calculation of which there are many . within the sources of error",
    "there are two that emerge from the nuclear physics aspects of the problem .",
    "the first is the straight - ahead approximation which assumes that the fragment emerges from a reaction with a velocity equal to that of the projectile , while the second is that the only significant source of libeb is the direct , one - step , production from the spalling of the cno and that production via intermediaries is insignificant .",
    "the use of both of these approximations is widespread but remains largely untested .",
    "relaxing either considerably increases the complexity of the calculation yet this is exactly our intention in this paper . in section  [ sec : basics ] we present the basics of cosmic ray calculations in the leaky box model , show how the reaction expansion is invoked and how the straight - ahead approximation enters .",
    "then in section ",
    "[ sec : testingstraightahead ] we relax the straight - ahead approximation and demonstrate the implications for the production rates and flux of the secondary nuclei . in section ",
    "[ sec : twostep ] we include the two - step processes in the reaction rates and then , motivated by these results , we proceed to section  [ sec : fullcascade ] where we use a cascade technique to calculate the production rates exactly .",
    "the theoretical underpinning for the study of cosmic rays is a propagation model that relates a source spectrum to the flux observed at a later time and place . of the theoretical models",
    "used the most popular for the calculation of the rates of production of @xmath2 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath6  is the leaky - box model ( see e.g. @xcite ) or its variants .",
    "the model is simpler and more transparent than the rival diffusion model but it suffers from number of deficiencies , both theoretical and when used to fit some cosmic ray data . despite this failing",
    "the use of the model is widespread because it has empirically proven to be useful in fitting compositional cosmic ray data which is the focus of this paper .    in the leaky box model the flux of a cosmic ray species",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the source of particles , the mass density of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is represented by @xmath10 and the integrating factor @xmath11 has a physical interpretation as the probability that a particle produced with energy @xmath12 will survive to form part of the ism .",
    "this survival probability is simply @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the energy per nucleon lost per unit distance traversed and per unit mass density of the medium and @xmath15 is the path length or grammage .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is frequently called the current , the rate of flow of particles from high to low energy , so that in the limit when @xmath17 all the particles at a given energy will eventually accumulate at @xmath18 i.e. they form part of the ism .",
    "this limit is achieved when @xmath19 so the rate of change of the abundance @xmath20 is therefore @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number density of hydrogen in the ism .",
    "so far we have not distinguished between the different nuclei under consideration since equations ( [ eq : phi ] ) , ( [ eq : sfactor ] ) and ( [ eq : production rate ] ) are valid for each regardless of how the different species become cosmic rays .",
    "there are differences of course , the flux of cno is almost entirely that accelerated from the ism whereas the flux of libeb is almost entirely produced ` in - flight ' so to speak .",
    "we can thus make a distinction between two types of sources @xmath9 : a primary spectrum @xmath23 from whatever mechanism is responsible for acceleration of particles from the ism , and a secondary production term @xmath24 that is due to particle reactions between primary crs and the constituents of the ism .",
    "cosmic rays are classified by whichever is dominant .",
    "the production term @xmath24 is simply the sum of all the reactions that can make the nucleus we are interested in , so we have @xmath25 where we have used the superscripts / subscript @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 to denote the quantities associated with the projectile , target or fragment of the reaction @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the number density of targets , @xmath31 is the cross - section for the reaction and @xmath32 is the probability distribution for the fragment energy @xmath33 at a given projectile energy @xmath34 .",
    "at this point we expanded the projectile flux @xmath35 as @xmath36 , the reasoning will become clear in a moment , and insert this expression into equation ( [ eq : qreaction ] ) so that the secondary source for the fragment @xmath37 becomes @xmath38 which introduces the expansion over @xmath39 .",
    "note that this expansion begins at @xmath40 not @xmath41 because @xmath42 is already in use as the primary source spectrum for nucleus @xmath28 .",
    "we can now bundle together the primary and secondary sources we introduced in equation ( [ eq : qsum ] ) into one expression : @xmath43 .",
    "now we can also expand the fragment s flux @xmath44 in exactly the same fashion as the projectile flux @xmath35 so that equation ( [ eq : phi ] ) , now reads @xmath45 if we equate terms in @xmath46 we achieve our final result @xmath47 the meaning of the expansion now becomes clear , we have expanded the fragment flux @xmath44 over the number of reactions that lead from a given projectile @xmath26 to the desired fragment @xmath28 because @xmath48 , defined in equation ( [ eq : qexpansion ] ) , depends upon the fluxes of projectiles @xmath49 .",
    "thus @xmath50 is the flux that is accelerated from the ism , @xmath51 denotes the flux produced by interactions involving @xmath52 , @xmath53 is that which arises from reactions involving @xmath54 and so on .    inserting the same expansion of @xmath55 into equation ( [ eq : production rate ] ) leads to a similar expansion of the rate of change of abundance @xmath56 as a sum of terms @xmath57 where each contribution is from the source term @xmath48 @xmath58 we return our attention to equation ( [ eq : qexpansion ] ) and the first term in the reaction source expansion @xmath59",
    "this is the term that corresponds to the formation of @xmath28 via a single interaction of a primary cr and the ism , i.e. the one - step source .",
    "we can break this quantity apart into the sum from each projectile / target pair and likewise expand @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the same fashion with each term representing the contribution from the source term @xmath62 .",
    "lastly , the primary projectile flux @xmath63 may be rewritten as @xmath64 so that the integral over the projectile s energy per nucleon @xmath34 yields @xmath65 , the total number of projectiles per unit time and per unit area .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 acts as the flux strength and we can therefore remove the trivial dependence upon the chemistry of the crs .",
    "the rate of change of the abundance in the ism and the flux of nucleus @xmath28 are thus @xmath66 where @xmath67 equations ( [ eq : ronestep ] ) and ( [ eq : psionestep ] ) serve to define the normalized , one - step reaction rate @xmath68 and the normalized , one - step flux @xmath69 .    with",
    "the basics complete we can fill in some of the mundane details of the calculation .",
    "the set of nuclei we will use for both the ism and crs are p/  and @xmath70/@xmath71  plus all the stable nuclei from @xmath2through to  .",
    "in addition we must add @xmath72 and @xmath73 to our set of nuclei found in the crs because their decay mode is inner orbital electron capture and so are stable in the ionized state .",
    "we will sometimes denote by @xmath74 the subset of nuclei with mass greater than @xmath71 .",
    "the stopping power @xmath75 is tabulated up to @xmath76 for each fragment by @xcite . above this energy",
    "we use the stopping power for protons as tabulated by @xcite and rescale in exactly the same manner as @xcite .",
    "the important cross - sections needed for our calculation were tabulated by @xcite but there is no cross - sectional data involving @xmath72 and @xmath73 as a reactant so we have appealed to the fact that each is the mirror of a nucleus for which data does exist and therefore assume that the cross - section for reactions involving @xmath72 or @xmath73 is the same as for it s isobaric brother . for the primary cr spectrum we adopt the form presented by @xcite and used by @xcite and @xcite @xmath77 we have set the parameter @xmath78 to be the nucleon mass @xmath79 though we note @xcite preferred a value of @xmath80 .",
    "the last quantity we need to specify is the fragment energy distribution @xmath32 .",
    "this quantity has been historically approximated with a @xmath81-function form known as the straight - ahead approximation .",
    "the approximation is divided into two , the selection being dependent upon the identity of the projectile @xmath26 , @xmath82 note that in the case of @xmath83 there is _ no _ flux of the fragment f.    we compile the one - step production rates @xmath68 as calculated by equation ( [ eq : ronestep ] ) using two , constant values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in table",
    "( [ tab : ronestep ] ) only those where the reactants are p/  and  .",
    "an initial examination of the results shows that loss of the fragments when @xmath86 reduces the production rate by a factor @xmath87 relative to the rate when the projectile and target are interchanged . while this may appear to render the inverse reactions unimportant",
    "it must be remembered that , at the present time , the abundances of many of the @xmath74 nuclei in the cr are enhanced relative to their ism values by approximately equivalent factors . finally , we also see from the table that increasing the grammage leads to a larger fraction of libeb captured from the inverse reactions and so increasing the efficiency of production .",
    "in section  [ sec : basics ] we used the straight - ahead approximation to calculate @xmath88 and @xmath69 and we now wish to test its validity .",
    "an examination of the approximation was made by @xcite who replaced it with another @xmath81-function but with different relation between the fragment and primary energies while @xcite conducted a test for heavy nuclei that included a spread in fragment energy .",
    "it is the direction of @xcite that we shall explore .",
    "the momentum distributions of the isotopes produced by fragmentation of various projectile and target nuclei are discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the distributions from experiment are found to be normally distributed in the rest frame of the spalled nucleus @xmath74 with narrow dispersions and a small mean momentum in the direction parallel to the incident projectile . in particular the momentum distributions of the fragments from @xmath0  and   projectiles upon various targets ranging in mass from be to pb were measured by @xcite who found that their results had no significant correlation with target mass or beam energy .",
    "@xcite , and more recently @xcite , explain these results in terms of a nuclear model with minimal correlations between the nucleon momenta .",
    "they predict the dependence of the momentum per nucleon distribution @xmath89 of a fragment with mass @xmath90 to be @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the momentum per nucleon of the fragment in the rest - frame of @xmath74 , @xmath93 is the mean and @xmath94 the variance of the distribution . to obtain @xmath32 when @xmath95 we must integrate equation ( [ eq : ppf ] ) over all momenta @xmath92 that yield @xmath33 and make use of the fact that @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath97 where @xmath98 is the energy associated with @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath100 . after a little effort this produces @xmath101 .",

    "we have ignored the decreases in @xmath114 that occur for values of e@xmath115 mev / nucleon indicated by @xcite : at such small energies , and with our choices of @xmath116 , the value of @xmath117 is very close to unity and every fragment isotope is captured by the galaxy rendering the decrease in @xmath114 irrelevant .",
    "the expression for @xmath118 in equation ( [ eq : meanp ] ) diverges as @xmath119 becomes small so it must be replaced by another in this limit .",
    "the substitute we have used is @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the lighter mass of the interacting nuclei @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this equation assumes the fragment carries a fraction @xmath122 of the projectile momentum in the frame where the heavier nucleus is at rest and the changeover from equation ( [ eq : meanp ] ) to ( [ eq : altmeanp ] ) again occurs at energies @xmath123 .",
    "@xcite state that such a change is expected to occur at roughly this energy .",
    "the two probability distributions are shown in figures ( [ fig : pexactpa ] ) and ( [ fig : pexactz ] ) for the interaction of p/@xmath124 and   to produce @xmath3  when the lorentz factor of the projectile is @xmath125 .",
    "the figures show that the emerging beryllium energy is peaked below @xmath126 for the forward case and that the spread in beryllium energy for the inverse reaction is considerable .    with the probability distributions",
    "now under control it is straight forward to calculate the rates of production and the flux by inserting the distributions into equations ( [ eq : ronestep ] ) and ( [ eq : psionestep ] ) .",
    "we compile the rates again for @xmath127 and @xmath128 which we show in table ( [ tab : ronestepnosa ] ) again only for the reactions involving p/@xmath124  with  .",
    "after comparing with the results in table ( [ tab : ronestep ] ) we can see that straight - ahead approximation accurately predicts the production rate for the forward reactions .",
    "this result was to be expected : the distribution of the fragment energy in localized to @xmath129 as shown in figure ( [ fig : pexactpa ] ) and at these energies the range ( the distance travelled by a particle before coming to rest per unit mass density of the medium ) is much shorter than @xmath116 so all fragments are trapped . after examining the inverse reactions we see a slight increase ( @xmath130 ) in the production rates relative to the straight - ahead calculations but",
    "the differences are small and do not warrant rejection of the approximation .",
    "the differences are of a similar magnitude as those found by @xcite .",
    "the approximation s success again has a simple explanation : the dispersion of the beryllium energy @xmath131 is only of order @xmath132 and so @xmath133 .",
    "so far we have only considered the first term @xmath59 in the reaction expansion from equation ( [ eq : qexpansion ] ) but now we turn our attention to the second term , @xmath134 , to determine its contribution to the rate of change the abundance .    if the fragment @xmath135 from the reaction @xmath136 undergoes a subsequent reaction @xmath137 then from equation ( [ eq : qexpansion ] ) we have @xmath138 inserting the expansion for @xmath139 and the expression for @xmath140 from equation ( [ eq : phiptf ] ) then @xmath141 where the flux @xmath142 appearing in equation ( [ eq : q2 ] ) is the normalized one - step flux that was defined in equation ( [ eq : phiptf ] ) . introducing the quantity @xmath143 as the contribution to equation ( [ eq : q2 ] ) from each triplet @xmath144 and",
    "then inserting the result into equation ( [ eq : dyidt ] ) allows us to define a normalized two - step @xmath145 by @xmath146 so that @xmath147 we have calculated these two - step reaction rates @xmath145 again for @xmath148 and @xmath149 using our improvement of the fragment energy distribution from section ",
    "[ sec : testingstraightahead ] and in table ( [ tab : rtwostepnosa ] ) we show the results for the reactions involving p/@xmath124 and  . for the forward cases , i.e. when @xmath150 , we find that the two - step rates vary in magnitude from @xmath151 for @xmath2 to @xmath152 for @xmath6  whereas the inverse rates , i.e. @xmath153 , are all around @xmath154 .",
    "the forward rates are very sensitive to the threshold energies of the reactions @xmath137 since the fluxes of @xmath135 peak at very low energies as indicated by figure ( [ fig : pexactpa ] ) . in both cases",
    "these rates certainly appear much smaller than those in tables ( [ tab : ronestep ] ) and ( [ tab : ronestepnosa ] ) and it is tempting to regard the two - step rates are negligible .",
    "however this would be an erroneous conclusion because attention must be given to the pre - factors of equation ( [ eq : rpttf ] ) . for an ism of only @xmath124 and @xmath155with a mass fraction of @xmath155 of y the @xmath156 term is @xmath157 including this factor we see that the forward rates are at least five orders of magnitude smaller than the one - step rates in table ( [ tab : ronestepnosa ] ) .",
    "in contrast , when we apply the @xmath156 pre - factor to the inverse rates that we find they are only @xmath158 smaller ! this same result was found by @xcite who also saw substantial changes to their calculations of the ratios of production rates when they included the two - step contributions .    this result may seem surprising but it is not entirely unexpected .",
    "the inefficient retardation of the crs means that the flux of intermediaries @xmath135 accumulates over a long period of time .",
    "the flux of @xmath135 is only @xmath159 smaller than the primary @xmath52 .",
    "after we factor in the smaller average energy of the intermediaries ( which will result in a higher fraction of trapped fragments ) and the multiplicity of the two - step channels we obtain two - step production rates that are comparable with the one - step .",
    "the significant two - step contribution to the rate of change of abundances means that we must evaluate the higher order terms in the expansion of @xmath39 . at the two - step level",
    "the number of reaction rates we must compute is considerable , if we find equally large contributions from the three - step reactions and greater then the computational burden becomes excessive . at this point",
    "we would have to abandon this approach to spallation calculations , so we must either show that the three - step contribution is negligible or we must find an alternative and more efficient approach to the calculation of production rates .",
    "the three - step rates are , in principle , simple to compute since we proceed in the same fashion as the one and two - step equations we derived in sections ",
    "[ sec : basics ] and  [ sec : twostep ] . in practice",
    "there are so many pathways between any given primary projectile @xmath160 and the fragment @xmath161 under consideration that the procedure becomes increasingly laborious .",
    "instead we adopt the approach of @xcite and utilize the simple property that in any spallation reaction the fragment is always lighter than the heavier reactant .",
    "we begin by splitting the flux @xmath162 of any nucleus a into the sum of two components , the primary @xmath163 accelerated from the ism and then the secondary flux @xmath164 . the secondary flux @xmath164 is dependent upon the fluxes of all the nuclei b heavier than a which again are sum of primary and secondary components .",
    "thus we have @xmath165 and @xmath166 where @xmath167 represents the successive application of the linear equations ( [ eq : qreaction ] ) and ( [ eq : phi ] ) .",
    "the secondary flux of the lightest member of @xmath168 is expressible as @xmath169 and so it can be eliminated from the function for @xmath170 .",
    "we continue consecutive elimination of the lightest secondary flux in the expression for @xmath170 until we reach the heaviest nucleus we are considering .",
    "the flux of this heaviest nucleus does not have a secondary flux by construction so we find that @xmath164 is a function only of primary fluxes @xmath171 .",
    "we therefore introduce the quantity @xmath172 as the contribution to @xmath164 from each primary flux which we label by @xmath160 @xmath173 inserting this expression into equation ( [ eq : qreaction ] ) for @xmath35 we obtain @xmath174 where we use the symbol @xmath175 instead of @xmath26 to emphasize that the second term involves reactions between fragments and the ism .",
    "the set of fragments @xmath175 is a subset of the @xmath74 nuclei so the ism targets @xmath27 in the second term of equation ( [ eq : qscascade ] ) can only be @xmath124 or @xmath155 ( we have been ignoring @xmath176 reactions ) and therefore the fragment @xmath28 must be lighter than @xmath175 .",
    "we introduce the quantities @xmath177 as the contribution to this equation from each term of the expansion over @xmath160 and ` normalize ' the primary flux as @xmath178 in exactly the same way as section ",
    "[ sec : basics ] in order to extract the dependence upon the composition of the crs .",
    "after their introduction we reach the most important expression of this section : @xmath179 we have introduced the symbol @xmath180 as the lightest fragment @xmath175 from which @xmath28 may be produced in the reaction with @xmath27 while the upper limit to the sum , @xmath181 , is the heaviest nucleus that can be formed after an interaction of @xmath160 with any component of the ism .",
    "we have denoted this nucleus suggestively by @xmath181 but we note that in the case of @xmath182 the heaviest intermediary @xmath175 is formed from the heaviest component of the ism . equation ( [ eq : cascade ] ) shows that the source @xmath177 is the sum of the one - step contributions @xmath183 plus the reactions involving all secondary nuclei @xmath175 and @xmath27 .",
    "this equation applies to any fragment @xmath28 and as the mass of @xmath28 increases the number of intermediaries becomes smaller .",
    "however a major change occurs when @xmath184 because for this nucleus there are no intermediaries that can produce @xmath28 , only the one - step process involving @xmath160 and @xmath27 manufacture @xmath184 . for this nucleus",
    "the source spectrum @xmath185 is calculated with only the first half of equation ( [ eq : cascade ] ) i.e @xmath186 the spectrum @xmath187 , and hence the flux @xmath188 , are proportional to @xmath189 and therefore we introduce the normalized flux @xmath190 in the same fashion as we did in section  [ sec : basics ] so that @xmath191 every quantity on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : phip0 - 1 ] ) is known so the flux @xmath188 is exact .",
    "now that we have @xmath192 we turn our attention to @xmath193 , the heaviest fragment that can be produced from @xmath194 . for @xmath195",
    "the sum over intermediaries @xmath175 in equation ( [ eq : cascade ] ) involves only the fragment @xmath194 and we insert our solution for @xmath196 from equation ( [ eq : phip0 - 1 ] ) . both @xmath197 and @xmath198",
    "are already known so the source spectrum @xmath199 , and hence the flux @xmath200 , may also be calculated exactly . as we step down through the nuclei",
    "the source spectrum @xmath177 of any fragment @xmath28 is only dependent upon fluxes that are previously derived and so we do not introduce any errors into @xmath177 .",
    "even the @xmath201 fusion reactions that produce @xmath2 and @xmath5  can be accommodated in this scheme by first calculating @xmath202 and then appropriately inserting this solution into the expression for @xmath203 . for every fragment @xmath28",
    "the source spectrum is proportional to @xmath189 and so we write the rate of change of abundance for @xmath28 for a given primary as @xmath204 which defines the normalized cascade rate @xmath205 .",
    "previously we extracted the dependence upon the ism abundances @xmath206 but we have refrained in this cascade calculation because if we do then we run into the same problem as the reaction expansion , namely , vast arrays of rates to calculate for all the possible pathways from the primary @xmath160 to @xmath28 . in order to calculate the source spectra , the fluxes of the intermediaries and the rate @xmath205 we need to specify a composition for the ism",
    "this introduces a chemical dependence we have been at pains to avoid but the sufficient accuracy of the one - step rates for the forward reactions , when @xmath207 , means that we only follow this cascade for @xmath208 which is why we called the heaviest intermediary @xmath181 . in the inverse calculations",
    "the heavy - element content of the ism is irrelevant since all the reactions are with @xmath124 and @xmath155 as targets so we only need specify the abundance of helium in the ism .",
    "the dependence upon the ism chemistry is therefore very weak since @xmath209 is essentially constant . in table",
    "( [ tab : rcascade ] ) we show the cascade rates @xmath205 for the case when the primary projectile is oxygen together with the rate as calculated by using the reaction expansion up to the two - step order .",
    "the grammage is set at the constant value of @xmath127 , we use the straight - ahead approximation and the helium abundance is set to @xmath210 .",
    "it is clear from the table that the cascade and reaction - expansion rates agree to @xmath211 and thus we conclude that terminating the reaction expansion at the two - step level gives sufficiently accurate rates that the difference between the two methods is negligible .",
    "the results of any calculation of the spallogenic rates of production for lithium , beryllium and boron often find their application in trying to remove this synthesis mechanism from the observations in order to elucidate the other contributions to the abundances .",
    "similarly , the ratio of the production rates has been frequently used to infer the spallogenic abundance of one of the libeb elements after observation of another .",
    "both applications rely on the accuracy of the calculated rates so erroneous results can occur if the estimates for the contribution to the abundance from spallation are wrong .",
    "there are many aspects of the calculation where errors can enter but two do not have astrophysical origins : the straight - ahead approximation and the reaction expansion .",
    "we find that relaxing the straight - ahead approximation does increase the complexity of the problem because the distribution of the fragment energies must be taken into account but that using a more sophisticated description produces changes that are less than @xmath212 .",
    "this is too small to insist that the straight - ahead approximation be rejected at the present time .",
    "much larger changes were found when we included the two - step terms from the reaction expansion so that our faith in this methodology waned .",
    "however , after computing the rates to all order we found changes that the difference between the cascade and two - step rates is only a few percent and therefore sufficiently accurate rates can be calculated by terminating the reaction expansion at the two - step term .",
    "we therefore conclude that the errors arising from two assumptions in the nuclear physics aspects of the calculation can be removed leaving only that from the uncertainty in the cross - sections .",

    "<S> the spallative production rates of lithium , beryllium and boron ( libeb ) are a necessary component in any calculation of the evolution of these nuclei in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> previous calculations of these rates relied on two assumptions relating to the nuclear physics aspects : the straight - ahead approximation that describes the distribution of fragment energies and the assumption that the major contributor to the production rate arises from single - step reactions between primary cosmic ray projectiles and interstellar medium targets . </S>",
    "<S> we examine both assumptions by using a semi - empirical description for the spall s energy distribution and by including the reactions that proceed via intermediary fragments . after relaxing the straight - ahead approximation </S>",
    "<S> we find the changes in the production rates and emerging fluxes are small and do not warrant rejection of this approximation . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast we discover that two - step reactions can alter the production rate considerably leading to noticeable increases in the efficiency of producing the libeb nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this result we introduce a cascade technique to compute the production rates exactly and find that the results differ only slightly from those of our two - step calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that terminating the reaction network at the two - step order is sufficiently accurate for current studies of spallation . </S>"
