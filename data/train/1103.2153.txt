    "the nasa _ kepler _  mission @xcite is designed to search for exoplanets by detecting transit events , and early results have demonstrated the spectacular quality of _ kepler _ s ultra - precise photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this will enable unprecedented measurements of the characteristic properties of agn optical variability .",
    "one of the key motivations for measurement of high - precision agn light curves is to determine the power spectrum of continuum fluctuations and to search for any characteristic timescales of variability ( in the form of breaks or slope changes in the power spectrum of variations ) , which might be related to light - crossing , dynamical , or thermal timescales in the accretion disk . at x - ray energies ,",
    "long - duration light curves have been used to search for breaks in the power spectral density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the break timescales are observed to be dependent on both black hole mass and luminosity across a range extending from x - ray binaries to quasars @xcite .",
    "there is accumulating evidence that the optical fluctuations of agns also contain characteristic timescales that may depend on black hole mass and luminosity @xcite .",
    "ground - based optical light curves of agns are limited in quality by nightly and seasonal sampling , weather , and seeing - dependent errors , but _",

    ", we present the results of a six - month , ground - based , optical reverberation - mapping program for the _ kepler _  target zw 229 - 015 ( at @xmath10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the goal of determining the black hole mass in this galaxy from its h@xmath0  reverberation lag .",
    "this galaxy ( also known as cgcg 229 - 015 or 2masx j19052592 + 4227398 ) was first identified as a type 1 seyfert by @xcite . since then , no follow - up observations of this agn have been reported in the literature at all , aside from its inclusion in _ rosat _ all - sky survey source catalogs @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , zw 229 - 015 is one of the nearest and brightest agns in the _ kepler _  field , and it was selected as a monitoring target for the first two cycles of _ kepler _  observations . to assess its suitability for ground - based monitoring , we obtained a test spectroscopic exposure at the lick observatory 3  m shane telescope in april 2010 .",
    "this observation reconfirmed the seyfert 1 classification , and we then selected it for the reverberation mapping program reported here . in this paper , we describe our imaging and spectroscopic observations of zw 229 - 015 , the measurements of the continuum and emission - line light curves and the broad emission - line reverberation lag , and an estimate of the black hole mass based on the h@xmath0  lag and line width .",
    "reverberation measurements require a light curve of the agn continuum , and we obtained @xmath1-band photometry of zw 229 - 015 following the same strategy used in recent reverberation programs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although ground - based measurements can not approach the accuracy or sampling cadence of the _ kepler _  data , they allowed us to monitor the target s variability continuously during the course of our observing program .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath1-band photometry gives a nearly line - free measurement of the galaxy s continuum flux , while the broad _ kepler _  spectral response includes the h@xmath3  and h@xmath0  lines from the agn .",
    "we obtained regularly scheduled @xmath1-band imaging at the 0.76  m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ) at lick observatory , and at the 0.9  m telescope at the brigham young university west mountain observatory ( wmo ) . at both telescopes ,",

    "exposures were 300  s from the start of monitoring until september 7 , and were decreased to 200  s thereafter because of the higher sensitivity of the fairchild ccd .",

    "the photometric measurements were carried out with a range of aperture sizes .",
    "we found that the 4  aperture radius gave the cleanest light curves , and our final photometry is based on this aperture size .",
    "the background sky annulus had inner and outer radii of 8  and 144 .",
    "when more than one exposure was taken per night at a given telescope , the measurements were averaged together to give a single data point for that night .",
    "photometric calibration was accomplished by carrying out aperture photometry on the @xcite standard stars observed at wmo and the nickel telescope on nights that were judged to be photometric by the observers .",
    "we used only @xmath1-band exposures and did not attempt to derive any color - dependent terms for the transformation between instrumental and calibrated @xmath1 magnitudes .",

    "some observations taken in cloudy conditions had very low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , and we excluded any measurement having a formal uncertainty greater than 0.03 mag .",
    "we also discarded measurements from a few images that suffered from very poor flat - fielding or other problems .",
    "the resulting light curve is illustrated in figure [ vlightcurve ] .",
    "the photometric uncertainties listed in table [ phottable ] are the values returned by the photometry routine , which depend on photon - counting statistics for the object and background as well as on readout noise .",
    "these are likely to be underestimates of the true uncertainties , since additional errors can result from flat - fielding irregularities , point - spread function variations , and other issues .",
    "one way to estimate the actual photometric uncertainties is to examine the magnitude fluctuations in the comparison - star light curves , which are presumed to be intrinsically nonvariable .",
    "comparison stars 3 , 4 , and 5 have @xmath1 magnitudes very similar to that of zw 229 - 015 . for each of these stars we examined the scatter of measurements about the mean magnitude , and found standard deviations of 0.0110.016 mag ( see table [ compstarstable ] ) , while the median value of the formal photometric error on a single measurement for these stars is 0.006 mag .",
    "this discrepancy shows that the photon - counting statistics are usually not the dominant contributor to the error budget , except when the images have very low s / n .",
    "we address this issue by adding an additional error term in quadrature to the photometric uncertainties prior to carrying out the cross - correlation measurements , as described in  [ reverbsection ] .",
    "our photometric aperture includes a substantial portion of the host galaxy , including essentially the entire bulge and much of the bar and disk .",
    "we do not attempt to subtract off this host - galaxy starlight contribution to the light - curve points , because our ground - based imaging does not have sufficiently high resolution to decompose the agn point source and bulge into separate components . removing this constant contribution of host - galaxy starlight would not affect the measurement of the reverberation lag .",
    "a condensed version of the @xmath1-band light curve was prepared for the cross - correlation measurements by taking a weighted average of any photometric data taken within 5 hours of each other .",
    "this produces a light curve with at most one data point per night .",
    "the condensed light curve was then converted from magnitudes to linear flux units .",
    "the spectroscopic monitoring program at the lick 3  m shane telescope was carried out by several independent observing teams .",
    "unlike other recent reverberation datasets that were obtained via long - duration , dedicated campaigns of classically scheduled observing nights , we chose to obtain synoptic monitoring of this single target by enlisting the entire community of observers using the kast spectrograph at lick during summer and fall 2010 .",
    "the kast spectrograph is mounted at the cassegrain focus of the 3  m telescope for about half of each lunation , and the spectrograph is used for a variety of programs including supernova and transient follow - up observations , stellar spectroscopy , and agn surveys . during each kast observing night , the regularly scheduled observers took a 1200  s exposure of zw 229 - 015 to contribute to this monitoring program .",
    "this strategy enabled us to collect a spectroscopic dataset with almost nightly sampling during each dark run , except for weather - related losses .",
    "the spectroscopic monitoring began with one observation in may , and then continued with nightly observations during each dark run ( weather permitting ) from june through mid - december .",
    "from june through september , nearly every night was clear enough to observe , while october through december had more substantial weather losses , as is typical for mt .",
    "hamilton ( the site of lick observatory ) .",
    "table [ spectable ] gives a log of the kast observations for the 54 nights when useful data were obtained .",
    "we have omitted data from two nights when zw 229 - 015 was observed through very thick clouds , resulting in a s / n that was too low to be useful for any measurements .",
    "each observing team used a different instrumental setup for the spectrograph , designed for their primary science programs . on the blue side of the spectrograph ,",
    "all observers used the 600-line grism , which gives a dispersion close to 1.0    pixel@xmath7 .",
    "the spectral range falling on the blue - side detector is controlled by adjusting the ccd position via a manually movable stage , resulting in a fixed wavelength coverage for the entire night s observations .",
    "most observing teams set the ccd to a position that covered @xmath285520   , placing the h@xmath0  and [ ] @xmath294959 , 5007 lines on the blue ccd .",
    "however , on several nights a bluer setup covering @xmath305150    or @xmath315135    was used , and with this setup the [ ] @xmath325007 line fell off the edge of the blue ccd , while the @xmath324959 line was still present .    for the red side of the spectrograph ,",
    "several gratings are available and different gratings were installed on different nights . since we could not ensure the same degree of consistency in the red - side observations as was obtained on the blue side , the red - side observations were a lower priority for this project . on some nights zw 299 - 015",
    "was not observed at all on the red side . when it was observed , gratings of 300 , 600 , and 1200 lines mm@xmath7  were used for the red - side observations , with dispersions ranging from 1.2 to 4.6    pixel@xmath7 . in most cases ,",
    "the observers used a d55 dichroic to separate the blue and red beams of the spectrograph , while on a few nights a mirror was used that directed all of the light to the blue side .",
    "when the 300 or 600 lines mm@xmath7  gratings were used , there was usually a small region of wavelength overlap between the blue and red spectra .",
    "as a result of the heterogeneous nature of the red - side data , this paper focuses primarily on the analysis of the blue - side observations , which were all taken with the same grism and homogeneously observed except for the variations in spectral range described above .    with a single exception ( the night of 2010 august 16 ) , all observations of zw 229 - 015 were obtained with the spectrograph slit at a position angle of pa = 565 .",
    "this angle was chosen so as to place a bright foreground star ( marked with a square in figure [ wmoimage ] ) in the slit , in order to aid in centering the primary target .",
    "a 4  slit width was used for all exposures of zw 229 - 015 and for the standard star bd+284211 .",
    "a 1200  s exposure of zw 229 - 015 and a 60  s exposure of bd+284211 were taken on most nights . on a few nights",
    ", the observers adjusted the exposure time due to weather constraints or took more than one exposure of the agn .",
    "the airmass was smaller than 1.2 for 72% of the spectroscopic observations of zw 229 - 015 , and smaller than 1.5 for all but the final three exposures , when the object was observed at airmasses between 1.5 and 2.0 . at the end of the observing season in december , when the target was observed at relatively high airmass , the fixed slit pa of 565 was within 1020  of the optimal parallactic angle @xcite for the exposures , resulting in minimal differential light losses .",
    "table [ spectable ] also lists the `` image quality , '' measured as the full width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) of the spatial profile of the galactic foreground star in the spectroscopic exposure .",
    "this image quality is primarily a measure of atmospheric seeing , but on some nights poor focus or occasional guiding errors added significantly to the spatial profile width . on clear nights , the blue - side observations typically resulted in a s / n per pixel of @xmath3345 in the extracted spectra at 4700   .",
    "dome - flat exposures and observations of arc - line lamps were taken during each afternoon .",
    "dome flats were usually observed through a 2  slit , since that slit width was used for the observers primary programs .",
    "the difference in slit width between the agn exposures and dome - flat exposures did not have any significant impact on the quality of the blue - side flattening , but on the red side it left strong fringing residuals at wavelengths longer than @xmath34   .",
    "reduction of the kast data followed standard procedures , including overscan subtraction , flat - fielding , unweighted ( nonoptimal ) extractions , and wavelength calibration using the line - lamp exposures .",
    "an extraction width of 65 was used .",
    "flux calibration and a linear shift to the wavelength scale based on the wavelengths of night - sky emission lines were then applied to the spectra .",
    "the final blue - side spectra were binned to a uniform linear scale of 1  pixel@xmath7 .",
    "cosmic - ray residuals were removed from the reduced spectra by interpolation over the affected pixels . for nights",
    "when more than one exposure was taken , the multiple exposures were combined into a single reduced spectrum .",
    "error spectra were also extracted and propagated through the full sequence of reductions .",
    "figure [ zw229spectrum ] illustrates the reduced spectrum from a single observation .",
    "we measured the centroid wavelength of the [ ] @xmath325007 line in each spectrum where the line was available .",
    "the median result is @xmath35   , corresponding to an emission - line redshift of @xmath36 , consistent with the value from @xcite .",
    "the fairly large dispersion in the [ ] wavelength measurements is most likely a result of variations in the centering of the agn in the wide 4  slit in each observation .    in order to intercalibrate the flux scales of the spectra and align them to a consistent wavelength scale",
    ", we employed the scaling procedure described by @xcite , which is based on the assumption that the narrow [ ] emission - line flux is intrinsically constant over the timescale of the monitoring program .",
    "this method applies small wavelength shifts and a multiplicative flux scaling to each spectrum , as well as a convolution with a gaussian broadening kernel , and finds the values of the shift , kernel width , and flux scaling factor that minimize the residual differences between the individual spectrum and a reference spectrum over a small wavelength region containing a narrow emission line and some surrounding continuum . according to @xcite , their scaling method can yield accuracies of 5% or better , but higher accuracy ( @xmath372% ) can be obtained with the best - quality datasets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the flux scale of the reference spectrum was normalized by scaling it to match the mean [ ] @xmath325007 flux measured from eight nights that were considered to be photometric by the observers .",
    "for those eight nights , we find a mean observed [ ] @xmath325007 flux of @xmath38 erg @xmath39  s@xmath7 , with a standard deviation of 4% , as measured from the flux - calibrated spectra prior to applying the scaling procedure .",
    "when applying the @xcite procedure to the individual spectra , we used the [ ] @xmath324959 emission line as the flux scaling reference line , instead of the @xmath325007 line .",
    "the reason for this modification was that 10 of the spectroscopic observations used the blue - side ccd position that cut off the @xmath325007 emission line .",
    "the wavelength range in common to all of the blue - side exposures extended to 5130   , including the @xmath324959 emission line and about 20    redward of the line . by using the @xmath324959 line as the flux reference ,",
    "all of the spectra could be treated identically in the flux scaling procedure .    to examine the accuracy of the spectral scaling",
    ", we measured the flux in the @xmath324959 emission line from each spectrum after the scaling was applied , along with its uncertainty from the propagated error spectrum .",
    "we then determined the normalized excess variance @xmath40 of the @xmath324959 light curve , following the definition used by @xcite : @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the total number of observations , @xmath43 is the mean flux , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the individual flux values and their uncertainties .",
    "we find @xmath46 , indicating that the residual errors in flux scaling contribute a spurious scatter to the light curves at the @xmath47% level .",
    "these residuals are primarily due to seeing variations ( particularly from the worst - seeing nights ) , miscentering of the target in the slit , and night - to - night variations in the telescope and spectrograph focus .",
    "since zw 229 - 015 exhibited dramatic , high - amplitude variability during the monitoring period , this residual scatter only has a small effect on the h@xmath0  light curve .",
    "figure [ figmean ] illustrates the mean and root - mean - square ( rms ) spectra based on the full dataset , constructed after applying the spectral scaling procedure to the data .",
    "the rms spectrum essentially gives the standard deviation of flux values at a given wavelength , and illustrates the relative degree of variability of different wavelength regions of the spectrum .",
    "the broad h@xmath0 , h@xmath4 , and h@xmath5lines clearly stand out in the rms spectrum , and the variable continuum rises strongly toward the blue end of the observed wavelength range .",
    "in addition , a broad @xmath324686 line is evident in the rms spectrum , although it is too weak to be visible in the mean spectrum , where only the narrow component is clearly detected .",
    "the flux scaling of the red - side data is more difficult to establish accurately . on the red side ,",
    "there are no strong and isolated narrow emission lines , so the @xcite scaling routine can not be applied directly . additionally , on some nights the standard star was not observed simultaneously on the blue and red sides , resulting in flux scaling offsets when conditions were not photometric or the seeing was poor . in order to place the red - side data on a flux scale that was approximately consistent with the blue - side data , we first scaled each red spectrum by the scale factor used for the corresponding blue spectrum .",
    "this worked well for most nights , but left obvious offsets between the blue - side and red - side flux scales for a few nights . for those nights",
    ", an additional scaling factor was applied to the red - side data in order to bring the spectrum into agreement with the corresponding blue - side spectrum over the region of wavelength overlap or near - overlap .",
    "( we note that in a dedicated monitoring campaign with homogeneous observations , these flux scaling problems can be mitigated by using a spectrograph setup with substantial wavelength overlap between the red and blue sides , and by observing standard stars simultaneously on both arms of the spectrograph . )",

    "the value of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) for a given lag is computed twice : first by interpolating the shifted continuum light curve to the time steps of the emission - line light curve , and then by interpolating the emission - line light curve to the time steps of the shifted continuum light curve .",
    "the two interpolated versions of the ccf are then averaged together to give the final ccf .",
    "we computed the ccf for lag values ranging from @xmath80 to 30 days , in increments of 0.25 days .",

    "the final cross - correlation results and their uncertainties were determined by following the monte carlo bootstrapping procedure described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in this method ,",
    "a large number of modified realizations of the light curves are created and the cross - correlation function is computed for each realization of a pair of continuum and emission - line light curves .",

    "the @xmath87 uncertainty ranges on @xmath82  and @xmath81  are given by the range of lag values around the median that exclude the highest 15.87% and lowest 15.87% of lag values in the distribution .    when the continuum and emission - line light curves have very similar observational cadences , the two interpolated versions of the ccf are typically very similar in shape .",
    "however , if the two light curves have very different temporal sampling , then the two ccfs can differ substantially .",
    "as described by @xcite , the two interpolated versions of the ccf are usually averaged together to obtain the final result , unless there is a strong reason to prefer one interpolation over the other .",
    "we tested whether this might affect the lag measurements by measuring @xmath81  and @xmath82  separately for the two interpolated versions of the ccf , and comparing them with the results obtained for the averaged ccf .",

    "given this close agreement , we chose to use the averaged ccf for our final results .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the reliability of cross - correlation lag measurements can be improved by subtracting off any long - term secular variations from the light curves that occur on timescales much longer than the reverberation timescale . in practice , this is often accomplished by subtracting a simple linear fit from the light curves .",
    "we found that the measurements of @xmath81  and @xmath82  were virtually unchanged regardless of whether the light curves were linearly detrended , and detrending with a quadratic fit ( in an attempt to remove the long - timescale curvature of the light curves ) only modified the measured lags by less than their @xmath87 uncertainties . for our final measurements , we chose to use the linearly detrended light curves .",
    "we also tested to see whether the cross - correlation measurements would be affected by removal of the last few spectroscopic data points , during the period of poor weather when the sampling was very sporadic , and found that the results for @xmath81  and @xmath82  again were consistent with our final adopted values within the @xmath87 uncertainties .",
    "as described above in  [ photsection ] , the photometric errors listed in table [ phottable ] are likely to underestimate the true uncertainties . to account approximately for additional sources of error , we added 0.01 mag in quadrature to all of the @xmath1-band photometric errors prior to computing the cross - correlations .",
    "we found that this change had only a small effect on the cross - correlation results : the derived value of @xmath82  was either @xmath88 or @xmath89 days using the original photometric errors or the expanded error bars , respectively .",
    "our final measurement of the ccf gives observed - frame h@xmath0  lags of @xmath90 days and @xmath91 days , consistent with the general expectation of a @xmath78 day lag from inspection of the light curves ( as in figure [ lczoom ] ) .",

    "we also measured the h@xmath0  lag relative to the @xmath77-band light curve and found observed - frame lags of @xmath94 and @xmath95 days . within the substantial uncertainties , these results are consistent with the lag measurements carried out against the @xmath1 band .",
    "cross - correlating the @xmath1-band light curve against the @xmath77 continuum , we find values of @xmath81  and @xmath82  that are consistent with zero within their @xmath87 uncertainties , so there is no significant detection of a lag between continuum bands .",
    "higher - cadence observations would be needed in order to search for any cross - band continuum lags ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the nondetection of a lag between the @xmath77 and @xmath1 bands in zw 229 - 015 suggests that either the small blue bump makes only a small contribution to the @xmath77 band , or that the balmer continuum has an extremely short lag time relative to the primary continuum",

    "the two synthetic @xmath1-band measurements differed by only 0.02 mag , indicating that the broad balmer lines make only a very small contribution ( @xmath96 ) to the broad - band @xmath1 magnitude .    to obtain a quantitative estimate of the magnitude of this bias on the lag measurement , we carried out a set of monte carlo simulations .",
    "we simulated a large number ( @xmath86 ) of agn light curves using the method of @xcite , for a power - density spectrum of the form @xmath97 normalized to a continuum rms variability of 20% over a 180-day period .",
    "a simple delta - function transfer function with a lag of 4 days was used to model the emission - line response to the continuum fluctuations .",
    "the `` contaminated '' @xmath1-band light curve was simulated by adding the emission - line light curve to the continuum light curve , weighted so that 2% of the total flux was from the emission - line contribution . with each set of simulated light curves we measured the emission - line lag relative to the uncontaminated continuum light curve , and relative to the continuum light curve with the added emission - line contribution .",
    "the simulations confirm that the bias in the lag measurements is very small for zw  229 - 015 .",
    "when the emission - line contribution to the continuum light curve is at the observed 2% level as in zw 229 - 015 , the simulations show that the measurement of @xmath82  is biased on average by only @xmath98 days ( with an rms scatter of 0.05 days in the bias for the full ensemble of simulations ) , relative to the measurement obtained by cross - correlating against the pure continuum light curve . for zw 229 - 015",
    ", the bias is much smaller than the overall uncertainty in the lag measurement , but it can become significant for higher levels of emission - line contamination .",
    "we carried out additional simulations , and found that if the emission - line contribution to the broad - band light curve increases to 10% , for example , the average bias in the @xmath82  measurement is @xmath99 days ( for the same model parameters described above ) . for future reverberation campaigns that use broad - band photometry to measure the continuum light curves",
    ", it will be important to carry out simulations like these to assess the likely magnitude of this effect on each individual object .",
    "the size of the bias would depend on both the emission - line equivalent width and on the target s redshift , since higher redshifts would move the broad h@xmath0  line closer to the peak transmission of the @xmath1 filter .",

    "* ) , and it is very fortunate that such a nearby and highly variable agn happens to be in the _ kepler _  field of view . while the _ kepler _  light curve for zw 229 - 015 is not yet available , we anticipate that it will enable fundamentally new investigations into the properties of agn optical continuum variability .",
    "there are only a few other low - redshift seyfert galaxies being monitored by _ kepler _ , and although their variability properties are currently unknown , it seems likely that zw 229 - 015 will be the most important object of this small sample .",
    "as such , it is crucial that zw 229 - 015 continue to be monitored by _ kepler _  for the longest possible duration during the mission .",
    "additional observations of zw 229 - 015 can be used to measure the galaxy s bulge properties , to place it on the correlations between black hole mass and bulge luminosity or mass , and to add it to the sample used to calibrate the relationship between blr radius and continuum luminosity following the methods described by @xcite .",
    "similarly , a measurement of the bulge velocity dispersion for zw 229 - 015 can be used to add this galaxy to the @xmath137  relation for reverberation - mapped agns @xcite .",
    "our wide - slit observations are not well suited to carrying out measurements of stellar kinematics , but stellar absorption features including the triplet absorption lines are easily visible in the lick spectra , so it should be straightforward to measure the bulge velocity dispersion with suitable new observations .",
    "other observing programs for zw 229 - 015 are currently in progress , including near - infrared monitoring with _ spitzer _ to measure the dust reverberation timescale .",
    "we will also revisit our h@xmath0  reverberation measurement when the _ kepler_light curve becomes available , since the sampling and precision of the _ kepler _  data may lead to an improved determination of the emission - line lag .    to summarize our conclusions",
    ": we have measured a rest - frame reverberation lag of @xmath162 days for the h@xmath0  line in zw 229 - 015 . combining this result with the broad h@xmath0  line width",
    ", we obtain a virial estimate of @xmath163 @xmath9for the black hole in this galaxy , under the assumption of a virial normalization factor of @xmath142 .",
    "the mass estimate does not change significantly if we adopt the method of @xcite to obtain a mass estimate corrected for the dynamical influence of radiation pressure in the blr .",
    "the _ kepler _  target zw 229 - 015 is destined to be one of the most important agns for investigations of the origin and characteristics of optical continuum variability . as recent observations have begun to reveal connections between optical continuum variability characteristics and black hole masses in agns , this estimate of @xmath144  will be a valuable asset for future interpretation of the _ kepler _  light curve for zw 229 - 015 .",
