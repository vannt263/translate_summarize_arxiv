    "there has been growing interest in the non - extensive statistical mechanics @xcite based on tsallis generalized entropy ( in @xmath5 unit ) : @xmath6    at least formally , tsallis entropy is an extension of conventional boltzmann - shannon ( bs ) entropy with one - real - parameter of @xmath1 . in the limit of @xmath7 , tsallis entropy eq .",
    "( [ sq ] ) reduces to bs entropy , @xmath8 , since @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 may be interpreted as a quantity characterizing the degree of non - extensivity of tsallis entropy through the so - called _ pseudo - additivity _ : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote two statistically independent sub - systems .",
    "it is worth while to realize that the pseudo - additivity of @xmath13 is one of the crucial ingredients of tsallis non - extensive statistical mechanics .",
    "in fact , the uniqueness of tsallis entropic form is proved @xcite for an entropy that fulfills the generalization of the shannon - kinchin axioms @xcite based on the pseudo - additive conditional entropy obeying the pseudo - additivity instead of additivity .",
    "then what is a role of the pseudo - additivity ? by rewriting eq .",
    "( [ sq ] ) as the following form , @xmath14 we see that the pseudo - additivity of tsallis entropy comes from the @xmath1-logarithmic function , which is defined by @xmath15 since it equips the pseudo - additivity as @xmath16    the inverse function of the @xmath1-logarithmic function is @xmath1-exponential one , which is defined by @xmath17^{\\frac{1}{1-q}},\\ ] ] for @xmath18 and otherwise @xmath19 .",
    "as tsallis @xcite has already pointed out , the parameter @xmath1 plays a similar role as the light velocity @xmath20 in special relativity or planck s constant @xmath21 in quantum mechanics in the sense of a one - parameter extension of classical mechanics . unlike @xmath20 or @xmath21 ,",
    "however , @xmath1 does not seem to be a universal constant .",
    "thus it is a natural question whether @xmath1 is merely an adjustable parameter or not in the non - extensive statistical mechanics . in some cases the parameter @xmath1 has no physical meaning , but when it is used as an adjustable parameter the resulting distributions give excellent agreement with experimental data . in other but a few cases @xcite , @xmath1",
    "is uniquely determined by the constraints of the problem and thereby @xmath1 may have a physical meaning .",
    "recent studies of the characterization of mixing in one - dimensional ( 1d ) dissipative maps @xcite and of symbolic sequences @xcite seems to provide a positive answer to the above question since there exists the special value @xmath2 such that @xmath22 becomes linear .",
    "for example , in the studies @xcite of mixing in simple logistic map , @xmath2 can be obtained by three different methods based on : i ) the upper bound of a power - law sensitivity @xmath23 to initial conditions ; ii ) the singularity indices in multi - fractal structure ; and iii ) the rate of information loss in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "the remarkable fact is that all methods lead to the same value of @xmath24 , which may shed some light on the physical meaning of @xmath1 .",
    "they established some connections among the sensitivity @xmath23 to initial conditions , tsallis entropy @xmath0 and the proper entropic index @xmath2 .",
    "in particular we focus on the work of buiatti _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite , in which they have shown , for the symbolic sequences with length of @xmath25 , that the generalized block entropy @xcite is proportional to @xmath25 when the proper entropic index @xmath26 is used . in other words",
    ", there may exist a proper entropic index @xmath26 , which may statistically characterize a non - extensive system .",
    "in this work we study a reason why the generalized block entropy in the work of buiatti _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite is proportional to the length @xmath25 of symbolic sequences when we use the proper entropic index @xmath26 .",
    "in particular we focus our attention on a role of the pseudo - additivity of the conditional entropy in characterizing a non - extensive system with the proper entropic index @xmath2 .",
    "we reformulate the constraint of obtaining the proper entropic index @xmath26 as follows : the pseudo - additive conditional entropy becomes additive with respect to @xmath25 when the proper entropic index @xmath26 is used . in other words , for the special value @xmath2 of entropic index , the additivity of the conditional entropy is held in spite of that the involved subsystems are not statistically independent of each other .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we explain the constraint of obtaining the proper entropic index @xmath2 in the work @xcite of buiatti _",
    "et  al . _ , and propose our constraint of obtaining @xmath2 .",
    "we then show the equivalence of the two constraints and discuss the underlying simple mechanism of why the conditional entropy becomes additive for the proper entropic index @xmath2 under the assumption of equi - probability . in section 3 , we discuss long - range correlation expressed by @xmath1-exponential function .",
    "section 4 is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "buiatti _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite showed , by studying a symbolic binary sequence @xmath27 with a long - range correlation , that for the probability @xmath28 of each path with length of @xmath25 , the generalized block entropy @xcite , @xmath29 is proportional to @xmath25 if and only if the variable index @xmath1 equals the proper entropic index @xmath2 .",
    "we reformulate this constraint as the following .",
    "the pseudo - additive conditional entropy @xcite , which is defined by @xmath30 should satisfy the _ additivity _",
    ", @xmath31 when @xmath1 is equal to the proper entropic index @xmath26 . at first sight",
    "our constraint seems to be paradoxical , since @xmath0 is pseudo - additive in general .",
    "we explain in the followings that the equivalence of the two constraints which determine @xmath2 , and discuss an underlying simple mechanism connecting the variable entropic index @xmath1 with the proper index @xmath2 .",
    "the method of buiatti _",
    "et  al . _",
    "is rephrased as follows : @xmath32 is a linear function of @xmath25 when @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a proportional constant , or equivalently @xmath35    subtracting @xmath36 from the both sides and after a little bit algebra , eq .",
    "( [ linear - sq ] ) is rewritten as @xmath37 dividing the both sides of eq .",
    "( [ linear - sq2 ] ) by @xmath38 and using the definition of the conditional entropy of eq .",
    "( [ cond - ent ] ) , it is obvious that eq .",
    "( [ linear - sq ] ) is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ additive - sq ] ) .",
    "hence we have reformulated the method of buiatti _",
    "_ as follows : the conditional entropy becomes additive when we use the proper entropic index @xmath2 .",
    "having explained the equivalence of buiatti _ et al . _ and our methods of obtaining a proper entropic index @xmath2",
    ", we now consider why the conditional entropy @xmath40 is proportional to the length @xmath25 of symbolic sequences when @xmath3 .    under the assumption of equi - probability , tsallis entropy can be written in terms of the number of states @xmath41 for the symbolic sequences with the length of @xmath25 as @xmath42 then the conditional entropy of eq .",
    "( [ cond - ent ] ) is expressed in terms of @xmath41 as @xmath43    suppose that the number of states @xmath41 obeys a power - law evolution , which can be well described by @xmath44 with the proper @xmath2 of a system of interest , where @xmath45 is another constant . the relation between @xmath45 and @xmath34 of eq .",
    "( [ linear - sq ] ) is discussed in the next section .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ cond - sq ] ) , the corresponding conditional entropy can be written as @xmath46              = \\ln_q [ \\exp_{q^*}(l'_{q^ * } \\ ; n ) ] .\\ ] ] now we readily see that @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath25 , if and only if we set @xmath1 to @xmath2 . in other words , if @xmath47 obeys the @xmath2-exponential evolution of eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) , then it is reasonable to use its inverse function in order to define the conditional entropy .",
    "tsallis entropic description may be well suited for a long - range correlated system which obeys a power - law evolution described by @xmath1-exponential function .",
    "then how can @xmath1-exponential function express long - range correlation ?",
    "we here explain that long - range correlation may be expressed by the non - factorizability of @xmath1-exponential function into independent terms .",
    "the long - range correlation in this case means the initial condition dependency of long duration .",
    "it is known that @xmath1-exponential function can not be resolved into a product of independent terms unless @xmath48 .",
    "for example @xmath49 is not resolved into the independent factors as @xmath50 .",
    "instead it can be expressed as the product of the dependent factors as @xmath51 .",
    "let us focus on the long - range correlation associated with the power - law evolution of @xmath41 described by eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) . using eqs .",
    "( [ lin - sq ] ) and ( [ equi - prob ] ) , the @xmath1-exponential dependency of @xmath52 can be expressed as @xmath53 = \\exp_q [ s_q(1 ) + l_q",

    "\\label{long - range}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath54 appears in all terms and this reflects the initial condition dependency of long duration .",
    "this feature is consistent with the single - trajectory approach by montangero _",
    "_ @xcite in which they fix a given initial condition in order to obtain the @xmath2 of the non - extensive version of kolmogorov - sinai entropy for the dynamics of the logistic map at the chaotic threshold .",
    "because of the initial condition dependency of long duration , an averaging over many different initial conditions is not appropriate",
    ".    now let us focus on the relation between the proportional constants @xmath45 and @xmath34 in the previous section . from the second line of eq .",

    "( [ w ] ) , @xmath45 and @xmath34 are related by @xmath56 which is the same relation @xcite of @xmath57 between the lagrange multiplier @xmath58 of optimal lagrange multipliers ( olm ) method and that @xmath59 of tsallis - mendes - plastino one in canonical ensemble formalism , where @xmath60 denotes partition function .",
