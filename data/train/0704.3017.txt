    "mesoscopic systems consisting of superconductor / semiconductor hybrid structures have attracted considerable attention in recent years.@xcite the carrier transport in superconductor / normal metal or superconductor / semiconductor structures can be described in the framework of andreev reflection.@xcite during an andreev reflection process an electron that travels from the semiconductor on a superconductor / semiconductor interface is retroreflected as a hole . simultaneously , a cooper pair is created on the superconductor side .",
    "a number of interesting phenomena based on andreev reflection had been studied in the past , e.g. gate - control of a josephson supercurrent,@xcite superconducting quantum point contacts,@xcite control of the supercurrent by hot carrier injection,@xcite and supercurrent reversal in a quantum dot.@xcite    a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a semiconductor offers the advantage of ballistic transport in the semiconductor part .",
    "a fascinating regime occurs in high magnetic fields as soon as the transport across the superconductor/2deg is governed by the landau quantization in the 2deg.@xcite microscopic calculations@xcite revealed conductance oscillations in s/2deg junctions as a function of magnetic field .",
    "it was theoretically shown by hoppe _",
    "et al._@xcite that the current flow along the s/2deg interface can be described in the framework of andreev bound states formed by electron and hole edge state excitations . at lower magnetic fields",
    "one can view this process in a semiclassical picture , in which carrier propagation is maintained by skipping orbits of electrons and holes along the interface.@xcite in mesoscopic s/2deg contacts where the phase coherence is maintained during the quasiparticle propagation , the interference between electrons and andreev - reflected holes can lead to the magnetoconductance oscillations which are based on a aharonov  bohm type effect.@xcite the semiclassical theory of the charge transport through the s-2deg interface at large filling factors was developed in refs .  .",
    "apart from the orbital effects , a magnetic field can also be employed to induce zeeman energy splitting in the 2deg .",
    "this opens up the possibility to study spin - related effects in combination with andreev reflection.@xcite    from experimental point of view , it is challenging to fabricate highly transmissive superconducting contacts to a 2deg using superconductors with high critical magnetic fields.@xcite recently , eroms _",

    "the choice of the nbn / au system was motivated by our previous studies , where an au interlayer helped achieving a high s/2deg interface transparency while maintaining a high critical field of the superconductor.@xcite complementary to the work of eroms _ et al._,@xcite we observe a suppression of enhanced oscillations in the magnetoresistance when a dc bias current across the junction exceeds a critical value or the temperature is increased above a critical temperature.@xcite we compare our measurements of the nbn / au/2deg structures to that of similar structures with normal metal electrodes connected to the 2deg .",
    "our interpretation of the experimental findings is based on recent theoretical models describing andreev reflection across a s/2deg interface in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the strained ga@xmath0in@xmath1as / inp heterostructure was grown on a semi - insulating inp substrate by using metal organic vapor phase epitaxy ( movpe ) .",

    "de haas oscillations yielded an effective electron mass @xmath8 , which is in good agreement with previously reported results .",
    "@xcite based on the values given above , a transport mean free path @xmath9 of 3.3  @xmath10 m and a fermi energy @xmath11 of 42  mev were determined .",

    "two cr / au electrodes were used .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    we used a three - step electron beam lithography process to fabricate the samples .",
    "first , the mesa was defined by ch@xmath13/h@xmath14 reactive ion etching using a ti layer as an etching mask .",
    "the etching depth of 170  nm was well below the depth of the ga@xmath2in@xmath3as channel layer .",
    "in the second step the superconducting electrodes ( s ) contacting the 2deg at the mesa sidewalls were defined by electron beam lithography .",
    "we used ar plasma cleaning to remove residual atoms on the surface .",
    "subsequently , a 10 nm thin au interlayer followed by a 100  nm thick nbn layer were deposited _ in - situ _ by dc magnetron sputtering .",
    "after the lift - off the sample was annealed at a temperature of @xmath15c for 10  sec .",
    "the au interlayer and the annealing were introduced to improve the interface transparency.@xcite by the final electron beam lithography step , the normally conductive cr / au electrodes ( n ) ( 5nm/100 nm ) were deposited by electron beam evaporation .",

    "( s/2deg / n ) a superconducting au / nbn electrode and a normal conductive electrode were facing each other , whereas for the second type ( n/2deg / n ) a normal conductive material ( cr / au ) was used for both electrodes .",
    "all measurements were performed in a he-3 cryostat in a two - terminal configuration .",
    "the sample resistance was measured by employing the current - driven lock - in technique with an ac excitation current of 10  na . in order to add an additional dc bias voltage across the sample ,",
    "a dc - current @xmath18 was superimposed for some measurements .",
    "at the magnetic fields investigated ( @xmath19  t ) , the two - terminal measurements showed a positive magnetoresistance with superimposed oscillations in all samples . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we display data obtained for an s/2deg / n structure after subtracting the slowly varying positive magnetoresistance background .     of the s/2deg / n sample for various dc bias currents @xmath18 : 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75  @xmath10a at a temperature of 0.5  k. the oscillation amplitude was extracted for fig .  3 at the magnetic field value of 0.51  t indicated by a circle .",

    "[ fig2 ] ]    at low dc bias currents the s/2deg / n structure reveals clear resistance oscillations as a function of magnetic field .",

    "@xmath10a the amplitude of the magnetoresistance oscillations @xmath25 decreases monotonously with increasing bias current , comprising a sharp drop for dc currents exceeding 0.5  @xmath10a . at currents",
    "@xmath26  @xmath10a , the amplitude of the resistance oscillations shows only a very weak bias current dependence . in strong contrast , in the n/2deg / n reference structures , the magnetoresistance oscillation amplitude depends only weakly on the dc bias current in the whole range from zero up to 2  @xmath10a , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] , at low temperatures the differential resistance @xmath23 of s/2deg / n sample , normalized to the resistance @xmath27 at 1.5  @xmath10a , shows a decrease within the range of dc bias currents of @xmath28  @xmath10a .",
    "in order to consider the contribution of the s/2deg interface only , we subtracted the resistance of the 2deg / n interface deduced from the n/2deg / n reference structure .",
    "our previous measurements of s/2deg single junctions prepared in the same processing run revealed that the decrease in the differential resistance is related to the superconducting energy gap.@xcite this suggests that the enhanced magnetoresistance oscillations detected at low dc bias currents are most likely due to the andreev - reflection contribution to the interface conductance .",
    "the decrease of the differential resistance at low dc bias currents indicates that the barrier at the s/2deg is relatively low .",
    "a transmission coefficient @xmath29 was estimated from the ratio of the resistances at zero bias and large bias currents , following the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk model.@xcite the high transmission probability results from the au layer introduced between the nbn layer and the 2deg.@xcite the finite interface barrier can be attributed partly to the fermi velocity mismatch between the metallic layer and the 2deg and partly to contamination at the interface .",
    "the specific shape of the @xmath30 characteristics can be associated with the presence of the au interlayer . due to the proximity effect between the superconducting nbn layer and the au layer ,",
    "a gap in the density of states is induced in the normal conducting au film resulting in the maxima in the differential resistance @xmath23 observed at approximately @xmath31a.@xcite    figure  [ fig4 ] shows magnetoresistance oscillations of the s/2deg / n structure at different temperatures in the 0.53  k range .",
    "the data are taken at zero dc bias current after subtracting the background resistance .",
    "the oscillation amplitudes are found to decrease with increasing temperature .",
    "our experiments indicate that the magnetoresistance oscillations are very sensitive to temperature . with the assumption that the conventional effective mass approach is applicable,@xcite we attempted to determine the effective mass from the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude .",
    "however , in consistence with the results of eroms _ _ et al.__@xcite the fit was poor .",
    "below we will show that the experimental temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitudes can be explained within the model of the phase - coherent transport of electrons and andreev reflected holes in s/2deg junctions in a ballistic regime .",
    "@xcite     of the s/2deg / n sample at @xmath32 for various temperatures : 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0  k. [ fig4 ] ]    the magnetoconductance of superconductor/2deg junctions in high magnetic fields was theoretically studied in refs .  .",
    "in refs .   it has been shown that the magnetoconductance oscillations appear in the high - field regime in a ballistic junction when the andreev reflection is not perfect at the interface and the diameter of the cyclotron motion of quasiparticles is smaller than the width of the junction .",
    "the mechanism of the novel magnetoconductance oscillations has been revealed in refs .",
    ", based on the phenomenology of the aharonov  bohm type interference effect , and can be explained using a semiclassical description of a charge transport in the s/2deg junction .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ]  ( inset ) illustrates a semiclassical picture for andreev reflection process at a finite magnetic field .     as a function of temperature at @xmath33  t ( squares ) . here",
    ", @xmath34 is the amplitude at @xmath35  k. solid line represents the calculated amplitude according to ref .  .",
    "the inset shows a schematics of the andreev reflection process at s/2deg interface with a magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the plane of the 2deg .",
    "the electrons and holes acquire a phase shift @xmath36 and @xmath37 between two successive andreev reflections .",
    "the quantities , @xmath38 and @xmath17 denote the cyclotron radius and the length of the s/2deg interface , respectively .",
    "[ fig5 ] ]    in case of a barrier at the s/2deg interface , an electron impinging at the interface is reflected to a certain probability as an electron or as a hole .",
    "the magnetic field forces the quasiparticles to circular motion . due to the opposite effective mass and the inverse charge",
    ", the electron and hole orbits do have the same chirality , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  ( inset ) .",
    "thus , both quasiparticles propagate in the same direction along the interface . depending on whether an electron or a hole is andreev reflected at the interface , a cooper pair is formed or removed from the superconductor , respectively , resulting in a net current across the s / deg interface .",
    "the electron ( hole ) wave acquires a phase shift @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) on the path between two scattering processes at the interface , due to the magnetic field , during the circular motion in the 2deg .",
    "it has been shown that the phase difference between the pair of the waves @xmath39 is independent on the incident angle of the electron and proportional to the magnetic flux encircled by the single complete cyclotron orbit.@xcite this results in the aharonov ",
    "bohm type interference of quasiparticles at the interface.@xcite as a consequence , the zero - bias conductance oscillates as a function of magnetic flux encircled by the cyclotron orbit in units of @xmath40 .",
    "the magnetoconductance oscillations are periodic as a function of the inverse magnetic field.@xcite in order to establish periodic oscillations , the length @xmath17 of the s/2deg interface must be larger than the cyclotron diameter @xmath41 and smaller than the transport mean free path @xmath9 .",
    "this ensures that the quasiparticles impinge at the interface at least twice , in order to allow for interference . in our case ,",
    "the largest possible cyclotron diameter is 880  nm corresponding to the lowest magnetic field of 0.3  t considered here .",
    "in addition , the length of the s/2deg interface @xmath17 is smaller than @xmath9 . thus , both conditions are fulfilled .",
    "note that the theoretical analysis @xcite presented above is not valid at very high magnetic fields when the filling factors @xmath20 are in the order of unity . in this case",
    "the electron and hole propagation can be described in terms of andreev edge states.@xcite similar to the results reported in refs .",
    ", analytical calculations within the edge channels picture showed the pronounced magnetoconductance oscillations periodic in @xmath42 for the case of a finite barrier at the interface or a mismatch of the fermi velocity.@xcite the amplitude of the magnetoconductance oscillations as a function of the dc bias voltage was studied numerically in refs .  .",
    "it has been shown that the pronounced magnetoconductance oscillations can also be seen at the finite bias voltage @xmath43 .",
    "the oscillations are suppressed at @xmath44 , since the amplitude of the andreev reflection is significantly reduced for @xmath45 .",
    "in accordance to the theoretical predictions cited above , we found pronounced oscillations in the magnetoresistance of the s/2deg / n structure .",
    "however , a similar oscillation period in @xmath42 ( shubnikov - de haas oscillations ) is expected for the magnetoresistance of the 2deg as well .",
    "we therefore have to make sure that the enhancement of oscillations observed in our experiment can indeed be attributed to andreev refection at the s/2deg interface .",
    "the first evidence is that a considerably larger oscillation amplitude is found for the s/2deg / n sample compared to the n/2deg / n structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . an enhanced oscillation amplitude for the magnetoresistance of a s / deg structure at bias voltages",
    "@xmath46 less than @xmath47 was theoretically predicted in case of a finite interface barrier .  @xcite as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the large - amplitude oscillations are preserved up to dc bias currents @xmath48  @xmath10a . at bias",
    "current @xmath18 above this value the bias voltage @xmath46 exceeds the voltage @xmath47 related to the superconducting gap energy @xmath49 , as indicated by the measurement of the differential resistance .",
    "a similar behavior was found in the calculations by asano _",
    "et al._@xcite and takagaki.@xcite there , an abrupt decrease of the oscillation amplitude was observed at @xmath45 .",
    "the experimentally observed dependence of the oscillation on the bias current is in strong contrast to the findings regarding the n/2deg / n structure , where the oscillation amplitude remains constant for the entire range of @xmath18 .",
    "our interpretation is supported further by the measurements of the magnetoresistance as a function of temperature . here , a strong decrease of the oscillation amplitude with increasing temperature was observed at temperatures below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath50 in our samples . based on the semiclassical model for the current transport in a ballistic s/2deg junction ,",
    "@xcite we have estimated the temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance oscillation amplitudes . in the calculations ,",
    "the normal and andreev reflection coefficients are approximated by the btk model.@xcite the superconducting energy gap @xmath51 in the superconductor is assumed to follow the bcs temperature dependence .",
    "@xcite the differential conductance at zero bias @xmath52 is evaluated by integration over energy of the spectral conductance@xcite multiplied by the energy derivative of the fermi distribution function . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the results of our calculations of the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude . in the simulations , for the semiconductor region we used parameters characteristic of our ingaas / inp heterostructures .",
    "the interface barrier - strength parameter @xmath53 was estimated from the experimental data , and the superconducting energy gap parameter @xmath49 was chosen to adjust the experimental temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude .",
    "the calculated results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data for values of the @xmath49 parameter close to the superconducting energy gap in the sample measured by the differential resistance versus bias voltage characteristics .",
    "thus , the model of the phase - coherent transport of carriers at the s/2deg interface in strong magnetic fields @xcite appeared to be consistent with our experimental data . in ref .",
    "we have analyzed finite temperature zero - field current - voltage characteristics of nbn / au / gainas - inp junctions within a model based on the quasiclassical green - function approach.@xcite at present , however , the theoretical description of the conductance oscillations at an s/2deg interface in a magnetic field based on this approach has not yet been developed .",
    "a similar temperature behavior of the magnetoresistance was found by eroms _ et al._@xcite they attributed the enhanced oscillation amplitude to the higher backscattering contribution in the 2deg due to the combined occupation of the edge channels by electrons and holes in case of andreev reflection at the interface .",
    "giazotto _ _ et al.__@xcite studied theoretically the effect of zeeman splitting on the andreev reflection at the superconductor/2deg interface .",
    "it is predicted that the effect of zeeman splitting should be visible as a double - step feature in the conductance of transparent s/2deg interface .",
    "however , at magnetic fields investigated here these corrections are small and thus the effect of the zeeman splitting could not be resolved in our experiments .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the magnetotransport in s/2deg / n structures at various dc bias currents and temperatures .",
    "we have found that the amplitude of oscillations of the magnetoresistance is considerably enhanced at low bias currents .",
    "the observed behavior is interpreted using the framework of phase - coherent andreev reflection in the presence of a magnetic field .",
