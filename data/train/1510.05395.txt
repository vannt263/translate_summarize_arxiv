    "the dependence of dust extinction on wavelength is described by the so - called extinction curve . in most regions of the milky way",
    ", the extinction curve rises like a power law from infrared ( ir ) to optical wavelengths , then shows a prominent bump at 0.2175@xmath3 , and may steeply rise in the far ultraviolet ( uv ) ( figure 1 ) .",
    "possible contributors to the uv bump are interstellar graphite grains ( mathis et al .  1977 ) , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules ( draine 1989 ) molecules , or mgo particles with a thin o@xmath4 coating ( maclean et al .  1982 ) .    a typical way to determine the interstellar extinction is the standard `` pair method '' , which matches the spectral features of reddened main - sequence ( ms ) stars with identical unreddened ms standard stars ( massa et al .  1983 )",
    "the extinction is derived for each star in terms of @xmath5 or @xmath6 as a function of inverse wavelength ( cardelli et al . 1988 , 1989 ; fitzpatrick 1999 ) .",
    "recently fitzpatrick & massa ( 2005 ) introduced a new technique that derives the interstellar extinction curve from the uv to the ir by modeling the observed spectral energy distribution of reddened early - type stars .",
    "the galactic extinction curve has been extensively studied in a large number of papers ( e.g. , seaton 1979 ; savage et al .",
    "1985 ; cardelli et al .  1989 , 1988 ; fitzpatrick 1999 ;",
    "valencic et al .",
    "2004 ; fitzpatrick & massa 2007 , 2009 ) , which have shown it to vary considerably among different lines of sight .",
    "the individual extinction curves obtained for various lines of sight are averaged to obtain the mean galactic extinction curve , which has an average total to selective extinction ratio of @xmath7 , and whose dependence on wavelength is parameterized with analytical functions .",
    "while the extinction curve at optical wavelengths does not seem to change much among different lines of sight , large variations exist in the uv range ( massa et al .",
    "1983 ; fitzpatrick 1999 ) .",
    "the large rms dispersion associated with the different average galactic extinction curves makes them almost indistinguishable from each other ( seaton 1979 ; savage et al .",
    "1985 ; cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ; fitzpatrick 1999 ; valencic et al .  2004",
    "; fitzpatrick & massa 2007 ) .",
    "we should bear in mind that any mean extinction curve is biased by the sample of lines of sight from which it was derived , i.e. , different lines of sight probe different conditions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "however , the mean galactic extinction curve does not work for other galaxies , especially not for starburst galaxies , where the star formation rate is a few tens of @xmath8 , and the total to selective extinction ratio @xmath9 is much larger ( @xmath10 ; calzetti et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 , 2000 ) than in the diffuse galactic ism ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the extinction curve of starburst galaxies is grey and lacks a bump at 0.2175@xmath3 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath9 is usually treated as an indicator for the grain size ( cardelli et al .",
    "the higher than normal value of @xmath9 and the absence of a uv bump may imply different processing histories of dust grains in the ism of starburst galaxies , which favor formation of large grains .    according to calzetti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , young massive stars are associated with dustier regions than the older and less massive stars . the large optical depth associated with young massive stars preserves the large dust grains , which absorb less uv light than smaller grains and thus may explain the absence of the uv bump in the extinction curve of starburst regions / galaxies ( pierini et al.2005 ; panuzzo et al .  2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , the strong uv radiation and stellar winds of massive stars are likely to destroy dust grains and change the properties of the local ism .",
    "the stellar feedback from young massive stars produces an inhomogeneous , clumpy distribution of dust within star - forming regions , which can not be represented with the uniform dust screen model commonly used for the milky way .",
    "a clumpy distribution of dust is effective in redirecting the scattered photons along the line of sight ( calzetti et al .",
    "in contrast , in the diffuse galactic ism the distant dust forms a uniform foreground extinction screen , through which absorption and the scattering remove flux from the line of sight .",
    "therefore the extinction curve of starburst galaxies is greyer than the average galactic extinction curve .",
    "unfortunately , most of the starburst galaxies are too distant to study their ism with high angular resolution data . however , in the milky way , the environment of an hii region hosting a massive young cluster may resemble that of starburst galaxies .",
    "a systematic investigation of the reddened stars within an hii region can probe the effect of the presence of massive stars on dust grains , and extend our knowledge of the ism in starburst regions from parsec to kiloparsec scales .",
    "there is an ideally suited galactic hii region hosting a starburst cluster of which high - resolution and multi - band data are available .",
    "this is ngc3603 , a giant hii region containing the central ionizing cluster hd97950 with a mass of @xmath11 ( harayama et al .",
    "2008 ) . a larger than normal total to selective extinction @xmath12 was found among stars in ngc3603 that are brighter than @xmath13mag and located at distances larger than 0.5pc from the hd97950 cluster ( pandey et al .",
    "sung & bessell ( 2004 ) derived a smaller @xmath14 value , @xmath15 , from stars with @xmath16mag that are located at projected cluster - centric radii of @xmath17pc .",
    "values of @xmath14 larger than 3.1 were also found in a number of other young galactic star clusters in hii regions , e.g. , ngc6530 ( fernandes et al .",
    "2012 ) ; m16 , m17 , and ngc6357 ( chini & krgel 1983 ; chini & wargau 1990 ) . a larger value of @xmath14 can be due to significant changes in dust properties , such as evaporation of small grains by the radiation of hot stars ( draine 2009 ) and growth of large grains ( cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ; hirashita 2012 ) .",
    "the strong radiation field of the ob stars in the hd97950 cluster ( drissen et al .",
    "1995 ; melena et al .",
    "2008 ) ionizes and sweeps away the ism , and generates a cavity around the cluster where the gas reddening is the lowest ( pang et al .",
    "a shell structure was found at 1.2pc west of the cluster ( figure 2 , clayton 1986 ; pang et al .",
    "2011 ) , which expands with a velocity of 55@xmath18 .",
    "the engine of the expanding shell may be the stellar winds and the radiation pressure of the massive stars in the cluster . such energy input into the ism can change the dust grain properties significantly .",
    "weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) found that when grains larger than @xmath19 are exposed to the radiation of ob stars , they are subjected to the photodesorption force , applied by a radiation field that is anisotropic because of a spatially uneven distribution of stars . under this force ,",
    "the large grains decouple from the gas and move away .",
    "furthermore , the large grains may be destroyed or reduced to 75% of their initial radius by a shock speed as low as 40@xmath20 , which can be generated by supernovae ( seab & shull 1983 ) or by the radiation pressure and the stellar winds of ob stars in a cluster .",
    "the large grains are destroyed or sputter into small grains and are pushed away .",
    "this agrees with the observation of lebouteiller et al .",
    "( 2007 ) that the emission of very small grains whose size is smaller than @xmath21 ( wood et al . 2008 )",
    "increases from the cluster center outwards and peaks at cluster - centric distances of 1  1.5pc .",
    "spectroscopy is only available for 26 early - type stars in ngc3603 ( moffat 1983 ; drissen et al .",
    "1995 ; melena et al .",
    "2008 ) . using @xmath22 photometry , pandey et al .",
    "( 2000 ) derived stellar reddenings and extinctions for 51 probable member stars , whose memberships were inferred via photometric methods and which are mainly located in the outskirts of the cluster hd97950 in ngc3603 . sung & bessell ( 2004 ) extended the number of stars with stellar reddening @xmath23 in ngc3603 to a few hundreds .",
    "no membership probability estimation is available for these stars .    in our work , we obtain reddenings and extinctions for about a hundred ms member stars in hd97950 . the membership of these stars was determined via relative proper motions in pang et al.(2013 ) .",
    "we also derive the average extinction curve from uv to optical wavelengths for the member stars within the hd97950 cluster , and compare it to the extinction laws in the milky way and in starburst galaxies .",

    "finally , we summarize our results in section 6 .",
    "the hd97950 cluster and its immediate surroundings in ngc3603 were observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the uv data were taken with the high resolution channel ( hrc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in 2005 ( go 10602 , pi : jess maz apellniz ) through the _ f220w _ , _ f250w _ , _ f330w _ , and _",

    "filter covers the uv bump in the extinction curve , which can effectively distinguish a normal from a grey extinction curve .",
    "pang et al .  (",

    "of these member stars , 142 are in common between the hrc and pc images and thus have uv and optical photometry available ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the acs / hrc data were reduced using _ dolphot _ ( dolphin 2005 ) , a stellar photometry package that was adapted from _ hstphot _ ( dolphin 2000 ) to handle acs images .",

    "10s in the _ f330w _ and 2s in the _ f435w _ filter .",
    "we masked bad and saturated pixels in the `` flt '' images with the routine acsmask .",

    "dolphot_. a detailed description of the data reduction of the optical wfpc2 data is provided in pang et al .",
    "it is crucial to know which stars are cluster members in order to estimate the reddening of a given star cluster ( e.g. , yadav & sagar 2001 ) . among the hd97950 cluster member stars determined from relative proper motions ( pang et al .",
    "2013 , table 2 ) , there are five ms stars located in the cluster with projected distances of @xmath30pc from the center , for which there are also spectral types available from table 3 of melena et al .",
    "we indicate the locations of these five stars ( red circles ) in the cluster in figure 2 .",
    "the photometry of these five ms stars is presented in table 2 .    in order to obtain the reddening of these five stars , we derive their intrinsic colors from an empirical zero age main sequence ( zams ) according to their spectral types .",
    "the ms stars within the hd97950 cluster were found to be consistent with a single burst population with an age of 1 myr ( e.g. , kudryavtseva et al .",
    "2012 ; pang et al .",
    "hence a zams provides a good approximation of their properties in color - magnitude space .",
    "we use the empirical zams from sparke & gallagher ( s&g , 2007 , their table 1.4 ) , which is based on a large number of nearby ms stars with reliably determined photometry , distances , and well - defined spectral types .",
    "the s&g zams only provides _ ubv _",
    "photometry in the johnson filter system .    on the other hand , the marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) theoretical isochrones provide magnitudes not only in the standard johnson filter system , but also in the acs / hrc and wfpc2 systems , which are appropriate for the present data sets .",
    "these isochrones extend to 90m@xmath31 , which is massive enough to cover the most massive member stars used in this paper .",
    "hence we derive the corresponding _ f220w _ , _ f250w _ , _ f330w _ , _ f435w _ , _ f555w _ , _ f675w _ , and _ f814w _",

    "this is easily doable since the marigo et al.isochrones of a given age and metallicity use exactly the same luminosity , temperature , and mass steps for each photometric system .",
    "we can now plot two - color diagrams corresponding to the traditional _ ubv _ two - color diagram , and obtain the appropriate reddening values for our five stars ( figure 3 ) by subtracting the intrinsic colors ( blue points ) from the observed colors ( red points ) .",
    "repeating this procedure for different color combinations allows us to calculate the color excesses @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , and the extinctions @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 by comparing the intrinsic colors and magnitudes obtained from the zams using the observed apparent magnitudes and a distance modulus of 14.2mag from sung & bessell ( 2004 ) .",
    "the ( _ f555w_-_f814w _ ) vs.  _ f555w _ color - magnitude diagram ( figure 4 ) shows the member stars of the hd 97950 cluster based on the membership determinations by pang et al .",
    "black dots denote stars detected both in the optical and in the uv data .",
    "open circles show those stars with optical detections only .",
    "member stars with uv and optical photometry delineate the massive ms of the hd 97950 cluster .",
    "the fainter stars with optical detections only are either ms stars or pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars .",
    "note the wide `` turn - on '' transition region where pms stars are moving towards the ms in the color range ( _ f555w_-_f814w_)=@xmath45mag . ms stars located in this overall region are contaminated with pms stars .",
    "some of the brightest pms stars are also detected in our uv data ( and accordingly are marked with black dots ) . since our procedure",
    "to compute individual reddening values relies on ms stars , we exclude pms stars from our analysis .",
    "moreover , calculating reddenings for pms stars is fraught with uncertainties due to the unknown effects caused by their circumstellar disk or dust shell absorbing the uv radiation , the inclination of such disks , accretion , etc ( baraffe et al . 2009 ) .    in order to obtain a clean sample of ms stars",
    ", we consider only stars bluer than ( _ f555w_-_f814w_)=1.8mag to be ms stars .",
    "the lowest stellar mass of these objects corresponds to @xmath46 .",
    "altogether , we select 111 ms member stars to study the reddening and extinction curve within the cluster .",
    "we use the mean reddening vector @xmath47 ( the error is the standard deviation ) of the five ms stars selected from melena et al .",

    "the uncertainty of the color excess comes from the uncertainty in the reddening vector and the photometry .",
    "the reddening vector contributes @xmath48mag uncertainty to the value of @xmath34 , @xmath49mag to @xmath35 .",
    "the individual color excesses and extinctions of the member ms stars are listed in table 3 .",
    "table 4 presents the corresponding mean values for the whole sample .    within the limitations of our photometry",
    ", we can not estimate the amount of multiplicity among the member stars .",
    "however , the optical color of a star hotter than b7 ( @xmath50 ) will not be significantly affected by an equal - mass or less massive companion .",
    "the mean reddening inside the cluster , @xmath0mag ( table 4 ) , agrees well with the result of sung & bessell ( 2004 , @xmath51mag for stars within 0.7pc from the center ) , who derived the reddening by zams fitting to the cmd .",
    "we plot the @xmath35 of the member ms stars as a function of their cluster - centric distances in panel a of figure 6 .",
    "the error bars indicate the uncertainty of the @xmath35 values .",
    "there is an apparent trend of increasing @xmath35 values ( red dots ) with cluster - centric radius , implying that differential reddening even exists within the cluster ( of @xmath52pc ) , just as was found earlier by sung & bessell ( 2004 ; figure 5 in their paper ) .",
    "the mean ratio of total to selective extinction inside the cluster is @xmath53 ( see table 4 ) computed from the extinction @xmath42 and the color excess @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath54 value of majority of the cluster member stars exceeds 3.1 ( table 3 , see figure 7 ) .",
    "we adopt the @xmath23 value of 1.1mag obtained by pandey et al.(2000 ) as an upper limit for the foreground reddening towards the hd97950 cluster .",
    "after we correct for foreground reddening ( assuming fitzpatrick 1999 with @xmath14=3.1 ) , the mean @xmath54 increases to @xmath1 . in section 5.3 , we have shown that the spectral type uncertainty in our selected five ms member stars ( see table 2 ) does not significantly affect the final @xmath14 value .    to investigate the spatial dependence of dust properties in hd97950 , we plot @xmath54 and @xmath42 as a function of cluster - centric distance in panels b and c of figure 6 , both of which show significant scatter .",
    "we computed the average values of @xmath54 and @xmath42 within concentric annuli , respectively , with an initial radius of 0.1pc increasing to 0.5pc in steps of 0.1pc .",
    "the mean values are plotted as red dots in panels b and c of figure 6 .",
    "the mean @xmath54 and @xmath42 values remain roughly constant within the uncertainties , showing a possible slight increase in the outermost annulus .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , is larger in the innermost region of the cluster than in the outer part ( panel c ) .",
    "the large variation of @xmath42 and @xmath54 inside the cluster may imply that the column density of dust within the cluster hd97950 and possibly the size of dust grains vary along different lines of sight , resulting in a clumpy dust distribution across the cluster",
    ". this could be the result of stellar feedback from massive stars , which is destroying dust grains and modifying their distribution .",
    "a high value of @xmath14 ( @xmath56 ) likely indicates that the size of dust grains in the hd97950 cluster is larger than the mean grain size in the diffuse ism .",
    "the growth of dust grains , which may have occurred via accretion or coagulation ( hirashita 2012 ) , took place in the parental molecular cloud of the cluster , where the dust grains can accrete mantles of molecules ( e.g. , ice ) or elements ( e.g. , c , n , and o ) from the gas phase ( cardelli et al .",
    "accretion of volatile ice mantles on the grains increases the sticking coefficients in grain - grain collisions ( ossenkopf 1993 ) , hence enhancing the chance of coagulation , i.e. , the adherence of dust particles driven by their mutual interaction .",
    "though a higher cloud density promotes coagulation ( tielens 1989 ) , the latter depends also on the particles collision velocity , which is a function of mass , elastic properties , and surface energy of the dust material ( ossenkopf 1993 ) .",
    "cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) computed the integrated extinction cross sections in several dense galactic regions ( @xmath57 ) , and found that their extinction cross section is smaller than that of the diffuse ism . since accretion increases the total extinction cross section while coagulation either increases or decreases it , they suggested that the size growth of grains is dominated by coagulation , which is confirmed by a recent study of campeggio et al .",

    "we plot in figure 11 the individual extinction curves of the five ms spectroscopic member stars , from whose spectral types we could derive independent color excesses and absolute extinctions .",

    "the typical feature of these extinction laws is the existence of the bump at 0.2175@xmath71 for all @xmath14 values .    as shown in figure 11 , the extinction curves of these five stars with known spectral types appear greyer than the extinction law of fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) for the observed @xmath14 values ( 2.06.0 ) , and greyer than cardelli et al.s ( 1989 ) law when calculated with the stars @xmath14 values .",
