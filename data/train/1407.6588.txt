    "one of the great mysteries of particle physics and cosmology is the so - called nonbaryonic dark matter ( dm ) which occupies about @xmath9 % of the energy density of the present universe @xcite .",
    "dm particle should be very long - lived or absolutely stable , and interact with photon or gluon very weakly ( i.e. at least no renormalizable interaction ) , but otherwise its properties are largely unknown .",
    "the simplest dm model is the real scalar dm model described by the lagrangian  : @xmath10 with @xmath1 symmetry ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this model has been studied extensively in literature , and could be considered as a canonical model for non - supersymmetric dm .",

    "( 1 ) is not usually specified whether it is global or local .",
    "if it were global , it may be broken by gravity effects , described by higher dimensional nonrenormalizable operators such as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is any dim-4 operator in the standard model ( sm ) such as @xmath14 or yukawa interactions , etc .",
    "such dim-5 operators will make the scalar dm @xmath15 decay immediately unless its mass is very light @xmath16 kev if we assume @xmath17  @xcite",
    ". therefore global @xmath1 would not be enough to stabilize or make the weak scale dm @xmath15 long - lived enough",
    ". therefore it would be better to use local @xmath1 symmetry to stabilize weak scale dm  @xcite .",
    "this new local gauge symmetry has another nice feature that dm also has its own gauge interaction just as all the sm particles do feel some gauge interactions , with a possibility of strong self interaction for light dark gauge bosons and/or dark higgs  @xcite .",
    "dark gauge symmetry can be realized naturally in superstring theory , for example , where the original gauge group with a huge rank is broken into @xmath18 .    in this letter",

    "presumed local dark gauge symmetry , the phenomenology of dark matter is expected to be distinctly different from the usual @xmath1 scalar dm model described by eq .",
    "let us assume the dark sector has a local @xmath2 gauge symmetry with scalar dark matter @xmath20 and dark higgs @xmath4 with @xmath2 charges equal to @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the local @xmath2 is spontaneously broken into a local @xmath1 subgroup by nonzero vev of @xmath4 , @xmath22 .",
    "then the model lagrangian which is invariant under local dark gauge symmetry is given by    @xmath23    we assume all @xmath24 s and @xmath25 are positive , and the covariant derivative associated with the gauge field @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the strength of @xmath2 gauge interaction .",
    "we have kept renormalizable operators only , assuming the effects from nonrenormalizable operators are negligibly small .",
    "once the @xmath2 symmetry is broken by nonzero vev of @xmath4 , we can replace @xmath29 .",
    "then the @xmath30term becomes @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and generates the mass splitting between @xmath5 and @xmath0 , breaking @xmath2 into @xmath1 under which @xmath33 are odd and all the other fields are even .",
    "note that the local @xmath1 symmetry guarantees the stability of the dark matter even if we consider planck - scale - suppressed nonrenormalizable operators .",
    "the local @xmath1 symmetry requires extra new fields ( dark higgs @xmath4 and dark photon @xmath34 ( that mainly comes from @xmath26 ) , as well as an excited partner of dm , @xmath5 ) , compared with a singlet scalar dark matter model with an unbroken global @xmath1 symmetry described by eq .",
    "these three new fields play important roles in dm phenomenology , phenomenological results of which are qualitatively different from those in the usual @xmath1 scalar dm model . in particular , if we replace the dark higgs field @xmath4 by its vev and ignore the dark higgs degree of freedom , our model becomes exactly the same as the excited scalar dm model which was discussed in the context of 511 kev gamma ray and pamela positron excess  @xcite .",
    "the main difference of our model from the usual excited scalar dm model is the presence of dark higgs field , which is dynamical and would change dm phenomenology completely .",
    "for example , the annihilation of dm for a right amount of thermal relic density can be dominated by @xmath35 and not by @xmath36 , unlike the usual excited dm models .",

    "<S> we present a scalar dark matter ( dm ) model where dm ( @xmath0 ) is stabilized by a local @xmath1 symmetry originating from a spontaneously broken local dark @xmath2 . compared with the usual scalar dm with a global @xmath1 symmetry , the local @xmath1 model possesses three new extra fields , dark photon @xmath3 , dark higgs @xmath4 and the excited partner of scalar dm ( @xmath5 ) , with the kinetic mixing and higgs portal interactions dictated by local dark gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting model can accommodate thermal relic density of scalar dm without conflict with the invisible higgs branching ratio and the bounds from dm direct detections , thanks to the newly opened channels , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , due to the new particles , the @xmath7 scale @xmath8-ray excess from the galactic center ( gc ) can be originated from the decay of dark higgs boson which is produced in dm annihilations . </S>"
