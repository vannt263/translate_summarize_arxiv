    "in this paper we study the second order hamiltonian system @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a periodic potential with minimal period @xmath3 .",
    "there are two question that we study in this paper .",
    "first , we study the existence of periodic solutions of ( [ equation1 ] ) in any connected component of the space of periodic trajectories , i.e in the space of trajectories that makes @xmath10 windings in @xmath5 in @xmath11 time with @xmath10 and @xmath12 arbitrary integers that are coprime .    second , called @xmath13 the frequency of windings of @xmath14 in @xmath5 , we study the existence of orbits with the same @xmath6 that are not @xmath11 periodic , i.e periodic orbits that make @xmath15 windings in @xmath16 time @xmath17 , with @xmath10 and @xmath12 coprime , when the solutions are not @xmath11 periodic .",
    "the problem of the search of periodic orbits is classical and a standard approach to these problems is that of studying the critical points of the action functional @xmath18 in the space of functions that makes @xmath10 windings in @xmath11 time .",
    "this method have been largely used by many people in the last twenty years : see e.g. the book of rabinowitz @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the problem of the search of periodic orbits with a given frequency of windings in @xmath5 is closely related to that of the existence of subharmonic orbits .",
    "in particular , for what concern the existence of subharmonic orbits , we quote @xcite for a general hamiltonian system on @xmath19 under non - degeneracy condictions , @xcite for the existence of infinitely many subharmonics for more general lagrangian systems and @xcite for the case of a second order differential equation in @xmath20 with a time dependent periodic potential and a periodic forcing term with zero mean value",
    ".    in his paper , the existence of periodic orbits of equation ( [ equation1 ] ) has been studied by means of the morse relations applied to the action functional .",
    "we will show that the morse relations allows to prove the existence of infinitely many orbits with a given @xmath21 and to give a lower bound on the number of periodic orbits with a given period .",
    "we set @xmath22:x \\in c^2 ( { \\mathbb r } , { \\mathbb r}),\\ x(t+k_2 t_0)=x(t)+k_1\\};\\ ] ] where @xmath23=x   \\mod   1 $ ] ; namely @xmath24 is the space of the periodic @xmath25-functions which make @xmath10 windings in @xmath11 time ; thus we have that @xmath26 .",
    "given a periodic orbit , @xmath14 , the rotation frequency @xmath27 associated to @xmath14 can be defined as the frequency of windings of the periodic orbit in @xmath5 , i.e. the number of windings divided by @xmath11 .",
    "given @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the periodic orbit that makes @xmath10 windings in @xmath11 time has a rotation frequency @xmath21 .",
    "clearly , the set of periodic functions with rotation frequency @xmath21 when @xmath10 and @xmath12 are coprime is given by @xmath30 .    a periodic solution @xmath14 of rotation frequency @xmath21 with @xmath10 and @xmath12 coprime",
    "is called a _ fundamental solution _ if @xmath31 . otherwise , if @xmath32 , it is called _ non - fundamental_.    a periodic solution @xmath14 is called _ non - resonant _ if the linearized equation @xmath33 has no periodic solution ( different from 0 ) ; the equation ( [ equation1 ] ) is called _ non - resonant _ if all its periodic solutions are non - resonant .    from now on",
    "we assume that eq.([equation1 ] ) is non - resonant .",
    "this is a technical assumptions which makes easier to use morse theory .",
    "in fact , if @xmath34 is a non - resonant t - periodic solutions , it is a non - degenerate critical point of ( [ functional ] ) .",
    "+ the first result of this paper is the following    [ primoteo ] if eq .",

    "clearly any @xmath11-periodic solution @xmath14 is also a @xmath16-periodic solution , @xmath37 ; thus @xmath14 is a critical point of the functional ( [ functional ] ) with @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , and the morse index @xmath40 is well defined for such values of @xmath41 . given a periodic orbit @xmath14 , we define the twisting frequency ( also called the twisting number or the mean index ) @xmath42 as the mean morse index , i.e. @xmath43    the second result of this paper concerns the number of non - fundamental solutions in @xmath44 with @xmath45 prime .",
    "we introduce two function @xmath46 and @xmath47 , that are related to the number of fundamental solutions with twisting frequency less than @xmath42 and rotation frequency @xmath6 . the value of such functions permits to give a lower bound on the number of non - fundamental orbits with rotation frequency @xmath6 in @xmath44 .    in order to state the main theorem we need to to classify the periodic orbits in two classes , the class @xmath48 of periodic orbits with even morse index and the class @xmath49 with odd morse index",
    ".    as we will see , the @xmath48-periodic orbits are those with distinct positive floquet multipliers while the @xmath49-periodic are those possessing negative or complex floquet multipliers .",
    "we set for any @xmath50 and @xmath51    @xmath52    we can define the function @xmath53 and the multiplicity functions @xmath54    by this functions we can prove the second results of this paper    [ maintheorem ]    let @xmath55 with @xmath10 and @xmath12 coprime , @xmath45 prime , and assume that eq.([equation1 ] ) is non - resonant .",
    "then , the periodic solutions in @xmath56 having rotation frequency @xmath6 , and morse index @xmath57 are of type @xmath48 and are at least @xmath58    moreover , the periodic solutions in @xmath44 having rotation frequency @xmath6 , and morse index @xmath59 are of type @xmath49 and are at least @xmath60    as a consequence , we have the following corollary .",

    "then the poincar polynomial @xmath84 is the formal series in the @xmath85 variable with non negative integer coefficients ( maybe infinite ) defined by @xmath86 moreover @xmath87 .    at last , we can state the so called _ morse relations _",

    "this assumption can be substituted with the palais smale compactness condition , recalled below .",

    "it is well known that the functional is @xmath67 on @xmath108 and we can apply the morse theory defining a morse index for every @xmath11-periodic solution of ( [ equation1 ] ) . if @xmath14 is a @xmath11-periodic solutions of equation ( [ equation1 ] ) then @xmath113=\\frac{1}{k_2t_0}\\int_{0}^{k_2t_0}(\\dot{x}\\cdot \\dot{y}-v'(t , x)y)dt=0\\ ] ] for all @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",

    "we denote @xmath117 the morse index relative to the @xmath11 periodic orbit @xmath14 , i.e. the signature of ( [ funzionale  ] ) .",
