    "inflation is a very short epoch at very early stages of the history of the universe in which the universe experiences a very rapidly accelerated expansion .",
    "this phase first proposed in @xcite , to solve some of the problems of the hot big bang model of cosmology , such as flatness problem , horizon problem and monopole problem .",
    "this model of inflation improved gradually to a more accurate scenario called slow - roll inflation which supports a long enough period of inflation @xcite,@xcite .",
    "but maybe , the true merit of inflation is that it provides some inhomogeneities in the universe arisen from vacuum fluctuations and so can explain the large scale structure of the universe and the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite,@xcite .",
    "there are several inflationary models which differ in their expression of scale factor parameter , @xmath0 . among them , the intermediate inflation is of particular interest because it arises from an effective theory at low dimension of a more fundamental string theory @xcite . in this class of inflationary models , the scale factor varies with time faster than the scale factor of power law inflation in which @xmath1 , but still slower than the scale factor of standard de - sitter inflation in which @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , is the hubble parameter and dot means derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath4 .",
    "the behavior of scale factor parameter in terms of time in intermediate inflationary models is expressed as @xmath5 in which @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are constant parameters .    in general , inflation drives by the potential of a standard scalar field , the inflaton , where it obeys the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation .",
    "but , there is a non - standard scalar field action motivated from string theory which can be used to drive an inflationary phase , called tachyon field @xcite-@xcite .",
    "because its equation of state parameter is bounded as , @xmath8 , it can play the role of inflaton field , well @xcite-@xcite",
    ". tachyon field has some other applications in cosmology , too .",
    "it can play the role of dark sectors of the universe @xcite-@xcite .",
    "also , in @xcite , it has been shown that the tachyon field can drive inflation and then behave as dark matter or a non - relativistic fluid . in principle , the tachyon inflation is a @xmath9-inflationary model @xcite , with its own features .",
    "it has a positive potential @xmath10 , where has a maximum at @xmath11 and approaches zero when @xmath12 .",
    "meanwhile , during the entire of this process , @xmath13 .    it might be useful to deals with the end of inflation and a mechanism called reheating in which the temperature of the universe grows in many orders of magnitude to recover the big - bang cosmology .",
    "conventionally , this happens when inflaton field starts to oscillate around the minimum of its potential . at this stage ,",
    "most of the matter and radiation of our universe is created via the decay of the inflaton field .",
    "but reheating in all inflationary models inspired by string theory is problematic @xcite .",
    "for instance , one of the characteristics of intermediate inflationary models is that there is not such a minimum in their inflaton potential @xcite .",
    "also , as we mentioned earlier the potential of the tachyon field does not present a minimum at a finite time , too .",
    "thus , in such a models we need a different mechanism to bring inflation to an end .",
    "there are a few other reheating mechanisms @xcite-@xcite , among them the curvaton scenario @xcite , has been more successful to solve the problem in tachyonic and intermediate inflationary models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the theory of extra dimensions which has come out of the string theory , has attracted a great amount of attention in the past two decades .",
    "several five dimensional ( 5d ) cosmological models have been proposed to explain the weakness of gravity and hierarchy problem @xcite-@xcite . in these models",
    "our four dimensional ( 4d ) universe is a surface dubbed brane , embedded into a higher dimensional bulk spacetime .",
    "it is assumed that the standard model of particle physics is confined to the brane and only gravitons can propagate into the bulk .",
    "the important effect of considering extra dimensions is that they modify the friedmann equations by adding some new terms .",
    "these theories , specially the randall - sundrum ( rs ) type ii model , with a fine - tuning relation as @xmath14 , in which @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are cosmological constant on the brane , cosmological constant of the bulk , five dimensional gravitational constant and the tension of the brane respectively , have been widely utilized in the literature to explain the dynamics of the universe , more precisely @xcite,@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one way to generalize the gravitational action of a 5d theory is to bring in an induced gravity correction through considering a 4d scalar curvature term in the brane action in addition to the matter lagrangian in it .",
    "a well - known example of induced - brane gravity model is the dgp model @xcite . in this model",
    ", our 4d brane is embedded into an infinite 5d minkowskian bulk . also , in dgp model the cosmological constant of the bulk and of the brane and the brane tension set to zero , simultaneously .",
    "dgp model consists of two separate branches depending on how the brane embeds into the bulk .",
    "these branches where distinguish with a parameter @xmath19 , have distinct characteristics .",
    "for instance , the case @xmath20 , called self - accelerating branch , induces a late - time acceleration without need to a dark energy component and the case @xmath21 , called normal branch against the prior needs a dark energy component to explain the late - time acceleration .",
    "dgp model has been frequently utilized in studying the dynamics of the universe in its dark dominated stages @xcite-@xcite and in the inflationary era @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite and @xcite , intermediate and warm intermediate inflation in the context of dgp cosmology but in the absence of tachyon field has been studied , respectively . on the other hand , tachyon as an inflaton field has been used in @xcite , in the context of intermediate inflation in brane cosmology , but not a dgp - brane scenario . in this manuscript",
    "we will investigate a tachyonic intermediate inflationary model in dgp cosmology .",
    "our motivation to considering such a model in addition to fill the gap mentioned above is that all the pillars of our model , i.e. , intermediate inflation , tachyon scalar field and the higher dimensional dgp model , come from string theory and may lead to new and interesting results .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in the next section",
    "we start with the action of the dgp model . considering the slow - roll inflationary conditions and in the high energy regime",
    "the effective friedmann equation and kg equation of the tachyon field will be obtained . after introducing the slow - roll parameters , in section iii , we derive some important parameters related to perturbation theory in our model .",
    "section iv , deals with numeric approaches to test the validity of our model .",
    "to this aim we use recent observational constraints from planck satellite .",
    "the last section will demonstrate a summary of our work and its results .",
    "our starting point is the action of dgp brane - world model which can be written as @xmath22 the first term in the above is corresponding to the einstein - hilbert action in a 5d minkowskian bulk and the second term is the contribution of induced gravity localized on the brane . here",
    ", @xmath23 is the 5d ricci scalar and @xmath24 is the effective 4d lagrangian on the brane which can be expressed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a mass parameter controlling the strength of the induced gravity term , which may correspond to the 4d planck mass , @xmath27 . also , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the ricci scalar and the matter lagrangian on the brane , respectively .",
    "in fact , our action is a special case of a more general induced gravity action in which the cosmological constants in the bulk and on the brane and the tension of the brane have been set to zero .",
    "considering the most relevant spatially flat frw metric on the brane and introducing @xmath30 , we obtain the friedmann equation of our model as @xmath31 in which @xmath32 can take the values @xmath331 , as we mentioned earlier . since inflation is a period in the very early universe , we impose the high energy condition @xmath34 @xcite;@xcite in our model . for latter convenience",
    "we rewrite the effective friedmann equation in the inflationary era as @xmath35 one can check that equation ( [ he ] ) is a suitable approximation of the related effective friedmann equation in literature @xcite;@xcite .    apparently , from the action , the matter is only confined to the brane , so it obeys the standard form of conservation equation @xmath36 in the following we will consider a tachyon scalar field as the matter on the brane which plays the role of inflaton field in the inflationary era . for a tachyon field ,",
    "the energy density and the pressure are given by @xmath37 where @xmath10 , is the tachyon potential .",
    "replacing eqn.([rho ] ) in ( [ cons ] ) , one obtains the equation of motion of the tachyon field as , @xmath38 in which @xmath39 . using equations ( [ he ] ) , ( [ cons ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) , we reach to @xmath40 in which @xmath41 . considering intermediate inflationary scenario with the scale factor @xmath42",
    ", we obtain a solution for the above equation as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the integration constant and means @xmath45 .",

    "eqns.([he ] ) and ( [ field ] ) reduce to @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",

    ", it can be expressed as @xmath72.\\ ] ]",
    "while homogeneous and isotropic universe assumption is valid in studying cosmology , in recent observations the existence of some deviations from this assumption are undoubted",
    ". therefore , it seems necessary to consider the perturbation analysis of the model .",
    "the attractive feature of gravity can cause growing the inhomogeneities with time and since they are very small in early universe one can assume a linear perturbation scenario in inflation period . here , we focus on a perturbed inflaton field in a perturbed geometry .",
    "the most general linearly perturbed flat frw metric which includes both scalar and tensor perturbations can be written as @xmath73dx^idx^j,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the scalar metric perturbations and @xmath76 is the transverse - traceless tensor perturbation . for describing the distinctive nature of perturbations , we use both power spectrum of the curvature and tensor perturbation , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "these quantities appear in deriving the correlation function of the inflaton field in the vacuum state .    for the tachyon field , @xmath77 ,",
    "is defined as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 @xcite . in slow - roll approximation",

    "similar to @xcite and @xcite , we can introduce a new parameter @xmath86 , where @xmath87 , is a dimensionless constant . in a model without induced gravity correction such as rs model , we have @xmath88 . using eqn.([pr1 ] ) and for given values of @xmath32 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath27 , @xmath91 , @xmath84 and @xmath77 , we can find a constraint on the parameter @xmath92 , numerically . in the following we will work in the normal branch of dgp model in which @xmath21 .",
    "later , we will explain why we have neglected the case @xmath20 .",
    "also , in @xcite , applying low energy condition into the friedmann equation , the authors have shown that the parameter @xmath91 , should be at least in the order of @xmath93 , as the current critical energy density of our universe . using @xmath94 and @xmath95 and assuming @xmath96 and @xmath97 , we found constraints on @xmath92 , related to different values of @xmath89 .",

    ".constraints on @xmath92 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table:1 ]    on the other hand , tensor perturbation would produce gravitational waves during inflation .",
    "since an extra dimension allows gravitons to propagate into the bulk , the tensor perturbation is more important in our model .",
    "the amplitude of tensor perturbations in an induced gravity model has been calculated in @xcite and @xcite , @xmath98 this form of amplitude of tensor perturbations differs from its expression in a standard 4d general theory of relativity by the coefficient @xmath99 , here , @xmath100 is defined as @xmath101^{-1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath102 , and @xmath103 is the energy scale associated with the bulk curvature . noting that , for derving the amplitude of tensor perturbations one needs the amplitude of the zero - mode metric fluctuations on the brane . from @xcite , in a brane - world inflation with induced gravity , the zero - mode is not normalizable in the positive branch , @xmath20 . as a result , in here we restrict our calculations to the negative or normal branch , @xmath21 .",
    "since we are working with a original dgp model in which the bulk is minkowskian , we have @xmath104 . in another word ,",
    "the energy scale at which inflation begins will satisfies the condition @xmath105 . according to @xcite , under this condition , eqn.([power - tensorper ] ) , reduces to @xmath106 therefore , in the context of intermediate inflation we obtain @xmath107^{2(f-1)}.\\ ] ] another useful quantity in studying perturbation theory is tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath108 which is the ratio between power spectrum of tensor perturbation and power spectrum of scalar perturbation . in our model eqn.([r ] ) , reduces to @xmath109^{1-f}\\right)\\left[{{\\cal{b}}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{c}\\right)}\\right]^{-f}\\cdot\\ ] ]    identification of two other parameters in the topic of scalar perturbation in cosmology is of particular interest .",

    "different extensions of the @xmath122cdm cosmological model have been investigated by utilizing distinct observational data sets to perform analysis related to perturbations .",
    "the important feature of these extended models is that they can relieve the tensions between some of the observational data . from fig.([fig2 ] ) , it is obvious that in @xmath122cdm+@xmath133+@xmath142 model , our model fits the observations well for @xmath144 .",

    "( [ fig3 ] ) and ( [ fig4 ] ) simultaneously , we obtain the same result , i.e. , the model is consistent with observations for @xmath144 . in all these cases , for @xmath144 we have @xmath151 .",
    "it seems that the closest scenario in our model to the harrison - zeldovich model with @xmath117 , is reached for @xmath152 .",
