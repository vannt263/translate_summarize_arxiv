    "in many physical systems , nonlinear interactions give rise to couplings between different dynamical scales . in the case of an electrically neutral fluid flow , the velocity field represents the dynamical quantity of interest and the couplings occur between different scales of motion .",
    "a similar picture exists for an electrically conductive fluid , where the interplay between velocity and the self - consistent magnetic field gives rise to alfvn waves .",
    "the nonlinear interaction can now be interpreted either as the couplings of velocity and magnetic scales or scattering of counter - propagating alfvn waves of different sizes . for kinetic systems , where the dynamical quantity is represented by a probability distribution function , defined in a six - dimensional phase space ,",
    "the picture becomes more complicated .",
    "not only that spatial and velocity structures evolve differently , the dynamics can involve moments of the distribution function .",
    "these moments can be seen , to an extent , as preferential modes of the distribution function that mediate the nonlinear interactions .",
    "this situation is present , as well , for magnetized plasmas described kinetically using the gyrokinetic approximation .",
    "@xcite the gyrokinetic ( gk ) formalism , valid for a plasma evolving under the influence of a strong magnetic guide field and which obeys the gyrokinetic ordering , represents a self - consistent method of removing the fast gyration phase from the motion of charged particles and decreasing the distribution function phase space from six to five dimensions@xcite .",
    "the influence of the magnetic guide field on the system leads to the development of a spatial anisotropy .",
    "moreover , a similar anisotropy is also developed in velocity space .",
    "it should be understood that these anisotropic directions occur at the dynamical level of the equations and that the perpendicular velocity symmetry is taken into account explicitly by the gyrokinetic formalism .",
    "thus , any non - trivial geometry of the magnetic field ( non - slab , or in general possessing a non - diagonal metric ) will intrinsically complicate the development and saturation of gk turbulence , i.e. , the couplings between different dynamical scales .    for a turbulent gk state ,",
    "the dynamics determine the type of structures that develop along each direction and influence the linear and nonlinear redistribution of energy in the system .",
    "as such , investigating the energy redistribution problem for a spectral form of the gk equations can lead to insight regarding the dynamics of the equations .",
    "while different approaches exist for the study of the dynamics introduced by the linear terms , the nonlinear terms drastically limit the available possibilities . to understand the dynamics introduced by the nonlinear term , the redistribution of free - energy ( a gk ideal invariant , i.e. , a global quantity that remains constant in time in the absence of source and sink effects ) is usually investigated . in the current work",
    ", we will only look at the redistribution of energy between perpendicular spatial scales , obtained as the integration of contributions along all other directions .",
    "while this represents a point of interest in the study of gk turbulence , it should always be remembered that the fundamental dynamics occur in a higher dimensional space that links spatial and velocity dynamics ( linear@xcite and nonlinear @xcite phase space mixing ) , as well as the perpendicular and parallel spatial scales ( the concept of critical balance @xcite ) .",
    "this is important , as investigating the energetic exchanges of the perpendicular spatial scales only captures part of the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "understanding the behavior of gk turbulence in the perpendicular directions is important for ( heat and particles ) transport studies , with relevance to the field of fusion research .",
    "the choice of this study to concentrate on the interaction of scales and not of modes@xcite is given in part by practical concerns .",
    "promising modeling techniques , like application of large eddy simulations ( les ) to gk turbulence @xcite , rely on the concept of scales , on their separation and on their local energetic interaction .",
    "furthermore , these concepts form the basis of our phenomenological understanding of the problem . to facilitate the analysis , a fourier mode decomposition of the distribution function in the perpendicular spatial directions",
    "is used . in general ,",
    "well - suited decompositions are needed to give modes proper physical significance ( e.g. , using spherical harmonics for spherical symmetric problems ) . since a natural mode decomposition choice that would depend on the complex geometry",
    "is not known to us , we prefer to build our understanding on the phenomenological relevant concept of scales and not on the plane - wave modes . although the spectral modes enter in the nonlinear dynamics , it is the scales that posses phenomenological information and that can be measured experimentally .",
    "the presence of a complex magnetic geometry complicates further the link between dynamical relevant modes and the spatial scales , as perpendicular wavenumbers contribute to more than one perpendicular scale . from this perspective",
    ", contributions to perpendicular scales made by modes that possess special symmetries , like the zonal flow , are accounted for separately .",
    "while the separation is done at the mode level , the energetic interaction is still performed from the perspective of the scales .",
    "this aspect of the problem will be detailed in the current work .",
    "we apply this analysis to ion temperature gradient ( itg ) and electron temperature gradient ( etg ) turbulence .",
    "the mathematical difference between these two cases consists in the adiabatic response given by the electro - neutrality condition , which enters in the gk poisson equation .",
    "the two cases differ by an additional nonlinear term mediated by the electrostatic potential resulting from the flux - surface average contribution to the electro - neutrality condition . as such , in our analysis , we separate the flux - surface average contribution ( responsible for the generation of zonal flows ) of the electrostatic potential that appears for the itg case compared to the etg one .    considering the phenomenological interpretation of turbulence , as cascades of energy between scales , decomposing the net transfers into the forward ( positive ) and backward ( negative )",
    "contributions allows us to better understand the nature of the energetic exchanges that take place .",
    "this analysis is particularly important for the development of more advanced les models for gk turbulence .",
    "furthermore , looking at the problem from the perspective of scale fluxes , including the scale locality of flux contributions @xcite ( measuring the contribution of an energy flux through a scale from scales progressively dissimilar in size ) , provides overall understanding of the gk turbulence problem . to ease the reading of the manuscript",

    "we continue by presenting the scale decomposition in section  [ seciii ] , the transfers analysis in section  [ seciv ] , the scale flux analysis in section  [ secv ] and end with a discussion of the problem from a theoretical and modeling perspective .",

    "<S> in magnetized plasma turbulence , the couplings of perpendicular spatial scales that arise due to the nonlinear interactions are analyzed from the perspective of the free - energy exchanges . </S>",
    "<S> the plasmas considered here , with appropriate ion or electron adiabatic electro - neutrality responses , are described by the gyrokinetic formalism in a toroidal magnetic geometry . </S>",
    "<S> turbulence develops due to the electrostatic fluctuations driven by temperature gradient instabilities , either ion temperature gradient ( itg ) or electron temperature gradient ( etg ) . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis consists in decomposing the system into a series of scale structures , while accounting separately for contributions made by modes possessing special symmetries ( e.g. , the zonal flow modes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of these scales is analyzed using the energy transfer functions , including a forward and backward decomposition , scale fluxes and locality functions . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between the itg and etg cases shows that etg turbulence has a more pronounced classical turbulent behavior , exhibiting a stronger energy cascade , with implications for gyrokinetic turbulence modeling . </S>"
