    "the electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of quantum dots , including excitons,@xcite charged excitons,@xcite multiexcitons,@xcite and excitonic fine - structure,@xcite all depend on the size and shape of the dots .",
    "this dependence reflects both quantum confinement effects , as well as shape - induced band - folding and inter - band coupling.@xcite _ simulations _ of electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of quantum dots@xcite must naturally assume the size and shape of the dot .",
    "on the other hand , _ measurements _ of spectroscopic properties of a dot@xcite are rarely accompanied by accurate measurements of the size and shape of the gaas - covered dot , except in rare cases where detailed cross - sectional scanning tunneling microscopy experiments are performed , such as in refs . .",
    "this situation creates a significant difficulty , if not a crisis , in interpreting spectroscopic data on quantum dots , and in critically testing various theoretical approaches .",
    "thus , in reality one is often forced to address the inverse problem,@xcite namely , fit the spectroscopic data to a theoretical model by using the size and shape as adjustable parameters .",
    "the difficulty with this approach is threefold : first , in this approach all theories , no matter how nave , ultimately work by virtue of forcing a fit to experiment , even if the assumptions entering the theory may seem unjustified in their own right ( e.g. assuming single - band effective mass ; neglect of strain ; neglect of spin - orbit coupling . ) second , there are usually too many free - parameters , which involve not only non - trivial shapes , but also unknown composition profiles ( e. g. , in@xmath6ga@xmath7as dots ) .",
    "third , since the relationship between shape and spectroscopic properties is model dependent , unrealistic shapes are often deduced .",
    "for example , in simple effective - mass,@xcite k@xmath2p,@xcite or parabolic models the `` p '' and `` d '' levels of electrons and holes are degenerate if one assumes spherical , lens - shaped , cubic , or cylindrical dots .",
    "in contrast , in more advanced",
    "_ atomistic _",
    "models  like empirical pseudopotential@xcite or tight binding@xcite  those levels are split even for the above mentioned ideal shapes , resulting in clear spectroscopic signatures . to fit measured spectroscopic signatures of actual dots by simple theoretical models , one needs to assume at the outset irregular shapes .",
    "for instance , dekel _",
    "et al._@xcite needed to assume a parallepipedal box to explain their multiexciton data on non - alloyed inas / gaas dots ; and ferreira assumed shape distortions to explain fine structure.@xcite such assumptions are not needed in atomistic approaches to modeling .    in this work we have used a high - level atomistic approach to predict the spectroscopic characteristics of in@xmath8ga@xmath1as / gaas self - assembled dots as a function of the most crucial geometric parameter , namely the heigh .",
    "we calculate strain profiles , `` p- '' and `` d-''level splittings as well as electron and hole wavefunctions .",
    "while ultimately it will be necessary for experimentalists to report the size , shape , and composition profile to which their spectroscopic data correspond , the type of study reported here may be used to bridge , in the interim , spectroscopy with theory without clouding the issue by severe theoretical approximations .",

    "a section of the gaas matrix ( grey ) has been ommited for clarity .",
    "the dot ( white ) is lens shaped with base diameter @xmath14 and height @xmath11 .",
    "the dot lies on top of a 1-monolayer - thick in@xmath8ga@xmath1as wetting layer .",
    "two auxiliary features are shown : ( i ) a plane that bisects the dot ( dashed lines ) and ( ii ) the line @xmath15 , which pierces the dot through the center along the [ 001 ] direction.,width=283 ]      the position - dependent strain profiles present in the nanostructure are usually addressed within ( harmonic ) _ continuum _ elasticity ( ce ) theory.@xcite notwithstanding , strain profiles can also be calculated within atomistic elasticity ( ae ) in the form of a valence force field.@xcite in ae the strain energy is expressed in terms of atomic positions and interatomic force constants . while the force constants are fit to the elastic constants @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , much like in ce , expressing the strain in terms of atomic positions contains much more information than expressing strain in terms of ce coordinates .",
    "for example , a square - based pyramid has a @xmath19 point group symmetry if described by ce .",
    "this means that the @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath20 $ ] facets are taken to be equivalent . in this case , all `` p '' energy levels are degenerate .",

    "the [ 110 ] and @xmath20 $ ] facets are symmetry - inequivalent and `` p '' levels are split",
    ".    in general , three interrelated sources are responsible for the splitting of the `` p '' states.@xcite a quantum dot with a base that globally possesses inversion symmetry in the ( 001 ) plane  like a lens , a truncated pyramid or a truncated cone  has in reality the lower @xmath21 symmetry ( for pure , non - alloyed inas / gaas dots ) , which originates from the underlying zinc - blende atomic lattice .",
    "thus , the _ first source _ is the lack of inversion symmetry in the @xmath21 point group , which manifests itself around the dot - matrix interfaces where the [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath220 ] directions are inequivalent .",
    "the _ second source _ is the propagation of the strain field towards the center of the dot as a consequence of the atomic relaxation .",
    "the _ third source _ is the piezoelectric effect ( which magnitude is presently under debate@xcite ) that arises from the strain field of @xmath21 symmetry .",
    "it should be noted that approximations used in previous calculations of the piezoelectric effect @xcite have been shown to be crude and further investigations have been called for.@xcite    our choice of ae is based on a generalization of keating model to 3 terms  bond - bending , bond stretching and their cross terms.@xcite we fit the elastic constants @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 of zinc - blende inas and gaas , as well as the correct dependence of the young s modulus with pressure for both materials . in the in@xmath8ga@xmath1as alloy system ,",
    "the bond - stretching and the bond - stretching / bond - bending cross - term parameters for the mixed cation ga - as - in bond angle are taken as the algebraic average of the in - as - in and ga - as - ga values . while the ideal bond angle is @xmath23 for the pure zinc - blende crystal , to satisfy vegard s law for the alloy volume , the value of @xmath24 was used for the mixed bond angle .",
    "ae is superior to ce in that it does not assume harmonicity  in fact , anharmonic effects can be explicitly included@xcite into the valence force field.@xcite    here , we calculate the position - dependent strain tensor @xmath25 within the atomistic elasticity approach . to calculate the strain tensor cubic components @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 )",
    ", we proceed in two steps : ( 1 ) we relax the atomic positions within the supercell in order to minimize the elastic energy , which is given by a generalized valence force field.@xcite ( 2 ) we relate the relaxed ( equilibrium ) atomic positions with the unrelaxed atomic positions via strain tensor.@xcite at each equilibrium position @xmath30 of atom @xmath31 we identify the tetrahedron formed by its 4 nearest neighbors .",
    "this tetrahedron is distorted in comparison to the unrelaxed tetrahedron .",
    "thus , the three edges of these tetrahedra that are determined by the vectors connecting the four neighbors can be related by the strain tensor @xmath32 as follows .    @xmath33    where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the 3 vectors that connect , respectively , neighbors 1 and 2 , 2 and 3 , and 3 and 4 in the equilibrium , distorted tetrahedron that encloses atom @xmath31 .",

    "figure [ fig_2 ] shows the biaxial strain    @xmath40    and the hydrostatic distortion ( isotropic strain ) @xmath41 as a function of dot height .",
    "the results presented correspond to the strain values on a planar section in the [ 100 ] direction that bisects the dot ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) .",
    "the spikes in the dot and wetting layer region are a consequence of the random arrangement of in and ga atoms .",
    "thus , the spikes structure significantly changes from dot to dot .",
    "two additional features are also prominent .",
    "( i ) the biaxial strain at the dot - matrix interface , located near the top of the dot , increases with height and slowly decays off .",
    "this decay is faster as the dot becomes taller .",
    "the latter can be understood by considering the dot as a spherical cap inscribed in a sphere of radius @xmath42/2h$ ] ( the _ taller _ the dot , the _ smaller _ @xmath43 ) and by assuming that the decay of @xmath44 outside the dot is qualitatively well described by @xmath45 , which is the radial dependence of the biaxial strain outside a continuum , elastic sphere of radius @xmath43 embedded in a lattice - mismatched medium.@xcite here , @xmath46 is the radial distance from the sphere surface . in our simulations , @xmath47 shows a similar trend as @xmath44 .",
    "( ii ) due to the underlying zincblende atomic structure , the biaxial strain drops to zero along the @xmath48 $ ] and @xmath49 $ ] directions , as well as along their equivalent crystallographic directions .",
    "( see white arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] . )",
    "this feature is robust upon changes in height , being present for all the quantum dots we considered .      to calculate the energies and wavefunctions of electron and hole states in the quatum dot",
    ", we use the empirical pseudotential method of wang and zunger.@xcite this approach combines a pseudopotential description of the single - particle hamiltonian with the linear combination of bulk bands ( lcbb ) method to solve for the energies and wavefunctions.@xcite in this method , the hamiltonian reads    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is an empirical parameter that accounts for non - locality effects ; @xmath53 is a non - local empirical operator that describes the spin - orbit interaction;@xcite @xmath54 is a screened pseudopotential ( for atom of type @xmath55 ) that depends on strain ; and @xmath56 is the relaxed vector position of atom @xmath31 of type @xmath55 .",
    "the dependence of the atomic pseudopotential on strain transfers to the electronic hamiltonian the information on atomic displacements .",

    "it should be noted that @xmath59 is fit to _ bulk _ properties of gaas and inas , including bulk band structures , experimental deformation potentials and effective masses , and lda - determined band offsets . in order to improve the transferability of pseudopotential @xmath59 , a simple dependence on the chemical environment of atom @xmath55 is introduced .",
    "for instance , for @xmath60 in an environment of @xmath61 ga atoms and @xmath62 in atoms we use    @xmath63    the pseudopotentials used in this work have been successfully tested for quantum wells.@xcite    the wavefunction of state @xmath64 is @xmath65 , which satisfies @xmath66 , is expanded in bulk bloch states @xmath67 of material @xmath68 .",

    "the calculated wavefunctions @xmath74 are 2-fold , kramers degenerate , so we have omitted the spin index @xmath75 .",
    "this representation for the wave function is very different from the familiar k@xmath2p method in that in the latter approach the basis set is constructed only from states near the brillouin zone center ( @xmath76 ) , while here we use a full - zone description .",
    "further , in k@xmath2p one is restricted to just one or two bloch bands at @xmath76 ( @xmath77 representating two bloch bands ) while here we consider @xmath70 bloch bands . in appendix",

    "[ hamiltonian.lcbb ] , here , for _ illustrative purposes only _ , we calculate the conduction ( electron ) and valence ( hole ) strain - modified band offsets ( confining potentials ) present in the quantum dot by coupling strain to k@xmath2p - like equations . at each 8-atom unit cell in the supercell we diagonalize the conduction and valence ( including spin - orbit coupling ) band strain hamiltonians that wei and zunger put forward in ref . .",
    "figure [ fig_3 ] shows the calculated strain - modified band offsets for electrons and holes along the line @xmath15 indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "electron band offset appears in the upper panel , whereas thick and thin lines in the lower panel show the first and second holes offsets , respectively .",
    "we note the following features .",
    "( i ) the band offsets ( fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ) inherit the jagged nature of the strain fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) . inside the quantum dot ( region `` d '' in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ) , alloy fluctuations lead to a small mixing in the heavy - hole ( hh ) and light - hole ( lh ) character of the band offsets .",
    "( ii ) regardless of the dot height , the higher energy hole band offset has hh character inside the dot and lh outside .",
    "conversely , the lower energy hole band offset has lh character inside and hh outside .",
    "( iii ) the increase of biaxial strain at the dot - matrix interface that occurs as the height increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) is reflected in the increase ( decrease ) of the higher ( lower ) energy hole band offset .",
    "( see arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ) .",
    "in particular , for tall dots , the decrease of the lower energy hole offset at the interface leads to the formation of a _ pocket _ in the band offset .",
    "the single - band effective mass model predicts that in the continuum limit , in which lens - shaped dots have full axial symmetry , the confined energy levels will form shells of degenerate states with _",
    "definite _ angular momentum @xmath79 .",
    "@xcitethus , the _ orbital _",
    "character of the confined levels will be _ pure _ `` s '' , `` p '' , `` d '' , etc .",
    "however , when the correct symmetry of the dot is taken in to account , as it is the case when using our atomistic pseudopotential method , the confined energy levels can have mixed orbital character . to quantify the degree of mixing ,",

    "hence , hole localization does not have its origin on geometrical aspects of the quantum dots .",
    "instead , the localization of the hole wavefunctions is driven by the biaxial strain present in the nanostructure ( qd+gaas matrix ) . to explain this result , we plot in fig . [ fig_8prime](a ) the valence band offsets of heavy - hole ( hh ) and light - hole ( lh ) character ( inside the dot ) along the line @xmath15 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_1 ] and [ fig_3 ] ) and the energy of homo and homo@xmath1521 ( thick dashes ) .",
    "in addition , we plot in fig . [ fig_8prime](b ) a 3-dimensional rendering of the higher energy hole band offset values at a plane normal to @xmath15 , cut slightly above the base of the dot . _ first _ , we see that as the dot heigh increases the pocket structure [ indicated with arrows in fig . [ fig_8prime](a ) ] that appears in the higher energy band offset dramatically widens the confining potential ( given by the band offset ) along @xmath162 and that the band offsets values decrease .",
    "further , the band offset become assymetric with the values at the top of the dot _ smaller _ that at the _ base_. as a consequence , it becomes clear why the energy of the homo and homo-1 become bigger and we also expect the wavefunctions of these states to be localized near the base of the dot .",
    "it is important to mention that in the calculation of the energy of the homo and homo@xmath1521 we do not utilize the band offset we present in fig .",
    "[ fig_8prime](a ) . _",
    "second _ , the band offsets shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_8prime ] present a `` crown '' structure at the dot - matrix interface.@xcite this crown structure becomes more significant as height increases , as a consequence of the values of band offset along the @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] direction presenting a weak dependence on height .",
    "_ finally _ , the localization of the low - lying hole wave functions that develops as the height of pure , non - alloyed inas / gaas lens - shaped quantum dots is a results of the peculiar characteristics of the higher energy valence - band offsets , which in turn are determined by the biaxial strain profile in the nanostructure .",
    "finally , it should be noticed that electron states do not experience interface localization ; instead , they continue to form shells and the levels in these shells have a predominant , not - mixed orbital character ( `` s '' , `` p '' , @xmath3 ) .",
    "the reason for the absence of electron localization is that electron states are sensitive to the ( hydrostatic ) isotropic strain rather than to the biaxial strain .",

    "however , the scaling with height differs significantly from predictions of single - band , effective mass ( @xmath166).@xcite namely , by fitting our results for the height dependence of the gap to the function @xmath167 we find @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "the value of the gap for large heights correspond , respectively , to @xmath170 and @xmath171 in the single - particle and ci approach .",
    "we expect the sp and ci scaling exponents to be different , as in the single - particle calculation the scaling is dictated by the scaling of the lumo and homo , whereas in the ci calculation the electron - hole matrix elements are also included and the magnitude of these matrix elements decreases with height .",
    "the discrepancy between the scaling ( @xmath172 ) in single - band effective mass and both our sp and ci calculations can be attributed to non - trivial effects that are naturally accounted for within our atomistic approach such as non - parabolicity and multiband effects , and the position - dependent strain present in the nanostructure .",

    "\\(v ) in alloy dots , regardless of height , the wavefunction of low - lying ( near the homo ) hole states are localized inside the dot . remarkably , in pure , non - alloyed inas / gaas dots , as the dot height increases , these states become localized at the dot - matrix interface and nearly degenerate .",

    "notwithstanding , it should be noted that although the strain may be converged within the dot the strain values at the boundary of the supercell may not be zero due to the slow relaxation of the strain fields .",
