    "the study of single - domain magnetic particles has been an active field of research since the pioneer work of stoner and wohlfarth @xcite , who studied the hysteretic rotation of the magnetisation over the magnetic - anisotropy energy barrier under the influence of applied fields , and nel @xcite who predicted that at non - zero temperature the magnetisation can surmount the energy barrier as a result of thermal agitation .",
    "important progress has been made since brown @xcite derived the fokker ",
    "plank equation for the probability distribution of spin orientations , starting from the stochastic landau ",
    "lifshitz equation , and calculated the relaxation time for uniaxial particles in a longitudinal field .",
    "recent work on spins with non - axially symmetric potentials revealed @xcite a large dependence of the relaxation time on the damping coefficient @xmath0 in the medium - to - weak damping regime ( @xmath0 measures the relative importance of the precession and the damping in the dynamics ) .",
    "experiments on individual nanoparticles @xcite analysed with accurate asymptotes of the relaxation time @xcite , gave damping coefficients in that regime : @xmath1@xmath2 .    turning our attention from independent particles to systems of interacting particles ,",
    "the complexity of the problem increases drastically , as it becomes a many - body problem with a long - ranged and reduced symmetry interaction mechanism  the dipolar interaction .",
    "the approach to study the relaxation time @xmath3 has so far been based on how the energy barriers of the spins are modified by the interactions @xcite . with the @xmath3 so obtained",
    ", one can study the effects of the interaction on the superparamagnetic blocking ( the maximum in the dynamical response at the temperature where @xmath3 becomes of the order of the observation time ) .",
    "however , the barrier - based approach to determine @xmath3 corresponds to assuming @xmath4 , so that dynamical features such as the precession of the spins are disregarded , as incisively noted by berkov and gorn @xcite .",
    "indeed , numerical integration of the stochastic landau  lifshitz equation for weakly interacting systems revealed @xcite non - trivial effects of finite damping on the superparamagnetic blocking , such as enhanced shifts of the temperature of the maximum of the dynamical response and non - monotonic behaviour of its height with the interaction strength .    in this article",
    "we apply thermodynamic perturbation theory ( treating the anisotropy energy exactly and the dipolar energy perturbatively ) to calculate the averages of the dipolar field produced at the position of a given spin .",
    "these averages are then introduced in a rigorous low - field expansion of the single - spin relaxation rate , which can be combined with a recently derived perturbative formula for the equilibrium susceptibility @xcite to provide a model for the dynamical susceptibility of weakly interacting spins . in the low temperature range , where the superparamagnetic blocking takes place",
    ", our model recreates the non - trivial damping dependence of the blocking found in ref .",
    "the analytical treatment permits us to ascribe the observed features to the deviations from uniaxial symmetry of the potential due to the transversal components of the dipolar field , deviations which render the relaxation time very sensitive to the damping .",
    "in weak fields , we can handle the field dependence of the relaxation time @xmath3 by expanding the relaxation rate @xmath5 in powers of the field components ( for convenience we use the field in temperature units @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the magnetic moment ) .",
    "as the spins have inversion symmetry in the absence of the field , the relaxation rate will not change if the field is reversed ( since @xmath8 accounts for jumps over the energy barrier in both directions ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 should be an even function of @xmath9 , and hence all odd order coefficients in the expansion must be identically zero . for spins with uniaxial anisotropy ,",
    "the second order corrections can be written in terms of the longitudinal @xmath10 and transverse @xmath11 components of the field with respect to the anisotropy axis .",
    "using , for instance , the invariance of the relaxation rate upon field reflection through the barrier plane , where @xmath11 does not change but @xmath10 is reversed , we see that no quadratic term of the form @xmath12 can occur .",
    "this leads to the following generic form for the relaxation rate of uniaxial spins in the presence of a weak , arbitrarily directed , field @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the zero - field relaxation rate and the expansion is actually valid to third order .",
    "the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 will be determined by choosing special configurations in which they are known ( strictly longitudinal and transverse fields ) .",
    "we shall restrict our attention to low temperatures where the superparamagnetic blocking takes place .",
    "then , the zero - field relaxation rate is given by brown s result @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the relaxation time of isotropic spins , @xmath20 is the anisotropy barrier in temperature units , and corrections of order @xmath21 are disregarded due to the low @xmath22 assumption .",
    "note that in this case ( and also in a longitudinal field ) the damping parameter @xmath0 only enters through @xmath18 and hence it only matters to establish a global time scale . in other words , the results for different @xmath0 presented in units of @xmath18",
    "show complete dynamical scaling , and in this sense the @xmath0 dependence is said to be trivial .",
    "expanding the corresponding expression for @xmath8 in the presence of a longitudinal field @xmath10 @xcite ( disregarding again @xmath21 terms ) , we find @xmath23 comparison with the general expansion ( [ gamma : expansion : uni : gen ] ) gives the longitudinal coefficient @xmath24",
    ".    there is no general expression for the relaxation time in the presence of a non - zero transverse field valid for all values of the relevant parameters .",
    "nevertheless , garanin _ et al .",

    "( [ gamma : expansion : uni ] ) ( then @xmath35 ) .",
    "this is natural , since in ref .",
    "@xcite the effects of the field were only considered via barrier changes , so that no gyromagnetic effects were included , and their result can only be correct when the precession can be neglected ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "besides , as their linear term disappeared upon random anisotropy averaging , their results will correspond to the limits overdamped _ plus _ random anisotropy of those derived here from eq.([gamma : expansion : uni ] ) .",
    "let us consider a system of magnetoanisotropic spins coupled via the dipole - dipole interaction . the dipolar field at the position @xmath36 of the spin @xmath37 created by all other spins is given by @xmath38 where the term with @xmath39 is omitted",

    "we are assuming that the parameters characterising the different spins are identical ( it is immediate to generalise the expressions for different anisotropy constants , magnetic moments , volumes , etc . ) .    for spins with uniaxial anisotropy the total energy of the system can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the unit vector along the anisotropy axis of the @xmath49th spin",

    "the calculation of the observables reduces to computing averages weighted by the non interacting probability distribution @xmath61 of low grade powers of the spin variables . in this way ,",
    "the results are exact in the magnetic anisotropy and only perturbational in the dipolar interaction .    the averages of terms linear and quadratic in @xmath62 , weighted by the noninteracting distribution , can be calculated by means of the following  algorithms \" @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are arbitrary constant vectors .",

    "( [ boltzmann ] ) to zero order ; @xmath77 only enters in the third order corrections ) .",
    "note that the averaged fields depend on @xmath22 via @xmath78 , reflecting the fact that the field created at a given position can be different if , for example , the source spins are almost freely rotating ( high @xmath22 , @xmath79 ) or are almost parallel to their anisotropy axes ( low @xmath22 , @xmath80 )",
    ".    one may wonder about the validity of these field averages below the superparamagnetic blocking , where the spins are not in complete equilibrium .",
    "however , since at those temperatures the spins are still in quasi - equilibrium confined to one of the two wells , we can repeat the derivation of the algorithms ( [ alg ] ) restricting the phase space for integration to one well . in this case , averages of the form @xmath81 do not vanish , and should be considered together with @xmath82 , which being even in @xmath62 is not modified .",
    "the extra terms associated with @xmath83 , however , vanish if the overall state is demagnetised , and we recover eqs .",
    "( [ h : para])([h : perp ] )",
    ". this can be interpreted as if two nearby blocked spins , one in its upper well and the other in the lower , create a net field at the position of a third spin similar to that created by any of them when in equilibrium , since each of the spins approximately compensates for the restricted phase space of the other .",
    "the general expressions for the longitudinal and transversal fields are notably simplified in some important situations . for a system with parallel anisotropy axes ( e.g. , in a single crystal of magnetic molecular clusters , or ferrofluids frozen in a strong magnetic field ) we equate all the @xmath84 to @xmath85 . for a system with randomly distributed anisotropy axes",
    "we replace expressions involving @xmath86 by integrals @xmath87 , and use @xmath88 . in both cases",
    "the final expressions involve some rapidly convergent sums over the lattice .",
    "let us concentrate in cases of  sufficiently isotropic \" lattices , in the sense of fulfilling @xmath89 , e.g. , cubic and completely random lattices ( incidentally , the type of arrangements for which in the classical lorentz cavity field calculation the contribution of the dipoles inside the  small \" sphere vanishes ) .",
    "similarly we consider large enough systems , so that all spins have approximately equivalent surroundings ( then the index @xmath49 on the different quantities can be dropped ) . under these circumstances the  lattice sums \" involved are @xmath90 where the terms with @xmath39 are of course omitted .    for a system with aligned anisotropy axes the averaged fields are given in terms of the lattice sums ( [ r&t ] ) by the compact expressions @xmath91 , \\qquad \\big\\langle \\xi_{\\perp}^{2 } \\big\\rangle = \\frac{{\\xi_{\\rm d}}^{2}}{3 } \\left [ ( 2+s_{2 } ) { \\cal r } - 3s_{2}\\,{\\cal t } \\right ] \\;,\\ ] ] while for randomly distributed anisotropy axes they read @xmath92 in both cases @xmath93 is simply given by the temperature independent result @xmath94 .",
    "this independence also holds for the field components after the random anisotropy average [ eq .  ( [ h : para : perp : random ] ) ] , but not for parallel axes [ eq .",
    "( [ h : para : perp : aligned ] ) ] where the field components remain @xmath22 dependent .",
    "the dependence of the features of the superparamagnetic blocking on the interaction strength @xmath95 has been a subject of some controversy . two main approaches @xcite addressed this problem on the basis of the modifications of the energy barriers by the interactions .",
    "however , this type of approach overlooks the fact that not only the energy landscape is important , but also how the spin evolves in it , depending on if the spin is precessing almost freely ( weak damping ) or strongly damped .",
    "indeed , berkov and gorn @xcite have shown with rigorous langevin dynamics simulations that for weak interactions the position of the blocking temperature @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 reaches its maximum ) of strongly damped spins is hardly affected by the interaction strength , whereas for weak damping @xmath96 significantly decreases with @xmath52 and the peak height behaves non - monotonically .",
    "the apparent discrepancy with some experimental results , in which @xmath96 increases with @xmath52 , was attributed in ref.@xcite to the different behaviour of systems with weak anisotropy ( or moderate - to - high interactions ) , where the energy barriers are mostly due to the interactions and hence grow with @xmath52 .    in order to assess the features of the superparamagnetic blocking emerging from our model , we make use of a rigorous perturbative expansion of the equilibrium susceptibility @xmath98 in powers of @xmath56 ( to second order , see ref .",
    "this expression , together with the relaxation rate @xmath8 obtained when the averaged fields ( [ h : para : perp : aligned])([h : para : perp : random ] ) are introduced in eq .",
    "( [ gamma : expansion : uni ] ) , can be combined in a simple debye - type formula @xmath99 naturally , at low enough temperatures @xcite the results will become invalid by the very nature of the approximations involved , although this does not affect the characteristics of the superparamagnetic blocking for weak interactions .    the dynamical response for a large spherical sample with parallel anisotropy axes and simple cubic lattice structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( the lattice sums required are @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) . in the overdamped case , @xmath96 is not noticeably affected by the dipolar interaction and the height of the susceptibility peak decreases monotonically with @xmath52 .",
    "this corresponds to the effect of a slight decrease of @xmath96 found in ref .",
    "@xcite for random anisotropy , which is observable only at very high frequencies ( e.g. , mssbauer ) . for weak",
    "damping , however , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows that the blocking temperature significantly decreases as the interaction strength increases and , in addition , the peak height of @xmath97 initially rises for small values of @xmath52 and then decreases for larger values .",
    "the same behaviour can be seen in @xmath102 with the appropriate choice of parameters .",
    "the features shown in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] are in complete agreement with the results obtained by berkov and gorn @xcite .",
    "the analytical treatment employed here , however , allows us to readily trace back the origin of the results obtained and to interpret them in terms of the different @xmath52 dependences of @xmath8 and @xmath103 . for overdamped systems the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath104 in the expression ( [ gamma : expansion : uni ] ) for the relaxation rate are of order unity and lead to a slight increase of @xmath8 ( decrease of @xmath105 ) with @xmath52 , while the entire curve is lowered by the reduction of @xmath98 with @xmath52 . for weak damping , however , @xmath106 is large and makes @xmath8 very sensitive to the interaction strength , moving the peak quickly towards low @xmath22 as soon as @xmath52 departs from zero .",
    "then , as the coefficients in @xmath98 are not as large as @xmath16 , the initial decrease of the equilibrium susceptibility is smaller than the increase associated to the quick shift of the blocking to low @xmath22 , where @xmath98 is higher ( roughly @xmath107 ) , producing the rise of the peak .",
    "if @xmath52 is further increased the decrease of @xmath98 starts to be competitive and the peaks are reduced as they shift to lower temperatures .",
    "the different behaviours are related to the presence of transverse components of the local fields , which create a saddle point in the uniaxial potential barrier of the spins , turning the relaxation rate sensitive to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we can picture the underlying physical mechanism as follows @xcite .",
    "consider one spin that after a  favourable \" sequence of fluctuations , reaches a point close to the top of the barrier but does not surmount it .",
    "in the subsequent spiralling down back to the bottom of the potential well , a strongly damped spin descends almost immediately , whereas a weakly damped spin executes several rotations ( @xmath108 ) about the anisotropy axis .",
    "this allows the latter spin to pass close to the saddle area , where it will have additional opportunities , not available for the damped spin , to cross the barrier . as we see",
    ", this mechanism duly combines the characteristics of the potential _ and _ the dynamical evolution of the spins in the potential .",
    "note finally that the transverse components are non - zero even for parallel anisotropy axes",
    "( [ h : para : perp : aligned ] ) ] , so there is no need , as in the case of non - interacting particles , to appeal to oblique fields , applied @xcite or probing @xcite , to find a large sensitivity to the damping in interacting systems .",
    "we have proposed a model for the relaxation time of weakly interacting superparamagnets .",
    "the single - spin relaxation time at low fields is generalised for an arbitrary directed field , and the components of the local field calculated by thermodynamical perturbation theory .",
    "the non - monotonic behaviour of the height of the dynamical susceptibility peak with the interaction strength and the increased lowering of the blocking temperature with decreasing damping , discovered numerically by berkov and gorn , are captured by our model .",
    "these features are interpreted in terms of the different sensitivity , depending on the damping strength , of the relaxation rate to transverse fields , which for interacting spins are provided by the dipolar interaction ."
