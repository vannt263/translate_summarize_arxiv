    "the static vacuum spacetime that describes the exterior to an infinite cylinder of matter is the levi - civita ( lc ) spacetime @xcite . in its general form , it contains two independent parameters @xcite , one is the newtonian mass per unit length , usually denoted by @xmath3 , and the other is associated an angle defect .",
    "the generalisation of this spacetime to include a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath4 , which can be either positive or negative , has been obtained by linet @xcite and tian @xcite , and it has been shown by da silva et al .",
    "@xcite and griffiths and podolsk @xcite that some properties of the lc spacetime are dramatically modified .",
    "cylindrically symmetric spacetimes have a wide range of importance to study several physical systems ( see e.g. @xcite and references there in ) .",
    "in particular , the linet - tian ( lt ) spacetime has been used to describe e.g. cosmic strings @xcite and was found to be the unique exterior to some static spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to delve further in understanding the properties of the lt spacetime by restricting to the case @xmath0 . in order to do this ,",
    "we endeavour more deeply into the study of the kinematics and dynamics of its geodesics .",
    "the study of the stability of geodesics around axially symmetric spacetimes in general relativity is an old problem ( see e.g. @xcite ) and it is specially relevant e.g. in the study of the motion of photons and other test particles around astrophysical objects .",
    "two sets of problems connected to this issue , which are still object of research , are the analysis of chaotic motion of geodesics in non - spherical metrics ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the question of the stability of closed timelike curves ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , little has been done about the stability of geodesics with respect to the introduction of a @xmath4 term in the einstein field equations .",
    "banerjee et al .",
    "@xcite were the first to consider the study of geodesics in lt spacetimes by investigating the dynamics of planar geodesics in terms of the constant @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , they derived conditions under which null and timelike geodesics are confined or may escape to infinity . in some cases",
    ", they have also compared their results with the lc case studied in @xcite .    here",
    ", we extend the results of @xcite , giving a clearer view of the parameters involved by defining an appropriate effective potential and by analysing the dynamics of not only planar , but also non - planar geodesics . also , differently from @xcite ,",
    "in some occasions , we use a linear perturbative approach which allows us , in a mathematically more precise way , to study the effects on the orbits of the introduction of an arbitrarily small @xmath4 .",
    "our results also generalize some results obtained in @xcite for the lewis metric in the limit of static spacetimes .",
    "previous results for the lc spacetime are recovered here in the limit @xmath5 and we discuss the differences between the geodesics dynamics in the lt and lc spacetimes . in particular , we investigate how the introduction of @xmath4 interferes with the stability of the geodesics in the lc spacetime .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section 2 , we recall the geodesics system for the lt metric .",
    "section 3 deals with circular geodesics and , in particular , we look at the stability of the geodesics proper radius with respect to the introduction of a linear perturbation in @xmath4 . in section 4 , we study geodesics along the symmetry axis direction and we emphasise the differences between the lt and lc cases . in section 5 , we investigate in detail the dynamics of geodesics along the radial direction .",
    "we define a potential which we use in order to study , separately , planar and non - planar geodesics in lt . in each case",
    ", we split our analysis into null and non - null geodesics , we compare our results with the @xmath1 case and we illustrate our results by plotting numerical simulations of the geodesics dynamics .",
    "we finish the paper with a brief conclusion . throughout",
    ", we use units such that @xmath6=c=1 .",
    "the lt metric can be expressed as @xcite @xmath7 with @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the usual cylindrical coordinates , @xmath13 , the constant @xmath3 is related , but not equal , to the mass per unit length , the constant @xmath14 is related to the angle defect @xcite and , for @xmath0 , @xmath15 in the limit @xmath5 , the metric reduces to the lc metric for which @xmath16 .    for @xmath17",
    ", it is known that the value of @xmath3 makes the axial and angular coordinates switch meaning @xcite . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the spacetime description appears to be similar to the @xmath19 case by redefining @xmath3 . for this reason",
    ", we assume the range of @xmath3 to be @xmath19 .",
    "the lt spacetime with @xmath20 and @xmath21 has some similar characteristics to the de sitter and anti - de sitter spacetimes , since these spacetimes have a zero energy momentum tensor .",
    "however , for @xmath21 , the lt spacetime does not reduce to the de sitter or anti - de sitter spacetimes as @xmath22 , since both spacetimes are not compatible with static cylindrical symmetry .",
    "in fact , if the de sitter and anti - de sitter spacetimes are expressed in cylindrical coordinates , then the metrics are explicitly time dependent @xcite , and are of petrov type d as shown in @xcite .",
    "bonnor @xcite called the lt spacetime with @xmath0 and @xmath20 _ non - uniform anti - de sitter spacetime_.    in what follows , we leave the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath14 as general as possible .",
    "however , some of our calculations will not hold in the cases @xmath24 and these will be treated separately whenever necessary .",
    "in fact , for @xmath24 the spacetime is of petrov type d and has some interesting distinctive properties from the remaining cases , see e.g. @xcite . the case @xmath25 , in particular , upon a coordinate transformation to planar symmetry gives rise to the so called _ black membranes _ @xcite . in this paper , however , we will focus on cylindrically symmetric geometries in which case , as in the lc spacetime , there are no trapped cylinders as we will show next .",
    "we recall that a trapped surface is a 2-dimensional imbedded spatial surface such that its causal future is ( at least initially ) contained within regions of decreasing area . given a surface @xmath26",
    ", one can establish whether it is trapped or not by studying the traces @xmath27 of the null second fundamental forms on @xmath26 defined below @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath26 is a trapped surface if @xmath28 , marginally trapped if @xmath29 and untrapped if @xmath30 .",
    "so , consider 2-surfaces @xmath26 spanned by the vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "one can then define future - directed null vectors orthogonal to @xmath26 as @xmath33 compute the second fundamental forms @xmath34 , on @xmath26 , with @xmath35 , and their traces by using ( [ 1 ] ) , @xmath36\\ ] ] giving @xmath370,\\infty[,\\ ] ] which indicates that there are no trapped cylinders , in this case .",
    "however , as was pointed out in @xcite , there exist families of trapped null planar geodesics and we will explore those aspects in more detail ahead also generalising some of their results to the non - planar case .    from ( [ 1 ] ) , we can obtain the geodesics equations ( see also @xcite ) @xmath38 where the dot and star stand , respectively , for differentiation with respect to an affine parameter @xmath39 and the coordinate @xmath40 . after integrating ( [ 7])-([10 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath41 where @xmath42 for null , timelike and spacelike geodesics , respectively , and the constants @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 represent , respectively , the total energy of the test particle , its momentum along the @xmath11 axis and its angular momentum about the @xmath11 axis , which are all assumed to be finite for @xmath460 , \\infty[$ ] .",
    "circular geodesics for @xmath0 were investigated in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , they found that @xmath3 determines whether the geodesics are timelike , null or spacelike , independently of their radial distance to the axis @xcite .",
    "a similar property was already known for the lc spacetime for which , in the corresponding cases , @xmath3 is lower , equal or greater than @xmath48 .    in this section ,",
    "we focus on the changes introduced in the geodesics dynamics with the inclusion of @xmath4 by studying , in detail , the tangential velocity and acceleration as well as the geodesics proper radius .",
    "we restrict our study to circular geodesics in the plane perpendicular to @xmath11 , in which case @xmath49 , and it is easy to integrate ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) to get simply @xmath50 and @xmath51 or @xmath52 .    from ( [ 8 ] ) , we get @xmath53 where @xmath54 defines the angular velocity of the particle along a geodesic around the @xmath11 axis , whereas its tangential velocity @xmath55 is given by @xcite @xmath56 substituting ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) into ( [ 17 ] ) we obtain @xmath57 having the proper newtonian limit @xmath58 , with @xmath59 . when @xmath1 , i.e. in the lc spacetime , ( [ 18 ] ) becomes @xmath60 which does not depend on @xmath10 meaning that , for every @xmath61 , the circular tangential velocity is fixed in the range @xmath62 .    if @xmath63 , then up to first order in @xmath2 , we obtain from ( [ 18 ] ) @xmath64 showing explicitly how , for @xmath65 , at linear order , @xmath2 increases the corresponding tangential velocity for the lc circular geodesics , while by increasing @xmath10 , increases the tangential velocity too .",
    "however , @xmath66 has the opposite effect .    when @xmath67 , then from ( [ 18 ] ) , @xmath2 has no influence upon the corresponding lc tangential velocity which becomes @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , near the axis , @xmath69 , @xmath55 reduces to @xmath70 since the lt metric reduces to the lc metric ( see also @xcite ) . from (",
    "[ 18 ] ) , as @xmath71 , we have that @xmath72 for any @xmath73 .    by differentiating ( [ 18 ] ) with respect",
    "to @xmath10 we obtain @xmath74 ^ 2},\\ ] ] showing that , for @xmath75 , we get @xmath76 , i.e. the tangential velocity is an increasing function of @xmath10 while , for @xmath66 , @xmath77 and the tangential velocity is a decreasing function of @xmath10 .    for the special cases @xmath24 , whose physical relevance is highlighted e.g. in @xcite , the following results emerge : for @xmath20 , we have from ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ star ] ) , @xmath78 showing that if @xmath79 , then @xmath80 and @xmath81 , while if @xmath71 , then @xmath82 and @xmath83 . for @xmath67",
    ", we have @xmath84 which means that , independently of the @xmath10 distance and the @xmath2 value , the circular geodesics are null in this case , like in the lc spacetime , as observed in ( [ 19a ] ) . for @xmath25 , we have @xmath85 where the tangential velocity for @xmath79 becomes @xmath86 and @xmath87 , while if @xmath71 , then @xmath88 and @xmath87 .",
    "we study the proper radius @xmath89 , as measured in the lt spacetime , under small finite changes @xmath90 in the radial coordinate @xmath10 given by @xmath91 from ( [ four ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) , we obtain @xmath92 , \\label{twentyfive}\\\\ p(\\rho+\\delta\\rho)=p(\\rho)\\left[1+\\sqrt{3|\\lambda|}\\frac{\\delta\\rho}{\\sinh(2r)}\\right ] , \\label{26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following @xmath93\\frac{\\delta\\rho}{\\sinh(2r)}\\right\\}. \\label{27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting ( [ 27 ] ) into ( [ 24 ] ) we obtain @xmath94 which shows that , with increasing @xmath10 , the proper radius increases too ( see also @xcite ) . examples of this dynamical behaviour are depicted in figure [ fig : pr ]",
    ".    for the lc spacetime , @xmath95 , ( [ 28 ] ) reduces to ( see also @xcite p. 176 ) @xmath96 from which can be seen that for @xmath20 , @xmath97 and for @xmath25 , @xmath98 , as expected .    from ( [ 29 ] ) , we have that the variation of the proper radius diminishes gradually , while the coordinate @xmath10 increases , and when @xmath71 we have @xmath99 .",
    "the fact that for large distances @xmath10 , the proper radius becomes nearly constant might explain , in part , the fact that the lc tangential velocity does not depend upon @xmath10 .    if @xmath63 , then up to first order , ( [ 28 ] ) becomes @xmath100 \\rho^{2(1 - 2\\sigma+2\\sigma^2)/\\sigma } \\delta\\rho , \\label{30}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we see that the contribution due to @xmath2 increases the proper distance along @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , from the exact expression @xmath101 we get that , as @xmath102 , @xmath103 grows as @xmath104 . in this sense ,",
    "the proper radius of circular orbits in static vacuum cylindrically symmetric lc spacetimes is asymptotically unstable to the introduction of @xmath0 .",
    "we will get back to the analysis of circular orbits in section 5.1 , where we calculate the minimum radius of the stable orbits .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the dynamics of geodesics in cylindrically symmetric vacuum lt metrics with @xmath0 . in particular we have addressed the question of the stability of the geodesics motion against the introduction of arbitrarily small values of @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that , for planar null geodesics , increasing @xmath2 tends to increase the minimum and maximum radial distances to the axis of the confined geodesics .",
    "non - null geodesics are always confined and the effect of @xmath2 on their extreme distances to the axis depends , in general , on the relative magnitudes of @xmath105 and @xmath3 . in order to quantify that effect in those cases , we have used linear perturbations in @xmath4 .    in turn , for some non - planar null geodesics with arbitrary @xmath106 and some planar null geodesics with @xmath107 , the inclusion of any @xmath0 breaks the orbit confinement of the @xmath1 geodesics . in this sense , those null geodesics are unstable against the introduction of an arbitrarily small @xmath0 .",
    "a key ingredient in our investigation was the use of an appropriate potential function which enabled a qualitative analysis of the geodesics system of equations . to illustrate our findings , we did numerical simulations of the full system of geodesics equations and plotted some examples which we compared with our stability results .",
    "finally , we recall that although families of spatially confined planar null geodesics were known to exist , we have found no trapped cylinders in the lt spacetime .",
    "an interesting side result of this paper is the clarification of this issue , as we have shown that the planar null geodesics which are confined are _ non - radial _ , while all outgoing _ radial _ planar null geodesics escape to infinity .    here",
    ", we did not consider the case @xmath108 . in that case",
    ", the lt metric contains a second curvature singularity and represents , at most , the gravitational field in the region between two cylindrical sources .",
    "however , although partial results have been obtained in @xcite , it is still an open problem to find a metric which can represent , simultaneously , the two sources of the @xmath108 lt spacetime .",
