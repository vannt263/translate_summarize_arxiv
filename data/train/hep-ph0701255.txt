    "the transverse spin phenomena appearing in high energy scattering processes  @xcite are among the most interesting issues of spin physics .",
    "several kinds of asymmetries associated with transverse spin have been observed .",
    "one is the single spin asymmetry in the semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ( sidis ) processes  @xcite , which requires the target nucleon to be transversely polarized .",
    "another is the @xmath0 asymmetry in the unpolarized drell - yan process  @xcite , where @xmath3 is the angle between the lepton plane and the hadron plane .",
    "it has been demonstrated that these asymmetries can be accounted for by specific leading - twist @xmath4-dependent distribution functions , i.e. , the sivers function  @xcite can explain  @xcite the single spin asymmetry in sidis processes , while the boer - mulders function  @xcite can account for  @xcite the @xmath0 asymmetry in unpolarized drell - yan processes . despite their naive time reversal - odd property  @xcite , calculations  @xcite have shown that these functions can be non - zero , due to the gauge - links  @xcite appearing in their operator definitions .",
    "the factorization theorem  @xcite involving @xmath4-dependent distribution functions has been worked out recently .",
    "sivers or boer - mulders functions correspond to a correlation between the transverse spin of the nucleon or the quark and the transverse momentum of the quark inside the nucleon , respectively .",
    "therefore , the investigation on them can provide information on the transverse spin property of the nucleon at the quark level .",
    "the experimental study of the sivers function requires an incident nucleon transversely polarized , with the advantage that this function couples with usual unpolarized distribution or fragmentation functions , and therefore it can be extracted more easily from experimental data . in the case of the boer - mulders function , it always couples with itself or another chiral - odd function in the hard scattering process .",
    "its advantage , however , is that the spin structure of hadrons can be studied without invoking beam or target polarization .",
    "in fact , the @xmath5 asymmetries due to the boer - mulders function of valence quarks have been studied theoretically for the unpolarized @xmath6  @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite drell - yan processes , which can be measured in the future pax  @xcite or compass experiments , respectively .",
    "measurements of the @xmath5 asymmetries in the unpolarized @xmath8 drell - yan process can be performed by the fnal e866/nusea collaboration and at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite .",
    "this process is dominated by the annihilation of valence and sea quarks from the two incident nucleons . in this work",
    "we will investigate the role of the boer - mulders functions of the nucleon sea , and reveal their impact on the @xmath5 asymmetries in the unpolarized @xmath8 drell - yan process .",
    "we calculate the boer - mulders functions of the intrinsic @xmath9 and @xmath10 inside the proton using a meson - baryon fluctuation model .",
    "based on the resulting sea quark boer - mulders functions , we estimate the @xmath0 asymmetries in unpolarized @xmath1 and @xmath2 drell - yan processes at e866 , and the @xmath0 asymmetries in unpolarized @xmath11 drell - yan process at rhic , respectively .",
    "the magnitude of the asymmetry is of several percent , and is sensitive to the choice of the boer - mulders functions of valence quarks .",
    "therefore the investigation of the asymmetry in the unpolarized @xmath8 processes can not only provide information on the boer - mulders functions of intrinsic sea quarks , but also on those of valence quarks .",
    "the intrinsic sea quark content of the nucleon  @xcite is important for understanding its parton structure .",
    "both experimental measurements and model calculations have shown that there is a sizable proportion of intrinsic sea quarks inside the nucleon , including @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 sea quarks , which can not be explained by the naive quark model .",
    "a qualitatively successful model that accounts for a number of significant features of the intrinsic sea quarks is the meson - baryon fluctuation model  @xcite , which is based on the light - cone fock state expansion of the nucleon .",
    "the main assumption of this model is that the intrinsic sea quarks are multi - connected to the valence quarks and can exist over a relatively long lifetime within the nucleon bound state , therefore the intrinsic @xmath15 pairs can arrange themselves together with the valence quarks of the target nucleon into the most energetically - favored meson - baryon fluctuations .",
    "it is easy to understand that the most important fluctuations are most likely to be those closest to the energy shell and thus have minimal invariant mass .",
    "such fluctuations are necessary part of any quantum - mechanical description of the hadronic bound state in qcd and have also been incorporated into the cloudy bag model and skyrme solution to chiral theories .",
    "therefore , in the meson - baryon fluctuation model , the nucleon can fluctuate into an intermediate two - body system of a baryon and a meson which are in turn composite systems of quarks and gluons .",
    "for example , the proton can fluctuate into a @xmath16 or @xmath17 configuration , and the @xmath10 or @xmath9 inside @xmath18 or @xmath19 can be viewed as @xmath10 or @xmath9 distributed in the proton .",
    "based on the meson - baryon fluctuation model one can also calculate the momentum distribution of the intrinsic sea quarks inside the proton , from the following convolution form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the probability of finding the meson @xmath22 in the @xmath23 state with light - cone momentum fraction @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the probability of finding a quark @xmath26 in the meson @xmath22 with light - cone momentum fraction @xmath27 .",
    "the function @xmath21 can be determined from the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the light - cone two - body wave function of the baryon - meson system , for which we will choose a gaussian or a power - law behavior , @xmath30 respectively . here",
    "@xmath31 is the invariant mass squared of the baryon - meson system , @xmath32 sets the characteristic internal momentum scale , and @xmath33 or @xmath34 is the normalization constant and can be fixed by @xmath35 we point out that eqs .",
    "( [ gaussian ] ) and ( [ powerlaw ] ) are boost - invariant light - cone wavefunctions which emphasize multi - parton configurations of minimal invariant mass .",
    "( [ fsea ] ) can be extended to calculate the boer - mulders functions of the intrinsic @xmath9 and @xmath10 antiquarks inside the proton ( denoted as @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "in fact , according to the meson - baryon fluctuation model , there are pion components in the intermediate state of the proton . on the other hand , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , non - zero boer - mulders functions of valence quarks inside the pion ( denoted by @xmath38 ) can been calculated using the quark - spectator - antiquark model .",
    "therefore , a convolution form similar to eq .",
    "( [ fsea ] ) can be applied to calculate @xmath36 and @xmath37 , as follows : @xmath39 the transverse momentum of the antiquark in the nucleon should be a superposition of the transverse momentum of the antiquark in the pion and of the transverse momentum of the pion in the nucleon . for simplicity we neglect here the transverse momentum of the pion . assuming that the probabilities of the proton fluctuating to @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( denoted as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively ) are both 12% , and using the functions @xmath42 given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain the numerical results for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , shown in fig .",
    "[ udbar ] .",
    "two sets of functions are given , corresponding to the choice of gaussian ( upper panel ) and power - law type ( lower panel ) wavefunctions of the meson - baryon system , respectively .",
    "the parameters used in the calculation are : @xmath45 gev , @xmath46 ( as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , perturbative qcd predicts a nominal power - law fall off at large @xmath4 corresponding to @xmath47 ) , following the choice in ref .",
    "the quark mass used in the calculation is @xmath48 gev .",
    "for the consistency here we use the same value for the mass of the quark inside the proton and the pion , which is different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite where we use 0.1 gev for the quark mass of the pion and 0.3 gev for the quark mass of the proton .",
    "this difference on the value of quark mass in the pion will bring a quantitative difference on the numerical result , but the result of the asymmetry and the main conclusion are qualitatively not changed .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the boer - mulders function of @xmath9 or @xmath10 , calculated from the gaussian type wavefunction , qualitatively agrees with that from the power - law type wave function .",
    "we should notice that this result is based on the assumption that the numbers of the sea quark pairs @xmath12 and @xmath13 inside the nucleon are the same , since we assume @xmath49 here . as we know",
    "that there should be an excess of @xmath13 pair over @xmath12 pair in the proton , which is a consequence of gottfried sum rule  @xcite , in next section we will apply another set of @xmath40 and @xmath50 , which is constrained by the existing parametrization that can produce the flavor asymmetry of the sea quarks , and investigate the consequent asymmetries in the unpolarized @xmath11 and @xmath2 drell - yan processes .",
    "boer - mulders functions for sea quarks may be obtained from other models that also allow sea quarks in the nucleon , such as the chiral quark and meson cloud models . in these models",
    "there are also @xmath51 meson components in the fock state expansion of the nucleon .",
    "in this section , we will calculate the @xmath5 asymmetries in the unpolarized @xmath1 and @xmath52 drell - yan processes , based on the boer - mulders functions of sea quarks obtained above .",

    "[ e866 ] is that the asymmetry calculated according to option i is of several percent , while that according to option ii is around one percent , indicating that the size of the asymmetry is sensitive to the choice of the boer - mulders functions of valence quarks .",
    "nevertheless , our calculation predicts a quite smaller @xmath0 asymmetry in the unpolarized @xmath85 drell - yan process compared to that in the unpolarized @xmath7 drell - yan case  @xcite .",
