    "continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum information ( qi ) is a research field that has been increasingly growing in the past few years @xcite .",
    "the need to cover larger hilbert spaces is motivated by qi protocols , such as quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , that has advantages when implemented in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "the extension of many qi protocols , first proposed considering discrete quantum systems , to the realm of cv systems has been heavily based on gaussian states @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that their covariance matrices are fully determined by the first and second order moments @xcite , and also because of the practicality in the creation , manipulation and detection of gaussian states @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , several recent works have shown the relevance of non - gaussian states and operations @xcite .",
    "for instance , they are required for quantum computation with cluster states @xcite , entanglement distillation @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite and loophole - free bell tests @xcite . besides",
    ", they provide advantages to the quantum teleportation , quantum cloning and state estimation tasks @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we show that the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) steering inequality @xcite can be used to obtain a witness for the non - gaussianity of pure bipartite cv quantum states .",
    "while the scenario require pure states , we show its broad relevance by reporting the observation of the non - gaussianity of the cv two - photon state generated in the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc)@xcite . spdc is up to date the most used source for experimental investigations in the field of quantum information , and our work highlights the simplicity of using this source for new applications in cv - qi .",
    "the generated down - converted photons are correlated in their transverse momenta and can be used to test the epr - paradox @xcite . the observed non - gaussianity is due only to the intrinsic phase - matching conditions of the spdc process @xcite , thus , highlighting the simplicity of using spdc sources for new applications of cv - qi .",
    "consider a bipartite system described by a pure cv - state @xmath0 , and a generic pair of complementary noncommuting observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with @xmath3 used to denote the operation at each subsystem .",
    "the spectral decomposition of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a infinite set of continuous variables . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was introduced the epr - steering criterion as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is is a value that depends on the chosen observables .",
    "the violation of this inequality implies the implementation of a epr - paradox @xcite .",
    "the _ inferred _ variances are given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the variance of the conditional probability distribution @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the marginal probability distribution of one party s outcomes .",
    "now , let us consider a general continuous variable two mode pure state described by a gaussian amplitude @xmath10 , where the vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the outputs of the observable @xmath13 on each party @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the widths of the corresponding gaussian functions .",
    "several cv physical systems can be modelled in this way , for example : an atomic ensemble interacting with an electromagnetic field , two entangled photons sent through gaussian channels , photoionization of atoms and photodissociation of molecules @xcite , spontaneous emission of a photon by an atom @xcite , and multiphoton pair production @xcite .",
    "since gaussian amplitudes have the same functional form in both transverse directions we can , without loss of generality , work in one dimension and consider only its scalar form .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_varinf ] ) one can obtain the limit of @xmath5 for eq .",
    "( [ gstate ] ) @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath17 .",
    "one can also find the inferred variance of the complementary observable @xmath18 , and it is given by @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the epr - steering inequality reads @xmath20 let us define one parameter @xmath21 for simplicity .",
    "the schmidt number @xmath22 for the general gaussian state of eq .",
    "( [ gstate ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath23 thus , the epr - steering inequality can be written as @xmath24 note that due to the symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ gstate ] ) one has that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 represents the schmidt number in the transverse direction @xmath27 @xcite . thus , one may further simplify the epr - steering inequality for gaussian states to @xmath28 thus , one may test it by performing the measurements in only one transverse direction .",
    "moreover , it does not depend of the values chosen for @xmath29 and @xmath30 . when @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the gaussian state is a product state . in fig .",

    "( b ) the values of @xmath34 plotted in terms of @xmath35 .",
    "[ fig1],scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "from the results obtained above it is possible to envisage a simple and practical way to determine if a certain bipartite pure state is gaussian or not .",
    "note from eq .",
    "( [ epr - gauss2 ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) that pure bipartite gaussian states will always violate the epr - steering inequality .",
    "the reason is that they are in general entangled states [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "the only exception is the point marked with the horizontal dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , which represents the point where the gaussian state is a product state . in this case",
    ", we have that @xmath37 , which corresponds to the upper quantum bound for pure bipartite gaussian states .",
    "thus , the observation of a value greater than 0.25 for @xmath34 with pure entangled states can only be achieved while considering non - gaussian states .",
    "while the scenario require pure states , now we show its broad relevance by reporting the observation of the non - gaussianity of the cv spatial two - photon state generated in the process of spdc @xcite .",
    "when perfect colinear phase - matching is considered and neglecting effects of anysotropy , we can write the spatial two - photon state as @xcite @xmath38 represents one photon in mode @xmath39 ( @xmath3 ) usually called signal or idler , and with the transverse momentum @xmath40 .",

    "@xmath43 represents the beam radius at the crystal plane .",
    "@xmath44 defines the phase - matching conditions of the spdc process , with @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is defined by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the crystal length , and @xmath49 the wavenumber of the down - converted photons . in terms of these definitions",
    ", @xmath35 reads @xmath50 .",
    "this state can be rewritten in the complementary transverse position representation as @xcite @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the fourier transform of @xmath41 and @xmath53 .",

    "the transverse position @xmath57 and transverse momentum @xmath58 are the complementary observables for the epr - steering inequality test @xcite . clearly , the cv spatial two - photon state of spdc is a non - gaussian state @xcite .",
    "an experimental observation of the effects that arise form the phase - matching conditions , namely , the non - gaussianity of @xmath59 , was reported in ref .",
    "they demonstrated how the spatial correlations in the near field plane of a non - linear crystal changes when the phase matching conditions varies .",
    "now , we demonstrate experimentally how @xmath34 can be used to detect the non - gaussianity of this state .",
    "the demonstration is based on the fact that the spatial state of spdc process is pure and entangled @xcite , even considering a post - selected one transverse direction @xcite .",
    "this means that for any value of @xmath35 , the schmidt number @xmath60 is always greater than 1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] we show @xmath61 ( @xmath34 ) with a dashed red line , while varying @xmath35 for the state @xmath59 .",
    "one can see that for some values of @xmath35 ( @xmath62 ) the values of @xmath34 are greater than @xmath63 , thus , witnessing the non - gaussianity of this state .",
    "the experimental setup is illustrated in fig .",
    "we used a solid - state laser source , at @xmath64 , to pump a @xmath65-barium - borate type - ii ( bbo - ii ) non - linear crystal ( @xmath66 ) for the generation of the down - converted photons .",
    "initially , the gaussian pump beam had a waist of @xmath67 at the crystal plane . however ,",
    "to experimentally observe the dependence of @xmath34 with @xmath35 [ see fig .  [ fig1](b ) ] , we generated five more different states by changing the waist of the beam at the crystal plane .",
    "this has been done by using a configurable set of doublet achromatic lenses placed before the non - linear crystal [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath35 for the six generated states are shown in tab .",

    ".corresponding values of @xmath35 for the generated states.[tabla1:estados ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to test the @xmath34 witness , and then certify the non - gaussian feature of the cv spatial state of spdc , we compute the variances of the conditional coincidence measurements at the near- and far - field planes for the six generated states .",
    "the results of all the conditional variances measured are shown in tab .",
    "[ tabla2:resultados ] .",
    "the errors of the variances were obtained by minimizing the squared two - norm of the residuals between the analytical and experimental results ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "for the six generated states .",
    "the continuous ( black ) line corresponds to the theoretical value of the inequality for the spatial spdc state .",
    "the dashed ( blue ) line shows the gaussian bound .",

    "the continuous ( black ) line indicate the predicted theoretical value of the inequality when we consider the spatial state of spdc .",
    "the dotted ( blue ) line is the upper limit for this inequality for gaussian states .",
    "for the first three entangled states , the values obtained for this inequality are below the gaussian limit as predicted by theory . however , for the last three entangled states , there is a clear experimental violation of this bound . due to momentum conservation , the spatial state of the spdc process is always entangled @xcite",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] and , thus , we have a clear experimental demonstration of the non - gaussianity of the cv two - photon spatial state of spdc .",
    "we have introduced a novel application for the epr - steering inequality by showing that it can be used for witnessing the non - gaussianity of cv quantum states . to demonstrated this we performed an experiment using the cv spatial state of entangled down - converted photons . due to the phase - matching conditions of the spdc process , the generated is state",
    "is naturally a pure entangled non - gaussian state . a clear violation of the gaussian bound of the epr - steering inequality has been observed .",
