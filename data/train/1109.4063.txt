    "the generation of magnetic field by the flow of an electrically conducting fluid has been mostly studied to understand the magnetic fields of planets and stars @xcite .",
    "the increase in computing power has allowed the study of these fluid dynamos in almost realistic three - dimensional geometries although far from the parameter range relevant for astrophysical or geophysical flows or even laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "three successful laboratory experiments have been performed so far : fluid dynamos have been observed with an helical ponomarenko - type flow @xcite or with a array of helical flows with the same helicity @xcite . in these two first experiments ,",
    "the flow lines were strongly constrained by the boundaries , thus restricting turbulent fluctuations to small scales , and the observed dynamos were found in very good agreement with the ones obtained by the action of the mean flow alone .",
    "a third example of fluid dynamo has been provided in the laboratory by the vks experiment , i.e. , a von krmn ( vk ) flow of liquid sodium @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the previous dynamo experiments , the geometry of the generated magnetic field strongly differs from the predictions made by kinematic dynamo codes using the mean flow alone .",
    "the mean magnetic field has to leading order a dipolar structure with its axis along the axis of rotation of the propellers that drive the flow @xcite , whereas kinematic dynamo codes using the mean flow alone predict an equatorial dipole .",
    "thus , the vks dynamo is not generated by the mean flow alone .",
    "it has been proposed that non axisymmetric fluctuations related to the propellers driving the flow play a crucial role in the generation of an axial dipolar magnetic field @xcite and this mechanism has been illustrated by a kinematic dynamo simulation using a non axisymmetric model flow in a cylindrical geometry @xcite .",
    "two different choices can be made for the numerical simulations of dynamos .",
    "one possibility is to consider a flow confined in a finite domain and to use boundary conditions as realistic as possible .",
    "another one is to use periodic boundary conditions on the velocity and magnetic fields . in the later case ,",
    "the taylor - green ( tg ) flow has been widely studied .",
    "the tg vortex is a standard turbulent flow often used in numerical computations @xcite that is closely related to the experimentally studied vk swirling flow @xcite .",
    "the relation between the vk flow and the tg vortex is a similarity in overall geometry : a shear layer between two counter - rotating eddies . the tg vortex , however , is periodic with impermeable free - slip boundaries ( present as mirror symmetries ) while the experimental flow takes place between two counter - rotating coaxial impellers and is confined inside a cylindrical container .",
    "the tg vortex also obeys a number of additional rotational symmetries .",
    "dynamo action in the tg flow was studied some time ago @xcite and it was found that the most unstable growing magnetic mode is equatorial ( perpendicular to the axis of rotation ) and breaks the additional rotational symmetries . thus enforcing all the geometric symmetries of the tg flow was found to be non - favorable to dynamo action . since that time all numerical studies of dynamo action in the tg vortex were performed using general periodic codes ( not enforcing any of the symmetries ) .",
    "the generated magnetic field was always found to be equatorial @xcite .",
    "the new idea that we explore in the present paper is to enforce the mirror symmetries of the tg flow ( that confine the flow ) but not enforce the rotational symmetries of the magnetic field ( that forbid the appearance of magnetic dipoles ) . with mirror symmetries enforced ,",
    "the corresponding boundary conditions on the magnetic field can be related to either electrically insulating ] or perfectly conducting boundaries @xcite . in the present case ( without the rotational symmetries )",
    "there are @xmath0 possibilities for the magnetic boundaries conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after recalling the mhd equations and the tg forcing , we present the symmetries of the tg flow in section [ sec : tgsymetries ] . we show that there exists only one choice of mirror symmetry for the velocity field that is compatible with the equations of motion .",
    "it corresponds to free - slip boundary conditions on each boundary of the cube @xmath1 ^ 3 $ ] . in contrast , in each directions two independent choices exist for the magnetic field , either corresponding to an electrically insulating boundary , or to a perfectly conducting boundary .",
    "we show that we can always restrict the kinematic dynamo study in a symmetric subspace and that there are six different cases to consider .",
    "in section [ sec : symdyn ] we first shortly describe the numerical procedures and explain how the growth rates of the different dynamo modes are determined .",
    "then , we consider how the imposed symmetries on the velocity field affect the dynamo threshold .",
    "we show that in the absence of constraints , the flow can spontaneously break the tg forcing symmetries , thus generating turbulent fluctuations that inhibit dynamo action although involving larger kinetic energy . in section [ sec : bceffect ] , we consider the different symmetry constraints for the magnetic field and their respective dynamo efficiency .",
    "we show that the lower threshold is obtained when lateral boundaries are of different nature ( two conducting and two insulating ) .",
    "in addition , the lowest threshold is obtained when the upper and lower ones are insulating . in this case , the threshold value and the neutral mode geometry correspond to the ones already reported in a general periodic code without symmetry constraints @xcite .",
    "we observe that the geometry of the dynamo modes strongly depends on the symmetry constraints that are chosen .",
    "with all boundaries electrically insulating , we obtain the generation of an axial dipolar magnetic field , as the one observed in the vks experiment",
    ". the nonlinear saturation of this axial dipole is studied in section [ sec : saturation ] where we also present a simple model explaining the super / sub critical nature of the dynamo transition when the magnetic prandtl number is varied .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations for an unit density fluid and an incompressible flow read in terms of the velocity @xmath2 and magnetic induction @xmath3 ( in units of alfvn velocity ) : @xmath4 together with @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the current density , @xmath7 is the pressure , @xmath8 is the mechanical forcing , @xmath9 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath10 is the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the total energy is @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the kinetic energy , @xmath13 is the magnetic energy and @xmath14 stands for spatial average over the domain ) .",
    "the total energy is conserved by these equations in the ideal case ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .    considering a flow that is @xmath17-periodic in all spatial dimensions , the kinematic reynolds number @xmath18 and the magnetic reynolds number @xmath19",
    "are defined as @xmath20 where the root - mean square velocity is @xmath21 and the characteristic length @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 where the kinetic energy spectrum @xmath24 ( such that @xmath25 ) is obtained by summing @xmath26 on the spherical shells @xmath27",
    "( @xmath28 is the fourier transform of the velocity ) .",
    "analogously , the magnetic energy spectrum is denoted by @xmath29 and verifies @xmath30 .",
    "the magnetic prandtl number of the fluid is given by @xmath31 .",
    "we now turn to the definition of the external driving volumic force @xmath32 in that balances the energy dissipation and allows to reach a statistically stationary state that is needed to sustain dynamo action . following reference @xcite ,",
    "we force the system by setting in @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the taylor - green @xcite initial data @xmath35 and @xmath36 is determined by imposing that the projection of @xmath2 on the mode @xmath34 is fixed at all times to its initial value .    in the navier - stokes problem ( eq . , with @xmath37 ) is well - known @xcite that a number of the symmetries of @xmath34 are compatible with the equations of motion .",
    "they are , first , rotational symmetries of angle @xmath38 around the axis @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; and of angle @xmath41 around the axis @xmath42 .",
    "another set of symmetries corresponds to planes of mirror symmetry : @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 that form the sides of the so - called impermeable box which confines the flow .",
    "however , it is important to note that the tg symmetries of the solution can be _ spontaneously broken _",
    ", in the sense that a small non - symmetric component of the initial data can grow and eventually break the symmetry of the solution @xcite",
    ". the symmetry breaking of the tg flow will be numerically studied in sec.[sec : symbreaking ] .",
    "the main new idea of the present paper is to enforce the mirror symmetries of the tg flow ( that confine the flow ) but not enforce the rotational symmetries of the magnetic field ( that forbid the appearance of magnetic dipoles ) .",
    "with mirror symmetries enforced , the corresponding boundary conditions on the magnetic field can be related to either electrically insulating or perfectly conducting boundaries @xcite ( see the discussion at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : decompsym ] ) . in the present case ( without the rotational symmetries )",
    "it will turn out that there are new ( mixed ) possibilities for the magnetic boundaries conditions .",
    "we now proceed to explore all the tg mirror symmetries that are dynamically compatible with the full mhd equations ( [ eq : mhdv]-[eq : mhdb ] ) .",
    "the mhd equations ( [ eq : mhdv]-[eq : mhdb ] ) are invariant under reflections with respect to a plane .",
    "we now turn to considerations pertaining to this propriety .",
    "let us first define the standard reflection transformation of the vector @xmath46 about the plane @xmath47 by @xmath48 with @xmath49 note that @xmath48 is its own inverse .",
    "the action of the reflection operation on a vector field @xmath50 is defined by @xmath51 which explicitly reads , in the case of the the @xmath52 plane : @xmath53 we will say that the vector field @xmath54 has a mirror - symmetry with respect to the plane @xmath55 if it is even ( @xmath56 ) or odd ( @xmath57 ) under transformation .",
    "note that if a vector field is even ( odd ) with respect to a plane , then it is perpendicular ( parallel ) to that plane . when a vector field that is odd ( or even ) with respect to simultaneous transformations with respect to all planes , it is said that it transforms as a _ vector _ ( or _ pseudo - vector _ ) .",
    "note that the taylor - green vortex is odd with respect to all planes : @xmath58 for all @xmath59 .",
    "the following properties are true for any fields @xmath60 and @xmath54 @xmath61    from eq .",
    "it is directly observed that if @xmath54 is even with respect to a plane then @xmath62 is odd with respect to that plane and vice versa .",
    "we now turn to study the mirror symmetries of the mhd equations .",
    "applying @xmath63 to ( [ eq : mhdv]-[eq : mhdb ] ) and writing @xmath64 , it directly follows from eqs.([eq : propapp1],[eq : propapp2],[eq : propapp3 ] ) that @xmath65 and @xmath66 satisfy @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "therefore the only symmetry of the velocity that is compatible with the mhd equations ( [ eq : mhdv]-[eq : mhdb ] ) is @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this can be easily understood with the following simple geometrical argument based on vortex rings that are known to have a self - induced motion along their axis .",
    "suppose that there exist a symmetry plane containing a vortex ring , for such a configuration the vorticity is parallel to the plane .",
    "the related velocity field is thus an even field with respect to that plane .",
    "it is immediately noticed that the symmetry will not be preserved by the navier - stokes equation : the vortex ring will leave the plane under it s self - induced motion thus breaking the symmetry .",
    "another possibility is to place the vortex ring perpendicular to the plane , making the velocity parallel , therefore odd with respect to that plane .",
    "the self - induced motion will then respect the symmetry .",
    "note however that the magnetic field must be symmetric but it can be either even or odd . therefore , for a mirror symmetric velocity field , the magnetic field has two possible symmetries for each plane that are compatible with the mhd equations .",
    "we will see below that the two possibilities correspond to insulating ( i ) and perfectly conducting ( c ) magnetic boundary conditions ( of the free - slip type ) for the even and odd cases respectively .",
    "note that , as the the fields are defined in a @xmath71-periodical box , the planes @xmath72 and @xmath73 are also mirror symmetry planes with the same symmetries than @xmath74 and @xmath52 . in the following , depending on the symmetries of the magnetic field , we will refer to these planes as walls of type i ( even ) or c ( odd ) . with this definition ,",
    "the symmetry planes of the taylor - green vortex are of type ccc ( vorticity is perpendicular to the box @xmath75 ^ 3 $ ] ) .      let us now define the projectors into symmetric functions with respect to the planes @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 where @xmath59 stands for @xmath79 , @xmath63 is defined by eq . and",
    "note that by construction @xmath81 and therefore @xmath82 is an even vector ( if @xmath83 ) or odd vector ( @xmath84 ) with respect to the planes @xmath47 and @xmath85 .",
    "as the above discussion about the two possible magnetic mirror symmetries was done for each plane @xmath47 independently , we now define the projector over the most general mirror - symmetric magnetic fields corresponding to a different choice for each plane .",
    "@xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "note that by construction @xmath88    let us now consider a completely mirror - symmetric @xmath71-periodical velocity field . with this choice @xmath89",
    "is confined into the impermeable box @xmath75 ^ 3 $ ] : there is no flow crossing the boundaries .",
    "this mimics the rigid boundary conditions of experiments that are also impermeable .",
    "we now explain how the different kinds of magnetic symmetries are related to perfectly conducting and insulating boundary conditions .",
    "if the magnetic field is even with respect to one of the mirror - symmetry planes , we call this plane a _ insulating _ ( i ) wall because the current @xmath90 is parallel to ( or contained in ) the wall @xcite .",
    "analogously if @xmath91 is odd the wall is called _ conducting _ ( the current is perpendicular to ( or crosses ) the wall .    we now show that any @xmath71-periodical magnetic field can be decomposed in a finite sum of mixed symmetrical - periodical vector and pseudo - vector fields that correspond respectively to insulating and perfectly conducting magnetic boundary conditions .",
    "thus the complete study of the influence of symmetries ( boundary conditions ) on the tg dynamo threshold is reduced to a finite number of possible cases .",
    "let @xmath92 be the space of @xmath71-periodic functions , and @xmath93 the projection of @xmath92 over the subspaces with mirror symmetries given by @xmath94 .",
    "for example if @xmath95 , then @xmath96 is normal to the planes @xmath52 and @xmath73 and parallel to the other ones .",
    "therefore @xmath97 is the @xmath71-periodical function space such that the planes @xmath98 are _ insulating _ and the planes @xmath99 are _",
    "it can be demonstrated by straightforward ( but tedious ) computations that @xmath100 we thus have that @xmath92 decomposes as the direct sum @xmath101 and therefore the general - periodic function space is then decomposed in eight mirror - symmetric periodical - function spaces . for the sake of clarity , in the following we will denote each space @xmath102 by its respective type of walls .",
    "for instance the case @xmath97 is labeled iic .",
    "the kinematic dynamo is the linear instability of the mhd equations linearized about a given velocity field @xmath103 . for a stationary @xmath103",
    ", the growth rate @xmath104 of the magnetic field is given by the eigenvalue problem @xmath105 with @xmath106 observe that the eigenvalue @xmath104 depends on @xmath10 and thus is a function of @xmath107 ( see eq . ) .",
    "the dynamo threshold is defined by the critical magnetic reynolds number @xmath108 such that @xmath109 .",
    "note that this number is not necessary unique due to windows of instability @xcite .",
    "in this work we refer to @xmath108 as the smallest critical magnetic reynolds number .    as a consequence of the symmetry invariance of the mhd eqs.([eq : mhdv]-[eq : mhdb ] ) , it is straightforfard to show that the symmetry projectors @xmath110 commute with @xmath111",
    ". therefore if @xmath112 is an eigenvector associated to the eigenvalue @xmath113 , by the decomposition of the identity , there exist one symmetry @xmath114 such that @xmath115 is also a eigenvector associated to @xmath113 .",
    "we thus have for the threshold of general - periodic dynamo @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the critical magnetic reynolds number of the linear problem restricted to @xmath118 .",
    "in other words , a bifurcating mode of the magnetic field has a certain mirror - symmetry .",
    "it is thus natural to study the dynamo bifurcation for each symmetry by restricting to each @xmath118 .",
    "this can be easily done if each mirror - symmetry is imposed to the magnetic field by applying the projectors @xmath119 .    since the forcing is invariant by rotation of @xmath41 along the @xmath120 axis , the spaces ici and icc",
    "are respectively equivalent to cii and cic .",
    "there are thus only six independent cases to study .",
    "the symmetries iii , ccc , iic , cci , ici and icc will be individually studied in sec.[sec : bceffect ] .",
    "note that we are dealing throughout this paper with periodic fields , with physical boundaries being replaced by symmetry planes .",
    "in contrast , in the case of a physical fluid confined into a finite domain a magnetic field at an insulating boundary should be matched with a potential field outside the flow domain .",
    "the case that we call `` insulating '' also mimics a boundary with a magnetic permeability much larger than that of the fluid , _ i.e. _ liquid sodium inside an iron vessel . in that case matching with a potential field is not required and the magnetic field is perpendicular to the boundaries .",
    "numerical solutions of eqs.([eq : mhdv]-[eq : mhdb ] ) are efficiently produced using the pseudospectral general - periodic code ghost @xcite , that is dealiased by spherical spectral truncation using the @xmath121-rule @xcite .",

    ". this condition ( called spectral convergence ) is quantitatively determined by fitting the exponential decay of the energy spectra @xmath24 and @xmath29 by a law of the form @xmath127 that amounts to a simple lin - log linear regression .",

    "this claim probably results from several anti - dynamo theorems that have been found since cowling who showed that an axisymmetric velocity field can not generate an axisymmetric magnetic field ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the magnetic field should break axisymmetry when generated through dynamo action by an axisymmetric velocity field .",
    "another class of anti - dynamo theorems is even more restrictive and forbids the dynamo action of some velocity fields ( for instance planar flows , _",
    "i.e. _ velocity fields with only two non zero cartesian components ) whatever the geometry of the generated magnetic field .      - symmetry constraints on the velocity field can lead to lower dynamo threshold by inhibiting the development of hydrodynamic instabilities and related turbulent fluctuations that sometimes reduce the efficiency of dynamo action ,      it has been shown that the dynamo threshold @xmath149 of the tg flow , increases when the kinetic reynolds number of the flow is increased on some intermediate range , and this has been related to the development of turbulent fluctuations @xcite . using symmetry constraints on the velocity field",
    "shows that phenomenon without ambiguity : the level of turbulent fluctuations is lower with the symmetric velocity field and , correspondingly , the dynamo threshold is lower too , although the mean kinetic energy is larger for the velocity field without symmetries .",
    "this shows in a simple and clear - cut way that velocity fluctuations inhibit dynamo action by the tg flow .",
    "the same phenomenon has been shown analytically for the dynamo generated by a fluctuating roberts flow @xcite .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that a time - dependent velocity can also generate new dynamo modes that do not exist in the absence of fluctuations .",
    "we have also shown that symmetry constraints on the magnetic field can be used to mimic realistic boundary conditions in the framework of numerical simulations with periodic codes .",
    "it was found that the dynamo threshold and the geometry of the growing magnetic mode strongly depend on the choice of symmetry constraints , and thus on the related boundary conditions .",
    "the lowest dynamo threshold was obtained with lateral boundaries of different nature , allowing a magnetic field to cross the box perpendicularly to the current ( ici case ) .",
    "this case , where the dominant component is an equatorial dipole , strongly reminds the geometry of the magnetic field that was numerically generated by using the mean flow measured in a vk geometry with counter - rotating propellers @xcite .",
    "this emphasizes the similarity between vk and tg flows .",
    "note however that the mean flow component in the vk geometry is axisymmetric and can not drive an axisymmetric magnetic field because of cowling s theorem . a magnetic field with an equatorial dipolar component provides a simple way to break axisymmetry .",
    "in contrast , the tg forcing is not axisymmetric and thus does not enforce such a strong constraint on the generated magnetic field . indeed ,",
    "when symmetry constraints related to infinite magnetic permeability are implemented for all boundaries ( iii case ) , the generated magnetic field involves a dominant component which is an axial dipole .",
    "this corresponds to the geometry of the magnetic field generated in the vks experiment , where it was ascribed to the presence of non - axisymmetric velocity fluctuations @xcite .",
    "direct numerical simulations of dynamos generated by an axisymmetric @xmath231 forcing in a sphere , a configuration similar to the vk forcing , have shown that an equatorial dipole is observed at low @xmath18 , for which the flow is axisymmetric , whereas an axial dipole is obtained at higher @xmath18 , i.e. in the presence of non - axisymmetric velocity fluctuations @xcite .",
    "we observe that the tg forcing provides a different scenario : the axial dipole does not seem to be favored by turbulent fluctuations ( compare fig . [",
    "fig : sigmabsym30 ] a and b ) .",
    "thus , slight deviations from axisymmetry , present in the tg forcing , are enough to generate a magnetic field with a dominant axial dipolar component , even at small @xmath18 , provided appropriate boundary conditions are simulated .    finally , we have studied the nonlinear saturation of the axial dipolar magnetic field ( iii case ) . we have observed that the dynamo bifurcation can be subcritical in some parameter range .",
    "we have shown that this phenomenon can be explained by the presence of an hydrodynamic instability that competes with the growing magnetic mode .",
    "this is not unlikely for @xmath230 of order @xmath163 which is the case of most numerical simulations and provides a general mechanism for subcritical dynamos .",
    "it would be of interest to check whether the subcritical dynamo bifurcations reported previously in non confined tg flows @xcite , flows forced in a sphere @xcite or simulations of the geodynamo @xcite , are also related to a similar mechanism .",
    "other open questions concern the dynamics of the magnetic field above the dynamo threshold . breaking the symmetry of the tg flow in order to generate reversals of the axial dipole or other dynamics resulting from nonlinear coupling between different magnetic modes deserve to be studied ."
