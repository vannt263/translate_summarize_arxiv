    "of the more than 130 different molecules found in interstellar space , an important class is formed by the unsaturated carbonaceous species .",
    "carbohydrides ranging from small molecules such as c@xmath2h @xcite to long chains like c@xmath6h @xcite and hc@xmath7n @xcite have been detected through their millimeter transitions in cold dark clouds like tmc-1 for several decades .",
    "some of these molecules have also been seen in their cyclic form , with c - c@xmath0h@xmath2 as the best - known example @xcite .",
    "even negative ions , in particular c@xmath8h@xmath9 , have now been detected @xcite .",
    "bare carbon chains are likely present as well but do not have a permanent dipole moment and can therefore not be observed through their pure rotational transitions in emission . instead , the smallest members of this family , c@xmath2 and c@xmath0 , have been detected in diffuse interstellar clouds , i.e . , clouds which are not completely opaque to visible and ultraviolet radiation through their electronic absorptions against bright background stars @xcite .",
    "@xmath4c@xmath0h@xmath2 has been seen in diffuse clouds as well , through absorption at radio wavelengths against background quasars @xcite .",
    "the relatively large abundances of these non - saturated molecules , in spite of the fact that there is @xmath10 times more hydrogen than carbon in interstellar clouds , are a vivid demonstration that interstellar chemistry is not in thermodynamic equilibrium . instead",
    ", the kinetics of the reactions that form and destroy these molecules need to be taken into account explicitly in order to explain their abundances . in cold dark clouds ,",
    "these traditionally involve a series of ion - molecule and neutral - neutral reactions @xcite .",
    "more recently , several of the carbohydrides c@xmath11h@xmath12 have also been observed in so - called photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) @xcite , i.e. , clouds which are exposed to intense ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation .",
    "species like c@xmath2h and c - c@xmath0h@xmath2 have been detected in the orion bar pdr @xcite and even more complex molecules like c@xmath0h@xmath2 and c@xmath1h have been seen in the horsehead nebula , m38 @xcite . together with the above mentioned observations of diffuse clouds , the data demonstrate that these molecules can exist in uv - exposed environments with abundances comparable to those in cold dark clouds .",
    "traditional pdr chemical models can not explain the high abundances of these molecules , leading to speculations that they are perhaps produced by fragmentation of even larger carbonaceous molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) @xcite .",
    "however , a major uncertainty in these and other models are the photodissociation rates of the carbohydrides , which are basically unknown .    other regions in which ultraviolet photons play a role in the chemistry include the envelopes of evolved stars and cometary atmospheres .",
    "the same carbohydride molecules have been detected in the envelope of the carbon - rich late - type star irc+10216 , where their similar distributions are a puzzle for photochemical models @xcite . in cometary atmospheres ,",
    "species as complex as c@xmath1h have been inferred , whose presence is not readily explained by the standard parent - daughter photochemical models @xcite .",
    "many theoretical studies of the electronic structure of small carbohydride molecules exist in the literature ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) .",
    "however , most of them are limited to the ground and lowest few excited electronic states .",
    "only few studies of higher states exist , most of them performed by peyerimhoff and her co - workers starting more than 30 years ago , e.g. , @xcite as will be shown here , those results are still highly relevant and provide an excellent starting point for further studies .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide insight into the photodissociation processes of carbohydride molecules through _ ab initio _ quantum chemical calculations of the vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths for as large a number of excited electronic states as feasible with current programs . by assuming that most of the absorptions with energies above the dissociation limit lead to destruction , estimates of the ( upper limits of ) photodissociation rates under interstellar conditions can be obtained .",
    "even though such calculations are necessarily limited to the smaller members of the carbo - hydride family , they do provide quantitative constraints to test the basic interstellar chemical networks .",
    "specifically , c@xmath2h , c@xmath0 , c@xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath4c@xmath0h , @xmath3 and @xmath4 c@xmath0h@xmath2 , hc@xmath0h , @xmath3c@xmath1h and @xmath3c@xmath5h are studied here . except for hc@xmath0h",
    ", all these species have been chosen to have been observed in interstellar space .",
    "for small diatomic and triatomic molecules , quantum chemical calculations of the potential energy surfaces and transition dipole moments combined with dynamical calculations of the nuclear motions can provide photodissociation cross sections and oscillator strengths that agree with experiments to better than 2030% , e.g. , @xcite ( see @xcite for an early review ) .",
    "for the polyatomic molecules considered here , calculations of the full potential surfaces including all degrees of freedom become very time consuming , as do the multi - dimensional dynamics .",
    "moreover , such detail is not needed in order to compute photorates , since those are largely determined by the potentials and transition moments in the franck - condon region .",
    "the simplest alternative is therefore to only compute the vertical excitation energies and transition dipole moment of the molecule at its equilibrium position and assume a certain probability that absorption into each excited state above the dissociation limit leads to dissociation . for the examples cited above",
    ", such an approach leads to similar rates within the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "the focus of our calculations is therefore on electric dipole - allowed transitions to states lying above the lowest dissociation limit but below 13.6 ev .",
    "the interstellar radiation field has a broad spectrum from visible to extreme ultraviolet wavelengths , peaking in intensity around 7 ev and cutting off at the atomic h ionization potential at 13.6 ev @xcite .",
    "all calculations presented here were performed with the wuppertal - bonn mrdci set of programs as implemented in the gamess - uk program package version 7.0 @xcite . for c ,",
    "the tzvp atomic orbital basis set was used , and for h , the dzp basis set @xcite . to allow for a proper description of molecular rydberg states , two diffuse @xmath13 and two diffuse @xmath14 functions",
    "were put on specific sites . for c@xmath2 and c@xmath2h , this was the middle of the cc bond ; for c@xmath2 and c@xmath1h the middle of the c1-c2 and c3-c4 bonds ; for c@xmath0 , @xmath3c@xmath0h , @xmath3c@xmath0h@xmath2 and hc@xmath0h the middle c ; for c@xmath5 on c2 and c4 ; for @xmath4c@xmath0h on the c connected to h ; and for @xmath4c@xmath0h@xmath2 on the lone c. these sites were chosen to avoid linear dependencies in the atomic orbital basis set due to large overlap of diffuse functions positioned on adjacent atoms .",
    "cartesian @xmath14 functions were used , of which the spherical component served as the @xmath15 basis function .",
    "molecular orbitals were generated using up to the maximum number of reference states , 255 .",
    "the selection threshold was generally set at 0.5 @xmath16hartree . the total number of configurations included in the configuration interaction ( ci ) calculation ranged from 200000400000 per symmetry .",
    "the sum over the coefficients - squared in the final ci wave function is typically 0.95 for the smaller species , dropping to 0.9 for the larger molecules .",
    "the ci energies were extrapolated and corrected using the davidson extrapolation @xcite .",
    "the aim was to compute as many excited electronic states as feasible , up to 9 per symmetry .",
    "for the lower states , comparison with existing calculations and experiments indicates accuracies within 0.3 ev , generally better .",
    "oscillator strengths to the lower states agree within 30% or better . for the higher states , typically the 5th root and higher per symmetry",
    ", the accuracy decreases because many states and orbitals can mix .",
    "nevertheless , such calculations should still provide insight into the location of those states , in particular whether they are above or below the ionization potential and below the 13.6 ev cutoff of the interstellar radiation field",
    ". moreover , the magnitude of the oscillator strengths ( strong or weak ) should be reliable .",
    "note that the precise values of the excitation energies are not so important for the purposes of calculating interstellar photorates because of the broad range of incident energies .",
    "the only exception is possible overlap with lyman @xmath17 radiation at 10.2 ev , which is important for certain astrophysical environments @xcite .    in all calculations ,",
    "the largest abelian subgroup of the full @xmath18 group , @xmath19 , was used , with the molecule put along the @xmath20axis .",
    "the doubly degenerate states are then split into the @xmath21 and @xmath22 irreducible representations for @xmath23 and @xmath24 states , and into @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the @xmath27 states . in general , the degeneracies for the @xmath27 states are recovered within a few hundreds of an ev in the calculations . the average of the two @xmath25 and @xmath26 values is tabulated here . the @xmath25 irreducible representation also contains the @xmath28 states , and the @xmath26 the @xmath29 states .",
    "some excited states with electronic angular momentum higher than 2 ( in particular @xmath24 states ) are also found in our calculations but they are not tabulated here since the electric dipole transition moments from the ground state to these states are zero , implying that they do not contribute to photodissociation . the valence or rydberg character of the states is determined from calculations of the @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 expectation values .",
    "calculations have been limited to the equilibrium geometry corresponding to the lowest energy .",
    "for c@xmath0 , c@xmath2h , c@xmath1 , c@xmath1h and c@xmath5h this is the linear geometry .",
    "c@xmath0h and c@xmath0h@xmath2 have been detected in various isomeric forms so both cyclic and ( near-)linear forms have been studied .",
    "the dissociation energies for c@xmath11h are calculated as the difference between the ground state energy of c@xmath11h at its equilibrium geometry and the energy of ground state c@xmath11 , also at its equilibrium geometry , calculated in the presence of an h atom positioned at a distance of 20 bohr from the center of mass . in this way",
    "the errors associated with the lack of size consistency are significantly reduced .",
    "note that the spatial symmetry of the molecule and the fragment generally differs .",
    "oscillator strengths to all excited states have been calculated according to @xmath33 where all quantities are in atomic units ( a.u . ) , @xmath34 is the transition dipole moment from lower state @xmath35 to upper state @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is a degeneracy factor which is 2 for a @xmath38 transitions and 1 for any other transition . for linear molecules , the dipole moment operator contained in @xmath34",
    "corresponds to @xmath39 for transitions between states with the same value of the electronic angular momentum projection quantum number @xmath40 and to @xmath41 for transitions with @xmath42 .",
    "the computed excitation energies @xmath43 were used in this formula , not any experimental values .",
    "hence , differences with other work can stem from differences in both @xmath34 and in @xmath44 .",
    "the photodissociation rate of a molecule can be computed from @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the photodissociation cross section in @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the mean intensity of the radiation in photons @xmath49",
    "s@xmath50 @xmath50 @xcite . under interstellar conditions ,",
    "only single photon processes are important . for photodissociation initiated by line absorptions ( e.g. , predissociation ) , the rate becomes @xmath51 where @xmath52 the dissociation efficiency of state @xmath36 , which lies between 0 and 1 .",
    "the numerical value of the factor @xmath53 is @xmath54 in the adopted units with @xmath55 in  .",
    "the total photodissociation rate of a molecule is obtained by summing over all channels . in this work ,",
    "no dynamical calculations are performed to obtain continuous cross sections for dissociative states .",
    "hence , all photorates are computed with eq .  ( 3 ) .",
    "it is furthermore assumed that the dissociation efficiency @xmath52=1 , either through direct dissociation in a repulsive state or by predissociation .",
    "the motivation for this choice is that for larger molecules , internal conversion to a lower ( dissociative ) electronic state is usually much more rapid than any radiative decay rates owing to the high density of states @xcite .",
    "specific experimental evidence of high dissociation efficiencies will be presented in the results section for individual molecules .",
    "the c@xmath2h radical , detected in interstellar clouds since 1974 @xcite , is an important step in the formation of longer carbon chains . in comets",
    ", it could be a photodissociation product of c@xmath2h@xmath2 and a precursor of the widely observed c@xmath2 molecule .",
    "given also its importance in combustion processes , this radical has received ample theoretical attention , starting with the papers by shih , peyerimhoff and co - workers @xcite and culminating with the more recent two - dimensional potential surfaces by duflot et al .",
    "@xcite .    as a test of our computational procedure , we present in table  [ tabc2h ] our computed vertical excitation energies , oscillator strengths and the main configurations of each state .",
    "our energies generally agree well within 0.3 ev with those of koures and harding @xcite ( their ci + dv2 results ) and lie in between those of duflot et al .",
    "@xcite and shih et al .",
    "close inspection shows that the larger differences are usually for states with rydberg character ( which are not included in duflot et al .",
    "@xcite ) or for states with a strong interaction with a neighboring state , leading sometimes even to a switch in the character of the state . for example",
    ", the 4@xmath56 state in our calculation has rydberg @xmath57 character whereas it has ...",
    "@xmath58 in duflot et al . , resulting also in a very different transition dipole moment ( see below ) .    our computed @xmath59 transition dipole moment of 0.22 a.u",
    ".  is very close to that of 0.23 a.u .  computed by duflot et al",
    ". @xcite and peric et al . @xcite .",
    "because of the slightly higher excitation energy in our work , the oscillator strengths show somewhat larger differences .",
    "comparison for other states is difficult since duflot et al",
    ".  do not give any numerical values .",
    "however , their figure 7 shows that neither the 3 and 4 @xmath56 , nor the 2 and 3 @xmath60 states have significant transition dipole moment .",
    "this is generally consistent with our results . for the 5@xmath56 state",
    "we find a huge transition dipole moment of 1.1 a.u .  due to the rydberg character of our wavefunction .",
    "thus , this state around 10 ev will dominate the interstellar c@xmath2h photodissociation but the higher @xmath60 states in the 8.510.5 ev range can also contribute significantly up to the ionization potential of @xmath6111.4 ev ( table  [ tabdiss ] ) .",
    "the c@xmath0 molecule was detected in cometary spectra in 1882 through its @xmath62 system at 4050   @xcite and in interstellar clouds more than a century later @xcite .",
    "the molecule is also seen in the atmospheres of cool carbon stars through its mid - infrared @xcite and far - infrared @xcite transitions ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "c@xmath0 is a linear molecule with a ground x@xmath63 state .",
    "its dissociation energy is computed to be about 4.6 ev , whereas its ionization energy is around 12 ev ( table  [ tabdiss ] ) .",
    "quantum chemical studies range from the early work by chabalowski et al.@xcite to the recent calculations by terentyev et al .",
    "table  [ tabc3 ] summarizes our computed excitation energies , together with the oscillator strengths and main configurations . for the low - lying valence states ,",
    "our results agree to better than 0.3 ev with the mr - aqcc values of monninger et al.@xcite .",
    "these results also show that the @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) transition at 8.17 ev has by far the largest oscillator strength , as predicted first by pitzer and clementi @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by the combined experimental and theoretical study by monninger et al.@xcite whose 11005600   spectrum demonstrates that the @xmath66 transition around 1700   is indeed the strongest band .",
    "their experiments in ne and ar matrices show a broad band but with some progressions superposed , which are evidence for interstate vibronic coupling with adjacent @xmath67 states .",
    "indeed , the @xmath68 state is predicted to be unstable to bending , leading to avoided crossings with the lower - lying @xmath67 states @xcite .",
    "these interactions can also lead to dissociative channels to produce c@xmath2 + c.      both linear and cyclic c@xmath0h have been detected in the interstellar medium by their transitions at millimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the @xmath60 ground state of @xmath3c@xmath0h lies about 0.40.6 ev above the @xmath69 ground state of @xmath4c@xmath0h @xcite , with a small barrier toward the cyclic state .",
    "hence , when c@xmath0h is produced in its linear form by some sequence of ion molecule or other chemical processes , it can be stable , and both isomers are therefore considered in this work .",

    "the sum over the other states is comparable .",
    "thus , there appear to be many potential routes to photodissociation for @xmath4c@xmath0h .",
    "cyclopropenylidene , @xmath4c@xmath0h@xmath2 , was the first cyclic molecule to be detected in the interstellar medium @xcite and subsequently found to be ubiquitous throughout the galaxy , even in diffuse gas @xcite .",
    "the near - linear form hccch ( propargylene ) , denoted here as hc@xmath0h , lies 0.40.8 ev higher in energy @xcite , depending whether the zero - point vibrational energy is included .",
    "since it has a near - zero dipole moment , it has not yet been observed in interstellar clouds through radio transitions but is likely present as well .",
    "there are various other stable isomers of c@xmath0h@xmath2 , of which another linear form , h@xmath2ccc ( vinylidenecarbene or propadienylidene ) , denoted here as @xmath3c@xmath0h@xmath2 , was discovered in interstellar space in 1991 @xcite .",

    "the equilibrium coordinates in our calculations were taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "table  [ tabc5h ] summarizes our results .",
    "comparison with haubrich et al .",
    "@xcite shows excellent agreement in both energies and oscillator strengths , except for the higher - lying @xmath56 states .",
    "this difference is likely due to the explicit inclusion of rydberg states in our work .",
    "for the 3 and 4 @xmath60 states , the oscillator strengths differ by a factor of 2 but these states show considerable interaction between the @xmath105 and @xmath106 @xmath107 excitations .",
    "differences in mixing ratios can lead to large changes in transition dipole moments to individual states , but not in energies .",
    "the computed excitation energies for the lowest two excited states also agree well with those measured and computed by ding et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the threshold for photodissociation lies around 3.6 ev ( table  [ tabdiss ] ) . of the dipole - allowed transitions below the ionization potential at 7.4 ev , both the 4 @xmath60 ( @xmath108 ) state at 4.2 ev and the 6 @xmath60 ( @xmath109 state around 6.1 ev have large oscillator strengths .",
    "all other states have typical oscillator strengths of a few @xmath110 and thus contribute at a lower level .",
    "in table  [ tabisrates ] , the computed photodissociation rates in the unshielded interstellar radiation field cf .",
    "draine @xcite are presented , using the oscillator strengths given in tables  [ tabc2h ] to [ tabc5h ] and asuming @xmath52=1 for all states .",
    "thus , these rates should be regarded as upper limits .",
    "only states above the dissociation limit and below the ionization potential have been taken into account ( see table  [ tabdiss ] for adopted values ) .",
    "no corrections have been made for possible higher - lying states below the ionization limit not computed in this work . since the oscillator strengths for rydberg states decrease roughly as @xmath111 , it is assumed that any such corrections would be small since the lowest rydberg members are calculated explicitly . for reference ,",
    "inclusion of a hypothetical state at 9 ev with an oscillator strength of 0.1 would increase the photodissociation rates by only @xmath112 s@xmath50 .    for c@xmath2h ,",
    "our new rate is a factor of 3 larger than that given in van dishoeck et al .",
    "@xcite , which was based on the energies and oscillator strengths of shih et al . @xcite . the increase is mostly due to the higher @xmath56 and @xmath60 states which were not computed in that work . for c@xmath0 ,",
    "the new rate is only 30% larger , mostly because the photodissociation rate of this molecule is dominated by the very strong absorption into the @xmath113 state around 8 ev , which was included in previous estimates .",
    "it is seen that the rates for the various carbon - bearing molecules span a range of a factor of 8 , with the rates for the bare carbon chains ( c@xmath0 , c@xmath1 ) being largest and those for the odd - numbered c@xmath11h species lowest . of the different c@xmath0h@xmath2 isomers",
    ", @xmath3c@xmath0h@xmath2 has the largest photodissociation rate and @xmath4c@xmath0h@xmath2 the smallest by a factor of 3 .",
    "however , @xmath4c@xmath0h@xmath2 differs from the other isomers in that it has several states with large oscillator strengths above the ionization potential of 9.15 ev . if those states were included , the @xmath4c@xmath0h@xmath2 photodissociation rate would be increased by a factor of 2 . for @xmath3c@xmath0h@xmath2 ,",
    "the rate would drop from @xmath114 to @xmath115 s@xmath50 if the @xmath85 state is not included .    in spite of the range of values , all rates are above @xmath116 s@xmath50 , coresponding to a lifetime of less than 30 yr at the edge of an interstellar cloud . in regions such as the orion bar and the horsehead nebula ,",
    "the radiation field is enhanced by factors of @xmath117 compared with the standard field adopted here , decreasing the lifetimes to less than 1 month .",
    "thus , there must be rapid production routes of these molecules in order to explain their high abundances in uv - exposed regions .",
    "this conclusion is not changed if only 10% , say , of the absorptions would lead to dissociation rather than the 100% assumed here .",
    "as argued in  2 and 3 , it is plausible that a substantial fraction of the absorptions lead to dissociation for these larger molecules so that the upper limits should be close to the actual values .",
    "we have presented vertical excitation energies , transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths for states up to the 9th root of each symmetry for several carbonaceous molecules of astrophysical interest . for lower - lying states ,",
    "good agreement is generally found with previous studies .",
    "several new , higher - lying states with large oscillator strengths , often of rydberg character , are revealed in this work .",
    "the calculated photodissociation rates of the small carbon - bearing molecules studied here are substantial , leading to lifetimes at the edges of interstellar clouds of less than 30 yr .",
    "these high rates assume that all absorptions above the dissociation limit indeed lead to dissociation , so that the rates should be viewed as upper limits .",
    "further experimental work is needed to quantify the dissociation efficiencies for the strongest states found in this work .",
