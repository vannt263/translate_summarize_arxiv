    "the standard theoretical paradigm for the central engine in quasars and their radio - quiet kin ( qsos ) is a viscous accretion disc surrounding a massive black hole .",
    "direct evidence for accretion discs , such as double - peaked emission lines @xcite , is important to seek but hard to come by .",
    "perhaps the best reasons for belief in this paradigm are basic considerations of energy and angular momentum .",
    "such discs are the most plausible astrophysical mechanism for converting rest mass to radiation with high efficiency , and if the relics of qsos reside in galactic nuclei , then efficiencies @xmath4 are required @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum specific angular momentum of a kerr black hole , @xmath5 , is far less than that of most mass in galaxies .",
    "( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mass of the black hole . )",
    "accreting gas must be separated from its angular momentum , and a viscous disc is the most natural mechanism .",
    "most of the binding energy of the disc is in its inner parts , so that the outer radius of a standard accretion disc is almost irrelevant to its bolometric luminosity .",
    "in contrast , most of the angular momentum is in the outer regions , so that the outer radius of the disc is sensitive to the initial angular momentum of the gas that feeds it . in a previous paper ( *",
    "* henceforth paper i ) , it was argued that luminosity and angular momentum are coupled by the requirement that qso discs be stable against their own self - gravity .",
    "it is well known that gravitational stability is problematic in the outer parts of qso discs @xcite .",
    "the threat to the standard paradigm is that a strongly selfgravitating disc is likely to fragment completely into stars , leaving insufficient gas to fuel the qso .",
    "as discussed in paper i , viable solutions to this difficulty fall into several categories :    1 .   enhanced angular momentum transport , not necessarily by viscous processes but at rates corresponding to a viscosity parameter @xmath8 ; 2 .   auxiliary heating in excess of what is provided by dissipating orbital energy , so as to reduce the gas density and selfgravity of the disc ; 3 .   replacement of the outer disc with a very dense star cluster , whose collisional debris supply a disc of small radius and negligible selfgravity ; 4 .",
    "relatively low initial angular momentum for the gas , which therefore circularizes at small enough radius so as to avoid selfgravity .",
    "a number of options in the first category were briefly considered in paper i , including accretion driven by bars or global spiral waves ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or by magnetized winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "but it was argued that none of these options is likely to achieve a supersonic accretion speed , and hence that discs can not be stabilized much beyond one parsec by any of these mechanisms alone .",
    "the third category was tentatively rejected on the grounds that remnants of such star clusters are not observed in present day galactic nuclei .",
    "recently , @xcite have proposed discs whose thickness is supported primarily by magnetic pressure . if this is possible , it would imply lower disc densities on average , but the field might well squeeze the gas into dense clumps and thereby actually exacerbate selfgravity . at any rate , @xcite do not apply their model to the cool outer regions beyond @xmath9 .    the present paper will focus on some implications of the second category of solutions , which appear to be a natural compromise between a purely gaseous disc and a star cluster .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that part of the gas fragments into stars , and that the energy released by nuclear fusion and other stellar processes ( supernovae , stellar - mass black holes ) may sufficiently heat the rest of the gas so as to prevent complete fragmentation @xcite .",
    "there is a great deal of evidence that such a feedback cycle operates in the discs of spiral galaxies on kiloparsec scales",
    ".    observed seds of typical quasars differ markedly from classical theoretical predictions in which the disc is assumed to be geometrically thin , optically thick , steady , and heated solely by viscous dissipation @xcite . to a first approximation ,",
    "the typical sed is flat in a @xmath10 plot over many decades in wavelength @xcite .",
    "relative to the classical predictions , there is excess emission at both x - ray and infrared wavelengths .",
    "the former is conventionally ascribed to comptonization in a hot corona at small radii @xcite , and the latter to passive reprocessing in warped or flared outer parts of the disc @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the infrared excess may be due to the energy inputs required to stabilize the outer disc against its own selfgravity .",
    "we obtain a lower bound on the auxiliary heating needed to stabilize the disc for given values of the macroscopic parameters : namely , the black hole mass ( @xmath7 ) , accretion rate ( @xmath11 ) , and disc outer radius ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "as shown in paper i , and confirmed here with more realistic opacities , the inputs required for gravitational stability increase with the outer radius of the disc , @xmath13 .",
    "paper i argued for an upper limit to @xmath13 based on the energy available from plausible sources , such as fusion or accretion onto stellar - mass black holes . in this paper , we find limits to @xmath13 from the sed .",
    "it is not obvious that the auxiliary inputs should be completely thermalized , but if we assume this , then the sed can be predicted .",
    "the observed infrared emission of typical qsos may be due largely to reprocessing of light emitted from the inner parts of the disc , as conventionally supposed .",
    "but by attributing all of the infrared light to the auxiliary energy inputs , and insisting that these inputs be sufficient for gravitational stability , we obtain bounds for @xmath13 .",
    "these bounds depend upon other parameters , especially the mass of the black hole , the accretion rate , and the viscosity parameter @xmath14 .",
    "we explore these dependencies .",
    "the meaning of @xmath12 constrained by this method is the radius within which @xmath11 is sensibly constant ; obviously the disc can be extended indefinitely if the accretion rate and mass at large radii are sufficiently small .",
    "hence our limits on @xmath12 are best translated into upper limits on the initial angular momentum of the gas that is accreted .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows .",
    " 2 lays out the physical assumptions and governing equations for our disc models .",
    "these are the same as for the classical steady thin disc , with the one important exception that wherever the classical model would be gravitationally unstable , we invoke just enough auxiliary heating to stabilize it .",
    "a discussion of opacities becomes critically important , because the requirement of marginal stability fixes the density and temperature at the midplane ( for given @xmath11 and @xmath14 ) ; the flux escaping from the disc , and hence the amount of auxiliary heating needed , then depend upon the optical depth . the computed radial structure of the disc is presented in  3 for parameters representative of bright quasars . since our assumptions are no different from the classical ones at small radii , we emphasize the properties of our discs in the marginally selfgravitating region @xmath15 , and we compare our seds with those presented by @xcite to obtain upper limits on the outer radius of the disc and the initial angular momentum of the gas . in the final section , we summarize our conclusions , issue the necessary caveats , and discuss directions for future research .",
    "we start by considering the standard steady @xmath14 disc . in this model ,",
    "gas is accreted onto a central black hole of mass @xmath16 in a steady , keplerian , geometrically thin accretion disc at a constant rate @xmath17 .",
    "accretion is driven by viscous mechanisms , but the exact mechanism ( probably magnetorotationally - driven turbulence ) is unimportant here .",
    "newtonian equations will be used .",
    "these are not accurate near the inner edge of the disc , but the effects of selfgravity are at large radii where relativistic corrections are unimportant .",
    "we assume that each annulus of the disc radiates as a blackbody with temperature @xmath18 .",
    "when accretion is the only source of thermal energy , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and we have defined for notational simplicity @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the inner radius of the accretion disc . a zero - torque boundary condition has been assumed . in a relativistic thin - disc analysis , @xmath22 would be the radius of the marginally stable orbit . in our newtonian framework , we set @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the schwarzschild radius and @xmath25 is the assumed radiative efficiency of accretion .",
    "an @xmath14 prescription for the viscosity is adopted , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the isothermal sound speed at the disc midplane , @xmath28 the half thickness , and @xmath29 is the ratio of gas pressure to total pressure at the midplane .",
    "the viscosity is related to the accretion rate by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the surface density at a given radius .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is a switch that can be either @xmath33 , so that viscosity is proportional to gas pressure , or @xmath34 , so that viscosity is proportional to total pressure .",
    "magnetic pressure is assumed to contribute negligibly to the thickness of the disc , even if magnetic stresses dominate angular momentum transport .",
    "because it will turn out that the optically thick assumption fails at large radii , we now turn to a study of the relationship between the midplane temperature @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we assume radiative energy transport in the vertical ( @xmath37 ) direction and write @xmath38 for the optical depth at the midplane . in the optically thick limit @xmath39 ,",
    "the diffusive approximation is applicable so that @xmath40 , with a numerical factor of order unity that depends upon the vertical variation of opacity @xmath41 and the vertical distribution of viscous dissipation .",
    "the latter is not yet predictable from theory , despite major advances in understanding magnetohydrodynamic disc turbulence . if one assumes constant dissipation per unit optical depth , then @xmath42 where the `` @xmath43 '' follows from the eddington approximation to the boundary condition at the photosphere . in the opposite limit of low optical depth , the radiative flux from one side of the disc scales as @xmath44 . again",
    "a numerical factor occurs .",
    "one should distinguish between absorption and scattering opacity , but at the large accretion rates of interest to us , optically thin conditions tend to occur where the opacity is primarily absorptive . for a vertically isothermal disc , @xmath45 when @xmath46 .",
    "simple interpolation between the optically thin and optically thick limits yields eq .",
    "( [ e : t ] ) below , which satisfies the physical requirement that @xmath47 for any @xmath48 ( in fact , the minimum of @xmath49 is @xmath50 and occurs when @xmath51 ) .",

    "the numerical factor is correct for an isothermal slab of midplane optical depth @xmath54 .",
    "we also must know the opacity in the disc ( equation  [ e : kappa ] ) .",
    "we use the opacity tables of @xcite for high temperatures and those of @xcite for low temperatures , with @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",

    "the two opacity tables overlap in the region @xmath57 , and figure  [ f : opacity ] demonstrates their agreement .",
    "additionally , the loci of two disc models are projected onto the plot .",
    "extrapolation of the opacity tables in the low density regime is necessary .",
    "this is done by simply assigning @xmath41 its value at the low - density edge of the opacity table ( using the same value of @xmath35 ) .",
    "this extrapolation is presumably correct for high temperatures ( @xmath58 ) where the opacity is dominated by electron scattering . at lower temperatures ,",

    "the dashed ( @xmath62 ) and dotted ( @xmath63 ) lines show trajectories of @xmath64 for typical examples of our disc models ( figure   for @xmath62 ) , up to @xmath65 . ]    in summary , our governing equations for the disc are as follows ( we take @xmath66 as the mean molecular mass ) : @xmath67    for an accretion disc with given parameters @xmath7 , @xmath17 , @xmath14 , and @xmath32 , we can solve these eleven equations for the eleven unknowns : @xmath36 , @xmath35 , @xmath48 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath41 at every radius @xmath75 , which is related simply to @xmath76 .",
    "the outer parts of the accretion disc will be prone to selfgravity if toomre s stability parameter , @xmath77 is @xmath78 . in our model , we assume there is some feedback mechanism , perhaps star formation , that supplies just enough additional heat to the disc as to prevent @xmath2 falling below a minimum value @xmath79 . the energy source for these auxiliary inputs must be something other than the orbital energy of the gas , for example , nuclear fusion in stars .",
    "the quantity of these inputs is fixed by the properties of the disc : in particular the opacities , since the more easily radiation escapes , the more the disc must be heated to maintain stability .",
    "the nature of the auxiliary sources is not important to the spectral energy distribution as long as their inputs are completely thermalized .    when @xmath80 , eq .",
    "( [ e : teff ] ) , which assumes the disc to be heated by release of orbital energy only , is no longer appropriate ; we replace it with @xmath81 and @xmath36 must be obtained from equation  [ e : t ] .",

    "such differences are most likely in those parts of the disc whose emission is dominated by passive reprocessing @xcite or are optically thin ( to absorption ) .",

    "+    figure  [ f : sed_le_b0 ] shows that while the blue bump increases with mass accretion rate , the energy output of the infrared bump is hardly affected , for the @xmath62 case .",
    "this invariance is caused by two competing factors as @xmath85 is increased : @xmath36 is higher in the selfgravitating region , but because @xmath35 is also higher , the onset of the optically thin regime , and thus a sharp increase in @xmath36 as shown in figure  [ f : radial_parms ] , is delayed .",
    "similar considerations explain the behavior of the infrared bump in figure  [ f : sed_le_b1 ] , for @xmath63 . for low accretion rates ,",
    "the midplane temperature drops low enough that the disc becomes optically thin before the end of the disc ( at @xmath125 ) , which drives up @xmath36 .    in figure  [",
    "f : sed_alpha ] , the same argument explains the behavior of the infrared bump in both the @xmath62 and @xmath63 cases .",
    "the onset of the optically thin selfgravitating region is at smaller radii with increasing @xmath14 for both cases , but @xmath36 is higher in the optically thick selfgravitating region for @xmath63 .",
    "it is clear that additional heating in the outer parts of our accretion discs results in a second bump in the sed .",
    "assuming that this outer - disc contribution to the sed can be no more prominent than infrared emission in the observed med , we can already place tight constraints on the outer radius of these disc models : @xmath126 .    , @xmath121 ) , with @xmath95 and @xmath96 fixed .",

    "we have estimated spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of bright qsos using standard assumptions , with one addition : where the disc would otherwise be gravitationally unstable , we have postulated additional sources of heat , other than release of orbital energy by accretion , just sufficient to maintain gravitational stability .",
    "these sources become necessary beyond @xmath130 for typical parameters . assuming their energy inputs to be locally and completely thermalized , we have calculated their contribution to the sed and luminosity of the disc , which occurs primarily in the red and near infrared .",
    "the larger the disc , the more auxiliary heating is required . for typical black - hole masses and accretion rates inferred from the blue bump ,",
    "the auxiliary inputs actually exceed the power derived from accretion if the disc extends beyond @xmath131 , or about one parsec . this would be incompatible with the typical sed of bright qsos , which is approximately flat in @xmath10 .",
    "paper i placed similar limits on @xmath13 from energetic arguments .",
    "it was assumed that the stars or small black holes that heat the disc also form within the disc , and that the mass in these objects is at most comparable to that of the disc .",
    "the present limits do not rely on these assumptions .",
    "that is to say , if the disc were heated by a much larger mass in stars , the limits of paper i could be relaxed , but those based on the sed would still apply .",
    "it has been assumed that the accretion rate is constant with radius , so that @xmath11 at large radii can be derived from the luminosity in the blue bump ( which has no contribution from the auxiliary sources ) .",
    "if @xmath11 at @xmath132 is several orders of magnitude less than it is at @xmath133 , then the disc could be much more extensive than we have supposed .",
    "the stefan - boltzmann law implies that the observed luminosity at @xmath134 must in any case come from @xmath135 , but this does not require that the surface density at that distance is as high as in a constant-@xmath11 disc .",
    "therefore , it is useful to rephrase the limits in terms of the initial angular momentum of the gas supplied to the disc . at least on a time average ,",
    "@xmath11 should be constant inside the radius corresponding to the initial angular momentum .",
    "the relationship is @xmath136 this is quite small compared with the product of virial velocity ( @xmath137 ) and scale size ( @xmath138 ) of qso hosts , and it may be important to ask where gas with such low angular momentum comes from . furthermore , the mass of a gravitationally stable disc that obeys our constraints on the sed is generally much less than that of the black hole , so that the disc must be replenished many times over to grow the black hole by accretion .",
    "our treatment of the disc is highly simplified and certainly crude compared with many past efforts .",
    "we have ignored relativistic effects , adopted a one - zone model for the vertical structure , used rosseland mean opacities without distinguishing between scattering and absorption , taken a constant molecular weight , and represented angular - momentum transport by the usual viscous @xmath14 prescription .",
    "we feel that these simplifications are justified by the strong dependence of the auxiliary inputs and the sed on the outer radius of the disc .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the physics that one actually understands seems unlikely to change our conclusions concerning @xmath13 .",
    "radical enhancements in transport ( equivalent to @xmath139 ) , or magnetic pressures @xmath140 ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could make some difference , but these are not yet understood .    despite what has just been said , a more elaborate treatment of vertical structure and radiative transfer might point to a redistribution of the auxiliary energy inputs in wavelength , if not their total contribution to the disc luminosity .",
    "unfortunately , one has no reliable predictions for the vertical distribution of purely viscous heating , much less of the auxiliary sources postulated here , which will limit the credibility of detailed vertical models .    even if the actively accreting parts of qso discs are smaller than @xmath141 , it is still possible that selfgravity is important in them , and therefore that they form stars .",
