    "the two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) @xcite are one of the most widely investigated scenarios that go beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "any 2hdm consists of five physical scalars : two cp - even neutral @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one cp - odd neutral @xmath3 , and two charged bosons @xmath4 .",
    "the cp quantum numbers are , of course , assigned with the assumption that the scalar potential is cp conserving and hence the mass eigenstates are also cp eigenstates . however",
    ", a generic 2hdm suffers from large flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) ; to prevent this , one invokes the glashow - weinberg - paschos theorem @xcite .",
    "the theorem states that there will be no tree - level fcnc if all right - handed fermions of a given electric charge couple to only one of the doublets .",
    "this can be achieved in 2hdms by introducing discrete symmetries for fermions or scalars .",
    "let us denote the two doublets by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and invoke a @xmath7 symmetry @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "there are four types of 2hdm , depending on the transformation of the fermions under this @xmath7 , for which there will be no tree - level fcnc .",
    "they are : ( i ) type i , for which all fermions couple with @xmath6 and none with @xmath5 ; ( ii ) type ii , for which up - type quarks couple to @xmath6 and down - type quarks and charged leptons couple to @xmath5 ( this is the type that is embedded in the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) and hence has received the most attention ) ; ( iii ) type y ( sometimes called type iii or flipped ) , for which up - type quarks and charged leptons couple to @xmath6 and down - type quarks couple to @xmath5 , and ( iv ) type x ( sometimes called type iv or lepton - specific ) , for which all charged leptons couple to @xmath5 and all quarks couple to @xmath6 . apart from these four",
    ", there are other 2hdms with tree - level fcnc which can be kept under control @xcite and which lead to interesting phenomenology @xcite which we will not pursue in this paper .",
    "the facts that the sm can be an effective theory valid all the way up to the planck scale ( @xmath10 gev ) and there is no symmetry protecting the scalar masses lead to the naturalness problem : why the higgs boson mass is of the order of the electroweak scale and not driven by the radiative corrections to the planck scale .",
    "as we do not yet know , from experiments , of any symmetry that can protect the scalar mass , we will take a bottom - up approach , first suggested by veltman @xcite , that due to some yet - to - be - discovered symmetry , the radiative corrections to the scalar mass either vanish or are kept at a manageable level .",
    "this is popularly known as the veltman condition ( vc ) .",
    "the veltman condition is not an anthropic principle .",
    "rather , it gives a concrete guideline of how the sm extensions should look like if we are to address the naturalness problem .",
    "( exact supersymmetry is one such guideline : a superparticle loop with an opposite sign to the corresponding particle loop , hence cancelling the divergence . ) in the sm with a scalar potential v ( ) = -^2^+ ( ^)^2 , [ sm - pot ] and the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) given by @xmath11 , the one - loop quadratically divergent correction to the higgs self - energy is @xcite m_h^2 = ( 6 + 34 g_1 ^ 2 + 94 g_2 ^ 2 - 6 g_t^2 ) , [ smvc ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the @xmath14 and @xmath15 gauge couplings , and @xmath16 is the top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "contributions from other fermions are negligible .",
    "we use the cut - off regularization , @xmath17 being the cutoff scale .",
    "this is not a lorentz invariant regularization but has the nice feature of separating the quadratic and the logarithmic divergences .",
    "dimensional regularization does not discriminate between these two , and one gets a slightly different correction @xcite , which includes all the divergences lumped into the ubiquitous @xmath18 : m_h^2 ( 6 + 14 g_1 ^ 2 + 34 g_2 ^ 2 - 6 g_t^2 ) . as our goal is to cancel the strongest divergence",
    ", we will use the cut - off regularization .",
    "there are further quadratic divergences coming from two - loop diagrams , but they are suppressed from one - loop contributions by a factor of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the regularization scale , and is in general small and under control .",
    "this correction shifts the unphysical bare mass parameter to the physical pole mass of 125 gev : m_h^2 = m_h^bare^2 + m_h^2 .",
    "thus , @xmath21 is a measure of fine - tuning of the theory .",
    "the strict vc implies @xmath22 .",
    "we may say that the naturalness problem has been avoided if @xmath23 , . ] which translates into m_h^2 + 2m_w^2 + m_z^2 - 4m_t^2 m_h^2 .",
    "[ smvc2 ] this inequality is clearly not satisfied in the sm for @xmath24 , or @xmath25 gev , and onset of np at such a low scale is almost ruled out by the lhc .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ smvc ] ) that some positive contribution to @xmath26 is needed to offset the large negative contribution of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the minimal extension of the sm that can satisfy the vc must be bosonic in nature . the easiest option is to introduce new scalars , with the rider that it is imperative to keep these new scalars light too ; so simultaneous solution to a set of vcs is required .",
    "one might also introduce new gauge bosons that couple to the sm higgs , but more scalars are anyway needed to give mass to these gauge bosons in a gauge - invariant way .    with new scalars ,",
    "there are two ways to solve the vcs",
    ". some of the scalar couplings may be negative .",
    "this gives a negative contribution to the vc , akin to the fermion loops .",
    "however , one must take into account the stability of the potential at all energy scales .",
    "the second one is to allow explicit couplings to the fermions for all the scalars . apart from the 2hdm type - i , all other 2hdms have fermionic couplings for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the role of the vc in exploring possible directions for new physics has been well explored in the literature .",
    "however , the minimal extension , with one or more singlet scalars , received the most attention @xcite .",
    "such singlets are interesting as possible cold dark matter candidates if they do not mix with the doublet higgs . in that case , one is forced to introduce some new fermion multiplets , vectorial in nature , to address the fine - tuning of the singlets . a model with a complex scalar triplet",
    "has also been investigated @xcite , which is relevant in the context of type-2 see - saw mechanism and leptogenesis ( even though the minimal version of the triplet model does not work properly for the latter ) .",
    "the attractive point about the triplet is that no extra fermions are needed ; the neutrinos couple with the triplet scalars and can potentially solve the fine - tuning problem , at the same time ensuring a small neutrino mass .",
    "the 2hdms share the same property of requiring no extra fermions , and are therefore interesting as a minimal extension to the sm to successfully address the fine - tuning problem",
    ". consequences of applying the vc to 2hdms were discussed in ref.@xcite and then later discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "of course , the higgs boson was not discovered then and the parameter space was much larger , but we would still like to refer the reader to @xcite for some points not covered in detail here , like the possibility of cp violation in the scalar sector , or enhancing the 2hdm with one more singlet to generate a cold dark matter candidate .    except for type i 2hdm , fermionic couplings exist for all the scalars . even without fermions ,",
    "the vc could have been satisfied with some negative scalar quartic couplings , but the stability condition of the scalar potential rules that out , as we will see later .",
    "it will also be shown that the imposition of the vc puts a significant constraint on the parameter space .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 , the ratio of the vevs of two scalars , is no longer a free parameter .",
    "later we will try to quantify this statement .",
    "we will also show that only type - ii and flipped 2hdms can remain valid up to the planck scale if the couplings are to satisfy the vcs and also respect the stability criteria of the potential .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , we display the scalar potential and yukawa interactions of different 2hdms and the stability conditions ; we also formulate the veltman conditions .",
    "the analysis is in section iii , and section iv summarizes and concludes the paper .",
    "the one - loop renormalization group equations ( rge ) for all the couplings are listed in appendix a.",
    "we will follow the notations and conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite and confine ourselves only to the four types of 2hdm with no tree - level fcnc .",
    "this can be achieved with the following discrete symmetries ( we show only those fields that flip sign under @xmath7 ) :    * type i : @xmath28 ; * type ii : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ; * lepton specific : @xmath28 , @xmath30 ; * flipped : @xmath28 , @xmath29 ,    where @xmath31 is the generation index . both the scalar doublets @xmath5 and @xmath6 have hypercharge @xmath32 , and the lower components , which are electrically neutral , get nonzero vev : _ 1=    0 v_1    , _ 2=    0 v_2    , with @xmath33 ( without loss of generality , @xmath34 can be taken to lie in the first quadrant , so that both @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 .",

    "] we consider this limit to be a pretty conservative estimate .",
    "the mass term @xmath37 has nothing to do with the quadratic divergences , but it controls the physical scalar masses . in the @xmath77 basis , the cp - even mass matrix is m_cp - even =    m_12 ^ 2 + _ 1 v^2 ^ 2 & -m_12 ^ 2 + 12(_3+_4+_5 ) v^22 -m_12 ^ 2 + 12(_3+_4+_5 ) v^22 & m_12 ^ 2 + _ 2 v^2 ^ 2    which follows from the minimization conditions .",

    "the charged higgs mass is given by m^2_h^+ = 2m_12 ^ 2/2 - 12 v^2(_4 + _ 5 ) and the cp - odd state has a mass m^2_a = 2 m_12 ^ 2/2-v^2 _ 5 .",
    "this shows that in the large @xmath0 limit ( @xmath85 ) , in which we will be interested , @xmath37 should be positive unless @xmath68 ( and maybe @xmath67 ) is large and negative .",
    "it can be easily checked that such large negative values of @xmath68 at the electroweak scale lead to a further downward running of @xmath68 at higher energy scales and hence make the potential unstable very quickly .",
    "thus , we will always take @xmath37 to be positive in our analysis .",
    "that @xmath37 can not be large and negative can also be checked from the minimization conditions @xmath86 , @xmath87 . with eq.([minimiz ] ) , this leads to a lower bound m_12 ^ 2 + _ 1 v_1 ^ 2 > 0 ,   m_12 ^ 2 + _ 2 v_2 ^ 2 > 0 .",
    "we have also imposed the charged higgs mass limit of @xmath88 gev for type - ii and flipped models , mostly coming from @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "there are no such limits on the lepton - specific model ( and also on type - i ) , but the non - observation at the lhc has been taken into account .",

    "we consider only those values of the aforesaid parameters that pass the stability criteria of the potential and also give at least one charge- and cp - conserving minimum .",
    "after this , we impose both the vcs , but not in the strictest sense ; we keep a narrow window for possible two - loop and higher - order corrections .      as @xmath5 does not couple to fermions , the vc for @xmath38 , eq .",
    "( [ type_1 ] ) , has to be satisfied from negative quartic couplings @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "however , it is easy to check that this makes the vacuum unstable .",
    "this is a generic feature over the entire parameter space and therefore we will not further discuss the type - i 2hdm . suffice it to say that the fine - tuning problem remains in type - i 2hdm , and probably in all 2hdms where at least one of the doublet does not couple to the fermions .      even before we start the analysis , it is intuitively obvious that the vcs can only be satisfied in the large @xmath0 region if the @xmath81 couplings are small , as only in this region @xmath90 is comparable in magnitude with @xmath91 or @xmath92 . again , in the large @xmath0 region , @xmath90 , which is proportional to @xmath93 , is more or less constant . as the other terms in @xmath94",

    "[ lepsp - range ] we find @xmath145 with @xmath127 , and @xmath146 .",
    "such large values of @xmath0 is known to be problematic for possible non - perturbative behavious of the yukawa couplings . as",
    "the yukawa couplings have a negative pull on the quartics , large values for them tend to make the quartic couplings negative very quickly , making the potential unstable .",
    "in fact , for the entire allowed parameter space , such instability occurs below 1 tev .",
    "thus , one is forced to predict some cutoff at 1 tev or below , above which a new dynamics takes over .",
    "we have discussed the fine - tuning problem in the context of 2hdms . in particular , we try to find the parameter space in several 2hdms where the quadratic divergences of the scalar masses are under control .",
    "we have kept ourselves confined only among those models that do not have any tree - level fcnc , and explore the possible parameter space where the veltman conditions are satisfied for all the scalars .",
    "this is helped by the fermionic couplings of the scalars ; type - i 2hdm does not possess this feature , @xmath5 does not have any fermionic coupling , so a successful cancellation of the @xmath147 terms is never possible , even if we take some quartic scalar couplings to be negative .",
    "we emphasize that our results are valid only for standalone 2hdms , not when they are embedded in a larger theory .",
    "in contrast with the sm ( or the type - i 2hdm ) , it is possible to find a parameter space for all the other three 2hdms where the vcs are satisfied .",
    "this may not seem very surprising , as we have more parameters to play with , but note that we also have a large number of constraints : the stability of the potential , the existence of a cp - even minimum , the lightest cp - even neutral scalar close to 125 gev , the constraint on the charged higgs mass , the necessity of making the 125 gev scalar behave like the sm higgs boson , etc .",
    "that such constraints are important can be seen from the lepton - specific 2hdm , where the requirement of large @xmath0 forces large yukawa couplings and destroys the stability of the potential at most above 1 tev .",
    "however , it is too early to say that such models are not compatible with both lhc data and solution of the naturalness problem ; 1 tev is hardly a scale where one would talk about naturalness , and two - loop corrections might push the limit a bit upwards .",
    "we find solutions only for the large @xmath0 case : about 31.5 for type - ii , 42.5 for flipped , and about 140 for lepton - specific models . in fact , the allowed values of @xmath0 are severely restricted .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath79 is almost linear for type ii and flipped 2hdm ; for the lepton specific 2hdm the dependence is more complicated .",
    "anyway , we believe that this is an interesting result in the study of 2hdm .    not all the solutions for type - ii and flipped 2hdms are valid till the planck scale .",
    "in particular , whenever we start with a large quartic coupling , there is always a chance that the landau pole will be hit before @xmath148 .",
    "fortunately , for most part of the parameter space , even if the blow - up occurs , the scale is rather large and beyond the reach of the lhc .",
    "such a behaviour may be taken as indicative of some other new physics taking over at that scale .",
    "for lepton - specific models , the instability demands some new physics possibly within the lhc reach",
    ".    everything would have been perfect if the vcs were absolutely stable with the scale variation .",
    "unfortunately , this is not so . but",
    "this may be due to the simplistic approach of keeping only the one - loop terms ; at higher - orders , we might expect a scale independence .",
