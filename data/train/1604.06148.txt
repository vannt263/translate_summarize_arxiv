    "as finite sized rigid particles are brought together by increasing their density or by compression , they undergo sharp transitions into globally rigid structures , a phenomenon known as jamming @xcite .",
    "such systems do not in general form periodic spatial patterns associated with crystalline solids , instead they display rigidity in an amorphous fashion .",
    "the physical properties of such amorphous solids are intimately linked with the underlying disorder in their packing . the packing of particles into mechanically rigid structures has been of interest in diverse fields including physics , biology and geology and has wide - ranging industrial applications .",
    "several characteristics of rigid particle packings have been studied experimentally and also via numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "many theoretical studies have focussed on frictionless particles with hard core interactions , and much of our rigorous understanding stems from the study of such systems @xcite .",
    "particles with isotropic shapes such as spheres and disks are particularly appealing in terms of their mathematical tractability , and have a long history of study in their own right @xcite .",
    "they have frequently been used as idealized models to study more general problems of granular materials , glassy systems and even information theory @xcite .",
    "although hard cores serve as a good first approximation to real particles , the incorporation of distance dependent interactions represents a non - trivial generalization which continues to be a subject of active research . a natural way to introduce such interactions",
    "is by considering particles with soft cores , with an energy dependent on the amount of overlap between particles .",
    "soft particle packings , which yield hard particle systems in the limit of zero overlap , have also been the subject of considerable interest @xcite .",
    "recently such packings of soft frictionless particles have also been realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "the jamming of soft frictionless disks in two dimensions has been investigated in great detail over the last decade @xcite .",
    "as soft disks are gradually compressed , they undergo a transition to a _ marginally jammed state _ at a well - defined protocol - dependent density .",
    "this marginal state , although at zero pressure and zero energy , nevertheless displays peculiar spatial characteristics , such as local randomness and long range hyperuniformity @xcite .",
    "the reproducibility of several properties of marginal states , such as zero energy packing fractions and contact numbers , despite their seemingly random internal structures have led to a renewed interest in their structural properties .",
    "several entropic arguments have been proposed to explain these characteristics of soft disks close to the jamming transition including that the marginal state is _ maximally random _",
    "@xcite , or that the majority of states belong to basins that jam at the same density @xcite .",
    "bulk properties of jammed soft disks have been extensively investigated and several _ average _ properties of marginally jammed disks have been well corroborated .",
    "the average number of contacts per particle in the marginally jammed state of sphere packings is well known : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the dimensionality of the embedding space .",

    "isostaticity_. for disks that we consider in this paper @xmath9 .",
    "the distributions of the contact lengths , contact angles and two point correlations have also been studied in detail @xcite . however despite considerable effort , several questions about jamming transitions of even simple frictionless soft disks remain unanswered @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the local microstructures in packings close to the transition remain relatively less understood .",
    "similarly , the spatial randomness of the network and the nature of the underlying disorder is an aspect that has not received much attention .",
    "although there is a well defined transition in the bulk properties of the system with continuously measurable quantities such as packing fraction , there are discontinuous jumps in several structural variables that are ill - defined on one side of the transition .",
    "these include network properties such as connectivities of particles , shear and pressure .",
    "it is not a - priori obvious that the two sides of the transition can be described with a single theory , and indeed by the same microscopic variables . in this context",
    "it becomes important to identify the relevant microscopic variables with which to describe the behaviour of the system near the transition .",
    "in this paper we study the spatial structures that arise near the well - studied jamming transition of frictionless soft disks .",
    "we focus specifically on jammed configurations near the unjamming transition point , i.e. we approach the transition from mechanically stable packings with decreasing energies",
    ". the main results of this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "we introduce a representation that assigns convex polygonal areas to the disks and _ also _ to the voids ( see fig .",
    "[ explanatory_figures ] ) .",
    "we also assign a measure to this polygonal construction using a delaunay triangulation of the underlying network .",
    "this allows us to study the structural properties of both voids and disks and accurately measure their statistics .",
    "although the underlying degrees of freedom have complicated joint probability distributions arising from constraint satisfaction , we find that they display self averaging behaviour , such that system averages are equivalent to ensemble averages .",
    "this allows us to measure reproducible distribution functions of these individual quantities .",
    "we find that the total area occupied by the grain polygons serves as a reliable real space parameter that displays non - trivial scaling as the transition is approached .",
    "we perform large scale simulations to measure scaling exponents associated with this area as the transition is approached .",
    "we then distribute this total area into microscopic variables by assigning well - defined areas to each contact and find this works well as a local field .",
    "finally we use this construction to study the nature of the disorder that arises in such packings .",
    "our study relies on the special convexity properties that appear in frictionless force balanced systems ( see section [ convexity_section ] ) .",
    "this highlights the difference between the contact networks that emerge in frictional and frictionless systems .",

    ", we refer to the particles interchangeably as disks or  grains \" .",
    "we use capitalized letters to represent global quantities and lower case letters to represent local properties .",

    "the total number of grains is referred to by @xmath19 . when quoting @xmath19 from simulation data , we follow the convention that all grains used in the simulation are counted , regardless of whether they are a part of the contact network in the final jammed state . in computing all other system quantities",

    "we generate a  polygonal graph \" by partitioning the two dimensional space into polygonal tilings of grains and voids , and a  triangulation graph \" by a delaunay triangulation of locally convex sections of the contact network .",
    "recently voronoi tesselations have proved fruitful in understanding the local spatial structures of packings @xcite .",
    "our procedure differs from the voronoi tesselation in that it is able to assign well defined sections of space to grains as well as to voids .",
    "the packing of disks in the two dimensional plane can naturally be considered as a decomposition of space into regions that lie within the circular areas associated with the disks and regions that lie outside .",
    "we refer to these exterior regions as  voids \" . in jammed packings ,",
    "these voids are completely enclosed by the areas of grains surrounding them , and in general have a complicated , non - convex shape ( see fig . [ explanatory_figures ] ) .",
    "the total number of such voids is referred to by @xmath42 . in order to characterize these voids we can use the positions of the surrounding grains to build circuits around them .",
    "this is done by constructing a circuit of distance vectors with vertices at the centres of the grains surrounding each void @xmath43 as @xmath44 ( see fig . [ explanatory_figures ] ) .",
    "these circuits are also referred to as _ minimum cycles _ of the contact network since they represent the shortest possible loops in this network .",
    "each minimum cycle is uniquely associated with a void , and completely encloses the non - circular shaped space formed between the disks .",
    "using the positions and radii of the grains in a given configuration we can next construct the contacts between the grains . although the contacts occur as finite regions of overlap between grains , we assign them to unique points in space .",

    "@xmath47 where @xmath48 is the total number of contacts in the system . in this convention",
    "every contact is counted twice , once for each grain . the convention in eq .",
    "( [ contact_positions_equation ] ) also ensures that configurations that are related by a simple expansion or contraction of all disks have the same contact network .",
    "using the positions of contacts belonging to every grain , we can assign  contact vectors \" to each grain as @xmath49 where @xmath14 refers to the grain index and @xmath46 refers to the contact number associated with the grain , @xmath36 .",
    "the number of contacts @xmath50 is also referred to as the  connectivity \" of the grain .",
    "every contact vector has two degrees of freedom which can be parametrized by its length @xmath51 and its angle in relation to the @xmath52-axis @xmath53 .",
    "the system can then be parametrized in terms of the contact vectors , although this is an overcounting of the degrees of freedom .",
    "the contact vectors must satisfy constraints in order for them to be a valid packing .",
    "we discuss these constraints in detail in section [ coordination_section ] .",
    "the normality of forces in the system of frictionless disks leads to special convexity properties of the contact network .",
    "the force balance condition on each grain disallows any configuration in which contacts lie on _ only _ one semi - circle of a disk , since this would generate a net force along the direction normal to this semi - circle .",
    "we refer to this statement as the  semi - circle condition \" .",
    "this then ensures that the relative angles between the contact vectors obeys @xmath54 where @xmath55 is taken cyclically within each grain . using this property",
    ", we can deduce that each minimum cycle surrounding a void forms a convex polygon .",
    "therefore the contact network partitions space into _ locally convex _ regions , with each of these regions being uniquely associated to a void .",
    "the partitioning of space into locally convex regions greatly simplifies the characterization of the underlying structure of the packing and allows us to construct convex tilings associated uniquely with grains and also with the voids .",
    "it is important to note that there is no such semi - circle condition for frictional systems .",
    "the network construction therefore highlights a crucial difference between frictionless and frictional systems .      using the contact vectors",
    ", we can next build a collection of edges @xmath37 defined as @xmath56 where the edges connect pairs of contacts @xmath55 belonging to the grain @xmath14 in a cyclic manner based on their angles ( see fig . [ system_figure ] ) . here",
    "@xmath57 is the edge number associated with the grain , @xmath58 .",
    "we use the convention that the edges circulate in an anti - clockwise manner within each grain .",
    "every contact belonging to a grain therefore has a unique edge associated with it , namely the outgoing edge vector at each contact .",
    "the edges associated with the grains naturally form a @xmath50-sided polygon .",
    "we refer to these embedded polygons as  grain polygons \" .",
    "since we are dealing with convex disks , the associated polygons are also convex and hence have an associated convex area @xmath59 .",
    "the total area covered by the grain polygons is denoted by @xmath60 .",
    "we then have @xmath61 where the edge @xmath57 connects the contacts @xmath55 .",
    "we refer to the individual areas @xmath41 as  edge triangles \" , since they are triangular in shape and are uniquely associated with an edge @xmath57 ( see fig . [ system_figure ] ) .",
    "we measure the statistical properties of these edge triangles in section [ measures_of_order_section ] .",
    "next , we can also use the contact vectors to construct  void polygons \" .",
    "these are created using the edges surrounding each void in the same manner as the grain polygons and have an associated area @xmath62 . for fricitionless packings of disks ,",
    "the convexity of the circumscribing minimum cycle enclosing every void also ensures the convexity of the void polygon .",
    "the edges associated with the void polygons circulate in the clockwise direction .",
    "once again we can define a void connectivity @xmath63 as the total number of edges associated with the void .",
    "an important property of the void polygons is that they circumscribe the voids between the disks , which has a non - convex shape , with a convex polygon . for marginally jammed disks ,",
    "the void polygon is precisely the _ convex hull _ of the non - circular area of the void .",
    "this makes the characterization of the shape and size of individual voids easier .",
    "we note that our void construction is similar to the circulating currents of ball and blumenfeld @xcite , however their assignment of grain areas is different .",
    "our construction is aimed at introducing a grain area parameter that serves as a substitute for the packing fraction , which can then be used to test scaling properties of the system .",
    "we refer to the graph @xmath64 with vertices at the position of contacts and edges formed by the edge vectors as the  polygonal graph \" .      in order to assign a measure to our network",
    ", we use the positions of the grains to construct a triangulation of the two dimensional space .",
    "as we have seen , for frictionless disk packings , the contact network naturally breaks up the space into convex minimum cycles enclosing the voids .",
    "we can then individually triangulate each cycle with the distance vectors @xmath65 that form the convex hull of each cycle , and extra vectors @xmath66 traversing through the minimum cycles .",
    "we refer to these extra triangulation vectors as  fictitious contacts \" since they mostly represent disks that are almost in contact .",
    "it should be noted that the fictitious contacts are infact distance vectors in our convention .",
    "the statistics of these fictitious contacts are of interest to us since they provide significant information about how the contact network is embedded in space .",
    "the union of the individual triangulations then yields a global triangulation @xmath67 with vertices at the position of grains and edges formed by the grain distances and fictitious contacts .",
    "we refer to @xmath68 as the  triangulation graph \" .",
    "the natural triangulation to use within each minimum cycle is the delaunay triangulation @xcite , which maximizes the minimum angle among all possible triangulations .",
    "this forms the least scalene triangulation possible and is convenient for developing discrete calculus frameworks for microscopic properties of granular systems @xcite .",
    "since the union of delaunay triangles yields the convex hull @xcite , this ensures that the distance vectors are a subgraph of the triangulation of each minimum cycle .",
    "therefore the contact network forms a subgraph of the triangulation graph .",
    "this construction is unique since each minimum cycle contains points that are not collinear , ensuring the uniqueness of the individual triangulations .",
    "it is important to note that the union of the individual delaunay triangulations does not necessarily yield the global delaunay triangulation obtained by simply triangulating the vertices of grain positions . for monodisperse disks",
    ", this union does indeed yield the global delaunay triangulation . to show this",
    "it is sufficient to prove that two disks in contact are connected by a global delaunay edge .",
    "this can be proved by recognizing that the delaunay triangulation is simply the adjacency graph of the voronoi tesselation , i.e. if two points share an edge in a voronoi tesselation , they will be connected by a delaunay edge . the voronoi area associated with each vertex @xmath69",
    "is defined as all points @xmath70 such that @xmath71 . for non - overlapping disks ,",
    "the associated circular areas therefore lie within their voronoi areas . at each overlap",
    "the voronoi area of two disks in contact are modified by the amount of overlap , and therefore are adjacent in the voronoi tesselation , leading to them being connected by a delaunay edge .",
    "this property therefore breaks down if one considers highly stressed states with more than two disks in overlap .",
    "it is easy to show that for bidispersed systems with particle radii @xmath72 and @xmath73 with @xmath74 , as @xmath1 the global delaunay triangulation coincides with the union of delaunay triangulations of minimum cycles .",
    "this is true for the bidispersed case with diameter ratio @xmath75 that we simulate . in the case of highly polydisperse systems",
    "the global delaunay triangulation is no longer the best choice , however our construction using the union of minimum cycles still holds . to deal with such cases",
    "several generalizations of voronoi tesselations have been proposed in the literature , the best studied of which is the radical voronoi tesselation @xcite . using this construction , the argument for the monodispersed case",
    "can easily be generalized to systems with varying sizes of disks .",
    "the polygonal graph and the triangulation graph are both representations of the same underlying system .",
    "however , they have different properties .",
    "we list some of the properties for each graph below .      *",
    "the grain polygons and void polygons form a _ bipartite graph _ , i.e. voids are connected to only grains through their edges , and vice versa .",
    "this can also be stated alternatively as the _ adjacency graph _ of grains and voids forms a bipartite network . for the hexagonal close packed structure",
    "this adjacency graph is simply the dice lattice . *",
    "the network is _ space filling _ ,",
    "i.e. + @xmath76 + where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the total areas associated with the grain polygons @xmath79 and the void polygons @xmath80 respectively .",
    "this property differs crucially from other measures of packing fraction used in the literature , that include the excess volumes of overlaps between disks . *",
    "every node has exactly four neighbours ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "every contact has two incoming edges and two outgoing edges since each contact belongs to two grains . *",
    "the network is _ planar _",
    ", i.e. none of the edges formed by the contact vectors cross each other .",
    "this property allows us to use euler s theorem to understand the properties of the graph .      *",
    "the contact network forms a subgraph of the triangulation graph .",
    "this is true by construction ( see section [ delaunay_fictitious_section ] ) . *",
    "the network is _ planar _ ,",
    "i.e. none of the network vectors cross each other .",
    "this property follows directly from the fact that we only consider two - disk overlaps as valid and the properties of the delaunay triangulation @xcite . *",
    "_ triangulation property : _ every triangulation has the following general property @xcite : let @xmath82 be a set of @xmath83 points in the plane , not all collinear , and let @xmath84 denote the number of points in @xmath82 that lie on the boundary of the convex hull of @xmath82 .",

    "can be used to compute the total number of fictitious contacts in the system using the triangulation condition @xmath91 . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we next use the total grain area to study critical exponents of the unjamming transition .",
    "we test the scaling behaviour of the total grain area with two parameters that acquire well defined values at the unjamming transition , namely the energy per grain @xmath1 and the excess coordination @xmath92 .",

    "( [ z_iso_equation ] ) .",
    "we can therefore use the deviations from these two values to test the scaling of the total area @xmath60 .",
    "since the polygonal measure is only sensitive to structural changes in the configurations ( a simple expansion or contraction of all disks is given the same weight ) , it is interesting to see whether we can measure exponents that provide information about the geometric structure of the packings .",
    "we find that this is indeed the case , and that critical exponents measured from grain areas differ from those measured using standard packing fractions .",
