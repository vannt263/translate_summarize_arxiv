    "laser cooling of atoms has become these last years an interesting tool in atom optics ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite for a review of these topics ) .",
    "the production of slow atomic beams and the control of their motion by laser light has opened a variety of applications including matter - wave interferometers @xcite , atomic lenses or atom lithography @xcite . in such experiments , it is often highly desirable to control actively the velocity distribution of an atomic ensemble .",
    "more particularly , devices for narrowing this distribution over a well fixed velocity are very useful to define an atomic beam with a long coherence length ( like in atom lasers @xcite ) .",
    "velocity monochromatization of atomic beams making use of an optical cavity has already been suggested by balykin @xcite . for ultracold atoms , lffler _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite have recently proposed a velocity selector based on a 1d micromaser scheme ( also referred to as mazer ) .",
    "they suggest to send a beam of cold atoms through a microwave cavity in resonance with one of the atomic transitions .",
    "the small velocity of the atoms at the entrance of the micromaser require to quantize their center - of - mass motion to describe correctly their interaction with the cavity quantum field ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite for an overview of quantized motion in quantized fields ) .",
    "this quantization is an essential feature as it leads to a fundamental interplay between their motion and the atom - field internal state @xcite .",
    "it results from this that most of the incoming atoms may be found reflected by the field present in the cavity , except at certain velocities where they can be transmitted through with a reasonable efficiency . at the exit of the cavity",
    ", the longitudinal velocity distribution of the cold atomic beam may be this way significantly narrowed @xcite and a splitting of the atomic wave packet may be observed @xcite .",
    "these effects have been first described by haroche _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite , englert _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite and battocletti and englert @xcite .",
    "they have been recently experimentally observed in the optical domain ( see , for example , pinkse _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the proposal of lffler _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite by considering an off - resonant interaction between the atoms and the cavity field .",
    "this case offers new attractive perspectives for metrology purposes and in the velocity selection scheme .",
    "let us emphasize that this scheme is in no way a proposal to reduce the transverse momentum spread of an atomic beam . for applications where this point is important ( like for example in the case of an atomic beam splitter based on doppleron resonances @xcite ) ,",
    "other schemes like quantum - nondemolition measurement of atomic momentum @xcite should rather be used .",
    "we consider two - level atoms moving along the @xmath0 direction on the way to a cavity of length @xmath1 .",
    "the atoms are coupled off - resonantly to a single mode of the quantized field present in the cavity .",
    "the atomic center - of - mass motion is described quantum mechanically and the usual rotating - wave approximation is made .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the atomic center - of - mass momentum along the @xmath0 axis , @xmath4 the atomic mass , @xmath5 the atomic transition frequency , @xmath6 the cavity field mode frequency , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the upper and lower levels of the two - level atom ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the annihilation and creation operators of the cavity radiation field , @xmath12 is the atom - field coupling strength and @xmath13 is the cavity field mode .",

    "the properties of the mazer have been established in the resonant case by scully and collaborators @xcite .",
    "we extended very recently these studies in the non - resonant case @xcite , especially for the mesa mode function ( @xmath21 inside the cavity , 0 elsewhere ) .",
    "particularly , we have shown that , if the cavity field is prepared in the fock state @xmath22 , an atom initially in the excited state @xmath8 with a momentum @xmath23 will be found transmitted by the cavity in the same state or in the lower state @xmath9 with the respective probabilities @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28^{-1},\\ ] ] @xmath29^{-1},\\ ] ] @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34    the atom transmission in the lower state @xmath9 results in a photon induced emission inside the cavity . in presence of a detuning , these atoms are found to propagate with a momentum @xmath35 different from the initial value @xmath23 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this results merely from the energy conservation .",
    "contrary to the resonant case , the final state of the process @xmath36 has an internal energy different from that of the initial one ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the energy difference @xmath38 is transferred to the atomic kinetic energy . according to the sign of the detuning , the atoms are either accelerated ( @xmath39 , heating process ) or decelerated ( @xmath40 , cooling process ) . in this last case , the initial atomic kinetic energy ( @xmath41 ) must be greater than @xmath38 to ensure that the photon emission may occur .",
    "this justifies the conditional result in eq .",
    "( [ tbnpone ] ) .",
    "in the ultracold regime ( @xmath42 ) and for @xmath43 we have @xmath44 and the total transmission probability @xmath45 simplifies to @xmath46 with @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49    at resonance ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and eq .",

    "their position is given by @xmath58    as the de broglie wavelength is given in the ultracold regime by @xmath59 , this occurs when the cavity length fits a multiple of half the de broglie wavelength @xmath60 of the atom inside the cavity  : @xmath61    the position of the @xmath62 resonance in the @xmath63 space is therefore given by @xmath64    for @xmath65 , a careful analysis of the transmission probability ( [ transmissiont ] ) yields resonance positions slightly shifted from the values given by eq .",

    "the amplitude @xmath68 of a given resonance strongly depends on the detuning value ( see fig .",

    "we have @xmath69    for @xmath65 and according to eq .",
    "( [ tbnpone ] ) , the atom can not leave the cavity in the state @xmath9 .",
    "the system becomes in this case very similar to the elementary problem of the transmission of a structureless particle through a potential well defined by the cavity and the resonance amplitudes reach the value 1 .",
    "same kind of resonances for the transmission probability are observed with respect to the detuning ( see fig .  [ tdsgfig](a ) ) . for realistic experimental parameters ( see discussion in @xcite ) , these resonances may even become extremely narrow .",
    "their width amounts only @xmath70  hz for @xmath71 , @xmath72 khz and @xmath73 .",
    "this could define very useful metrology devices ( atomic clocks for example ) based on a single cavity passage and with better performances than what is usually obtained in the well known ramsey configuration with two cavities or two passages through the same cavity @xcite .    the same curve of the transmission probability is shown on fig .",
    "[ tdsgfig](b ) over an extended scale .",
    "as expected , for very large ( positive or negative ) detunings , the atom - cavity coupling vanishes and the transmission probability tends towards 1 . for large positive detunings , @xmath74 and this behavior is well predicted by eq .",
    "( [ transmissiont ] ) which yields @xmath75 . for large negative detunings , @xmath76 and we get from eq .",
    "( [ transmissiont ] ) @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , when increasing the detuning towards negative values , the system leaves the cold atom regime and switches to the hot atom one . for @xmath78",
    ", this occurs at the detuning value ( see @xcite ) @xmath79    for large negative detunings , eq .",
    "( [ transmissiont ] ) is therefore no more valid and the transmission probability must be computed directly using eqs .",
    "( [ tan ] ) and ( [ tbnpone ] ) .",
    "this explains why the transmission probability changes abruptly at @xmath80 on fig .",
    "[ tdsgfig](b ) , defining this way a well - defined `` window '' where the transmission probability drops to a negligible value .",
    "this window is all the larger since the atoms are initially colder .",
    "if we consider an atomic beam characterized with a velocity distribution @xmath81 , each atom will be transmitted through the cavity with more or less efficiency depending on the @xmath82 value .",
    "the interaction of these atoms with the cavity will lead through the photon emission process to a progressive grow of the cavity photon number . by taking into account the presence of thermal photons and the cavity field damping , meyer _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite have shown that a stationary photon distribution @xmath83 is established inside the cavity .",

[ piffigs ] how a maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( with @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the most probable wave number ) is affected when the atoms are sent through the cavity .",
    "the cavity parameters have been taken identical to those considered in @xcite to underline the detuning effects .",
    "we see from these figures that the final distributions are dominated by a narrow single peak whose position depends significantly on the detuning value .",
    "this could define a very convenient way to select any desired velocity from an initial broad distribution .",
    "also , notice from the @xmath101 scale that a positive detuning significantly enhances the selection process .",
    "such detunings indeed maximize the resonances of the transmission probability through the cavity ( see fig .",
