    "radial oscillations of dense stars ( neutron and strange stars ) were studied by many authors ( see eg .",
    "glass & lindblom ( @xcite ) , vth & chanmugam ( @xcite ) and references therein ) .    in the present paper",
    "we study the radial pulsations of neutron stars and strange quark stars with nuclear crust in the framework of general relativity .",
    "our aim is to present an interesting phenomenon  avoided crossing of this radial modes .",
    "avoided crossing manifest itself as a rapid change of the frequency of the certain oscillatory mode when stellar configuration gradually changes . at this point the frequencies of two consecutive modes",
    "are very close and star `` switches '' the oscillatory properties from one to another .",
    "this effect was previously noticed in the analysis of the _ nonradial _ oscillations in `` ordinary '' stars ( aizenman , smeyers and weigert ( @xcite ) , christensen - dalsgaard ( @xcite ) ) and has been recently discussed by buchler , yecko and kollth ( @xcite ) in the case of radial pulsations of the classical variable stars . for neutron stars",
    "the avoided crossing phenomenon was considered by lee and strohmayer ( @xcite ) for _ nonradial _ oscillations of rotating neutron stars .",
    "the avoided crossings of radial modes in neutron stars was mentioned in our recent paper ( gondek , haensel and zdunik ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) also in the case of hot protoneutron star .    in this paper",
    "we study the avoided crossing phenomenon for two models of dense matter : the low temperature limit of the lattimer and swesty ( @xcite ) equation of state of the neutron matter and the strange quark matter described by the simple bag model .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe equations of state for which we found the avoided crossing phenomenon .",
    "we calculate here also the adiabatic index of the matter which is crucial for the existence of the avoided crossings . in section 3",
    "we present the formulation of the problem of linear , adiabatic , radial pulsations of stars .",
    "we discuss here also the method of determination separately the oscillatory properties of the inner part of a star and the outer regions ( envelope ) .",
    "numerical results for the eigenfrequencies of the lowest modes of radial pulsations of stars are presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 contains a discussion of our results and conclusions .",
    "the starting point for the construction of our equation of state ( eos ) for the neutron star models was the model of hot dense matter of lattimer and swesty ( @xcite ) , hereafter referred to as ls .",
    "actually , we used one specific ls model , corresponding to the incompressibility modulus at the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter @xmath0  mev .",
    "we use ls model of matter in the low temperature limit , which can be treated as a zero - temperature @xmath1 model .",
    "the detailed discussion of the eos and equilibrium conditions is presented in paper i.    as a second example we consider the strange stars with nuclear crust .",
    "the interior of this star is build of strange quark matter , containing nearly equal number of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks .",
    "this matter is described in the framework of the bag model with the value of bag constant @xmath5 ( witten ( @xcite ) , farhi & jaffe ( @xcite ) , haensel , zdunik & schaeffer ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "the crust of a quark star , at densities below neutron drip point ( @xmath6 ) , is represented by the bps equation of state ( baym , pethick & sutherland @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ eos ] we show our equations of state for nuclear and quark matter .",
    "the adiabatic index within the star , @xmath7 , plays a crucial role for oscillatory properties of the star .",
    "the oscillation frequency depends sensitively on the value of the adiabatic index and on the shape of the @xmath8 function .",
    "the increase of @xmath7 means the growing stiffness of the matter leading to the effect of the `` wall '' , setting the bounds for the regions of oscillatory motion .    to calculate properly the oscillations of the star one has to know the relevant index , governing linear perturbation of the pressure due to the density perturbation .",
    "this index will be denoted by @xmath9 .    in the case of a sufficiently cold matter , the reactions between matter constituents are so slow , that the matter composition remains fixed ( frozen ) during perturbations in the dynamical timescale , because @xmath10 . in such a case , the appropriate adiabatic index is @xmath11 i.e. @xmath12 where @xmath13 correspond to the equilibrium model .",
    "fixed value of @xmath14 during oscillatory motion results in freezing of the weak interaction processes ( @xmath15-reactions ) .",
    "the detailed discussion of the relevant adiabatic indices @xmath9 at different physical conditions ( hot protoneutron star with or without trapped neutrinos ) was presented in paper i.    the dependence of @xmath7 s on the pressure in the stellar interior , for our models is displayed in figs .  [ gamn ] ,  [ gamq ] . in this",
    "figures ( and also some next figures ) we choose pressure as an independent variable because pressure is continuous through the star and describes very well some stellar parameters ( e.g. mass above given radius ) .",
    "this is not the case of density @xmath16 , which exhibits large density jump at the crust  core boundary of quark stars .",
    "the stellar configurations in hydrostatic equilibrium are determined by the integration of tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations ( tolman @xcite , oppenheimer & volkoff @xcite ) .    the mass - radius relation for the neutron and quark star models",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ massr ] . in fig .",
    "[ masspc ] we show mass vs. central pressure for our stellar configurations .",
    "the points on the m(r ) curve for neutron stars correspond to the stellar models for which oscillatory properties were studied in details and presented in fig .",
    "[ enerosc ] and discussed in sec .",
    "4 .    to find eigenfrequencies @xmath17 we solve the equations governing infinitesimal radial adiabatic stellar pulsations in general relativity derived by chandrasekhar ( @xcite ) , and rewritten by chanmugan ( @xcite ) in a form , which turns out to be particularly suitable for numerical applications",
    "two important quantities , describing pulsations , are : the relative radial displacement , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the radial displacement of a matter element , and @xmath20  the corresponding lagrangian perturbation of the pressure .",
    "these two quantities are determined from a system of two ordinary differential equations which can be reduced to the one second order ( in @xmath21 ) , linear radial wave equation , of the sturm - liouville type with @xmath22 as the eigenvalue of the sturm - liouville problem . as a result for a given stellar configuration",
    ", we get a set of the eigenvalues @xmath23 with corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath24 where the eigenfunction @xmath25 has @xmath26 nodes within the star , @xmath27 ( see , e.g. , cox @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed form of the equations and solving method is presented in paper i.    to solve linear radial wave equation one needs two boundary conditions .",
    "the condition of regularity at @xmath28 requires @xmath29 the surface of the star is determined by the condition that for @xmath30 , one has @xmath31 .",
    "this implies @xmath32 to study the oscillations of the core end envelope separately we divide the star into two parts : core from the center down to the boundary density @xmath33 and envelope with density smaller than @xmath33 . in the case of neutron matter",
    "the density @xmath33 is defined by the steep change in @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ gamn ] ) and is equal to @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding pressure is equal to @xmath35 . for quark stars the crust ",
    "core boundary is very well defined and connected with huge density jump at the pressure @xmath36 . at this boundary",
    "the density of the crust is equal to @xmath37 and the density of quark core is slightly above @xmath38 .",
    "we have to apply the boundary conditions appropriate for core or envelope pulsations . in the investigation of the core oscillations we stop the integrations of the linear radial wave equation at the @xmath39 with the boundary conditions corresponding to the  free  envelope oscillation with the frequency defined by the central core ",
    "we treat the envelope as a mass @xmath40 laying on the central core and simply moving in a way governed by this central region .",
    "this assumptions leads to the boundary condition in the form :    @xmath41    the oscillation of the envelope we can define by the boundary condition : @xmath42 which means that central core do not move ( in other words @xmath43 ) .",
    "as a result of the numerical integration of linear wave equation with boundary conditions appropriate for three situations ( eqs .",
    "( [ bc1 ] , [ bc2 ] , [ bccore ] , [ bcenv ] ) ) we obtain eigenfrequencies of oscillations for each stellar configuration .    in figs .",
    "[ omegan ] , [ omegaq ] we plotted the eigenfrequencies of the three lowest @xmath44 radial modes versus stellar mass for neutron and quark star oscillations respectively .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a whole star pulsations with boundary conditions at the center and stellar surface ( eqs .",
    "( [ bc1 ] , [ bc2 ] ) ) .",
    "the avoided crossing phenomenon is clearly visible and manifest itself as abrupt , nearly stepwise changes in frequencies of the consecutive ( neighbouring ) oscillation modes .",
    "this effect occurs also in the case of hot , isothermal models of protoneutron stars ( paper i ) .",
    "this stepwise changes of @xmath45 are due to the change of the character of the standing - wave solution for the eigenproblem .",
    "namely , at the avoided crossing point the solution changes from the standing wave localized mainly in the outer layer of the star , to that localized predominantly in the central core .",
    "this is very clearly visible from the comparison with solutions of oscillatory equation for core and crust pulsations separately .",
    "the solid line of the frequency of stellar pulsations nearly coincides with either `` core '' or `` crust '' solutions . with increasing mass of the star the subsequent modes @xmath46 choose between the crust or core solution to fulfill the condition @xmath23 . because of the different dependence @xmath46 for crust and core oscillatory modes this leads to the avoided crossing effect .",
    "the crust region in the stars under consideration is relatively small .",
    "thus the oscillations of the crust could be very well described neglecting the mass of the crust in the gravitational force . in the newtonian limit and for constant @xmath47 throughout the stellar crust the wave equation for crust oscillations can be reduced to the form of bessel equation of the order of @xmath48 defined by the formula : @xmath49 the resulting oscillatory frequency should then be proportional to the gravity at the stellar surface @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the n - th zero of the bessel function @xmath52 of the order of @xmath48 and @xmath53 is gravitational acceleration at the stellar surface .",
    "this approximation agrees very well with our exact numerical results for neutron and quark stars . especially for strange quark stars where @xmath7 is nearly constant and equal to @xmath54 in the large part of the crust ( fig .",
    "[ gamq ] ) the difference between true , numerical results and approximation by the formula ( [ osccru ] ) with @xmath55 is smaller than 5% . in the case of neutron stars due to the changes of @xmath7 through the outer layers",
    "the identification of subsequent oscillatory modes with bessel functions is less accurate , but the linear dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath56 in formula ( [ osccru ] ) holds very well .    to confirm our conclusions",
    "we have studied in details properties of the three lowest radial modes for some stellar configurations .",
    "the parameters of this configurations and eigenfrequencies @xmath45 are presented in figs .",
    "[ massr][masspc ] by dots a  f . in fig .",
    "[ enerosc ] we plotted the energy density of oscillations calculated per pressure gradient in the star i.e. @xmath57 is equal to the energy due to the oscillatory motion of the matter in the sphere @xmath58 .",
    "this function is proportional to @xmath59 . as an independent variable we choose in fig .",
    "[ enerosc ] @xmath60 . for the outer layers of the star",
    "this function is proportional to the relative mass above the radius @xmath61 i.e. : @xmath62 with proportionality constant of the order of unity .",
    "the integral of the energy in fig .",
    "[ enerosc ] is normalized to unity i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ enerosc ] very well visualizes where the mode is localized .",
    "we can also identify modes by the shape of @xmath21 or energy of oscillation .",
    "the three lowest radial `` core modes '' are characterized by the functions presented in row f in fig .",
    "[ enerosc ] .",
    "the stellar configuration f is the most massive and crust plays very little role in oscillatory properties ( see also fig .  [ omegan ] ) .",
    "the two lowest `` crust modes '' correspond to the columns @xmath64 and @xmath65 in row a of fig .  [ enerosc ] .",
    "for the low massive model a the crust is relatively large and determines frequencies for fundamental mode and first overtone .",
    "second overtone @xmath66 is strongly contaminated by the core oscillations ( figs .",
    "[ enerosc ] and [ omegan ] ) .",
    "[ enerosc ] allows for very clear division of oscillatory modes by the real pulsational properties and not the number of nodes .",
    "this is presented in table 1 , where for example a1 denotes configuration a , number of nodes @xmath65 .",
    "llll propagation & fundamental &  first & second + region & mode &  overtone & overtone + crust&a0 b0 c1 e3 &  a1 b2 & + core&b1 c0 d0 e0 f0 &  d2 e1 f1 &  f2 + mixed & +    the identification of the radial modes in table 1 is consistent with the fig .",
    "[ omegan ] . the specific oscillatory mode for stellar configurations a ",
    "f corresponds to the crossection points of the vertical lines at points a  f and the curves @xmath46 for given stellar configuration .",
    "the location of these points very well define type of oscillatory motion .",
    "the nearly constant parts of the @xmath46 functions correspond to the core oscillations while regions of increasing @xmath46 describes crust oscillations .",
    "the region close to avoided crossing points is characteristic to mixed modes : star pulsates in crust as well as in the core .",
    "the avoided crossing phenomenon in the _ radial _ pulsations of dense stellar objects was presented .",
    "both strange quark stars with crust and neutron stars could be subject to this effect .",
    "the main reason for the abrupt changes of the oscillatory properties of the star as one change a little stellar configuration is the very well defined division of the star into two regions : inner core and outer crust .",
    "this two parts have different equation of state and oscillatory properties .",
    "the latter have been studied in this paper by the separation of the outer and inner regions by appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "resulting oscillatory frequencies of crust and core pulsations depend on the stellar configurations ( e.g. mass of the star ) in completely different manner .",
    "the functions @xmath67 are rather steeply increasing while @xmath68 are nearly constant ( neutron stars ) or decreasing ( quark stars ) .",
    "the oscillatory properties of the star could be characteristic either to the crust or core pulsations .",
    "the frequency spectrum depends on the mass of the star .",
    "the core pulsations determine the oscillatory properties of the lower order radial modes for relatively massive neutron or strange stars .",
    "the star could be subject to the crust pulsations for sufficiently high frequency or low stellar mass . for given mass the fundamental mode of crust oscillations @xmath69 define the frequency below which the star pulsates in the core ( figs .",
    "[ omegan ] , [ omegaq ] ) .",
    "the avoided crossing phenomenon is strongly related to the changes of compressibility of the matter throughout the star , which is described by the shape of the @xmath70 function .",
    "the increase of the stiffness of the matter outward leads to the maximum of @xmath70 close to the boundary between core and crust . in the case of strange quark matter",
    "this is the consequence of the the fact that it is self - bound at the very high density and @xmath71 as @xmath72 . in neutron matter described by ls equation of state the symmetry energy leads to the increase of @xmath14 inward and in this case more symmetric matter is softer .",
    "the same effect could be seen for the field model of dense matter considered by diaz alonso and ibez ( @xcite ) .",
    "the function @xmath8 for their eoss ( fig . 9 of their paper ) resembles ls result at low temperature limit .",
