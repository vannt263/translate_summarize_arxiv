    "massive stars have a huge influence on their environments via stellar winds and their final explosions . however , we currently do not know with any degree of certainty , which massive stars produce which type of supernova ( sn ) .",
    "the evolution of a massive star ( @xmath0 @xmath1 40 @xmath2 ) is generally believed to be _ driven _ by mass loss , as described in the `` conti '' scenario : o @xmath3 luminous blue variable ( lbv ) @xmath3 wolf - rayet ( wr ) star ( maeder , this meeting ) , where the wr stars include both nitrogen - rich ( wn ) and carbon - rich ( wc ) stars .",
    "mass loss determines the stellar mass before collapse and is thus relevant for the type of compact remnant that is left behind ( i.e. neutron star or black hole ) .",
    "this process is expected to depend on the metal content ( @xmath4 ) of the host galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , as wr stars are the likely progenitors of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , the strength of wr winds as a function of @xmath4 is especially relevant for setting the threshold @xmath4 for forming grbs .    given the crucial role that mass - loss plays for massive star evolution , we have computed mass - loss rates using a monte carlo method , described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we discuss the predictions in sects .  2 - 4 in order of decreasing temperature : wr stars @xmath3 ob supergiants @xmath3 lbvs . in sects .  5 and 6",
    ", we link our mass - loss predictions with certain types of radio sne .",
    "conclusions and outlook are in sect .  7 .",
    "in recent years , it has become clear that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are associated with the final explosion of a massive star , providing enormous impetus to the collapsar model @xcite .",
    "the model works best if the progenitor fulfils two criteria : ( i ) the absence of a thick hydrogen envelope ( so that the jet can emerge ) , and ( ii ) rapid rotation of the core ( so that a disk can form )",
    ". this may point towards a rapidly rotating wr star .",
    "in the so - called `` conti '' scenario @xcite , wr stars are the result of mass - loss during earlier evolutionary phases , while in a complementary scenario , the removal of the hydrogen envelope may be due to a companion .",
    "recently , an alternative scenario for producing a grb progenitor has gained popularity @xcite : when a star rotates rapidly , it may mix `` quasi homogeneously '' , and evolve along a track that more or less coincides with the zero age main sequence .",
    "a problem for producing a grb within this scenario however , is that the wr stars in the galaxy possess strong winds , which may remove the angular momentum @xcite , making it challenging , if not impossible , to produce a grb at galactic @xmath4 .",
    "this however might not be an issue if wr winds are weaker at low @xmath4 , so the question is : `` are the winds of wr stars @xmath4-dependent ? '' and if so , `` how strong is this dependence ? ''",
    "the dense winds of wr stars are likely driven by radiation pressure @xcite , just like their less extreme o star counterparts , which have been known to be driven by radiation pressure since the early 1970s .",
    "this in itself need not necessarily imply that wr winds depend on metal content .",
    "wr stars produce copious amounts of metals such as carbon ( in wc stars ) .",
    "if , on the one hand , these self - enriched elements dominate the driving ( by their sheer number of particles ) , one would expect wr winds to be independent of their initial @xmath4 and the requirements of the collapsar model may never be met .",
    "if , on the other hand , iron ( fe ) is largely responsible for the driving ( as in o stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , wr winds might indeed be less efficient in low @xmath4 environments .    to address the question regarding the @xmath4 dependence of wr winds , @xcite computed mass - loss rates for late - type wn and wc stars as a function of the initial metal content ( representative of the host galaxy ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f_wnwc ] . for a discussion of the flattening in the mass - loss-@xmath4 dependence for initial metallicities below log ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6 and potential consequences for the first stars ( pop iii ) ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite , but for the @xmath4 range down to log ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6 , the mass loss is found to drop steeply , as @xmath7@xmath8 @xmath9 , for the wn phase - where wr stars spend most of their time .",
    "this inefficiency of wr mass loss at subsolar @xmath4 may prevent the loss of stellar angular momentum , providing a boost to the collapsar model .",
    "we switch from a discussion of mass - loss versus @xmath4 to a discussion of mass loss versus @xmath10 .",
    "this is best described in terms of the wind efficiency number @xmath11 , a measure for the momentum transfer from the photons to the ions in the wind . here",
    "@xmath12  is the terminal velocity of the outflow and @xmath13 the luminosity of the star .",
    "@xcite computed wind models as a function of effective temperature as shown in fig .  [ f_eta ] .",
    "the overall behaviour is one of decreasing @xmath14 with decreasing @xmath10  due to a growing mismatch between the wavelengths of the maximum opacity ( in the uv ) and the flux ( moving to longer wavelengths ) .",
    "the behaviour reverses at the `` bistability jump '' ( bsj ; e.g. lamers et al .",
    "1995 ) , where @xmath14 increases by a factor of 2 - 3 , as feiv recombines to feiii @xcite .    recent mass - loss studies @xcite have reconfirmed discrepancies between empirical mass - loss rates and predictions for b supergiants @xcite .",
    "discrepancies have also been reported for o stars @xcite , and it is as yet unclear whether the reported discrepancies for b supergiants could be due to model assumptions ( e.g. the neglect of wind clumping ) or the physical reality of the bsj . the most accurate way to derive @xmath7  is believed to be through radio observations .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite present empirical radio mass - loss rates as a function of effective temperature that show a similar behaviour to the mass - loss efficiency predicted by @xcite .",
    "this may well be the first evidence of the presence of a mass - loss bsj at the boundary between o and b supergiants .",
    "the relevance for stellar evolution is that when massive stars evolve to lower @xmath10  after the o star main sequence phase , they are expected to cross the bsj .",
    "interestingly , lbvs brighter than log ( @xmath15 ) @xmath16 ( see fig .  [ f_smith ] ) are expected to encounter it continuously - on timescales of their photometric variability , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "lbvs are unstable massive stars in the upper part of the hrd ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f_smith ] , the classical lbvs , like ag car , are anticipated to cross the bsj at @xmath17 21000 k. one of the defining characteristics for lbvs is their s  doradus ( sd ) variation of @xmath171  2 mag on timescales of years ( short sd phases ) to decades ( long sd phases ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite computed lbv mass - loss rates as a function of @xmath10- shown in fig .  [ f_ag ] .",
    "overplotted are the empirical mass - loss rates for ag car @xcite , which vary on the timescales of the photometric variability .",
    "although the agreement is not perfect ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) , the amplitude of the predicted variability fits the observations well , and most importantly the overall behaviour appears to be very similar , and may indeed be explained in terms of the physics of the bsj .",
    "this bi - stable behaviour in an individual stellar wind @xcite causes the star to flip back and forth between two states : that of a low mass loss , high - velocity wind , to a high mass - loss , low velocity wind",
    ". the wind density ( @xmath18 ) would therefore be expected to change by a factor of @xmath172  @xmath19  @xmath172 , i.e. @xmath174 on the timescale of the sd variations . in the absence of any other material around the star",
    ", this would result in a pattern of concentric shells of varying density .",
    "radio sne ( rsne ) lightcurves and the model for sn interaction with the surrounding circumstellar material has been reviewed by @xcite , and is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ f_sketch ] .",
    "the radio emission is due to non - thermal electrons , while the absorption may be due to both synchrotron self absorption as well as free - free absorption .",
    "examples of the rise , peak , and power - law decline of radio lightcurves are shown in fig .",
    "[ f_soder ] .",
    "( the episodic bumps at late time are discussed in sect .",
    "[ s_quasi ] )    the model constrains the wind density and thus the ratio of @xmath7  to the terminal wind velocity : @xmath20 .",
    "assuming @xmath21 , @xcite list @xmath7  values in the range @xmath22@xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "fortunately , these values agree with mass - loss predictions , but are broadly representative for massive stars over almost all post - main sequence evolutionary phases , making it hard to infer the progenitor from radio lightcurves alone , unless these lightcurves betray their progenitor in some other way .",
    "a number of recent rsne have shown sinusoidal modulations in their radio lightcurves , in particular sn2001ig @xcite and sn2003bg @xcite are strikingly similar in terms of both amplitude and variability timescale ( see fig .",
    "[ f_soder ] ) .",
    "the recurrence timescale @xmath25 of the bumps is @xmath17 150 days . using eq .",
    "( 13 ) from @xcite :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the deceleration parameter ( here @xmath27 = 0.85 ) and @xmath28 is the time of measurement of the ejecta velocity relative to the moment of the explosion . assuming @xmath29 = 1020@xmath30 , typical wind velocities for red ( super)giants , @xcite found a period @xmath31 between successive mass - loss phases that was too long for red ( super)giant pulsations ( 100s of days ) , but too short for thermal pulses ( 10@xmath3210@xmath33 years ) .",
    "they therefore invoked an edge - on , eccentric binary scenario involving a wr - star and a massive companion .",
    "one of the main differences between lbv and red giant winds is that lbv winds are about 10 times faster . if the progenitor of sn2001ig were an lbv , the expected period between successive mass - loss episodes would be @xmath3425yr ( for an assumed @xmath35  =  200@xmath30 ) , consistent with the long sd phase @xcite .",
    "@xcite infer density enhancements of a factor of @xmath172 during the deviations from pure power - law evolution .",
    "they consider a range of options that might account for the modulations , but they favour a single - star progenitor model of a wr star that underwent episodes of intensified mass loss .",
    "however , they do not specify the physical mechanism that gives rise to these periods of enhanced mass loss .",
    "our sd mechanism for lbvs may alleviate this shortcoming .",
    "are lbvs viable sne progenitors ?",
    "it may be relevant that both sne2001ig and 2003bg are `` transitional '' objects .",
    "sn2001ig was initially classified as type ii ( showing h lines ) but metamorphosed into a type ib / c object ( no h lines , weak he lines ) about 9 months later .",
    "this suggests that it has lost most of its h - rich envelope .",
    "sn2003bg however was first classified as a type ic , but within a month the spectrum evolved into a type ii sn .",
    "this transitional behaviour hints at the fact that their progenitors are intermediate evolutionary objects : h - rich compared to ob / red ( super)giants , but h - poor compared to wr stars .",
    "lbvs are likely candidates .    during this meeting , there was discussion about clumping in o star winds .",
    "the value for the clumping factor in o star winds is very much an open issue .",
    "if these factors would be much larger than two , this would have severe implications for massive star evolution .",
    "one consequence might be that giant lbv eruptions ( @xmath14 car type eruptions , not the typifying sd variations ) dominate the integrated mass loss during evolution @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario could be that post - main sequence stars do not become wr stars , but explode early  during their lbv phase .    here ,",
    "we have presented indications that at least those sne that show quasi - periodic modulations in their radio lightcurves might have lbv progenitors @xcite .",
    "it has also been speculated that lbvs may be the generic progenitors of type iin sne @xcite , however the type iin phenomenon ( arising from sn ejecta expanding into dense circumstellar matter ) may be relevant to both core - collapse and thermonuclear sne @xcite , and although it may be reasonable to expect that some type iin sne have lbv progenitors , there remains a lot of work to be done to prove this .",
    "nonetheless , it appears that the `` standard scenario '' for massive star evolution may need revision .",
    "future mass - loss predictions will certainly play a major role in adjusting even our most basic knowledge of massive star evolution ."
