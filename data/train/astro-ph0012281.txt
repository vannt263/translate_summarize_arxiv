    "relative to other fields , explosive nucleosynthesis is propably unique in its requirements of a very large number of ( nuclear- ) physics quantities in order to achieve a satisfactory description of the astrophysical phenomena under study . because nuclei of extreme n / z composition exist in explosive environments , an understanding of their nuclear - structure properties",
    "has always been and still is a stimulating challenge to the experimental and theoretical cosmo - chemistry and nuclear - physics community .",
    "about 40 years ago , charles d. coryell , in his important but widely unrecognized article on _  the chemistry of creation of the heaviest elements  _",
    "@xcite , has summarized his ideas about the importance of shell - structure from the 1950 s for the formation of elements of mass number a@xmath070 by rapid neutron capture . starting with the realization , that historically _ ",
    "chemists have been interested from time immemorial in the chemical composition of the world around us  _ , he emphasizes the importance of the neutron shell - closures at n=50 , 82 and 126 for the time - scale of the fast neutron - capture process and the _  r - process pile - up ",
    "_ at the bromine , xenon and platinum peaks of suess and urey s so - called  cosmic abundances  @xcite . as _  primary antecedent _ ( odd - z ) _ species with n=50  _ , already at that time coryell favours @xmath1cu and @xmath2ga .",
    "he considers these isotopes out of experimental reach , because they are _  even more neutron - rich than primary fission products_. on the basis of their isobaric _  displacement from the valley of stability ",
    "_ , he estimates a half - life of about 0.1  s. similarly , for n=82 , coryell suggests that the decay of the precursors @xmath3rh , @xmath4ag and @xmath5 in forms the top of the a@xmath6130 abundance peak ; and for a@xmath6195 peak _  topped by @xmath7pt ",
    "_ he assigns @xmath7tm as the primary n=126 nucleus . with his further assumption _  that the energy of first decay , and thus the probable half - life for the decay , stays about constant ",
    "_ along the r - process path , the total time required for a steady - state build - up of heavy nuclides from fe to u would be roughly 6.5  s. it is interesting to compare this estimate with the contemporary one of burbidge et al .",
    "@xcite of about 80  s.    today , we know that the r - process matter flow is not constant .",
    "it is fast in the mass regions between the magic neutron numbers , whereas the shell - closures act as  bottle - necks  . here , at n=50 , 82 and 126 , each",
    ", the classical r - process needs several hundred milliseconds to pass these regions , thereby building up the well known r - abundance peaks observed in the solar system ( n@xmath8 ) .",
    "therefore , the nuclear - physics input to these n@xmath8 maxima is still today of particular importance for the understanding of r - process nucleosynthesis , independent of its stellar site .",
    "still some 15 years ago , astrophysicists believed that nuclear - structure information on r - process nuclei , lying 14 ( @xmath9ni ) to 36 ( @xmath10eu ) mass units away from the @xmath11-stability line , would never be accessible to experiments on earth .",
    "however , continued progress in ion - source and mass - separator technology has soon after resulted in the identification of the first two classical , neutron - magic  waiting - point  isotopes @xcite , @xmath12zn@xmath13 and @xmath14cd@xmath15 at osiris , tristan and isolde , respectively @xcite . as was shown in @xcite , with their @xmath11-decay properties first evidence for the existence of the earlier postulated n@xmath8(z)@xmath16@xmath17(z)@xmath18const .",
    "correlation could be achieved .",
    "we would , however , remind the r - process laymen that this is a rather crude correlation based on simple * static * calculations with the assumption of constant neutron - separation energies ( s@xmath19 ) for all ( n@xmath20 + 1 ) nuclei at the  staircases  associated with the rising sides of the n@xmath8 peaks ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "v,3 in @xcite , or figs . 9 and 10 in @xcite ) . in this approach , exclusively the @xmath11-decay rate",
    "( @xmath21@xmath22 ) or the half - life ( t@xmath23=ln2/@xmath21@xmath22 ) of the neutron - magic nuclides are of importance . nevertheless , at those times",
    "when the predictions for the t@xmath23 of n=82 @xmath14cd , for example , varied between 30  ms and 1.2  s , our experimental value of t@xmath23=(196@xmath2435 )  ms was of considerable importance to constrain the equilibrium conditions of an r - process within the above approximation .",
    "the result of such calculations of the a@xmath6130 n@xmath8 peak some 1015 years ago is depicted in fig .",
    "[ klk1 ] . in the left part",
    ", straightforward t@xmath23 calculations are shown using the quasi - particle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) of ref .",
    "@xcite with folded - yukawa wave functions , a lipkin - nogami pairing model and the ( presumably too low ) masses from an early version of the 1995 finite - range droplet model ( frdm ) @xcite , but neglecting proton - neutron ( p - n ) residual interaction . for comparison ,",
    "in the right part of this figure , our again static r - abundance calculations from the early 1990 s with experimental data on @xmath25 in and @xmath14cd and an improved qrpa version , now taking into account effects of the p - n interaction are depicted ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . nowadays , with our largely improved knowledge on nuclear masses and @xmath11-decay properties of nuclei far from stability as input for time - dependent  canonical  or dynamical r - process network calculations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the above simplistic static picture should therefore no longer be used for abundance simulations .    in any case , the experimental success in the late 1980 s strongly motivated further experimental and theoretical nuclear - structure investigations and its possible astrophysical implications .",
    "for example , the second n=50 waiting - point isotope @xmath1cu could be identified @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the measured high delayed - neutron emission probabilities ( p@xmath19 ) of odd - z r - process nuclei just beyond n=50 were shown to be the nuclear - structure origin of the odd - even staggering in the n@xmath8 peak at a@xmath680 @xcite ; and from the interpretation of the @xmath12zn@xmath13 decay scheme , first evidence for a vanishing of the spherical n=50 shell closure far from stability was obtained @xcite .    since the late 1980 s , important progress has been achieved in the understanding of the systematics and development of nuclear - structure with increasing neutron excess ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , with cern - isolde always playing a leading role in this field .",
    "however , due to the generally very low production yields , the restriction to chemically non - selective ionization modes , or the application of non - selective detection methods , no further information on isotopes lying * on * the r - process path could be obtained for quite some time . only in recent years , the identification of additional r - process nuclides has become possible thanks to considerable improvements of the * selectivity * in production and detection methods of rare isotopes , e.g. by applying resonance - ionisation laser ion - source ( rilis ) systems .",
    "today , there are mainly three mass regions , where nuclear - structure properties of specific interest to r - process nucleosynthesis can be studied experimentally .",
    "the first is the classical r - process seed region involving very neutron - rich fe - group isotopes in the vicinity of the doubly-(semi-)magic nuclei @xmath26ni@xmath27 and @xmath28ni@xmath13 .",
    "recent spectroscopic results can , for example , be found in @xcite .",
    "the second region is that of far - unstable nuclei around a@xmath6115 . here , most canonical r - process calculations show a pronounced r - abundance trough , which we believe to be due to nuclear - model deficiencies in predicting ground - state shapes and masses at and beyond n=72 mid - shell ( see , e.g. @xcite )",
    ". recent experimental information on that mass range can be found , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the third region of interest , on which the main focus of this paper has been put , is that around the doubly - magic nucleus @xmath29sn@xmath15 .",
    "apart from its astrophysical importance ( _ the r - process matter flow through the a@xmath6130 n@xmath8 peak _ )",
    "@xcite , this area is of considerable shell - structure interest .",
    "the isotope @xmath30sn itself , together with the properties of the nearest - neighbour single - particle ( @xmath31sb@xmath15 and @xmath32sn@xmath33 ) and single - hole ( @xmath34sn@xmath35 and @xmath36in@xmath15 ) nuclides are essential for tests of the shell model , and as input for future nuclear - structure calculations towards the neutron - drip line .    the bulk of data so far known in this mass region have been obtained from @xmath11-decay spectroscopy at the mass - separator facilities osiris and isolde @xcite . during the past few years , new data  northeast  of @xmath30sn were published also from spontaneous - fission studies of @xmath37 cm ( see , e.g. , korgul et al .",
    "@xcite , and refs .",
    "therein ) . with respect to the closest neighbours of @xmath30sn ,",
    "the structures of @xmath5sn@xmath35 ( @xmath38-hole ) and @xmath31sb ( @xmath39-particle ) are fairly well known since more than a decade .",
    "more recently , the lowest @xmath38-particle states in @xmath40sn@xmath33 have been identified at the general purpose separator ( gps ) of the ps - booster isolde facility ( see , e.g. , hoff et al .",
    "@xcite ) . from these data ,",
    "valuable information on the spin - orbit splitting of the 2f- and the 3p - orbitals was obtained .",
    "these results were compared to mean - field and hfb predictions , and it was found that none of the potentials used in the past in _ ab inito _ shell - structure calculations was capable of properly reproducing the ordering and spacing of these states .    with these new data , the close @xmath30sn valence - nucleon region is nearly complete .",
    "the only missing information are the @xmath39-hole states in @xmath36 in , which can in principle be studied through @xmath11-decay of the exotic nucleus @xmath5cd@xmath33 .",
    "off - line test experiments to find a well - suited excitation scheme for resonance ionization of cd were initially carried out in mainz @xcite ; and first results on t@xmath23 data and delayed - neutron emission probabilities ( p@xmath19 ) of n=82 to 84 @xmath41cd using a similar laser system were obtained at isolde .",
    "a detailed discussion of the initially quite surprising results for n=83 @xmath5cd and n=84 @xmath30cd can be found in ref .",
    "already these gross properties indicate again that the structure below and beyond @xmath30sn is not at all well understood by now . of direct astrophysical importance",
    "is our new measurement of the n=82 waiting - point nucleus @xmath14cd .",
    "its considerably improved half - life of t@xmath23=(167@xmath247 ) ms is somewhat lower than our old value from 1986 of ( 195@xmath2435 ) ms @xcite , but still lies within the error limits given at that time . the measured p@xmath19 value of ( 3.5@xmath241.0 ) @xmath42 is in agreement with our earlier estimate .",
    "another important observation with respect to the calculation of @xmath11-decay properties of so far unknown n@xmath682 r - process waiting - point isotopes is that model predictions of q@xmath43 values in the region  south  of @xmath30sn differ considerably , with the general tendency that those models which exhibit a strong n=82 shell closure ( e.g. , frdm @xcite or etfsi-1 @xcite ) , give the  lower  values .",
    "recent increasing experimental evidence of a weakening of the classical shell - structure below @xmath30sn ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , however , seem to favour the systematically higher q@xmath43 predictions from mass models with  shell - quenching ",
    "( e.g. , hfb / skp@xcite or etfsi - q@xcite ) below @xmath30sn .",
    "this trend is of particular importance for the t@xmath23 and p@xmath19 predictions of z@xmath4450 , n=82 r - process waiting - point nuclei .",
    "sizeable differences in the q@xmath22 values between un - quenched and quenched mass models start at @xmath5 in with @xmath45q@xmath22@xmath6400  kev , continue via @xmath14cd to @xmath3rh with about 1 mev , and range down to @xmath46zr with @xmath45q@xmath22@xmath64  mev , resulting in considerable changes in theoretical t@xmath23 for these isotopes . for @xmath14cd , for example , the t@xmath23(qrpa ) with q@xmath22(etfsi - q)=8.30  mev is a factor 2.5 shorter than with q@xmath22(frdm)=7.43  mev .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that the same trend is competely independently predicted also by very recent shell - model calculations of b.a .",
    "brown et al . @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to solve the above discrepancies , high - precision mass measurements in the region below @xmath30sn are foreseen at isolde using the penning - trap mass spectrometer isoltrap . in any case , in our more recent r - process calculations , we prefer to use newly calculated t@xmath23(gt+ff ) values , which supercede our 1996 evaluation @xcite applied in earlier r - process studies .",
    "it should be pointed out in this context , that already since the early 1990 s our astrophysics collaboration uses steadily updated evaluations of experimental and theoretical t@xmath23 and p@xmath19 values , in which the calculated gross properties are based on the frdm mass and deformation parameters @xcite and contain a microscopic gt - strength @xcite and a schematic ff - strength @xcite . for neutron - rich a@xmath6130 isotopes ,",
    "this led already in the past to shorter t@xmath23 and smaller p@xmath19 values than listed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we would appreciate if the rather general statement in a number of recent papers that some new shell - model half - lives are significantly shorter than those _  currently adopted in r - process simulations ",
    "_ could be put more precisely in the future . at least , as far as our basel ",
    "los alamos ",
    "mainz collaboration is concerned , our theoretical t@xmath23(gt+ff ) are quite similar to the new shell - model values .",
    "hence , statements that those new values would speed up the r - matter flow in the neutron - magic bottle - neck regions do not concern our calculations .",
    "another recent study of nuclear - structure developments towards n=82 is related to the @xmath11dn- and @xmath47-spectroscopic measurements of neutron - rich ag nuclides at cern - isolde , again using an optimized rilis system for this element .",
    "this z - selectivity was of considerable assistance in minimizing the activities from unavoidable surface - ionized in and cs isobars . in this context , the additional selectivity of the spin- and moment - dependent hyperfine ( hf ) splitting was used to enhance the ionization of either the @xmath39p@xmath23 isomer or the @xmath39g@xmath48 ground - state ( g.s . ) decay of the ag isotopes .",
    "details about first @xmath11dn- and @xmath47-spectroscopic applications of this technique to short - lived isomers of @xmath46ag up to the classical n=82 r - process waiting - point nuclide @xmath4ag can be found , e.g. in @xcite . because of its importance for r - process calculations , in particular for the time spent in the a@xmath6130 n@xmath8 peak region , some details about the difficulties in the measurement of this latter isotope are given . only after fine - tuning the lasers to an off - center frequency leading to an enhancement of the ionization of the @xmath39g@xmath48 level relative to the @xmath39p@xmath23 state , an unambiguous identification of the g.s .",
    "@xmath11dn - decay of @xmath4ag with a t@xmath23=(46@xmath49 ) ms was possible ( see , e.g. fig .  10 in @xcite ) . the measured t@xmath23(g.s .",
    ") value is longer than our initial qrpa(nilsson / bcs ) estimate of 15  ms , but is in good agreement with our more recent qrpa(fy / ln ) prediction @xcite and two subsequent shell - model calculations of refs .",
    "however , the measured t@xmath23(g.s . ) is lower than our old static waiting - point _",
    "requirement _ of about 130  ms @xcite . within this simple approach ,",
    "the 46  ms would not be enough to build - up the @xmath4xe r - abundance to its solar value ( see the left part of fig .",
    "[ klk1 ] in this context ) , but  as we will see later ( in figs .  [ klk3],[klk4 ] )  for more realistic dynamic calculations with ( non - constant ) s@xmath19 values , e.g. from the etfsi - q mass model , the measured t@xmath23(g.s . ) for @xmath4ag fits much better .",
    "furthermore , when requiring a really  perfect  fit at a=129 one will have to consider also smaller effects from non - equilibrium phases of the r - process , e.g. neutron capture and neutrino processing during freeze - out .",
    "under such conditions , also the t@xmath23 contribution from the @xmath39p@xmath23 isomer might be of importance for the residual  stellar  half - life of @xmath4ag .",
    "we calculate a value of t@xmath23(gt+ff)@xmath6125 ms for this isomer , in reasonable agreement with the very recent shell - model prediction of 89  ms by b.a .",
    "brown . as is discussed e.g. in @xcite , with an isomeric half - life in this range , a stellar t@xmath23@xmath66072  ms would result after neutron capture on @xmath50ag to form an excited @xmath4ag nucleus , which then @xmath47-cascades down to the isomer and the g.s . and , indeed , a careful comparison of the a=129 @xmath11dn - decay curves taken under  laser - off  and  laser - on  conditions at central frequency , gave a first indication of a weak , longer - lived @xmath4ag component with a t@xmath23 in the range 80160  ms .",
    "now , it will be important to use isomer - specific ionization in combination with isobar separation at the high - resolution separator ( hrs ) of isolde to ascertain the existence of this @xmath39p@xmath23 isomer with a half - life different from the g.s .- decay .",
    "because of space limitations , our @xmath47-spectroscopic data on the decay of heavy ag isotopes , in particular the extension of the 2@xmath51 and 4@xmath51 level systematics up to @xmath50cd and tentatively to n=82 @xmath14cd , can not be discussed here .",
    "therefore , we only mention that our data indicate a weakening of the spherical n=82 shell below doubly - magic @xmath30sn , as predicted by some theories . for details , we refer to our recent publications @xcite .",
    "finally , also our very recent first experiment on the decays of very neutron - rich sn isotopes , again using rilis at isolde , should be mentioned @xcite .",
    "the data are not yet fully analyzed , but already now the new @xmath11-decay properties of @xmath52sn indicate that they may help to improve our r - abundance fits in the a=134 to a=140 mass region ( see figs .",
    "[ klk3],[klk4 ] ) .",
    "in particular since the recent astronomical observations of the possible existence of ( at least ) two r - process components from different sites , a * primary main * r - process responsible for the heavy elements between cd and the th  u region @xcite , and a * secondary weak * r - process requested to produce the lighter elements in and beyond the a@xmath680 peak @xcite , the n=82 , a@xmath6130 waiting - point region has gained additional importance as the _ first _ bottle - neck in the main - component r - matter flow . now  without the n=50 , a@xmath680 peak  the xe  te peak determines to a considerable extent the total time needed for this process in the ( still favourably discussed ) sn  ii scenario ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "based on our new experimental t@xmath23 and p@xmath19 values for @xmath14cd and @xmath4ag , together with the considerably improved understanding of the nuclear - structure properties in the @xmath30sn region which have been incorporated into our recent qrpa calculations for the so far unknown ( z@xmath4447 ) n=82 waiting - point isotopes , a quite satisfactory reproduction of the total r - abundance curve can be obtained in time - dependent , multi - component  canonical  r - process calculations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    since we want to focus here on the n=82 waiting - point region , we present in figs .",
    "[ klk3],[klk4 ] , a cut - out in linear scale of our latest @xmath11-flow r - abundance calculations .",
    "they are plotted together with the latest n@xmath8  residuals  from the compilation of arlandini et al .",
    "@xcite . from a comparison of these figures",
    ", one can draw several conclusions which may clarify the situation about the build - up of the a@xmath6130 n@xmath8 peak and the time needed to overcome this bottle - neck towards heavier r - isotopes . in fig .",
    "[ klk3 ] , we first show two  fits  with the initial simplistic assumption of constant s@xmath19=2  mev values for all n=83 isotopes between @xmath27zr and @xmath53 in , in one case  normalized  to the top of the n@xmath8 peak at a=130 ( left part , where n=82 @xmath14cd is the main progenitor ) and in the other case to the bottom of the left wing of the peak at a=125 ( right part , where n=82 @xmath54tc is the main progenitor ) .",
    "one can easily imagine that both presentations may give rise to completely misleading interpretations .",
    "the assumption of a direct t@xmath23n@xmath8 correlation , would  on the one hand ",
    "imply that * only * @xmath14cd , @xmath5 in and the major part of @xmath4ag would be synthesized in @xmath11-flow equilibrium ( see left side of fig .",
    "[ klk3 ] ) ; on the other hand , all n=82 isotopes between @xmath55mo up to @xmath50pd would be produced in a steady flow , but not @xmath4ag to @xmath5 in ( see right part of fig .",
    "[ klk3 ] ) . at this point ,",
    "i can not refrain to point out , that this latter picture is the basis for the recent conclusions of refs .",
    "these authors argue that _  the time spent at the n=82 waiting point is shorter than previously assumed  _ and _  @xmath4ag and @xmath14cd can not be produced in @xmath11-flow equilibrium_. as demonstrated above , this conclusion is at least carried too far , if not wrong .",
    "therefore , it is by all means unjustified to further conclude that their above result would imply _  that the n=82 and n=126 r - process peaks are made at two distinct sites_. in any case , if the above authors were right , their conclusions would detract our contribution to the success in measuring r - process waiting - point nuclei , simply because other nuclear - physics quantities , such as neutron - capture cross sections , would substitute for the astrophysical significance of the @xmath11-decay properties in equilibrium scenarios .    in fig .",
    "[ klk4 ] , we now present the results obtained with s@xmath19 values from the etfsi - q mass model , for the n=83 isotones varying between 0.01  mev for @xmath27zr via 1.09  mev for @xmath56ru to 2.22  mev for @xmath57cd . for further comparison ,",
    "the left part shows the initial r - abundances of the waiting - point nuclei prior to @xmath11-decay back to stability ; and in the right part the final r - abundances of the stable isobars after back - decay are depicted .",
    "it is evident already from the first glance , that with this approach the n@xmath8 pattern of the whole n=82 waiting - point region between a=125 and a=133 is much better reproduced than under the simplified conditions leading to the two fits shown in fig .",
    "[ klk3 ] . since exactly the same @xmath11-decay quantities ( t@xmath23 and p@xmath19 ) and astrophysics parameters ( stellar temperature , neutron density , flow - time and weighting of the individual r - components ) have been used , the improvements are clearly due to the increasing s@xmath19 values of the ( n@xmath20 + 1 ) isotopes on the rising part of the a@xmath6130 peak .",
    "those n=82 waiting - point isotopes at the bottom of the peak  with correspondingly  low ",
    "s@xmath19(n=83 ) values ",
    "collect r - abundance fractions for a much larger neutron - density range than the ones at the top of the peak with ",
    "s@xmath19(n=83 ) values . to be more specific , while in the @xmath58pd isotopic chain n=82 @xmath59pd is the major waiting - point nucleus up to n@xmath19@xmath610@xmath60  @xmath61 , the magic shell in the ag chain is already passed at n@xmath19@xmath610@xmath62  @xmath61 and in the cd chain even as early as n@xmath19@xmath610@xmath63  @xmath61 . around n@xmath19@xmath610@xmath62  @xmath61 , the actual waiting - point in the cd isotopic chain is 96  ms n=84 @xmath30cd @xcite . around n@xmath19@xmath610@xmath60  @xmath61 ,",
    "even n=86 @xmath64cd takes over , and in the ag chain n=84 @xmath5ag becomes the waiting - point nucleus .",
    "hence , the final picture shown in the right part of fig .  [ klk4 ] represents the sum of several ( here altogether 16 ) partial equilibria , each for a definite neutron density , respectively r - process path .",
    "one may extend this discussion also to the regions below and beyond the actual abundance peak , where still some deficiencies exist . when focussing on the a=134 to a=140 area , which just has become within experimental reach /cite[klk",
    ": she ] , the rather pronounced odd - even deviations seem to indicate an earlier onset of collectivity in very neutron - rich @xmath13sn to @xmath65te isotopes than commonly predicted .",
    "this would result in slightly higher s@xmath19 values in this region , thus shifting the r - process path further away from stability involving progenitor isotopes with shorter t@xmath23 .    finally to the question ,",
    "why to present the _ initial progenitor abundances _ in the left part of fig .",
    "[ klk4 ] , which are no direct  observables  ?",
    "the reason is that in several recent papers discussing nucleosynthesis in the high - entropy bubble scenario of a sn  ii , charged - current neutrino reactions are predicted to significantly substitute for @xmath11-decays .",
    "this would require an extension from the classical @xmath11-flow equilibrium to a  weak - flow  equilibrium ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "also in this context , it was stated that a weak steady - flow equilibrium at n=82 can not be attained , which again would exclude @xmath4ag and @xmath14cd from this equilibrium .",
    "qian et al .",
    "@xcite argue that such neutrino - processing of the initial r - abundances during freeze - out might help shorten the time - scale for the r - process and could be responsible for the  filling - up  of the low - mass wings of the a@xmath6130 and a@xmath6195 n@xmath8 peaks .",
    "however , in this paper effects from @xmath11dn - emission during decay back to stability have been ignored completely . based on our results shown in fig .",
    "[ klk4 ] , where the left part corresponds to the _  unprocessed distribution  _ of fig .  2 in @xcite ,",
    "we come to different conclusions . already without considering additional abundance changes from capture of remaining seed neutrons and re - capture of delayed neutrons during freeze - out",
    ", we estimate that neutrino postprocessing effects are about an order of magnitude smaller than postulated by qian et al .",
    "our calculations suggest that the main effect of  filling - up  the initial under - abundances in the a=124126 region ( see left part of fig .",
    "[ klk4 ] ) is due to @xmath11dn - branching during the first 150 ms of the freeze - out rather than neutrino - induced neutron spallation .",
    "in this short review , i have tried to summarize our progress in studying nuclear properties of very neutron - rich isotopes that may be of importance in r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "although it has been a long and painstaking way over more than 15 years , there are still many open experimental and theoretical questions , among them also just the point discussed above about the astrophysical relevance of our data .",
    "if a careful evaluation of detailed network calculations would come to the conclusion that the nuclear - physics properties of the  classical  n=82 waiting - point nuclei at the top of the a@xmath6130 peak were , indeed , unimportant , we would accept it ",
    "most reluctantly . however , as long as this is not proven , we will endorse with claus rolf s recent affirmationion at cgs-10 : _  we will measure ( it ) anyhow ... !_.",
