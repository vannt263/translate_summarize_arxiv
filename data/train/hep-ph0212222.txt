    "the long sought - after signal from experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay has finally been reported by the heidelberg - moscow ( hm ) collaboration @xcite . in its most natural explanation",
    "the hm events suggest neutrinos to be fundamentally neutral particles in the sense of majorana @xcite .",
    "it is our intention to argue that the discovery a majorana particle , taken to its logical implications , opens a new era in the structure of spacetime .",
    "it constitutes a discovery in which spacetime is not merely a classical object , a mere @xmath0 realization of the lorentz algebra ( in the sense of ryder @xcite ) , but the underlying representation spaces exploit additional relative phases .",
    "these phases between the two @xmath1 building blocks encode in them important c , p , and t properties .",
    "furthermore , majorana particles belong to a new and unusual wigner class  a class necessary for implementing supersymmetry .",
    "even though neutrino itself may not be a supersymmetric particle , its majorana nature tells us that spacetime does realize a construct that is central to construction of supersymmetric theories .",
    "the lorentz algebra , associated with the generators of rotation , @xmath2 , and boosts , @xmath3 , fails to incorporate fermionic fields .",
    "as is well known , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , this circumstance is remedied by the introduction of two @xmath1 generators : & & su(2)_r:= ( + i ) , + & & su(2)_l:= ( - i ) . the resulting algebra is no longer that of the lorentz group . in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the weyl spinors belong to @xmath4 and @xmath5 representation spaces ; and the parity covariant spin-@xmath6 constructs belong to the @xmath7 representation space .",
    "the vector indexed objects , such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , transform as @xmath10 , and so on . therefore , while the lorentz algebra has served us well , the underlying representation spaces for the quantum field theoretic description of nature belong , at least in the non - planckian realm , to the two @xmath1 s introduced above . in reference",
    "@xcite we have taken an _ ab intio _ look at the representation spaces which are appropriate to the description of spin @xmath6 charged particles , vector particles , and rarita - schwinger particles . here , we present an _ ab initio _ formalism that embodies the original spirit of majorana but extends / completes it in a non - trivial way . in doing",
    "so we build upon , but do not confine , to already existing original literature @xcite and exploit our experience in the spacetime structure of massive particles to benefit us @xcite .    based upon our studies in refs .",
    "@xcite we take as given that wave equation for spinors underlying the description of spin one half charged particles carries a symmetry under the operation of @xmath7-representation - space charge conjugation operator : = (    cc 0_2 & i + -i & 0_2    ) k.[cc ] here , operator @xmath11 complex conjugates any object that appears on its right , and @xmath12 is the wigner s spin-@xmath6 time reversal operator . we refrain from identifying @xmath12 with `` @xmath13 , '' as is done implicitly in all considerations on the subject  see , e.g. , ref . @xcite",
    "because such an identification does not exist for higher - spin @xmath14 representation spaces .",
    "the existence of wigner time reversal operator for all @xmath15 , allows , for fermionic @xmath15 s , the introduction of @xmath16 neutral particles . ]",
    "= (    cc 0 & -1 + 1 & 0    ) .[wt ] we further assume that the @xmath17 operator , and related @xmath18 , and @xmath19 operators , are intrinsic to the @xmath7 representation space up to certain phases which may be fixed by additional physical requirements",
    ". the mentioned phases may affect commutative and anticommutative properties of the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 as these properties depend not only on the form of the operators but also on these phases and the spinors on which the operators act upon .",
    "the operator @xmath17 appeared on the physics scene not in expectation but as a surprise that lay hidden in spacetime symmetries and it revealed itself in the now famous dirac construct for spin one half . the well - known symmetry associated with this operator brought into existence prediction of an entirely new type matter , called antimatter . yet",
    ", the particles associated with matter , and those associated with antimatter , are not eigenstates of this very operator .",
    "instead , this operator takes particle spinors into antiparticle spinors and vice versa .",
    "the notion readily extends to a fully quantum field theoretic framework .",
    "beyond dirac , stckelberg in 1942 and feynman in 1948 proposed to interpret antiparticles as particles scattered backward in time @xcite .",
    "this latter proposal , as noted by hatfield @xcite , carries the advantage that it applies equally well to fermions as to bosons . however , already in 1937 majorana identified particle creation operators with antiparticle creation operators . in that",
    "quantum - field - theoretic proposal , majorana did not consistently alter the relevant representation space since he still used dirac s @xmath20 and @xmath21 spinors . moreover , given the time sequence of ideas , he could not foresee the impact of stckelberg - feynman interpretation for his proposal . the former deficiency was remedied , though only partly , by 1957 papers of mclennan and case @xcite , and by the 1996 work of ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we hope to attend to all these question , and in the process bring to attention additional structure in the theory of neutral particles .    at this stage of the _ paper _ it is , therefore , to be concluded that as far as neutral particles are concerned the existing state of theory is unsatisfactory .",
    "it calls for an _ ab initio _ construction based on the eigenspinors of the @xmath17 operator . after the reader has examined our presentation , it is our contention that she / he will find it absurd , though `` workable , '' to describe charged particles in terms of the neutral - particle framework we present .",
    "we carry the same sentiments for the existing description of neutral particles ( for it carries a strong dependence on charged - particle framework ) .",
    "charged and neutral particles demand their own independent frameworks .",
    "once that is done one may , if one wishes , seek differences and similarities between the two .",
    "but , not before . this _ paper",
    "_ undertakes this task .",
    ".the diagonal wigner blocks are the ordinary fermionic matter and bosonic gauge fields , while the off - diagonal blocks refer to new structure in spacetime ( refer to text for details ) .",
    "this primitive block can be extended to incorporate higher - spin particles of supergravity . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    following the same procedure as above , and using ( ) = , we obtain , instead : ( ) = 0 ; [ eqnn ] where =(    cc 0_2 & a + a^-1 & 0_2    ) .[eqn ] however , @xmath22 commutes with @xmath23 = 0 . therefore , eq .

    "( [ eqnb ] ) shows that each of the four components of the @xmath24 satisfies the klein - gordon equation : @xmath26 \\lambda(\\p ) = 0 .",
    "$ ] however , the latter equation should not be considered the wave equation for the @xmath24 .",
    "the correct equation is ( [ eqnb ] ) , and it is this equation when transformed to the configuration space which shall yield the full time evolution .",
    "the plane waves for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 ( depending upon whether the propagation is forward in time , or backward in time ) . to determine @xmath32",
    ", it suffices to study the wave equations in the rest frame of the particles . in that frame",
    ", the @xmath27 satisfies the following ( simplified)differential equation : .",
    "then , we exploited the fact that in configuration space , @xmath33 . when it acts upon @xmath34 the resulting eigenvalue vanishes ( so we dropped this term ) , and that @xmath35 . ]",

    "this equation does not fix the sign of @xmath32 .",

    "that is , majorana spinors are insensitive to the _ forward _ and _ backward _ directions in time so important in the feynman - stckelberg interpretation of particles and antiparticles .",
    "conventional _ distinction between particles and antiparticles disappears .",
    "in the dirac theory of charged particles , the _ positive_-definite norms of the @xmath39 spinors and _ negative_-definite norms of the @xmath40 spinors _ and _ the anticommutativity of the annihilation and creation operators plays a fundamental role in securing a theory with energy bounded from below . the dirac - particle dual , @xmath41 to a @xmath7 spinor , @xmath42 ,",

    "it yields real - definite norm for the spinors inhabiting the basis spinors of the dirac s @xmath7 representation space , and it implies the stated spinorial properties .    in order to quantize the theory with neutral particle spinors we find it necessary ( as has been verified through a detailed calculation ) to define _ neutral - particle duals _ @xmath43 : & & ^s _ ( ) = + ^a_(),^s _ ( ) = + ^a _ ( ) , + & & ^a _ ( ) = - ^s_(),^a _ ( ) = - ^s _ ( ) .",
