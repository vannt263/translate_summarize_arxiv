    "there is continuing evidence that the first doppler peak in the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is located at multipole number @xmath0 200 .",
    "this suggests that the universe is flat ( or , at least , nearly flat ) consistent with the predictions of standard inflationary theories that @xmath1 = 1 ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 , hanany et al .",
    "moreover , the results of recent intermediate redshift supernova type ia ( snia ) surveys indicate that the cosmological constant is non - zero ( riess et al .",
    "1998 , perlmutter et al . 1999 ) . taken together",
    ", the above results indicate that ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the present matter density parameter and @xmath4 is the density parameter corresponding to the cosmological constant @xmath5 .",
    "the interpretations given above of the observational results are , of course , a matter of debate : if recombination is delayed due to , e.g. , sources of ly@xmath6 resonance radiation , such as stars or active galactic nuclei ( peebles et al . 2000 ) , or slow decay of dark matter ( doroshkevich & naselsky 2000 , naselsky et al .",
    "2001 ) the observed position of the first doppler peak may actually indicate that the universe is open ( peebles et al .",
    "furthermore , snia may not be standard candles and effects of dust absorption ( like a redshift dependent extinction law ) may not have been properly accounted for ( s. toft , private communication ) .",
    "these complications could affect the determinations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 from the cmb and snia results .",
    "clearly , completely independent ways of determining @xmath3 and @xmath4 are highly desirable .",
    "one such way is to observationally determine the mass function of galaxy clusters at present as well as at redshifts up to @xmath7 :",
    "the observed present - day abundance of clusters places a strong constraint on cosmology : @xmath8 0.5 , where @xmath9 is the _ rms _ mass fluctuations on 8 @xmath10 mpc scale - see , e.g. , eke et al .",
    "1996 ( @xmath11 is the present hubble parameter in units of 100 km / s / mpc ; the above constraint also depends weakly on @xmath4 ) .",
    "this constraint is degenerate in @xmath3 and @xmath9 , but the degeneracy can be broken by studying the evolution of cluster abundance with redshift , especially for massive clusters - see , e.g. , borgani & guzzo ( 2001 ) and references therein . to illustrate this in a qualitative way we show in figures 1 and 2 the appearance on the sky of clusters at redshifts @xmath12 in a ( almost ) randomly selected 2.9x2.9 deg@xmath13 pencil beam for a scdm and a @xmath5cdm cosmology ( with ( @xmath14 ) = ( 1.0,0.0,0.5,0.53 ) and ( 0.3,0.7,0.65,1.0 ) respectively ) .",
    "the pencil beam was selected from n - body simulations , which are effectively @xmath15 particle , `` hubble volume '' simulations .",
    "all clusters with mass @xmath16 m@xmath17 are shown by filled circles with radius equal to the apparent virial radius and grey - scale coding such that brightness increases with redshift .",
    "the difference between the two figures is striking , and for the @xmath5cdm cosmology the cluster sky covering fraction appears to be @xmath18 30% out to a redshift of 1.4 and hence even larger than the otherwise impressive @xmath19% for the damped ly@xmath6 systems to redshifts of 4 - 5 ( one might argue , though , that for detection in x - rays or optical / nir it would be reasonable to use @xmath20 , rather than the virial radius - this would reduce the cluster sky covering fraction by almost a factor of 4 for the @xmath5cdm model ) .",
    "the determination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 using clusters requires fairly large cluster surveys ideally out to redshifts of @xmath211.5 - 2 - see below .",
    "the copenhagen cluster group is involved in three such surveys : 1 ) the eso imaging survey ( eis ) , which is an optical / nir survey covering , when completed , 15 deg@xmath13 , 2 ) the xmm - newton large scale survey ( xmm - lss ) , which is an x - ray survey covering , when completed , 64 deg@xmath13 , and finally 3 ) the planck thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( tsz ) all sky cluster survey ( more information about the surveys etc .",
    "is available at our web site http://www.astro.ku.dk/xcosmos ) .      to qualitatively illustrate the potential difficulties in optical / nir cluster searches we made the following little experiment",
    ": at the position of each of the @xmath22 dark matter particles in the pencil beams shown in figures 1 and 2 we randomly drew from an appropriately normalized , passively evolving field galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "if the apparent magnitude of the `` galaxy '' drawn was between 12 and 24 ( the approximate magnitude limits of the eis survey ) a point was plotted in figure 3 ( scdm : left panel , @xmath5cdm : right panel ) .",
    "it is clearly difficult to spot the 247 and 1016 clusters shown in figures 1 and 2 !    in reality the observational situation is better than it seems , mainly because the cluster lf is significantly `` brighter '' than that of the field : the so - called matched filter technique ( postman et al . 1996 ) as implemented by the eis team ( olsen et al .",
    "1999 ) is routinely used to detect clusters up to @xmath23 , with tentative analysis of followup observations strongly supporting a cluster at @xmath24 ( l. olsen , private communication ) .      turning to x - ray detection of clusters we show in figure 4 the expected number of clusters per redshift bin ( 0.1 in @xmath25 ) in the 64 deg@xmath13 xmm - lss field brighter than the nominal flux detection limit of xmm .",
    "the figure is based on n - body simulations of a range of cosmologies , the conventional temperature  mass ( @xmath26 ) relation and a non - evolving ( present - day ) luminosity  temperature ( @xmath27 ) relation .",
    "it is clear from the figure how one can distinguish between @xmath5 ( flat , with low @xmath3 ) , open and @xmath28 cosmologies from observations in the range 0.3@xmath290.8 and how one can furthermore determine the actual value of @xmath3 by adding observations in the range 1@xmath302 .",
    "though the theoretical predictions obviously depends on the above assumptions , one should note that the dependence of the @xmath27 and @xmath26 relations on redshift will be observationally well constrained in the future .",
    "clusters have been detected in x - rays up to a current record redshift of @xmath31 ( fabian et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "when cmb photons pass through the hot gas in a galaxy cluster they inverse compton scatter off hot electrons in the gas shifting the cmb spectrum to slightly larger energies .",
    "this causes a cmb temperature _ decrease _ in the low frequency ( rayleigh - jeans ) part of the cmb spectrum of @xmath32 , where @xmath33=2.73 k and @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 the thomson cross section , @xmath37 the electron number density , @xmath38 the electron temperature and the integral is along the line - of - sight .",
    "cluster detection through the tsz effect offers two great advantages over x - ray detection : a ) the tsz properties of clusters are differently sensitive to the structure of the intracluster medium than their x - ray properties because the local contribution to the tsz effect is proportional to the pressure ( eq .",
    "1 ) whereas the local x - ray emissivity is proportional to the square of the density times the square root of the temperature ( to first order ) .",
    "the tsz effect is thus less centrally concentrated than the x - ray emission and much less sensitive to small - scale gas clumping .",
    "moreover , the tsz `` luminosity '' is proportional to the total thermal energy content of the cluster gas ( eq .",
    "1 ) which should correlate fairly tightly with the total baryon content of the cluster and hence its total mass .",
    "so the `` @xmath39 '' relation would be expected to be significantly tighter than the @xmath40 relation .",
    "b ) the tsz `` surface brightness '' of a cluster is independent of its distance whereas its x - ray ( and optical / nir ) surface brightness drops as @xmath41 , so that very distant clusters are comparatively easier to detect through the tsz effect .",
    "the planck survey will be all sky ( except for excluded regions near the galactic plane ) and should detect @xmath42 clusters at @xmath43 , @xmath44 clusters at @xmath45 and @xmath46 clusters at @xmath47 , depending on the cosmology , of course - the numbers given are for a ( @xmath2 universe .",
    "we finally note that combination of tsz and x - ray data offers a powerful probe of the gas structure in clusters and in some circumstances may allow a direct determination of their individual distances and hence the hubble parameter ( silk & white 1978 ) .",
    "jsl is grateful to f.  matteucci and the other organizers of this conference for giving him the opportunity to participate and contribute .",
    "we have benefited from discussions with stefano borgani , lisbeth fogh olsen , laura portinari and sune toft ."
