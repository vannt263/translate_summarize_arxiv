    "graph theory and matroid theory are mutually enriching . as reported in  @xcite ,",
    "w. tutte famously observed that , `` if a theorem about graphs can be expressed in terms of edges and circuits alone it probably exemplifies a more general theorem about matroids '' . in  @xcite we proposed that a similar claim holds true for topological graph theory and delta - matroid theory , namely that , `` if a theorem about embedded graphs can be expressed in terms of its spanning quasi - trees then it probably exemplifies a more general theorem about delta - matroids '' . in that paper we provided evidence for this claim by showing that , just as with graph and matroid theory , many fundamental definitions and results in topological graph theory and delta - matroid theory are compatible with each other ( in the sense that they canonically translate from one setting to the other ) .",
    "a significant consequence of this connection is that the geometric ideas of topological graph theory provide insight and intuition into the structure of delta - matroids , thus pushing forward the development of both areas . here",
    "we provide further support for our claim above by presenting results on delta - matroids that are inspired by recent research on ribbon graphs .",
    "we are principally concerned with duality , which for delta - matroids is a much richer and more varied notion than for matroids .",
    "the concepts of duality for plane and planar graphs , and for graphic matroids are intimately connected : the dual of the matroid of an embedded graph corresponds to the matroid of the dual graph ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) if and only the graph is plane .",
    "moreover , the dual of the matroid of a graph is graphic if and only if the graph is planar .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend these fundamental graph duality  matroid duality relationships from graphs in the plane to graphs embedded on higher genus surfaces . to achieve",
    "this requires us to move from matroids to the more general setting of delta - matroids .",
    "moving beyond plane and planar graphs opens the door to the various notions of the `` dual '' of an embedded graph that appear in the topological graph theory literature .",
    "here we consider the examples of petrie duals and direct derivatives  @xcite , partial duals  @xcite and twisted duals  @xcite .",
    "we will see that these duals are compatible with existing constructions in delta - matroid theory , including twists  @xcite , and loop complementation  @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of the geometrical insights provided by topological graph theory to deduce and prove new structural results on delta - matroids and on their polynomial invariants . throughout the paper we emphasise the interaction and compatibility between delta - matroid theory and topological graph theory .",
    "much of the very recent work on delta - matroids appears in a series of papers by r.  brijder and h.  hoogeboom  @xcite , who were originally motivated by an application to gene assembly in one - cell organisms known as cilliates .",
    "their study of the effect of the principal pivot transform on symmetric binary matrices led them to the study of binary delta - matroids . as we will see the fundamental connections made possible by the abstraction to delta - matroids",
    "allows us to view notions of duality in the setting of symmetric binary matrices and the apparently unconnected setting of ribbon graphs as exactly the same thing .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin by reviewing delta - matroids , embedded graphs and their various types of duality , and the connection between delta - matroids and embedded graphs . in section  [ 3rd ]",
    "we use the geometric perspectives offered by topological graph theory to present a rough structure theorem for the class of delta - matroids that are twists of matroids .",
    "we give some applications to eulerian matroids , extending a result of d.  welsh  @xcite . in section  [ 4th ]",
    ", we show that petrie duality can be qualified as the analogue of a more general delta - matroid operation , namely loop complementation .",
    "we show that a group action on delta - matroids due to r.  brijder , h.  hoogeboom  @xcite is the analogue of twisted duality from j.  ellis - monaghan and i.  moffatt  @xcite .",
    "we apply the insights provided by this connection to give a number of structural results about delta - matroids . in section  [ 5th ]",
    "we apply our results to graph and matroid polynomials .",
    "we show that the penrose polynomial and transition polynomial  @xcite are delta - matroidal , in the sense that they are determined ( up to a simple pre - factor ) by the delta - matroid of the underlying ribbon graph , and are compatible with r.  brijder , h.  hoogeboom s penrose and transition polynomials of  @xcite .",
    "we relate the bollobs  riordan and penrose polynomials to the transition polynomial and find recursive definitions of these polynomials .",
    "finally , we give a surprising expression for the penrose polynomial of a vf - safe delta - matroid in terms of the characteristic polynomial : @xmath1 .    throughout the paper we emphasise the interaction and compatibility between delta - matroids and ribbon graphs .",
    "we provide evidence that this new perspective offered by topological graph theory enables significant advances to be made in the theory of delta - matroids .",
