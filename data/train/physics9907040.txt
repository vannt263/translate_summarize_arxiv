    "dealing with high - order resonances with a view to optimizating stability is not so straightforward as in the linear case : the number of resonances that can be excited both by a given multipole and by the set of correctors meant for compensating a given resonance becomes higer and higher ; moreover the resonance compensation is only one of the tools that has to be used to get a succesfully optics optimization .",
    "+ for these reasons we have not here attempted a general comparison between the summed and the single resonance compensations using tracking analysis .",
    "we intend to return to this question in the future .",
    "+ we note however that a certain number of attempts to compensate one particular sextupolar resonance for the henon map show that the two compensations are not far only if the working point is close enough to the considered resonance .",
    "the summed resonance compensation is to in general better in the case of the compensation of several resonances at the same time .",
    "a general method has been derived for the summation of all the resonances within a given family both for the linear and for the non - linear cases .",
    "the fact that this summation is valid and gives a meaningful result is confirmed by its application to the known closed - orbit distortion equation , the betatron modulation equation and the decoupling of the linear transfer matrix for a ring .",
    "the application of the summed - resonance driving term to the coupling raises the question of the relative merits of the different types of coupling compensation that are now possible .",
    "this problem has been investigated with the help of the henon map .",
    "the results indicate that use of the summed - resonance compensation ( equivalent to the matrix approach ) yields a larger dynamics aperture .",

    "<S> analyses of betatron coupling can be broadly divided into two categories : the matrix approach that decouples the single - turn matrix to reveal the normal modes and the hamiltonian approach that evaluates the coupling in terms of the action of resonances in perturbation theory . the latter is often regarded as being less exact but good for physical insight . </S>",
    "<S> the common opinion is that the correction of the two closest sum and difference resonances to the working point is sufficient to reduce the off - axis terms in the @xmath0 single - turn matrix , but this is only partially true . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is explained , and a method is developed that sums to infinity all coupling resonances and , in this way , obtains results equivalent to the matrix approach . </S>",
    "<S> the two approaches is discussed with reference to the dynamic aperture . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the extension of the summation method to resonances of all orders is outlined and the relative importance of a single resonance compared to all resonances of a given order is analytically described as a function of the working point .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the difference between the summed and the single resonance compensations is noticeable : the compensation of the all families relative to the coupling resonances allows an improvement close to 10% respect to the case in which the high frequency part of the perturbative hamiltonian is neglected . </S>",
    "<S> + it can also be pointed out that the summed compensation seems to slightly improve ( at the limit of sensitivity due to errors ) the dynamic aperture respect to the uncoupled case . </S>"
