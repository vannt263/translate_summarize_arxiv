    "solvable lattice models related to the lie superalgebras @xcite have attracted a great deal of attention @xcite .",
    "for example , the supersymmetric @xmath3 model in strongly correlated electron system has received much attentions in relation with the high @xmath4 superconductivity .",
    "these models have both fermionic and bosonic degree of freedom , and are given as solutions of the graded yang - baxter equations @xcite . to solve such models , the bethe ansatz is widely used in many literatures ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . however , many of them deal only with models related to simple representations like fundamental ones ; there was few _ systematic _",
    "study by the bethe ansatz on more complicated models such as fusion models @xcite .    in view of such situations ,",
    "we have recently carried out @xcite _ systematically _ an analytic bethe ansatz @xcite related to the lie superalgebras @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "namely , we have proposed a class of dressed vacuum forms ( dvfs ) labeled by young ( super ) diagrams and a set of fusion relations ( @xmath1-system ) among them . besides the eigenvalue formulae of the transfer matrices ,",
    "the thermodynamics have also been discussed by several people .",
    "particularly , the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) @xcite equation was proposed for the supersymmetric @xmath3 model @xcite , which is related to @xmath7 , and the supersymmetric extended hubbard model @xcite , which is related to @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , there is a paper @xcite on the excited state tba equation for these two important models of 1d highly correlated electron systems from the point of view of the quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) method .",
    "in addition , the tba equation for @xmath9 model was presented @xcite in relation with the continuum limit of the integrable super spin chains .",
    "however , the thermodynamics of the quantum spin model related to the orthosymplectic lie superalgebra @xmath10 is not so understood as @xmath9 case .",
    "in particular , as far as we know , there have been no literatures on the tba equation even for the simplest orthosymplectic @xmath0 integrable spin chain @xcite .",
    "this is regrettable because this model may be related to interesting topics such as @xmath11 superconformal - symmetry in field theory , and the loop model , which will describe statistical properties of polymers in condensed matter physics @xcite . in view of these situation",
    ", we have recently proposed the tba equation for the @xmath0 integrable spin chain @xcite by using the string hypothesis @xcite .    though we expect that the resultant tba equation describes the free energy correctly , there exists the deviation from the string hypothesis @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to evaluate other physical quantities such as correlation length . as an alternative method which overcomes such difficulties , the qtm method has been proposed @xcite .",
    "now we shall briefly sketch the qtm method . utilizing the general equivalence theorem @xcite ,",
    "one transforms the 1d quantum system into the 2d classical counterpart and defines the qtm on such a fictitious system of size @xmath12 ( referred to as the trotter number , which should be taken @xmath13 ) . since the qtm has a finite gap , the original problem for the calculation of the partition function reduces to finding the single largest eigenvalue of the qtm . to evaluate it actually ,",
    "we utilize the underlying integrable structure , which admits introduction of the  commuting \" qtm with a complex parameter @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we introduce some auxiliary functions including the qtm itself , which satisfy functional relations .",
    "we select these auxiliary functions such that they are _",
    "a_nalytic , _",
    "n_on_z_ero and have _ c_onstant asymptotics in appropriate strips on the complex @xmath14-plane ( we call this property anzc ) .",
    "thus we can transform the functional relations into the non - linear integral equations ( nlie ) which describe the free energy . in these nlie",
    ", we can take the trotter limit @xmath13 . adopting a subset of fusion hierarchy as auxiliary functions",
    ", we find that these nlie are equivalent to the tba equation based on the string hypothesis @xcite .",
    "in general , a set of fusion hierarchy satisfies the functional relations called @xmath1-system , and this @xmath1-system is transformed to the @xmath2-system . and @xmath2-system are given in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "] by selecting them so that they have anzc property in appropriate strips , one derives the nlie which will be identical to the tba equation .",
    "furthermore , considering the sub - leading eigenvalues of the qtm , we can derive systematically the  excited state \" tba equations which provide the correlation length at any finite temperatures .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to apply our recent results @xcite to the @xmath0 integrable spin chain , and to construct the tba equation and it s excited state version from the point of view of the above - mentioned qtm method .",
    "we have also confirmed the fact that our tba equation coincides with the one @xcite from the string hypothesis .",
    "we believe that this paper yields a basis of future studies of the thermodynamics by the qtm method for more general models such as the @xmath10 model .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate the @xmath0 integrable spin chain at finite temperatures in terms of the commuting qtm . in section 3 , to evaluate its eigenvalue , we utilize the fusion hierarchy of the qtm",
    ". it is given as a set of the dressed vacuum forms ( dvfs ) which is a summation over tableaux labeled by a young ( super ) diagram with one column .",
    "these dvfs and their certain combinations ( @xmath2-functions ) satisfy the @xmath1-system and the @xmath2-system , respectively . the formulation of the dvfs and the functional relations are essentially independent of the vacuum part .",
    "thus we can utilize the results in ref .",
    "@xcite only by replacing the vacuum parts of the dvfs defined in ref .",
    "@xcite with those of the qtm . based on the analytical property of the dvfs and the @xmath2-functions , in section 4",
    "we derive the non - linear integral equations for the free energy , and in section 5 for the correlation length .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the summary and the discussion .",
    "in this section , we introduce the quantum spin chain related to the lie superalgebra @xmath0 and formulate the commuting qtm for this model .",
    "the classical counterpart of this model is given by the @xmath15-matrix ( see for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath16 which is a rational solution of the graded yang - baxter equation @xcite associated with the three dimensional representation of the lie superalgebra @xmath0 ( to be precise ,  super yangian \" @xmath17 ) , whose basis is @xmath18-graded and labeled by the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 denotes the graded permutation operator which has @xmath22 matrix elements @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a @xmath22 matrix whose matrix elements are @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a @xmath27 matrix @xmath28 and @xmath29 with the total order @xmath30 .",

    "note that @xmath38 is the ( non - graded ) permutation operator .",

    "thus the free energy per site @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 however , in the antiferromagnetic case @xmath43 , the eigenvalues of @xmath63 will be infinitely degenerate in the limit @xmath64 . therefore taking the trace in above expression ( [ free1 ] )",
    "is a serious problem . to avoid this difficulty",
    ", we transform the term @xmath63 as follows : @xmath65 now we introduce the qtm , which plays the fundamental role to describe the thermal quantities @xmath66 due to the yang - baxter equation , we see that the qtm is commutative : @xmath67=0.\\ ] ] hereafter we write the @xmath51-th largest eigenvalue of the qtm @xmath68 as @xmath69 .",
