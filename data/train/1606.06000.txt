    "non - hermitian random matrices largely began with the pioneering work of ginibre in 1965 @xcite , which discussed three ensembles of matrices having independent real , complex and real quaternion , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 obeys the quaternionic multiplication and addition rules .",
    "these real quaternions can be represented as @xmath0 complex matrices and it is in this representation that we calculate the ( complex ) eigenvalues of real quaternionic matrices .",
    "we provide an overview of quaternionic definitions and properties in appendix [ app : quatpf ] . ] random entries respectively , in keeping with dyson s three - fold way @xcite . as with hermitian ensembles , these non - hermitian ensembles correspond to the indices @xmath16 respectively , which represent the number of independent real components in each matrix entry .    more recently , various other non - hermitian ensembles have attracted interest ( see @xcite for a small selection ) .",
    "one particular categorization relevant to the present work is the ` geometrical triumvirate ' of ensembles described in @xcite , which identifies random matrix ensembles with the three classical surfaces of constant curvature : the plane , the sphere and the pseudo- or anti - sphere .",
    "we leave the interested reader to investigate for themselves all the details contained in those works ; here we highlight only the spherical ensemble , which is given by the matrix ` ratio ' @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are independent @xmath20 gaussian matrices ( _ i.e. _ , they are drawn from the ginibre ensembles , which correspond to the plane ) , and @xmath18 is non - singular . by analogy with cauchy random variables ( which can be described as the ratio of two gaussian random variables )",
    "these matrices have been called _ cauchy matrices _",
    "@xcite , and have the matrix cauchy distribution function @xcite @xmath21 where the ` dagger ' should be interpreted as ` transpose ' , ` hermitian conjugate ' or ` quaternion dual ' for @xmath22 ( real matrices ) , @xmath23 ( complex matrices ) and @xmath24 ( real quaternion matrices ) respectively .",
    "note that for @xmath13 , the determinant is to be understood as a quaternion determinant ( see appendix [ app : quatpf ] ) .",
    "we note also that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath25 defined in are equal to the _ generalized eigenvalues _ of the pair @xmath26 , given as the solutions @xmath27 to the equation @xmath28 which is the viewpoint of @xcite .    as in the case of the ginibre ensembles , the eigenvalue density has distinctive symmetries depending on the value of @xmath29 :    *",
    "@xmath12 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 complex ) : rotational symmetry in the complex plane ; * @xmath11 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 real ) : positive density of eigenvalues along the real axis , with reflective symmetry across the real axis ; * @xmath13 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 real quaternion ) : depletion of eigenvalues near the real axis , with reflective symmetry across the real axis .    ( the reflective symmetry is a property of all finite - size real and real quaternion matrices , where the non - real eigenvalues come in complex - conjugate pairs . ) the reason for the name ` spherical ensemble ' is that the eigenvalues of @xmath25 have uniform distribution ( under stereographic projection ) on the unit sphere in the limit of large matrix dimension , which is a consequence of the _ spherical law _",
    "@xcite , a result analogous to the more famous _",
    "circular law _ for ginibre matrices ( see for example @xcite ) . for details concerning the eigenvalue statistics of these ensembles",
    "the interested reader may refer to @xcite , in addition to the works listed above .",
    "one may also seek a physical interpretation of these processes in terms of minimizing some energy function on a sphere , in which case we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "each class in the geometrical triumvirate can be generalized by the introduction of parameters whose effect is to restrict the eigenvalue density to an annulus in the complex plane through a procedure called ` inducing ' ( we provide a brief overview of this procedure in appendix [ s : genrand ] , but comprehensive descriptions are given in @xcite ) .",
    "however , we take as our definition of the _ induced spherical ensemble _",
    "those @xmath20 matrices @xmath30 that are defined by the matrix probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; as mentioned above the parameter @xmath29 corresponds to matrices with real ( @xmath11 ) , complex ( @xmath12 ) or real quaternion ( @xmath13 ) entries .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 the ensemble corresponding to @xmath36 was the subject of @xcite , while that corresponding to @xmath37 was discussed in @xcite ; the aim of the work in this paper is to study the eigenvalue statistics of the analogous @xmath13 real quaternion ensemble .",
    "first note that with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , ( [ d : sphmats ] ) reduces to ( [ e : sphmpdf ] ) and we are back in the regime of the spherical law , which was mentioned above .",
    "the result of the generalization ( [ d : sphmats ] ) is to keep the eigenvalues away from the origin and @xmath5 , effectively squeezing the support into an annulus .",
    "this annulus projects ( stereographically ) to a belt of eigenvalues centered on the great circle corresponding to the circle @xmath40 . as an aid to visualization in figures [ f : quatbb][f : quatss ] of section [ s : slims ] we present simulated eigenvalue plots for @xmath41 and their stereographic projections onto the unit sphere . in brief , as in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 cases we find four regimes that correspond to large and small values ( compared to @xmath8 ) of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "although we take the pdf to be our definition of the induced spherical matrices , as alluded to above , it is possible to explicitly construct them from products of wishart and ginibre matrices .",
    "while the real quaternion construction is a natural modification of the discussions in the above references , there are some subtleties related to numerical monte carlo simulations of the real quaternion induced spherical ensemble and so we make some comments on this point in appendix [ s : genrand ] .",
    "we note that these matrices are similar to the class of matrices that relate to the feinberg ",
    "zee _ single ring theorem _ , which was discussed in @xcite and rigorously proved in @xcite .",
    "the theorem states that for @xmath20 complex matrices @xmath42 from a distribution @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a polynomial with positive leading coefficient , the support of the eigenvalue density tends toward an annulus around the origin , and the density is rotationally symmetric . from the figures in section",
    "[ s : slims ] we see that the eigenvalue densities certainly have these properties , yet ( [ d : sphmats ] ) is a special case of ( [ e : fz ] ) only formally ( in the sense that we require @xmath45 to be a general analytic function ) .",
    "more work is needed to make this connection precise .",
    "the explicit goal of the present work is to calculate the eigenvalue correlation functions and various scaled limits of the eigenvalue density for the real quaternion matrices drawn from the distribution ( [ d : sphmats ] ) , which therefore generalizes the results in @xcite . as mentioned above , the complex analogue of this work",
    "was presented in @xcite while the real case can be found in @xcite . since quaternions , quaternion determinants and pfaffians",
    "play a crucial role in this work we provide a review in appendix [ app : quatpf ] .    to obtain our results",
    "we will make use of a _ generalized partition function _ , which , for a general joint probability density function ( jpdf ) @xmath46 in @xmath8 variables @xmath47 , is defined by the average @xmath48:=\\left \\langle \\prod_{j=1}^n v_j ( z_j ) \\right\\rangle_{\\mathcal{q } } = \\int_{\\omega } dz_{1 } \\ ; v_1 ( z_1 ) \\cdots \\int_{\\omega } dz_{n } \\ ; v_n ( z_n ) \\ : \\mathcal{q } ( { \\mathbf{z}}_n),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 are some well - behaved functions in the variables @xmath50 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that ( [ e : gpf ] ) can be written in a convenient pfaffian form for various eigenvalue jpdfs , of which the one considered in this work is an example .",
    "this allows us to follow @xcite and use ( [ e : gpf ] ) to calculate the eigenvalue correlation functions . for a general jpdf @xmath46 the _ @xmath9-point correlation function _",
    "is defined by @xmath51 } \\int_{\\omega } dz_{m+1 } \\cdots \\int_{\\omega } dz_n \\\\ & \\qquad\\times   \\mathcal{q } ( r_1 , \\dots , r_m , z_{m+1 } , \\dots , z_n),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of which the eigenvalue density is given by @xmath52 , with the normalization @xmath53 equivalently we can obtain the correlation functions via functional differentiation of the generalized partition function @xmath54 } \\frac{\\delta^{m } } { \\delta v_1 ( z_1 ) \\cdots \\delta v_m ( z_m ) } z_n [ { \\mathbf{v } } ] \\right|_{{\\mathbf{v}}={\\mathbf{1}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will find that for the jpdf we consider in this work , @xmath55 $ ] can be written as a fredholm pfaffian ( or quaternion determinant ) , which via ( [ e : correlnd ] ) yields the correlation functions immediately ( see section [ s : gpf ] ) .",
    "our method here falls into the category of ( skew-)orthogonal polynomial methods and , as such , we will have need of the polynomials corresponding to the generalized partition functions ( [ e : gpf ] ) .",
    "it is not yet known how to complete a calculation analogous to that in @xcite for @xmath22 , where the skew - orthogonal polynomials are deduced directly from an average over characteristic polynomials , however , a result from @xcite furnishes us with the necessary expressions .",
    "armed with these polynomials we establish the eigenvalue correlation functions in propositions [ p : correlns4 ] .",
    "from these correlation functions we find ( with @xmath56 ) that the eigenvalue density ( normalized according to ( [ e : edens ] ) ) is @xmath57    having established the correlation functions for finite matrix sizes @xmath8 , we then analyze various scaled limits of the eigenvalue density in section [ s : slims ] .",
    "as discussed above , it is known from the spherical law that for spherical matrices ( [ e : sphmpdf ] ) the eigenvalue density is uniform ( under stereographic projection ) on the unit sphere .",
    "the figures in section [ s : slims ] suggest the eigenvalue support is restricted to an annulus in the complex plane for large matrix size , the inner and outer radii of which depend on the relative sizes of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . indeed , as in @xcite",
    ", we can identify four regimes of interest as @xmath58 : ( i ) @xmath59 , @xmath60 ; ( ii ) @xmath59 , @xmath61 ; ( iii ) @xmath62 , @xmath60 ; and ( iv ) @xmath62 , @xmath61 . broadly speaking , for large @xmath6",
    "the eigenvalues are repulsed from the origin ( which corresponds to the south pole ) , and for large @xmath63 the eigenvalues are repulsed from infinity ( the north pole ) . while we find that we can calculate the limiting bulk and annular edge densities in these four regimes , we are not yet able to derive the density near the real line .",
    "we present a conjecture for this in section [ s : gencorrelns4 ] along with some simulated data to support the claim .",
    "further , we discuss a differential equation , which , if it was to be solved , should also yield the asymptotics for the full eigenvalue correlation function in this and similar ensembles  however , based upon the structure of the equation ( and similar difficulties in related studies , eg @xcite ) this appears a remote possibility .      to avoid confusion",
    "we state here some of the notation commonly used in this paper .",
    "we will usually use upper - case bold letters ( e.g. @xmath64 ) to denote matrices , often with an accompanying subscript to denote the matrix dimension .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath65 to refer to ` transpose ' , ` hermitian conjugate ' or ` quaternion dual ' for real , complex and real quaternion matrices , respectively ; occasionally , in order to be clear on the matrix type , we will use the superscripts @xmath66 and @xmath67 to denote them explicitly . a detailed description of the properties of the relevant quaternion properties is contained in appendix [ app : quatpf ] .    lower case bold letters are lists ( they need not be ordered ) , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath68 , where the subscript denotes the length .",
    "in particular , the bold @xmath69 will always denote the list of eigenvalues of a system of size @xmath70 .",
    "generally these eigenvalues will either be real or live in the upper half complex plane , that is @xmath71",
    ".    we will denote the wedge product of complex and real quaternion quantities respectively by @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "the wedge product of the differentials of the independent real entries of an object ( a matrix or list ) are then given by @xmath76 where the indices run over all values corresponding to independent elements .",
    "we make use of the ( half - max ) heaviside step function @xmath77",
    "the normalization in the complex case @xmath78 was presented in @xcite and the real case @xmath79 in @xcite ; by performing a similar procedure the normalization @xmath80 can also be calculated explicitly .",

    "the idea is to use a schur decomposition @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a symplectic matrix ( _ i.e. _ , a unitary real quaternion matrix ) and @xmath109 is a ( block ) upper triangular matrix , whose diagonal blocks correspond to the eigenvalues @xmath110 of @xmath30 .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , to find the eigenvalue correlation functions we will first find the generalized partition function ( [ e : gpf ] ) and then use the functional differentiation formula ( [ e : correlnd ] ) to obtain the correlation functions .",
    "we know from @xcite that pdfs of the form ( [ e : ejpdfq ] ) can be transformed to a more convenient pfaffian or quaternion determinant form using the method of integration over alternate variables via the vandermonde identity .",
    "we state only the results here ; the interested reader is referred to @xcite ( in addition to those references mentioned above ) for explicit details .",

    "as mentioned above , in previous studies on similar real quaternion ensembles @xcite the calculation of analogous asymptotic results has been accomplished by finding a differential equation for the double sum equivalent to that in ( [ e : dens4 ] ) ; solving this equation gives an expression for the double sum in terms of a single integral , which can then be analyzed asymptotically .",
    "this process relies on noting that the exponents of the variables are closely related to the factors appearing in the gamma functions , and so by taking derivatives one is able to reduce the size of the inner sum .",
    "a crucial part of this procedure is that a derivative with respect to ( say ) @xmath212 removes the terms proportional to @xmath213 from the sum .",
    "then , by performing some judicious re - summing , one finds a soluble differential equation .",
    "the problem we face here is that in order to obtain agreement between the exponent of @xmath212 and the gamma function factors , we must first multiply the sum through by @xmath214 , meaning that the first derivative with respect to @xmath212 will not kill off any terms in the sum , and so we obtain an equation containing iterated derivatives and anti - derivatives that has so far not been solved .",
    "denote the double sum as @xmath215 then we have the differential equations @xmath216 \\sigma ( z , w)\\\\ \\nonumber & = \\frac{2^{2l + 2n } } { \\pi } \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty } \\frac{(z w)^l } { \\gamma ( 2l + k + 1 ) \\gamma ( 2n -k + 1)}\\\\ \\label{e : dblsumde } & = - \\big [ w^{2n } a_w w^{-2n- 2l -1 } ( w a_w)^l d_w ( w^{-1 } d_w)^l w^{2l } + w \\big ] \\sigma ( z , w),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath217 and @xmath218 is the anti - derivative ( with constant term zero ) .",
    "a similar problem has also been encountered in studying products of quaternionic ginibre matrices , where equally intractable des were found ( * ? ? ? * ( 4.99 ) and ( 4.100 ) ) .",
    "one expects that the solution of the equation ( [ e : dblsumde ] ) will yield a ` nice ' integral expression for the eigenvalue correlation function kernel @xmath219 , then leading to asymptotic expressions for the full correlation function ( [ e : correlnsq ] ) in each of the four regimes of the parameters @xmath186 .",
    "however , a solution to des like seems remote , and so it seems that different techniques will be required for the analysis of @xmath24 ensembles , since the double sum is a common feature ( arising from the even skew - orthogonal polynomials ) .",
    "on the topic of universality results , we expect that the spherical law of @xcite can be generalized to the case here , a ` spherical annulus law ' @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the indicator function , and @xmath222 is the spherical annulus corresponding to the boundary circles in the complex plane with radii . we also suspect that the single - ring theorem of @xcite can be generalized to the case here , that is , the polynomial @xmath45 in can perhaps be broadened to include the logarithmic expressions we find in .",
    "another outstanding calculation is that of the average over the product of characteristic polynomials @xmath223 in . although the end result is known ( by substitution of the skew - orthogonal polynomials )",
    ", it would be desirable to have a derivation along the lines of ( * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we find the scaled limits of the density in the bulk ( away from the real line ) as well as near the inner and outer annular radii , in the four regimes corresponding to large or small values of @xmath7 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> after a stereographic projection the density is uniform on a spherical annulus , except for a depletion of eigenvalues on a great circle corresponding to the real axis ( as expected for a real quaternion ensemble ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also form a conjecture for the behaviour of the density near the real line based on analogous results in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 ensembles ; we support our conjecture with data from monte carlo simulations of a large number of matrices drawn from the @xmath13 induced spherical ensemble . </S>"
