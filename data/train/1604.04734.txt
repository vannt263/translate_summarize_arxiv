    "string theory is a promising framework for a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "its main idea concerns on the fact that the building blocks of nature are one - dimensional strings , instead of zero dimensional particles . due to inflation",
    ", these fundamental strings could have been stretched in the early universe and can exist today , at least hypothetically , as extended strings of cosmological sizes @xcite .",
    "a more traditional framework to describe particles and its interactions , the quantum theory of fields , also predicts that cosmic strings could have been formed in the early universe due to a phase transition @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "it is natural to study the cosmological and astrophysical effects generated by one - dimensional extended strings , as individual objects or also as a collective phenomena .",
    "a cloud of strings is the one - dimensional analogous of a cloud of dust .",
    "the theoretical framework for such objects has been developed by letelier in @xcite , and recently several works on the subject has appeared , e.g. , on its space - time structure @xcite , and thermodynamics properties @xcite . in the spirit of considering these strings as fundamental objects ,",
    "it is natural to consider them in a gravitational theory that goes beyond einstein s gravity , since the low - energy limit of string theory implies the natural generalization of general relativity to higher dimensions , namely , lovelock theory of gravity .    in this paper ,",
    "our interest is to study the perturbations around the classical space - time generated by the cloud of strings . to be more precise",
    ", we will study the scalar and tensor quasinormal modes for a cloud of strings inside a black hole .",
    "quasinormal modes are complex numbers that model the emission of gravitational waves by perturbed objects .",
    "its real part is related with the frequency of emission , and its imaginary part is related with how the oscillation decay in time ( for a review , see @xcite ) .    the study of quasinormal modes has received a great attention in the last years for two fundamental reasons : the first and most obvious one is related with the search for gravitational waves emitted by compact objects , such as black holes and neutron stars .",
    "the recent first direct detection of an emission , and the amazingly precise matching between the observed and theoretically calculated data , has crowned such efforts @xcite . as a secondary reason",
    ", we can mention the gauge / gravity dualities , where the quasinormal modes in the gravitational side of the correspondence is related with the poles of a propagator in the dual theory .",
    "being a mere theoretical framework for the study of strong coupled gauge theories , or a realistic description for a hypothetical holographic universe , the fact is that the gauge / gravity dualities has attained a great deal of attention over the last years .",
    "our main goal in this paper will be to study the quasinormal modes for a black hole , with a cloud of strings , in the 2nd order lovelock theory , also called einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "the limit to general relativity can be easily obtaining taking @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the parameter that takes care of the difference between general relativity and einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "the quasinormal modes for a black hole in einstein - gauss - bonnet has already been calculated in @xcite and @xcite , for scalar and tensor modes , respectively .",
    "now we add a cloud of strings to understand how the presence of this object can affect the frequency of emission and the rate of decay .",
    "also , we will be able to study how the introduction of the gauss - bonnet term will modify the spectra of emission generated by the cloud of strings , inside a black hole , as compared with the same system in general relativity .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner : in section 2 we will briefly discuss how to construct the lovelock model of gravity . in section 3 we will introduce the formalism for the cloud of strings , together with their space - time structure . in section 4",
    "we will calculate the scalar quasinormal modes for such a system and compare then with the same gravitational model , but without the cloud of strings , with and without the gauss - bonnet additional term . in section 5",
    "we will do the same calculation , but now for the tensor quasinormal modes .",
    "it will be interesting to note that , as the energy of the cloud of strings grows , the scalar and tensor spectra approach each other , achieving some kind of isospectrality .",
    "finally , in section 6 we will present our conclusions .",
    "lovelock models of gravity are a natural generalization of general relativity to higher dimensions .",
    "their field equations are up to second order in derivatives of the metric , and constructed in such a way that the energy - momentum tensor of the theory is conserved . in terms of a local frame @xmath2 ,",
    "such that @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the minkowski metric , the n - th order lovelock model of gravity is given by    @xmath5    where    @xmath6    with @xmath7 being a 2-form connection , and @xmath8 the spacetime dimension .",
    "the zero - order action is a cosmological constant term .",
    "the first - order is the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "the second - order term is called gauss - bonnet term . as an example , in @xmath9 dimensions it is given by    @xmath10    the @xmath11-form of curvature can be obtained from the second cartan structure equation , @xmath12 . by its turn , @xmath13 , called spin connection , can be obtained in terms of the _ vielbein _ , given by @xmath14 , using the first cartan structure equation , @xmath15 , where the spacetime is torsion - free .    in coordinate indices",
    ", the action of the second - oder lovelock term reduces to    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the determinant of the metric @xmath18 . in this paper",
    "we will consider both the first and second terms of the action .",
    "this theory is usually called einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "the field equations can be obtained , as usual , by varying the action with respect to the metric . in coordinate indices ,",
    "it is given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 , but we will set @xmath21 .",
    "the tensor @xmath22 is the einstein tensor , given by @xmath23 . by its turn",
    ", @xmath24 is given by    @xmath25    let us consider a schwarzschild - like metric with spherical symmetric ,    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the ( @xmath28)-sphere in a @xmath8 dimensional spacetime .",
    "a vacuum solution of the einstein - gauss - bonnet field equations ( [ egbequation ] ) is the boulware - deser metric ,    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is an integral constant usually chosen so that the boulware - deser metric reduces to schwarzschild metric as @xmath32 . in this paper",
    "we are interest to solve the einstein - gauss - bonnet equations with a energy - momentum tensor duo to a string cloud .",
    "in cosmology , it is usual to consider clouds of matter to model the cold content of the universe .",
    "a cloud of strings is an analogue model , where the zero - dimensional content is replaced by one - dimensional objects , extended along some defined direction . in the present paper",
    ", we will consider strings distributed in a spherical symmetric pattern .    in the same way",
    "as a particle generates a word - line in spacetime , a string generate a two - dimensional world - sheet @xmath33 , parametrized by the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the action for a single string is given by the nambu - goto action ,    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is positive and related to the tension of the string , and @xmath38 is the determinant of the induced metric    @xmath39    the action can also be described by a spacetime bi - vector @xmath40 , given by    @xmath41    such that the nambu - goto action can be written as    @xmath42    the action ( [ ngaction2 ] ) allow us to calculate the energy - momentum tensor for the string in a straightforward way , from the relation @xmath43 .",
    "the energy - tensor of a single string is then given by    @xmath44    and a string cloud can be naturally described by a density of strings , such as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the density of the string cloud .",
    "for a spherically symmetric string configuration , the only non - null component of the bi - vector is @xmath47 .",
    "then , the only non - null components of the energy - momentum tensor of a cloud of strings are given by    @xmath48    the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath49 , allow us to calculate the radial dependence of it .",
    "the equation @xmath50 = 0 , have as solution    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is a constant related with the total energy of the cloud of strings .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of a cloud of strings resembles the energy of a global monopole @xcite , since both describes radial energy flux .",
    "the line element ( [ metric ] ) indicates that only one function is necessary to describe the metric , namely , @xmath53 . as @xmath54 ,",
    "@xmath55 representing any indice of the @xmath56-sphere , the function @xmath53 should obey the vacuum equations for the spherical indices .",
    "thus , we have    @xmath57    where the indice @xmath55 is not contracted .",
    "in general relativity ( first - order lovelock gravity ) , the solution to ( [ eqsphericallovelock ] ) is given by    @xmath58    where @xmath31 and @xmath59 are integration constants .",
    "the constant @xmath31 can be found using the newtonian limit from general relativity , and the constant @xmath59 will be fixed by the other field equations .",
    "we can note that in @xmath60 , the cloud of strings ( and the global monopole ) produces an angular deficit .",
    "we are interested , however , to solve the einstein - gauss - bonnet model .",
    "the easiest way to solve the field equations is to determine the vacuum @xmath61 components , and to fix the integration constant inserting the obtained function in the @xmath62 component of the field equations .",
    "this gives us an answer which can be written as    @xmath63    where the mass @xmath64 term was fixed by demanding that the above solution reduces to the schwarzschild - tangherlini metric as @xmath65 and @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamics of a massless scalar field @xmath66 , in a @xmath8 dimensional spacetime , obeys the klein - gordon equation , @xmath67 .",
    "since we are considering a static background , the field equation can be separated as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 are the usual spherical harmonics .",
    "then , the klein - gordon equation can be reduced to a schrdinger type equation , namely ,    @xmath70    where the tortoise coordinate is defined as @xmath71 , and the effective potential @xmath72 is given by    @xmath73    with @xmath74 being the angular momentum eigenvalue related with the angular momentum operator @xmath75 . in figure ( [ potential ] ) it is plotted several configuration for the potential , varying the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath52 , the angular momentum @xmath74 and the dimension @xmath8 .",
    "we can note that , in all of the situations , the potential appears to be positive in the limit @xmath76 . on the top and bottom left plots , where the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath1 are varying , the peak and height of the potential changes , but asymptotically it looks like the same .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in figure ( [ tensorvariaalpha ] ) the parameter @xmath52 is fixed , and we vary the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "one more time , for some fixed @xmath77 , the value of the imaginary mode stop to decrease and start to increase . in this plot is more evident that the value for @xmath77 increases as the parameter @xmath52 increases .",
    "we also consider as an important result the fact that the values for the scalar and tensor quasinormal modes approaches each other as the parameter @xmath52 increases . in the absence of the string cloud ,",
    "there is not an isospectrality between the scalar and tensor modes , as noted in @xcite .",
    "we can see in figure ( [ iso ] ) , however , that such isospectrality appears to occurs for large values of the parameter @xmath52 .",
    "we have obtained the massless quasinormal modes for a black hole , with a cloud of strings , in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "we did it for a scalar test field , and also for the perturbed metric field .",
    "we have used the fifth order wkb approximation for the former , and the third order wkb for the latter .",
    "the reason to not use the fifth order for the tensor fields was mainly a computational issue , since the equations for the perturbed metric field are more complex and demand much more computational efforts to do this computation .",
    "we have focused on the role played by the parameter @xmath52 , related to the energy of the string cloud , and also by the parameter @xmath1 , which parametrize how the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity differs from general relativity . for the @xmath0 and @xmath65 ,",
    "the spacetime solution is the schwarzschild metric , and for @xmath65 and @xmath78 , the solution is the boulware - deser metric .",
    "we have found that , as @xmath52 grows , both the normal and imaginary parts of the modes decreases .",
    "this indicates that the frequency of emission is smaller when compared with the same system without the string cloud .",
    "it also indicates that the emission occurs for a longer period of time , since the damping ( parametrized by the imaginary part of the qnms ) is smaller when the cloud of strings is present .",
    "another important result we can mention is related with the constant @xmath77 .",
    "as was already knew @xcite , as we increase the parameter @xmath1 starting from zero ( the general relativity limit ) , the imaginary part of the qnms ( both scalar and tensor ) initially decreases until it reaches the value @xmath77 , when it starts to increase .",
    "we denoted this _ turning point _",
    "by @xmath77 , and our analysis shows that @xmath77 is a function of the energy of the cloud of strings , and increases as the energy increases .",
    "one last result we should mention is when we compare the scalar and tensor qnms .",
    "it was argued that these modes should be equal in vacuum @xcite , but latter it was shown @xcite that this was not the case , and that the scalar and tensor values of the qnms become more and more different as @xmath1 increases .",
    "we have show that indeed the scalar and tensor qnms are different , but as we increase the parameter @xmath52 , these values approaches each other . apparently , when @xmath79 , the scalar and tensor modes acquire the same values .",
