    "this is the point that the @xmath35 mode reaches cutoff at @xmath80 nm , corresponding to a @xmath81 .",
    "the drop in rs power is most pronounced in the longitudinal polarization component in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoffs](a ) . in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoffs ] , the rs light is constant between @xmath82 mm and @xmath83 mm .",
    "this region , denoted @xmath4 , is the 10-mm - long onf waist .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath35 mode to the total scattered power is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoffs](c ) , indicated by the red dashed lines .",
    "these levels are taken at two symmetric places on opposite sides of the waist with equal radii .    on the output side of the waist ,",
    "the total rs power increases slightly .",
    "this is again a consequence of surface scattering . for this onf ,",
    "@xmath84 nm and is also very close to the cutoff for the @xmath5 and @xmath8 modes . at this radius ,",
    "the remaining hollow modes have a significant evanescent field and low surface field . as the radius increases on the output , the evanescent field reduces and the surface field increases , indicated by the larger rs power near @xmath85 mm .",
    "the surface field reaches a maximum near @xmath86 nm , beyond which the field becomes more strongly confined inside the fiber and the surface scattering reduces .",
    "the rs power continues to drop as more of the field is confined to the bulk of the onf .    the polarization discrimination of fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoffs ] , combined with the cutoff of the @xmath35 mode , helps identify the remaining amount of the @xmath5 and @xmath8 modes .",
    "this is because the @xmath8 mode has no longitudinal field and it should not contribute to any of the power seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : cutoffs](a ) . since the @xmath35 modes are ejected from the waveguide , and scattering still exists in the transverse direction but not in the longitudinal direction , we know that the majority of the total rs power on the waist is due to the @xmath8 mode .",
    "we note that there is some residual longitudinal component that could be caused by a small @xmath5 or @xmath34 background that is not observable in the spectrogram .",
    "it could also be due to deviations from pure dipolar scattering  @xcite .",
    "@xcite notes that the longitudinal scattering was significantly larger than expected , even in unmodified fibers with negligible longitudinal fields .",
    "these results indicate that pure @xmath8 modes can be identified by minimizing the longitudinally - polarized rs light .",
    "we have shown that rayleigh scattering is an excellent diagnostic of propagation phenomena in axially - tailored nanofibers .",
    "rayleigh scattering enables direct observation of the propagation throughout an optical nanofiber , allowing us to demonstrate control of the mode superpositions on the nanofiber waist . by measuring the variation of the beat lengths",
    ", we can determine the local fiber radius to within 3 nanometers using entirely optical means .",
    "the ability to measure and identify modes in high transmission , few - mode onfs opens the possibility of controlling hom - based evanescent traps for atoms .",
    "this tool could also be extended to integrated waveguide approaches to atom traps  @xcite .",
