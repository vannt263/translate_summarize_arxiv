    "the problem of the time evolution of the shape of crystal surfaces has a long history dating back to mullins and herring who considered relaxation during annealing above the roughening temperature  @xcite .",
    "more recently , shape relaxation below the roughening temperature has been studied extensively  @xcite . below the roughening temperature",
    "the problem is complicated by the need to keep track of the dynamics of atomic steps and the fact that the surface free energy of crystal facets is singular .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have extended the theory of shape relaxation below the roughening temperature to include the effects of atom deposition , and use this theory to explain the self limiting v - grooves observed in organo - metallic chemical vapor deposition ( omcvd ) growth on corrugated gaas substrates . in this paper",
    "we present a new continuum model which we use to interpret measurements of the shape of corrugated gaas ( 100 ) surfaces under growth conditions which do not produce faceting .",
    "facets are not present in our experiments due to atomic scale roughness associated with atom deposition in the island growth mode , and the fact that the surface topography is sufficiently weak that the surface slope does not reach the low energy [ 111 ] facets .",
    "we show that this model reproduces the surface morphology that develops during molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) regrowth on 1d surface gratings .",
    "the evolution of long wavelength surface structures during gaas homoepitaxy can be described by the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation  @xcite : @xmath0 . the coefficients in this equation are constants characterizing the microscopic atomic processes .",
    "the source term @xmath1 simulates the random arrival of atoms at an average rate @xmath2 . according to this equation",
    ", a textured starting surface will develop parabolic mounds that smooth with time separated by v - shaped valleys .",
    "recent experimental work  @xcite has shown that the kpz equation provides an accurate description of the morphology of epitaxially grown gaas layers for surfaces with local slopes @xmath3 . the agreement with",
    "this simple continuum model suggests that the anomalous effects associated with the singular free energy of crystal facets are not important for the growth conditions in question .",
    "in the case of gaas molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) growth in which there is no re - evaporation , the simplest explanation for the linear term in the kpz equation is that it is due to an inverse ehrlich - schwoebel ( es ) effect  @xcite in which surface adatoms approaching a descending step are more likely to descend over the step rather than being reflected from it , due to a step edge potential barrier .",
    "this creates a downhill flux of adatoms ( @xmath4 ) and a smoothing term ( @xmath5 ) identical to the first term in the kpz equation  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the atomic scale dynamics is complex with surface reconstructions , complicated step edge geometries , and a two component ( ga , as ) surface  @xcite .",
    "the sign of the es effect in gaas is controversial  @xcite , but we show below that a negative es effect , favoring downhill flow ( stable growth ) is consistent with the experimental data .    the nonlinear term in kpz is associated with growth along the outward normal , as in chemical vapor deposition . in this case , @xmath6 should be equal to the growth rate @xmath2 .",
    "however , the value for @xmath6 needed to simulate the experimental results is almost two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath2  @xcite . also , the kpz nonlinearity is non - conservative , whereas mbe growth is conservative with a growth rate that is independent of the surface shape .",
    "m@xmath7 showing the effect of atom deposition on the smoothing rate .",
    "the sample roughens during a temperature ramp to remove the surface oxide at about 5 minutes in the figure , which is followed by relatively fast smoothing during a high temperature ( 620@xmath8c ) anneal for about 7 minutes , and then slower smoothing during annealing at growth temperature ( 550@xmath8c ) . ]    c and ( b )  a sample annealed for 15 minutes at growth temperature 595@xmath8c after 40 minutes of growth . ]    in addition , the kpz description with constant coefficients is not consistent with experiments which show that the smoothing rate depends on the growth rate .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ ls ] we show the scattered light intensity from a gaas surface during an interruption in growth on a randomly textured substrate .",
    "the intensity of scattered light is proportional to the power spectral density of the surface topography at a spatial frequency @xmath9 determined by geometrical factors  @xcite ( in this case @xmath9=41@xmath10m@xmath7 , corresponding to a lateral surface length - scale of about 150 nm ) . for low amplitude surface textures , in the kpz model the surface should smooth exponentially with a characteristic rate given by @xmath11 where @xmath9 is the spatial frequency of the surface roughness  @xcite . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ ls ] , the smoothing rate responds immediately to changes in the growth flux ; it is faster during deposition and slower during annealing , suggesting that @xmath12 is flux dependent .",
    "this continued smoothing of the surface in the absence of an atom flux indicates that the physical mechanisms at play on the surface still favor a net downhill migration of surface adatoms , even after the flux of atoms from the vapor has been turned off .",
    "insight into why the smoothing rate depends on the flux can be obtained by comparing an atomic force microscope ( afm ) image from a sample which is fast cooled ( quenched ) after growth with the afm image of a surface which has been annealed ( see figs .",
    "[ afm]a and b ) .",
    "the quenched sample ( a ) is covered with small islands , whereas the annealed sample ( b ) has broad terraces with few islands .",
    "the small islands must coalesce into the step edges during annealing .",
    "the kinetic barrier to the adatom coalescence into the step edges , causes the growth process to be non - local in space and time , in contrast to kpz",
    ". a high density of steps at one location that absorb adatoms will affect the adatom density and hence the growth rate at another nearby location .",
    "the growth phenomena discussed above can be explained in a natural way if we extend the growth model to include the adatom dynamics explicitly with two coupled growth equations ( cge )  @xcite :    @xmath13    [ btseqns ]    eqn .",
    "[ btsn ] is a continuity equation for the adatom density @xmath14 with source and sink terms , while eqn .",
    "[ btsh ] describes the time dependence of the surface height @xmath15 , which depends on the dimer nucleation rate and the net adatom attachment rate at steps .",
    "the constants are defined in atomic units as follows : @xmath2 - deposition rate from the vapor , @xmath16 - adatom diffusion coefficient , @xmath17 - density of steps , @xmath18 - rate of thermal evaporation of atoms from step edges into the adatom phase , and @xmath19 is the sticking coefficient for an adatom at a step edge . an adatom is defined as a diffusing unit on the surface , which could be a ga atom or a ga - as complex . we also define :    @xmath20    [ suppeqns ]    where in eqn .",

    "[ btsh ] , any adatom that attaches to a step edge is assumed to have incorporated into the film .",
    "the downhill drift parameter @xmath23 can be positive or negative : a positive value favors downhill drift of adatoms , consistent with the surface smoothing that is observed experimentally for gaas @xmath24  @xcite ( and also consistent with a negative value for the es energy barrier ) .    in equation  [ seqn ] , we present a physically plausible hypothesis for the dependence of the rms step density on the surface slope . in this expression the random local surface slope associated with the growth - induced step density @xmath25 is added to the deterministic macroscopic surface slope @xmath26 . since the local slope associated with the background step density @xmath25 is random , the two terms add in quadrature . in equation",
    "[ seqn ] , we assume that the background step density is independent of the macroscopic surface slope .",
    "we expect @xmath25 to depend on temperature and deposition rate , and on time in the case of growth interrupts ( see fig .  [ afm]a and b )  @xcite . the simple picture of a surface consisting of flat terraces separated by atomic steps ,",
    "can be expected to provide a good description as long as the surface slope does not reach the next low index crystal planes , namely ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) .",
    "these planes are @xmath27 and @xmath28 from the surface normal , and beyond the range of surface slopes that we have explored experimentally ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we assume that the density of random steps @xmath25 is independent of the topography . in this approximation ,",
    "the average step density is proportional to the rms value of the local surface slope .",
    "the expression for @xmath17 is then constructed by averaging over the random orientation of the local slope , and the rms step density is given by the incoherent sum of the two contributing factors .    for low amplitudes and long wavelength ( @xmath30 )",
