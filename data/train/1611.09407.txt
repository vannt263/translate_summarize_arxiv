    "a graded manifold of type @xmath3 , the notion that we introduce , is a natural generalization of the notion of a non - negatively @xmath5-graded manifold of degree @xmath4 .",
    "we work in the category of smooth or complex - analytic graded manifolds and we use the language of the theory of sheaves and ringed spaces as in the theory of supermanifolds @xcite .    graded manifolds of degree @xmath4 were studied by different authors for instance in the framework of the theories of lie algebroids , courant algebroids , double lie algebroids and their higher generalizations @xcite .",
    "we can define a non - negatively graded manifold of degree @xmath4 as a supermanifold that possesses an atlas with homogeneous coordinates with weights or degrees labeled by integers @xmath6 , see @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study non - negatively @xmath7-graded manifolds , where @xmath8 . in case @xmath9 the notion of a degree of a graded manifold is not sufficient to characterize the corresponding category . to illustrate this observation , consider the two times iterated tangent bundle @xmath10 of a manifold @xmath11 .",
    "the structure sheaf of @xmath10 is naturally @xmath12-graded .",
    "indeed , on @xmath10 we can choose local charts with coordinates in the following form : @xmath13 where @xmath14 are local coordinates on the manifold @xmath11 , we assume that they have weight @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the first and the second de rham differentials .",
    "we assume that the local coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 have weights @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we see that this is a graded manifold of degree @xmath0 with respect to the total degree .",
    "however in the @xmath12-graded case we can be more precise and consider graded manifolds of degree @xmath24 , in the @xmath25-graded case we should consider graded manifolds of degree @xmath26 and so on . from this point of view",
    "@xmath10 is a graded manifold of degree @xmath23 .",
    "another observation here is that the numbers @xmath27 also do not describe the whole picture .",
    "for example we can consider a category of graded manifolds of degree @xmath28 such that any object in this category possess an atlas with local coordinates of degrees @xmath15 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we see that in this case we can specify the definition of a graded manifold of degree @xmath28 and consider the category of graded manifolds of type @xmath31 .",
    "in addition we can think about @xmath0-tuples @xmath15 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 as about vectors in @xmath32 , where @xmath33 or @xmath34 , and introduce a monoid or a weight system @xmath35 that parametrizes degrees of local coordinates , see definition [ de weight system ] for details .",
    "summing up in this paper we study a more precise notion of a non - negatively @xmath7-graded manifold , i.e. the notion of a graded manifold of type @xmath3 .",
    "in addition we assume that local coordinates have parities that are related but not determined by the weights from @xmath3 as in @xcite .",
    "this approach allows to reduce some questions about graded manifolds of type @xmath3 to the study of the combinatorics of the monoid @xmath3 .",
    "for example , we consider the root system @xmath36 , i.e. the root system of the lie algebra @xmath37 .",
    "then some reflections in this root system corresponds to the dualization process in the theory of double vector bundles @xcite , see section @xmath38 for details .",
    "another application of this approach is a more precise definition of an @xmath4-fold vector bundle .",
    "for instance this allows to distinguish the categories of double vector bundles and of double vector bundles with the trivial core .",
    "we introduce the notion of multiplicity free weight system @xmath3 and study @xmath4-fold vector bundles of type @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the rank of @xmath3 , see definitions [ de n - fold vector bundle ] , [ de multiplicity free weight system ] and [ de n - fold vector bundle general ] .",
    "a geometrization process is a functor from the category of graded manifolds to the category of usual manifolds .",
    "such functors are well - known , for example functor of points for graded or supermanifolds and linearisation functor @xcite .",
    "often it is interesting to describe explicitly classical manifolds that arise from graded manifolds .",
    "the goal of this paper is to give such a description for graded manifolds of type @xmath3 . for motivation to study this question ,",
    "consider the following tableau .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     here @xmath39 is an odd homological vector field .",
    "the first column of this tableau represents the wold of the classical or commutative geometry , while the second column characterizes the world of supergeometry . in supergeometry together with usual `` boson - type '' or commuting or even variables one considers `` fermion - type '' or anticommuting or odd or ghost variables .",
    "this is a natural language to describe the sypersymmetry in physics .",
    "recently it was discovered that the language of supergeometry is very useful for example in the theory of different types of lie algebroids .",
    "for instance a.  vaintrob @xcite established an equivalence of categories of lie algebroids and graded manifolds of degree @xmath40 ( or in other words supermanifolds with a fixed @xmath41-grading ) with a homological vector field @xmath39 of degree @xmath42 .",
    "this equivalence is represented in the first line of our tableau .",
    "sometimes the super point of view leads to an essential simplification of the theory of lie algebroids .",
    "for example , the definition of a lie algebroid morphism is non - trivial . at the same time",
    ", this definition has a natural reformulation in terms of homological vector fields .",
    "the geometrization process is a `` map '' from the second column to the first one . in the case of lie algebroids",
    "however this process is trivial since graded manifolds of degree @xmath40 are in one - to - one correspondence with vector bundles . in this case",
    "the important part is the additional structure , i.e. the homological vector field @xmath39 .",
    "the second line of the tableau is devoted to the result of p.  evera @xcite and d.  roytenberg @xcite .",
    "they independently showed that the categories of courant algebroids and symplectic graded manifolds of degree @xmath0 with a certain homological vector field @xmath39 are equivalent . in this case the geometrization process was used not directly .",
    "the category of not necessary symplectic graded manifolds of degree @xmath0 was studied by d.  li - bland in @xcite .",
    "his result corresponds to the third line of the tableau .",
    "this is an equivalence of the category of graded manifolds of degree @xmath0 with a certain homological vector field @xmath39 and the category of metric double vector bundles with the structure of vb - courant algebroid ( vb means `` vector bundle '' ) . in other words , to any graded manifold of degree @xmath0 , li - bland assigned a usual manifold : metric double vector bundle and determined additional structures that corresponds to homological vector fields @xmath39 .",
    "more about applications of courant algebroids and vb algebroid can be found in @xcite .",
    "other results in this direction were obtained in @xcite . in these papers",
    "the authors assigned a usual manifold , more precise a double vector bundle with different types of additional structures , to a graded manifold of degree @xmath0 and studied structures determined by a homological vector field @xmath39 .",
    "we see that a natural question is to investigate the last line of this tableau . in this paper",
    "we study this problem for non - negatively @xmath2-graded manifolds of type @xmath3 . due to the complexity we consider graded manifolds without any additional vector fields",
    ". this question is left for the future .    while preparation of this paper in the literature appeared another result in this direction @xcite .",
    "the authors study there graded bundles of degree @xmath43 that is related to our graded manifolds of type @xmath3 in the case @xmath44 .",
    "more precisely in @xcite the authors constructed a functor called the full linearization functor from the category of graded bundles of degree @xmath43 ( graded manifolds of degree @xmath43 in our sense , i.e. the parities of coordinates not necessary coincide with the parities of degrees ) to the category of symmetric @xmath43-fold vector bundles with a family of morphisms that are parametrized by the symmetric group @xmath45 .",
    "they showed that this functor is an equivalence of categories .",
    "note that in the present paper we consider a different category of @xmath43-fold vector bundles , i.e. @xmath43-fold vector bundles of type @xmath3 with a family of odd commuting vector fields .",
    "our results can be described as follows .",
    "we fix a weight system @xmath46 of rank @xmath47 and the parity of the basic weights , see definition [ de weight system ] . then we construct the corresponding multiplicity free weight system @xmath48 of rank @xmath49 .",
    "these two weight systems determine the category @xmath3 of graded manifolds of type @xmath3 and the category @xmath50 of @xmath49-fold vector bundles of type @xmath50 .",
    "further we construct a functor @xmath51 @xmath3@xmath52 @xmath50 . here",
    "our ideas are similar to the ideas from @xcite , but we came to this construction independently : we use @xmath53-iterated tangent bundle @xmath54 of a graded manifold @xmath55 .",
    "further we introduce the category @xmath50 of @xmath49-fold vector bundles of type @xmath50 with @xmath53 odd commuting homological vector fields .",
    "these vector fields arise from the iterated de rham differentials defined in the structure sheaf of @xmath54 .",
