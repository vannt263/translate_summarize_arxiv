    "in adaptive - optics ( ao ) systems the wavefront sensing is commonly performed with shack - hartmann ( sh ) sensors@xcite or roddier curvature sensors ( rc)@xcite . both types of wavefront sensors have been successfully employed in fields such as astronomy@xcite or ophthalmology@xcite,@xcite , @xcite  with up to 188 sensing elements in the case of rc sensors@xcite and nearly a thousand elements in the case of sh sensors@xcite . for the next generation of adaptive optic systems , with increasingly larger numbers of elements ,",
    "it is of interest to compare  for different numbers , @xmath0 , of sensing elements  the two techniques in terms of the error - propagation factor , i.e. the ratio of the standard error of the inferred phase estimates to that of the measured signal .",
    "the error - propagation factor , @xmath3 , for sh sensors has been found to increase logarithmically with the number , @xmath0 , of sensing elements when their spacing is kept constant and the pupil surface is increased@xcite , @xcite .",
    "simulations by n. roddier have shown that under the same condition , the error propagation , @xmath4 , for rc sensors increases linearly with @xmath0@xcite . for a constant pupil surface ",
    "i.e. if more sensing elements are packed on the same aperture ",
    "@xmath4 is almost independent of @xmath0@xcite .    here",
    ", the ratio , @xmath5 , of the error - propagation factors for rc and sh sensors is examined in relation to the number of sensing elements , on a circular aperture .",
    "the ratio is found to increase as @xmath1 when the spacing of the sensing elements is fixed .",
    "it increases even faster , roughly as @xmath2 , when more sensing elements are placed on a given aperture .",
    "in practice the wavefront reconstruction is performed in terms of matrices that are pre - calculated for the particular ao system .",
    "a _ command matrix _ of voltages is sent to the set of mirror actuators so that in combination with their _ influence function _ ,",
    "i.e. the matrix of phase shifts caused by a unit shift ( voltage increment ) of an actuator , the correct _ reconstruction matrix _ of phase increments is obtained . in other words , the _ reconstruction matrix _ that transforms the measured _ slope _ or _ curvature _ values into the phase estimates is realized as the ` product ' of the _ command matrix _ and the _ influence function_.    while the actual reconstruction algorithms differ , they all contain  regardless whether they are used with sh- or rc - sensors  the solution of the laplace equation in terms of _ mean - curvature _ values .",
    "separation of the error propagation into the two inherent steps _ sensor signal _ to _ curvature _ and then _ curvature _ to _ phase estimates _ will , thus , make the analysis more transparent without changing the results .",
    "for an orthogonal grid of sensors the linkage between _ slope _ and _ curvature _ values is straight - forward . for the common radially symmetric arrangements of curvature sensors",
    "it is more complicated .",
    "the reconstruction formalism is then still based on the solution of the laplace equation in terms of the _ mean curvatures _ , and the algorithm that is described in section 2.c ( and is employed in sections 4 and 5 ) will still apply in just slightly modified form",
    ". however the separation of the two steps of error propagation is most transparent for an orthogonal pattern of sensors , and this special case will bring out the essential characteristics of error propagation for sh and for rc sensors .      let the _ phases _ at the sensor position @xmath6 be @xmath7 . only the phase _ differences _ are of interest .",
    "they are measured in @xmath8- and @xmath9-direction by sh sensors and are termed _",
    "slopes_. the relation between the true , i.e. error - free values are : @xmath10",
    "the _ mean curvatures _ are measured by rc sensors : @xmath11 analogous relations that include less than 4 adjacent sensors apply to the sensors at the boundary of the aperture .",
    "in actuality , the variables @xmath12 or @xmath13 are slopes times grid spacing , @xmath14 , and the @xmath15 are mean curvatures times @xmath16 , i.e. all variables are phase increments . to distinguish the variables _ slope _ and _ curvature _ from the slope and curvature proper they are written in _ italics _ ,",
    "the latter are written in roman .      as shown in earlier analyses ( e.g. hudgin@xcite ) ,",
    "each phase estimate , @xmath7 , is a linear combination of the elements @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the _ slope _ matrices : @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the reconstruction matrices from _ slopes _ to phase estimates , @xmath7 . with regard to the _",
    "mean curvatures _ one can use the same concept , but with different reconstruction matrices : @xmath22 even where _ slopes _ are measured they are converted into _ curvatures _ , because the less complicated eq.[eq:4 ] provides the same phase estimates as eq.[eq:3 ] .",
    "the reconstruction matrices @xmath23 depend on the sensor grid and position ; they are pre - calculated for a given ao setup .",
    "a given set of _ curvatures _ determines the best phase estimates , i.e. the estimates that are the least - squares fit to the measured _ curvatures _ or the underlying _",
    "slopes_. starting with an arbitrary set , @xmath7 , of estimates the value on every grid point is replaced in each iteration step by the average of the 4 adjacent values , with adjustment for the measured _ slope _ or the corresponding _ curvature _ data@xcite : @xmath24    the new value @xmath7 fits best the preceding phase estimates at the adjacent 4 grid points and the measured _ slope _ or _ curvature _ data .",
    "the analogous relations for sensor positions on the edge of the pupil which have only 1 , 2 , or 3 neighbors are evident and are not listed .",
    "the interior _ curvature _ values contain no information on tip and tilt .",
    "the procedure converges to the least - squares solution . depending on @xmath0 ,",
    "several hundred iterations may be required , but the procedure converges correctly .",
    "the iterative procedure is simple and transparent , but the direct solution by inversion of one large matrix that connects phases and _ mean curvatures _ is a convenient alternative .",
    "to employ it one arranges the variables for the different sensor positions as vectors , rather than matrices .",
    "this is merely a change of notation ; instead of dealing with a matrix of matrices as in eq.[eq:4 ] one deals with a single matrix equation : @xmath25    in this alternative description @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the vectors of the phase values and the _ mean curvatures_. they contain @xmath0 elements , where @xmath0 is the number of sensors . @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the analogous notation for the _ slopes_. the @xmath28 matrix @xmath29 contains in each row at the appropriate positions the term -1 and four terms 1/4 when the phase corresponds to an interior position . for positions on the boundary of the sensor grid",
    "there are , apart from -1 , three terms 1/3 , two terms 1/2 , or one term 1 .",
    "if all phases are equal , the _ curvature _ vector , @xmath27 , is zero , which shows that the matrix @xmath29 is singular .",
    "the reconstruction relation contains , therefore , instead of the familiar inverse the pseudo - inverse , @xmath30 , of @xmath29 :    @xmath31    eq.[eq : frc ] is the equivalent of eq.[eq:4 ] .",
    "the column of the matrix @xmath30 that corresponds to the sensor position @xmath32 in eq.[eq:4 ] is a vectorial representation of the matrix @xmath33 .",
    "also it is readily seen that the equivalent of eq.[eq:3 ] is :    @xmath34    where each column in the two matrices @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the difference of the two columns in @xmath30 that correspond to the pair of sensor positions associated with the _ slope _ @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the vectorial representation of the _ slopes , mean curvatures _ and phases is utilized only in section 5 , where eqs.[eq : frc ] and [ eq : frxy ] are used to obtain , for sensor numbers up to @xmath37 , the error - propagation factors for rc and sh sensors .",
    "the use there of the inversion algorithm is a matter of convenience . in the absence of tools to handle very large matrices",
    "the iterative method serves the same purpose .",
    "the different types of wavefront sensors have particular strengths and limitations that determine their applicability",
    ". the present discussion is directed at one characteristic of sh and rc sensors : the different propagation of measurement errors to phase - estimation errors .",
    "let @xmath38 and @xmath39 be the measured signals of the sh and rc sensors ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 are dimensionless values that can  with coefficients specified in the subsequent section  be converted to the _ slope _ and _ mean curvature _ values .    if @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the standard errors of the sh and rc signals , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , then the phase errors , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are the products of the errors @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the _ error - propagation factors _ , @xmath44 and @xmath45 :    @xmath46    the exploration of these error - propagation factors will",
    ", as indicated in fig.[fig : scheme ] , be separated into two steps .",
    "the first step considers the two fairly trivial partial factors from @xmath40 and @xmath41 to the standard errors of the _ mean curvatures _ :",
    "@xmath47    this step requires the specification of the calibration factors from sh- or rc - sensor signal to _",
    "mean curvature _ , which will be detailed in the next section .",
    "the second step  which is the major part of this study  is the determination of the propagation factors from the _ mean curvature _ errors to the phase errors , @xmath42 and @xmath43 : @xmath48    the error propagation for rc and for sh sensors will be compared in terms of the ratio : @xmath49    @xmath50 and @xmath51 are considered in the next section in relation to the number , @xmath0 , of sensors .",
    "sections [ sec : analytic ] and [ sec : sim ] will subsequently deal with the second step , the error propagation from _",
    "mean curvature _ to phase .",
    "the signal , @xmath38 , equals the measured displacement of the image in the detector plane  in units of pixel size , @xmath52 .",
    "the relation between the _ slope _ value @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath12 or @xmath13 , and the signal , @xmath38 , of the sh sensor is@xcite : @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the wavelength , @xmath56 the focal distance of the sh lenslets , and @xmath14 the grid spacing .",
    "the same relation applies to the standard errors , @xmath57 and @xmath40 , of @xmath53 and @xmath38 . to obtain the expression for @xmath58 one needs , in addition , the relation between @xmath57 and the standard error , @xmath59 , of the _ mean curvature _ derived from the _ slope _ values .",
    "this relation is simple , since the standard error of the _ mean curvature _ equals  for internal sensors ",
    "half the standard error of the _ slope _ values ( see eq.[eq:2 ] ) . for the sensors on the boundary",
    "the value is somewhat larger , but averaged over all sensors the difference can be disregarded  especially for large @xmath0 . with the factor 1/2",
    "one obtains :    @xmath60    when @xmath0 is increased , while the grid distance , @xmath14 , and the size of the sub - apertures remain the same , @xmath61 and @xmath56 are kept constant .",
    "the error - propagation factor , @xmath58 , is then independent of @xmath0 .    on the other hand , when more sensors are packed on the same aperture , the focal length , @xmath56 , of the shack - hartmann lenses is generally increased in order to keep the amplitude of the image motions constant in the detector plane . since the amplitude of the sensed phase distortions decreases with sub - aperture size as @xmath62 @xcite , @xmath56 is adjusted proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "one concludes that the error propagation from the sh sensor signal to _",
    "mean curvature _ is then roughly inverse to the number of sensors : @xmath64      the relation between the _ mean curvature _ , @xmath27 , and the signal , @xmath39 , of the rc sensors is@xcite",
    ": @xmath65 accordingly : @xmath66    again , the error - propagation factor is independent of @xmath0 , when @xmath0 is increased , while the grid distance , @xmath14 , and the size of the sub - apertures remain the same .    when more sensors are packed on the same aperture , the telescope focal length , @xmath67 , remains unchanged , but the extra - focal distance , @xmath68 , of the curvature sensor is increased proportional to @xmath69 , so that the size @xmath70 , of the sensing elements in the detector plane stays constant .",
    "it follows , that @xmath71    eqs.[e1sh ] and [ e1rc ] imply that the ratio , @xmath51 , increases when more sensors , @xmath0 , are packed on the same aperture : @xmath72",
    "it is not surprising that the error propagation from _ curvature _ to phase estimation should be somewhat worse for the directly determined _",
    "mean curvatures_. broadly speaking , a measurement error of the _ slope _ at a sensor position causes an imprecise estimate of the local phase increment only , while an error of the measured _ curvature _ causes an imprecise estimate of the rate of phase increments , which then affects also distant estimates of phase increments .",
    "this is analogous to reconstructing a function of a single variable from its imprecisely measured second derivative , which is less stable than reconstructing it from the imprecisely measured first derivative . while there is , thus , no particular need to explain the difference , it is still helpful to consider the issue in analytical terms before numerical results are derived in section[sec : sim ] .",
    "the observed _ slopes _ or _ mean curvatures _ and the phase estimates are the sum of the true values and the errors . since the reconstruction is additive , the errors of the phase estimates depend  regardless of the true _ slope _ , _ curvature _ and phase values  only on the measurement errors .",
    "the subsequent considerations are therefore simplified by taking the true values to be zero , so that the _ slope _ and _ mean curvature _ values @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath73 stand for the errors only .    to facilitate the comparison of error propagation",
    ", two different procedures will be invoked that generate sets of _ mean curvatures _ as obtained with sh and rc sensors .",
    "both procedures start out by simulating independent and unbiased random _ slope _ errors ; the mean square of these errors is set equal to 4 , so that the mean square of the corresponding @xmath73 is unity .",
    "the boundary effect is here disregarded , i.e. all measured _ curvatures _ are treated as interior values that are linked to 4 _ slope _ values .",
    "the boundary could be accounted for , but this aspect is here not essential .",
    "procedure a corresponds to the use of sh sensors ; it generates one set of @xmath74 _ slope _ errors , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and derives from these values , in line with eq.[eq:2 ] , the set of _ mean curvatures _",
    ", @xmath73 .",
    "adjacent values @xmath73 are then to some degree correlated .",
    "procedure b simulates _ separately _ for each position , @xmath32 , the four associated random errors @xmath75 , and @xmath18 , and derives from them the _ curvature _ error , @xmath73 . as with procedure",
    "a , the resulting mean square _ curvature _ error , @xmath76 , is unity , but the @xmath73 are now uncorrelated , i.e. they resemble a set of _ mean curvatures _ obtained with rc sensors .",
    "consider first the case of merely one single _",
    "error , say @xmath77 . with procedure",
    "a this error , @xmath77 , corresponds to the two _ mean curvature _ errors , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the addition of these two terms according to eq.[eq:4 ] gives the associated phase errors : @xmath80    one obtains the corresponding mean square phase error : @xmath81 \\nonumber \\\\                & = &    \\epsilon ^2/ 16 \\cdot [ < f(l , m)^2 > - < f(l , m ) > ^2   + <   f(l+1,m)^2 > - <   f(l+1,m)>^2   \\nonumber   \\\\                 & &      - 2 ( < f(l , m ) \\cdot f(l+1,m ) > - < f(l , m ) >",

    "the mean square error is @xmath99 , but the mixed term @xmath100 in the equation below vanishes because of the statistical independence of @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the increment of the mean square phase error is thus : @xmath101    + \\epsilon_1 ^ 2 /16\\cdot [ <   f(l+1,m)^2 > - <   f(l+1,m ) > ^2 ] \\nonumber \\\\         & & - \\epsilon_1\\ , \\epsilon_2 / 8 \\cdot [ < f(l , m ) \\cdot f(l+1,m ) > - < f(l , m ) > \\cdot <",
    "f(l+1,m ) > ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the mixed terms disappear one obtains instead of eq.[eq : e2sh2 ] : @xmath102    this is a notable result : the error - propagation factors differ by the covariance term in eq.[eq : e2sh2 ] .",
    "this term converges with increasing @xmath0 towards the variance , which keeps down the error propagation , when the number of sh sensing elements becomes larger . in the case of independent _ curvatures _",
    "the covariance term is absent .",
    "this increases the error propagation with rc detectors and makes it roughly proportional to @xmath0 , i.e. to the number of terms in eq.[eq : e2rc2 ] .",
    "the above conclusion , the poorer error propagation for _ curvature _ measurements with large sensor numbers , will now be quantified .",
    "for this purpose a large grid of sensors is considered that extends beyond a central region of @xmath0 sensor positions for which the phase estimates are actually sought .",
    "this _ large - grid approximation _ is informative because it entails a simple reconstruction function , @xmath23 , that  regardless of the sensor position , @xmath32  is roughly proportional to the logarithm of the distance between sensor positions .    while the _ large - grid approximation",
    "_ brings out the characteristic difference between the use of _ curvatures _ from sh and rc detectors , it provides results that differ somewhat from the more accurate numerical evaluation in section[sec : sim ] .    with grid spacing @xmath14",
    "the distance of position @xmath103 from the central position , @xmath104 , is : @xmath105    the function @xmath106 has mean curvature zero for @xmath107 , i.e. its laplacian  or twice the mean curvature  vanishes : @xmath108 .",
    "@xmath109 is , therefore  at least at somewhat larger @xmath110 , where the difference quotient equals the differential quotient  a solution for the reconstruction function .",
    "the constant term , @xmath111 , is irrelevant and can be disregarded .",
    "this is in line with the observation that the reconstruction function is independent of @xmath14 , which means that for given _ curvature _ errors the phase errors are the same , regardless whether the grid spacing , @xmath14 , is decreased in order to accommodate a larger number of sensors , or whether @xmath14 is kept constant and the aperture is enlarged .",
    "numerical evaluation in terms of the iterative method shows that : @xmath112 applies exactly at @xmath113 and for large @xmath110 . for intermediate @xmath114",
    "the difference to the exact solution is too small to be of concern for the present approximation .",
    "eq.[eq : fik ] gives the reconstruction function , @xmath115 , for the central sensor position .",
    "for position @xmath32 it is shifted accordingly : @xmath116    fig.[fig:1 ] gives the error - propagation factors @xmath117 and @xmath92 that are obtained by inserting the above expression into eqs.[eq : e2sh2 ] and [ eq : e2rc2 ] , where the variance and covariance are  again with the symbol @xmath118 for average over all @xmath6 : @xmath119    the results are given for symmetric circular sets of sensors on an orthogonal grid .",
    "the center of the grid is on the midpoint between 4 sensors ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the main finding is the very slow increase with @xmath0 of the error propagation from _ curvature _ to phase in the case of the indirectly measured _ curvatures _ ( sh ) , versus the more substantial increase for the directly measured _ curvatures _",
    "( rc ) .",
    "fig.[fig:2 ] gives the corresponding ratio @xmath121 of the error - propagation factors . for sensor numbers up to about 40 ,",
    "@xmath122 is less than 2 , for @xmath123 it is roughly 5.5 .",
    "eqs.[eq : frc ] and [ eq : frxy ] can , largely in analogy to the preceding section , be used to derive exact values of the error - propagation factors @xmath117 and @xmath92 . since the _ mean curvature _",
    "errors from rc detectors are statistically independent , their mean - square contributions to the phase errors add up .",
    "the contribution of the sensor labeled @xmath124 in the vector representation equals therefore the product of the mean - square _ curvature _ error @xmath125 and the sum of the squared components of column @xmath124 in the reconstruction matrix , @xmath30 . since the contributions of all sensors add up , the mean squared phase error equals the sum of all squared components of @xmath30 .",
    "the error - propagation factor is thus :    @xmath126    to compute the error propagation with sh detectors one must go back  as in the considerations in the previous section  to the _ slope _ errors , i.e. one needs to use eq.[eq : frxy ] instead of eq.[eq : frc ] .",
    "each of the columns of the matrices @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , as pointed out in section[sec:2c ] , the differences of two associated columns of @xmath30 .",
    "the sum of the squared matrix elements is , therefore , in analogy to eq.[eq : e2sh2 ] , the sum of the squares of the elements of @xmath30 minus a sum of the product of associated elements .",
    "this provides the relation : @xmath127    the diamonds in fig.[fig:3 ] give the results . while the dependences on @xmath0 agree essentially with those in fig.[fig:1 ] , the absolute values of @xmath117 and @xmath92 are larger than in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "this is not surprising , because the approximation in section[sec:4b ] has inherent symmetry that excludes tip and tilt . for a further comparison it is therefore informative to determine the phase errors with tip and tilt correction .",
    "they are given in fig.[fig:3 ] by the smaller dots .",
    "the correction for tip and tilt reduces the phase - estimation errors substantially , especially for the rc data .",
    "the contribution of tip and tilt is seen to almost double the standard error of the phase estimates in the case of directly measured _ curvatures _ , which means that it contributes predominantly to the variance of the phase - estimation errors . for _ curvature _ values derived in terms of sh sensors the relative contribution of tip and tilt is markedly less ; it contributes about half of the variance .",
    "the analytical approximation in section[sec:4b ] has been solely based on the _",
    "mean curvatures_. since these carry no information on tip and tilt , the curves in fig.[fig:1 ] should correspond to the results in fig.[fig:3 ] without tip and tilt .",
    "they run , in fact , below the curves that include tip and tilt , but lie above those without tip and tilt , which reflects inaccuracies due to the large grid - approximation .",
    "overall , however , there is reasonable agreement , and the essential finding is , that the curves for the rc detectors in figs.[fig:1 ] and [ fig:3 ] have the same slope of about 0.5 , which means that @xmath117 is proportional to @xmath128 .",
    "the curves for the sh detectors exhibit a slope close to 0.1 , i.e. they show that @xmath117 increases roughly proportional to @xmath129 ; over the relevant range of @xmath0 the slow increase is equally in accord with a logarithmic dependence as earlier reported by hudgin@xcite and by fried@xcite .",
    "fig.[fig:4 ] gives the ratios @xmath122 that corresponds to fig.[fig:3 ] . with tip and tilt",
    "excluded @xmath122 reaches the value 2 at @xmath130 and exceeds 4 at @xmath37 .",
    "the values without tip and tilt correction are about 1.5 times larger , but they are not highly relevant , because in ao the use of rc detectors is commonly combined with measurements to allow tip and tilt correction .",
    "shack - hartmann _ slope _ detectors and roddier _ curvature _ sensors have particular strengths and limitations that determine their applicability .",
    "the present analysis has been concerned with one characteristic of the wavefront sensors , the propagation of measurement errors to phase - estimation errors . with either type of sensor the standard error of the phase estimates",
    "is proportional to the standard error of the _ curvature _ values , but the error - propagation factors differ .",
    "the errors of the directly measured _ curvatures _ are statistically independent , and therefore their contributions to the mean - square phase errors add up .",
    "in contrast , when the mean _ curvature _ values are obtained from _ slope _ measurements , adjacent values are negatively correlated and accordingly their mean - square phase - estimation errors combine less than additively .",
    "the results confirm and quantify the earlier findings that the error propagation is larger when the _ curvatures _ are measured directly instead of being derived from measured _",
    "slopes_. the ratio , @xmath131 , of the error - propagation factors for _ curvature _ and _ slope _ measurements is seen to increase roughly as @xmath132 , when the size of the sensing elements is fixed and the pupil size is enlarged . when more sensing elements are packed onto the same pupil , the ratio increases even faster ; @xmath131 is then roughly proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "finally it needs to be noted that the standard errors of the phase estimates are the product of the standard errors of the detector response and the error - propagation factor ( see eq.[eq : sigmaf ] ) . for photon - noise limited measurements ,",
    "the standard error of the detector response is inversely proportional to the square root of the mean number of detected photons , i.e. the product of fluence and the area of the sub - apertures .",
    "since the photon number is inversely proportional to @xmath0 , one concludes that the standard errors of the phase estimates increase even faster with @xmath0 than the error - propagation factors .",
    "the difference in error propagation is not decisive at small or moderate sensor numbers , @xmath0 , and , generally , the error propagation is by no means the only or even the dominant aspect of the applicability of the different types of sensors .",
    "the substantial increase of the error - propagation factor for _ curvature _ detectors at large @xmath0 can nevertheless be a critical factor that needs to be weighed against their various advantages .",
