    "power laws for extinction proportional to @xmath1 result from the specific size distribution of the particles responsible for the extinction without regard for the composition of the particles .",
    "atmospheric aerosol extinction does not necessarily follow a simple linear law ( @xmath4 ) . according to a series of studies in the 1950s to 1970s a power law with @xmath2 of order 1.3 , related to a power law size distribution of particles with exponent 4.3 ,",

    "power extinction laws ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) are thus less restrictive and may provide an alternative to the linear law , maybe in even better agreement with observation .",
    "our purpose is to investigate their properties and implications .",
    "the study is limited to visible and infrared wavelengths extending to the @xmath18 band ( 3.5  @xmath11 ) , beyond which thermal emission from circumstellar dust may contaminate observed extinction curves .",
