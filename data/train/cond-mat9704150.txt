    "collective excitations induced in finite fermion systems by external probes have been extensively studied in the last years .",
    "particular effort has been devoted to the understanding of the giant dipole resonance in nuclei @xcite , and of the plasmon mode in metallic clusters @xcite .",
    "recently , a strong collective state has also been observed in quantum dot structures @xcite .",
    "these collective modes have all in common the feature of being l=1 , s=0 excited states induced by a dipolar external radiation which is the dominant component of the electromagnetic field when its wavelength is much larger than the size of the system .",
    "dipole modes correspond to oscillations of protons against neutrons in nuclei , and of electrons against the positive background in metal clusters and dot structures .",
    "whereas in nuclei the restoring force of the collective motion is the symmetry potential which acts differently on protons than on neutrons , in metal clusters and dots it arises from the coulomb interaction between ions and electrons .    collective states with multipolarity l@xmath21 were predicted to exist and have been observed in nuclei . at present , we have a complete systematics of quadrupole ( l=2 ) and octupole ( l=3 ) collective excitations in nuclei @xcite .",
    "multipole collective states in @xmath3he droplets have also been studied @xcite , but have not been experimentally detected so far . in metal clusters , the predicted multipole states @xcite have not been observed either . the basic reason is the experimental difficulties arising from the fact that free clusters are produced and analyzed on - fly , with the added difficulty in the case of @xmath3he drops of being electrically neutral systems .",
    "far - infrared absorption spectroscopy experiments on large radius quantum dots submitted to a static external magnetic field b have likely evidenced quadrupole excitations @xcite , and an anticrossing between the l=1 and l=2 resonances , each of them splitted in two branches , one with negative and another with positive b - dispersion .",

    "show up for n=30 and 56 because for them , the alignment occurs at b - values higher than those displayed in the figures .",
    "it can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig5 ] that the crossing between @xmath171 and @xmath168 branches does not follow a clear n - systematics .",
    "we have also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the e@xmath55(q@xmath172 ) energies for l=1 and 4 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the scaling energy is reproducing @xmath166 to within 10 - 20 % , since the @xmath168 branch is contributing to m@xmath55(q@xmath91 ) with the same weight as the @xmath166 one , and the negative b - dispersion energies are going to zero rather slowly .",
    "we also display in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( dashed lines ) , the collective energies obtained for a parabolic potential whose @xmath173 has been fixed to 5.6 mev in order to reproduce the @xmath174 energy at b=0 .",
    "it is worth to notice that this value does not equal the one which fits the coulomb potential generated by the 1000 @xmath44 radius disk charged with n@xmath7=125 ions near the origin , which is 4.4 mev , and consequently , @xmath173 has to be interpreted here as an effective parameter to reproduce the dipole energy at zero magnetic field . for l=1 , to the scale of the figure both calculations coincide .",
    "it may be seen that the b - slopes of the @xmath169 branches for l=2 to 4 are roughly the same for the parabolic and disk confining potentials .    at b=0 ,",
    "[ fig6]-[fig7 ] show for n=6 and 56 respectively , the different relative contributions to m@xmath55 coming from kinetic and coulomb energies , as a function of l. the coulomb energy is also decomposed into e - e and dot - electron ( + e ) energies .",
    "these figures show that for small l - values , m@xmath55 is dominated by the ( + e ) contribution , the kinetic and ( e - e ) ones being of minor importance .",
    "however , for a fixed n the kinetic contribution is eventually taking over the coulomb energy contribution .",
    "it occurs at an angular momentum l@xmath175 which increases when n increases . since q@xmath91 behaves as @xmath162 r@xmath93 , the higher the l , the more external its influence on the electronic density .",
    "it means that for large enough l , it just acts on the s.p .",
    "wave functions having the bigger l - angular momentum and radial quantum number n. consequently , it no longer generates collective but s.p . excitations . as collectivity has its origin in interparticle effects , it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that l@xmath175 roughly represents the largest l collective mode the system can sustain , since for l @xmath2 l@xmath175 the restoring force represented by m@xmath55 is basically determined by an independent particle property like the kinetic energy .",
    "this criterion yields l@xmath176 4 , 6 and 8 for n=6 , 30 and 56 , respectively .",
    "we represent in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the energy of modes with l=1 to 4 at b=0 , as a function of the number of electrons in the dot .",
    "the ratios @xmath177 and @xmath178 have , for n@xmath220 , average values 1.68 and 1.37 respectively , instead of 3 and 2 as corresponds to the harmonic oscillator sequence .",
    "it is apparent from that figure the n - dependence of @xmath179 .",
    "as we have already discussed , only for the dipole mode in the case of a parabolic confining potential one has @xmath180 .",
    "the deviation from that rule becomes more and more important as the number of electrons in the dot increases .",
    "this has been already discussed in ref .",
    "the n - dependence of @xmath181 is more complex , and it is due to the interplay between kinetic and coulomb energy contributions to the excitation energy . it can be easily understood from eq .",
    "( [ eq53 ] ) , which shows that the contribution of the kinetic energy term is important for small n and increases with increasing l. for fixed l , the coulomb energy eventually dominates , and @xmath181 depends on n in a way similar to the dipole mode .",
    "finally , we have also studied the collective spectrum of the n=6 dot in the parabolic potential with @xmath173=5.6 mev , and have found that as expected , the @xmath181 energies at b=0 depend on n. for example , @xmath182 decreases from 8.2 to 7.5 mev , @xmath183 decreases from 10.9 to 9.0 mev , and @xmath184 decreases from 14.3 to 10.4 mev when one goes from n=6 to n=56 .",
    "so far , we have presented a systematic study carried out under well defined conditions which could render it difficult the comparison with the results of a given experiment , since there are several variables that have to be fixed at the experimental values to permit a sensible comparison . to end this section , we want to compare some results obtained within our formalism with the experimental data of ref .",
    "this is possible only in part because in that work , the l=1 and 2 well defined branches have been obtained for a dot made of a large number of electrons , n=210 . at present , this is too large a value for us to deal with microscopically . let us remind that the s.p .",
    "wave functions behave near the origin as r@xmath185 ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and since the s.p .",
    "levels are nondegenerate when b@xmath500 , large n s imply large s.p .",
    "angular momenta .",

    "it can be inferred from the value of the dipole energy demel et al .",
    "find at b=0 , that n@xmath186 28 .",
    "for this dot , the ratio @xmath178 they obtain is around 2 , a value we are unable to reproduce , whereas for the n=210 dot it is @xmath1621.5 , in better agreement with our systematics .",
    "nevertheless , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] that @xmath171 and e@xmath55(q@xmath54 ) nicely reproduce the positive b - dispersion branch , which is the only one for which a detailed comparison is possible .",
    "in this work we have used a variational approach similar to the one proposed by feynmann in the case of liquid @xmath46he , to describe the multipole spectrum of quantum dots .",
    "one of the merits of the method is that quantum and finite size effects can be taken into account .",
    "it may be easily applied to dots hosting several tens of electrons . rather than in the method itself , this limitation has its origin in technical difficulties inherent to current microscopic approaches to handle a large number of electrons in intense magnetic fields .",
    "we have presented a systematic description of edge modes up to l=4 in the region of interest to describe level crossing at non zero magnetic fields .",
