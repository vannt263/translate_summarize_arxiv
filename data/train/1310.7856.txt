    "<S> the feasibility of obtaining exact analytical results in the realm of qed in the presence of a background electromagnetic field is almost exclusively limited to a few tractable cases , where the dirac equation in the corresponding background field can be solved analytically . </S>",

    "<S> , we construct analytically single - particle electron states in the presence of a background electromagnetic field of general space - time structure in the realistic assumption that the initial energy of the electron is the largest dynamical energy scale in the problem . </S>",

    "<S> the predictions of qed have been confirmed with outstanding precision in numerous experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the impressive agreement between the theoretical and the experimental value of the electron @xmath0-factor is customarily quoted as a prominent example @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the experimental scrutiny of qed becomes much less thorough when processes are involved , occurring in the presence of a strong background electromagnetic field , i.e. of the order of @xmath1 ( here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electron mass and charge , respectively ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason is that these values largely exceed the field strengths available in laboratories . an important exception is represented by the electric field of highly - charged ions ( charge number @xmath4 , with @xmath5 ) at the typical qed length @xmath6 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> indeed , numerous experiments on processes occurring in the presence of highly - charged ions @xcite have already successfully confirmed the predictions of qed . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , advanced analytical methods @xcite , have been developed to interpret accurate experimental data beyond the exactly - solvable coulomb model of the ionic field .    </S>",
    "<S> modern high - power lasers represent an alternative source of intense electromagnetic fields structurally thoroughly different from atomic fields . </S>",
    "<S> although the amplitude @xmath7 of the strongest laser pulse ever produced is about @xmath8 @xcite , it can be boosted to an effective strength @xmath9 in the rest - frame of ultrarelativistic particles colliding with the laser beam @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this principle has been exploited at slac to perform the so - far unique experimental campaign on strong - laser field qed @xcite , employing a laser with photon energy @xmath10 and amplitude @xmath11 , and an almost counter - propagating electron beam with energy of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively large pulse spot area ( @xmath14 ) allowed for the experimental results being well reproduced theoretically within the plane - wave field approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> approximating the laser field as a plane wave allows one to solve exactly the dirac equation in the resulting background electromagnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding electron single - particle states ( volkov states ) have been extensively employed to investigate different strong - field qed processes @xcite ( see also the recent reviews @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , particle in cell ( pic ) codes including strong - field qed effects @xcite in the dynamics of laser - irradiated plasmas employ expressions of the qed rates calculated in the plane - wave ( local - constant - crossed - field ) approximation . </S>",
    "<S> however , no analytical calculations in strong - field qed have been performed so far , which also include self - consistently the spatial focusing of the laser beam . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially desirable as ultra - high intensities are attained nowadays by spatially focusing the laser energy almost down to the diffraction limit .    in the present letter </S>",
    "<S> we determine analytically the electron single - particle states in the presence of a strong background electromagnetic field of general space - time structure in the experimentally relevant case of an ultrarelativistic electron . </S>",
    "<S> in the realistic assumption that the initial energy of the electron is the largest dynamical energy scale in the problem , we first determine the classical worldline of the electron and then we construct the corresponding quantum states in the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) or eikonal approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the availability of such single - particle states and , in particular , their relatively compact expression open the possibility of investigating analytically and in a systematic way strong - field qed processes in the presence of intense background fields with complex space - time structure as , e.g. , those of tightly - focused laser beams .    to date </S>",
    "<S> , two methods have been developed to investigate qed processes in the presence of a virtually arbitrary background electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> however , the first one , based on the quasiclassical operator technique @xcite , allows one to obtain results only at the leading order in the quasiclassical , ultrarelativistic limit and does not contain a general prescription on how to calculate neither the amplitude of a generic qed process nor high - order corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the second one , instead , employs the so - called `` trajectory - coherent - states '' ( tcs ) @xcite , which are relativistic electron wave - functions localized near the classical electron s trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> however , the expression of the tcs is extremely cumbersome and of limited use for practical calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the classical problem of an ultrarelativistic electron moving in a background electromagnetic field , described by the four - vector potential @xmath15 in the lorentz gauge @xmath16 ( here and below , units with @xmath17 are employed ) . </S>",
    "<S> we work in the laboratory frame where the electron initial four - momentum is @xmath18 and we have in mind the case where the background electromagnetic field represents an intense , short , and tightly focused laser beam . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we also assume that the field tensor @xmath19 is localized in space and time , that it has a maximum amplitude @xmath7 , and that it is characterized by a typical angular frequency @xmath20 , such that the classical nonlinearity parameter @xmath21 ( see @xcite for a manifestly covariant and gauge - invariant definition of the parameter @xmath22 ( see also @xcite ) ) satisfies the strong inequalities : @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the above assumptions well fit present and near - future experimental conditions envisaged to test strong - field qed with intense lasers . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , even next - generation of @xmath24 ti : sa lasers @xcite ( central wavelength @xmath25 ) are realistically expected not to exceed a peak intensity of @xmath26 , corresponding to @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> such a field amplitude is effectively boosted to the critical value @xmath30 in the rest frame of an electron with an energy of @xmath31 , which is about six times @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , electron beams with energies of about @xmath33 have been already demonstrated experimentally also with laser - plasma accelerators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is the lorentz equation : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the electron four - momentum and @xmath36 is its proper time . according to the analytical solution of the lorentz equation in a plane - wave @xcite , the condition @xmath37 in the laboratory frame ensures that the electron will be only slightly deflected from its initial direction by the background field in the physically relevant situation where it is initially counterpropagating with respect to the laser field . </S>",
    "<S> thus , rather than working with manifestly covariant equations it is convenient to introduce the light - cone coordinates @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , and the quantities @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , with @xmath45 ( in this respect , see also @xcite , where vacuum qed has been formulated by employing light - cone coordinates in the so - called `` infinite - momentum frame '' ) . </S>",
