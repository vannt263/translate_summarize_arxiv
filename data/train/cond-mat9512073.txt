    "while originally predicted to appear in clean one - dimensional metallic rings @xcite , most of the recent discussion about persistent currents has focused on metallic rings containing impurities @xcite .",
    "static magnetic properties of small rings and dots were studied by several authors@xcite . an important step in the understanding of magnetization of mesoscopic quantum rings was taking into account the difference between canonical and grand canonical ensembles@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the magnetization of isolated rings with fixed number of particles is much larger than of the ensemble of rings kept under fixed chemical potential . as a result",
    ", the main contribution to the magnetic moment has been expressed in terms of the fluctuation of the number of particles at fixed chemical potential , @xmath0 .",

    "the probability @xmath8 is given by the expression@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the probability density . here",

    ", one has to replace the system under consideration by @xmath44 systems identical to the original one and at the end tend @xmath45 .",
    "usually , after such a procedure one arrives at relatively simple expressions .",
    "the limiting transition @xmath46 ( if done properly ) automatically cancels out the non - physical contributions that has to be done explicitly within the supersymmetric approach .    to take the full advantage of this property one needs a regular procedure to calculate the limit @xmath45 .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to suggest a procedure of analytical continuation of a non - perturbative two - particle green s function from integer @xmath44 to the whole complex plane which includes the point @xmath47 .",
    "such a procedure allows one to calculate the limit rather automatically excluding necessity of direct cancelation of non - physical contributions .",
