    "the problem is posed for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , and we give initial conditions @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a nonnegative and integrable function in @xmath13 with compact support or fast decay at infinity . motivation and related ideas for such a problem are given in @xcite , where the existence of a weak solution is established for a suitable class of initial data that includes all functions @xmath12 with the above properties .",
    "besides , a number of the most important properties is proved , like the energy estimates , the bounds in the @xmath14 spaces and the property of finite propagation that says that compactly supported data produce solutions whose support is compact for all positive times . however , the uniqueness of weak solutions is a pending open problem but for the case of one space dimension , @xcite .",

    "<S> we establish the large - time behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> we first find selfsimilar nonnegative solutions by solving an elliptic obstacle problem with fractional laplacian for the pair pressure - density , which we call obstacle barenblatt solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the theory for elliptic fractional problems with obstacles has been recently established . </S>",
    "<S> we then use entropy methods to show that the asymptotic behavior of general finite - mass solutions is described after renormalization by these special solutions , which represent a surprising variation of the barenblatt profiles of the standard porous medium model . </S>"
