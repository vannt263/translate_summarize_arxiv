    "temperature relaxation rates between electrons and ions is one of many quantities that must be modeled accurately in order to predict inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) @xcite .",
    "the lack of equilibrium in icf occurs because the fusion alpha particles deposit their energy collisionally to the electrons and ions at different rates depending on the temperature regime @xcite .",
    "the task is challenging because icf plasmas traverse complex physics regimes characterized by collective , quantum and correlation effects . in practice",
    ", there have been attempts to splice models from the different regimes @xcite but they are ad - hoc and not validated to the required accuracy .",
    "recently , direct many - body simulations @xcite have been undertaken to validate the various models of relaxation rates .    since the seminal works of landau and spitzer on weakly coupled plasmas @xcite , a variety of developments has been made to calculate the temperature relaxation rates in plasmas .",
    "the best established , parameter - free models have considered either weakly coupled , non - degenerate ( ideal ) plasmas ( e.g. @xcite ) or include degeneracy effects in the limit of weak electron - ion interactions @xcite . in spite of recent works @xcite , the effect of particle correlations on the electron - ion energy exchanges in non - ideal plasmas is still not definitely understood    in this paper , we present a model for the e - i temperature relaxation rates in plasmas that includes _ self - consistently _ the effects of screening , electron degeneracy and correlations between electrons and ions . the model resolves the close and distant particle encounters in a self - consistent fashion and does not involve ad - hoc cutoffs .",
    "we validate the model against molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulations of classical plasmas over a wide range of plasma coupling .",
    "we then apply the model to dense hydrogen and discuss the relative importance of degeneracy and correlation effects to the relaxation rate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is presented in section [ section2 ] .",
    "our derivation intentionally focusses on the temporal evolution of the _ ionic _ temperature @xmath0 in a two - temperature plasma .",
    "taking advantage that ions are classical , an equation of evolution for @xmath0 is obtained from momentum integration of the exact kinetic equation for the ionic phase - space distribution function .",
    "the equation obtained ( eq.([generaldtdt ] ) below ) expresses the change in @xmath0 in terms of the net work done by the electrons on the ions .",
    "the latter can be obtained from the ionic and electronic density fluctuations in the plasma .",
    "we thus propose a model for the density fluctuations that includes self - consistently the effects of screening , electron degeneracy and correlations between electrons and ions .",
    "using this model , the equation for the ionic temperature becomes a simple rate equation , @xmath1 where the temperature relaxation rate @xmath2 has the landau - spitzer form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a `` universal '' rate and @xmath5 is the generalized coulomb logarithm that carries the many - body effects taking place in the plasma .",
    "the model reduces to well - known approximations in the appropriate limits ( e.g. landau - spitzer formula , fermi - golden rule formula , lenard - balescu formula . )",
    "several technical details of the derivation of the model are presented in the appendices .    in section [ section3 ]",
    "we proceed to validate the predictions of the model by comparing them with results of md simulations . because first - principles simulations of real non - equilibrium plasmas are not feasible yet , the validation upon truly ab - initio calculations is not possible .",
    "an approximation used by several authors to cope with this consists in performing md simulations of plasmas with semi - classical potentials that mimic quantum effects in an approximative way and prevent the unphysical collapse undergone by classical electron - ion systems @xcite .",
    "however such semiclassical md calculations are no longer fully ab - initio ; besides their adequacy to simulate temperature relaxation is not unquestionably established .",
    "the only truly ab - initio simulations of plasmas that can be performed are for like - charged systems made of positively charged electrons and ions immersed in an inert , neutralizing background .",
    "highly accurate md simulations of the relaxation rate in like - charged plasmas are possible and were recently reported in @xcite .",
    "we therefore apply our model to a plasma of like - charged electrons and ions .",
    "this is legimate since our formalism is independent of the nature of the electrons .",
    "electrons can be quantum and negatively charged as in a real plasma but can also be classical and positively charged : it is only when one evaluates the model that quantities pertaining to the system studied must be used ( e.g. classical vs quantum response functions . )",
    "as we shall see , like - charged systems are as challenging as real plasmas for the theory because , contrary to the latter , they exhibits correlation effects in all regimes of plasma coupling .",
    "they therefore provide a good test of the validity of a theory that aims to include correlation and strong coupling effects .",
    "moreover , the points of differences between like - charged and real plasmas make the comparison very instructive to shed lights on correlation effects . for classical like - charged plasmas",
    ", our model reproduces the accurate md data and joins the weakly to strongly coupled regimes .",
    "in section [ section4 ] , we apply the model to real dense hydrogen plasmas .",
    "we shall see that , while e - i correlation effects are crucial in classical plasmas at any density and temperature , quantum diffraction effects prevail over e - i correlation effects in real , dense plasmas .",
    "finally , we present in appendix [ comparison ] a systematic comparison of our model with the coupled - mode theory of dharma - wardana and perrot @xcite , the fermi - golden rule result @xcite and with the lenard - balescu formula @xcite .    in the following , the fourier transform of a space- and time - dependent function @xmath6",
    "is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the volume .",
    "we consider a spatially uniform , un - magnetized , two - temperature plasma consisting of one species of ions ( mass @xmath9 , number density @xmath10 , charge @xmath11 , temperature @xmath0 ) and free electrons ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) in a volume @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that , at any time @xmath16 , the electronic ( e ) and ionic ( i ) components of the plasma each may be characterized by a temperature @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . because of the large difference between @xmath12 and @xmath9 , it is indeed reasonable to assume that the energy exchange between electrons and ions occurs on a time scale that is much larger that the equilibration times @xmath19 within each subsystem @xmath20 .",
    "the ( classical ) ion dynamics can be completely described by the kinetic equation for the single - particle distribution function @xmath21 in the phase space consisting of the position @xmath22 and momentum @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 equation ( [ kineticequation ] ) is readily obtained as the ensemble average @xmath25 of the evolution equation for the microscopic ( klimontovich ) distribution function @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the position and momentum of the @xmath28-th ion at time @xmath16 .",
    "since we are looking at time - scales larger than the equilibration times @xmath29 within each subsystem , @xmath25 denotes an average not only over microscopic replica of the same macroscopic state but also over a time scale of order @xmath30 ; the notation @xmath31 denotes the fluctuations of a quantity @xmath32 around its average , i.e. @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in eq.([kineticequation ] ) @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the fluctuating part of the total force acting on the ions that is induced by the density fluctuations @xmath37 in the electronic and ionic systems .    the ionic temperature at time @xmath16 is given by , @xmath38 using eqs.([kineticequation ] ) and ( [ ionictemperature ] )",
    ", we obtain the equation of evolution for @xmath0 , @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the fluctuating part of the ionic current density @xmath41 . without magnetic fields , @xmath42 is longitudinal and is related to @xmath43 through the continuity equation : @xmath44 ; in fourier representation , @xmath45 .",
    "the term @xmath46 is the force induced by the electronic density fluctuations @xmath47 ; in fourier representation , @xmath48 where the e - i interaction potential is @xmath49 @xcite . according to eq.([generaldtdt ] ) , the evolution of the ionic temperature @xmath0 is determined by the statistically averaged work done on the ions by the fluctuating force @xmath50 exerted by the electrons    introducing the expressions for @xmath51 and @xmath52 in eq.([generaldtdt ] ) , we obtain @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the imaginary part .",
    "we remark here that when the system is at equilibrium , @xmath55 , the right - hand side of eq.([generaldtdt2 ] ) vanishes as it should .",
    "indeed , it follows from time - invariance that at equilibrium @xmath56 is real and equal to @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the e - i dynamic structure factor @xcite .    according to eq.([generaldtdt2 ] ) , an equation for @xmath59 can be obtained by modeling the density fluctuations in the two - temperature plasma , which we proceed to do as follows .",
    "following ichimaru @xcite , the fluctuations @xmath60 can generally be split into two parts , @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 represents the spontaneous fluctuations due to the discrete nature of the particles and that are present even in the absence of interactions , @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the particle position and momentum at some initial time @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 describes the fluctuations that are induced by the interactions between the particles . upon momentum integration of eq.([sponatneousfluctuations ] ) , a similar splitting holds for the electronic and ionic density fluctuations , namely @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the spontaneous fluctuations in the particle density of species @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the density fluctuations that develop due to e - e , e - i and i - i interactions .",
    "we shall assume that the fluctuations are small quantities , i.e. @xmath72 .",
    "this is a very reasonable assumption since each subsystem @xmath70 is supposed to be in `` internal '' equilibrium at temperature @xmath73 , and the plasma is supposed to be uniform .",
    "accordingly , we extend the results of equilibrium linear response theory to a two - temperature system and express the density fluctuations ( [ densityfluctuations0 ] ) as @xcite @xmath74 in eq.([densityfluctuations ] ) , @xmath75 is the local effective potential seen by a particle of species @xmath70 due to the density fluctuations @xmath76 , so that the product @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the free - particle response function of species @xmath70 , the density fluctuations resulting from the interactions of particles of species @xmath70 with those of species @xmath79 .",
    "when @xmath80 , eq.([densityfluctuations ] ) corresponds to the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , also known as the vlasov or mean - field approximation in plasma physics . in this approximation ,",
    "the effective field seen by an electron or an ion in the plasma is the field that would be seen by a classical , external test charge embedded in the plasma .",
    "this approximation fails to account for the correlations that exist between the particle under scrutiny and all the other particles in the plasma .",
    "for instance , it does not account for the fact that the effective field seen by a particle must not include the contribution from that very same particle .",
    "the so - called local field corrections ( lfc ) @xmath81 in eq.([densityfluctuations ] ) account for the neglect of those correlation ( and exchange ) effects inherent to the rpa approximation .",
    "the model eq.([densityfluctuations ] ) for the density fluctuations is used to calculate the right - hand - side of eq.([generaldtdt ] ) . to this end",
    ", we need the correlation function for the spontaneous density fluctuations , @xmath82 . using eq.([sponatneousfluctuations ] ) and that at @xmath66 the positions of two different `` spontaneous '' particles are uncorrelated , we obtain @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the dynamic structure factor of the ideal gas of species @xmath70 at temperature @xmath73 .",

    "is conveniently rewritten in the landau - spitzer form @xmath99 i.e as the product of a `` universal '' rate @xmath100 and of a ( dimensionless ) generalized coulomb logarithm , @xmath101    our approach , which consists in modeling the density fluctuations in a two - temperature plasma to obtain @xmath102 , does not rely on the concept of isolated binary collisions and allows us to treat the plasma as a single entity and to include self - consistently the electron - ion interactions .",
    "for instance the collective behavior typical of a plasma and in particular the screening of the e - i interaction due to both electrons and ions are present through the dielectric function @xmath103 in eq.([dtdtgeneral2 ] ) .",
    "the short - range correlations , which especially affect the contribution of close encounters , are self - consistently added through the local - field corrections ( see e.g. the factor @xmath104 in the numerator of eqs.([dtdtgeneral2 ] ) and [ modellnl ] . ) the effect of particle statistics , e.g. electron degeneracy , is included through the response functions .",
    "all these effects are not _ ad hoc _ constructs but are self - consistently derived .",

    "here we just make the following remarks .",
    "when only e - i correlations are neglected , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 is approximated by its value in the jellium model @xmath107 , our model reduces to the so - called fermi - golden rule ( fgr ) formula obtained within the framework of linear response theory assuming weak e - i interactions @xcite .",
    "our model can thus be regarded as an extension of the fgr formula where the plasma is treated as a whole and e - i interactions are treated self - consisitently .",
    "when the lfc s are completely neglected , @xmath108 , our model reduces to the result obtained using the lenard - balescu kinetic equations .",
    "finallty , it is worthwhile to remark that the coulomb logarithm ( [ modellnl ] ) differs from the coulomb logarithm entering the ziman formula for the electronic conductivity and its extensions to strongly coupled plasmas @xcite in that the latters involve , in addition to the terms in the integrand of eq.([modellnl ] ) , the static ion - ion structure factor @xmath109 .",
    "thus , contrary to the e - i momentum exchanges that govern the electronic conductivity , e - i energy exchanges are globally insensitive to the details of the ion fluctuation spectrum @xcite ( see discussion in appendix [ appendix1 ] . ) this is reminiscent of bethe s result on stopping power @xcite that the energy loss of a fast charged particle in a plasma is fixed by the total number of scatterers .",

    "we expect that correlations will play a bigger role whenever @xmath220 ( and in turn @xmath221 ) significantly increases while the large momentum cutoff @xmath187 imposed by @xmath182 also increases ; this certainly occurs at densities and temperatures low enough for bound states to emerge and below which our model breaks down @xcite .",
    "in summary , we describe a model for the rate of temperature relaxation between electrons and ions that treats the effects of electron statistics and particle screening and correlations in a self - consistent fashion . such a treatment is necessary in order to calculate the coulomb logarithm without ad - hoc cutoffs and with improved accuracy for the various physics regimes encountered in inertial confinement fusion and stellar interiors .",
    "the key result in our model for the relaxation rate removes the uncertainty in the coulomb logarithm because it resolves the close and distant particle encounters in a self - consistent fashion .",
    "the distant encounters are limited by the plasma dielectric response for boltzmann or fermi statistics as needed .",
    "the close encounters are limited by quantum diffraction effects and short - range particle correlations . by treating these effects together and self - consistently , the coulomb logarithm that we obtain for a low temperature , oppositely - charged plasma is @xmath222 smaller than the often used brysk @xcite result and @xmath222 larger than the fermi golden rule .    in order to validate our model with ab - initio md simulations",
    ", we also applied our fomalism to a plasma of like - charged electrons and ions .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that experiments with real plasmas have not been able to provide data of sufficient accuracy to resolve any of these issues .",
    "the available md simulations can be much more accurate but they are fundamentally classical .",
    "moreover , when the interparticle potential is modified at short distance to include to some degree quantum effects , the simulations are no longer ab - initio .",
    "we thus abandoned the semi - classical approximation and used the real coulomb force in our md simulations , but we had to make the electron and ion charges alike in order to avoid coulomb collapse .",
    "our model is applicable to such a system and our results are in excellent agreement with md simulations .",
    "this is a valid test of our formalism because the extension to a real and quantum plasma is straightforward .    in the future",
    ", we plan to perform md simulations with modfied potentials in order to test the semiclassical approximation for both like and opposite charged plasmas @xcite .",

    "as discussed earlier , both our model and the lb model describe self - consistently the electron - ion interactions in a plasma and therefore the coupled modes at the root of dwp theory .",
    "the lb model describes those modes at the level of the rpa approximation while our model brings in correlation effects . again , because in practice electrons are much faster than ions , @xmath381 , the temperature relaxation rates are insensitive to the mode spectrum and both the lb model and our model reduce to eq.([fgrsmallalpha ] ) .",
    "we suspect that the prescription of dwp , supposedly based on some of the feymann diagrams discussed in @xcite , overestimates ( multiple counts ) the effect of screening .",
    "* unlike our model , the dwp expression ( [ dwp ] ) does not include a term like @xmath135 in the numerator .",
    "as a consequence , when applied to a classical like - charged system , the dwp model _ diverges _ logarithmically at large - k ( the integrand scale like @xmath382 at large @xmath119 as the lb and fgr formulas ) .",
    "the dwp is therefore unable to explain the classical md data discussed in section [ section3 ] , while the concept of coupled - modes at the basis of dwp does not only pertain to real plasmas but also applies to classical like - charged systems . * for dense hydrogen , our model predict rates at most @xmath222 larger than the fgr ,",
    "in contrast with the findings of @xcite mentionned above ."
