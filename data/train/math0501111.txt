    "the concept of grbner bases for polynomial ideals together with the algorithmic characterization of these bases in terms of @xmath0polynomials was invented almost 40 years ago by buchberger in his phd thesis  @xcite . since that time grbner bases have become the most universal algorithmic tool in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry  ( see , for example , books @xcite-@xcite )",
    "moreover , this role of grbner bases was extended to rings of linear differential and shift operators and to some other noncommutative algebras  ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the fundamental property of a grbner basis of a polynomial ideal is the divisibility of any element in the related initial ideal by the leading monomial of an element in the basis . in our paper",
    "@xcite an algorithmic approach was developed based on an axiomatically formulated restriction for the conventional monomial division .",
    "this restricted division which we called involutive generalizes the pioneering results by zharkov and blinkov  @xcite on carrying over the involutive methods from differential equations to commutative algebra and leads to a more general concept of involutive bases .",
    "an involutive basis is a ( generally redundant ) grbner basis .",
    "but for all that , an element in the initial ideal is multiple of the leading term of an element in the involutive basis not only in the conventional sense but also in the involutive sense . just as a monic reduced grbner basis  @xcite , a monic minimal involutive basis  @xcite of an ideal",
    "is uniquely defined for a given monomial order .",
    "an impetus was given to the involutive division technique with the experimental demonstration in  @xcite the efficiency of involutive algorithms as an alternative method to compute grbner bases .",
    "the concepts , ideas and algorithms developed in  @xcite got further development and extension to linear differential algebra and noncommutative rings in our papers  @xcite-@xcite and in the papers of other authors  @xcite-@xcite .    with all this going on , the involutive algorithms have been implemented for particular involutive divisions in reduce  @xcite , mathematica  @xcite , maple  @xcite , mupad  @xcite , c / c++  @xcite and recently in singular ( version 2.0.5 ) .",
    "having analyzed our paper  @xcite , apel  @xcite introduced a slightly different concept of involutive division and designed another form of involutive algorithms based on his concept .",
    "the approach of apel was further elaborated by himself and hemmecke  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "differences of both approaches  @xcite and  @xcite and some unifying aspects were studied in  @xcite .    for a given finite polynomial set , an involutive division partitions the variables into two disjoint subsets called multiplicative and non - multiplicative .",
    "the construction of an involutive basis is often called completion to involution and consists in examining the involutive reducibility of non - multiplicative prolongations , i.e. , products of the polynomials and their non - multiplicative variables . in doing so",
    ", the involutive algorithms also examine all essential @xmath0polynomials  @xcite but with rather special reductions based on involutive division .",
    "thereby , there is no conceptual distinction between buchberger algorithm and involutive algorithms .",
    "the difference is in both critical pairs selection and their reduction provided with the presence of extra polynomials at involutive completion which are redundant in the conventional sense .",
    "computer experiments with our c / c++ code  @xcite implementing the involutive algorithm for janet division and with the standard benchmarks  @xcite show that in the most cases our code is faster than the most optimized modern - day implementations of buchberger s",
    "algorithm  .",
    "thus the involutive algorithm may be considered as an improvement of buchberger s algorithm .    in the present paper",
    "we follow the concept of involutive division in paper  @xcite , which is briefly described in sect.3 as a particular case of the restricted monomial division introduced in sect.2 , and present our involutive algorithm in its detailed and optimized form ( sect.4 ) .",
    "the algorithm can also be used to output the reduced grbner bases of polynomial ideals without extra reduction of the computed involutive basis .",
    "some aspects of computational efficiency of the involutive algorithm are considered in sect.5 .",
    "it is easy to rewrite the algorithm for linear differential polynomial ideals and for ideals in rings of noncommutative polynomials with algebra of solvable type .",
    "besides , the algorithm admits a straightforward extension to modules in these rings .",

    "and the left child of a node has always a higher second index ( degree in the current variable ) than its parent .",
    "0.3 cm    0.3 cm given a monomial @xmath324 @xmath325 , we start in our search for a janet divisor in @xmath126 from the root . if @xmath326 we select @xmath189 as the current variable with number 1 , and compare @xmath327 with the second index in the left child of the root ( 1 in our case ) .    if @xmath328 we move to the child , and there is no further way to the left since the left child of our current node has degree ( second index ) 3 in the current variable @xmath189 .",
    "hence , the leaf monomials of the lest subtree can not divide @xmath17 .",
    "thus , we have to look at the right child of our current node . if it exists , as in our case , we select the second variable @xmath304 as the current one",
    ". then we compare @xmath329 with the second index ( degree in @xmath304 and 0 in our case ) of the right child . if @xmath330 we move to the right child .",
    "since in our case the current node does not have left child , we change the current variable to @xmath323 and compare @xmath331 with the degree in @xmath323 of the left child which is a leaf .",
    "if @xmath332 we go to the leaf and this means that the leaf monomial ( @xmath333 in our case ) is a janet divisor we are looking for .",
    "therefore for a monomial of the form @xmath334 with @xmath335 janet divisor is @xmath333 .",
    "if @xmath336 we can not move to the left , since for the current variable @xmath189 the second index of the left child is @xmath337 , and the leaf monomials in the left subtree ( in our case the only monomial @xmath338 ) can not contain janet divisor of @xmath17 . therefore , a monomial of the form @xmath339 has no janet divisor in the tree .",
    "if @xmath340 we go to the left child and then proceed with the next variable @xmath304 , as the current one , by comparing @xmath329 with the degree in @xmath304 of the right child .",
    "it is leaf and has degree 1 .",
    "it follows that @xmath338 is a janet divisor for @xmath17 with @xmath341 whereas for @xmath342 monomial @xmath17 has no janet divisor in @xmath126 .",
    "similarly one can analyze the case @xmath343 when one has to go from the root to the right .",
    "this example illustrates the following general fact  @xcite . for a given monomial ,",
    "a janet tree provides the unique path in the tree which either ends up with the leaf containing the sought divisor or breaks in a certain interior node .",
    "the node is such that its left child , if any , has a higher degree in the current variable and there is no way to the right since the right child has a higher degree ( in the next variable according to the order ) than the given monomial .",
    "algorithm * involutivebasis ii * admits a natural and efficient parallelism .",
    "naturalness is apparent from lines 4 and 19 of the main algorithm and from the structure of subalgorithm * headreduce*. the @xmath35head reduction of polynomials in @xmath155 , that is , the most time - consuming part of the completion procedure can be done in parallel . as to efficiency , in our recent paper",
    "@xcite a slightly modified version of the algorithm oriented to the multi - thread computation was experimentally studied on a two processor pentium iii 700 mhz computer running under gentoo linux .",
    "some of experimental data extracted from those obtained in  @xcite and related to the benchmarks already used above , presented in table 6 .    .timings ( in seconds ) and speedup due to parallelism [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the second and third columns show the timings for the one- and three - thread modes of parallel computation .",
    "the last two columns give absolute and relative speeding - up of the three - thread run in comparison with one - thread .",
    "each of the threads was doing the involutive head reduction .",
    "we experimented with different numbers of treads , and it turned out that the maximal speed - up is achieved just for three threads .",
    "this is in conformity with the well - known observation that for multi - treading on a computer with smp ( symmetric multiprocessing ) architecture an optimal number of threads is the number of processors exceeded by one .",
    "for such a small example as cyclic6 the overheads of multi - threading surpass the computational effect of the parallelization , and we obtain some slowing down . for the other examples in table 6",
    "the speed - up is rather considerable .",
    "the relative speed - up greater than the number of processors can be explained by a better selection strategy dynamically realizable in the multi - thread mode . in this case",
    "some head - reduced prolongations may come into play earlier than in the one - thread mode and cause a faster chain of the successive reductions .    since computational costs for buchberger",
    "s algorithm are highly unstable with respect to the selection strategy for @xmath0polynomials , its experimental parallelization ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) does not reveal a reasonable gain from the parallelism . the involutive algorithm , according to our two - processor experiments , does not have this difficulty and rather stable to variation of the selection strategy .",
    "moreover , if one performs in parallel the @xmath35head reduction , then , as we observed in the three - thread run on the two - processor machine , it may even optimize selection strategy .",
    "at least , for a degree compatible term order , if the normal strategy is used , the parallelization apparently helps to select a prolongation with the smallest total degree of the leading term . as we observed experimentally , in most cases this increases the speed of computation .",
    "certainly , one has to run the algorithm on a machine with more number of processors to investigate its parallelization experimentally .",
    "because of the result of two - processor benchmarking and the intrinsic parallel structure of the algorithm , one can expect its good experimental scalability .",
    "as discussed above , experimental analysis of the described involutive algorithms implemented for janet division shows that they form an efficient computational alternative to buchberger s algorithm for construction of grbner bases .    evidently , there are infinitely many different and algorithmically `` good '' , i.e. noetherian , continuous and constructive , involutive divisions  @xcite satisfying properties in definition 3.1",
    ". however it is still an open question , if there is a better division in theory and/or heuristically better in practice than janet division . in theory",
    ", one can say that division @xmath344 is better than @xmath345 if the inclusion @xmath346 \\label{comp_div}\\ ] ] holds for conventionally autoreduced monomial sets @xmath126 , and there are sets @xmath126 for which the inclusion is strict . in this case , by the same arguments as those used in  @xcite for the correctness proof , one can show that , for an identical selection strategy , algorithm * involutivebasis ii * with division @xmath344 will process never more , but sometimes less number of non - multiplicative prolongations than with division @xmath345 .",
    "in addition , the corresponding output @xmath35bases satisfy @xmath347 with the strict inclusion for some ideals .    in practice , running time depends not only on the number of prolongation treated and on the related size of the intermediate and final basis . apart from other implementation aspects , running time depends also on costs of such frequently used and depending on the involutive division operations as re - computation of multiplicative and",
    "non - multiplicative variables under change of the intermediate polynomial set and search for involutive divisors .",
    "however , it is fairly advisable to prefer ( for implementation too ) divisions which generate less number of non - multiplicative variables .    to illustrate the last statement , confront pommaret and janet divisions for zero - dimensional ideals when pommaret bases always exist . in such a case at first glance pommaret division ( example 3.2 )",
    "is favoured over janet one ( example 3.1 ) .",
    "indeed , it does not require re - computing separation of variables for elements in the intermediate basis if other elements are added or removed .",
    "besides , pommaret division admits trees for searching involutive divisors that are very similar to janet trees , and the search in a pommaret tree is as fast as in the janet tree with the same leaves .",
    "nevertheless , as implemented in the form of algorithm * involutivebasis ii * , pommaret division compares unfavourably with janet division .",
    "we experimented with both divisions while creating the c code presented in  @xcite , and for all the benchmarks used pommaret division lost in speed to janet division .",
    "the reason is that janet division surpasses pommaret division in accordance to ( [ comp_div ] ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "table 1 gives an example of the strict inclusion . to provide existence of the related pommaret basis ,",
    "@xmath126 can be considered as the leading monomial set for zero - dimensional ideal , for instance , @xmath348 .",
    "since , as shown in  @xcite , whenever pommaret basis exists it coincides with ( minimal ) janet basis , algorithm * involutivebasis ii * for janet division produces the same output as for pommaret division but with processing less number of prolongations .    for the time being we do not know involutive divisions better in theory and/or heuristically in practice than janet division . in the approach of apel  @xcite involutive division",
    "is defined locally in terms of ( admissible for ) a monomial set as satisfying properties 1 and 2 in definition 3.1 and not necessarily property 3 . in this approach ,",
    "given a monomial set @xmath126 , one can always construct a division which surpasses janet division for @xmath126 in the sense of relation ( [ comp_div ] ) and often the strict inclusion holds  @xcite .",
    "based on this ( local ) concept of involutive division , apel designed an algorithm for completion to involution with dynamical construction of the best involutive division for every intermediate basis .",
    "this , theoretically very attractive , algorithmic procedure , is unlikely practical because of high computational costs of constructing the best intermediate divisions .",
    "a step forward to practicality of this approach was made by hemmecke in the form of the sliceddivision algorithm implemented in aldor  @xcite .",
    "though this algorithm is far from being competitive in efficiency with algorithm * involutivebasis ii * , the both approaches to theory of involutive division are complementary  @xcite and their further development mutually helpful .",
    "one should also say that algorithm * involutivebasis ii * is apparently much less efficient than the fastest modern - day algorithms designed by faugre : @xmath349  @xcite recently built - in magma ( version 2 - 11 ) and @xmath350  @xcite .",
    "these two algorithms are based on entirely different completion strategy and exploit the linear algebra methods for polynomial reduction rather than elementary reduction chains used by buchberger s algorithm and the involutive algorithm .",
    "we have good reason to think that the algorithmic ideas of faugre can be incorporated into the involutive methods too .",
