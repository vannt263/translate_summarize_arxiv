    "soft solids obtained from suspensions of attractive colloidal particles are of central relevance in fields ranging from food processing to the design of new smart materials @xcite . in most cases of practical interest these solids are not crystalline but gels or soft glasses @xcite : they arise from the structural arrest of the suspension into a disordered state , in which the particles can support external stress and therefore behave macroscopically like a solid .",
    "the mechanical and rheological properties of this soft matter depend crucially on its structural features which , in turn , are the result of a delicate interplay between the underlying thermodynamics and the arrest conditions . hence , the understanding of the mechanisms leading to structural arrest is decisive for many technological applications in which colloidal suspensions are involved . whereas it is clear that in dense suspensions the crowding of the particles is the main mechanism leading to structural arrest and yielding , suspensions of attractive colloids allow to form soft solids also at low volume fractions , where aggregation produces large scale structures @xcite . at intermediate volume fractions ( say above @xmath0-@xmath1 depending on the specific system ) possible scenarios for the arrest are the crowding of the aggregates acting as the new units of a dense glassy system @xcite , or the geometrically frustrated arrangements of locally stable large scale structures ( such as lamellae or mesoscopic elongated aggregates ) @xcite . at sufficiently low volume fractions , instead , the structure of the arrested states ,",
    "although created via reversible aggregation , resembles more the open fractal networks typically created by diffusion - limited aggregation processes @xcite .",
    "in this situation , where the arrest seems to be intimately related to the network structure , the understanding of the arrest phenomenon is far from being reached .",
    "our work addresses this last situation , which has received only a limited attention in past theoretical and numerical studies .",
    "although experiments show that reversible aggregation processes lead to the formation of open , persistent network structures , most of the established models for the attractive effective interactions , very successful for many aspects @xcite , fail to produce at these low volume fractions network structures that are stable against macro- or micro - phase separation .",
    "confocal microscopy images obtained in recent experiments @xcite demonstrate that the gel networks formed at low volume fractions have a distribution of the particle coordination number @xmath2 that is strongly peaked around @xmath3 , suggesting that the effective interactions include also many - body terms .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "in these systems there are several possible sources for such anisotropies , since the particle surface may not be smooth or the building blocks of the gel are not the primary particles but larger aggregates of irregular shape @xcite . because , up to now , there is no possible quantitative , microscopic derivation of effective interaction which accounts for these complications , we have recently proposed a phenomenological model containing the relevant qualitative ingredients .",
    "following up the idea that directional terms in the effective interactions can lead to the formation of an open network that is thermodynamically stable , our phenomenological model for the effective interactions contains a directional term which introduces a local rigidity @xcite .",
    "our aim is not to reproduce one specific experimental system but to understand how this type of effective interaction might be relevant for the gelation phenomena as observed in diluted suspensions of attractive colloidal particles .    in our model , without imposing a maximal local connectivity @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "the network structure arises from the balance between the internal energy and the entropy , depending on temperature and volume fraction . in a first study",
    "we have shown @xcite that the formation of the persistent network produces the coexistence , in the gel , of very different relaxation processes at different length scales : the relaxation at high wave vectors is due to the fast cooperative motion of pieces of the gel structure ( e.g. the chains connecting two nodes ) , whereas at low wave vectors the overall rearrangements of the heterogeneous gel make the system relax via a stretched exponential decay of the time correlators .",
    "the coexistence of such diverse relaxation mechanisms is characterized by a typical crossover length which is of the order of the network mesh size @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a systematic molecular dynamics study of the model for different temperatures and volume fractions .",
    "we will argue that the structural and dynamical features of this model should be quite general and could be relevant to different experimental gel - forming systems . in section [ model ]",
    "we give the details of the model and of the numerical simulations .",
    "the structure of the system is analyzed in section [ structure ] and in section [ dynamics ] we study the dynamics .",
    "all the results are gathered into a coherent picture in section [ conclu ] .",
    "we consider identical particles of radius @xmath4 , interacting via a potential @xmath5 .",
    "as mentioned above we seek a phenomenological model for the effective interactions which can lead to gelation in attractive colloidal suspensions at low volume fractions .",
    "for this , for the inter - particle attraction we consider a lennard - jones - like potential of the form @xmath6 , producing a narrow attractive well ( @xmath7 is the distance between the centers of particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) . to introduce directionality ,",
    "we have considered an additional soft - sphere repulsion modulated by a geometric term , which reduces the attractive well of @xmath10 unless particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 are in specific relative configurations . to define such configurations the particles",
    "are decorated with _",
    "sticky _ points occupying the vertices of the icosahedron inscribed in the sphere of diameter @xmath4 and centered in the particle position ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "( in units of @xmath11 ) . any other configuration corresponds to an internal energy per particle of @xmath12 .",
    "2 ) the angle @xmath13 among @xmath14 neighboring particle is unlikely to be smaller than @xmath15 degrees . ]    between particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 the directional effect is then obtained in the following way : @xmath16 \\nonumber \\\\ & &   + \\left[\\sum_{p ' } \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1 + f({\\bf{r}}_{j}-{\\bf{r}}_{ip ' } ) } \\right)- 11 \\right ]    \\bigg\\}. \\label{ico}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath17 is the position of @xmath8 , @xmath18 gives the position of the point @xmath19 on particle @xmath8 .",
    "the sum runs over the @xmath20 points of respectively @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath21 so that , if there is one of these points whose distance from the center of particle @xmath8 is small compared to @xmath22 , @xmath23 and the additional soft sphere repulsion does not contribute .",
    "if this distance is larger , then @xmath24 , reducing the depth of the original attractive well to @xmath25 .",
    "as a consequence , two bonded particles will be subjected to the full attraction @xmath26 only if they touch in those specific configurations and a reduced attraction otherwise .",
    "the choice of @xmath20 points allows us to define such relative configurations without imposing a local maximum connectivity to the particles : for example , the choice of @xmath14 or @xmath27 points would anyway lead to the formation of an open network interfering with the effect of directionality which is more appropriate for the physics of these systems .",
    "the term @xmath28 alone is not able to effectively limit the functionality of the particles at the volume fraction and temperatures considered here @xcite and will lead to a gel network whose structure and dynamics are strongly affected by phase separation kinetics .",
    "therefore , in our effective interactions we consider a third term which imposes a certain angular rigidity to the bonds @xmath29 and @xmath30 : @xmath31^{2 } } \\label{v2}\\ ] ] making that the angle among the three neighbor particles is unlikely to be smaller than a certain value @xmath13 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting interaction potential is @xmath32 the choice of including both the terms @xmath33 and @xmath34 has been made in the spirit of investigating more deeply their relative contribution to the formation of the open network ( and to its dynamics ) , at a stage where the presence itself of any directional effect was questioned in the scientific community and therefore not considered in most of the cases .",
    "our investigation of the different role of the two terms , albeit partial , indicates that a simplified version of the model with only @xmath35 should lead to very similar structural and dynamical features @xcite .",
    "we have implemented @xmath5 in a constrained molecular dynamics code to perform micro - canonical simulations , using a suitable combination of the algorithms rattle and shake  @xcite .",
    "although the model may seem quite complicate , in the following sections it will be shown how it undoubtedly picks relevant aspects of the physics it was meant to describe and it does contribute to its understanding .    in eqs.[ico]-[eq1 ] , the parameters @xmath36 , @xmath4 , @xmath37 , @xmath22 and @xmath13 can be used to tune the effective interactions thus giving rise to a large variety of interesting possibilities ( e.g. varying the connectivity from chains to compact structures , changing the local rigidity of the network ... ) .",
    "however the desired features of the persistent structure do not correspond to a very specific combination of the parameters , but to reasonable ranges of values which allow for extensive investigations .",
    "in particular , we have selected the ranges which allow to give rise to the desired features , like a relatively narrow attractive well , a connectivity greater than @xmath38 and a certain angular rigidity .",
    "here we consider one reasonable choice which guarantees the formation of a persistent open network , i.e. @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we have already shown that with these parameters at a volume fraction @xmath44 , the static structure of this system at low temperature is an open network structure @xcite , in qualitative agreement with the one of colloidal gels .",
    "furthermore the system does not show any sign of phase separation in the temperature range investigated and its relaxation time increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath45 , i.e. the static and dynamic properties of the system are indeed very similar to the ones found in real colloidal gels  @xcite .    in the following sections we will discuss the results of molecular dynamics simulations in the micro - canonical ensemble , using a time step of @xmath46 .",
    "the unit of time is @xmath47 , with @xmath48 the mass of a particle .",
    "all the data refers to simulations performed with 8000 particles in cubic boxes of size @xmath49 in unit of @xmath4 , corresponding respectively to particle densities of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 from which we have estimated approximately a volume fraction @xmath53 , @xmath52 , and @xmath54 . for every value of @xmath55",
    "we have studied the system at the temperatures 1.0 , 0.7 , 0.5 , 0.3 , 0.2 , 0.15 , 0.1 , 0.09 , 0.08 , 0.06 , 0.055 , and 0.05 . in order to do this",
    "we have performed the following equilibration protocol : starting from initial high temperature random configurations , the system is equilibrated at each temperature by replacing all the velocities of the center of mass of the particles and the angular velocities with values extracted from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution every @xmath56 time steps ( @xmath56 is suitably varied with temperature from @xmath0 to @xmath57 md steps ) .",
    "we have checked that after equilibration the energy is constant , showing no significant drift over the simulation time window .",
    "we have monitored independently translational and rotational contributions to kinetic energy .",
    "finally , we have verified that different one- and two- time autocorrelation functions reach the equilibrium behavior , i.e. do not age .    from these equilibrated configurations",
    "we start the data production .",
    "the equilibration time grows accordingly to the relaxation time in the system . at the lowest temperatures the equilibration procedure required up to @xmath58 md steps .",
    "for each temperature and volume fraction we generated five independent runs , over which the results presented here have been averaged .",
    "we investigate the structural changes in the system at the different temperatures by means of a comparative study of the density fluctuations , of the local connectivity and of the aggregation process .",
    "after equilibrating the system at different temperatures , we calculate the static structure factor : @xmath59 where the values of the modulus of the wave vector @xmath60 considered are the ones compatible with the periodic boundary conditions of the simulations box .     at volume fraction @xmath61 ( a ) and @xmath62 ( b ) . in each plot , from bottom to top ( at low q ) , @xmath63 .",

    "the dashed line indicates the dependence @xmath64 . ]",
    "[ str1 ]    in fig .  2 , we plot @xmath65 as a function of @xmath60 for different temperatures , at the volume fractions @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the plots show that , upon lowering the temperature , major structural changes occur due to aggregation , as indicated by the peak located at a wave vector approximately corresponding to the first neighbor distance within the potential well i.e. @xmath66 , and , more importantly , by the simultaneous onset of spatial correlations at low wave vectors . at high wave vectors the change of @xmath65 from high to low temperatures",
    "looks qualitatively the same at different @xmath67 .",
    "the spatial correlations at low wave vectors , and therefore the mesoscopic and large scale structures , seem instead to depend strongly not only on @xmath45 but also on @xmath67 .",
    "we observe that the data of fig .",
    "2 show no sign of a phase separation , which would be indicated by a rapidly growing peak at low wave vectors .",
    "instead we see at low @xmath60 the onset of spatial correlations extending over different length scales , suggesting the formation of an extended disordered structure .",
    "we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the @xmath65 at the different @xmath67 : at high temperature ( inset of the figure ) , spatial correlations in the system are mainly temperature - controlled , i.e. depend only weakly on @xmath67 . at the lowest temperature ( main frame ) , instead , space correlations are dominated by temperature up to length scales of the order of a few particle diameters . in this region of @xmath60",
    ", i.e. @xmath68 , @xmath65 shows the same @xmath69 dependence for the three values of volume fractions considered .",
    "this clearly indicates the presence of mesoscopic elongated structures ( chains ) as a result of the aggregation driven by the potential energy .",
    "finally , beyond length scales of the order of @xmath14-@xmath27 particle diameters ( i.e. @xmath70 ) , the strength and range of spatial correlations are strongly controlled by the volume fraction .",
    "if we consider now @xmath65 in analogy with the static structure factor of a polymer chain solution  @xcite , we can interpret the mesoscopic length scales @xmath71 as an _ intra - molecular _",
    "regime for spatial correlations due to the elongated aggregates and the macroscopic scales @xmath70 ( i.e. for lengths up to the simulations box linear size ) as an _ inter - molecular _ regime . following this description , the _ intra - molecular _ regime",
    "is strongly controlled by the interaction potential ( and therefore by temperature ) , and extends up to a length - scale which gives a rough estimate of the persistence length of the elongated aggregates ( @xmath72 3 - 4 particle diameters ) . beyond the persistence length",
    ", the @xmath65 captures the _ inter - molecular _ regime : the fact that this regime depends quite dramatically on the volume fraction even in the small interval here considered ( @xmath73 ) suggests that the linear size of the aggregates extends well beyond their persistence length .    to conclude this section",
    ", we make two remarks .",
    "first , we notice that at the lowest volume fraction @xmath61 , one recognizes a power law regime in @xmath65 at intermediate and low @xmath60 .",
    "it is clear that this can not be interpreted as a fractal regime , since the exponent would be less than 1.0 .",
    "it should instead correspond to the crossover from the _ inter - molecular _ regime to an eventual fractal regime which is only detectable for a larger system .",
    "this will be confirmed by the analysis of the structure in the following sections .",
    "second , we observe that , at the highest volume fraction , @xmath62 , @xmath65 displays at low @xmath45 a well defined pre - peak at a wave vector @xmath74 . in network - forming ionic liquids , this kind of pattern in scattering intensity is typically associated to the presence of a network structure @xcite . in gelling colloidal suspensions",
    "it has also been related to the presence of stable clusters of a typical size of @xmath14-@xmath75 particles  @xcite and its connection to gelation is debated .",
    "in fact , @xmath65 can give information only on the typical distances between pairs of particles occurring in the structure and does not allow on its own to discriminate between pairs of particles in the same aggregate or from different aggregates . here",
    ", the pre - peak arises from the crossover between the _ intra - molecular _ and the _ inter - molecular _ regime at this volume fraction due to two competing effects : pairs of particles in the same large aggregate ( chain ) will be typically separated at least by a distance of @xmath14-@xmath27 particle diameters , due to the local rigidity ; pairs of particles separated by larger distances , belonging or not to the same aggregate , will be limited instead upon increasing the volume fraction . with numerical simulations we have the possibility to access further structural features , to complement the information obtained through @xmath65 .",
    "therefore in the following we exploit it by analyzing the local connectivity of particles , as well as the cluster size distribution , as a function of the temperature and of the volume fraction .",
    "as a function of the wave vector at volume fractions @xmath61 , @xmath52 , and @xmath76 at @xmath77 ( main frame ) and @xmath78 ( inset ) .",
    "the full line indicate the dependence @xmath64 . ]",
    "we define the coordination number @xmath79 as the fraction of particles that have exactly @xmath2 neighbors .",
    "two particles are considered to be neighbors if their distance is less that @xmath80=1.1 , the location of the first minimum in the radial distribution function . by means of @xmath79",
    "we characterize the change in the topology of the structure occurring if @xmath45 is decreased . in fig .",
    "[ coord ] , @xmath79 is plotted as a function of inverse temperature for different values of @xmath2 and for the different volume fractions considered here .    as a general result , at high temperatures the vast majority of the particles are isolated , ( @xmath81 not shown ) , and the fraction of dimers , @xmath82 , is relatively high ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "with decreasing @xmath45 this fraction initially increases , but for @xmath84 it starts to rapidly decrease with decreasing @xmath45 .",
    "our data shows that this happens because particles start to form larger structure which are mainly chains : the fraction of particles with exactly two nearest neighbors increases rapidly and these ( local ) configurations become by far the most prevalent ones at low @xmath45 .",
    "last but not least also the fraction of particles with @xmath85 neighbors increases with decreasing @xmath45 .     as a function of inverse temperature .",
    "the different symbols correspond to @xmath82 ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) and @xmath85 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the different connecting lines correspond to @xmath61 ( dashed ) , @xmath44 ( dotted ) and @xmath62 ( full ) . ]    therefore the curves of fig .",
    "[ coord ] indicate that upon decreasing @xmath45 the particles form chains which are connected by bridging points or nodes ( @xmath85 ) to form an open network .",
    "it is interesting to remark that at the lowest temperature there are practically no free particles .",
    "the fraction of dimers ( @xmath82 ) is minor and it significantly decreases with increasing the volume fraction .",
    "the fraction of particles with @xmath87 does not strongly depend on @xmath67 in the range of values explored , whereas the fraction of particles with @xmath85 monotonically increases with @xmath67 : this suggests that the formation of chains is strongly driven from the interaction , whereas the increasing steric hindrances between large aggregates due to increasing @xmath67 will favor the formation of junctions between the chains by counterbalancing the angular repulsion @xmath34 .",
    "we have monitored the aggregation process and characterized the structure of the system on large length scales using @xmath90 , the number of clusters that have exactly @xmath91 particles .",
    "we define that a particle belongs to a cluster if its distance from at least one member of the cluster is less than @xmath80 , the location of the first minimum in the radial distribution function .     for the different temperatures at volume fraction @xmath61 ( a ) , and @xmath62 ( b ) .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath92 . ]     for the different temperatures at volume fraction @xmath61 ( a ) , and @xmath62 ( b ) .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath92 . ]",
    "[ fig6 ]    this distribution is shown in fig .",
    "6 for all temperatures and volume fractions investigated . for the different volume fractions , at high temperatures ( @xmath93 ) the distribution nicely follows an exponential law , a behavior that corresponds to the random formation of transient clusters of non - bonded particles at low densities . around @xmath94 the shape of the distribution starts to change strongly , indicating that dimers are the most probable clusters . at the same time , @xmath90 also starts to show a tail at large @xmath91 , with clusters sizes of the order of a few hundreds particles . at lower temperatures , @xmath90 displays a power law regime for high values of @xmath91 , with a crossover point that moves to larger @xmath91 with decreasing @xmath45 .",
    "this regime is compatible with an exponent around @xmath95 ( the dashed line in the plots of fig .",
    "6 ) in agreement with random percolation  @xcite . by comparing the data at different volume fractions we observe that the temperature at which the power law tail appears increases with increasing volume fraction .",
    "the percolation threshold , estimated as the temperature where @xmath96 of the configurations percolate , monotonically increases from @xmath97 at @xmath61 to @xmath98 at @xmath62 .",
    "this is coherent with the information obtained from @xmath79 , in fig .",
    "[ coord ] : the relative higher amount of bridging between chains upon increasing volume fraction corresponds to a higher probability for the aggregating structure to percolate at the same temperature .",
    "finally , we also conclude from fig .",
    "5 that , once a percolating cluster is formed , the particles rapidly aggregate into a unique interconnected structure .",
    "this is in agreement also with the data of fig .",
    "[ coord ] showing that , at the lowest temperature , there are practically no free particles and the fraction of particles with only one neighbor is negligible , i.e. limited to dangling ends .",
    "this feature seems qualitatively the same here and in simulations performed on systems of smaller size ( @xmath99 particles ) , suggesting that it is not much affected by the system size .",
    "the information contained in figs .",
    "2 - 5 allows us to reach a convincing interpretation of the scattering patterns of fig .",
    "the behavior of @xmath79 indicates that the mesoscopic length scale discussed above corresponds to the formation of semi - flexible chains whose persistence length is directly related to the features of the effective interactions .",
    "the _ inter - molecular _ regime , strongly dependent on the volume fraction , corresponds instead to the formation of a network structure due to bridging between different chains .",
    "depending on the the volume fraction , the extended percolating structure will have different amount of nodes ( i.e. bridging connections ) and therefore , presumably , significantly different mechanical properties .",
    "interestingly , this corresponds to very different patterns in @xmath65 at low wave vectors : from the display of a wide crossover for the softest structure , to the presence of a well defined pre - peak ( i.e. a peak at wave vectors corresponding to distances significantly larger than the particle diameter ) .",
    "differently from the assumption often made that such peak of correlation corresponds to the presence of stable finite clusters , here this pattern indicates instead the persistence length of our elongated aggregates .",
    "our interpretation suggests that , in a case like this , the position of the peak could be therefore related to the mechanical properties of the network .",
    "finally the aggregation process seems to be characterized by the fact that , once that a percolated structure is formed , particles aggregate rapidly into a single network structure and small clusters as well as free particles completely disappear .",
    "this feature , which might be distinctive of aggregation induced colloidal gelation , significantly modifies the cluster size distribution and has some consequences also on the dynamics .",
    "the general understanding of the structure formation discussed here will be relevant to the analysis of the dynamics , which is performed in the following section .",

    "bonds are not persistent enough to create long living structures . upon lowering the temperature ,",
    "bond lifetime becomes the longest relaxation time scale .",
    "moreover , at the lowest temperatures the lifetime of the network nodes becomes comparable to the relaxation times at low wave vectors .",
    "that is , the disordered network structure is persistent enough to affect the dynamics at large length scales . from the figure we also conclude that , whereas the bond lifetime is fairly insensitive to the volume fraction , the node lifetime displays a stronger dependence on @xmath67 : the persistence of the nodes apparently depends on the structural features of the network , which in turn , as seen above , depends on @xmath67",
    "this already suggests , as discussed more in the following , that the network formation is related to the onset of cooperative dynamical processes .",
    "we also observe that at @xmath62 , as also found at @xmath44 @xcite , the relaxation time @xmath120 at the smallest wave vector @xmath121 shows a temperature dependence which becomes stronger than arrhenius at low @xmath45 , whereas this does not happen at the lowest volume fraction @xmath61 . upon increasing @xmath67 ,",
    "the increase of node lifetime is apparently stronger .",
    "again , this suggests that , whereas the bond breaking is an activated process mainly controlled by the potential energy parameters , the node lifetime is actually affected by the features of the different structure at different volume fractions . from the information gained from @xmath65 and our analysis of section [ structure ] , we expect the large lengths scale properties of the structure to play a relevant role in the node lifetime .",
    "we will come back to these considerations in the following , when analyzing the decay of time correlations of particle displacement , bonds , and nodes .      at high temperatures ,",
    "the time dependence of the particle mean squared displacement ( msd ) crosses over from the ballistic @xmath122-dependence at short times to the diffusive , i.e. linear @xmath104-dependence . upon lowering the temperature",
    "we observe the onset of a more complex behavior at a temperature @xmath123 , at which the attraction starts to create persistent bonding . in fig .",
    "[ msd1 ] we plot @xmath124 at @xmath62 for the different temperatures ( main frame ) .",
    "this plot clearly shows that , upon lowering the temperature , two different localization processes arise .",
    "the first one , at @xmath125 , corresponds to a localization length @xmath126 , which shows a relatively weak dependence on further lowering temperature : this is the onset of the caging regime in which a particle is temporarily trapped by its nearest neighbors , due to the formation of bonds  @xcite . at the lowest temperatures ,",
    "the localization process arising at times @xmath127 corresponds to a localization distance of the order of 10 particles diameter , i.e. comparable to the size of the mesh in the disordered network structure . in the inset ,",
    "the data at the lowest temperature @xmath77 , where practically all the particles belong to a single percolated cluster , are directly compared to the contribution coming from the nodes of the network ( particles with coordination number @xmath85 ) , from particles belonging to chains ( @xmath87 ) and from the dangling ends ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this @xmath2-dependence gives two main indications : the first localization process strongly limits the mobility of the network nodes , but the overall msd is dominated by the chain mobility ; the second localization process , present only at the lowest temperature where the lifetime of the network nodes becomes comparable to the longest characteristic time scale , strongly limits the large scale mobility , dominating the msd .     as a function of time at volume fractions @xmath62 for different temperatures .",

    "here it is clear that , whereas the first localization process ( @xmath128 ) is very weakly dependent on @xmath67 , the volume fraction dependence of the second localization process ( @xmath129 ) is much stronger .",

    "our comparative analysis indicates therefore that this complex dynamics has glassy features and strong similarities to the one of dense systems , with the difference that the strong coupling in particle motion ( which originates the structural arrest ) is not induced by the crowding but by the presence of the persistent network .",
    "the fact that the onset of very slow , stretched exponential relaxations only takes place at sufficiently low wave vectors is a consequence of that .",
    "finally , by looking to bond and nodes relaxation we have found that the cooperative processes underlying this network induced glassy dynamics is intimately related to the network nodes ( fig .",
    "[ bond2 ] ) .",
    "we have discussed the behavior of a model for colloidal gels based on the presence of directional effective interactions . in this model , the aggregation leads to an open persistent network structure without imposing a fixed connectivity to the gel units . with these premises ,",
    "our study gives new insights into the physics of colloidal gelation . from the structural point of view",
    ", we have shown that the aggregation process takes place via a random percolation mechanism , but once a percolating structure is formed , it rapidly evolves towards a persistent , fully connected open network .",
    "also in this case , gelation seems associated to the presence of a pre - peak in the static structure factor , here directly related to the network structure .",
    "our comparative analysis of structure and dynamics indicates that the persistent network introduces slow , cooperative processes intimately related to the network nodes and sets in a peculiar kind of glassy dynamics .",
    "this scenario is also consistent with the results of a recent numerical study of diluted dipolar colloidal gels  @xcite .",
    "we think that this points to the formation of a persistent network as the mechanism responsible for the onset of the glassy dynamics in colloidal gels and explains the close connection between gelation and glassy structural arrest typically observed in these systems .",

    "<S> by means of molecular dynamics , we study the structure and the dynamics of a microscopic model for colloidal gels at low volume fractions . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of directional interactions leads to the formation of a persistent interconnected network at temperatures where phase separation does not occur . </S>",
    "<S> we find that large scale spatial correlations strongly depend on the volume fraction and characterize the formation of the persistent network . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a pre - peak in the static structure factor and relate it to the network structure . </S>",
    "<S> the slow dynamics at gelation is characterized by the coexistence of fast collective motion of the mobile parts of the network structure ( chains ) with large scale rearrangements producing stretched exponential relaxations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , once the network is sufficiently persistent , it induces slow , cooperative processes related to the network nodes . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this peculiar glassy dynamics is a hallmark of the physics of colloidal gels at low volume fractions . </S>"
