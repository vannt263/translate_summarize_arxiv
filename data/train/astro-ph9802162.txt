    "long - term , continuous monitoring by the batse all - sky monitor on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ has led to a qualitative change in our picture of the spin - frequency behavior of accreting pulsars ( bildsten et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter ) .",
    "of the four well - measured persistent sources thought to accrete by way of an accretion disk , all display sudden transitions between episodes of steady spin - up and spin - down .",
    "the spin change rate ( i.e. , the absolute value of the pulse frequency derivative ) is nearly equal for spin - up and spin - down , and it is comparable to the torque expected if all the angular momentum of the accreting gas is deposited at the magnetospheric boundary and transferred to the neutron star . in at least some of these systems , however , roche - lobe overflow is thought to occur , and hence the matter inserted into the accretion disk has only one sense of angular momentum ; symmetric torque reversals would thus not be expected .",
    "previous accretion torque models , in which the net torque could be positive or negative depending on the mass accretion rate @xmath0 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , can not easily reproduce the observations ( see ) .",
    "we only list the main arguments here : ( i ) one needs step - wise changes in @xmath1 to produce distinct spin - up and spin - down states ",
    "this seems unlikely ; ( ii ) one would expect changes in @xmath1 to be reflected in the  luminosity @xmath2  there are variations in @xmath2 , but these appear uncorrelated with spin - up / down state ; and ( iii ) one expects at all times a positive correlation between torque and luminosity  for  an anti - correlation is observed during its spin - down state ( ) .",
    "suggestions about a possible cause for the torque reversals have been made by yi , wheeler & vishniac ( ) and nelson et al .",
    "yi et al .  suggested that the reversals were due to small changes in @xmath1 around a critical value at which the system changes from a primarily keplerian flow to a substantially sub - keplerian , radially advective flow .",
    "this addresses points ( i ) and ( ii ) , but not point ( iii ) .",
    "nelson et al .",
    "( ) explored the possibility of having systems in which nothing changes except the sense of rotation of the disks .",
    "they found that this would explain the observations very well .",
    "they quoted a suggestion by makishima et al .",
    "( ) , that in  one might have accretion from a wind and thus form a retrograde disk more easily . as nelson",
    ".  noted , however , it is very hard to imagine how a stable retrograde disk could form , especially in the ultracompact binary , for which all indications are that mass transfer is by roche lobe overflow from a very low - mass companion .    here ,",
    "we suggest a modification of the nelson et al .  picture , viz .",
    ", that it is only the inner part of the disk that is changing its sense of rotation , as a consequence of very strong warping of the disk .",
    "accretion disks are unstable to warping if lit strongly by a central radiation source ( @xcite ) . in numerical simulations which include such irradiation ,",
    "the disk can sometimes become more and more warped , until the inner part has become inclined by well over 90 degrees ( @xcite ; see fig .",
    "6 of that paper for illustrations of a disk with its inner parts flipped over ) .    in section  [ sec : obs ]",
    ", we give an updated summary of the observations . in section  [ sec : warp ] , we briefly discuss the warping process and describe simulations done specifically for binaries .",
    "we proceed to make a qualitative comparison with the observations , and to discuss ramifications .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "batse has monitored five persistent , disk - fed accreting  pulsars for nearly 7 years ( ) . here , we summarize the observations for four of these .",
    "we exclude her  x-1 , since it can not be monitored continuously , but only during the high states of its 35-d precession cycle .    _",
    "4u 1626@xmath367 _ is a 7.66s pulsar in an ultracompact 42min binary .",
    "it has @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "timing measurements suggest we are viewing the binary nearly face - on .",
    "the @xmath5 mass donor probably fills its roche lobe .",
    "the torque history is reviewed in detail by chakrabarty et al .",
    "the pulsar underwent steady spin - up at a mean rate of @xmath6 during 19771990 , and steady spin - down at a mean rate of @xmath7 since that time . the 1990 reversal itself",
    "was not observed , but evidently occurred on a time scale @xmath8 month .",
    "both the spin - up and the spin - down had a significant quadratic trend .",
    "the  luminosity did not change abruptly at the torque reversal , although there is evidence for a gradual , factor of 2 decay over an interval of 15 years .",
    "however , the long - term ( years ) 120kev x - ray spectral shape did change , from @xmath9 during spin - up to @xmath10 during spin - down ( @xcite ) , while the @xmath11 spectrum remained unchanged . during spin - up ,",
    "the pulsar showed strong flares on @xmath12 time scales , but these flares are absent or much less frequent during spin - down ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "1998 , in preparation ) .    quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) were observed both during spin - up ( 0.041hz ; ) and spin - down ( 0.048hz ; ) .",
    "the detailed sideband structure of the x - ray pulsations and the qpo during spin - down suggests that there is x - ray reprocessing or scattering in material on a prograde orbit , likely at small radius ( kommers , chakrabarty , & lewin ) .",

    "_ exosat _ observations in 1983 and 1984 failed to detect it .",
    "when detected again at a low luminosity in 1987 , it was spinning down at a mean rate of @xmath16 ( 19891991 ) .",
    "batse has observed continued spin - down since 1991 , apart from a short spin - up episode and an episode in which the source was not detectable .",
    "the torque reversals observed by batse were resolved in 5-day - averaged spin measurements .",
    "the long - term mean  luminosity was brighter during the 1970s spin - up interval ( and also during the batse spin - up event ) than during the spin - down intervals in the 1980s and 1990s .",
    "however , during the extended spin - down interval observed by batse , an anti - correlation between torque and  luminosity was found : increased spin - down for increased  flux .",
    "the luminosity during spin - down occasionally flared to values similar to those measured during spin - up in the 1970s",
    ". the x - ray spectrum did not change drastically between the 1970s and the late 1980s ( ) , although considerable variability in the hydrogen column density has been observed .",

    "it has @xmath4 .",
    "3 has shown a long - term spin - up trend of @xmath17 since 1972 , but batse observations resolve this trend into alternating episodes of spin - up and spin - down on 10100 day time scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "the torque distribution is bimodal , with preferred spin - up / spin - down rates of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( ) .",
    "the torque reversals are unresolved in the batse measurements and must occur in @xmath20d . over a factor of 6 range in luminosity , _ no _ correlation between torque and luminosity is found , and the mean flux is comparable in the two torque states ( ) . the spectral shape , pulse profile , and pulsed fraction are correlated with luminosity .    _ oao 1657@xmath3415 _ is a 38s pulsar in a 10.4d binary with an unidentified companion which is inferred to be an ob supergiant .",
    "it has @xmath4 ( ) . there is no direct evidence for an accretion disk , but the timing properties of the pulsar strongly suggest disk accretion . like 3 ,",
    "the pulsar has shown a long - term spin - up trend since 1979 of @xmath21 , but batse observations show alternating episodes of spin - up and spin - down on 10100d time scales , with typical rates of + 7 and @xmath22 ( ) .",
    "the torque reversals are unresolved in the batse measurements .",
    "no correlation between torque and luminosity is observed , although this has only been tested over a small range ( factor of 2 ) in luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "wijers and pringle ( 1997 ; hereafter wp97 ) have investigated in detail the behavior of irradiated accretion disks in binary stars subject to internal viscous forces , radiation reaction due to illumination from the central source , and the tide from the mass donor . the main aim was to see whether warped disks could form , and whether their precession could lead to the superorbital periodicities observed in many  binaries . here , we summarize the results relevant to the torque reversals , and compare them to the observations .    whether the disk becomes unstable to warping depends on the parameter @xmath23 , given by ( eq .  18 , wp97 ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ratio of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 viscosities ( see @xcite ) , @xmath28 the accretion efficiency , @xmath29 the disk s  albedo , @xmath30 the neutron - star mass , and @xmath31 the outer disk radius .",
    "wp97 find that for @xmath32 , the disks are stable ; for @xmath33 , the outer parts become warped and precess retrogradely , but the inner parts remain flat ; for @xmath34 , the inner parts become warped as well , precessing progradely ; and for @xmath35 , the disks start to behave somewhat chaotically , precessing less steadily , and often having inner parts tilted by more than 90 degrees .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath23 in a real system is quite uncertain , mostly because the disk albedo is poorly known ( see wp97 ) , but for typical  binary parameters , one will be close to the unstable regime .",
    "we will _ assume _ that @xmath23 varies , and associate the switch between spin - up and spin - down state with a switch between a prograde and retrograde inner disk ( for prograde pulsar rotation ) .",
    "what could drive the variations is unclear , as @xmath23 does not depend directly on quantities such as @xmath1 which are usually thought to vary .    the one parameter which might lead to a switch between two states is the disk albedo . as discussed by wp97 ,",
    "the albedo likely depends on the angle of incidence , with @xmath36 for grazing and @xmath37 for normal incidence .",
    "one could imagine a situation in which a disk is stable , until a random excursion changes the tilt such that @xmath23 is raised above the critical value , and the disk starts to become warped .",
    "this would increase @xmath38 further , leading to further growth , etc .",
    "it remains problematic , however , how one would reset the system .    0.9      an example of the time evolution of the disk tilt angle for @xmath39",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : tilt ] .",
    "it shows that only the inner disk becomes tilted by more than 90 degrees ( i.e. , retrograde ) .",
    "reversing the sense of rotation in the inner disk would lead to torque reversals similar to those observed , just as reversing the whole disk would in the picture of nelson et al .",
    "a retrograde inner disk could also lead to the anti - correlation between torque and luminosity observed in the spin - down state of .    in the model in fig .",
    "[ fig : tilt ] , as in most of the simulations we tried , the average inner disk tilt does not reach 180 .",
    "in contrast , for most values of @xmath23 leading to prograde inner disks , the tilts are close to 0 .",
    "if generally true , then for a roughly spherical magnetosphere the spin - change rate in the spin - down state should be systematically lower than that in the spin - up state .",
    "for all four sources , the spin - down rate is indeed smaller , by a factor 1.2 to  4 .",
    "variations around the mean of about 30  ( rms ) in the inner disk tilt angle occur with a characteristic period of @xmath40 time units .",
    "this corresponds to about @xmath41s in , @xmath42s in 3 , @xmath43s in , and @xmath44s in .",
    "( note , however , that @xmath39 is not necessarily appropriate for all systems . )",
    "these variations result in torque fluctuations , which should contribute to the torque noise observed in  pulsars variations and internal torques ; see lamb , pines , & shaham ( ) . ] . for 3 and",
    ", this may not be very relevant , as the characteristic period is comparable to the duration of a spin - up or spin - down state .",
    "however , for  and , it is much shorter than the state duration , and we can compare the noise induced by the fluctuations with the observations .",
    "for , the tilt variations correspond to a torque noise power of @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "this is similar to what is observed ( b97 ) . for , we need to integrate the tilt variations over @xmath43s , the shortest timescale on which the torque noise power has been measured .",
    "we find @xmath47 , somewhat larger than the observed @xmath48 at @xmath49 ( ) , but perhaps not inconsistent given the uncertainties in what a real disk would do",
    ".      an interesting consequence of associating spin - down with a flipped - over state is that one should be viewing the neutron star through the disk at least part of the time .",
    "we estimate the surface density using a steady , unwarped shakura - sunyaev disk .",
    "for all four systems , @xmath50 .",
    "the typical radius where the line of sight crosses the disk is where the disk tilt is @xmath51 , about @xmath52 in our simulations . in physical units ,",
    "this ranges between @xmath53 and @xmath54 cm ( in  and , respectively ) . with @xmath55 and viscosity parameter @xmath56",
    ", we find a surface density of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively ( eq .  5.45 of @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to column densities @xmath59 of about @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the disk central temperature due to viscous heating is @xmath62 and @xmath63k , respectively , and the ionization parameter @xmath64 a few @xmath65 ( cgs ) for both cases .",
    "hence , little ionization is expected , and the disk would be opaque to low - energy x - rays for the dense case .    in a twisted disk , the extra viscosity associated with the misalignment between neighboring annuli will lower the column density somewhat . compared to a similar disk with no irradiation , the column density in the warped disk shown in figure  [ fig : tilt ] is lower by a factor  5 in the outer parts of the disk , and by a factor  2.5 in the inner parts .    good data on possible spectral changes associated with the torque reversals exist only for  ( sect .  [",
    "sec : obs ] ) . the observed decrease and hardening of the 120kev flux in that source may reflect a line of sight through the disk .",
    "the spectrum changed mostly below @xmath66 , suggesting that absorption might play a role .",
    "vaughan & kitamoto ( ) , however , found that the spectrum could not be fit well by simply increasing the column density @xmath59 ; for an @xmath59 sufficient to explain the reduction at close to 10 , one would expect no soft x - rays whatsoever",
    ".    increasing @xmath59 may not be quite appropriate , as ( i ) matter in the disk is likely neither cold nor homogeneous ; ( ii ) scattering might be important , as the disk subtends a large solid angle ; and ( iii ) the obscuration will vary will time , due to precession of the inner disk  for suitable inclinations , the source may even be unobscured part of the time . of course , given freedom to change all these , one likely can fit almost anything .",
    "vaughan & kitamoto could fit the spectrum assuming partial covering , where 86% of the source is obscured with @xmath67 and the remainder unobscured . if this were the correct model , it might reflect either spatial or temporal covering ( the spectrum was a long - term average ) .",
    "there are several difficulties in applying the warped disk model to the torque reversal observations in detail .",
    "the primary one concerns the time scales between the reversals . in those simulations",
    "where a retrograde inner disk arose , its mean inclination remained relatively stable ( and @xmath68 ) after its initial growth , with only short excursions to prograde flow .",
    "this is at odds with the observations , which show roughly equal times in spin - up and spin - down .",
    "furthermore , each of the four systems considered has an aspect that is not easily explained in the retrograde disk picture .",
    "in , there is qpo evidence for prograde motion during spin - down , likely at small radius ( sect .",
    "[ sec : obs ] ) . in ,",
    "the torque reversals observed by batse were clearly accompanied by luminosity changes . finally , in both high - mass x - ray binaries (",
    "cen x-3 and oao 1657@xmath69 ) , the lack of a clear correlation between spin - change rate and luminosity ( in both spin - up and spin - down states ) seems to confound all the existing models .",
    "a number of potentially important effects have been neglected in the wp97 simulations .",
    "these include : the dependence of the albedo on angle of incidence ( and the resulting variations of @xmath23 ) , the increased disk scale height and thus reduced density due to irradiation ( resulting in larger @xmath70 and possibly different disk opacity ) , and the varying `` splash point '' where the accretion stream  which is in the orbital plane  hits the precessing disk ( resulting , e.g. , in inward advection in addition to viscosity ) . accounting for these properly may considerably change the detailed predictions for warped disks .",
    "however , the existence of warps and transitions to retrograde flow under certain conditions seem a general feature .",
    "it has been previously suggested that retrograde disk flows would be an elegant explanation for torque reversals in disk - fed x - ray pulsars .",
    "it has been an open question , however , how such a flow would be created when mass is transferred by roche - lobe overflow and thus enters the accretion disk in a prograde orbit .",
    "we have pointed out that strong disk warping may produce a retrograde flow close to an accreting neutron star from an initially prograde flow in the outer disk .",
    "while this simple picture allows us to understand some of the characteristics of the observations , it does not match all of them .",
    "this could be because the models currently neglects many potentially important effects .",
    "our main point here , however , is that quasi - stable retrograde disk flows are physically plausible , and that they may thus be ( part of ) what causes the spin - down states in persistent disk - fed x - ray pulsars .    despite the uncertainties in the models ,",
    "it remains true generally that if the spin - down state is due to a flipped - over inner disk , it should be associated with enhanced absorption .",
    "one would expect relatively strong absorption edges , especially of iron , which could be looked for with high - resolution spectroscopy . the absorption should vary with time as the inner disk precesses ( although the precession is not necessarily very coherent ) . with more disk surface exposed to the central x - ray source",
    ", we also would expect increased scattering and stronger fluorescence lines .",
