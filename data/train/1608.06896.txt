    "for both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of hadron spectroscopy , the potential model description in the non - relativistic regime of qcd @xcite is found to be tremendously successful . on this basis , we have pursued a nonrelativistic constituent quark model ( nrqm ) @xcite for mesons containing a heavy quark / anti - quark and a light quark / anti - quark .",
    "we consider cornell potential for study because it naturally leads to two choices of  parent \" hamiltonian , one based on the coulomb part and the other on the linear term . in the potential , @xmath5 , we consider the coulombic part as parent and the linear as perturbation @xcite for short distance , as well as the linear part as parent and the coulombic part as perturbation @xcite to generate quark confinement at long distance .",
    "the model uses the two - body schrodinger s equation and obtains the first order perturbed wave function of the qcd potential using dalgarno s method @xcite .",
    "+ in one of our earlier work @xcite , the charge radii of various heavy and light mesons were found to be very small for the coulombic part compared to the linear part , where variationally improved perturbation theory ( vipt ) @xcite was used . in another work @xcite ,",
    "we have calculated the charge radii of mesons , where the results for light mesons were found to agree well with the experimental values but for heavy flavored b mesons , the results were large compared to other theoretical models . also the confinement parameter ` @xmath6 ' could not be incorporated in our ealier work @xcite . + in the present paper , we take into account these limitations and revisit the bound states @xmath0 and calculate the charge radii . we also obtain the expressions for form factors with the introduction of two cut off parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the present model is found to be quite successful @xcite in the calculation of rms radius , mass and isgur wise function of various heavy light mesons . + the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we outline the formalism where we have discussed the model and obtain the expressions for form factors . in section 3 , we summarize the results and discussions . section 4 contains conclusion .",
    "the non - relativistic two body schrodinger equation @xcite is @xmath7 so that the first order perturbed eigenfunction @xmath8 and eigenenergy @xmath9 can be obtained using the relation @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xmath12    we calculate the total wave function using dalgarno s method of perturbation for the potential @xcite @xmath13    where -@xmath14 is due to the color factor , @xmath15 is the strong coupling constant , r is the inter quark distance , @xmath6 is the confinement parameter ( phenomenologically , @xmath16 @xcite ) and ` @xmath17 ' is a constant scale factor . + it is already seen @xcite that dalgarno s method in general conflicts with the quantum mechanical idea that the scale factor ` @xmath17 ' should not have an observable effect except the energy shift . for the validation of the quantum mechanical expectation",
    "we therefore consider the scale factor @xmath18 in the potential of equation ( 5 ) .",
    "+ however it is well known that at short distance coulomb potential plays a more dominant role than the linear confinement because while the former is inversely proportional to ` r ' , the latter is linear .",
    "similarly , for large distance the confinement takes over the coulomb effect . therefore if the inter - quark seperation",
    "` r ' can be roughly divided into short distance ( @xmath19 ) and long distance ( @xmath20 ) , effectively one of the potential will dominate over the other .",
    "in such situation confinement parameter ( @xmath6 ) and the strong coupling parameter ( @xmath15 ) can be considered as effective and appropriate small pertubative parameters . + with @xmath18 , for potential of type ( 5 ) , one of the choice for parent and perturbed hamiltonian is @xmath21 and @xmath22    the total wave function for this case is @xmath23\\left ( \\frac{r}{a_0}\\right ) ^{-\\epsilon } e^{-\\frac{r}{a_0}},\\ ] ]    where the normalization constant @xmath24 is    @xmath25 ^ 2\\left ( \\frac{r}{a_0}\\right ) ^{-2\\epsilon } e^{-\\frac{2r}{a_0}}dr\\right ] ^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the masses of the quark and antiquark respectively , @xmath30 is the reduced mass of the mesons and    @xmath31    is the correction for relativistic effect @xcitedue to dirac modification factor .",
    "+ similarly , the wave function upto @xmath32 for another choice of parent and perturbed hamiltonian of ( 5 ) , + where    @xmath33    and @xmath34    is    @xmath35a_i[\\rho_1 r+\\rho_0 ] \\left ( \\frac{r}{a_0}\\right ) ^{-\\epsilon},\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 $ ] is the airy function @xcite and @xmath37 is the normalization constant ,    @xmath38 ^ 2 \\left ( a_i[\\rho_1 r+\\rho_0]\\right ) ^2 \\left ( \\frac{r}{a_0}\\right ) ^{-2\\epsilon}dr\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ]    the co - efficients of the series solution as occured in dalgarno s method of perturbation , are the function of @xmath39 and b : @xmath40 @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    the parameters : @xmath45    @xmath46 ^{\\frac{2}{3}}.\\ ] ]    ( in our case n=1 for ground state )    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    it is to be noted that the application of airy function as meson wave function needs suitable cut off to make the analysis normalizable and convergent .",
    "we therefore set a cut off @xmath52 in the integration limit and we fix it to 1 @xmath53 @xcite for our calculations .",
    "+ to find the cut offs @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we use the two choices of perturbative conditions : + choice - i : @xmath56    choice - ii :    @xmath57    from ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) we can find the bounds on r upto which case - i and ii are valid .",
    "case - i gives the cut off on the short distance @xmath58 and case - ii gives the cut off on the long distance @xmath59 .",
    "+ in table-1 , we show the bounds on @xmath54 and @xmath55 in @xmath53 which yields exact / most restrictive upper bounds of the quantities to be calculated .",
    "however for the continuity of the potential as well as the wave function it is required to set the integral limit @xmath60 @xcite in the theory .    .@xmath54 and @xmath55 in fermi with @xmath18 and @xmath16 [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have studied the detail behaviour of the form factors with both relativistic and non - relativistic limit .",
    "graphs for form factors of the mesons are shown displaying the variation with momentum transfer square ( @xmath61 ) . from the graphs it is seen that the form factors for charged mesons decreases with increases values of @xmath61 , but for neutral mesons a temporary rise in form factor is obsereved , a feature not uncommon even for light neutral kaon @xcite also .",
    "+ the charge radii of various heavy flavored mesons are calculated within a qcd inspired quark model pursued by us in recent years . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", the model did not show good results for the charge radii of b mesons , though the model was quite successful in the prediction of results for light mesons and heavy flavored d mesons .",
    "here we have improved our earlier results @xcite by introducing two cut off parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in earlier analysis @xcite ,",
    "the confinement parameter ` @xmath6 ' was taken to be zero due to perturbative constraints .",
    "however with the improved version of our present work , we overcome such limitation by incorporating the value of confinement parameter to be @xmath16 .",
