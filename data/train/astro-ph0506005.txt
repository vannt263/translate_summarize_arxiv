    "as discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper  ii ) , accretion disks are commonly believed to be present in both cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and quasi - stellar objects and active galactic nuclei ( qsos / agns ) .",
    "a property that cvs and qsos have in common is that both types of objects sometimes present blue - shifted absorption troughs in uv resonance lines , giving direct observational evidence for an outflowing wind",
    ". both types of objects also show the existence of a persistent velocity structure in their absorption troughs ( when present ) over significantly long time scales ( paper  i ) .    in order for a disk wind to account for the wide / broad resonance line absorption structures observed in many cvs and qsos",
    ", it must be able to account for the steady velocity structure that is observed .",
    "the 2.5d time - dependent disk wind models of pereyra and collaborators , both for cvs and qsos , have steady disk wind solutions @xcite .",
    "the earlier 1d disk wind models of murray and collaborators also find steady disk wind solutions @xcite .",
    "however , in the literature it has been argued that line - driven disk winds are `` intrinsically unsteady '' because of the increasing gravity along the streamlines at wind base that is characteristic of disk winds ( see paper  i ; paper  ii ) .",
    "since the steady nature of cv and qso wind flows is an observational constraint , whether line - driven disk winds are steady is a significant issue .",
    "our objective is to study this issue through a semi - analytical method independent of our previous 2.5d numerically intensive simulation efforts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in paper  i we showed that an increase in gravity at wind base , that is characteristic of disk winds , does _ not _ imply an unsteady wind solution .",
    "we also developed mathematically `` simple '' models that mimic the disk environment and we showed that _ line - driven disk winds can be steady_. in paper  ii we extended the concepts presented in paper  i , and discussed in detail many aspects that were mentioned in paper  i.    the goal of this paper is to apply the concepts introduced in paper  i and paper  ii to more realistic models that implement the exact flux distribution above a standard accretion disk .",
    "we compare and find good agreement with the steady cv disk wind solutions found through numerically intensive calculations by @xcite and @xcite .    in ",
    "[ sec_generalcomments ] we present a general discussion of the reduction of the 2.5d models of @xcite to a series of 1d models by neglecting radial terms .",
    "we shall see that , although this a rough approximation high above the disk , it is quite accurate near the disk surface .",
    "we reduce the 2.5d model of pereyra and collaborators to a series of 1d equations in  [ sec_reduction ] . in  [ sec_results ] we present the results of our series of 1d models for different disk radius .",
    "we show that the critical point in the inner disk regions is found near the disk surface , allowing for an analysis of the solutions with steady wind mass loss rates .",
    "a summary and conclusions are presented in  [ sec_sumcon ] .",
    "the analysis of existence for steady line - driven wind solutions discussed in paper  i and paper  ii correspond to 1d models .",
    "thus , to apply them to a 2.5d model , we first reduce the 2.5d model to a series of 1d models . to do this",
    "we consider the following : the wind in cvs tend to be vertical ( perpendicular to the disk ) .",
    "there is observational , theoretical , and computational evidence for this . in cvs",
    "the p - cygni type line profiles are observed only in low inclination systems ( close to disk face - on ) and with high inferred disk mass accretion rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this orientation angle effect was one of the observational properties of cvs that led to the early suggestion by @xcite that the outflows detected in cvs originate from the accretion disk .",
    "from a theoretical standpoint , if the wind originates from a steady disk , then the radial forces at wind base ( disk surface ) must be at equilibrium , thus the wind must start off vertical .",
    "we note here that by `` vertical '' we actually mean `` non - radial , '' since the wind starts off with an azimuthal component due to disk rotation .",
    "we also note here that although the disk wind must in principal start vertical at its base , this does not necessarily imply that the wind will continue predominantly vertical .",
    "for example , in the case of qsos / agns , disk wind models @xcite indicate that the wind tends to quickly become radial in nature .    however , computational 2.5d models of cv disk winds have produced winds that tend to be vertical in nature .",
    "theoretical resonance line profiles calculated from these models are consistent with observed line profiles in their general form , in the magnitudes of wind velocities implied by the absorption components , in the fwhm of the emission components , and in the strong dependence with inclination angle @xcite .",
    "therefore , near the wind base ( disk surface ) , a cv disk wind at a given radius can be well approximated by a vertical 1d model .",
    "high above the disk rotational forces come into play ( no longer at equilibrium with the radial component of gravity ) , streamlines collide , and the density / velocity wind structure will be 2.5d ( i.e. , 2d with an azimuthal velocity component ) @xcite .",
    "although a 1d vertical model is not accurate high above the disk for the above reasons , it does give accurate results near wind base .",
    "as was shown by @xcite for early type stars , and was discussed in paper  ii for 1d line - driven winds , the wind mass loss rate is determined by the position of the critical point . as we show below , for the cv parameters we use in this section [ taken from the models of @xcite ] , at radii where there is significant contributions to the wind mass loss , the critical point is near the disk surface .",
    "therefore , disk wind characteristics for 2.5d cv models can be addressed .",
    "the equations of state , mass , and momentum of the 2.5d cv disk wind model of @xcite are , respectively :    @xmath0    @xmath1    and    @xmath2 \\ ;             \\right)^\\alpha \\;\\;\\;\\ ; ; \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath3    @xmath4 \\ ;                \\right)^\\alpha \\nonumber \\;\\;\\;\\ ; ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the pressure , @xmath6 is the density , @xmath7 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the corresponding velocity components in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath11 is the gravitational constant , @xmath12 is the mass of the white dwarf , @xmath13 is the thomson cross section per mass , @xmath14 is the speed of light , @xmath15 is the ion thermal velocity , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the cak line force parameters . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the corresponding radiation flux components given by :    @xmath20 ^ 4 }     \\ ; r ' d\\phi dr ' \\;\\;\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ]    and    @xmath21 ^ 4 }    \\ ; r ' d\\phi dr ' \\;\\;\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ]    @xmath22 and @xmath23 are defined as :    @xmath24^{\\alpha+4 } }    \\ ; r ' d\\phi dr ' \\;\\;\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ]    and    @xmath25^{\\alpha+4 } }    \\ ; r ' d\\phi dr ' \\;\\;\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ]    where in turn @xmath26 is the rate of energy per area , at a given radius @xmath27 , radiated by a standard disk @xcite , that is :    @xmath28 \\;\\;\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the inner disk radius . in cvs , @xmath29 is approximately equal to the white dwarf radius .",
    "we note that in equations  ( [ equ_pkb2_fz])-([equ_pkb2_sr ] ) there is an implicit assumption that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the outer disk radius .",
    "the total disk luminosity @xmath32 is given by    @xmath33    where @xmath31 is the outer disk radius .",
    "thus    @xmath34    \\right\\ } \\;\\;\\;\\ ; ; \\ ] ]    assuming @xmath30    @xmath35    we define    @xmath36    considering equations  ( [ equ_pkb2_ldisk ] ) and ( [ equ_pkb2_gamma ] ) , equation  ( [ equ_pkb2_q1 ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath37 \\;\\;\\;\\ ; .\\ ] ]    additionally , we define two dimensionless functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 :    @xmath40    { z^2     \\over     \\left[\\left(r^2+r'^2+z^2 - 2rr'\\cos\\phi\\right)^{1/2}\\right]^4 }    \\ ; r ' d\\phi dr ' \\;\\;\\;\\ ; ; \\ ] ]    @xmath41    { z^{\\alpha+2 }     \\over     \\left[\\left(r^2+r'^2+z^2 - 2rr'\\cos\\phi\\right)^{1/2}\\right]^{\\alpha+4 } }    \\ ; r ' d\\phi dr ' \\;\\;\\;\\ ; .\\ ] ]    it follows that    @xmath42    @xmath43    in reducing the 2.5d model to a series of 1d models , for simplicity , we assume an isothermal wind . we do not expect this approximation to significantly change the results of this work , as is illustrated in the intermediate models of @xcite [ see figures  6 and 7 of @xcite ] .",
    "this , on one hand , significantly simplifies the analysis , and on the other hand gives a predefined temperature structure [ namely : @xmath44 that is a requirement of the 1d models of this work ( see paper  i ; paper  ii ) .",
    "thus the equation of state we assume , for the application to the 2.5d cv disk wind model , is    @xmath45    we also assume that the streamlines , starting from the disk at a given radius @xmath27 , are predominantly vertical . as discussed in  [ sec_generalcomments ] , this assumption is justified on observational , theoretical , and computational grounds .",
    "the mass conservation equation is equivalent to the 1d models of @xcite , namely , for a given @xmath27    @xmath46    where we are determining the existence of 1d steady ( stationary ) solutions , and where    @xmath47    and @xmath48 is an integration constant , @xmath49 is the height above the disk , and @xmath27 is the radius where a given streamline begins .",
    "thus for each value of @xmath27 considered , a given 1d model is developed .",
    "we note that in equation  ( [ equ_pkb21_masscons ] ) , @xmath48 is not the wind mass loss rate ( as in paper  i and paper  ii ) , but only an integration constant .",
    "we have used the symbol @xmath48 following the notation of paper  i and paper  ii",
    ". however , the wind mass loss rate @xmath50 can be obtained by ( after first determining the values of @xmath48 for different values of @xmath27 )    @xmath51    for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , thus for @xmath52 , @xmath54 [ equation  ( [ equ_pkb21_masscons ] ) ] that is the integration of equation  ( [ equ_pkb2_masscons ] ) assuming stationary solutions and neglecting radial velocities .",
    "therefore , equation  ( [ equ_pkb21_masscons ] ) is accurate near the disk surface and it is also accurate towards infinity ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) .",
    "however , equation  ( [ equ_pkb21_masscons ] ) is not accurate at intermediate values of @xmath49 where 2.5d effects become important @xcite . using the accurate results near the disk surface , as discussed in  [ sec_generalcomments ]",
    ", we study whether wind solutions with steady mass loss rates exist .    in reducing the 2.5d model to a series of 1d models",
    ", we additionally neglect the effect of a maximum possible value for the line radiation force @xcite , that are represented in the models of @xcite and @xcite by including a `` @xmath57 '' function in the line force terms [ see equation  ( [ equ_pkb2_momz ] ) ] .",
    "on one hand , we do not expect this approximation to significantly change the results of this work . in the intermediate models of @xcite this effect",
    "was found to be most significant in the low density region high above the inner disk region . on the other hand , this allows the momentum equation to take a form equivalent to the momentum equation of paper  ii , that is the form of the momentum equation assumed in the 1d models of this work .",
    "thus , within the assumption of a predominately vertical wind , assuming stationary solutions , neglecting radial velocities , and considering equation  ( [ equ_pkb2_momz ] ) , the momentum equation for the 1d models ( at a given @xmath27 ) becomes    @xmath58    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are given by equations  ( [ equ_pkb21_upsilon ] ) and ( [ equ_pkb21_zeta ] ) , respectively .",
    "the series of 1d models derived from the 2.5d disk wind model , can be represented within the 1d models of paper  ii , through the following parameterization :    @xmath59    where the body force @xmath60 , the area function @xmath61 , and the line opacity weighted flux @xmath62 are defined for a given @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the mass conservation equation and the momentum equation have the form of the equations of paper  ii . the isothermal equation of motion",
    "is therefore ,    @xmath63    defining the characteristic distance @xmath64 , gravitational force @xmath65 , area @xmath66 , and line - opacity weighted flux @xmath67 ( see paper  i ; paper  ii ) through    @xmath68    the equation of motion becomes    @xmath69    where    @xmath70",
    "@xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73    the parameters @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 ( see paper  i ; paper  ii ) are given by    @xmath77    where    @xmath78    taking @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the spatial variable @xmath81 ( see paper  ii )    @xmath82    becomes    @xmath83    the equation of motion , expressed in terms of @xmath81 , becomes    @xmath84    where the function @xmath85 is now given by    @xmath86    the nozzle function @xmath87 for each @xmath27 is given by ( paper  ii ) :    @xmath88 \\;\\;\\;\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    additionally we shall recall the definition of the @xmath89 function as defined in paper  i and paper  ii    @xmath90    that we shall apply in the following section .",
    "thus , we have reduced the 2.5d models to a series of 1d models by solving the hydrodynamic equations in the vertical direction and neglecting radial terms .",
    "that is , for a given radial distance @xmath27 , we have a 1d model with @xmath91 as the independent spatial variable . as discussed above these models",
    "are accurate near the disk surface .",
    "since , as we see below , the corresponding critical point for inner radii is near the disk surface , the 1d models for the inner disk regions determine that disk wind flows with steady mass loss rates are possible .",
    "the models can be used to estimate local mass loss rates ( by determining local density at the sonic point ) as well as velocity and density wind structure near the disk surface in the inner region .",
    "for the 1d wind models , we implement the set of parameters used by @xcite corresponding to a cv , namely :    @xmath92    we use the line force parameters also used by @xcite [ and @xcite and @xcite ] , namely    @xmath93    as with the analysis of the isothermal cak stellar wind ( paper  ii ) , we first consider , for a given @xmath27 , the @xmath94 function for the 1d vertical wind model with the flux distribution of a standard @xcite disk .",
    "as discussed in paper  ii , @xmath94 must be negative at the critical point ( i.e. , @xmath94 must be negative in order for there to exist values of @xmath81 , @xmath75 , and @xmath95 that satisfy the critical point conditions ) .",
    "second , we consider the nozzle function , that as we found in paper  ii , for the case of an isothermal wind must be a locally increasing function at the critical point ( i.e. , it must have a positive spatial derivative at the critical point ) .",
    "third , for the spatial points where the first two conditions hold , through the nozzle function @xmath87 , the @xmath89 function , the normalized wind mass loss rate @xmath76 , and the calculation of @xmath96 under critical point conditions , as discussed in paper  ii , we determine if a local solution exists by verifying whether or not the condition    @xmath97    holds .",
    "fourth , within the set of points that fulfill the first three conditions , we iteratively determine the position of the critical point such that the wind reaches sound speed at the sonic height of the model ( as discussed in paper  ii ) .    as a consistency check , for a given @xmath27 , we superimpose a plot of the nozzle function @xmath87 and the @xmath98 function evaluated with the corresponding velocities @xmath99 . as discussed in paper  ii , in the supersonic wind regime where the @xmath94 function is negative ( region ii ) , for points other than the critical point , the following conditions must hold    @xmath100    and at the critical point    @xmath101    for @xmath102 , figure  [ fig_pkb21_02_h ] shows that the @xmath94 function is negative from the sonic point to beyond 1000 times the sonic height .",
    "figure  [ fig_pkb21_02_n ] shows that the nozzle function @xmath87 , corresponding to a vertical streamline at @xmath102 , is a monotonically increasing function from the sonic point to beyond 1000 times the sonic height .",
    "it is shown , in figure  [ fig_pkb21_02_l ] , that equation  ( [ equ_local4 ] ) holds from the sonic height to beyond 1000 times the sonic height , showing that local solutions to the equation of motion exist throughout the fore mentioned spatial region . by `` local solution '' at a given spatial point , we mean the integration of the equation of motion in the vicinity of the given point , assuming the point to be the critical point .",
    "figure  [ fig_pkb21_02_v ] shows the velocity vs. height obtained upon integrating the equation of motion with the condition of achieving the correct sonic height of the model . as a consistency check ,",
    "figure  [ fig_pkb21_02_nb ] verifies that equations  ( [ equ_app1 ] ) and ( [ equ_app2 ] ) hold for the solution obtained .",
    "figures  [ fig_pkb21_10_h]-[fig_pkb21_10_nb ] , figures  [ fig_pkb21_20_h]-[fig_pkb21_20_nb ] , and figures  [ fig_pkb21_50_h]-[fig_pkb21_50_nb ] plot the results from an equivalent analysis to wind streamlines starting at @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 respectively .",
    "the results show that steady line - driven disk wind solutions exist for a standard shakura - sunyaev disk .    a significant result",
    "we find is that the critical point tends to be closer to the disk surface in the inner disk regions , and farther out from the disk surface in the outer disk regions .",
    "physically this is due to the length scales in these different regions .",
    "the disk wind , at each radii , results from the balancing of the gravitational forces and the radiation pressure forces . this balance can be presented quantitatively by the nozzle function defined in paper  i and paper  ii .",
    "the spatial dependence of the nozzle function in turn is crucial in determining the critical point position . as larger disk radii",
    "are considered , the scale length of the corresponding nozzle function also increases , and therefore the critical point position increases as well .",
    "also , the resulting local wind mass loss rates , for the different radii considered , are in good agreement with the 2.5d numerically intensive cv disk wind models of @xcite ; for example for a radius of @xmath106 the local wind mass loss rates found in this work is @xmath107 , and for the same physical model parameters the previous numerically intensive 2.5d calculations estimated a value of @xmath108 for the same radius . by confirming the overall earlier results of pereyra and collaborators",
    ", we conclude that the likely scenario for the wind outflows in cvs is a line - driven disk wind .",
    "this scenario was suggested for cvs early on by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the line - driven disk wind scenario was able to account for the general forms of the @xmath1091549 line profile and its general dependence on viewing angle [ for a review on cv properties in general , see @xcite ] .",
    "the steady nature of line - driven disk wind that we find here may also be relevant to qso studies .",
    "@xcite had suggested this scenario early - on based on observational constraints . the first serious attempt to study this scenario was by @xcite , who developed 1d streamline models and found that this scenario could account for several qso observational features , such as the terminal wind velocities inferred from broad absorption lines ( bals ) ( when present ) and the general form of single - trough bals ( when present ) . as discussed in the introduction , an additional constraint on the bal region ,",
    "is that it presents a steady velocity structure .",
    "our results here show that the line - driven disk wind scenario is consistent with the observed steady velocity structure .",
    "thus both observational constraints and theoretical / computational studies to date seem to indicate that the line - driven disk wind scenario is a promising one to account for the bals commonly observed in qsos .    in future work",
    "we plan to study several aspects of this scenario and develop more realistic models .",
    "in paper  i we had shown that steady wind solutions can exist by using `` simple '' models that mimic the disk environment .",
    "these models are more readily analyzable than the more detailed models presented here . in paper",
    "ii we extended the concepts of paper  i , and discussed in detail aspects of the steady / unsteady wind analysis that was presented in paper  i. the objective of this work is to determine , in a manner independent of the results of previous numerically - intensive 2.5d hydrodynamic simulations , whether steady line - driven disk wind solutions exist under the flux distribution of a standard disk @xcite .",
    "our main conclusion pertaining to the more realistic models presented here is that a line - driven wind , arising from a steady disk using the flux distribution of a standard shakura - sunyaev disk model , is steady . as we had discussed in paper  ii , when including gas pressures effects , the spatial dependence of the nozzle function continues to play a key role in determining the steady / unsteady nature of supersonic line - driven wind solutions .",
    "these results are consistent with the steady nature of the 1d streamline disk wind models of murray and collaborators @xcite .",
    "these results also confirm the results of the 2.5d steady disk wind models of pereyra and collaborators @xcite .",
    "as we develop more realistic models , we aim towards placing stronger constraints on the accretion disk wind scenario , particularly as they apply to qsos .",
    "if the scenario proves tenable , then we may have a well - defined route towards a better understanding of these astronomically fundamental objects .",
