    "charge - density - wave ( cdw ) systems possess a static rearrangement of the charge that is modulated by their ordering vector .",
    "since the underlying ionic cores are charged , they will respond to this charge modulation from the electrons , and often create a distorted lattice structure that follows the modulated charge order of the electrons .",
    "this is often one of the easiest to measure signals of cdw order , namely the distortion of the unit cell due to the ionic displacement that goes hand - in - hand with the electronic charge modulation ; it is more difficult to directly measure the electronic charge modulation in the material .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on signatures of the cdw order that are present in inelastic light scattering experiments on cdw systems .",
    "since inelastic raman scattering is sensitive to different symmetry charge modulations ( when polarizers are used on the incident and scattered light ) , it can provide information about the symmetry of the cdw state which is complementary to the results that would come from an elastic light scattering measurement such as optical reflectivity ( which can measure only one symmetry ) .",
    "similarly , because inelastic x - ray scattering also allows for an exchange of momentum by the scattered photon , we might anticipate interesting behavior to occur when the ordering wave vector and the transferred momentum are the same .",
    "we develop all of the formalism to generalize the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) approach to inelastic raman and x - ray scattering in the situation when there is a cdw phase on a bipartite lattice with an ordering wave vector equal to @xmath4 ; our formulas include all effects of vertex corrections including dynamical screening .",
    "while the formal development , in terms of the green s functions , self - energies , and irreducible vertex functions , is completely general , and can be applied to any many - body model that has cdw order , such as the attractive hubbard model or the holstein model , we analyze the formalism for the specific case of the falicov - kimball model because the irreducible charge vertex is known exactly , and so we can provide an exact solution to the light scattering problem .",
    "in addition to deriving formulas for the light scattering spectra , we also examine the first moment sum rules for these spectra , which are equal to expectation values related to the kinetic and potential energies of the material .",
    "these sum rules can be employed to aid in the data analysis of experiments , when higher - energy bands are well separated from the low energy band that undergoes the cdw order , as already observed in systems that do not have cdw order , like in the normal state of smb@xmath5 at low temperature .",
    "they also provide an alternative way to directly measure the electronic order parameter of the cdw .",
    "we anticipate our results should be relevant to different experimental systems that display charge - density - wave order via nesting on a bipartite lattice at half filling , especially in compounds which are three - dimensional such as@xcite babio@xmath6 and ba@xmath7k@xmath8bio@xmath6 , because dmft is most accurate in higher dimensional systems ; it may also be relevant to some layered two - dimensional systems , at least in a semi - quantitative fashion .",
    "our work also extends recent results on transport and optical conductivity in cdw systems@xcite to the realm of inelastic light scattering . since inelastic light scattering experimental work on cdw systems",
    "has focused on raman scattering of the soft phonon modes , the next step experimentally will likely be to examine the electronic scattering directly ( either with raman or with x - rays ) .",
    "hence this work has the potential to be directly relevant to the next generation of experiments in this area .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the formalism for inelastic light scattering in a symmetry broken phase including explicit expressions for raman scattering , inelastic x - ray scattering , and their first moment sum rules ; this formal development is appropriate for any many - body model of light scattering with local interactions . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our numerical results for the example case of the spinless falicov - kimball model and discuss what signatures are likely to be seen in experiment .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "since cdw ordering is a static order , it is often well described by static models such as the falicov - kimball model.@xcite this model was introduced in 1969 to describe metal - insulator transitions in rare - earth compounds and transition - metal oxides . since then",
    ", it has been studied widely within the dmft community , primarily because it is one of the simplest many - body problems that admits an exact solution@xcite ( for a review see ref .  ) .",
    "the falicov - kimball model has two kinds of particles : mobile electrons and localized electrons .",
    "mobile electrons hop from site to site with a hopping integral between nearest neighbors and they interact with the localized electrons when both sit on the same site ( the interaction energy is @xmath0 ) ; we denote the mobile electron creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath9 by @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and the local electron creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath9 by @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the model has commensurate cdw order at half filling and this is the main property we exploit here .",
    "brandt and mielsch worked out the formalism for calculating the ordered - phase green s functions@xcite shortly after metzner and vollhardt introduced the idea of the many - body problem simplifying in large dimensions.@xcite the cdw order parameter was shown to display anomalous behavior at weak coupling,@xcite and higher - period ordered phases have been examined on the bethe lattice.@xcite transport calculations in the commensurate cdw phase have also appeared recently.@xcite for concreteness , we will focus our attention in the formalism section on the falicov - kimball model , but the light scattering formulas have a wider range of applicability .",
    "the hypercubic lattice is a bipartite lattice , implying that it separates into two sublattices ( called @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) with the hopping being nonzero only between the two sublattices . in this case",
    ", the model will display commensurate ( chessboard ) cdw order when both the light and heavy particles are half - filled .",
    "this cdw order corresponds to the situation where the average filling of the electrons remains uniform on each sublattice , but changes from one sublattice to another ( it is commensurate because the lattice is bipartite here ) .",
    "we begin by writing the falicov - kimball model hamiltonian as the sum of its local and nonlocal parts @xmath16 where @xmath9 and @xmath17 or @xmath15 are the site and sublattice indexes , respectively , and @xmath18 is the hopping matrix , which is nonzero only between different sublattices ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the local hamiltonian is equal to @xmath20 with the number operators of the mobile and localized electrons given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "note that we have introduced different chemical potentials for different sublattices .",
    "this is convenient for computations , because it allows us to work with a fixed order parameter , rather than iterating the dmft equations to determine the order parameter ( which is subject to critical slowing down near @xmath1 ) .",
    "of course , the equilibrium solution occurs when the chemical potential is uniform throughout the system ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "we start with the definition of the lattice green s function @xmath25 / \\mathcal{z } ,    \\\\",

    "the first step of dmft is to scale@xcite the hopping matrix element as @xmath32 ( we use @xmath33 as the unit of energy ) and then take the limit of the infinite dimensions @xmath34 .",
    "the self - energy is then local : @xmath35 and in the case of two sublattices has two values @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "the second step of dmft is to map the lattice green s function onto a local problem by means of the dynamical mean field .",
    "since there are two sublattices , a dynamical mean field @xmath49 is introduced on each of them . as a result ,",
    "the local lattice green s function on each sublattice becomes : @xmath50 the third equation that closes the system of equations for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath49 is obtained from the condition that the local green s function can be defined as the green s function of an impurity with the same dynamical mean field @xmath53 .",
    "such a problem can be exactly solved and the result is equal to @xmath54 this last equation must be modified if one solves a different many - body model such as the hubbard or holstein model , as one needs to solve the relevant impurity problem for the model being considered ; the remainder of the algorithm is identical for other models .",
    "these equations are self - consistently solved numerically .",
    "the iterative dmft algorithm to calculate the lattice green s function is as follows : we analytically continue all of the above formulas to the matsubara frequency axis , because calculations along this axis are much more stable and converge faster than those on the real axis .",
    "then , for a fixed value of the order parameter @xmath55 , one chooses @xmath56 and @xmath57 in such a way that @xmath58 ( @xmath59 for half filling ) . with those fixed quantities ,",
    "we now propose a guess for the self - energy on each sublattice , and then compute the local green s function from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : barz_def ] ) and ( [ eq : g_loc_sublattice ] )",
    ". then we extract the dynamical mean field on each sublattice from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) , and find the local green s function for the impurity from eq .",
    "( [ eq : impurity ] ) .",
    "this value is substituted into eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) to calculate the new self - energy .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the green s function converges and we can calculate the filling of the conduction electrons ; the chemical potential for the conduction electrons is adjusted so that the average conduction electron filling is equal to one half . in order to find the correct equilibrium order parameter @xmath60 at the given temperature ,",
    "one next calculates the chemical potentials for the @xmath61-electrons on each sublattice via @xmath62,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduce the fermionic matsubara frequencies @xmath63 .",
    "if these two chemical potentials are not equal , then the order parameter chosen initially is incorrect , and one needs to repeat the iterative loop with a new @xmath60 to eventually satisfy the equilibrium condition where @xmath64 ; when this condition is satisfied , then @xmath60 is the order parameter at that temperature .",
    "this algorithm , where the order parameter is fixed and we check for equilibrium by examining the chemical potentials , and then update the fixed order parameter to achieve the equilibrium solution , does not suffer from critical slowing down , which does occur if we instead fix the chemical potentials and iterate the equations until they converge .",
    "generically , the dmft equations can be solved with an order of magnitude less computer time than if we use this alternative approach . finally , we repeat this iterative solution on the real axis , with the chemical potentials and fillings fixed at their now known values , which also is much more efficient than trying to do the entire calculation on the real axis . for more complicated models ,",
    "one most likely will need to fix the chemical potential and iterate the equations ( which will be subject to critical slowing down near @xmath1 ) , because one can not solve the impurity problem with a fixed order parameter anymore .",
    "this does not create any serious problems , it just requires more computer time .    in ref .",
    ", we already analyzed the evolution of the dos in the cdw - ordered phase .",
    "we reiterate the main points which will be needed here . at @xmath65 ,",
    "a real gap develops of magnitude @xmath0 with square root singularities at the band edges . as the temperature increases , the system develops substantial subgap dos which are thermally activated within the ordered phase .",
    "plots of the dos can be found in ref .  .",
    "note that the singular behavior occurs for one of the `` inner '' band edges on each sublattice , and that the subgap states develop very rapidly as the temperature rises .",
    "now we develop the formalism for nonresonant light scattering in the cdw phase .",
    "we start from the standard formula for the inelastic light scattering cross section derived by shastry and shraiman@xcite @xmath66 it describes the scattering of band electrons by photons with @xmath67 and @xmath68 being the transferred energy and momentum , respectively , @xmath69 is the polarization of the initial ( final ) states of the photons and @xmath70 denotes the electronic eigenstates . the quantity @xmath71 is called the `` scattering strength '' with @xmath72 .",

    "in this work , we developed the formalism ( within dmft ) to calculate the nonresonant inelastic raman and x - ray scattering in the case when the system develops cdw order at low temperature .",
    "the formalism is a straightforward generalization of the results in the paramagnetic phase , but requires a careful accounting of the different sublattices and how they enter into the diagrammatic expansions , and hence is technically quite challenging .",
    "we also derived first - moment sum rules for these spectra and related the sum rules to different expectation values that can be immediately calculated .",
    "we find that the sum rules relate to the potential energy in some cases , while in other cases , both the kinetic energy and the potential energy terms enter into the expectation values ( and also the cdw order parameter ) .",
    "we applied our formalism to the case of the spinless falicov - kimball model because the charge vertex is known exactly for that system , and hence we can find an exact numerical solution to the light scattering response functions . the main numerical result that we find",
    "is that there is very strong temperature dependence that sets in once we pass through @xmath1 .",
    "this occurs because the system rapidly depletes subgap states as it forms the cdw gap , and then develops a square - root singularity due to the pile - up of states at @xmath65 .",
    "these features can be immediately seen in the light scattering response functions , but are symmetry selective .",
    "when vertex corrections act to screen the light scattering at high temperatures ( near and above @xmath1 ) , the square root singularity is suppressed in the @xmath2 channel , as is the overall magnitude of the light scattering signal . at low temperatures ,",
    "the most important effects are due to nesting of the transferred momentum in bz and due to an effective screening of uniform charge fluctuations which arises due to an averaging effect over the modulated charge distribution of the system .",
    "the qualitative shape of the response function for inelastic x - ray scattering , where the spectra has almost a discontinuous jump near the gap , is an unexpected result , that occurs when one combines the square - root singularity associated with the pile - up of the density of states near the gap edge with the nontrivial nesting effects and the dynamical charge screening effects of the many - body system .",
    "while we see an enhancement of the response , a broadening of the spectra , and an increase in the magnitude of the sum rule as we move from the zone center to the zone corner , we do not see any dramatic changes in the shape of the spectra associated with the fact that we can transfer momenta that is equal to the ordering wave vector of the cdw but we do see a significant overall enhancement of the signal .",
    "this turns out to be similar to what was seen in the dynamical charge susceptibility of the model as one approaches @xmath1 from above@xcite , and may be related to the fact that the falicov - kimball model has a reducible charge vertex that assumes very different behavior for dynamical charge fluctuations as it does for static charge fluctuations , which give rise to the underlying cdw order .",
    "if true , then we would anticipate even larger effects in models where the charge vertex is not decoupled in this fashion , such as the hubbard or holstein model , but resolving this question is a problem for the future .",
    "our numerical work focused on the case of half filling .",
    "one might ask what would happen away from half - filling . while it is true that the cdw phase can be seen as the first ordered phase as we go from the normal state to an ordered state at @xmath1,@xcite we do not know whether the ab ordered phase survives all the way to @xmath65 or whether there are subsequent phase transitions , perhaps to incommensurate phases as @xmath230 is further reduced . for this reason ,",
    "we have not chosen to solve such problems in this work . in the high - temperature phases , where the system is ordered in the ab cdw",
    ", the chemical potential would need to be located outside of the gap , and so we would expect to see more response at low energies , but as the @xmath230 was further lowered , we expect incommensurate order to enter , and for the system to have a well developed gap , so that the results would most likely look similar to those shown here . on the other hand",
    ", there is another possible scenario at low temperatures for some densities of the mobile and localized electrons when , instead of the incommensurate order , the phase separation into chess - board and uniform phases can take place.@xcite in this case the total response will be a sum of the responses for the chess - board and uniform phases weighted by the volume fractions of these phases .",
    "we believe our results will be most relevant to electronic raman or x - ray scattering on cdw ordered systems in three dimensions .",
    "so far , most of the raman scattering work has focused on understanding how phonons behave as one passes through the transition , including the behavior of the phonon softening for the cdw mode@xcite .",
    "we hope that our results will inspire experimental groups to also consider examining electronic raman scattering in cdw systems to see whether they display the kinds of features that we showed here .    in the future",
    ", we will generalize the resonant light scattering formalism to the cdw phase and examine what modifications enter into the response functions in that case .",

    "<S> the dynamical mean - field theory formalism to describe nonresonant inelastic light and x - ray scattering in a charge - density - wave phase is developed and applied to the spinless falicov - kimball model on an infinite - dimensional hypercubic lattice at half filling . at zero temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the charge gap in the density of states is exactly equal to @xmath0 ; increasing the temperature rapidly fills the gap with subgap states . </S>",
    "<S> the nonresonant response function for raman and inelastic x - ray scattering shows peaks connected with transitions over the gap and transitions that involve subgap states ; in addition , the spectra have significant changes in shape as the temperature is raised from zero to @xmath1 . in the case of x - ray scattering ( when both energy and momentum are transferred ) , the response function illustrates features of dynamical screening ( vertex corrections ) in the different ( nonresonant ) symmetry channels ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) ; dynamical screening is also present in the @xmath2 raman signal . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we derive and verify the first moment sum rules for the ( nonresonant ) raman and inelastic x - ray response functions in the charge - density - wave phase and we discuss experimental implications for how the sum rules might be employed in data analysis . </S>"
