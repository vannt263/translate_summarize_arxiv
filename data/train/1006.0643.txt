    "two - point correlators of heavy quarks are very useful objects for extracting parameters of qcd such as , e.g. , the quark masses and the strong coupling constant @xmath14 , both from experiment@xcite and also from the lattice@xcite . however , even our perturbative knowledge of these functions is quite limited due to the complexity of the required diagrammatic calculation .",
    "for instance , in the case of the vector vacuum polarization function , only at @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the analytic result fully known @xcite . at @xmath17 ,",
    "state - of - the - art techniques produce partial answers for this function only in the form of local expansions around three particular values of the external momentum , to wit @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath18 where @xmath2 is the heavy - quark mass .",
    "these correspond to the so - called low - energy expansion , the operator product expansion and the threshold expansion of the correlator .",
    "a phenomenal effort has been devoted to the calculation of an ever - increasing number of coefficients in all of these expansions .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath17 contribution to the vacuum polarization , no less than 30 terms are known from the low - energy expansion @xcite ; although in most of all other situations this number is reduced to just a few @xcite . ideally , of course",
    ", one would like to be able to know the full function ( including its imaginary part ) and , consequently , a strategy has to be devised in order to reconstruct the function from the three expansions , even if this is only approximate .    up to now ,",
    "the method that has been employed in this reconstruction is that of pad approximants @xcite .",
    "pad approximants are ratios of two polynomials whose coefficients are tuned so that they reproduce the taylor expansion in @xmath10 around the origin of a given correlator , to the highest possible degree .",
    "however , even though the vacuum polarization is an analytic function and , therefore , admits a taylor series around @xmath0 , this is not so either at threshold or for @xmath19 due to the presence of non - analytic dependence in the form of square - roots and logarithms of the momentum .",
    "consequently , all by themselves , pad approximants can not approximate the correlator in the full complex plane , unless this nonanalytic dependence is somehow removed . in order to do this ,",
    "a battery of judiciously chosen functions is used for subtracting the nonanalytic dependence on @xmath10 from the original correlator .",
    "pad approximants are then constructed for the subtracted correlator , rather than for the correlator itself . as pointed out in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite this procedure has a certain degree of arbitrariness .",
    "this ambiguity in the procedure can potentially be the source of a systematic uncertainty , and it is important that this uncertainty be quantified .",
    "normally , this is attempted by varying among several of the choices made in the aforementioned pad construction .",
    "the results obtained with the pad method are certainly interesting but , as higher and higher precision is always in demand , we think it is also interesting that one could devise alternative methods which could confirm ( or if need be , modify ) these results .    therefore",
    ", we think it would be desirable to have an alternative procedure which could reconstruct the full function from the three expansions in an unambiguous way , and with which we could have a better handle on the possible systematic uncertainties involved . in this paper",
    "we will present what we believe to be one such method . furthermore , unlike pads which are essentially numerical , our reconstruction is totally analytic .",
    "the main observation is that , in the conformal variable @xmath7 in which the @xmath10 cut complex plane is mapped onto a unit disk , the coefficients of the threshold expansion and the ope determine the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients of the low - energy expansion .",
    "this property is easiest to recognize in the language of mellin transforms , thanks to a mathematical result which is known as the converse mapping theorem @xcite .",
    "an intuitive way to understand this is the following .",
    "a finite set of taylor coefficients knows nothing about the region of analyticity of the function .",
    "so , for example , even if you know a thousand taylor coefficients , strictly speaking , you still do not know the value for the radius of convergence .",
    "the reason is because the radius of convergence is a limit procedure and things can change completely from the coefficient a thousand and 1 onwards .",
    "since the region of analyticity knows about the asymptotic tail of the taylor coefficients , it is not strange that by giving precise information on the properties of the function at the boundary of this region of analyticity ( i.e. the threshold expansion and the ope ) one may gather information on this asymptotic tail of the taylor coefficients .",
    "how to make this statement useful beyond just words , is what we have tried to do in this work .    as it turns out , the asymptotic behavior of the low - energy coefficients sets in so quickly that already for the second or the third coefficient it is a good approximation .",
    "this results in an efficient way to compute them .",
    "once all the taylor coefficients are known ( even if only approximately ) one can resum them and reconstruct the full function . as we will see",
    ", this resummation expresses the result for the full function as a unique combination of polylogarithms ( and derivatives thereof ) plus a known polynomial .",
    "although we have set up the problem within the context of a two - point correlator of a heavy quark , we think that the method we have developed can be of more general use , and could be applied also in other contexts where several expansions to a function with a given analytic structure are known .",
    "mellin transforms have also proven very useful in other contexts in perturbative calculations @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we will set up the necessary definitions and describe in detail our method and the relevant mathematical results it is based on . in section 3 , we will test the method with the case of the @xmath17 vacuum polarization function which , although not fully known analytically , is sufficiently known to allow interesting nontrivial checks . in particular , since 30 low - energy coefficients have been calculated up to now @xcite , we will be able to compare our prediction for them with their exact value . in section 4",
    ", we will apply the method to the @xmath20 vacuum polarization function , for which only a few terms in the low - energy , threshold expansion and ope have been calculated @xcite .",
    "we will reconstruct the full function , make again predictions for the coefficients of its low - energy expansion , and compare them with those already present in the literature .",
    "the final section will be devoted to some conclusions and outlook .",
    "finally , in the appendix , we compare our approximation to the exact result in the case of a known function , choosing the result at @xmath15 as an illustrative example .",
    "let @xmath21 be a function of the complex variable @xmath22 with the following properties :    * it is analytic in the disc @xmath23 where , consequently , it admits a convergent expansion when @xmath24 as + @xmath25 + which , from now on , we will call the `` taylor '' expansion .",

    "we will refer to this expansion as the `` ope '' .",
    "the problem we are trying to solve is how to reconstruct the function @xmath33 which matches onto the above three expansions in the corresponding regions , in an analytic and systematic way . that this is possible is already guaranteed by the taylor expansion ( which is convergent ) and the theorem on analytic continuation",
    ". however , an exact reconstruction requires complete knowledge of the infinite set of coefficients @xmath34 . realistically speaking ,",
    "this type of information is certainly not available .",
    "when only a finite number of @xmath34 s is known , one clearly has no other option but to resort to the ope and threshold expansions to try to reconstruct the original function @xmath33 .",
    "it seems reasonable to imagine that the more terms one knows , the better one will be able to determine this function .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , a concrete method to analytically reconstruct @xmath33 is not available in the literature .",
    "therefore , we would like to explain how one can do this reconstruction in an analytic and systematic way .",
    "this we will do with the help of the mellin transform , using the vector two - point correlator for a heavy quark as an example , and illustrating how the method works in practice .",
    "let us recall the definition of the vacuum polarization function @xmath35 through the correlator of two electromagnetic currents @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a heavy quark , @xmath38 and where @xmath39 is the external four - momentum . in qcd perturbation theory ,",
    "@xmath35 may be decomposed to @xmath40 as @xmath41 for definiteness , @xmath14 denotes the strong coupling constant in the @xmath42 scheme at the scale @xmath43 , but the precise definition is not important for the discussion which follows .",
    "equation ( [ pi ] ) will be understood in the on - shell normalization scheme where a subtraction at zero momentum has been made in such a way as to guarantee that @xmath44 . as it is well known , the vacuum polarization in eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) satisfies a once subtracted dispersion relation , i.e. @xmath45 when massless cuts are disregarded ( as we will assume henceforth ) , the spectral function in ( [ disprel ] ) starts at @xmath46 , where @xmath2 is the heavy quark pole mass . in this case",
    ", the function @xmath47 may be expanded for @xmath48 in powers of @xmath49 and it admits a taylor expansion , exactly as in eq .",
    "( [ taylorpi ] ) .",

    "however , one can find the connection between the two sets of coefficients @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ taylorpi ] ) and @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ taylorpiw ] ) .",
    "they read    @xmath69    as we will now see , the coefficients @xmath70 in ( [ thresholdpiw ] ) determine the behavior of @xmath6 for large values of @xmath8 .",
    "in order to see this , it is very convenient to redefine the conformal variable @xmath7 as @xmath71 the limit @xmath72 with the `` @xmath73 '' sign corresponds to the threshold expansion , whereas the `` @xmath74 '' sign corresponds to the ope .",
    "then , one can make use of the integral representation @xmath75 where the integral on the righthand side term runs over a straight line in the @xmath76 complex plane , with @xmath77 any constant real number , @xmath78 .",
    "the second identity allows one to express the vacuum polarization function ( [ taylorpiw ] ) as an inverse mellin transform in the @xmath79 variable as @xmath80 in this expression the integration path is a vertical line in the @xmath76 complex plane located at @xmath81 , within the region of full analyticity of the integrand .",
    "this region is usually called `` the fundamental strip '' .",
    "the usefulness of the expression ( [ mellinpit ] ) for our purposes is due to a relatively recent mathematical theorem , known as the _ converse mapping theorem _ @xcite , which assures that the @xmath72 behavior of the function @xmath82 is completely determined by the singularities in the @xmath76 complex plane of the function appearing in the integrand of ( [ mellinpit ] ) , i.e. @xmath83 furthermore , these singularities are just limited to isolated poles , i.e. the above combination @xmath84 is a meromorphic function . in general , the converse mapping theorem establishes the following dictionary @xcite between a given function @xmath85 and its mellin transform @xmath86(s ) $ ] : @xmath87(s ) & = \\int_0^\\infty\\ ! dt \\ ; t^{s-1 } \\ ; f(t ) & \\rightleftharpoons   & & f(t ) & = \\int \\limits_{c- i   \\infty}^{c+ i   \\infty } \\ !",

    "in particular , we would like to call the reader s attention to the result shown in eq .",
    "( [ dict2 ] ) , which says that the expansion of the function at @xmath72 is given by the pole @xmath30 ( together with its multiplicity @xmath29 ) , and the residue @xmath89 , of its mellin transform .",

    "this is very important since it means that the function @xmath92 admits an expansion in powers of @xmath9 for @xmath8 large .",

    "( [ mellinpit ] ) , one sees that one goes from the threshold expansion to the ope by the addition of the alternating sign in the definition of the function @xmath90 .",
