    "interacting galaxies like the antennae ( ngc  4038/4039 ; whitmore & schweizer 1995 ) or stephan s quintet ( hcg  92 ; hunsberger 1997 ) show much star - burst activity in their tidal features .",
    "high resolution images from the hst resolve these regions into many compact groups of young massive star clusters ( i.e. super - clusters ) and/or tidal - tail dwarf galaxies , with typical radii of 100500  pc . here",
    "we aim to study the future fate of these super - clusters .",
    "+ we begin with an overview of the numerical method and explain the setup of our simulations .",
    "we then show results obtained so far and conclude with an outlook on future work we intend to pursue .",
    "_ superbox _ is a hierarchical particle - mesh code with high - resolution sub - grids focusing on the cores and the star - clusters as a whole , and moving with them through the simulation area ( fellhauer et al .",
    "the code has , for particle - mesh codes , a highly - accurate force - calculation based on a nearest grid - point ( ngp ) scheme .",
    "the main advantages of _ superbox _ are it s speed and the low memory requirement which makes it possible to use a high particle number with high grid - resolution on normal desktop computers .",
    "as a model for our massive star - clusters we use , for each , plummer - spheres with 100,000 particles , a plummer - radius @xmath0  pc and a cutoff radius @xmath1  pc , giving a total mass of @xmath2 and crossing time of @xmath3  myrs .",
    "twenty of these clusters are placed in a compact group orbiting in a logarithmic potential of the parent galaxy , @xmath4 with @xmath5  kpc and @xmath6  km / s . the case",
    "@xmath7 is dealt with in kroupa ( 1998 ) .",
    "the distribution of the super - cluster is also plummer - like with different plummer - radii ( table  1 ) .",
    "the tidal radius is @xmath8 2.4  kpc at apo - galacticon and 1.2 kpc at peri - galacticon .",
    "the orbits have the same eccentricity in all cases , and begin at apo - galacticon ( @xmath9  kpc , @xmath10 ) with @xmath11  km / s ( @xmath12 ) .    c|r|r simulation & scale - length & @xmath13 + run6 & 300 pc & 108.4 myr + run5 & 150 pc & 38.3 myr + run7 & 75 pc & 13.5 myr +    [ tab : runs ]",
    "in all runs some of the clusters merge very rapidly within the first @xmath14  myrs as seen in fig .  1 .    the number of surviving clusters drops with increasing concentration of the super - cluster ( sc ) .",
    "the orbits of the clusters inside their super - cluster also change rapidly due to the very short relaxation - time of the sc ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "thereafter the merger - object and the surviving clusters move on epicycles around the orbit of the original sc about the galactic centre , with an increasing amplitude and period due to tidal heating ( fig  2 ) .",
    "the surviving star - clusters remain in the vicinity of the merger - object ( fig .",
    "in the intermediate concentration case ( run5 ) we find 2 merger - objects . to check whether this was just a chance event , a second run with a different random number seed for the star - cluster positions also gave 2 objects .",
    "interesting in this context is that theis ( 1996 ) found that two clusters form in a cold collapse of a stellar system in an external tidal field .",
    "violent relaxation in an external tidal field needs further addressing in the present context .      in those cases where the sc has a low concentration",
    "initially , the resulting merger - system is an extended object ( several kpc ) with a low density and an off - centre nucleus ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "the radial density profile follows an exponential distribution ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the velocity - dispersion in these objects drops to @xmath8 5  km / s ( fig .  5 ) , which is comparable with the measured dispersions of dsph - galaxies in the milky way , and is slightly anisotropic .",
    "in the case of the most concentrated sc , the merger - object is a dense compact spheroidal object ( fig .",
    "3 ) with a high density core ( @xmath16 ) . the density profile follows a power - law with @xmath17 out to 0.8 - 1.0  kpc ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the velocity - dispersion of this spheroidal dwarf galaxy is anisotropic and around 15  km / s ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "it has a half - mass radius of about 300  pc .",
    "the size of this object is too large in comparison with even the biggest of the globular clusters , and the central density is far too high to be comparable with any de- , dirr- or dsph - galaxy .",
    "however , it has properties similar to the initial satellites studied by kroupa ( 1997 ) , and is thus likely to evolve to a dsph - like satellite . but",
    "further investigation of this issue is necessary .",
    "we found that even if new high resolution images show that most of the so - called tidal dwarf galaxies are clusters of young compact massive star clusters they are likely to merge within a short time - scale .",
    "the properties of the merger - objects differ with the scale - length of their initial distribution .",
    "we found large fluffy objects with similar properties as the local dsph - galaxies as well as very compact and massive spheroidal objects , which , however , may be similar to the progenitors of some of the local present - day dsph satellites .",
    "+ in the course of future work we intend to investigate the influence of the choice of orbit around the parent galaxy and how this alters the results .",
    "we will focus on the transition between bound and unbound objects , and look for a region in the space of parameters where 2 merger - objects ( binary system ) are more likely to form .",
    "our further research will also address the future fate of the merger - objects and their possible counterparts in reality .",

    "what do you expect to happen with the merged clusters that you compared to a dsph .",
    "is nt it bound to sink into the core of the merger remnant by dynamical friction ?",
    "the bulk of the yscs is at @xmath18  kpc from the nucleus of ngc  4038 , i.e. not further away than ngc  4039 ( nucleus ) ! +",
    "* answer * : we assume that at least some of the tidal - tail dwarfs seen to form in outer ( @xmath19  kpc ) tidal arms are composed of clusters of young massive star clusters . for our models we use an analytic galactic potential , because in the mass range of the merger - object of about @xmath20  m@xmath21 , dynamical friction does not play a significant role . + * e. grebel * : could you comment on how the merged clusters will resemble a dsph galaxy in their properties ( e.g. dsph do nt show rotation , have very low density and surface brightness , etc . ) ? + * answer * : it is too early to quantify the reply in detail , but we expect the merged object to show properties that could make it look similar to the progenitors of some of the dsph satellites .",
    "the merged object is spheroidal , and has a high specific frequency of globular clusters , and low angular momentum , which however depends on the initial conditions .",
    "it s stellar population contains stars from the mother galaxy , as well as stars formed during the star burst , and maybe stars ( and clusters ) formed during a possible later accretion event of a co - moving gas cloud .",
    "many of these issues are discussed in kroupa ( 1998 ) . + * j. gallagher * ( comment ) : since super - star - clusters are often born in groups ",
    "the luminous clumps  destruction via cluster merging is of general interest .",
    "for example , if this process reduces the survival rate of massive - star - clusters , it might help to explain why intermediate age examples seem to be rare .",
    "+ * d. mclaughlin * : what evidence is there that the clustered clusters in the antennae will actually merge ?",
    "there are @xmath22  m@xmath21 clouds of gas in this system , so it may be that young clusters are clustered because several form in any given cloud , but they disperse after gas - loss . with no information on either the cluster - cluster velocity dispersion or the time when the parent cloud was disrupted , it would be difficult to rule out this possibility . + * answer * : this is an important issue , and very similar to the problem of forming bound star clusters . while not disproving rapid dispersal entirely , the argument which makes rapid dispersal less likely is as follows : the cluster - cluster velocity dispersion , @xmath23 is either small , which will lead to a bound merger object .",
    "if @xmath23 is near to virial for the _ stellar _ mass in the super - cluster , then our models take care of that . if , however , @xmath23 is virial for the stars and a much larger mass in gas , then @xmath24  km / s assuming a star - formation efficiency of 20  per cent and a pre - gas removal super - cluster configuration as in run5 here .",
    "thus , within 10  myr , the object will have expanded to a radius of at least 350  pc .",
    "since many of the super - clusters are still very concentrated , and about 10  myr old , rapid expansion does not appear to be taking place , especially so since there are at least about 10  observed super clusters and they would have had to start in unrealistically concentrated configurations for them to appear with the sizes they have now .",
    "this is further discussed in ( kroupa 1998 ) ."
