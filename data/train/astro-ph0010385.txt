    "in recent years , it has been suggested that a population of large carbonaceous molecules , such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) and fullerene compounds could play a significant role in the physics and chemistry of interstellar and circumstellar environments .",
    "these molecules have been proposed as the sources of the broad infrared emission features ( duley & williams 1981 , lger & puget 1984 , allamandola , tielens & barker 1985 ) and of the diffuse interstellar absorption bands ( lger & dhendecourt 1985 , van der zwet & allamandola 1985 , crawford , tielens & allamandola 1985 ) .",
    "pahs would represent the most abundant molecules in the interstellar medium after h@xmath0 and co ( lger & dhendecourt 1985 ) .",
    "they could exist under various charge and hydrogenation states depending on local conditions ( density , uv flux ... ) .",
    "environment studies of some dibs suggest carriers with ionization potential of 10 - 13  ev such as pah cations ( cami et al .",
    "1997 , sonnentrucker et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to propose a description of the abundance of different hydrogenation states for some small and medium pahs @xmath1 50c under the physical conditions present in the interstellar medium , especially in diffuse environments where uv photons strongly influence the dissociation of pahs .",
    "we first compare the effect of physical processes involving pah cations and find the balance dominated by photo - dissociation and hydrogenation processes .",
    "then we calculate the distribution of hydrogenation states for representative pah cations .",
    "we discuss here the processes involving pahs in diffuse interstellar clouds .",
    "there are four main processes in competition : photo - dissociation following the absorption of uv photons , photo - ionization , electronic recombination and reactions between pah cations and h or h@xmath0 .",
    "photo - dissociation takes place when the photon absorbed by the molecule has a sufficient energy to dissociate the molecule .",
    "we only take into account the dissociation of a h or h@xmath0 of pah cations .    after an uv photon",
    "is absorbed , the pah cation is either dissociated , or stabilized by the emission of ir photons .",
    "the uv photon energy is distributed on all vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule . when the energy accumulated in a vibration mode becomes comparable to the c@xmath2h dissociation energy ( @xmath3 4 ev for pah cations ) , the molecule dissociates .",
    "photo - dissociation studies are often analysed using statistical models like the rrkm ( rice - ramsperger - kassel - marcus ) theory , where one supposes the excited molecule is quickly relaxed into the electronic fondamental state by internal conversion . here",
    ", we use the photo - dissociation rates calculated by allain et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( cf .",
    "table 1 )      according to le page ( private communication ) , for small pah cations , the hydrogen addition rate might be proportional to that of benzene multiplied by the ratio between the number of reactive c and the total number of c. the reactive c atoms have one bond with a h. the addition rates for some small pah cations are given in table 1 .",
    "the reaction rate between an ion and a neutral can be estimated by the langevin rate ( @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 s@xmath6 ) which is larger than the kinetic reaction rate between two neutrals ( @xmath3 10@xmath7 @xmath5 s@xmath6 ) .",
    "as we can see in the figures 2 , three phases exist for each hydrogenation state of pahs except for pahs @xmath8 40c .",
    "the uv intensity is assumed to be constant while the h density varies . at low density ,",
    "pah cations are completely or strongly dehydrogenated but at high density , they are normally hydrogenated . at intermediate density , pah cations are partially dehydrogenated .    for pah cations",
    "@xmath9 50c , the completely hydrogenated state is favored ( cf .",
    "fig.[pah50]d ) .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that large molecules have more degrees of freedom available to store the excess energy brought by the uv photon , which decreases the photodissociation rate .",
    "small pahs @xmath10 30c will be difficult to search because their abundance is distributed over a number of hydrogenation states .",
    "their superimposed absorptions can contribute to the envelope of quasi continuum extinction in addition to dust due to a large number of states and isomers .",
    "pahs @xmath8 40c are stable and fully hydrogenated .",
    "their signature can be searched in the fundamental band transition expected in the far red and near infra - red around 1 @xmath11 m ( foing & ehrenfreund 1994 ) .",
    "rotational contours for such pah @xmath8 40c would lead to fwhm broadening of 2 - 4 cm@xmath6 depending on the exact size and geometry of the molecule ( ehrenfreund & foing 1996 ) .",
    "these transitions can be searched in near ir surveys of dibs .",
    "laboratory spectroscopy and dissociation and hydrogenation rates are also needed for guiding the search for pahs in space ."
