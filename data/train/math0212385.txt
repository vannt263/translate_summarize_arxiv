    "the fundamental group of complements of plane curves is a very important topological invariant with many different applications .",
    "there are two such invariants : the _ affine fundamental group _ of a plane curve , which is the fundamental group of its affine complement , and its _ projective fundamental group _ , which is the fundamental group of its projective complement .",
    "oka @xcite has proved the following interesting result , which shed new light on the connection between these two fundamental groups :    [ oka ] let @xmath0 be a curve in @xmath1 and let @xmath2 be a general line to @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath2 intersects @xmath0 in only simple points .",
    "then , we have a central extension : @xmath3    since @xmath2 is a general line to @xmath0 , then : @xmath4 hence , we get the following interesting connection between the two fundamental groups : @xmath5    a natural question is :    under which conditions does this short exact sequence split ?",
    "notice that when it does , we have the following decomposition : @xmath6    a _ real line arrangement _ in @xmath7 is a finite union of copies of @xmath8 in @xmath7 , whose equations can be written by real coefficients .",
    "some families of real line arrangements were already proved to satisfy this condition , see @xcite .    here , we show that :    [ main ] if @xmath9 is a real line arrangement , then such a decomposition holds : @xmath10",
    "actually , one can see that the same argument holds for arbitrary line arrangements ( see theorem [ complex_la ] ) .",
    "moreover , we give a different condition for this decomposition to hold : if @xmath0 is a plane curve with a line component , i.e. @xmath11 where @xmath2 is a line , we have that @xmath12 too .",
    "these results can be applied to the computation of the affine fundamental groups of line arrangements , since the projective fundamental group is an easier object to deal with than the affine fundamental group .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ proof ]",
    "we prove theorem [ main ] .",
    "the other condition is discussed in section [ fg ] , and in the last section we give some applications .",
    "in this section , we prove theorem [ main ] .",
    "let @xmath9 be a real line arrangement with @xmath13 lines .",
    "let @xmath2 be an arbitrary line which intersects @xmath9 transversally . by the following remark",
    ", one can reduce the proof to the case where @xmath2 is a line which intersects transversally all the lines in @xmath9 and all the intersection points of @xmath2 with lines in @xmath9 are to the left of all the intersection points of @xmath9 ( see figure [ arrangement ] for such an example , where the arrangement @xmath9 consists of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "[ line_infty ] we have proved in @xcite that in a real line arrangement , if a line crosses a multiple intersection point from one side to its other side ( see figure [ pass_mul ] ) , the fundamental groups remain unchanged ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.13 ) for this property of the action @xmath16 ) .    by this argument",
    ", we can start with any transversal line @xmath2 as `` the line at infinity '' .",
    "then , by using this property repeatedly , we can push this line over all the intersection points of the arrangement @xmath9 , without changing the corresponding fundamental group .",
    "this process will be terminated when all the intersection points of @xmath2 with @xmath9 are placed to the left of all the intersection points of @xmath9 , and this is the reduced case .    by this remark",
    ", we continue the proof of theorem [ main ] for the reduced case , where all the intersection points of @xmath2 with @xmath9 are placed to the left of all the intersection points of @xmath9 .",
    "we compute presentations for @xmath17 and @xmath18 by braid monodromy techniques ( the moishezon - teicher algorithm ) and the van kampen theorem .",
    "the original techniques are introduced in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "shorter presentations of these techniques can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we first have to compute the lists of lefschetz pairs of the arrangements , which are the pairs of indices of the components intersected at the intersection point , where we numerate the components locally near the point ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath9 is an arbitrary real line arrangement , its list of lefschetz pairs is @xmath19 , \\cdots , [ a_k , b_k]),\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the number of intersection points in @xmath9 .",
    "if we assume that the additional line @xmath2 crosses all the lines of @xmath9 transversally to the left of all the intersection points in @xmath9 , the list of lefschetz pairs of @xmath21 is @xmath19 , \\cdots , [ a_k , b_k],[n , n+1 ] , \\cdots , [ 1,2])\\ ] ]    by the braid monodromy techniques and the van kampen theorem , the group @xmath17 has @xmath13 generators @xmath22 and @xmath18 has @xmath23 generators @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , the first @xmath20 relations of @xmath18 are equal to the @xmath20 relations of @xmath17 .",
    "let us denote this set of relations by @xmath25 .",
    "now , we have to find out the relations induced by the @xmath13 intersection points of the line @xmath2 with the arrangement @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , we have to add at last the appropriate projective relations .    first , we compute the relations induced by the @xmath13 intersection points of the line @xmath2 with the arrangement @xmath9 .",
    "the lefschetz pair of the @xmath26th point ( which is the first intersection point of @xmath2 with @xmath9 ) is @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "hence , its corresponding initial skeleton is shown in figure [ init_skel_k_1 ] .    since the list of pairs @xmath28 , \\cdots , [ a_k , b_k]$ ] is induced by a line arrangement , it is easy to see that : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the generalized half - twist on the segment @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "therefore , applying this braid on the initial skeleton yields the resulting skeleton for this point which is presented in figure [ final_skel_k_1 ] .    by the van kampen theorem ,",
    "the corresponding relation is : @xmath32 = 1\\ ] ]    let @xmath33 be the @xmath34th intersection point , where @xmath35 .",
    "its corresponding lefschetz pair is @xmath36 $ ] , and hence its initial skeleton is shown in figure [ init_skel_k_i ] .",
    "now , we first have to apply on it the following braid : @xmath37 and afterwards we have to apply on the resulting skeleton @xmath30 , which equals to @xmath38 as before .",
    "hence , figure [ final_skel_k_i ] presents the resulting skeleton for the @xmath34th point .",
    "again , by the van kampen theorem , the corresponding relation is : @xmath39 = 1\\ ] ] to summarize , we get that the set of relations induced by the intersection points of the additional line @xmath2 is : @xmath40 = 1 \\quad | \\quad 1 \\leq i - k \\leq n \\}\\ ] ] one can easily see , by a sequence of substitutions , that actually this set of relations is equal to the following set : @xmath41 = 1 \\quad | \\quad 1 \\leq i \\leq n \\}\\ ] ]    hence , we have the following presentations :    @xmath42 @xmath43=1\\ , \\ 1 \\leq i \\leq n\\ ; \\\\   & x_{n+1 } x_n \\cdots x_1=1 \\end{array } \\right\\rangle\\ ] ]    it remains to show that these presentations imply that : @xmath44    denote by @xmath45 the set of relations @xmath25 after we substitute anywhere the generator @xmath46 by an element @xmath47 in the corresponding group .",
    "hence , using the projective relations in both fundamental groups , we have the following new presentations : @xmath48 @xmath49=1 , 2 \\leq i \\leq n    \\end{array } \\right\\rangle\\ ] ]    since all the relations in @xmath25 are either commutative relations or cyclic relations of the type @xmath50 where @xmath51 are words in the generators @xmath52 , then the sum of powers of the generator @xmath46 or its inverse are equal in any part of the relation .",
    "hence , using the fact that @xmath53 commutes with all the other generators , we actually can cancel @xmath53 from the set of relations @xmath54 and therefore we have : @xmath55    by this argument , we now have : @xmath56=1 , 2 \\leq i \\leq n   \\end{array } \\right\\rangle \\\\   & \\cong &   \\left\\langle   \\begin{array}{c|c } x_2,\\cdots , x_n , x_{n+1 } &   \\cr(x_1 \\leftarrow x_2^{-1 } \\cdots x_n^{-1});\\\\   & [ x_i , x_{n+1}]=1 , 2 \\leq",
    "i \\leq n    \\end{array } \\right\\rangle \\\\   & \\cong & \\langle x_2,\\cdots , x_n \\quad | \\quad \\cr(x_1 \\leftarrow x_2^{-1 } \\cdots x_n^{-1})\\rangle \\oplus \\langle x_{n+1 } \\rangle \\\\   & \\cong & \\pi_1(\\c\\p^2-\\cl ) \\oplus \\z   \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since @xmath2 is transversal to @xmath9 , this is equivalent to : @xmath57 and we are done .    by the projective relation in @xmath58",
    ", we have that : @xmath59 hence , we have that the element which corresponds to the loop around all the lines is a central element in @xmath60 , as was shown by oka @xcite too .",
    "now , one can see that a similar argument holds for complex line arrangements too .",
    "hence , one has the following generalization :    [ complex_la ] let @xmath9 be an arbitrary line arrangement .",
    "then the following decomposition holds : @xmath10",
    "in this section we will show that the decomposition holds for any reducible curve with a line component .",
    "oka and sakamoto @xcite have proved the following decomposition theorem concerning the affine fundamental group :    [ os ] let @xmath61 and @xmath62 be algebraic plane curves in @xmath63 .",
    "assume that the intersection @xmath64 consists of distinct @xmath65 points , where @xmath66 are the respective degrees of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "then : @xmath67    here is a parallel version for the projective fundamental group :    let @xmath61 and @xmath62 be plane curves in @xmath1 with respective degrees @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath70 be the affine part of @xmath71 with respect to a projective line @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath72 consists of @xmath73 distinct simple points , then : @xmath74",
    "when @xmath2 becomes the line at infinity , the curve @xmath75 becomes @xmath76 . also , it is easy to see that if @xmath77 denotes the affine part of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath2 , then @xmath78    now , we can compute : @xmath79}}{\\cong } & \\pi _ 1 ( \\c ^2-c_1 ' ) \\oplus \\pi _",
    "1(\\c ^2-    c_2 ' ) \\nonumber \\\\      & \\cong & \\pi _ 1(\\c\\p ^2- ( c_1 \\cup l ) ) \\oplus \\pi _",
    "1(\\c\\p ^2-(c_2 \\cup l ) )    \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hence , we get :    let @xmath0 be a plane curve of degree @xmath80 in @xmath1 and let @xmath81 be a line arrangement consisting of @xmath20 lines meeting in a point outside @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath2 be an additional line which intersects both @xmath0 and @xmath81 transversally .",
    "if @xmath82 consists of @xmath83 distinct simple points , then : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the free group with @xmath20 generators .",
    "in particular , if @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath81 consists of one line @xmath87 , then : @xmath88    substituting @xmath0 instead of @xmath61 and @xmath81 instead of @xmath62 in the last lemma , yields the following equation : @xmath89 since @xmath90 ( see for example @xcite ) , the corollary is proved .",
    "fixing @xmath86 yields the particular case .",
    "hence we got the following result :    [ line_component ] let @xmath0 be a plane curve with a line component , i.e. @xmath11 where @xmath2 is a line that intersects @xmath77 transversally .",
    "then : @xmath91    using the case @xmath86 in the last corollary , we get that : @xmath92 but since @xmath87 intersects @xmath93 transversally , we have that @xmath94 so we get : @xmath95    by a similar argument to the argument we have used to prove theorem [ main ] , and by the fact that the line at infinity is transversal to @xmath96 , we can generalize proposition [ line_component ] to the case that @xmath2 does not have to be transversal to @xmath0 .",
    "in this section , we present some immediate applications of the main result .      fan @xcite proved the following result :    let @xmath97 be an arrangement of @xmath13 lines and @xmath98 be the set of all singularities of @xmath97 with multiplicity @xmath99 .",
    "suppose that the subgraph of @xmath97 , which contains only the higher singularities ( i.e. with multiplicity @xmath100 ) and their edges , is a union of trees .",
    "then : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the multiplicity of the intersection point @xmath104 .",
    "using theorem [ main ] , we have the following easy consequence :    under the same conditions of the last proposition , we have that : @xmath105 where @xmath102 .",
    "this generalizes theorem 5.3 of @xcite .      in @xcite and @xcite we address the following question about the invariants of real arrangements :    does the incidence lattice determine the affine fundamental group and the projective fundamental group of real line arrangements ?    for complex line arrangements , the answer for",
    "this question is negative due to an example of rybnikov ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our main result is ( see @xcite ) :    for real line arrangements with up to @xmath106 lines , the incidence lattice does determine the affine fundamental group and the projective fundamental group .    by theorem [ main ]",
    ", we actually reduce this question to the projective case only , since we have :    let @xmath107 and @xmath108 be two real line arrangements such that : @xmath109 then : @xmath110    this simplifies much the computational aspect of this question , since during the computations we have performed in @xcite , it was turned out that the comparison of two projective fundamental groups was much easier than the comparison of the corresponding affine fundamental groups .",
    "the main reason for this difference is probably that the affine fundamental group has one more generator than the projective fundamental group ( this generator is cancelled by the projective relation which implies that the multiplication of all the generators is the unit element ) .",
