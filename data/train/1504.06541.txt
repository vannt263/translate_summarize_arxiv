    "in the advent of intelligent vehicle information networks @xcite , the smart power grid @xcite , and the internet of things ( _ iot _ ) @xcite , current infrastructure is becoming increasingly dependent on cyber networks .",
    "this dependency makes current infrastructure a larger more attractive target for cyberattacks , such that the national security agency ( nsa ) director stated the u.s . power grid could be shut down with a cyberattack  @xcite .",
    "secure communication channels are needed to prevent eavesdropping or intervention .",
    "increasingly though , communications is directed away from expensive , dedicated networks in favor of the open internet . in order to ensure secure communications ,",
    "security keys are needed to set up a secure communication .",
    "the keys are generated , and shared via a publicly accessible channel by secure key distribution protocols .",
    "consider a secure key exchange between alice and bob , alice and bob must consider that an eavesdropper ( eve ) is trying to extract the key as illustrated in figure  [ fig : alice_bob ]",
    ". secure key exchanges can be categorized as either software - based or hardware - based .",
    "software - based key exchanges are based on mathematical algorithms with the assumption that eve does not have enough computing resources to crack the key .",
    "in essence , software - based key exchanges offer no security from an information theoretical point of view .",
    "the security is only ( computationally- ) conditional and is not _ future - proof _ , meaning that with enough computing resources the key can be extracted .",
    "the advantages of software - based key exchanges are the low cost , hardware communicator is not required , and the keys can be exchanged over the internet , thus eliminating the need of extra infrastructure .",
    "the other option is hardware - based key exchange , these offer an advantage of unconditional security .      the quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite and the kirchhoff - law - johnson - noise ( kljn ) @xcite secure key exchange are two examples of hardware - based secure key exchange concepts that are information theoretically secure @xcite .",
    "thus even with infinite computing resources the key will not be extracted by eve , because the security offered by these schemes are based on fundamental laws of physics , to crack the key exchange would require eve to break the underpinning laws of physics .",
    "the main disadvantage of hardware - based key exchanges is the higher cost , as they require a physical communicator at each host , and a dedicated connection between communicators .",
    "such communication schemes can be considered peer - to - peer ( p2p ) @xcite .",
    "the qkd key exchange utilizes the quantum no - cloning theorem of quantum mechanics @xcite to distribute key bits . in theory",
    "it is information theoretically secure , however the physical implementation of qkd has been debated and the method has been hacked @xcite .",
    "the kljn key exchange utilizes the laws and properties of classical mechanics @xcite to generate and distribute key bits . in the kljn key exchange depicted in figure  [ fig : kljn_sys ] , alice and bob have two identical resistor pairs , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( the values of the resistors are such that @xmath0 < @xmath1 ) which represents the low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 bits respectively . at the beginning of each bit exchange period",
    ", the communicators randomly generate a bit value and connect the corresponding resistor to the wire line .",
    "the effective value of the resulting thermal noise in the cable has three possible levels .",
    "when it is at the intermediate level , alice and bob will know that the other party has the opposite bit value than their own .",
    "thus a secure bit exchange took place because eve , while she also knows that alice and bob have opposite bit values , she does not know who has the @xmath0 value and who has the @xmath1 value @xcite .",
    "hardware - based key exchanges require p2p networks with a dedicated connection to each host .",
    "for very large networks this will be costly due to the infrastructure ( cables ) and key exchangers .",
    "the cost complexity of the growth for different networks can be denoted by @xmath2 for number of cables , @xmath3 for number of key exchangers , and @xmath4 for amount of time required or speed to complete a secure bit exchange , with @xmath5 representing the number of hosts in the network .",
    "a simple method to construct p2p networks is a fully connected network also known as the complete graph in graph theory .",
    "the fully connected network is illustrated in figure  [ fig : bf1 ] .",
    "the fully connected network does not require a protocol since every host in the network has a dedicated connection with every other host in the network , and can process a secure bit exchange with any other host at any time simultaneously .",
    "this network has @xmath6 key exchangers per host and scales with the order of @xmath7 for cables and key exchangers , which makes this network impractical for very large networks .",
    "the complexities are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "we will denote the fully connected network with @xmath6 key exchangers per host as @xmath11 .",
    "the fully connected network has @xmath6 key exchangers for every host resulting in @xmath12 total key exchangers for the entire network , @xmath6 direct connections for every host resulting in @xmath13 total cables for the entire network .",
    "the advantage the fully connected network has is time , as every host in the network can simultaneously process a secure bit exchange with every other host in the network .",
    "if the cost of having @xmath12 key exchangers for the entire network is too costly , then a trade - off between the number of key exchangers and speed might be preferable .",
    "if there is only one key exchanger per host in the fully connected network then the complexities for the fully connected network will be ; @xmath8 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , and will require a protocol which we will denote as @xmath16 to process a secure bit exchange with every host in the network .",
    "the fully connected network is robust and reliable as it does not depend on a single cable or key exchanger . if there is cable destruction or a damaged key exchanger then only the hosts connected by that cable or key exchanger will be affected , and only that connection will be affected .",
    "the affected hosts will still be able to process a secure bit exchange with other hosts which do not depend on the damaged cable or key exchanger .    to add additional hosts to the fully connected network",
    "will be trivial since it does not have a protocol . in the case of @xmath16",
    "the protocol will need to consider the added host .",
    "linear chain networks also know as bus networks or daisy chain networks , contain a single line and two key exchanges per host as illustrated in figure  [ fig : lch ] , and were analyzed in @xcite in the contexts of smart grids .",
    "the linear chain network with @xmath17 key exchangers per host has complexities of @xmath18 , @xmath14 , and @xmath19 .",
    "by having @xmath17 key exchanges per host the linear chain network can process @xmath17 simultaneous secure bit exchanges as long as one host is downstream , say host _ _",
    "i__@xmath20 for any positive integer @xmath21 and the other host is upstream , say host _ _",
    "i__@xmath22 for any positive integer @xmath23 of the _ _ i__th host . the first host and the last host are special cases which can not have simultaneous secure key exchanges with other hosts @xcite .",
    "the reliability of the linear chain network is dependent on the cable .",
    "if there is damage to the cable then the network will become two different networks divided at the location of the damaged cable , and the two networks can not process a secure bit exchange with each other .",
    "the linear chain network is more robust if there is damage to a key exchanger , then only the host with the damaged key exchanger will be slowed down but will be able connect with all other hosts in the network since there are two key exchangers per host .",
    "if an additional host joins the network with @xmath5 hosts then the protocol will consider @xmath24 hosts instead of @xmath5 , this will be a relatively simple fix as the the protocol can be preprogrammed in the hosts for any @xmath5 .",
    "the star network is a hub and spoke topology with a center switch like an old telephone exchange switch system , and has branches connected to the center .",
    "we denote the star network protocol with one key exchanger per host as @xmath25 .",
    "the complexities of the star network are @xmath18 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "figure  [ fig : starn ] is an example of a star network with @xmath5 branches .",
    "the most efficient protocol in the star network is similar to the protocol in the linear chain network in regards to first connecting to the nearest neighbors , then connecting the second nearest neighbors , and so on .",
    "the star network allows for faster speed than the linear chain network with similar cable and hardware complexities .      in graph theory the hosts",
    "are considered vertices and the cables are considered edges  @xcite . the protocol of the star network is to connect every host in the network to process a secure bit exchange with every other host in the network in the least number of secure bit exchange period ( sbep ) steps . in graph theory",
    "the star network protocol can be described as a special case of a edge - color problem  @xcite known as round - robin(rr ) tournament or all - play - all tournament problem  @xcite .",
    "the number @xmath26 of edge colors needed in graph theory is the number of sbeps needed in the star network protocol , although many geometric structures and edge - color problems have been studied in graph theory  @xcite and applied to various infrastructure networks  @xcite , it has not been applied to p2p hardware - based secure key exchange networks other than  @xcite .",
    "many network applications assume overlapping signals in the same channel is possible , and do not have a dedicated channel in which every vertex connects with every other vertex . for qkd and",
    "kljn network applications these networks require dedicated communication channels with no overlapping signals , and rr solutions to different geometric structures .",
    "the star network protocol presented in section 2.2 is specifically for qkd and kljn networks , and is significant since it combines residual sbep steps whenever possible , thus lowering the total number of sbeps needed , after a thorough literature review a similar rr solution was not found and the most similar solution found is in  @xcite .      for a network with @xmath5 hosts the star key exchange network protocol begins with every odd numbered host",
    "say _ _ i__th host with _",
    "i _ being odd and processes a secure bit exchange with their upstream nearest neighbor , that is host _ _",
    "i__+1 , this will take one secure bit exchange period ( sbep ) and the secure key exchange between different hosts will occur simultaneously .",
    "for example , host @xmath27 will process a secure bit exchange with host @xmath17 , while host @xmath28 will process a secure bit exchange with host @xmath29 , while host @xmath6 will process a secure bit exchange with host @xmath5 if @xmath5 is even , or host @xmath30 will process a secure bit exchange with host @xmath6 if @xmath5 is odd .",
    "if @xmath5 is odd , then the last host , that is host @xmath5 , will not process a secure bit exchange in the first sbep step .",
    "the next step in the protocol is for every even numbered host say _ _ i__th host with _",
    "i _ being even will process a secure bit exchange with their nearest upstream neighbor , say host _",
    "_ i__+1 , simultaneously .",
    "for example , host @xmath17 will process a secure bit exchange with host @xmath28 , while host @xmath29 will process a secure bit exchange with host @xmath31 , while host @xmath6 will process a secure bit exchange with host @xmath5 if @xmath5 is even , or host @xmath5 will process a secure bit exchange with host @xmath27 if @xmath5 is odd , note that the protocol will wrap around from the last host @xmath5 to the first host @xmath27 .",
    "the circular nature of the star network is a reason why it is faster than the linear chain network with similar cable and hardware complexities .",
    "the star network protocol @xmath25 then continues with every odd host to process a secure bit exchange with their upstream second nearest neighbor , that is every _ _ i__th host with _ i _ being odd with host _ _",
    "i__+2 , then the even numbered hosts will process a secure bit exchange with their second nearest neighbor , say every _ _ i__th host with _",
    "i _ being even with host _ _ i__+2 .",
    "the protocol continues by having every host process a secure bit exchange with their third nearest neighbors , then fourth nearest neighbors , and continues until every host in the network has processed a secure bit exchange with every other host .    as an example figure  [ fig : steps ] illustrates every step of the protocol star for a network with 5 hosts .",
    "the first sbep step in the protocol is illustrated in sub - figure  [ fig : step1 ] , note how every odd numbered host _",
    "i _ has a secure bit exchange with their next upstream nearest neighbor host _ _",
    "the second sbep step in the protocol is illustrated in sub - figure  [ fig : step2 ] , note how every even numbered host _",
    "i _ has a secure bit exchange with their next upstream nearest neighbor host _ _",
    "the third sbep step in the protocol is illustrated in sub - figure  [ fig : step3 ] .",
    "since the number of hosts in the network is odd it will take additional sbep steps to process a secure bit exchange with these remaining hosts , these are residual sbep steps .",
    "note how the last host wraps around to the first host .",
    "the fourth sbep step in the protocol is illustrated in sub - figure  [ fig : step4 ] . in this sbep step every odd numbered host _",
    "i _ has a secure bit exchange with their second upstream nearest neighbor host _ _",
    "the fifth sbep step in the protocol is illustrated in sub - figure  [ fig : step5 ] , this step is similar to step 4 except that now the even numbered hosts process a secure bit exchange with their second upstream nearest neighbors .",
    "the sixth and last sbep step in the protocol is illustrated in sub - figure  [ fig : step6 ] .",
    "since @xmath5 is odd the protocol requires additional residual sbep steps to process a secure bit exchange with the remaining hosts .",
    "note that for this example of the star protocol with @xmath32 hosts requires six sbep steps for every host in the network to process a secure bit exchange with every host .",

    "if a cable is damaged then it is best to have a @xmath11 network since only one connection between two hosts will be lost . in the linear chain network",

    "a damaged key exchanger will only affect one connection between two hosts . in the star network",
    "a damaged key exchanger will completely disconnect the affected host from the entire network .",
    "another weakness of the star network is the center switch , if the center switch is damaged then the entire network is disconnected .",
    "based on these three networks one can argue that the most robust reliable network is the @xmath11 followed by the linear chain network , and the least robust network of these three would be the star network .    to add hosts to the @xmath11 network would be trivial since the @xmath11 does need a protocol , all that is needed is to connect the host to every other host . to add hosts to the linear chain network and",
    "the star network will require every hosts in the network to change the protocol from @xmath5 hosts to @xmath24 hosts , this will be a relatively simple process as every host can be preprogrammed .",
    "the star network has complexity of @xmath39 for the number of cables , key exchangers , and time , but there are still numerous other geometric network topologies that have not been explored that might benefit kljn and qkd systems .",
    "other examples for possible networks include matrix networks , that is a grid of several vertical lines and horizontal lines",
    ". the matrix network might be a good model for an urban city with squared blocks .",
    "a wheel network is another possibility that might outperform the star network .",

    "a cube network is similar to the matrix network except that it is three dimensions .",
    "a sphere network might be another interesting three - dimensional network that can be compared with the cube network .",
    "since different geometrical topologies give different trade - offs , another interest is to explore the trade - offs of the different networks , and why it is preferable to sacrifice speed , communicators , or key exchangers for infrastructure and vice versa .",
    "another possible interest is to analyze and compare every geometric network with different number of communicators and how well they scale with speed .",
    "another possibility is to combine several of these networks into one network and analyze its performance , in graph theory this is known as hybrid networks .",
    "different geometic network structures have different vulnerabilites , an analysis of each network s vulnerabilites , robustness , reliability , and different kinds of attacks would be interesting to explore and compare .",
    "in this study we considered the need for unconditional secure key exchange along with the need to have p2p networks since qkd and kljn require p2p networks .",
