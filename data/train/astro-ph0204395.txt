    "the high - mass star - forming region w51 was discovered as a region of radio continuum emission by @xcite and as a massive molecular cloud by @xcite .",
    "it is one of the most luminous star - forming regions in our galaxy and may be the closest analog to the extremely luminous star forming regions found in many other galaxies ( e.g. 30 doradus in the lmc ) .",
    "w51 is far more luminous than the well - studied relatively nearby orion star forming region .",
    "the mass of the w51 complex has been estimated to be about 10@xmath3 @xmath4 @xcite , based both on virial mass estimates and @xmath5co intensities .",
    "mass estimates of molecular clouds in a complex environment obviously depend on where the boundaries are set , and this estimate refers to a set of emission features of approximately spherical shape .",
    "w51 is in the top 1% of all galactic molecular clouds by size , and the top 5 - 10% by mass .",
    "w51 lies in the plane of the galaxy at the substantial distance of 7.0 @xmath6 1.5 kpc measured by @xcite through proper motion studies of the w51 main h@xmath0o maser .",
    "w51 is therefore heavily obscured by interstellar extinction ( a@xmath7 = 24 @xmath6 3 mag , as measured by @xcite on the basis of the color of the extended emission ) .",
    "w51 is about 14 times farther away than orion and the distance modulus is almost 6 magnitudes larger than for orion , in addition to an extra 2 magnitudes of extinction in the k band , so that studies of w51 are necessarily limited to very bright objects and rather large extended features .",
    "numerous infrared sources were discovered in the radio continuum region w51 .",
    "one of these , w51 irs 2 @xcite , corresponding to the radio - continuum region w51e @xcite is now known to be a young embedded star cluster larger than the orion - trapezium cluster , as first suggested by @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of massive stars in w51 was done by @xcite .",
    "they identified 4 subgroups within w51 , roughly aligned parallel to the galactic plane , with average ages in those subgroups ranging from less than 1 myr to 2.3 myr .",
    "past studies of w51 have largely focussed on its global properties , e. g. , the total luminosity and mass , and have traced the effects of star formation integrated over the lifetime of o - stars , by studying radio continuum or br@xmath2 emission .",
    "this paper , by contrast , seeks to obtain a snapshot of star formation activity in the most recent past .",
    "stars in their main accretion phase still have a substantial fraction of their final ( zams ) mass residing in a circumstellar disk .",
    "they are therefore characterized by spectral energy distributions ( seds ) peaking at sub - mm wavelengths @xcite and are not directly detectable at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "fortunately , these class 0 sources usually also have strong outflows that can be traced by the shock - excited emission of h@xmath0 resulting from the interaction of the outflow with the ambient molecular cloud .",
    "examples of successful searches for outflows using narrow - band imaging in the h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) line are , among many others , @xcite , one of the earlier s(1 ) imaging surveys , and @xcite who conducted a survey of large areas in the orion gmc .",
    "very strong outflow activity and shock - excited molecular hydrogen emission persists only through the class 0 and early class i phases , i.e. for less than 10@xmath8y .",
    "in contrast to the study of hii regions , h@xmath0 outflows therefore trace contemporary lower mass star formation .",
    "we will discuss the technical aspects of the observations in chapter 2 .",
    "the results will be discussed in chapter 3 , separated into discussions of the overall distribution of outflow sources in chapter 3.1 and of the morphology of individual outflows in chapter 3.2 .",
    "velocity resolved spectroscopy of two outflows will be discussed in detail in chapters 3.3 and 3.4 , and some results on the embedded irs 2 cluster will be presented in chapter 3.5 .",
    "the data for this study of outflows in w51 were obtained in three observing runs .",
    "the initial wide - field imaging data in _ h _ , h@xmath0 1 - 0 s(1 ) at 2.122 @xmath1 m , and _",
    "k _ were obtained in 1997 and formed the basis for identifying previously unknown outflows .",
    "some of the brightest outflows discovered in this survey were subsequently imaged at higher spatial resolutions in s(1 ) and [ feii ] in june 2000 .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of two outflows was obtained at keck in may 2000 using nirspec @xcite .",
    "our search for emission line objects in w51 is based on a wide - field mosaic obtained in the broad band _",
    "h _ and _ k _ filters and in a narrow - band filter centered on the h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) line at 2.122 @xmath1 m .",
    "the data were obtained with the infrared camera quirc @xcite on 1997 august 16  19 ( ut ) at the uh 2.2 m telescope f/10 focus .",
    "the pixel scale was 0188 per pixel , resulting in a field of view of 193@xmath9193@xmath10 . to cover the large area of the w51 molecular cloud in a reasonable time",
    ", we used 10 s integration time in the _ h _ and _ k _ filters and 20 s in the molecular hydrogen s(1 ) narrow - band filter .",
    "the imaging data were obtained in a 10@xmath119 mosaicing pattern with 90@xmath10 spacing , so that every position on the sky is covered by at least 4 individual exposures .",
    "the total integration time for each point in the image is therefore 40 s in the broad - band filters and 80 s in the s(1 ) narrow - band filter .",
    "the individual frames were flatfielded using domeflats and known bad pixels were masked off .",
    "the individual reduced frames were assembled into the large mosaic by aligning stars in the overlap region between of two frames . the full _",
    "k_-band mosaic was assembled first , and then used as a template to position the individual frames obtained in the other filters .",
    "this method ensures that all three colors are well registered relative to each other , so that the three mosaic images can be combined into a false - color image .",
    "the three separate images in the three filters were then combined into a false - color image , with _",
    "h _ represented in blue , s(1 ) in green , and _ k _ in red . regions of s(1 ) line emission stand out as greenish features in this color scheme .",
    "a compressed version of this false - color image can be downloaded from http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/$\\sim$hodapp/w51-sm-rgb.jpg .",
    "visually identified potential shock front features were checked on the individual _",
    "s(1 ) , and _ k _ mosaics and false detections due to residual images , ghost images , or glare , as well as bad pixels or cosmic ray hits were discarded .",
    "the extended emission permeating much of the survey area has been shown by @xcite to be dominated by br@xmath2 and hei emission , but to also contain many emission lines of h@xmath0 , probably fluorescently excited by the uv field from the ionizing stars in the hii regions . in identifying shock - excited h@xmath0 emission in the survey images ,",
    "the distinction between shock - excited features and features excited by fluorescence in the stellar uv field can only be based on the strength of the h@xmath0 emission , i.e. its contrast relative to the broad - band images , and its morphology .",
    "objects identified as shock fronts in our survey have a strong contrast to the broad - band filters , indicating that their emission in the _ k _ band is dominated by h@xmath0 emission .",
    "they are either marginally resolved small knots or they clearly show the mophological features of bow shocks .",
    "in contrast , extended , rather diffuse features showing some h@xmath0 emission , but not being dominated by it , that are also mostly located on the perimeter of the hii regions outlined in broad - band _ k _ and the br@xmath2 image of @xcite , were not identified as potential stellar outflow shock fronts .",
    "these latter features are most likely excited by fluorescence in the uv radiation field generated by the ionizing stars in the hii regions , as first suggested by @xcite .",
    "the extent of the survey area and the location of detected s(1 ) emission features fitting our search criteria is indicated in fig .",
    "1 , the _ k_-band image produced in our survey . the individual emission knots , or systems of knots in cases of clearly related ( bipolar ) outflow features , are shown in fig .",
    "2 . for each object",
    ", the name follows the iau conventions and includes the j2000 coordinates .",
    "usually , the coordinates refer to the center of the extended emission region . in",
    "highly structured , irregular emission knots , the coordinates refer to the most prominent feature . for systems of emission features that morphologically",
    "appear to be part of one outflow , the coordinates refer to one of the features , and additional features are referred to by additional , self - explanatory designations ( n , s , w , e , or c ) .",
    "to obtain images at higher spatial resolution of some of the likely outflow shock fronts discovered in the wide - field survey , tip - tilt corrected images were obtained on june 16 - 19 , 2000 ( ut ) .",
    "the tip - tilt corrected f/31 focus @xcite of the uh 2.2 m telescope was used where the quirc infrared camera has a pixel scale of 0062 per pixel and a field of view of 63@xmath963@xmath10 .",
    "images were obtained in narrow - band [ feii ] 1.644@xmath1 m and h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) 2.122@xmath1 m filters and the data were reduced in the same way as described above for the wide - field images . under good seeing conditions ,",
    "the tip - tilt corrected images at 2.122@xmath1 m come close to the diffraction limit of the telescope and under more typical conditions , 0.3@xmath10 fwhm is achieved .",
    "high resolution echelle spectroscopy of two of the outflow sources in w51 was obtained in the night of may 28 , 2000 ( ut ) at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory , using the nirspec @xcite spectrograph .",
    "the weather in this night was non - photometric and unsuitable for flux calibration of the spectra .",
    "the spectra were obtained with two grating and filter settings : the first setting was for observations in the _ k _ band , intended to cover several of the h@xmath0 shock - excited emission lines but concentrating on the 1 - 0 s(1 ) line at @xmath12=2.1218334@xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "observations in br@xmath2 were not part of the original observing plan , since this line is rarely excited in h@xmath0 outflows .",
    "fortunately , the br@xmath2 line at @xmath13 m was also recorded in our _ k_-band spectra , albeit near the edge of the detector array so that wavelength calibration was difficult .",
    "the other grating setting was for observations in the _ h _ band , primarily to observe the [ feii ] line at @xmath12=1.64400@xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "since the objects are extended , sky spectra were taken separately at positions away from the visible shock fronts , but still within the extended emission from the hii regions permeating much of the w51 star forming region .",
    "the raw data frames were flatfielded with frames taken with continuum illumination of the spectrograph slit .",
    "we did not subtract dark current frames from the individual exposures , but relied on the sky frames to subtract dark current .",
    "wavelength calibration was done using oh airglow lines recorded during the on - object integrations .",
    "the line positions were measured on the flatfielded frames before sky subtraction . in the _ h _ band",
    ", we used the oh airglow lines ( wavelengths from the ukirt website ) at 1.63885@xmath1 m , 1.64147@xmath1 m , 1.64476@xmath1 m , and 1.65023@xmath1 m for wavelength calibration . in the _ k _ band , oh lines at 2.11766@xmath1 m , 2.12325@xmath1 m , and 2.12497@xmath1 m were used for wavelength calibration near the h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) line .",
    "as mentioned above , br@xmath2 was not part of the original observing plan , but was nevertheless recorded near the edge of the detector array .",
    "wavelength calibration for br@xmath2 is based on extrapolation from the two oh lines at 2.17111@xmath1 m and 2.18022@xmath1 m .",
    "unfortunately , we did not record any cataloged oh lines at wavelengths shorter than br@xmath2 in the same echelle order , limiting the accuracy of the wavelength calibration . only the [ feii ]",
    "line , h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) and br@xmath2 were evaluated .",
    "other transitions of h@xmath0 were detected in the spectrum , but not with sufficient signal to noise to allow detailed analysis .",
    "the slit width corresponds to a velocity resolution of 22 km / s .    in w51 ,",
    "@xcite have discussed near - infrared spectroscopy of the two compact hii regions w51 irs 2 east and west .",
    "they conclude that the faint s(1 ) line emission in or around the hii region is excited by fluorescence rather than shocks .",
    "this diffuse molecular hydrogen emission is distinct from the shock - excited emission discussed here for the outflow objects .",
    "however , the presence of uv - excited fluorescent s(1 ) line emission gives a background level of line emission that is clearly detected in our spectra and not always fully removed by the sky - subtraction process due to its spatial variation .",
    "the locations of the shock - excited h@xmath0 emission features are indicated on the _ k_-band image of the wide - field survey data ( fig .",
    "one group of outflows is located in dense filaments near the main hii regions associated with irs 1 and irs 2 .",
    "the others are distributed in almost a circular pattern at larger distances of about 6@xmath14 away from this central group , on the perimeter of the hii region complex .",
    "this distribution of outflow sources may be partly explained by an observational selection effect , since our detection method is clearly not as sensitive in regions superposed on or lying behind high levels of extended flux .",
    "more importantly , however , shock excited h@xmath0 emission can not occur in fully ionized regions . in the likely case that the distribution of outflows is not entirely dominated by selection effects , it suggests that the class 0 and class i sources responsible for these outflows may have formed as a result of secondary star formation triggered by winds from the central hii regions and the cluster around irs2 .",
    "the individual knots of h@xmath0 emission found in this survey are named following the iau convention : the name indicates their association with the w51 complex and their discovery by emission of the h@xmath0 molecule and gives their j2000 coordinates with 1@xmath10 precision . in the following , we will discuss the morphology of each candidate emission knot in detail .      the h@xmath0 emission w51h@xmath0",
    "j192318.1 + 142738 is a single , slightly elongated patch of s(1 ) emission , about 1.5@xmath10 in ns extent ( fig .",
    "2a ) .",
    "the emission knots w51h@xmath0 j192318.5 + 142656 and w51h@xmath0 j192319.6 + 142654 are only separated by about @xmath15 10@xmath10 .",
    "we show both of them in the high - resolution s(1 ) image fig . 3 and discuss their relationship below .",
    "many h@xmath0 outflows in nearby star - forming regions are associated with class 0 sources that are not directly visible at near - infrared wavelengths . since mass accretion and the associated outflow power peak during the class 0 phase",
    ", these extremely young sources often produce the strongest s(1 ) shock fronts",
    ". it would therefore be entirely plausible that the two shock fronts w51h@xmath0 j192318.5 + 142656 and w51h@xmath0 j192319.6 + 142654 are part of the same bipolar outflow , even though there is no positive detection of a central star that would drive the outflow .",
    "the arguments against this scenario are based on the morphology of other extended emission features in the immediate vicinity of these two brightest emission knots .",
    "the star @xmath15 9@xmath10 north of w51h@xmath0 j192318.5 + 142656 is the reddest object within about @xmath16 and shows some reflection nebulosity ( based the neutral color of the extended emission in the _ h _ , h@xmath0 s(1 ) and _ k _ image ) extending in the general direction of the w51h@xmath0 j192318.5 + 142656 emission knot .",
    "it is therefore a plausible alternative scenario that w51h@xmath0 j192318.5 + 142656 originates in an outflow from that red star ( probably a class i source ) .",
    "the emission knot w51h@xmath0 j192319.6 + 142654 shows extended emission north and bending towards east from the main emission knot .",
    "this emission is faintly indicated in fig .",
    "2a , showing that it is mainly s(1 ) emission , and is clearly shown in the high - resolution image in fig .",
    "3 . based on these two morphological arguments",
    ", we list the two emission knots as separate objects , probably belonging to different outflows .",
    "the s(1 ) line emission in w51h@xmath0 j192322.0 + 143333 appears marginally resolved in the high - resolution image in fig .",
    "the only other faint extended feature in this image is the elongated nebulosity 1@xmath10 east and 3.5@xmath10 south of w51h@xmath0 j192322.0 + 143333 that points roughly to the latter . on morphological grounds , it could be nebulosity associated with the driving source of w51h@xmath0 j192322.0 + 143333 , but is too faint to be detected in the _ h _ , h@xmath0 s(1 ) , and _",
    "k _ survey images , so its color is unknown .",
    "the pair of emission regions w51h@xmath0 j192323.6 + 142515 s and n are clearly part of the same bipolar outflow .",
    "the high - resolution s(1 ) image in fig .",
    "5 reveals a feature exactly in the middle of the bright n and s regions that consists of an unresolved source and some nebulosity , separated by about @xmath17 along the axis between w51h@xmath0 j192323.6 + 142515 s and n , at coordinates 19:23:23.6 + 14:25:15 ( j2000 ) .",
    "we label these features as w51h@xmath0 j192323.6 + 142515 c ( center ) .",
    "note that in this case the two shock fronts of this outflow are listed as the north and south features of an outflow listed under the coordinates of its central source .",
    "these central features are very red and are not visible at all in the _ h _ band wide - field image .",
    "they are weakly indicated in the _",
    "k_-band image .",
    "this is exactly the morphology seen in many closer bipolar outflow sources , where two shock fronts are seen equidistant to some scattered light near the central source .",
    "an example of this is the outflow in l 1634 ( hodapp & ladd , 1995 ) . for comparison , the extent of the w51h@xmath0 j192323.6 + 142515 outflow is @xmath18 between the two shock fronts , while the l 1634 outflow in orion at a distance of 500 pc is @xmath19 long , nearly the same linear projected extent of @xmath151 pc .",
    "two faint emission knots in close vicinity were found at the northern edge of our survey field .",
    "the two panels in fig .",
    "2b showing w51h@xmath0 j192325.9 + 143703 and w51h@xmath0 j192327.9 + 143701 actually overlap .",
    "there is no morphological indication that the two emission knots are part of the same outflow , so , conservatively , we list them separately , as was discussed above .",
    "the emission knot w51h@xmath0 j192335.0 + 143028 is a bright , compact knot of h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) line emission .",
    "close to it is a second emission knot w51h@xmath0 j192336.6 + 143014 .",
    "it is noteworthy that these two emission knots are collinear with one of the reddest stars detected in our whole w51 survey area , labeled rs in fig .",
    "6 , at 19:23:32.7 + 14:30:48 j2000 .",
    "the red star is undetected in our _ h_-band image , and appears much brighter in _ k _ ( 2.2@xmath1 m ) than in s(1 ) ( 2.12@xmath1 m ) , compared to other stars in the field .",
    "6 is a larger subframe of the survey images and illustrates this collinear relationship between these features .",
    "this alignment suggests that the red star may be the driving source of a well - collimated jet of @xmath15 2.2 pc projected length that produces the two emission knots .",
    "the degree of collimation of this jet would be quite remarkable , but not unprecedented .",
    "the faint emission knot w51h@xmath0 j192338.3 + 143047 has no morphological features ( fig .",
    "2c ) that would help in identifying its driving source .",
    "the largest shock - front detected in s(1 ) is w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 .",
    "it appears morphologically to be associated with a driving source in the general direction of the irs 2 young cluster to its south .",
    "a plausible candidate for the driving source is the extremely red star at 19:23:39.8 + 14:31:21 that lies close to the symmetry axis of the bow shock fronts .",
    "more detailed images in the emission lines of [ feii ] and s(1 ) are shown in fig .",
    "the s(1 ) emission shows the typical shape of multiple bow shocks , while [ feii ] is generally more concentrated on the axis of the outflow , i.e. the areas of highest shock velocity and excitation .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that the s(1 ) emission exhibits pronounced peaks near the apexes of two of the bow shocks , different from what is found in most other s(1 ) bow shocks , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this object will be discussed in more detail below ( 3.4 ) in the context of our spectroscopic data .",
    "the two emission knots found in w51h@xmath0 j192345.5 + 143537 are treated as part of one system , since their close proximity makes a chance superposition of two unrelated shock fronts very unlikely .",
    "the high - resolution image in fig .",
    "8 shows one knot clearly resolved , the other marginally resolved , but no further conclusions about the location of the driving source can be derived from these images .",
    "the star labeled as w51h@xmath0 j192347.2 + 142944 stands out due to its strong flux in the s(1 ) filter . while the star appears slightly more extended than other stars on the s(1 ) frame and more extended than its _",
    "k_-band image , the distribution of s(1 ) emission around the star can not be mapped out .",
    "we conclude that the molecular emission in this region originates in the immediate vicinity of the star .",
    "the emission knot w51h@xmath0 j192403.3 + 143255 is extended , but small . no obvious association with other emission knots or red stars",
    "was found that might help in identifying the driving source .      a high spatial resolution image of the two h@xmath0 emission features w51h@xmath0 j192323.6 + 142515",
    "n and s is shown in fig.5 and was discussed in section 3.2.4 .",
    "a high - resolution h@xmath0 spectrum was obtained towards only the southern component at the slit position indicated in fig.5 and is shown in fig.9 .    in knot",
    "_ s - a _ , farthest from the likely driving source , broad , double - peaked h@xmath0 profiles peaking at @xmath20 km s@xmath21 ( just blue of the cloud systemic velocity of 70 km s@xmath21 ) and @xmath22 km s@xmath21 ( blue - shifted by @xmath23 km s@xmath21 ) are observed .",
    "this velocity - split emission corresponds to two spatially separate emission knots in fig.5 .",
    "note however that the separation of the two velocity components is much larger than the spectral resolution of 22 km / s , so the velocity split is real and not just a projection of two spatially separate knots in the slit . behind ( north of ) the shock front _",
    "s - a _ ( offset 1  in fig.9 ) the h@xmath0 velocities converge to an intermediate , blueshifted velocity @xmath24 km s@xmath21 , spatially coinciding with a single emission knot centered on the slit .",
    "the fainter knot _ s - b _ ( not covered well by the slit ) also shows a double - peaked h@xmath0 profile with peaks at @xmath25 km s@xmath21 and @xmath26 km s@xmath21 , i.e. about 20 km s@xmath21 more blueshifted than knot s - c .",
    "further back towards the driving source , shock front _",
    "s - c _ is much more diffuse than _ s - a _ and _ s - b _ , and fainter .",
    "9 shows a broad line centered at @xmath27 km s@xmath21 , without a clear indication of a separation into two peaks .    the observed double - peaked h@xmath0 profiles , with peak - to - peak separations of @xmath28 km s@xmath21 ,",
    "are predicted by numerical models @xcite and are implied by the analytical @xcite j - type bow shock models of atomic line emission .",
    "the most extended , double - peaked profiles will be expected near the front of the bow shock ; narrow , low - velocity peaks will instead be associated with the oblique wings .",
    "indeed , the range of h@xmath0 velocities observed in w51h@xmath0 j192323.6 + 142515 s can be explained on purely geometrical grounds , if the flow is inclined towards the observer at an angle ( with respect to the line of sight ) of @xmath29 . by comparison ,",
    "a bow shock moving in the plane of the sky ( @xmath30 ) would produce two ( blended ) peaks blue- and red - shifted by the same amount , while a bow viewed head - on would produce only one , blue - shifted component ( see for example plots iv and i in the appendix in @xcite .",
    "overall , the spectral features seen in w51h@xmath0 j192323.6 + 142515 s are quite similar to those found in hh 111 by @xcite .",
    "they can be explained by the straightforward geometric fact that the h@xmath0 emission arises in the oblique shocks in the wings of the bow shocks , where shock velocities are low despite a high velocity of the jet relative to the ambient cloud medium .",
    "the shock velocities seen in w51h@xmath0 j192323.6 + 142515 s are just above the dissociation limit for pure j shocks , which suggests a certain degree of magnetic cushioning to avoid rapid dissociation of the h@xmath0 molecule @xcite .",
    "the bow shocks in w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 indicate a much faster and powerful outflow than the outflow discussed above .",
    "high - spatial resolution images of w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 in [ feii ] and h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) are shown in fig .",
    "this object is situated 23@xmath10 north of the irs 2 cluster .    in h@xmath0 ,",
    "w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 resembles a sequence of at least three `` nested '' bow shocks separated by 23 , labeled _ a _ , _ b _ and _ c _ in fig.7 .",
    "a very similar arrangement of nested bow shocks , with the larger ones being found in the wakes ( i.e. towards the driving source ) of smaller bow shocks , is observed in the low - mass l1634 outflow @xcite .",
    "the bow shock nature of w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 is confirmed by high - resolution spectroscopy in the h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) and [ feii ] lines ( fig .",
    "10 ) .    the [ feii ] emission in w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 ( fig . 7 , left panel ) appears to be generally more closely confined to the north - south outflow axis than the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "this is not unexpected since the [ feii ] traces the higher - excitation bow shock caps while the h@xmath0 is excited in the oblique , lower - excitation bow - shock wings @xcite .",
    "however , contrary to this generalized statement , we find strong h@xmath0 emission from near the apexes of the bow shocks , which we believe to result from fluorescence , as will be discussed below .",
    "we present [ feii ] , h@xmath0 , and br@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "10 ) spectra observed through the center of w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 .",
    "the slit was aligned to cover the brightest h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) emission knots ( _ b _ and _ c _ ) and is probably closely aligned with the outflow axis , if our identification of the driving source or at least the location of the driving source in the general area of irs 2 is indeed correct .",
    "millimeter - wave mapping of the cloud structure in w51a suggests that the lsr systemic velocity of the irs2 region is @xmath31 km s@xmath21 @xcite , although variations in the systemic velocities of cloud cores across the region are evident in the molecular cloud maps .",
    "spatially extended s(1 ) emission around irs 2 , probably uv - excited in the radiation field of the 0 stars in irs 2 , and largely subtracted out from our sky - subtracted spectral images , is centered around 70 km / s .",
    "all three spectra were individually wavelength calibrated using oh airglow lines recorded on the object frames .",
    "the wavelength calibration of the br@xmath2 line is relatively poor , since br@xmath2 was not part of the original observing plan and was only evaluated when interesting structure was unexpectedly found . as a consequence , br@xmath2 was recorded near the edge of the detector array where optical distortions could be significant , and the wavelength calibration could only be done by extrapolation from oh - lines , not by interpolation , since there were no oh lines recorded shortward of 2.166 @xmath1 m in the echelle order used .",
    "the small differences in the velocity of the narrow components of s(1 ) and br@xmath2 emission are probably due to these calibration problems and we do not believe they are significant .",
    "we adopt a systemic cloud velocity of @xmath23 km s@xmath21 for irs2 and w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 .    the position - velocity images in figs .",
    "10 show very distinct features in the three emission lines studied here .",
    "the h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) emission is largely confined to a narrow velocity range around the systemic velocity .",
    "the velocity structure seen in h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) is , however , correlated to the high - velocity features seen in [ feii ] and br@xmath2 , in the sense that knot _ b _ shows a slight blueshift and knot _ c _ a slight redshift . only in the faint knot _",
    "a _ , north of the main shock fronts , does the s(1 ) line split , producing a weak blueshifted component , as expected for the spectrum of a non - dissociative bow shock .",
    "the [ feii ] line is a more robust tracer of shocked gas than the rather fragile h@xmath0 molecule and more closely traces the full velocity field in the shock fronts , which in this case extends over a range of 300 kms@xmath21 .",
    "the detection of velocity features related to the shock fronts in br@xmath2 was a surprise .",
    "we had , of course , expected copious br@xmath2 emission from the nearby irs2 hii regions , either projected as foreground or background emission or scattered into the line of sight .",
    "however , the br@xmath2 line in w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 shows features clearly correlated to those seen in the other two lines studied here .",
    "these features are clearly related to the outflow shock fronts and make w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 a rare case of outflow shock fronts with detectable br@xmath2 emission .",
    "we will now discuss the individual emission lines in order of wavelength .",
    "the [ feii ] emission is concentrated in the region between the h@xmath0 knots _ b _ and _ c _ and is less spatially extended perpendicular to the jet axis than the s(1 ) emission ( fig .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that [ feii ] emission should be concentrated in the high excitation regions directly at the head of the bow shock , a region where s(1 ) emission is suppressed by dissociation of the h@xmath0 molecule .    at the position of knot",
    "_ c _ and up to 1.5north of it , the [ feii ] emission is strongly redshifted , and very broad , extending from @xmath24 km s@xmath21 to @xmath32 km s@xmath21 . further north , up to the position of knot _ b _ , broad emission is observed with velocities ranging from blueshifted @xmath33 km s@xmath21 to redshifted @xmath34 km s@xmath21 .",
    "overplotted on the spectral image in fig .",
    "10 is the normalized spectrum integrated over the relevant parts of the slit , for comparison with the model presented by @xcite .",
    "the broad , only slightly asymmetric profile measured in w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 closely matches the theoretical profile calculated for h@xmath35 emission of their 200 km / s jet model inclined by 60@xmath36 against the line of sight towards the observer ( their fig .",
    "3c ) . in our case ,",
    "the total velocity spread is larger , about 300 km / s and the redshifted component is somewhat stronger and more extended than the model would predict , but the overall agreement to the idealized model is remarkably good .",
    "the [ feii ] spectrum shows a much wider spread of velocities than the s(1 ) spectra at the same slit position .",
    "our s(1 ) and [ feii ] images suggest a spatial anticorrelation between the two emission lines .",
    "s(1 ) is primarily emitted in front and behind the main shock outlined in [ feii ] , since the high temperatures in this 300 km / s shock dissociate the h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "in addition to the good agreement of the integrated [ feii ] spectrum with the models by @xcite , the details of the [ feii ] spectrum , i.e. , the wide velocity range observed and the prominent redshifted emission can be explained by a fully developed hydrodynamical model .",
    "the hydrodynamical models of @xcite discuss the gas motions near the apex of a jet in detail .",
    "their fig .",
    "13 clearly shows that , in the reference frame of the jet , gas is being pushed sideways at the apex of the jet and streams backward in the wings of the bow shock .",
    "the same models also show that the velocity field in the bow of a shock can be complex and that knots of peculiar velocities exist . in the case of w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 where the predominantly blueshifted and redshifted components of [ feii ] emission are spatially separated",
    ", we have to postulate that the emission arises from distinct emission knots near the apex of the bow , the redshifted emission being on the far side of the jet and therefore receding relative to the jet , while the blueshifted emission is from the near side of the bow , moving towards the observer in excess of the jet velocity .",
    "the h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) line in w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 is strikingly narrow in an object that shows such substantial line width in [ feii ] . only the northernmost and faintest of the emission knots identified in fig .",
    "7 ( knot _ a _ ) shows the split line profile expected from a bow shock seen from the side .",
    "the presence of [ feii ] emission supports j - type shock excitation , i.e. , no significant cushioning by magnetic fields . in such shocks",
    ", h@xmath0 will be dissociated at relatively low shock velocities , of the order of 20 - 25 kms@xmath21 .",
    "the centers of the two velocity components in knot _ a _ are separated by about 50 kms@xmath21 , which is roughly double the dissociation shock velocity limit for h@xmath0 .",
    "the other two knots ( _ b _ and _",
    "c _ ) do not show a splitting of the lines , but show slightly broadened spectral features spreading over a maximum of 50 kms@xmath21 , i.e. within the dissociation limit . the velocity structure is related to the velocity field seen in [ feii ] emission in the sense that knot _ b _ exhibits a slight blueshift while knot _ c _ is slightly redshifted . h@xmath0 will survive and be collisionally excited into emission only in the oblique wings of the bow shocks , exhibiting narrow line profiles .",
    "an example of this are the bullets in orion @xcite where the tips of the bows are traced in [ feii ] and the wings in h@xmath0 s(1 ) .",
    "however , in our images the h@xmath0 emission appears brightest on - axis , in the two compact knots _ b _ and _ c _ near the apex of the bow shocks , where molecules will be collisionally dissociated .",
    "we therefore postulate that the strong , spatially concentrated h@xmath0 emission near the apex of the bow with narrow line width represents fluorescent emission from quiescent molecular material in front of the bow shock that is excited by the uv radiation field generated by the high temperature in the shock front .",
    "the presence of br@xmath2 emission in the shock front is proof that temperatures high enough to dissociate h@xmath0 and ionize h exist locally in the shock front .",
    "fluorescent emission from h@xmath0 in the uv has been found in iue spectra of several hh objects by @xcite . in an object similar to w51h@xmath0 j192339.7",
    "+ 143131 , the well studied hh 7 , the higher excitation lines of h@xmath0 have been explained by fluorescence of h@xmath0 in the presence of a strong uv field generated in the shock fronts @xcite .",
    "emission in the br@xmath2 line is very rarely seen in the shock fronts of stellar outflows , even though h@xmath35 is commonly observed in low - extinction herbig - haro jets and shock fronts ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "br@xmath35 has recently been observed @xcite in an outflow from a high - mass star .",
    "emission of br@xmath2 is , of course , expected near the hii region associated with irs2 and could arise in the foreground or background of the outflow shock fronts of w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 , or be scattered into that line of sight .",
    "remarkably , however , the br@xmath2 emission in w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 shows features similar to those seen in [ feii ] and h@xmath0 , demonstrating that a significant fraction of the br@xmath2 flux originates in the outflow shock fronts themselves .",
    "the brightest peak in the br@xmath2 position - velocity image is just north of knot _",
    "b_. the narrow - line br@xmath2 intensity south of knot _ b _ drops to 55% of its value ( per pixel ) just north of this knot .",
    "this indicates that @xmath1545% of this narrow - line flux must originate close to the shock front , while @xmath1555% may be foreground or background flux from elsewhere along the line of sight . the br@xmath2 emission in knot _ c",
    "_ is more spatially extended than the h@xmath0 emission , but they are clearly related .    at very low but clearly significant flux levels , spectrally very broad br@xmath2 emission essentially duplicates the features seen in [ feii ] : strong blueshift in knot _ b _ and redshift in knot _ c _ , with about the same total velocity extent .",
    "this component of the br@xmath2 emission is clearly related to fast moving gas in the bow shock front .",
    "the broad high - velocity br@xmath2 emission is probably collisionally excited in the rapid , high - excitation shock fronts , similar to the [ feii ] emission .    as explained above , absolute velocity calibration of the br@xmath2",
    "is rather uncertain due observational limitations .",
    "we therefore do not ascribe any significance to the absolute velocity difference between the h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) and br@xmath2 lines in fig .",
    "10 .      of the three emission lines discussed here ,",
    "[ feii ] is a pure and robust tracer of shock - excited gas .",
    "it shows a spread of velocities over a range of 300 kms@xmath21 and its integrated line profile matches simple models of bow shock emission very well .",
    "the br@xmath2 line traces both the high - velocity gas , either by direct shock excitation or uv excitation from the shock , but also traces the low velocity components , by uv excitation from the shock in addition to fore and background emission .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission traces only low - velocity gas , since h@xmath0 dissociates in high velocity shocks .",
    "the strong h@xmath0 emission from the tips of the bow shocks can best be explained by fluorescent excitation of h@xmath0 molecules in the radiation field of the shock , just prior to their being dissociated when hit by the shock directly .",
    "an outflow system appearing superficially similar to w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 are the `` bullets '' observed to emerge from a source in the orion - trapezium cluster . a detailed study of this system , including high - resolution spectroscopy in the [ feii ] and h@xmath0 s(1 ) lines has recently been presented by @xcite .",
    "the shock fronts in w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 appear to have a more organized large scale shape than the system of small  bullets  in orion , but some small - scale clumpy structure is clearly present in w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 .",
    "the orion  bullets  do not show the very broad [ feii ] profiles seen in w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 143131 and they do not exhibit the strong h@xmath0 emission at the apex of the bow shock .",
    "rather , they show h@xmath0 only in the wings of the bow shocks , as expected from pure shock excitation .    observations in [ feii ] of the jets emanating from l1551 irs5 have recently been reported by @xcite .",
    "their spectra along the jet axis show a similarly broad velocity profile of the [ feii ] line to the one reported here .",
    "in contrast to our observations , theirs concentrated on the jet close to its source of origin and did not include well developed bow shocks .",
    "the narrow - band h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) line image was also used to study the young cluster surrounding in more detail .",
    "this image reaches about the same limiting magnitude and has better spatial resolution than the _",
    "k_-band image obtained of the wider w51 region , and is therefore best suited for a rough count of the stars contained in this cluster .",
    "the s(1 ) line image was photometrically calibrated using the standard star fs 27 @xcite so that approximate _ k_-band magnitudes could be obtained . down to a limiting magnitude of _",
    "k_=15.3 , we count 60 stars within a projected circle of 1 pc diameter . @xcite have already pointed out that one foreground star is visible in front of the w51 irs 2 cluster , but clearly most of the stars counted around irs 2 are physically close to this embedded source . the image ( fig .",
    "11 ) also shows areas very near irs 2 that appear as dark patches against the extended flux of the hii region and with virtually no stars , indicating opaque extinction .",
    "roughly half of the 1 pc diameter circle is covered by such extinction .",
    "the distance of 7kpc to w51 , compared to 0.5 kpc to the trapezium cluster , makes stars appear 5.73 magnitudes fainter .",
    "@xcite found a strong peak at a@xmath7=25 mag in their extinction histogram of `` region 3 '' that contains the young embedded cluster associated with irs2 .",
    "we take a@xmath7=25 here as an estimate of the extinction to those stars in the cluster that are not completely obscured , obviously an extreme simplification of the actual situation .",
    "similar a@xmath7 values were found for many of the stars in the immediate vicinity of irs2 by @xcite .",
    "while infrared excess may be partly responsible for the red colors leading to these extinction estimates , we assume here that stars in the w51 irs2 cluster suffer about a@xmath37=2 mag more extinction than the low - extinction stars seen in the orion trapezium @xcite .",
    "this statement obviously excludes the high extinction objects in the bn / kl region . combining the effects of distance modulus and extinction",
    ", stars in the w51 irs2 cluster appear about 7.7 mag fainter than they would in the orion trapezium cluster . our limiting _",
    "k_-band magnitude of 15.3 in the high - resolution image in fig .",

    "k_=7.6 mag in a circle of projected diameter of 1 pc , using photometry in the trapezium cluster from @xcite .    in comparing the young stellar clusters associated with the orion trapezium and w51 irs 2",
    ", we can reach a few tentative conclusions , despite the uncertainties in the estimates for extinction and the incompleteness of the star count due to opaque areas obscuring about half the cluster , if one assumes a roughly spherical intrinsic distribution of the stars .",
    "the star count in the w51 irs2 cluster appears between 4 to 8 times higher than in the trapezium cluster .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the count of o stars by @xcite ( 4 in trapezium vs. probably 9 in w 51 irs 2 ) .",
    "our _ h _ , h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) , and _",
    "k_-band survey of the w51 gmc resulted in the discovery of 14 h@xmath0 shock fronts associated with stellar outflows .",
    "the outflows are found in dense molecular filaments near the central hii regions and the young embedded cluster associated with irs 2 , and near the perimeter of the molecular cloud complex , away from the hii regions .",
    "we speculate that the outflows near the perimeter represent a secondary , triggered phase of star formation in w51 .      for two of the outflow shock fronts ,",
    "high resolution spectroscopy was obtained .",
    "of particular interest are the shock fronts w51h@xmath0 j192339.7 + 14313",
    ". the very broad [ feii ] line seen in this shock front is in good agreement with models developed by @xcite for other atomic lines in shock fronts .",
    "refinements of these models based on the hydrodynamic models of @xcite lead to a satisfactory agreement with the observations , even though the large observed line width and the large redshifted component remain quite remarkable .",
    "we also report the very rare detection of high - velocity br@xmath2 emission from this outflow , with a high - velocity components essentially matching the [ feii ] profiles .",
    "the strong , narrow h@xmath0 10 s(1 ) emission found near the apex of the shock fronts strongly suggests fluorescence as the excitation mechanism for h@xmath0 at this location . the outflow w51h@xmath0",
    "j192339.7 + 14313 is driven by a source associated with the irs 2 young embedded cluster .",
    "based on star counts and rough extinction estimates , we conclude that this cluster is more massive , richer in stars and richer in high - mass stars than the orion - trapezium cluster , in agreement with previous results by others .",
    "the imaging data presented here were obtained at the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope .",
