    "reliable astrophysical and structural parameters of galactic open clusters ( ocs ) are an excellent source of information for interpreting their dynamics , and the 2mass jh@xmath2 photometric data base provides a unique opportunity to derive these kind of parameters in a uniform way",
    ".    the stellar content of ocs undergoes internal and external changes related to , e.g. stellar evolution , mass segregation , and encounters with the disk and giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "combined , these process produce a varying degree of mass loss that may lead to the cluster dissolution into the field .",
    "for instance , the relative lack of old ocs in the solar vicinity can be partly explained by encounters with gmcs . the mass function slope @xmath7 , relaxation time and evolutionary parameters are required @xcite in order to be able to see mass segregation effects in the stellar content of ocs .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the above issues on three poorly studied ocs based on the improved field star decontamination procedure via 2mass jh@xmath2 photometry @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  2 the 2mass photometry and the field star decontamination algorithm ( employed in the cmd analyses )",
    "are presented .",
    "the derivation of astrophysical and structural parameters , and a comparison with the literature , are given in sections  3 to 5 .",
    "section  6 is dedicated to mass function properties of the clusters .",
    "discussion of the results are in section  7 . finally , in section  8 a conclusion is given .",
    "the jh@xmath2 photometry of 2mass catalogue @xcite has been used to find the cluster members of the ocs , , and . for this",
    ", vizier was used to extract j , h , and @xmath2 2mass photometry for a large - area centred on these clusters .",
    "the xdss r images of , , are displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "the technique used here for determining the cluster members of the three clusters is the field star decontamination procedure coupled to the 2mass jh@xmath2 photometry .",
    "it samples photometric properties of the stars in a comparison field to ( statistically ) remove the field contamination from the cluster cmd .",
    "this technique has been succesfully used by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and applied to , , and .",
    "first , the stellar surface density @xmath8 ) of the raw data of these three clusters , computed for a mesh size of @xmath9 and centred on the coordinates in table 1 , has been displayed in the top panels of figs .",
    "the isopleth surfaces of these clusters are presented in the bottom panels of figs .",
    "2@xmath104 . from the stellar radial density profile ( hereafter rdp ) of each cluster , built based on the jh@xmath2 photometry extracted for the webda coordinates in table 1 , the cluster radii are taken to be @xmath11 ( ) , @xmath12 ( ) and @xmath13 ( ) , respectively ( see col .  10 of table  4 ) .",
    "the stellar rdp is the projected number of stars per area around the cluster centre . to avoid oversampling near the centre and undersampling for large radii",
    ", the rdps are built by counting stars in concentric rings of increasing width with distance to the centre .",
    "the number and width of rings are optimised so that the resulting rdps have adequate spatial resolution with moderate @xmath14 poisson errors .",
    "the residual background level of each rdp corresponds to the average number of cm - filtered stars measured in the comparison field .",
    "consequently , stars within these cluster radii are considered to be probable cluster members .",
    "as the stellar comparison field , a wide external ring @xmath15 has been considered to eliminate field stars .",
    "as @xcite noted , rdps of ocs built based on the webda coordinates usually show a dip in the inner rdp region .",
    "for this reason , new central coordinates of these clusters have been searched to maximise the star counts at the innermost rdp bin .",
    "then , the 2mass photometry was extracted again , but now centered on the optimised cluster coordinates .",
    "the optimised central coordinates are displayed in the panels of fig .  1 as small circles , and given in the right section of table 1 .",
    "to have the intrinsic cmd morphology of the clusters , the statistical field star decontamination procedure of @xcite is used .",
    "this procedure is based on the relative number densities of stars in a cluster region and offset field .",
    "it divides the full range of magnitudes and colours of a cmd into the cell dimensions of @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "these dimensions are adequate to allow sufficient star counts in individual cells and preserve the intrinsic morphology of the evolutionary sequences .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the field star decontamination procedure with 2mass jh@xmath2 is efficient in isolating stars with a high probability of being cluster members .",
