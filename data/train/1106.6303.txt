    "in @xcite we presented a non - conformal holographic bottom - up model that captures some of the phenomenological properties of qcd at finite temperature . in this model , asymptotic freedom is replaced by conformal invariance above a certain uv scale .",
    "the main idea is to break the conformal invariance of @xmath1 sym field theory from the original ads / cft correspondence @xcite in order to study effects from the qcd trace anomaly and its thermodynamical consequences as closely as possible . our model is based on a bottom - up approach to this problem ( for an alternative , top - down approach , see e.g. @xcite ) where we consider an effective , 5-dimensional gravity theory coupled to a scalar field @xcite .",
    "the potential for the scalar field @xmath2 breaks conformal invariance in the infrared and it is engineered to holographically reproduce some thermodynamical properties of finite - temperature qcd @xcite that have been computed on the lattice @xcite .",
    "the space - time geometry is asymptotically @xmath3 , which is translated into conformal invariance of the dual field theory in the uv .",
    "a heavy quark of mass @xmath4 is dual to a string in the bulk which stretches from the bottom of a d4-brane located at a radial coordinate @xmath5 ( in coordinates where the boundary is at @xmath6 ) to the black brane horizon at @xmath7 @xcite . using the trailing string ansatz",
    ", we can study the heavy quark energy loss @xcite in our model at various temperatures and momenta , and significant deviations from the results in the conformal limit have been observed around @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "here we use this setup to compute the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 of charm and bottom quarks ( for similar calculations in a conformal plasma see @xcite ) .",
    "we use glauber initial conditions where the number density of binary collisions @xmath9 and the participant nucleon density @xmath10 are obtained from a woods - saxon nuclear distribution .",
    "a jet produced at a point @xmath11 in the transverse plane and moving in the azimuthal direction @xmath12 `` sees '' at time @xmath13 the temperature @xmath14^{1/3}$ ] , where @xmath15 is the initial jet production time , which we chose to be 1 fm / c . to compute @xmath0 as a function of @xmath16 , the final momentum of the quenched jet",
    ", one must know its corresponding initial momentum @xmath17 . to obtain that",
    ", one must , for a given @xmath11 and @xmath12 , solve the differential equation @xmath18(p(t),t(\\vec{x}_\\perp,\\phi , t))$ ] , where @xmath19(p , t)$ ] is the energy loss as a ( numerical ) function of momentum and temperature obtained from our model .",
    "this equation is solved with the condition @xmath20 , where the final time @xmath21 is defined by a standard freeze - out condition , @xmath22 , where we chose @xmath23 mev .",
    "the initial momentum is then obtained as @xmath24 .",
    "finally , one must average over the azimuthal directions @xmath12 and the transverse production points @xmath11 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total number of binary collisions and @xmath27 are distribution functions obtained from the fonll production cross sections @xcite .",
    "we computed @xmath0 for heavy quarks at rhic and lhc energies with the initial temperatures at the center of the plasma of 265 mev and 357 mev and nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross - sections @xmath28 4.2 and 6.3 @xmath29 @xcite , respectively ( fig .  1 , left plot ) . for bottom quarks",
    ", @xmath0 flattens out already at @xmath30 gev , which is a consequence of the asymptotic conformal invariance of our model . also , note that the values of @xmath0 for rhic and lhc are very similar .",
    "in fact , even though the maximum temperature at lhc is higher than at rhic , the spectral indices at rhic are steeper than at lhc and , thus , the heavy quark @xmath0 does not change much when one increases @xmath31 by one order of magnitude .    for charm quarks",
    "@xmath0 is relatively small , which is simply due to the fact that the trailing string energy loss in _ any _ holographic model decreases monotonically with mass .",
    "however , one should be careful when using the trailing string ansatz in this case since already for @xmath32 290 mev , @xmath33 for the charm quark , which implies that the trailing string ansatz is not applicable in this case .",
    "for light quarks , the bottom of the d4-brane @xmath34 can approach the black brane event horizon @xmath7 . in this case",
    "we follow @xcite and study open strings with both endpoints on the flavor brane , which fall freely towards the black brane .",
    "these strings are dual to dressed @xmath35 pairs and the total spatial distance the string endpoint traverses can be identified with the stopping distance of light quarks in a strongly - coupled plasma .    for a given initial energy of the string ,",
    "this stopping distance will vary with the string initial conditions ( initial spatial and velocity profile ) .",
    "however , it is still possible to obtain the maximum stopping distance for a given energy .",
    "in fact , it was shown in @xcite that this quantity scales as @xmath36 in a conformal plasma . however , in our model , this power gets modified and the effective power becomes temperature and energy - dependent , @xmath37 ( fig .  1 , center and right plots ) .",
    "we see that for large enough energies this effective power asymptotes to the conformal value of @xmath38 and also that the effective power is closer to the @xmath38 limit the further away we are from @xmath8 , which are both consequences of the asymptotic conformal invariance of our model .",
    "note , however , that this maximum stopping distance is not a _ typical _ stopping distance of light quarks ; it is a rather crude quantity , which might be used as a phenomenological guideline , but should not be used to obtain the instantaneous energy loss that enters in , for example , calculations of @xmath0 .",
    "instantaneous energy loss , defined as the usual @xmath39 worldsheet current , becomes a non - trivial quantity in this case since it is explicitly time - dependent and also depends on the point on the string on which one evaluates it . as shown in @xcite , at late times the instantaneous energy loss develops a bragg - like peak but its magnitude depends on the point on the string where the energy loss is evaluated .",
    "furthermore , the amount of instantaneous energy loss depends heavily on the initial conditions of the string ( which are dual to the initial gauge field configuration associated with the @xmath35 pair ) .",
    "these two problems are the main obstacles that need to be overcome in order to obtain a consistent description of light quark energy loss that can be used in the calculation of observables such as @xmath0 .",
    "in this proceedings we have extended our previous analysis of heavy quark energy loss in non - conformal plasmas started in @xcite and computed the partonic @xmath0 in an expanding plasma with glauber initial conditions .",
    "the bottom quark @xmath0 at rhic decreases with @xmath40 and asymptotes to a value of about 0.2 .",
    "charm @xmath0 is predicted to be heavily suppressed ( @xmath41 ) , but one should keep in mind that the trailing string model may not be applicable to describe charm quarks . according to our calculations , the heavy quark @xmath42 remains practically unaltered when going from rhic to lhc energies .",
    "we also showed that the typical effective power in the energy dependence of the maximum stopping distance of light quarks becomes energy and temperature dependent in a non - conformal plasma .",
    "a consistent treatment of instantaneous energy loss of light quarks has some practical difficulties and possible solutions are currently being explored @xcite .",
