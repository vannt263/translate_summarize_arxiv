    "more precisely , one can prove that @xmath372 for all @xmath369 .",
    "indeed , we readily compute that @xmath373 fulfills @xmath374 moreover , we easily check that @xmath375 in a right neighborhood of @xmath376 ( arguing for instance as in the proof of lemma [ zero ] ) .",
    "assume by contradiction that there exists @xmath377 such that @xmath378 and @xmath379 on @xmath380 .",
    "then , relation entails that @xmath381 on the other hand , since @xmath382 never vanishes and is the only solution to for @xmath383 , by arguing along the same lines of lemma [ polp ] one readily has that @xmath384 where @xmath385 is the absolutely continuous measure @xmath386 .",
    "this contradicts and the assertion follows .",
    "as already mentioned , the analysis of the radial self - similar solvability of has been addressed in @xcite for @xmath387 . in particular , kamin , peletier , & vazquez focus on self - similar solutions of the form @xmath388 and develop a full analysis on their relevance in determining the long - term behavior of solutions to with exponentially decaying , continuous , and non - negative initial data .    among these results , they prove in particular that there exists a unique @xmath389 such that the corresponding self - similar solution @xmath16 is positive and @xmath390 as @xmath391 ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.1 - 2.2 ) .",
    "moreover , they directly check that @xmath392 and it is such that @xmath393 changes sign exactly once being negative inside some given ball and positive outside ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.12 ) .",
    "our analysis is independent from the former since , clearly , the time derivative of a self - similar solution is not self - similar in general . on the other hand , the above - mentioned results are strongly reminiscent of our situation where we obtain that , letting @xmath13 be a negatively - homogeneous radial solution to for @xmath339 , the function @xmath394 changes sign exactly once in correspondence to some specific homogeneity range .",
    "moreover , within the latter range we can select a specific value @xmath395 such that @xmath396 behaves nicely as @xmath397 .",
    "hence , at least at this formal level , our value @xmath398 plays essentially the role of @xmath399 in the analysis of @xcite .",
