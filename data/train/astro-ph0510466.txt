    "models of neutron star ( ns ) cooling ( e.g. , yakovlev & pethick 2004 ) predict that at an age of @xmath12 myr at least passively cooling nss become too cold to emit x - rays from the bulk of ns surface .",
    "therefore , x - ray emission from isolated radio pulsars of such old ages is expected to consist of a magnetospheric component and , possibly , a thermal component emitted from small areas ( polar caps [ pcs ] ) heated by relativistic particles created in the pulsar s acceleration zones ( e.g. , harding & muslimov 2001 , 2002 ; hereafter hm01 and hm02 ) .",
    "hence , studying the x - ray emission from old pulsars allows one to examine the properties and evolution of magnetospheric radiation , probe the particle acceleration mechanisms operating in the magnetospheres , and constrain the pc heating and emission models .",
    "although most of the @xmath13 currently known radio pulsars are older than 1 myr ( see fig .  1 ) , they are intrinsically faint x - ray sources because the luminosities of both the magnetospheric and pc components are fractions of the spin - down power @xmath8 , which decreases with pulsar s age .",
    "so far , only seven pulsars with characteristic ages @xmath14 have been detected in x - rays ( i.e. , about 10% of x - ray detected `` ordinary '' pulsars ) , all of them at distances @xmath152 kpc ( zavlin & pavlov 2004 [ hereafter zp04 ] ; becker et al .",

    ", the magnetospheric and pc components of x - ray radiation can be distinguished by their spectra and pulse shapes ( e.g. , the magnetospheric radiation is expected to have a harder spectrum and show sharper pulsations ) . however , even the brightest of the detected old pulsars are too faint to establish the spectral shape unambiguously . for instance , the spectrum of the relatively bright psr b0950 + 08 ( @xmath16 pc , @xmath17 myr , @xmath18 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath3 ) , observed recently with , can be fitted with either a single power - law ( pl ) model with photon index @xmath19 or a combination of a pl model ( @xmath20 ) and a thermal ( hydrogen atmosphere ) model , with pc temperature @xmath21 mk and radius @xmath22 m ( the two - component interpretation is supported by the energy - dependent pulse shape ; zp04 ) . therefore , it is important to observe a larger sample of old pulsars and study their properties via comparative analysis .    in this",

    "interestingly , pl fits of some other old pulsars ( e.g. , b0943 + 10 , b0628@xmath3128 ) also show very soft spectra , with @xmath723 ( zp04 ; zhang et al .",
    "2005 ; gelman , & tepedelenliolu 2005 ) , suggesting that pulsar spectra might soften with increasing age or decreasing spin - down power .",
    "however , the example of psr b0950 + 08 , the oldest in the sample , demonstrates that the softness of the one - component pl fit may be caused by the presence of a thermal ( pc ) component , which mostly contributes at lower energies : a single pl fit gives @xmath73 for psr b0950 + 08 , while the slope of the pl component in the two - component fit is @xmath741.3 , similar to younger pulsars ( zp04 ) .",
    "the extrapolation of the x - ray pl fit into the optical range predicts easily detectable optical magnitudes ( e.g. , @xmath7524 mag ) .",
    "a more realistic prediction , @xmath7630 mag , can be obtained from the empirical relation between the optical and x - ray fluxes of spin - powered pulsars ( zp04 ) .",
    "the luminosity found from the pl fit allows one to estimate the `` x - ray efficiency '' for b1133 : @xmath77 in the 0.58 kev band ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the 110 and 210 kev bands , respectively ) .",
    "the inferred efficiency is larger than for most young and middle - aged pulsars ( e.g. , possenti et al.2002 ) , but it is within the range of efficiencies found for other old pulsars ( zp04 ) .",
    "we plot in figure 5 the 110 kev luminosities of eight old pulsars , as inferred from the pl fits , versus spin - down power and characteristic age myr , is larger than its actual age . notice that its position on the @xmath32-@xmath41 diagram is also quite different from those of the other pulsars in the sample ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "] . for the pulsars",
    "whose parallaxes have not been measured , we ascribe a factor of 2 uncertainty to the distances estimated from the pulsar s dispersion measure .",
    "although the luminosity shows some correlation with @xmath8 , the scatter is quite substantial ( for instance , the luminosities of b0628@xmath3128 and b0823 + 26 differ by about 2 orders of magnitude despite the close values of @xmath8 ) . such a scatter can possibly be attributed to different orientations of the pulsar beams with respect to the observer .",
    "overall , the apparent x - ray efficiencies of the observed old pulsars are somewhat higher than those of younger pulsars , but this can be caused by the selection effect ( the sample is biased in favor of brighter objects ) .",
    "the correlation of the luminosity with the characteristic age is even less pronounced ; for instance , the luminosity of the oldest psr b0950 + 08 ( @xmath17 myr ) is a factor of 10 higher than those of psrs b1133 + 16 , b0943 + 10 , and b0823 + 26 ( @xmath80 myr ) .",
    "we should remember , however , that the characteristic age can be substantially different from the true age , so the dependence @xmath81 may not accurately characterize the pulsar evolution .    the best - fit temperature , @xmath9 mk , obtained from the bb fit to the spectrum of b1133 , is close to @xmath82 mk and @xmath83 mk obtained from the bb fit for psr b0943 + 10 and bb+pl fit for psr b0950 + 08 , respectively .",
    "although the effective radius of the emitting region , @xmath84 m , is highly uncertain because of poor statistics , it is certainly smaller than the conventional pc radius assuming a dipole magnetic field , @xmath85 m. a similar discrepancy is also seen in the above - mentioned fits to the spectra of b0943 + 10 ( @xmath86 m , @xmath87 m ) and b0950 + 08 ( @xmath88 m , @xmath89 m ) .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest that the small x - ray emitting area can be explained assuming that only a small fraction of the pc area is heated by the inflowing relativistic particles created in `` spark discharges '' above the pc ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 )",
    ". an independent support of this interpretation is provided by the subpulse drifting observed in b0943 + 10 .",
    "no subpulse drifting has been reported for b1133 + 16 , but this may be the result of a different orientation of the pulsar beam .",
    "the discrepancy can also be caused by a pc thermal spectrum being different from the blackbody .",
    "for instance , fits with the magnetic hydrogen atmosphere ( nsa ) models ( pavlov et al .",
    "1995 ) usually give a factor of 2 lower temperatures and a factor of 510 larger radii , with about the same observed luminosity .",
    "zp04 explored this possibility for psr b0950 + 08 and obtained a temperature of @xmath741.1 mk and an emitting radius of 250 m , close to the @xmath90 m. we do not attempt to fit the spectrum of b1133 with the nsa models because too few counts were detected and , with the time resolution of 3.2 s , we can not extract the light curves of the 1.19 s pulsations needed for an accurate analysis of the highly anisotropic atmosphere radiation .    as one",
    "can see from table 2 and figure 3 , the quality of the bb fit is worse than that of the pl fit because of an excess of observed counts at @xmath91 kev .",
    "this indicates that the spectrum might have both thermal and nonthermal ( pl ) components , similar to those seen in many younger pulsars and , likely , in the old b0950 + 08 ( pavlov et al .",
    "2002 ; zp04 ) .",
    "it is very likely that the radiation of the other old pulsars , from which too few counts have been detected to firmly establish the origin of their x - ray emission , also consists of both thermal and nonthermal components .",
    "if this is the case , the luminosities inferred from the bb fits should be considered as upper limits .",
    "the current upper limits on bolometric bb luminosities are close to the 110 kev pl luminosities shown in figure 5 .",
    "if the x - ray radiation from b1133 is dominated by the thermal emission from pcs , then its pc efficiency is @xmath92 ( @xmath93 for @xmath94 ) .",
    "this efficiency is two orders of magnitude lower than those predicted by hm01 models for the curvature radiation ( cr ) induced pair cascade ( fig .  7 of hm01 ) , which might indicate that the cr cascade does not operate in b1133 .",
    "indeed , this pulsar is very close to the `` cr death line '' in the @xmath32-@xmath41 diagram ( see fig .  1 ) , perhaps even below it , depending on exact value of pair production efficiency ( see hm01 for details ) .",
    "note , however , that the pc luminosities for the cr cascade derived by arons ( 1981 ) under somewhat different assumptions underestimate the observed @xmath95 by a factor of 100 .",
    "the pc efficiencies expected from the less efficient inverse compton scattering ( ics ) cascade , which may play some role below the cr death line ( see hm02 ) , are aso 1@xmath312 orders of magnitude lower than our observational estimate . therefore , if b1133 lies below the cr death line , then the observed emission is most likely produced in the magnetosphere .    to summarize",
    ", the x - ray spectrum of b1133 can be described by either a nonthermal pl model or a thermal bb model , or a combination of those .",
    "the x - ray parameters of b1133 are particularly close to those of psr b0943 + 10 , which is almost a twin of b1133 + 16 in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath41 also .",
    "the nonthermal x - ray efficiencies of b1133 and other old pulsars generally exceed those of younger pulsars , but it is currently unclear whether this is a genuine property or it is caused by selection effects .",
    "pl fits of old pulsars show , on average , steeper spectra , but this may be caused by the presence of a thermal component .",
    "if the predictions of the current pair cascade models are correct , then either the cr cascade is still operating in b1133 and x - rays are emitted from the heated ns surface , or the bulk of x - ray emission is produced in the pulsar s magnetosphere . since b1133 is a typical representative of the majority of radio pulsars",
