    "cyclic cohomology extends and unifies cohomology theories like de rham cohomology and lie algebra cohomology of matrices .",
    "it has applications e.g. in homological algebra , algebraic topology , lie algebras , algebraic k - theory and so non - commutative differential geometry .",
    "the foot - stone in cyclic cohomology theory is a so called _ cocyclic object _ ,",
    "i.e. a cosimplicial object equipped with an isomorphism at each grade @xmath0 , roughly implementing a cyclic permutation of the coface and codegeneracy morphisms . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath1st power of this cocyclic morphism is required to be the identity .",
    "the study of cocyclic objects , or a quest of their examples , can be divided to two steps .",
    "first one can deal with a more general structure , called a _ para - cocyclic object _",
    ", obtained by relaxing the requirement about the @xmath1st power of the cocyclic morphism at grade @xmath0 to be trivial .",
    "truly cocyclic subobjects or quotients of para - cocyclic objects are then studied as a subsequent step .",
    "there are many known examples of ( para-)cocyclic objects , relevant for various purposes .",
    "a large family of examples , occurring as symmetries in non - commutative differential geometry , is associated to ( co)module ( co)algebras of bialgebras .",
    "the first example of this kind appeared in @xcite where it was used by connes and moscovici to give a geometrical interpretation of the non - commutative chern - character .",
    "further examples of para - cocyclic objects , associated to ( co)module ( co)algebras of hopf algebras were constructed by hajac at al . in @xcite , where also non - trivial coefficients provided by ( co)modules of the hopf algebra were introduced . as a most important achievement ,",
    "also criteria ( on the coefficients ) for the existence of truly cocyclic subobjects and quotients were found .",
    "these constructions were extended to bialgebras ( extending hopf algebras ) by kaygun in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a new type of coefficients , so - called contramodules , was proposed by brzeziski in @xcite . in this way , currently there are known eight families of para - cocyclic objects associated to bialgebras : a cosimplicial object can be constructed from a module algebra or a comodule algebra , or from a module coalgebra or a comodule coalgebra @xmath2 ( yielding four possibilities ) , using either a functor of the form @xmath3 or a functor of the form @xmath4 ( doubling the number of examples ) . in each case there turns out to be an appropriate choice of the coefficients resulting in a para - cocyclic structure .",
    "dually to ( para-)cocyclic objects , one may consider ( para-)cyclic objects , i.e. ( para- ) cocyclic objects in the opposite category .",
    "using bialgebras , there can be constructed again eight families of examples .",
    "as it was observed by connes in @xcite , the category of cyclic objects and the category of cocyclic objects in a given category are isomorphic .",
    "this isomorphism , called _ cyclic duality _ , does not extend to the categories of para - cyclic and para - cocyclic objects only to their appropriate subcategories .",
    "these ( full ) subcategories have those objects whose para-(co)cyclic morphisms are isomorphisms at each grade , cf .",
    "khalkhali and rangipour s work @xcite .    for para-(co)cyclic objects associated to ( co)module ( co)algebras of bialgebras , the para-(co)cyclic morphisms are not isomorphisms in general .",
    "they are isomorphisms , however , if the bialgebra in question is a hopf algebra with an invertible antipode . in this case",
    "the eight families of associated para - cocyclic objects and the eight families of para - cyclic objects turn out to be pairwise related by cyclic duality .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a general construction of para-(co)cyclic objects , including in particular existing constructions in terms of bialgebras together with their generalizations to bialgebroids , cf .",
    "we do _ not _ investigate here , however , the existence of truly ( co)cyclic subobjects or quotients .    an important antecedent work of similar aims is kaygun s paper @xcite , where a universal construction of para-(co)cyclic objects , including examples from bialgebras , was presented .",
    "the construction in this work is built on monoids and comonoids in symmetric monoidal categories .",
    "therefore , while it is perfectly suitable to describe ( co)module ( co)algebras of bialgebras , it has to be generalized in order to be able to cope with bialgebroids over non - commutative base algebras .",
    "such a generalization ( under the names _ admissible septuple _ and its _ transposition map _ ) was proposed in our previous work @xcite . in section [ sec : cat_a ] of the current paper we introduce a category in which admissible septuples and their transposition maps are special objects .",
    "this newly introduced category @xmath5 comes equipped with a functor @xmath6 from @xmath5 to the category of para - cocyclic objects in the category of functors . as a consequence ,",
    "any object in @xmath5 induces a functor from a category ( of coefficients ) to the category of para-(co)cyclic objects in another category ( usually the category of modules over a commutative ring ) .",
    "thus the resulting construction of para-(co)cyclic modules is functorial for the choice of coefficients .    behind the construction of the above category @xmath5",
    "there are some 2-categorical considerations .",

    "the identity morphism of any object @xmath49 is denoted by the same symbol @xmath49 . in order to simplify some computations",
    ", we shall use the string representation of functors and their natural transformations . throughout this paper ,",
    "the composition of functors is represented by horizontal juxtaposition of strings , the functor acting first being represented by the rightmost string .",
    "a natural transformation @xmath59 will be represented as a ` microchip ' with @xmath0 inputs @xmath60 at its top and @xmath61 outputs @xmath62 at its bottom .",

    "the composition of natural transformations is represented by vertical juxtaposition of the corresponding ` layers ' .",

    "horizontal and vertical compositions in a 2-category are represented by horizontal and vertical juxtapositions of such diagrams .",
    "diagrams like the rightmost one above , come from the middle four interchange law .",
    "note that in the literature the dual diagrammatic notation is used equally frequently . in that case ,",
    "our strings representing 1-cells are replaced by the orthogonal lines  hence surfaces on the sides of the original lines are replaced by source and target points of the new orthogonal lines ; and source and target points of the original lines are replaced by surfaces on the sides of the the new orthogonal lines . in this notation 2-cells are represented by labels of the faces surrounded by their domain and codomain 1-cells .",
