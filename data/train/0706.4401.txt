    "in the poland - scheraga free energy approach , bubbles are introduced as free energy changes to the double - helical ground state , such that the disruption of each additional base pair of a bubble requires to cross an energetic barrier that is rewarded by an entropy gain . while the persistence length of double - stranded dna is rather large ( of the order of 50 nm ) and it is assumed to have no configurational entropy , the single - stranded bubbles are flexible , and therefore behave like a polymer ring . the poland - scheraga partition factor for a single bubble in a homopolymer is of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 counts the ( discrete ) number of broken base pairs , and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 $ ] , is the boltzmann factor for breaking the stacking interactions when disrupting an additional base pair . the cooperativity factor",

    "@xmath7 is of the order of 8000 cal / mol , corresponding to approximately 13 @xmath8 at @xmath9c .",
    "occasionally , somewhat smaller values for @xmath10 are assumed , down to approximately 8 @xmath8 .",
    "bubbles below the melting point of dna are therefore rare events .",
    "typical equilibrium melting temperatures of dna for standard salt conditions are in the range @xmath11c , depending on the relative content of weaker at and stronger gc watson - crick base pairs .",
    "thus , double - stranded dna denatures at much higher temperatures as many proteins .",
    "note that the melting temperature of dna can also be increased by change of the natural winding , as opening of the double - strand in ring dna is coupled with the creation of superstructure ; this is the case , for instance , in underwater bacteria living in hot vents , compare ref .",
    "@xcite , and references therein .    due to the large value of @xmath10 , below the melting temperature to good approximation",

    "our results are meant to apply to such typical single molecule setups . in comparison to the rather high energy barrier @xmath7 , according to which the opening of a bubble corresponds to a nucleation process , to break the stacking of a single pair of base pairs requires much less thermal activation , ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 @xmath8 for ta / at and gc / cg pairs of base pairs at @xmath9c , respectively ; here , the positive sign refers to a thermodynamically stable state .",
    "these comparatively low values for the stacking free energy of base pairs stems from the fact that stacking enthalpy cost and entropy release on base pair disruption almost cancel .",
