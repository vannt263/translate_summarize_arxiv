    "the main goal of our project is to derive a representative sample of nearby isolated galaxies useful for testing galaxy evolution in low density regions of the local universe . at present",
    ", there are only two all - sky samples of isolated galaxies : a list of 197 galaxies in the local volume (= lv , @xmath1 10 mpc ) with negative tidal indexes ( karachentsev et al . , 2004 ) , and a catalog of 3227 2mass - selected isolated galaxies ( karachentseva et al . , 2010 = 2mig ) compiled in a similar manner as the catalog of isolated galaxies on the northern sky ( karachentseva , 1973 = kig ) .",
    "both the last catalogs have a typical depth of @xmath280 mpc . to fill up the gap between lv and 2mig , we create a new sample of `` local orphan galaxies '' situated in the local supercluster within @xmath1 45 mpc .",
    "we tested on isolation @xmath210500 galaxies with radial velocities in the local group rest frame @xmath0 km / s situated at galactic latitudes @xmath3 .",
    "first , we cleaned spurious data arrived from automated sky surveys : sdss , 2df , 6df , deep2 , etc . , then determined @xmath4-magnitudes and morphological type if absent .",
    "the observed @xmath5- band magnitudes were transformed into @xmath6 ones to derive the @xmath7-band luminosity of the galaxies .",
    "we bound the galaxies in systems based on the following algorithm , which tooks into account individual properties of galaxies .",
    "thus , two arbitrary galaxies were considered as a pair if their mutual radial velocity @xmath8 and projected separation @xmath9 satisfy the condition of negative total energy : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total mass of the pair .",
    "we use also the second condition that the pair components locate inside their `` zero - velocity '' sphere : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hubble constant . here",
    "we determined masses of galaxies from their @xmath7-band luminosity , assuming one and the same ratio @xmath14 with a dimentionless parameter @xmath15 .",
    "this quantity corresponds to the mean cosmic ratio of dark - to - luminous matter .",
    "we identified all pairs satisfying conditions ( 1)(3 ) and then grouped all pairs with a common component into a single entity . as a result",
    ", we created the catalogs of binary galaxies ( karachentsev & makarov , 2008 ) , triple galaxies ( makarov & karachentsev , 2009 ) , and members of groups ( makarov & karachentsev , 2010 ) .",
    "this algorithm leaves 46% of galaxies as not clusterized , `` field '' ones .",
    "apparently , the higher adopted quantity @xmath16 , the lower fraction of field galaxies .",
    "increasing the @xmath16 in 40 times , we derived a fraction of isolated galaxies to be 10% .",
    "finally , we applied to them the karachentseva s ( 1973 ) criterion of isolation and obtained the sample of 513 local orphan galaxies ( logs ) .",
    "our subsequent spectral observations of neighbouring galaxies around the logs manifest ( melnyk et al . ,",
    "2009 ) that most of them turn out to be background objects with a median difference of radial velocities + 9400 km / s regarding to logs .",
    "we conclude that our sample amounts to ( 85 - 90)% true , spatially well isolated galaxies .",
    "distribution of the isolated galaxies on the sky in equatorial coordinates is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the sky distribution looks quite smooth without prominent over- and under - densities in the regions of known clusters / voids .",
    "fig.2 presents the distribution of radial velocities of the galaxies within bins of 250 km / s .",
    "the shaded histogram is for galaxies detected in iras .",
    "the sample of logs is dominated by flat , bulgeless galaxies ( fig.4 ) .",
    "about 75% of the sample are late type objects ( t @xmath17sc ) with a peak at t = 8 ( sdm ) .",
    "notice that the log galaxies seen in iras have a wider peak at t = 4  6 .",
    "being the distance limited ( but not flux - limited ) sample , the log catalog is over - represented by dwarf galaxies in comparison with kig and 2mig samples .",
    "fig.5 demonstrates distribution of logs according to their @xmath7-magnitudes and hi- fluxes in the logariphmic scale .",
    "the diagonal lines indicate the total gas - to - stellar mass ratio equal to : 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 , 10 and 100 .",
    "most of the logs are gas - rich galaxies with the median @xmath18 .",
    "the e and s0 galaxies , like their nearest representator ngc 404 , amounts to a minor ( 4% ) fraction of logs .",
    "they stand out against normal e and s0 galaxies situated in groups and clusters by a low median luminosity ( @xmath19 ) and the presence of gas and dust .",
    "we found among logs about 20 objects having peculiar structures : distorted / asymmetric shape or tails that can be interpreted as a result of recent merging or current interaction with a massive unvisible body ( dark sub - halo ) .",
    "such well isolated but peculiar objects deserve closer attention to understand their kinematics and structure ."
