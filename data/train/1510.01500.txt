    "discrete groups isometries of the complex hyperbolic @xmath0-space ( @xmath1 ) are natural generalisations of fuchsian groups from the context of the poincar disc to the one of the complex unit ball in @xmath2 .",
    "they are far from having been studied as much as their cousins from the real hyperbolic space .",
    "the first works in that direction go back to the end of the nineteeth century , with works of picard for instance . between that moment and the 1970 s",
    "the subject has not been very active , in spite of works of giraud around 1920 and e. cartan in the 1930 s .",
    "the subject was brought back into light in the late 1970 s by mostow s interest to it and his article @xcite , related to the question of arithmeticity of lattices in symmetric spaces . during the 1980 s goldman and millson adressed the question of the deformations of lattices from pu(@xmath0,1 ) to pu(@xmath3,1 ) , and proved their local rigidity theorem ( see @xcite ) . in this article",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the frame of the complex hyperbolic plane , that is when @xmath4 .",
    "one of the first problems one encounters is to be able to produce representative examples of discrete subgroups in pu(2,1 ) .",
    "this question is related for instance to the construction of polyhedra , that arise as fundamental domains for discrete groups .",
    "the construction of a polyhedron is made difficult by the fact that no totally geodesic hypersurfaces exist in @xmath5 ( indeed , the complex hyperbolic space has non - constant negative curvature ) . under the influence of goldman and then falbel , parker and schwartz among others , methods to overcome",
    "that difficulty have been developed since the early 1990 s ( see for instance @xcite ) , and the collection of known examples of discrete subgroups of pu(@xmath6,1 ) has expanded . however , a general theory for these groups is still not known .    the goal of this article is to present a few results and methods used in the study of subgroups of pu(2,1 ) , through the scope of 2-generator subgroups , that is representations of the rank 2 free group @xmath7 to pu(2,1 ) .",
    "the reason for this choice is that most of the known examples are in fact related to 2-generator subgroups , mostly because they are relatively easy to describe algebraically .",
    "the main general reference on complex hyperbolic geometry is bill goldman s book @xcite . in the article",
    "@xcite , complex hyperbolic space appears as one the the possible hyperbolic spaces over various fields .",

    "] , i describe some constraints ( or their absence ) on conjugacy classes .",
    "section [ section - discrete ] is concerned with the question of discreteness of a subgroup of pu(2,1 ) .",

    "the siegel model of @xmath5 is also often referred to as the _ paraboloid model_. the vector @xmath23 projects onto the only point in its closure which is not contained in this affine chart .",
    "we will denote this vector by @xmath24 , and refer to the corresponding point as @xmath25 .",

    ", picking another hermitian leads to another system of coordinates on the complex hyperbolic plane , which is projectively equivalent to these .",
    "it is often useful to do so to adapt coordinates to a specific problem ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in the siegel model ,",
    "any point of @xmath5 admits a unique standard lift given by @xmath29 the triple @xmath30 is called the horospherical coordinates of a point : horospheres based at @xmath25 are the level sets of @xmath31 .",

    "detailed information on these two models of the complex hyperbolic plane can be found in chapters 3 and 4 of @xcite .",
    "an important feature of complex hyperbolic plane is that it does not contain any ( real ) codimension-1 totally geodesic subspace .",
    "this is crucial when one wants to construct fundamental domains for a subgroups of pu(2,1 ) , as it makes the construction of polyhedra very difficult .",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that the real sectional curvature of @xmath5 is non constant ( it is pinched between @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the normalisation we have chosen here ) .",
    "the maximal totally geodesic subspaces come in two types :    1 .",
    "complex lines are intersections of projective lines of @xmath8 with @xmath5 ( when non - empty ) .",
    "the duality associated with the hermitian form provides a correspondence between the set of complex lines of @xmath5 and the outside @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , any complex line @xmath37 is the intersection with @xmath5 of the projection to @xmath8 of the kernel of a linear form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a positive type vector .",
    "such a vector @xmath39 is called _ polar _ to @xmath37 and is unique up to scaling .",
    "2 .   real planes are totally geodesic totally real subspaces of @xmath5 . using a hermitian form with real coefficients as @xmath15 or @xmath16 , real planes are images under pu(2,1 ) of the set of real points of the considered projective model of complex hyperbolic space .",
    "in particular , they are the fixed point sets of _ real reflections_. the standard example of a real reflection is complex conjugation @xmath40 , which is an isometry .    the two kinds of totally geodesic subspaces realise the extrema of the sectional curvature : it is @xmath35 for real planes and @xmath34 for complex lines .      as usual , there are three mutually exclusive isometry types : loxodromic , elliptic and parabolic , depending on the location of fixed points .",

    "its conjugacy class is determined by the ( unordered ) pair @xmath45 .",
    "these two angles correspond to the rotation angles of the restriction of the elliptic to its stable complex lines .",
    "whenever two of the eigenvalues are equal , the action of @xmath42 on the unit ball is given ( up to conjugacy ) by one of the following maps @xmath46 we refer to the first case as a _ complex reflection about a line _ ( in the first axis of coordinates is fixed ) , and to the second as a _ complex reflection about a point _",

    "one of the two continuous families leads to mostow s examples , and the other one to subgroups of mostow s groups .",
    "it should be noted that the resolution of these trigonometric equations is not trivial and makes use of a result of conway and jones on sums of cosines of rational multiples of @xmath307 ( see theorem 3.1 of @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "this illustrates in particular the fact that finding an efficient parametrisation of a given family of groups is often difficult .    in @xcite ,",

    "the crucial part of the work is the construction of a fundamental domain for the action of each of these groups on @xmath5 .    1 .   the ten sporadic groups are neither commensurable to one another , nor to any of mostow s of deligne and mostow s groups .",
    "the invariant used to tell apart the commensurability classes is the trace field of the adjoint representation of the considered groups ( see section 8 of @xcite ) .",

    "deraux , parker and paupert have proposed a new way of constructing fundamental domains for higher order triangle groups .",
    "regardless of the method used to construct a fundamental domain , the main difficulty is to analyse and check the combinatorics of the constructed polyhedron .",
    "the advantage of the method used in @xcite is that it produces a polyhedron which is bounded by a finite number of pieces of bisectors .",
    "this is in contrast with dirichlet s method where the number of faces could be infinite .",
    "moreover , the fact that only bisectors are involved as 3-faces makes the description of their intersection simpler than if one uses `` exotic '' faces .",
    "3 .   using poincar s polyhedron theorem , the above authors are able to provide a presentation by generators and relations for each of the lattices studied .",
    "they also compute the orbifold euler characteristic of the corresponding quotients of @xmath5 .",

    "we are going to describe representations of @xmath244 to pu(2,1 ) such that @xmath546 is parabolic .",
    "to do so , we need first to specify the conjugacy classes we choose for @xmath547 and @xmath548 .",

    "the main result of @xcite is concerned with those representations obtained by from an @xmath264-fuchsian one by bending of the same angle @xmath77 along each edge of the ideal triangulation .",

    "there is a slight inacuracy in the above two statements .",
    "if one starts from an arbitrary ideal triangulation of @xmath189 , then one obtains a representation of @xmath307 in isom(@xmath5 ) : some elements of @xmath307 can be mapped to antiholomorphic isometries . if one wants to obtain a representation in pu(2,1 ) , one needs to start from a bipartite triangulation .",
