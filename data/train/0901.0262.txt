    "brans - dicke(bd ) theory @xcite is perhaps the most common alternative theory to the einstein s general relativity .",
    "this theory contains both mach s principle and dirac s large number hypothesis .",
    "the theory has recently received interest as it arises naturally as the low energy limit of many theories of quantum gravity such as the supersymmetric string theory or kaluza - klein theory , and is also found to be consistent with present cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "the theory contains an adjustable parameter , @xmath1 , that represents the strength of the coupling between matter and the scalar field . for certain values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the bd theory agrees with gr in the post - newtonian limit up to any desired accuracy and hence weak - field observations can not rule out the bd theory in favor of general relativity @xcite , although the singularity problem remains .    shortly after the appearance of this theory one of its authors , c. brans",
    ", obtained the statically spherically symmetric solutions @xcite . since then many authors have investigated black holes in brans - dicke theory @xcite .",
    "hawking proved in four dimensions the stationary and vacuum brans - dicke solution is just the kerr solution with a constant scalar field everywhere @xcite .",
    "cai and myung have proved that in four dimensions , the charged black hole solution in the brans - dicke - maxwell theory is just the reissner - nordstrom solution with a constant scalar field @xcite .",
    "the kerr - newman type black hole solutions , which are different from the solutions in general relativity , have been constructed for @xmath2 in @xcite .",
    "thermodynamics of black holes in brans - dicke theory is investigated @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the rotating black hole solutions in higher dimensional einstein gravity was found by myers and perry @xcite .",
    "the solutions were uncharged and can be considered as a generalization of the four dimensional kerr solutions .",
    "moreover it has recently been shown that the gravity in higher dimensions contains much richer dynamics than in four dimensions .",
    "as an example , there exists a black ring solution in five dimensions with the horizon topology of @xmath3 @xcite , which has the same mass and angular momentum as the myers - perry solution and therefore contradicts the uniqueness theorem in five dimensions .",
    "although the non - rotating black hole solutions in higher dimensional einstein - maxwell gravity was found many years ago @xcite , the analytic solution of a generalization of the charged myers - perry solution in @xmath4-dimensional einstein maxwell gravity has not been found yet .",
    "solutions of different kinds of charged rotating black holes in higher dimensions have been discussed in the framework of supergravity and string theory @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the solutions of charged rotating black hole in @xmath4-dimensional einstein - maxwell theory with a single rotation parameter in the limit of slow rotation have been constructed .",
    "in addition , @xcite contains a class of charged slowly rotating black hole solutions in gauss - bonnet gravity . rotating black holes in einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity is discussed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate charged slowly rotating black holes in brans - dicke theory by using the conformal transformation between dilaton fields and brans - dicke theory .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section [ ii ] we obtain the solution of charged rotating brans - dicke black holes and discuss their causal structure , then in section [ iii ] we obtain the conserved quantities of the finite action by using the euclidean action and section [ iv ] contains our results .",
    "the action of the brans - dicke - maxwell theory in @xmath4-dimensions with a scalar field @xmath5 and a self - interacting potential @xmath6 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ricci scalar , @xmath9 the electromagnetic tensor field , @xmath10 the vector potential , @xmath1 the coupling constant and @xmath5 is the bd scalar field . by varying the the action ( [ 1 ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath11 , the scalar field @xmath5 and vector field @xmath10 , one can obtain the following field equations @xmath12 @xmath13}f^2+\\frac{1}{2[(n-1)\\omega+n]}\\left[(n-1)\\phi\\frac{dv(\\phi)}{d\\phi } -(n+1)v(\\phi)\\right]\\label{3}\\ ] ] @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the einstein tensor . it is not easy to solve the field equations ( [ 2])-([4 ] ) directly because the right hand side of eq .",

    "fortunately , we can transform these field equations to the dilaton field equations by conformal transformations .",
    "if one uses the following conformal transformations @xmath16 where @xmath17 then the action ( [ 1 ] ) takes the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the ricci scalar and covariant derivative corresponding to the metric @xmath21 and @xmath22 is : @xmath23    eq . (",

    "( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "numerical calculations show that the temperature of the event horizon goes to zero as the black hole approaches an extreme one .",
    "in addition we can show that for @xmath88 @xmath89 in summary , the metric ( [ 21 ] ) can represent a rotating black hole with two inner and outer horizons located at @xmath90 and @xmath91 provided that the mass parameter m is greater than @xmath92 , an extreme black hole when @xmath93 , and a naked singularity when @xmath94 .",
    "the electric potential @xmath95 , measured at infinity with respect to the horizon , is defined by @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath85 is the null generator of the event horizon .",

    "the adm ( arnowitt - deser - misner ) mass @xmath99 , entropy @xmath100 and electric potential @xmath95 of the topological black hole can be calculated through the use of the euclidean action method @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the electrical potential and the temperature are initially fixed on a boundary with a fixed radius @xmath90 .",
    "the euclidean action has two parts ; bulk and surface .",
    "the first step to make the euclidean action is to substitute @xmath39 with @xmath101 ( this change does not affect our physical parameters , especially the angular momentum , see eq .",

    "in addition , in the context of bd gravity , where we have the additional gravitational scalar degree of freedom , the entropy of the black hole does not follow the area law .",
    "this is due to the fact that the black hole entropy comes from the boundary term in the euclidean action formalism .",
