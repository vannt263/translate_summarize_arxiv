    "the possibility to produce strong electric fields of the order of @xmath3  gv / m with present laser facilities is a great advantage for laser - wakefield accelerators  @xcite which allows , in principle , to construct compact accelerating devices for particle and nuclear physics .",
    "the successful production of high - quality electron beams in such laser - driven accelerators with electron energies of the order of 1 gev has been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "electron beams with energies exceeding @xmath4  gev are interesting for many applications in particle physics , such as investigating the properties and production mechanisms of vector and exotic scalar mesons in photo / electroproduction  @xcite , excitation of baryon resonances with the aim of studying their properties and search for missing resonances  @xcite , strangeness photoproduction  @xcite etc .",

    "therefore , it is interesting to estimate whether the high - energy laser - driven electrons can produce a sizeable amount of muon pairs for future applications .",
    "recall that the present generation of the high - energy neutrino beams are made by decays of charged pions and kaons in flight in a long decay channel . in this case",
    ", the neutrino ( antineutrino ) beams mostly consists of @xmath7 with rather small admixture of electron neutrinos .",
    "the idea to use a storage ring of muons as a source of high - energy and high - intensity neutrino beam has been discussed in refs .",
    "it is assumed that the muons are produced in two - body decays @xmath8 and @xmath9 and then stored in a ring with subsequent decay into an electron and two neutrinos .",
    "the pions ( kaons ) in turn , are produced in proton - proton and ( or ) in proton - nucleus collisions with high - intensity proton beams  @xcite .",
    "together with neutrino oscillation , such high - intensity muon sources may be used in studying other fundamental problems of lepton physics , say the search for lepton flavor violation  @xcite and the measurement of the muon s anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "the idea to use a laser - driven proton beam for investigating different aspects of the neutrino oscillations was discussed for the first time in ref .",

    "the aim of present paper is to analyze the possibility of muon pair creation in the interaction of high - energy laser driven electrons within a heavy ( high-@xmath1 ) target in a table top configuration .",
    "the electromagnetic sources of the @xmath0 ( dimuon ) production are described by the following elementary processes @xmath10 in the first case ( 1 ) the dimuons are produced in the interaction of real ( bremsstrahlung ) photons within the electric field of the high-@xmath1 target nuclei .",

    "using the above elementary cross sections one can estimate the dimuon yield for given electron beam and target properties . for the former ones we use the conditions of electron beams as reported for the laser - wakefield accelerator in ref .",

    ", we neglect the energy spread in the bunch taking the electron energy at the central positions of the energy distribution .",
    "this seems to be reasonable , because the energy spreading reported in  @xcite is less than 100  mev at @xmath86  gev .    propagating through the target material",
    "the electron beam loses its intensity and energy .",
    "the energy loss is described by  @xcite @xmath87 with @xmath88  cm . for the gold target with @xmath89 and @xmath90",

    "( [ e42 ] ) is much smaller than @xmath95 .",
    "the yield of dimuons , produced by secondary real photons created at the distance @xmath101 behind the target front side , reads @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the above cross section of the dimuon production in the elementary @xmath35 interaction , and @xmath104 denotes the distribution of bremsstrahlung photons with energy @xmath105 at distance @xmath101 @xmath106 where @xmath107 is defined by eq .",

    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "the total number of dimuons produced in @xmath36 interactions is about 1 and 60 for @xmath115 and 10  gev , respectively for thick target .",
    "the yield increases with the thickness of the target . some saturation sets in at @xmath116  cm .",
    "this means that the dimuons are essentially produced in a narrow region of the target mostly because of the large energy loss .",
    "it seems to be natural , because the saturation length @xmath117 is close to the scale parameter @xmath100 in eq .",
    "( [ e42 ] ) .",
    "the number of dimuons in @xmath35 interactions is about 200 and 6000 for @xmath115 and 10  gev , respectively , for target thickness of 1  cm .",
    "the dependence of the total yield on the target thickness is rather strong due to the large main free path of the bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "the dimuon yield in @xmath73 interactions considerably exceeds the corresponding yield in @xmath36 interactions .",
    "this excess strongly depends on the target thickness .",
    "therefore , in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] we present the total dimuon yield in interactions of relativistic electrons with a gold target which is a sum of the two above contributions as a function of the primary electron energy @xmath114 and target thickness @xmath118 .        for thick targets it practically coincides with the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ]  ( right panel ) .",
    "finally , let us consider the hadronic sources of muons in interactions of the laser - wakefield accelerated electrons with the thick target .",
    "the main source of muons here is the photo and/or electro production and subsequent decay of @xmath119 mesons in the elementary processes @xmath120 where @xmath49 stands for real bremsstrahlung photons ( photoproduction ) or virtual photons ( electroproduction ) .",
    "the production of @xmath121 mesons by 1 gev electrons is strongly suppressed because of energy arguments , however , at higher energies they contribute to the muon production similarly to the pions . charged pions decay via @xmath122 with a probability of 99.99% .",
    "the cross sections of the reactions ( [ e8a ] ) and ( [ e8b ] ) for @xmath123  gev are around 100  @xmath16b ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "pion photoproduction in @xmath35 reactions is proportional to @xmath124 .",
    "this means that the cross section of the muon production at heavy target nuclei by @xmath125 reactions exceeds the dimuon photoproduction , considered in previous section , by a factor of @xmath126 .",
    "taking into account the large pion absorption cross section at heavy target nuclei by strong interaction processes this means that the produced pions will be essentially absorbed in a thick target .",
    "the target must be thin enough to get a well collimated muon beam .",
    "this condition reduces the muon yield considerably .",
    "for example , for a dozen  @xmath16 m thick gold target the expected yield of @xmath2 muons is less than 1 event for the above considered electron bunch .",
    "therefore , the direct production of dimuons in electromagnetic interactions seems to be a more favorable mechanism .",
    "in summary we have considered muon pairs production by gev electrons , created by a laser wakefield accelerator , impinging on a thick high-@xmath1 target .",
    "we estimated the effectiveness of a such a source of muon pairs .",
    "for a 1 cm thick gold target , @xmath127 electrons in a 20 pc bunch with energy of 1 ( 10 )  gev in the initial state produce about @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) dimuons with pair energies centered at 1  gev . to get @xmath130 dimuons from the muon factory one needs @xmath131 primary electrons in a bunch .",
    "such intensities with power of 100  j seem to be quite realistic in near future , requiring ultra - high intensity laser pulses with efficient acceleration mechanisms .",
    "cooling of the heat load in the target material analog to ref .",
    "@xcite may be an option for higher repetition rates .",
    "the produced muons , unlike electrons and hadrons , penetrate the target material without suffering noticeable scattering and absorption .",
    "thus the configuration of a laser driven electron accelerator and thick high-@xmath1 target may serve as an all - optics table top device for muon pair production . the produced @xmath16 mesons may be used in studying various aspects of muon and neutrino physics and to be considered as an important step towards investigations of more complicated electron induced elementary processes .",
