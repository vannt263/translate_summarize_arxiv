    "the eso supernovae ia progenitor survey ( spy ) aimed to find double - degenerate binaries in close orbits @xcite .",
    "the merger of two white dwarfs is considered to be one of the processes , which could lead to a supernovae type ia ( sn ia ) explosion . a large spectroscopic survey of 1000 white dwarf ( wd ) candidates was undertaken using the uves spectrograph at the 8-m eso vlt ut2 ( kueyen ) to search for radial velocity ( rv ) variable wds .",
    "about 140 hot subdwarfs of various types were included .",
    "hot subdwarf b stars ( sdbs ) are considered to be core helium - burning stars with very thin hydrogen envelopes which are situated on the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) .",
    "the formation of sdbs is still unclear .",
    "different formation channels have been discussed @xcite . as it turned out , a large fraction of the sdb stars are members of short - period binaries @xcite . for these systems",
    "common - envelope ejection is the most probable formation channel .",
    "hot subdwarf binaries therefore provide a suitable population to study this very important , but still poorly understood phase of stellar evolution .",
    "most companions of sdbs in such systems are white dwarfs ( wds ) or late type main - sequence ( ms ) stars @xcite .",
    "close binary sdb+wd systems , which exceed the chandrasekhar mass , turned out to be good candidates for double - degenerate progenitors of snia @xcite .",
    "measuring the orbits of close binary sdbs is therefore necessary to study common - envelope evolution and a prerequisite for more detailed studies to constrain the system parameters .",
    "the programme stars were observed at least twice in the course of the spy project with the high - resolution echelle spectrograph uves at the esovlt ( 20002002 ) .",
    "follow - up observations were undertaken with the medium resolution spectrograph emmi at the eso ntt in june 2007 .",
    "reduction was done with the eso  midas package .",
    "the radial velocities ( rv ) were measured by fitting a set of mathematical functions ( gaussians , lorentzians and polynomials ) to the hydrogen balmer lines using the fitsb2 routine @xcite .",
    "sine curves were fitted to the rv data using single - value decomposition , a @xmath0 minimising method , and the power spectrum was generated .",
    "lllllll & @xmath1 & @xmath2 & @xmath3 & @xmath4 & + & [ d ] & [ @xmath5 & [ @xmath6 & [ @xmath6 & + wd0107@xmath7342 & @xmath8 & @xmath9 & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & sdb+ms / wd + he1415@xmath70309 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 & sdb+wd + he1423@xmath70119 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath10 & sdo+ms / wd +    all three binaries presented here are single - lined systems .",
    "this yields an upper limit for the mass of a late main sequence companion of @xmath19 , which should otherwise be visible in the spectrum .",
    "he1415@xmath70309 has a very short period and high radial velocity amplitude .",
    "the minimum mass of the secondary exceeds @xmath19 and therefore excludes a main sequence companion .",
    "it is very near the average mass of da white dwarfs ( @xmath20 ; * ? ? ?",
    "a high inclination is therefore probable and the system could be eclipsing .",
    "he1415@xmath70309 is likely to be an sdb+wd binary , but a heavy compact companion can not be ruled out .",
    "he1423@xmath70119 is a hydrogen rich sdo star in a close orbit . due to its low minimum mass",
    "the companion may be a late - type ms star . in this case",
    ", a reflection effect may be detectable in the lightcurve .",
    "the minimum companion mass of wd0107@xmath7342 is compatible with a wd as well as a late ms star .",
    "assuming orbital synchronization of the binary and measuring the subdwarfs projected rotational velocity @xmath21 from high resolution spectra , it is possible to derive the inclination of the system as well as the companion mass . in this case",
    "the companion is most likely a heavy white dwarf and wd0107@xmath7342 becomes a viable candidate for a sn ia explosion ( see geier et al .",
    "these proceedings ) .",
    "the results presented here should be considered to be preliminary .",
    "as can be seen from the rv curves , more data points are needed to get better phase coverage , in particular for he1415@xmath70309 and he1423@xmath70119 .",
    "in the course of the spy survey 18 radial velocity variable subdwarfs were discovered .",
    "the orbital parameters of 12 close binary subdwarfs have already been determined @xcite .",
    "the goal of our project is to measure the orbital parameters of all rv variable subdwarfs from the spy survey .",
    "additional ntt time was granted for period 80 in january 2008 .    to constrain the nature of the companions further",
    ", light curves have to be taken .",
    "if the companions are main - sequence stars , they should be detectable from light variation due to the reflection effect .",
    "as an example we mention he0230@xmath74323 , an sdb binary with a period of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the companion is a main - sequence star by measuring the reflection effect .",
    "this star is of particular interest because other , yet unexplained light variations have been discovered as well .",
