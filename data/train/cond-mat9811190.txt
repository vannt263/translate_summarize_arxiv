    "initial proposals of odd parity superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 were founded on the itinerant ferromagnetism of related ruthenate compounds and on the similarities between sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and @xmath15he in the fermi liquid corrections produced by electronic correlations@xcite .",
    "recently , muon spin rotation ( @xmath4sr ) measurements@xcite have observed that a spontaneous magnetization begins to develop below @xmath16 .",
    "this finding is most naturally explained in terms of a time reversal ( @xmath17 ) symmetry breaking state implying a multiple component representation of the @xmath14 point group .",
    "furthermore , since the electronic structure of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is quasi - two dimensional , a gap function with a strong @xmath18-dependence is unlikely . of the remaining two odd or even two - component representations of @xmath14 , the odd @xmath19 representation with basis functions",

    "band structure calculations@xcite reveal that the density of states near the fermi surface is mainly due to the four ru 4@xmath34 electrons , which hybridize strongly with the o 2@xmath2 orbitals and give rise to three bands crossing the fermi surface , labeled @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( see ref . ) . within the model of orbital dependent superconductivity @xcite",

    "we investigate the single vortex core structure and the geometry of the vortex lattice near the lower critical field @xmath3 .",

    ", bitter decoration studies near @xmath3 can be used to detect the predicted field dependent transition between hexagonal and square lattice , which would complete the picture found by sans - measurements for higher applied fields@xcite .",
    "a further characteristic of the hex - to - square transition is the peak splitting in the field distribution calculated in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] and measurable in @xmath4sr experiments .",

    "the free energy @xmath43 is invariant under a simultaneous rotation of @xmath64 around the @xmath33-axis and changing sign of @xmath65 .",
    "this implies that all results derived below for @xmath66 can be transformed into the corresponding results for positive @xmath67 by a simple rotation , and we limit ourselves to the case @xmath66 .",

    "the asymptotic vorticity of the dominant @xmath72-component then determines the field direction along the positive or negative @xmath68-axis . in the spatially inhomogeneous situations considered below , the second component @xmath73 is driven through the mixed gradient terms [ gradient terms such as @xmath74 and decays far away from the defect .",
    "note , that to each solution @xmath75 a symmetric counterpart with reversed field direction exists @xmath76    below , we first examine the asymptotic solutions of the gl - equations for @xmath63 .",
    "second , we use the @xmath63-solution and carry out perturbation theory in @xmath65 to obtain the asymptotic solutions for @xmath77 ( we ignore the coupling to the vector potential in the latter case ) .    in the cylindrical case ( @xmath63 )",
    "the problem exhibits rotational symmetry . restricting to fields @xmath78 , the solution has the structure @xmath79 where @xmath80 are polar coordinates and @xmath81 denotes the phase winding of the topological defect driving the vortex in the main superconducting component .",
    "the relative phase @xmath82 between @xmath72 and @xmath73 corresponds to an angular momentum difference @xmath83 and comes in through the specific form @xmath84 of the mixed gradient terms for @xmath63 .",
    "the solutions for @xmath85 are the most stable ones .",
    "the small @xmath86 expansion to cubic order takes the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are the first expansion coefficients of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath91 , to be determined by matching this small @xmath86 expansion to the asymptotics at @xmath92 .",
    "the latter reads @xmath93 where the @xmath94 stands for @xmath85 .",
    "the asymptotic form of the gl - equations requires the three functions @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 to be of the form @xmath98 if we ignore the vector potential @xmath99 . for the general case ( @xmath100 ) the main asymptotics is an exponential decay @xmath101 which is a consequence of transverse screening . from fig .",
    "[ expofig ] we see , that for reasonably large @xmath42 this exponent @xmath102 approaches 1 , which equals the usual penetration depth in dimensionless units .",
    "we proceed now with the anisotropic case @xmath103 ( here we neglect the vector potential ) .",
    "an expansion to first order in @xmath65 produces the following result for small @xmath86 @xmath104 and for large @xmath86 @xmath105 the additional coefficients @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the first expansion coefficients of the higher angular momentum states ( @xmath107 from @xmath108 and @xmath107 from @xmath109 ) , which arise for @xmath77 . comparing the condensation energy for the two cases @xmath110 we find that the @xmath111-case is the more stable : the admixed @xmath73 order parameter rises linearly in the center rather than cubic as is the case for @xmath112 , and the asymptotic phase turns of @xmath73 are the same in the center and for large @xmath86 ( which is also an argument against off - centered zeroes as seen for example in @xmath113-superconductors ) .",
    "both points lead to a higher gain in condensation energy , which should stabilize the @xmath111-solution .",
    "our numerical ginzburg - landau results ( described in the next paragraph ) for the critical fields @xmath114 confirm this finding : for @xmath115 and @xmath116 , we obtain @xmath117 demonstrating the stability of the @xmath111-solution compared to @xmath118 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath119-wave result is @xmath120 .    to obtain complete numerical solutions ,",
    "we minimize the free energy density on a two - dimensional grid .",
    "the minimization is carried out by relaxing an initial configuration @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 iteratively .",
    "indeed we find that the energetically favorable @xmath111-solution shows no off - centered zeroes in @xmath73 .",
    "a contour plot of the absolute value of the dominant @xmath72 ( a ) and @xmath73-component ( b ) is displayed in fig .",
    "[ eta - glfig ] .",
    "the admixed @xmath73 solution shows a fourfold structure with a maximal amplitude along the axes .",
    "in addition the vortex core center of the dominant order parameter is distorted with marked elongations along the diagonals of the crystal lattice for @xmath66 ( and analogously along the axes for @xmath67 ) .",
    "this behavior is understood recalling the properties of the fermi surface . for @xmath66 ,",
    "the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi surface is larger along the axes than along the diagonals .",
    "a larger dos however implies also a larger effective mass , which reduces the coherence length and thus the size of the vortex .",
    "finally , the distribution of the absolute value of the @xmath124-field ( see fig .  [ a - glfig ] ) also shows clear square deformations aligned with the underlying crystal lattice .    on the other hand , in the unstable @xmath118-case the admixed component @xmath73 exhibits a negative phase turn around the center , and consequently four off - centered zeroes with positive phase turn are needed to match up this phase @xmath125 at small @xmath86 to the asymptotic phase @xmath126 at large @xmath86",
    "this pattern is qualitatively well known from analog gl - calculations for @xmath119-admixture in @xmath113 high-@xmath16 superconductors@xcite .",
    "the dominant component @xmath72 and the @xmath124-field show similar features as in the stable case discussed above .",
    "we wish to determine the form of the vortex lattice close to @xmath3 . instead of solving the ginzburg - landau free energy directly , here",
    "we follow an idea recently developed in the context of @xmath113-wave superconductors with a weak admixing of an @xmath119-component@xcite .",
    "we first integrate out the admixed component , leading to a one - component free energy density .",
    "we assume @xmath127 and @xmath128 and use london approximation to obtain an effective free energy density which depends only on the field @xmath129 and which can be minimized with respect to the geometry of the vortex lattice .",
    "though our results will be quantitatively inaccurate for the low-@xmath42 sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 material , we still expect to obtain a qualitatively correct picture .    the ginzburg - landau equation for @xmath73 to first order in @xmath130 reads @xmath131 within london theory the dominant component @xmath72 has modulus unity ( see eq .",
    "( [ asf ] ) ) and the first three terms lead to the expression @xmath132 . solving formally for @xmath73 and substituting this expression into the free energy density , we obtain the effective one - component ginzburg - landau free energy @xmath133 with @xmath134 here we have consistently neglected all terms of order @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and higher .",
    "following the usual scheme for london approximation we replace the order parameter @xmath72 and its derivative by the superfluid velocity @xmath137 @xmath138 keeping only terms up to second order in @xmath137 and up to first order in the anisotropy parameter @xmath65 , we obtain the london free energy in fourier representation @xmath139 \\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , all quadratic expressions in @xmath137 and @xmath129 have to be understood as @xmath140 ( the results for vorticity @xmath85 are the same on this level of calculation ; they would differ if one included higher orders in @xmath137 ) .",
    "next , we eliminate @xmath137 .",
    "we obtain an equation connecting @xmath129 and @xmath137 by variation of the london free energy eq .",
