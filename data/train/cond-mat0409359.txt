    "approaching the transition to a superconducting or superfluid state from above , one can ( under certain conditions ) observe incipient macroscopic features which are caused by the emergence of an order parameter .",
    "in classical superconductors such features , related to spatial order parameter fluctuations , are restricted to only an extremely narrow temperature region around the superconducting critical temperature @xmath7 , and in practice are hard to detect at all .",
    "such fluctuations however are visible in systems with real space pairing or , more generally , when the overlap between the pair wave functions is small and we are in the crossover regime between a bcs type superfluidity of cooperons and a superfluid phase of tightly bound fermions which behave as bosons .",
    "remnants of superfluidity , sometimes termed _",
    "localized superfluidity _ , above @xmath8 have been observed @xcite in form of finite range phase correlations in purely bosonic systems such as liquid @xmath9he in porous media of vicors and aerogels , with a characteristic disorder and confinement .",
    "similar features have been seen for fermionic systems such as @xmath10he in aerogels @xcite and superconducting hetero structures @xcite .",
    "solution to the theoretical questions raised in this connection lies in a formulation capable of describing on equal footing a bcs type superconductivity in a system of weakly coupled fermions and a bose einstein condensation ( bec ) of strongly bound fermion pairs .",
    "early attempts to do that go go back to the work of leggett @xcite and nozires and schmitt - rink @xcite and rely on cross - over scenarios where electron pairing is given by some unspecified effective attraction between them .",
    "fermionic systems where the binding between fermions comes about from an exchange interaction between free itinerant fermions and two - fermion bound states , present a different scenario to examine the cross - over regime between a bcs type superfluidity and a condensed states of tightly bound pairs .",
    "such systems have moreover the advantage that sometimes , in real systems , the cross - over can be tuned experimentally .",
    "an example for such scenarios are many polaron systems in the intermediary coupling regime where free itinerant electrons engage in a resonant scattering process with weakly bound bipolaronic states when their respective energy difference is small@xcite .",
    "this leads to long lived electron pairs which ultimately can condensate .",
    "an other example , now widely studied in the literature in connection with their condensation@xcite , are gases of fermionic atomic ( such as @xmath0li and @xmath1k atoms ) which can be brought into such resonant fermionic pair states via a so called feshbach resonance mechanism@xcite which involves hyperfine spin - flip processes between the nuclear and the electronic spins of the atoms together with their molecular counterparts . finally , also in the highly debated scenarios for the high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) resonant pairing between @xmath2-wave holes has been invoked .",
    "there , it has been suggested that such pairing arises from an exchange between itinerant holes and bound hole pairs in plaquette rvb states on finite clusters@xcite .    in all those systems",
    "resonant pairing leads to long lived electron pairs which ultimately are driven into a superfluid phase .",
    "furthermore such systems are characterized by a strongly interdependent dynamics of single- and two - particle excitations which , upon approaching and passing through the superconducting phase transition , simultaneously undergo qualitative changes .",
    "thus , the opening of a pseudogap in the single particle spectrum , when @xmath7 is approached from above , occurs concomitantly with a change - over from single particle fermionic transport to one ensured by bosonic molecular entities @xcite . the observed transient meissner effect @xcite and a nernst effect @xcite in the normal phase in htsc can be considered to be signatures of that . in the atomic gases the physics is more involved because of the strong inhomogeneous character of those trapped gases , leading to radial and axial breathing modes @xcite instead of the usual sound - wave like excitation spectrum known in translational invariant homogeneous superfluids .",
    "nevertheless , corresponding manifestation of superfluid fluctuations in the normal state should also be expected in those systems .    in this paper",
    "we shall analyze the molecular ( and/or fermion - pair ) excitation spectrum of such a general class of systems which can be described in terms of resonating pairs of fermions and discuss how , on a finite length scale , superfluid phase fluctuations can emerge upon approaching @xmath8 from above .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to the study of homogeneous systems , leaving the more complex structures to be expected for remnant collective modes in inhomogeneous atomic gases in optical traps to a future work .",
    "the simplest , and generally adopted approach to study such systems , is on the basis of a phenomenological boson - fermion model .",
    "pairing in such a model can be viewed as the andreev scattering processes between itinerant carriers and bosonic bound pairs on small clusters .",
    "one then is faced on one hand with local intra - cluster phase correlations between pairs of itinerant fermions and bosonic bound fermion pairs and on the other hand with non - local inter - cluster phase correlations @xcite .",
    "the first ones play the role of local density fluctuations and the second ones of effective inter - site josephson coupling .",
    "this physics , which is an intrinsic ingredient of the various representative examples cited above and which are effectively realized in nature , is qualitatively different from that of the standard cross - over scenarios based on effective attractive inter - particle interactions .",
    "it leads to novel features such as superfluid - insulator transitions , and lets one envisage the possibility of normal state bose metals and exotic elementary as well as collective excitations which remain to be fully explored @xcite .",
    "the following boson fermion model ( bfm ) hamiltonian for resonant pairing @xmath11 is currently employed in studies of the above mentioned systems .",
    "the operators @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) correspond , according to the physical system we are studying , to the creation ( annihilation ) of either free electrons , or free itinerant holons or fermionic atoms in one of two possible hyperfine configurations , denoted symbolically by @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the energy @xmath16 of those fermions is measured with respect to the chemical potential @xmath17 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) refer to bound diatomic molecules of bosonic character ( either localized bipolarons , or bound hole pairs on plaquette rvb states or weakly bound pairs of atoms in a triplet configuration ) , having an energy @xmath20 being measured with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the fermi momentum ) , denotes the difference in energy of the weakly bound fermion pairs and the single fermion scattering states .",
    "if @xmath24 is small , pairing will be introduced among the uncorrelated fermions via resonance scattering , tantamount to a boson - fermion pair exchange with coupling strength @xmath25 .",
    "tuning the value of @xmath24 , one can cover the whole regime between cooper pairs and locally bound pairs and their corresponding condensed phases .",
    "such a bfm ( [ bf ] ) has been introduced originally in solid state theory many years ago , in an attempt to describe the situation of intermediary electron - lattice coupling @xcite and has been intensively studied over the last decade , mainly in connection with the pseudogap phenomenon in the htsc . as shown recently @xcite , this model",
    "does indeed capture the resonant - type scattering between fermions due to the feshbach mechanism and has been widely studied in connection with several issues of the atomic gas superfluidity @xcite .",
    "our main objective here is to study the two - fermion dynamical correlation functions when the _ detuning _",
    "@xmath24 from the resonance is small , thus putting ourselves in the center of the cross - over regime between a superfluid ground state of bcs characteristics and one corresponding to tightly bound fermion pairs of bosonic character .",
    "the green s function describing the fermion pairs @xmath26 is related to the single particle boson propagator via @xmath27 , where @xmath28^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this implies that the excitation energies of the bound molecules and fermionic diatomic pairs are _",
    "identical_. only the spectral weights differ as can be seen from the relation between their spectral functions , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "it is thus sufficient to determine one of these functions in order to derive the excitation spectra for both .",
    "the inter - dependence between the single and two - particle correlations requires to treat them on equal footings . for that purpose",
    "we employ a continuous renormalization group procedure@xcite which , through a set of infinitesimal canonical transformations , reduces the initial hamiltonian ( [ bf ] ) to an essentially diagonalizable form , containing the relevant physics which we want to describe , plus additional terms which can be treated as small perturbations .",
    "contrary to standard renormalization group techniques , where one integrates out the high energy states and subsequently derives an effective low energy hamiltonian , in this method both , the high and low energy sectors , are renormalized and kept throughout the whole transformation process .    the specific construction of such a procedure for the bfm was given previously @xcite , where also the single particle spectrum of the fermionic atoms , pointing to bogoliubov - like excitations below as well as above @xmath8 was studied @xcite .",
    "we apply here this procedure for the study of the boson spectral function . in the course of diagonalizing the hamiltonian",
    ", the boson operators evolve toward a form given by @xmath30 the two complex coefficients appearing in ( [ b_ansatz ] ) are calculated in the limit of the convergence of the renormalization flow procedure @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the continuous flow parameter .",
    "we base ourselves on the general relations which describe the evolution of operators@xcite @xmath34   \\label{flow}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 being judiciously chosen @xcite as @xmath36 and @xmath37   v_{{\\bf k},{\\bf p}}(l)$ ] @xcite .",
    "coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath39 satisfy then the renormalization equations @xmath40 with the initial conditions @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this procedure leads finally to the following form of the spectral function for the bosonic molecules @xmath44 the first term of ( [ b_spectral ] ) describes long - lived quasi - particles with the renormalized energy @xmath45 @xcite and whose spectral weight is @xmath46 .",
    "the second term describes the incoherent background extending over the region determined by the renormalized fermion energies @xmath47 @xcite . from equations ( [ a_flow],[b_flow ] )",
    "we derive the following sum rule @xmath48 \\rangle=1 $ ] .",
    "at a certain critical temperature @xmath8 the static pair susceptibility @xmath49 becomes divergent for @xmath50 and , due to the thouless criterion , the system undergoes a phase transition to a superfluid state . for @xmath4 there appear two order parameters which are proportional to each other : @xmath51 for the fermions and @xmath52 for the bosons ( atom molecules ) .",
    "near the fermi energy , the single particle fermionic excitations become gaped : @xmath53 . in consequence ,",
    "no fermionic states , neither coherent nor incoherent , exist within the energy window @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "this simultaneously affects the incoherent part of bosonic spectrum , as can be seen from ( [ b_spectral ] ) . for the long wavelength limit @xmath55",
    "the incoherent background is pushed up to energies @xmath56 and thus permits long - lived excitations , which correspond to collective modes , known as _ first sound _ for interacting bosonic systems in the superfluid state ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of these modes has previously been studied for this bfm @xcite in the superfluid phase within a framework of the dielectric formalism with use of the ward identities , currently employed in the theory of interacting bose gases .",
    "a behavior similar to that of the strong coupling limit of interacting bose gases @xcite was found , showing a sound velocity being little dependent on temperature as one traverses the superfluid transition , but whose spectral weight in the boson single particle spectral function disappears upon approaching @xmath7 .",
    "such sound wave - like modes are not realized in charged superconducting systems because of the long range coulomb interaction which pushes them up to the generally huge plasma frequency @xcite . for electrically neutral atoms , such as the trapped atomic gases ,",
    "this is no longer the case and hence one can realistically expect collective sound wave - like modes , although appropriately modified due to the inhomogeneous structure of the gas density @xcite .",
    "= 7.5 cm    decreasing the temperature in the normal state below a certain @xmath57 one expects precursor pairing effects which show up in the single particle fermionic excitations spectrum in form of a pseudogap which opens up near the chemical potential @xcite . above @xmath58",
    "the low energy part of the pair excitations has the usual parabolic dispersion .",
    "however , upon decreasing the temperature and approaching @xmath7 , phase coherence gradually sets in on a finite length and time scale , which becomes visible in form of a linear in @xmath5 dispersion of the single boson ( respectively fermion pair ) excitation for small @xmath5 vectors , in an interval @xmath59 $ ] ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . there",
    ", the derivative of the effective bose single particle energy spectrum @xmath60 shows a flat portion , which , when extrapolated to @xmath6 , practically coincides with the corresponding quantity in the superfluid phase at @xmath61 .",
    "we observe that , as the temperature is decreased , @xmath3 decreases toward zero , but always leaving a small interval in q space @xmath62 $ ] where one clearly observes a free particle like spectrum with an effective mass which decreases as t decreases .",
    "this is in accordance with an earlier study on this subject using selfconsistent perturbation theory@xcite . for @xmath63",
    "the coherent boson mode overlaps with an incoherent background in the single particle boson spectral function ( see fig.3 , bottom panel ) . yet , upon decreasing the temperature to below @xmath58 , we observe that this incoherent background moves away from the position of the coherent contribution ( upper panel of fig.3 ) which ensures that a linear in @xmath5 branch of the boson spectrum is well defined in the corresponding interval of @xmath5 vectors .",
    "this strongly suggests that remnants of the first sound still can exist as part of the single particle boson spectrum above the superfluid phase transition for a limited region of wave vectors due to a persistence of superfluid phase correlations above @xmath7 on a finite length and time scale .",
    "we studied the qualitative changes of the excitation spectrum for the resonant fermion pairs which occur upon varying the temperature .",
    "we found that quantum fluctuations play a crucial role when detuning @xmath24 from the feshbach resonance is small .",
    "fluctuations manifest themselves in the pseudogap regime @xmath64 .    far above @xmath8",
    "the off - diagonal long range order is not established .",
    "the pair excitation spectrum for small @xmath5 vectors is then characterized by a parabolic branch ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and overlaps with the incoherent background ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
    "3 ) such as to effectively destroy any bosonic quasi - particle features .",
    "this situation changes dramatically when the temperature drops below @xmath65 where resonant pairing sets in .",
    "phase correlations start to build up on a finite spatial and temporal scale as the temperature decreases and approaches @xmath7 .",
    "the single particle fermion spectrum reveals then a partial suppression of states ( pseudogap ) around the fermi energy @xcite , which is accompanied by qualitative changes in the pair excitation spectrum .",
    "quantum fluctuations lead to emergence of the collective sound - wave mode which above @xmath8 exists in a finite momentum interval @xmath59 $ ] . upon decreasing the temperature",
    "the long - lived branch of the pair spectrum gradually splits off from the incoherent background ( upper panel in fig .",
    "3 ) and spreads over a wider and wider momentum region , with @xmath3 steadily decreasing as we approach @xmath7 . we note however that invariably the linear in @xmath5 dispersion changes into a damped free particle like behavior in the close vicinity of @xmath6 .",
    "the sound - wave mode has been so far measured above @xmath7 in the liquid helium by ultrasonic techniques @xcite as well as by neutron scattering measurements @xcite . in the case of the trapped fermionic atoms",
    "the corresponding mode is expected to be compressional density waves and , similar to the present study , one should expect remnants of those modes in the normal state . in principle ,",
    "such modes can be experimentally checked by the bragg spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "indirect methods for detecting the collective modes which rely on measuring the magnetic susceptibility and density - density correlation functions have been discussed ( although only for @xmath4 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . in some future work",
    "we shall discuss how collective modes can possibly be observed in measurements of the magnetic susceptibility in the pseudogap regime above @xmath8",
