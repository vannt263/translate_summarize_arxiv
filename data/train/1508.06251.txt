    "the recent detection of pulsed emission from the crab and vela pulsars at energies above 50 gev by ground - based air - cherenkov telescopes marks a turning point both in technological achievement of the detectors and in pulsar acceleration and radiation modeling .",
    "the magic telescope first detected pulsed emission from the crab above 25 gev ( aliu et al .",
    "2008 ) , followed by pulsed detections above 100 gev by veritas ( aliu et al . 2011 ) and up to 400 gev with magic ( aleksic et al .",
    "the averaged and phase - resolved spectra above 25 gev are consistent with a smooth broken power - law extension of the spectrum measured by the _",
    "fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) above 100 mev , thus ruling out an exponentially cutoff power - law spectrum predicted by curvature radiation ( cr ) models for gev emission ( e.g. romani 1996 , harding et al .",
    "2008 [ hsdf08 ] ) . very recently ,",
    "pulsed emission was detected from the vela pulsar above 30 gev with the hess ( stegmann et al .",
    "2014 ) telescope and above 50 gev with the _ fermi_-lat ( leung et al .",
    "2014 ) . in this case",
    "it is not clear whether another emission component in addition to cr is required .",
    "most recently , veritas has reported a non - detection of the geminga pulsar above 100 gev ( aliu et al .",
    "mccann ( 2015 ) performed a stacking analysis of 115 _ fermi _ pulsars from the _ fermi_-lat 2nd pulsar catalog ( abdo et al . 2013 ) , both young and msps , and found no significant emission at more than 7% crab level above 50 gev .",
    "for many years , cr was the favored mechanism for the high energy ( @xmath4 mev ) pulsed emission in a number of different models for pulsar emission , and vhe emission similar to what has been detected from the crab was never predicted . in models where acceleration and emission occur above the pulsar polar caps ( pc models , daugherty & harding 1996 ) , the predicted spectrum of cr from primary electrons has a very sharp  super - exponential \" cutoff due to attenuation by the magnetic pair production process that occurs in the very strong magnetic fields near the neutron star surface .",
    "measurement of the spectral cutoff of the vela pulsar by _ fermi _ ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) has shown that a super - exponential cutoff can be eliminated with high significance , ruling out emission from near the neutron star pcs .",
    "models for emission originating in the outer magnetosphere are therefore favored , since many of these predict curvature radiation spectra from primary particles with exponential spectral cutoffs at energies of a few gev that agree well with those measured for most pulsars by _",
    "fermi_. such models include the outer gap ( og ) , where acceleration and emission occur in vacuum gaps that form above the null charge surface ( e.g. romani 1966 , cheng et al .",
    "2000 , hirotani 2006 ) and the slot gap ( sg ) , where acceleration and emission occur in a narrow region along the last open field lines from the neutron star surface to near the light cylinder ( muslimov & harding 2004 [ mh04 ] , hsdf08 ) .",
    "more recently , models postulating high - energy emission originating outside the light cylinder , near or in the current sheet that forms in the spin equatorial plane have been developed .",
    "several of these models assume that synchrotron radiation ( sr ) from particles accelerated by magnetic reconnection in the current sheet produces the gev emission ( e.g. ptri 2012 , uzdensky & spitkovsky 2014 ) , while others assume that cr by particles accelerated by induced electric fields in dissipative magnetospheres produces the gev emission ( kalapotharakos et al .",
    "2014 , brambilla et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat has to date detected more than 160 @xmath5-ray pulsars and all of these with statistics adequate for spectral fitting of a power law with exponential cutoff dn(e)/de = e^- , show cutoffs , @xmath6 , in the range 1 - 7 gev ( abdo et al .",
    "2013 ) , assuming @xmath7 .",
    "for a subset of pulsars having higher counts , fits to the above expression with @xmath8 free can be performed and a number of these are best fit with @xmath9 , including the crab and vela pulsars , indicating a more gradual cutoff than pure exponential .",
    "this finding raises the question of whether the more gradual high - energy cutoffs are due to a blending of cr spectra from a number of different rotation phases ( abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) and/or locations in the magnetosphere ( leung et al 2014 ) , or additional emission components .",
    "it has been suggested that the very - high - energy ( vhe ) emission from the crab is inverse - compton emission ( lyutikov et al .",
    "2012 ) , since it is difficult to produce photons above 100 gev with cr .",
    "lyutikov ( 2013 ) modeled the crab x - ray and @xmath5-ray spectra as cyclotron - self compton emission from electron - positron pairs in the outer magnetosphere , fitting the data to determine the spectrum and multiplicity of the pair spectrum as well as the location of emission .",
    "an synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) model for the crab vhe emission from the outer gap ( og ) was suggested by aleksic et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and du et al .",
    "( 2012 ) modeled the observed crab emission from the annular gap .",
    "alternatively , it was proposed that particles accelerated by reconnection in the current sheet reach temperatures of 10 gev , if equipartition is assumed , and their sr can extend to 100 gev in the observer frame after doppler boosting ( uzdensky & spitkosky 2014 , iwona & petri 2015 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we apply a pair cascade simulation coupled to an outer magnetosphere radiation model to predict the broadband x - ray to vhe @xmath5-ray spectra of several classes of pulsar . in this model ,",
    "the pairs are produced in cascades above the pcs initiated by primary accelerated electrons and sustained by magnetic pair creation ( e.g. daugherty & harding 1982 ) .",
    "the pairs lose their momentum perpendicular to the magnetic field to sr near the pcs and then stream into the outer magnetosphere , where they absorb radio photons in the cyclotron resonance to regain pitch angles and emit sr ( hsdf08 ) .",
    "the sr provides soft photons for inverse - compton scattering by these same particles to boost their energies to the @xmath5-ray range .",
    "we also include cr radiation of primaries accelerated by electric fields in a sg geometry , as well as their sr components due to cyclotron resonant absorption .",
    "the radio emission is simulated using an empirical cone and core beam model .",
    "since the magnetic field structure in the outer magnetosphere becomes important for these models , we use a force - free magnetosphere configuration to define the magnetic field , a significant improvement over the retarded vacuum dipole field that we had used previously ( hsdf08 ) .",
    "use of the force - free magnetic field structure allows us to follow particles and radiation arbitrarily close to and even beyond the light cylinder , which should not be a physical limitation of emission models .",
    "although force - free magnetospheres assume that the electric field parallel to the magnetic field , @xmath10 , vanishes , they well approximate the field structure of energetic pulsars where departures from force - free conditions exist only in narrow accelerator gaps .",
    "we therefore use the force - free field structure but assume acceleration of primary particles in a narrow sg . using these simulations , we can address the question of how many pulsars should have detectable ssc emission and how high in energy this emission extends .",
    "since radiation of relativistic particles is beamed along their direction of momentum , and particle trajectories in pulsar magnetospheres follow closely ( but not exactly ) the magnetic field lines , the structure of the magnetic field is a critical component to emission models .",
    "a static dipole is not a good approximation to a pulsar magnetic field , even near the neutron star , since the rotation causes a sweepback of the field lines near and beyond the light cylinder .",
    "the vacuum retarded dipole solution ( deutsch 1955 ) , adopted in many radiation models ( e.g. romani & yadigaroglu 1995 , cheng et al .",
    "2000 , hsdf08 ) , incorporates the sweepback due to retardation of the field and produces a distortion and shift of the open field volume ( including the pc ) toward its trailing edge ( dyks & harding 2004 ) .",
    "numerical solutions of force - free magnetospheres ( spitkovsky 2006 , timokhin 2006 ) , where the plasma density is assumed to be high enough to screen @xmath10 so that the ideal mhd condition @xmath11 is enforced , show a larger degree of magnetic field sweepback , as well as straightening of the poloidal field lines due to currents .",
    "recent simulations of dissipative pulsar magnetospheres ( kalapotharakos et al . 2012 , li et al . 2012 ) , that drop the ideal mhd condition and allow finite @xmath10 , show that the structure of the magnetic field stays close to force - free for the high plasma conductivity needed to match the @xmath5-ray light curves ( kalapotharakos et al .",
    "2014 , hereafter khk14 ) and spectra ( brambilla et al .",
    "2015 ) of young pulsars",
    ".    we will therefore adopt the force - free magnetosphere structure to model the particle trajectories and radiation , and all calculations are done in the non - rotating , inertial observer s frame ( iof ) .",
    "the pairs are assumed to be produced at the pcs and to screen the @xmath10 at higher altitudes , except for a narrow gap along the last open field lines ( the sg ) .",
    "they will therefore not experience any acceleration in the calculation of their radiation in the global magnetosphere .",
    "the primary electrons are assumed to be accelerated only in the sg , with a constant @xmath10 that we take as a free parameter .",
    "both pairs and primary electrons are injected at the neutron star surface at footprints of open field lines that are determined by ",
    "open volume coordinates \" ( dyks et al .",
    "2004 [ dhr04 ] ) .",
    "these coordinates map the open field region bounded by field lines that close within the light cylinder , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the pulsar angular rotation frequency .",
    "the magnetic field vector is determined at each point by 3d interpolation of a table of values read - in from a numerical force - free magnetosphere solution ( kalapotharakos et al .",
    "this solution has a resolution of @xmath14 and extends to a minimum radius of @xmath15 , which is the surface of a pulsar with period @xmath16 ms . to extend this solution to the surface of pulsars with longer periods , we join the numerical solution to a retarded vacuum dipole solution over the range @xmath17 using a ramp function .",
    "the code first computes the pc rim at the neutron star surface by performing 4th order runge - kutta integrations along the field lines of the numerical solution to determine the open field footpoints .",
    "this is done by iteration , choosing an initial value of magnetic polar angle @xmath18 at a number of different values of magnetic azimuth @xmath19 .",
    "if the field line with that footpoint does / does not close within @xmath20 , a smaller / larger value of @xmath21 is chosen until the closure point is at @xmath20 within a given tolerance .",
    "we define  open volume coordinates \" @xmath22 to identify footpoints at the neutron star surface of field lines along which the particles are traced .",
    "the  radial \" coordinate @xmath23 , equivalent to magnetic polar angle , is equal to 0 at the magnetic pole and 1 at the pc rim .",
    "lines of constant @xmath23 define a set of concentric deformed rings that fill the pc surface ( see figure 2 of dhr04 ) .",
    "the  azimuthal \" coordinate @xmath24 measures the arclength along each distorted ring with fixed @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 increase in the direction of magnetic azimuth , @xmath25 , in a counterclockwise direction around the pc , starting from @xmath26 at @xmath27 , defined to be at the magnetic meridian ( i.e. the line between the magnetic and spin axes ) . with this definition",
    ", @xmath28 is on the leading side of the pc and @xmath29 is on the trailing side ( note that @xmath30 ) .    to model an injection of particles that is uniform over the pc , we use a set of rings between @xmath31 and @xmath32 with equal spacing @xmath33 .",
    "these footpoints are then spaced uniformly in each of the rings with @xmath34 equal divisions .",
    "since each ring has the same number of footpoints , and the rings have varying circumferences , the contribution from different rings must be weighted by @xmath35,where @xmath36 is the length of a particular ring and @xmath37 is the total pc rim length . to determine the trajectories of particles in the iof , we require the total particle velocity to be the sum of a drift component and a component parallel to the magnetic field ( khk14 ) , [ velocityv ] = ( + f ) c  , where ( gruzinov 2008 , li et al .",
    "2012 ) , @xmath38 by requiring that @xmath39 and that the motion is outward , we can solve for the scalar quantity @xmath40 at each point along the trajectory .",
    "in the special case of a force - free magnetosphere , @xmath41 stays parallel to @xmath42 in the corotating frame . in the iof , the step size along the particle trajectory is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the step size along the rotating magnetic field line ( see appendix c of bai & spitkovsky 2010 ) . in treating the particle trajectories in the iof with force - free field geometry , it is possible to extend the trajectories and radiation outside the light cylinder .",
    "although the particles are following the field , they slide forward along the field lines as the field lines sweep back , following a nearly radial path in the iof at @xmath45 .",
    "the process of electron - positron pair production in pulsar magnetospheres is thought to be critical for generating charges for the magnetosphere and for the pulsar wind nebula , as well as plasma necessary for coherent radio emission .",
    "the pairs are produced in electromagnetic cascades above the pcs ( daugherty & harding 1982 ) or in ogs ( cheng et al .",
    "1986 ) . here",
    ", we assume that the pairs that radiate sr and ssc in the outer magnetosphere originate from pc cascades , that are initiated in the strong electric fields near the neutron star surface by acceleration primary electrons .",
    "we have calculated the spectra of pairs using a code that simulates a steady ( non - time - dependent ) electromagnetic cascade above the pulsar pc ( harding & muslimov 2011 [ hm11 ] ) .",
    "primary particles are accelerated by an electric field induced by rotation of the magnetic field , derived assuming space - charge - limited flow ( i.e. , free emission of particles from the neutron star surface ) ( arons & scharlemann 1979 ) , and emit curvature radiation .",
    "the highest energy curvature photons are absorbed by magnetic pair attenuation ( erber 1966 , daugherty & harding 1983 ) , producing a spectrum of first - generation electron - positron pairs .",
    "the pairs are born in excited landau states ( with non - zero pitch angles ) and radiate synchrotron photons that spawn further generations of pairs . since the total cascade multiplicity @xmath2 ( average number of pairs produced by each primary particle ) depends on the pulsar period @xmath46 and surface magnetic field strength @xmath47 , younger pulsars produce high @xmath2 cascades but older pulsars , with low magnetic fields and long periods , have much lower @xmath2 .",
    "this results in a pair death line in @xmath46-@xmath48 which , in the case of a dipole field , predicts that the older half of the pulsar population can not produce significant pair multiplicity .",
    "however , the sweepback of magnetic field lines near the light cylinder ( due to real and displacement currents ) , as well as possible field distortions near the neutron star will cause the magnetic pcs to be offset from the dipole axis ( e.g. dyks & harding 2004 ) . hm11 introduced a perturbed dipole field structure with non - axisymmetry and showed that the resulting offset pc enhances pair multiplicity by increasing the accelerating electric field . for the pair cascade simulations , we will adopt this magnetic field structure which has two configurations for the dipole offset in which the magnetic field is symmetric or asymmetric with respect to the dipole axis .",
    "modeling of the thermal x - ray light curves of several msps requires an offset of the pc hotspot that is symmetric ( bogdanov et al 2013 ) .",
    "we adopt the symmetric distorted field in simulating the pair spectra of the msps in this paper . in this case , the magnetic field in spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) is @xmath52 , \\label{b1}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is a dimensionless radial coordinate in units of the stellar radius @xmath54 , @xmath47 is the surface field strength at the magnetic pole , @xmath55 is a parameter defining the azimuthal distortion of the polar field lines from a dipole , and @xmath56 is the magnetic azimuthal angle that defines the plane of the pc offset . hm11",
    "derive the parallel component of the electric field , @xmath10 , using this field structure and we have used the @xmath10 of eqn ( 11 ) of hm11 that corresponds to a symmetric offset .",
    "we use this @xmath10 to accelerate the electrons from different starting points over the pc surface and simulate the pair cascades over the whole pcfor a range of @xmath46 , @xmath57 ( or equivalently , @xmath47 ) , and offset parameter @xmath58 .",
    "we assume a non - zero offset only for the msps .",
    "pair spectra for the parameters of the crab ( @xmath59 ) , vela ( @xmath59 ) and msps psr b1821 - 24 ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) psr b1937 + 21 ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) are shown in figure [ fig : pairspec ] .",
    "the crab pair spectrum extends over five decades of pair energy , from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , while the vela pair spectrum has a smaller range , cutting off around @xmath64 .",
    "the difference is due to the shorter period and larger pc size of the crab , which gives smaller radii of curvature of the field lines , so that cr photons have higher energy and gain large angles to the field , and the higher magnetic field strength .",
    "the pair spectra of the msps start at energies about two decade higher , @xmath65 and extend to higher energy , @xmath66 .",
    "this striking difference in pair spectra of young and msps comes from their large difference ( four orders of magnitude ) in surface field strengths .",
    "as described by hm11 , the photons must have higher energies to produce pairs in lower magnetic fields , which raises the minimum pair energy , but are also able to escape at higher energies , raising the high energy cutoff in the pair spectrum .",
    "the non - zero pc offset decreases the lower cutoff of the pair spectrum relative to the pair spectrum with zero offset by a fraction of a decade .",
    "simulations of pc cascades including time dependence of the electromagnetic fields and plasma production ( timokhin 2010 , timokhin & arons 2013 ) find that to satisfy the charge and current density of the global magnetosphere models the pair cascades are non - steady .",
    "the accelerating electric field is time - dependent , in the general case where the magnetospheric current density @xmath67 is not very close to the goldreich - julian value , @xmath68 , with cycles of pair creation followed by complete screening of the electric field .",
    "the timescale of these pair cascade cycles is very short ( of order the light crossing time across the gap ) .",
    "such non - steady pair cascades can produce pair multiplicities that are much higher than the steady cascades . for young pulsars such as the crab and vela ,",
    "the time - averaged pair multiplicities are about several times @xmath3 ( timokhin & harding 2015 ) , compared to @xmath69 for the crab and @xmath70 for vela steady pair cascades .",
    "time - dependent pair cascade results are not yet available for msps , where 2d simulations are required .",
    "although it is beyond the scope of this paper to simulate time - dependent pair spectra ( especially for millisecond pulsars [ msps ] ) , we will allow for pair multiplicities higher than that of steady cascades in our ssc simulations .",
    "we model the high - energy radiation over the entire spectrum from optical to vhe @xmath5-ray wavelengths .",
    "emission from both primary particles and pairs are simulated as they move along their trajectories with step size @xmath71 , starting at the neutron star surface to a maximum radius @xmath72 .",
    "primary electrons are assumed to undergo continuous acceleration with a constant electric field , @xmath73 in a narrow gap along the boundary of the open field region , between @xmath74 .",
    "the electric field in the high - altitude gap is not the same field from hm11 that is used for the pair cascades , since the hm11 field is only valid for low altitudes near the pc .",
    "the high - altitude gap forms at the outer edge of the pc , where the interior @xmath10 decreases to values too low for pair cascades to develop .",
    "although analytic solutions exist for both the low altitude sg ( muslimov & harding 2003 ) and its extension to high altitudes ( mh04 ) , we have chosen not the use the solution of mh04 for several reasons . first , the gamma - ray luminosity modeled using the sg @xmath10 solution of mh04 with widths narrow enough to produce the observed light curves falls short of the observed luminosities by about a factor of 10 for young pulsars . as noted by pierbattista et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , the @xmath10 solution for the original sg and also the og do not provide enough gamma - ray luminosity to match the observed _ fermi _ pulsars . the @xmath10 of hm2011 on the offset side of the pc is larger and may produce a large enough @xmath10 at high altitude to produce luminosities matching the data .",
    "however , it is very difficult to derive the @xmath10 extension for the offset pcs and this has not yet been done .",
    "also , with the advent of dissipative magnetosphere models we will soon be able to have more self - consistent @xmath10 throughout the magnetosphere , albeit numerical .",
    "until these are available , we decided it is better to treat @xmath10 at high altitudes as a free parameter .",
    "we have therefore simply assumed a constant @xmath10 for the high - altitude gap , similar to the behavior of the high - altitude symmetric sg mh04 .",
    "the electron - positron pairs are assumed to experience no acceleration as they flow along their trajectories in the screened region inside the gap , between @xmath75 .",
    "cr , sr and ssc radiation are simulated for all particles in the same way , as described below .",
    "the primary electrons are injected at the neutron star surface with very low lorentz factors , @xmath76 , while the pairs are injected with the pair cascade spectra shown in figure [ fig : pairspec ] .",
    "all particles are assumed to initially have momentum only parallel to the magnetic field , since the pairs lose all their perpendicular momentum to sr very near the neutron star surface in the pair cascade .",
    "single primary electrons are injected at the start of each primary trajectory at the neutron star surface and their radiation is normalized to the primary flux [ eq : np ] n_p = n_gj c r^2_pc^2[(r_ovc^max)^2 - ( r_ovc^min)^2 ] where @xmath77 is the goldreich - julian density and @xmath78 is the pc half - angle .",
    "the primary particles from the interior of the pc are on field lines that do not thread the high - altitude accelerator gap , but are on field lines where the accelerating field is screened above a pair formation front by pair cascades at low altitude .",
    "since these primaries are not accelerated above the pair front , they lose most of their energy quickly and do not contribute much to emission at high altitudes . the emission from the pc pair cascades is all emitted at low altitudes , below 6 - 7 stellar radii , and",
    "will only be visible when an observer viewing angle is very close to the magnetic axis .",
    "since most observer angles will not see the pc emission , we therefore can neglect their contribution in the present study .    to simulate radiation from a spectrum of pair energies , shown in figure [ fig : pairspec ] ,",
    "the pair spectrum is divided into logarithmic energy intervals , @xmath79 , between @xmath80 and @xmath81 and a single pair member ( electron or positron ) at each energy , @xmath82 , is injected at the base of each pair trajectory .",

    "this index is much higher than the soft x - ray index of the pair sr spectrum of the crab , where the soft x - ray emission is near the sed peak and produced by a range of pair energies .",
    "however , the predicted ssc fluxes of the msps are too low to be detectable with current instruments .",
    "thus from our simulations , only crab and crab - like pulsars , such as b1509 - 58 and b0540 - 69 in the lmc , are expected to have high enough levels of ssc emission at vhe energies to possibly be detectable by ground - based air - cherenkov telescopes .",
    "they share the characteristics that are important for production of strong ssc emission : high levels of non - thermal x rays , high pair multiplicity and high magnetic fields near the light cylinder .",
    "non - crab - like , middle - aged pulsars like vela have much lower levels of non - thermal x rays relative to their gev emission .",
    "so even if they are able to generate very high pair multiplicities @xmath240 , their pair energies will be too low and their ssc emission will not reach detectable levels at vhe energy .",
    "msps have higher levels of ssc than middle - aged pulsars , and their ssc spectra extend to higher energies than crab - like pulsars , since their pair spectra reach tev energies .",
    "however , their pair multiplicities may not be high enough to generate fluxes of ssc emission that are detectable by current telescopes .",
    "these findings are consistent with the recent stacking analysis of mccann ( 2015 ) .",
    "lyutikov ( 2013 ) presented a model for the crab pulsar emission , assuming cyclotron and cyclotron - self compton emission by pairs produced in the og and gyrating at the cyclotron resonance with small pitch angles .",
    "it was suggested that the pairs acquire their pitch angles through coherent emission of radio waves , but their perpendicular momenta are assumed to remain non - relativistic so that the radiation occurs in the cyclotron rather than the synchrotron regime .",
    "the required pair multiplicity is @xmath241 , well above what can be produced in either pc or og pair cascades . in our model ,",
    "the pairs gain pitch angles through resonant absorption and acquire relativistic perpendicular momenta , so that the radiation is in the synchrotron regime . since the synchrotron radiation power is much higher than cyclotron power , we can produce the crab optical to x - ray emission with a much lower pair multiplicity of @xmath242 .",
    "we would like to thank isabelle grenier , andrey timokhin and christo venter for helpful discussions and acknowledge support from the nasa astrophysics theory program and the @xmath243 guest investigator program .",
    "resources supporting this work were provided by the nasa high - end computing ( hec ) program through the nasa center for climate simulation ( nccs ) at goddard space flight center .",
    "we thank craig pelissier of the nccs in particular for help with parallel processing .",
