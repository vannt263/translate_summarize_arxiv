    "entanglement is a basic feature of composite quantum systems connected to the tensor product structure of the underlying hilbert space of states .",
    "a mixed state of a bipartite quantum system described by some density matrix @xmath11 is said to be entangled or inseparable if @xmath11 can not be written as a convex linear combination of product states .",
    "otherwise it is called classically correlated or separable @xcite .",
    "the properties of entangled states are responsible for many of the fascinating and curious aspects of the quantum world and lie at the core of many proposed applications in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the general characterization and quantification of entanglement in mixed quantum states is a highly non - trivial problem .",
    "it is even very difficult in general to formulate simple operational criteria which allow a unique identification of all separable states of a given composite system .",
    "there do exist , however , many necessary separability criteria @xcite . a simple and ,",
    "in fact , very strong criterion is the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite which states that a necessary condition for a given density matrix @xmath11 to be separable is that it has a positive partial transposition ( ppt states ) .",
    "it is known that this criterion is necessary and sufficient for certain low - dimensional systems , while it is only necessary in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the entanglement structure is greatly facilitated through the introduction of symmetries , i.  e. , if one restricts to those states of the composite system which are invariant under certain groups of symmetry transformations .",
    "important examples in this context are the manifolds of the werner states @xcite , of the isotropic states @xcite and of the orthogonal states @xcite . here , we investigate entanglement under the symmetry group @xmath0 of proper three - dimensional rotations of the coordinate axes .",
    "more precisely , we consider the problem of mixed state entanglement of systems which are composed of two particles with spins @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and which are invariant under product representations of the group @xmath0 or , equivalently , of the covering group @xmath12 .",
    "a basic tool of our analysis is the work of vollbrecht and werner @xcite which provides a general scheme for the treatment of entanglement under given symmetry groups .",
    "mixed @xmath0-invariant states of composite systems arise , for example , from the interaction of open systems @xcite with isotropic environments @xcite .",
    "their analysis is of great importance and leads to many applications . as examples we mention investigations on the connection between quantum phase transitions and the behaviour of entanglement measures ( see , e.  g. , @xcite ) , the analysis of entanglement of @xmath12-invariant multiphoton states generated by parametric down - conversion @xcite , and studies of the entanglement of formation @xcite .",
    "the technique of this paper could also be relevant for the characterization of quantum correlations in fermionic or bosonic systems developed recently @xcite .",
    "the hilbert space of a system which is composed of two particles with spins @xmath1 and @xmath2 is given by the tensor product @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the dimensions of the local spin spaces .",
    "we call such a system an @xmath16 system . throughout the paper we will assume that @xmath17 , i.  e. , @xmath18 .",
    "according to the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite the cases of @xmath19 and @xmath20 systems are trivial : it is known that in these cases the ppt criterion is necessary and sufficient for all states , i.  e. , even for states which are not invariant under rotations .",
    "schliemann @xcite has shown recently that the ppt criterion is also necessary and sufficient for @xmath0-invariant @xmath21 systems with arbitrary @xmath22 .",
    "the case of @xmath23 systems has been treated by vollbrecht and werner @xcite , who proved that the ppt criterion is again necessary and sufficient for separability . for @xmath24 systems",
    "a qualitatively new situation arises : it has been demonstrated in @xcite that the ppt criterion is not sufficient and that the entangled ppt states form a three - dimensional manifold which is isomorphic to a prism . in the present work",
    "we investigate the important special case of @xmath25 systems with arbitrary @xmath22 .",
    "the method developed in @xcite enables the treatment of the case of equal spins @xmath26 . in this paper",
    "we extend this method to arbitrary spins @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for the analysis of entanglement under @xmath0-symmetry it is advantageous to replace the transposition used in the ppt criterion by another unitarily equivalent operation , namely by the antiunitary transformation of the time reversal .",
    "the reason for this fact is that the operation of the time reversal of states commutes with the representations of the rotation group .",
    "there are two natural representations of rotationally invariant states .",
    "the first one uses the fact that any invariant state can be written as a unique convex linear combination of the projections @xmath3 onto the eigenspaces of the total angular momentum @xmath4 of the composite spin system .",
    "the advantage of this representation is that it leads to very simple conditions expressing the positivity and the normalization of physical states .",
    "however , the set of the ppt states is most easily determined in another representation which employs the irreducible spherical tensor operators of spin-@xmath8 particles . we will construct a complete system of invariant operators @xmath5 which are built out of the spherical tensors of rank @xmath6 . any invariant state of the composite spin system",
    "can then be written as a unique linear combination of the @xmath5 .",
    "the introduction of the invariant operators @xmath5 generalizes the ideas of schliemann @xcite , who has developed a representation of @xmath12-invariant states by means of spin - spin correlators and has formulated various separability conditions and sum rules in terms of these correlators .",

    "[ 3tensorn ] to the case of @xmath27 systems with arbitrary @xmath22 .",
    "we prove that the ppt criterion represents a necessary and sufficient separability condition for @xmath27 systems if and only if @xmath22 is odd .",
    "thus , for integer spins @xmath2 all ppt states are separable , while for half - integer spins @xmath2 there always exist entangled ppt states .",
    "this fact has already been conjectured by hendriks @xcite on the basis of a detailed numerical investigation .",
    "we also show that for half - integer @xmath2 the boundary of the separability region is curved .",

    "in particular , we construct an optimal entanglement witness for the case of half - integer spins and exploit this witness to design a protocol which allows the detection of entangled ppt states through measurements of the total angular momentum .",

    "the irreducible unitary representation of the group @xmath0 of proper rotations @xmath44 on the state space of a particle with spin @xmath8 will be denoted by @xmath45 .",
