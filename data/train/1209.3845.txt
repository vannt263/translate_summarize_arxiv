    "twenty five years ago , nickerson and manning examined how an elastic curve minimizes its energy when its freedom to bend in space is constrained by a two - dimensional obstacle @xcite .",
    "their motivation was to understand the wrapping of dna , a semi - flexible polymer , around histone cylinders but the question is also relevant to an understanding of the confinement of dna within viral capsids ( see , for example , @xcite ) . whereas a space curve minimizes the euclidean distance between two points by negotiating obstacles along surface geodesics , an elastic curve generally will not .",
    "this is because the relevant energy is not arc - length but the bending energy of the curve in three - dimensional space , quadratic in the spatial frenet curvature @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this energy is always greater than its surface counterpart , quadratic in the geodesic curvature @xmath3 , characterising how the curve bends within the surface . by projecting the curvature vector of the space curve along the surface and normal to it",
    ", its bending energy can be decomposed as a sum of two contributions : @xmath4 @xcite ; whereas the intrinsic @xmath3 is insensitive to the three - dimensional environment , the normal curvature @xmath5 will register how the surface itself bends in space . when the surface is a sphere , @xmath5 is a constant and thus the spatial bending energy will be minimized by surface geodesics .",
    "the snag , however , is that the boundary conditions , and in particular the closure of the curve , tend to be incompatible with geodesic behavior . in @xcite",
    "the equilibrium states of a closed elastic loop confined within a sphere were examined .",
    "it was found that , if the loop is short , there is a unique ground state ; it is completely attached and it exhibits a two - fold dihedral symmetry , shown in fig .",
    "this state is stable ; all of its excited counterparts are unstable .",
    "the bending energy was also found to depend  in a surprisingly sensitive way  on the length of the loop . contradicting naive expectations , neither the energy nor the forces transmitted to the sphere increase monotonically with loop length .",
    "local maxima are associated with the incommensurability of loop length with the equatorial circumference .        in this paper , higher dimensional analogues of a confined elastic loop will be examined . in particular",
    ", the focus will be on confined two - dimensional surfaces .",
    "the surface energy is now the two - dimensional bending energy , quadratic in its curvature ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in the absence of constraints , it is simple to demonstrate that the closed surface minimizing this energy will be a round sphere .",
    "the obvious higher - dimensional analogue of a confined loop is a two - dimensional closed surface confined within a sphere of smaller area .",
    "this is a problem of considerable interest from a biological perspective  where the morphology of cellular compartments may involves the confinement of one membrane within another  and it has been explored recently by kahraman et al .",
    "@xcite . in distinction to the loop , which attaches everywhere to the sphere , the confined surface must detach somewhere , folding into the cavity .",
    "the interesting behavior occurs within these interior folds and along the boundaries of the regions of contact , not within the regions of contact themselves . a more appropriate analogue of the confined loop is provided by locating the surface in a higher dimensional environment .",
    "the simplest possibility is to embed the two - dimensional surface in a four - dimensional euclidean geometry , confining it within a three - dimensional hypersurface , and , in particular , a hypersphere of smaller radius . while this may appear a somewhat recondite exercise from the practical  application - driven ",
    "point of view of condensed matter , geometrically it is the natural generalization of the confined loop .",
    "mathematically , it also can be viewed as a natural generalization of the willmore problem involving competing length scales@xcite . indeed , when the constraint on the area is relaxed , it reduces to the willmore problem as formulated on a three - sphere , @xmath6 .",
    "to address this problem , the constraint is imposed by introducing a local lagrange multiplier .",
    "this generalizes the variational framework developed in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the multiplier quantifies directly the loss of euclidean invariance associated with the constraint ; it becomes a source for the stress induced in the surface , its value at any point identified with the local normal force associated with the constraint .",
    "if a surface of area greater than @xmath7 is confined within a unit hypersphere it will generally buckle into a non - spherical shape . unlike its loop counterpart , however , this problem is not tractable analytically . in this paper , it will be treated perturbatively in the regime where the surface area is marginally greater than @xmath7 . in analogy to a circular loop confined within a sphere",
    ", it is found that the confined equilibrium shapes are quantized .",
    "these states are represented by spherical harmonic deformations of a two - sphere .",
    "the ground state is a quadrupole , exhibiting a three - fold degeneracy ; all higher multipoles turn out to be unstable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ confinedelastica ] , the variational framework is introduced .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for the surface are derived and the constraining force identified . whereas the local confining force typically is not constant , it will be if the confinement is within a hypersphere . in section [ spherical ] the weak confinement of a two dimensional sphere by a spherical hypersurface",
    "is examined .",
