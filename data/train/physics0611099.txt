    "a permanent magnet is an ensemble of microscopic magnetic moments which are oriented along the magnetization direction .",
    "a magnetic moment can be modeled as a dipole , i.e. , as a slightly displaced pair of magnetic monopoles with opposite polarities .",
    "it is analogous to the electric dipole .",
    "another way of modeling is to consider each magnetic moment as a circulating current loop . in terms of far fields , the dipole model and the loop - current model",
    "give exactly the same magnetic field .",
    "the latter model is more natural because there are no magnetic monopoles found so far and microscopic magnetic moments are always associated with kinetic rotations such as orbital motions or spins of electrons .",
    "it also provides correct symmetries with respect to the time and space inversions .",
    "normally we are interested in macroscopic quantities , which are obtained by coarse - graining of microscopic fields and source distributions @xcite . when we coarse - grain the oriented ensemble of microscopic magnetic dipoles in a bar magnet , we have a magnetic north pole at one end and a south pole at the other end as shown in fig .",
    "contributions of the magnetic charges inside are canceled out through the spatial average .    on the other hand , when we coarse - grain the microscopic loop currents , we have macroscopic current which circulates around the bar along the surface as shown in fig .",
    "by mimicking the macroscopic current distribution by a coil , we have an electromagnet that is equivalent to the permanent magnet . in this model ,",
    "the poles , or the ends of bar magnet play no special roles . again",
    "the current model is much more reasonable because of the similarity with the equivalent electromagnet .",
    "[ c][c]magnetic dipole [ c][c]current loop     the use of the notion of magnetic pole should be avoided as far as possible @xcite because of its absence in the framework of electromagnetic theory or in the maxwell equations . practically , however , magnetic poles are very convenient to describe the forces between permanent magnets or magnetized objects .",
    "the poles are considered as an ensemble of monopoles and the forces between poles are calculated with the magnetic coulomb law , which is usually introduced just as an analog of the electric coulomb law or as an empirical rule @xcite . for logical consistency , we have to _ derive _ the magnetic coulomb law from maxwell s equations and the lorentz force , none of which contain the notion of magnetic monopoles .    the derivation of magnetic coulomb s law was given more than forty years ago by chen@xcite and nadeau@xcite . in this paper a more detailed analysis based directly on the fundamental laws will be provided .",
    "the field singularity for infinitesimal loop currents , which plays crucial roles but was not mentioned in the previous works , will be treated rigorously .",
    "for brevity , we introduce a scalar function @xmath0 and a vector function @xmath1 of position @xmath2 : @xmath3 we note that @xmath4 and @xmath5 hold , where @xmath6 is the three dimensional delta function . with these ,",
    "the scalar potential for a point charge @xmath7 placed at the origin is @xmath8 , and the force acting on a charge @xmath9 at @xmath10 from another charge @xmath11 at @xmath12 is @xmath13 .",
    "the biot - savard law can be expressed as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a current moment ( current @xmath16 times length @xmath17 ) located at the origin .    as shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "a thin solenoid can be constructed as a stack of tiny loop currents at least in principle @xcite .",
    "the current density for an infinitesimal loop current place at the origin is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the magnetic moment for the loop current and its unit is @xmath20 ( see appendix ) . to form a solenoid we stack these tiny loop currents along a curve @xmath21 with a constant line density @xmath22 ( loops per unit length ) .",
    "each loop are aligned so that the direction of tangent of curve and that of @xmath19 coincide .",
    "the current density distribution for a line segment @xmath23 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the magnetic moment per unit length and characterizes the strength of the solenoid @xcite , where @xmath26 is the magnitude of @xmath19 and @xmath27 represents the position of the segment @xmath28 .",
    "here we introduce an important formula . for a constant vector @xmath29 and a vector field @xmath30 , we have @xmath31    with the biot - savard law and eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) , we can find the strength of magnetic field generated by a magnetic moment @xmath19 placed at the origin as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a volume element at @xmath34 and @xmath35 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq35 ] ) , it can be rewritten as @xmath36 where the relations @xmath37 and @xmath38 have been used . as shown in appendix , eq .",
    "( [ eq40 ] ) can also be derived from the maxwell equations .",
    "it is well known that the field for an electric dipole moment @xmath39 is @xmath40 , which contains no delta - function terms unlike eq .",
    "( [ eq40 ] ) .",
    "this means that in terms of near fields , the dipole and the current loop do not yield the same field .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq40 ] ) , the strength of the magnetic field created by a line segment @xmath28 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",

    "the second term of the right - hand side , which corresponds to the magnetic flux confined in the solenoid , vanishes outside . for semi - infinite cases ( @xmath44 ) ,",
    "we have @xmath45 the first term of the right - hand side , which represents the magnetic field outside of the solenoid , is equivalent to the field for a monopole @xmath46 located at @xmath10 : @xmath47 the dimension of @xmath48 , @xmath49 correctly corresponds to that for the magnetic charge .",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath48 confined along the solenoid fans out isotropically from the end point @xmath10 . as seen in fig .  2 , a thin",
    ", semi - infinite solenoid can be viewed as a magnetic monopole located at the end .",
    "from eq .  ( [ eq20 ] ) , we see that the lorentz force acting on a tiny loop current @xmath19 placed at @xmath50 in a magnetic field @xmath51 is @xmath52 using eq .",
    "( [ eq35 ] ) and the conditions for magnetic field : @xmath53 ( divergence - free ) and @xmath54 ( rotation - free ) , the expression can be modified as @xmath55 which is suitable for line - integral .",
    "equation ( [ eq106 ] ) can also be modified as @xmath56 with the divergence - free condition only .",
    "the rotation - free condition is satisfied only when the right hand side of the maxwell - ampre equation , @xmath57 , vanishes .",
    "thus the magnetic force acting on a line element @xmath58 at @xmath59 is @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "we have @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "this is equal to the force for a point magnetic charge @xmath70 placed at @xmath66 .",
    "it is surprising that the sum of the forces acting on each part of the solenoid can be represented in terms only of the magnetic field @xmath71 at the end point @xmath66 .",
    "this is because the partial force is proportional to the ( vector ) gradient of the magnetic field .",
    "now we can calculate the force ( [ eq140 ] ) on solenoid b by the field ( [ eq80 ] ) generated by solenoid a ; @xmath72 this equation corresponds to coulomb s law for magnetic charges @xmath48 at @xmath10 and @xmath73 at @xmath66 : @xmath74 these two equations are exactly the same but the former is for the total ( integrated ) force between currents of solenoids and the latter is for the force between magnetic point charges .",
    "it is interesting that the force is independent of the paths of either solenoids as long as their end points and strengths are kept constant .",
    "we should note that the derivation of the magnetic coulomb law is not straightforward .",
    "the properties of static , source - free fields must be utilized .",
    "now we are interested in the torque due to the integrated magnetic force on a thin , semi - infinite solenoid .",
