    "in the last few years , the advent of magnetospheric models ( e.g. @xcite ) based on the idea of self - organised criticality ( soc ) ( e.g. @xcite ) or more general critical phenomena has stimulated new efforts towards the identification of those features of the magnetosphere which are robust and repeatable in statistical studies taken over arbitrarily long periods of time .",
    "this new knowledge therefore provides potentially important information for studies of magnetospheric  space climate \" ( e.g. @xcite ) , as distinct from the many case studies of individual magnetospheric events , in particular magnetic storms and substorms , a field increasingly referred to as  space weather \" .",
    "soc models typically have power law probability density functions ( pdfs ) and  1/f \" power spectra ( psds ) for energy release from the system , signals of a multiscale process with no preferred scale in space or time .    in mathematical economics , the robust and repeatable mathematical properties of an economic index or other variable",
    "are sometimes referred to as  stylised facts \" ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we seek to establish some of the stylised facts of the magnetosphere , and to sketch out a possible type of simple model for some of its outputs .",
    "we have chosen the specific example of the @xmath0 indices ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "our purpose is twofold :    firstly we wish to collect some still - relevant results on the space climatology of the indices which were obtained before the rise of the soc paradigm ( see also the earlier review of @xcite ) .",
    "new findings in this area tend now to be exclusively interpreted within a framework such as soc or other nonequilibrium critical phenomena such as noise assisted topological phase transitions .",
    "it seems to us , however , that such behaviour will be most clearly demonstrable if an alternative framework is developed in parallel that seeks to encompass the data but does not require avalanching or self - regulation ( see also @xcite ) . if and when such a description fails , the manner in which it does so would make much more convincing the need for an soc ( or more generally a self - regulating description ) .",
    "insofar as it works , however , such a description is a useful mathematical tool for quantifying the risk of extremes in the indices , and possibly also in mathematically analogous solar wind quantities .",
    "secondly , we wish to reiterate our reasons for thinking that the scale - free behaviour of the auroral indices need not necessarily have the same origin as the scale free behaviour seen in newer observations , most notably those based on ultraviolet images .",
    "this is important because the modelling of the indices is of continuing space weather / climate interest , but should neither be restricted by the soc paradigm or be a restriction on the construction of magnetospheric soc models unless it is actually necessary .",
    "it is worth stressing that such arguments are by no means unique to the present author , or the topic of magnetospheric physics .",
    "@xcite have recently given a clear statement of the need for the construction of such null models , commenting on a claim of soc in queues in the uk national health service .",
    "they illustrate that in this case identical behaviour to that observed is also seen in ( non self - regulating ) brownian motion . more generally , a very clear discussion of the extent to which self - regulating models are needed to explain the ubiquitous scale - free phenomena in natural and man - made systems has been given by @xcite ( see also his recent summary @xcite ) . in the plasma context",
    "@xcite has given an explicit counter - example to the idea that power law tails in time - domain correlation functions are necessarily evidence of soc .",
    "the present paper is an attempt to make some initial developments of this approach in magnetospheric physics , extending some of the ideas first expressed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : partly because they have been extensively used as proxies for * energy * dissipation , and thus can be treated as dynamical variables in chaos or soc - inspired studies , the attributes of the @xmath0 indices have been widely studied . in section 1",
    "we present a critical summary of what has been learned about the indices .",
    "we discuss whether soc is necessary to account for the stylised facts of the indices .",
    "in particular we make the suggestion that ae may be satisfactorily explained as a solar - wind driven component modelled by a multiplicative processes , such as fractional lognormal motion , if coupled with a second component , describing the intrinsic  unloading \" behaviour . in section 2 we discuss several questions that we believe need to be answered more fully in order to clarify the most appropriate model for @xmath0 .",
    "in particular we note that systems with lognormal amplitude distributions , when also exhibiting time domain persistence , will tend to give power law - like pdfs for the burst measures previously applied to ae , without the presence of self - organisation , or even truly scale - free amplitude behaviour .",
    "we suggest that this kind of  persistent lognormality \" is a suitable null model against which soc should be tested in the auroral indices , and may well have more widespread relevance . in section 3",
    "we discuss newer auroral imager - derived measurements which promise to identify soc behaviour more unambiguously , and we draw attention to the existence of a magnetic reconnection - based physical model which may explain some aspects of these most recent results .",
    "section 4 gives our conclusions . because of the deliberately narrow focus of this paper we have not dealt with all of the available literature on soc in the magnetosphere . in consequence the reader",
    "is encouraged to consult the review papers by @xcite and @xcite , and also the extended discussions of the evidence for soc and/or soc - like multiscale behaviour in the magnetosphere given by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite      @xmath0 estimates maximal ionospheric current densities via the upper ( @xmath4 ) and lower ( @xmath2 ) envelopes of magnetic perturbations and is usually derived from 12 magnetometers underneath the mean position of the auroral electrojets . the total envelope @xmath5 . in figure 1a",
    "we show an example of three days of the @xmath0 time series in early 1975 , as studied by @xcite .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the first difference of @xmath0 ( figure 1b ) shows apparent  burstiness \" .",
    "however a fractional lognormal motion ( flm ) - a fractional brownian motion ( e.g. @xcite ) with a lognormal rather than gaussian distribution of amplitudes - would also show such burstiness .",
    "more significantly the first difference of @xmath6 is also bursty , whereas an flm would show a normal distribution in that quantity ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "this suggests that a single fractional lognormal motion would fail as a model of @xmath0 .     for 4000 minutes in 1975 , as plotted by @xcite .",
    "the second panel ( figure 1b ) shows the first differences of the data , while the third and fourth panels ( figures 1c and 1d ) show the natural logarithm of @xmath0 and its first difference .",
    "the impulsiveness noted by @xcite for the data seen in figure 1b is still present in figure 1d , title=\"fig:\",width=566,height=377 ]   for 4000 minutes in 1975 , as plotted by @xcite .",
    "the second panel ( figure 1b ) shows the first differences of the data , while the third and fourth panels ( figures 1c and 1d ) show the natural logarithm of @xmath0 and its first difference .",
    "the impulsiveness noted by @xcite for the data seen in figure 1b is still present in figure 1d , title=\"fig:\",width=566,height=377 ]     for the period january 1978 to june 1978,width=566 ]    this conclusion is consistent with the fact that @xcite found @xmath0 to have a two component probability distribution function ( pdf ) , well described by two quasi - lognormal distributions , one of which had an exponential cutoff .",
    "a similar result was shown by @xcite for @xmath7 . in figure 2",
    "we show that two lognormals , with the standard prefactor and without exponential modification , give a very good fit to the pdf of @xmath0 for the period january 1978 to june 1978 .       using same approach as that in @xcite but for 1 year rather than 3 .",
    "a similar spectrum is seen over the shorter period , though the 24 hour peak is not clear in only one year s data.,width=566 ]    while the range of amplitudes present in ae is described by the pdf one may study @xmath0 in the frequency domain by fourier analysis . @xcite",
    "used the welch averaged periodogram to obtain a power spectral density for 5-minute @xmath0 data for the periods 1978 - 80 and 1967 - 70 .",
    "the  broken power law \" spectrum they obtained is typical of @xmath0 even for shorter runs of data ( see e.g. figure 3 where tsurutani et al s approach is applied to 1 year of @xmath0 data ) .",
    "the @xmath8 behaviour is seen essentially all the time but @xcite has shown that the higher frequency @xmath9 component is present for high activity levels .",
    "the power spectral density can be described in terms of two components , one of which ( the  @xmath8 \" part ) indicates long range f correlation in time .",
    "the autocorrelation function ( acf ) of a time series @xmath10 @xmath11 allows one to express the above behaviour in the time rather than the frequency domain .",
    "@xcite found an acf with qualitatively two - component behaviour ( see figure 4 which is a replotting of their figure 1 with the data they used ) .",
    "the long - range tail becomes progressively clearer as one observes longer and longer ( 20 days or more ) time series , though in figure 4 we follow @xcite by plotting only lags up to 500 minutes .",
    "even for short runs of data ( 5 days ) , however , a fast - dropping exponential acf is seen , for which the normalised amplitude halves in about 100 minutes . as noted by @xcite ",
    "fast decaying autocorrelation functions and power spectra resembling white noise ( or  @xmath9 `` power spectra for the integrated variable ) are ` fingerprints ' of short range correlated stochastic processes '' .",
    "two classic examples of such processes are the velocity of a brownian particle ( e.g. @xcite ) and the  random telegraph \" ( a poisson - switched on - off pulse train ( e.g. @xcite ) ) .     taken over 5 , 20 , 100 and 200 days in 1983.,width=566 ]    in order to further examine the time - domain behaviour of the @xmath0 series , @xcite studied the second order structure function @xmath12 .",
    "this is defined as @xmath13 with @xmath14 denoting a time average . on the assumption of stationarity",
    "this equates to @xmath15 .",
    "a self - affine ( e.g. @xcite ) signal has @xmath16 ( @xcite ) and",
    "so a log - log plot of @xmath17 versus @xmath18 for such a self - affine signal would give a slope equal to @xmath19 .",
    "however , as we have discussed elsewhere ( @xcite ) , an exponential form for the acf , whatever its cause , must necessarily imply a region of * @xmath20 * scaling in the structure function .",
    "the taylor series expansion of the exponential means that the inferred @xmath19 value must be @xmath21 ( @xcite ) , and so the nearly linear scaling region with @xmath22 seen by @xcite might be just another manifestation of the observed exponential autocorrelation , rather than in itself necessarily implying that the high frequency part of the @xmath0 signal is a scale free coloured noise .      the advent of the idea of self - organised criticality led @xcite and @xcite to study  bursts \" in the @xmath0 index time series .",
    "these bursts were defined using a constant threshold method whereby the set @xmath23 denotes all the upcrossings of a given threshold , and the set @xmath24 all the downcrossings , so burst  size \" @xmath25 is given by    @xmath26    while  durations \" and  waiting times \" are given by the intervals between a given @xmath27 and the next @xmath28 , and that between a @xmath28 and the next @xmath27 respectively .",
    "the first studies of the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath25 were both on a single year s data , and the resulting distributions of @xmath25 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 were all power laws with an exponential roll - off .",
    "study of longer time series later showed , however ( e.g. ( @xcite ) , that the scale - free behaviour was interrupted by a bump in both the burst size and duration pdfs .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this is that there are two components in @xmath0 , presumably the same two components seen in the psd and pdf of @xmath0 itself , although this raises several questions which will be discussed below ( see also the extended discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "if there are effectively two components to the @xmath0 time series then a natural question is  where do they come from \" ?",
    "because of the long - established evidence for the driving of the @xmath31 convection currents ( e.g. @xcite ) ( believed to be the most continuous contributor to the @xmath0 index ) by the solar wind , @xcite performed an identical constant threshold burst duration analysis on the solar wind @xmath32 and @xmath33 functions , and also on the @xmath4 and @xmath2 indices .",
    "it was found that burst lifetimes in all four quantities showed power laws with very similar slopes .",
    "however , the aforementioned bump in the burst duration signal was seen only in the magnetospheric signals . because the bump was larger in @xmath7 ( mainly drawn from post - midnight stations ) than @xmath4 ( mainly dusk )",
    ", @xcite inferred that the bump was the signature of the substorm @xmath34 current .",
    "the inference drawn from this study was that the scale - free component in @xmath0 was most probably a consequence of scale - free behaviour in the solar wind , and that the  bump \" was an objective identification of the substorm with a characteristic time scale .",
    "a number of important criticisms may be raised of the result , however .",
    "obviously it was not ideal to use non - contemporary time series ( 1978 - 88 for the @xmath4 and @xmath2 indices and 1995 - 98 for the solar wind data ) .",
    "unfortunately no 2 simultaneous datasets of many years length were available for @xmath35 and the solar wind data .",
    "this problem was addressed in part by comparison between the burst duration pdfs taken from a 4-year period of the @xmath4 and @xmath2 series and the existing solar wind burst pdfs from an equivalent phase of the solar cycle .",
    "no significant difference was seen between the burst pdfs taken from this section and those from a full 10 year series of @xmath0 .",
    "the main justification for the approach used , however , is the remarkable stability of the * bi - lognormal aspect of * underlying pdf of @xmath0 .",
    "while the curves vary in parameters , they can consistently be fitted by bi - lognormal fits . in consequence , if as we suspect , the power laws found are partially a consequence of the",
    " 1/x \" power law scaling region present in a lognormal distribution ( @xcite ) regardless of its parameters , they will be stable from year to year .",
    "each curve in figure 5 is the pdf of of @xmath0 taken over one of the years from 1978 to 1988 .",
    "a similar stability was found by @xcite in pdfs of the solar wind velocity , density and temperature during the period from which the wind measurements were taken .     taken over one of the years from 1978 to 1988.,width=566 ]    in addition , to eliminate the effect of the angle @xmath36 which represents the solar wind - magnetosphere coupling process in akosofu et al s @xmath33 function",
    ", @xcite subsequently examined the pdfs for burst durations , waiting times and sizes in the radial solar wind poynting flux .",
    "both durations and waiting times could be fitted by identical exponentially - truncated power laws , while the apparent power law region in burst size is also reminiscent of long - ranged lognormal distributions ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite have examined a contemporary , pair of datasets for solar wind @xmath33 and @xmath0 ( although the series are shorter ( 6 months ) and 5 minute resolution ) .",
    "they find different scaling behaviours for time - averaged activity and event survival probability in the two signals , and an apparent break in the scaling of the dependence of @xmath0 burst size on duration .",
    "they interpreted these results as evidence of a distinct internal magnetospheric dynamical component in the @xmath0 signal .",
    "it is straightforward to illustrate how some of the above conjectures can be checked by using a numerical realisation of fractional lognormal noise .",
    "the details will be presented elsewhere but we here sketch how such a process may be used to approximate the  1/f \" component of the ae series .",
    "we postpone to a subsequent work implementation of a suitable model of the second , unloading , component that has been postulated above , but note that a first order approximation to the  1/f@xmath37 \" term was presented in @xcite .",
    "we made a time series of fractional lognormal motion with zero mean and unit standard deviation , and spectral exponent @xmath38 , using the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "taking the spacing of the data to be 1 minute , we plot 4000 points from the resulting time series in figure 6 . from a longer series",
    "we have confirmed that power law pdfs for size , duration and waiting times of bursts as defined in e.g. @xcite do indeed result from such a model , while we also see size - duration relations , with scale breaks , qualitatively similar to those seen by @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum and amplitude distribution of @xmath39 are , as expected , @xmath40 and lognormal , while perhaps more surprisingly , the differenced time series @xmath41 has leptokurtic tails and shows a range over which a scaling collapse of the type described by @xcite can be demonstrated . however agreement with with observed autocorrelation functions and hurst exponent measures is relatively poor , confirming that we need to include a representation of the unloading component before a useful comparison can be made .",
    "we note that fractional lognormal motion has several competitors as a model of real anaomalous diffusion , most notably truncated levy flights , and continuous time levy flights , the latter being generalised random walks in which levy stable increments are combined with a random distribution of times between steps @xcite .",
    "we plan to investigate these alternatiives to find an optimum description of the driven component of ae .    .",
    "the second panel shows the first difference ( compare figure 1b ) , the third panel shows the natural log of y ( compare figure 1c ) , while the fourth panel shows the differenced log y time series , in which the intermittency apparent in the second panel has disappeared .",
    ", width=566 ]      we may summarise the above non - exhaustive collection of  stylised facts \" about @xmath0 , with some tentative interpretations , as follows .    1",
    ".   the @xmath0 time series has more than one component ( see also e.g. table 5.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath0 has more than one component it may not necessarily mean that more than one process is at work .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that a sandpile model could produce both a scale - free and non - scale - free component , where the non -scale - free component is identified with the systemwide events in the model ) .",
    "at least one of the components in @xmath0 is long - range correlated ( and fractal ) in time .",
    "this observed long range correlation may originate in that * present * in the solar wind poynting flux , a hypothesis supported by the identical power laws seen both in waiting time and burst duration by @xcite , as expected for the isosets of a fractal random walk ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one component apparently has a characteristic time scale , which @xcite identify with the substorm .",
    "the pdf of the @xmath0 signal itself is apparently not scale free , but rather is well described by a bi - lognormal .",
    "however it is already known that such distributions are also very good approximations to underlying multifractal cascades ( see e.g. the discussion in @xcite ) , and so , because of evidence for multifractality in @xmath0 ( e.g. @xcite ) , we admit that a fractional lognormal noise component may be a less well motivated choice of model for the long range correlated part of @xmath0 than it might at first seem . 7 .   nonetheless it is possible that the power law pdf for burst durations and waiting times results simply because one part of the @xmath0 signal is well approximated by fractional lognormal noise . in consequence",
    "the less clear cut scaling in burst size would then result from the convolution ( implicit in the method used to define bursts ) between the non scale - free amplitude pdf and the genuinely scale - free persistent property of the @xmath0 time series .",
    "the long range time correlation and long tailed pdfs seen in @xmath0 can be physically motivated by sporadic , localised energy release events in the magnetotail , and can be modelled by sandpile algorithms ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the observed 2-component property discussed above can also be accounted for ; at least if we make the hypothesis of a difference between systemwide and internal energy release events .",
    "however , a number of issues arise from the summary presented above , and it is still the view of the present author that more definitive answers to the following questions are needed , to establish more clearly if soc is a necessary explanation for the behaviour of @xmath0 rather than a possible one .      the answer to this would seem to be no , in that one may have long - range correlation in time , signalled by ",
    "@xmath8 \" spectra , in many other classes of process , some of which are not spatially long range correlated at all .",
    "conversely , some ( but not all ) soc models ( most notably the orginal btw model ( @xcite ) ) , do not exhibit long range time correlation in their outputs . in consequence , it is neither advisable to test for soc relying only on ",
    "@xmath8 \" spectra nor to use the power law waiting times seen in shell models as a test against soc ( see also @xcite and references therein , where this issue is discussed in reference to solar flares , and the discussion in the context of fusion plasmas of @xcite ) .",
    "the problem with interpreting power laws in burst size as evidence of scale free behaviour is that one may also have a time - correlated lognormal process ( see e.g. the simulations presented in figure 19 of @xcite , and the illustrative time series shown in figure 6 ) . integrating a times series of the amplitude of such a process in the region where it mimics a power law ( e.g. figures 4.2 and 4.3 in @xcite ) gives rise to a power - law like burst distribution ,",
    "provided that the signal is persistent in time .",
    "in fact even burst distributions constructed from a gaussian persistent process are remarkably power - law like ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "we thus currently need to consider  persistent lognormality \" as well as soc as an alternative explanation for the stylised facts of @xmath0 bursts .",
    "it has been remarked [ channon price , personal communication , 1999 ] that the monofractal nature of the burst duration distributions seen would seem hard to reconcile with the apparent biaffine nature of the power spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "this is because a mono - fractal ( or bifractal ) should give the same h value ( or values ) to both 1st order and 2nd order measures .",
    "the resolution of this apparent paradox is that a mixed signal , which has a fractal part and a non - fractal part does not have this limitation .",
    "a first order measure like burst duration basically measures the length of a fractal curve ( because the slope of the isoset distribution is governed by the fractal dimension of the curve which is crossing the threshold ) .",
    "if a signal has a fractal component which accounts for most of the curve , it may take a long time series for the non - fractal part to become apparent . in the author",
    "s view this is the reason why the bump in @xmath0 burst sizes needed a long time series ( as used by @xcite ) to become apparent , rather than the 1-year series studied by @xcite .    a second order measure such as @xmath42 , conversely , measures the distribution of variance in a signal , because of the formal equivalence between the information in @xmath42 and that in the acf or power spectrum . a sharp change in level in the time series caused by a non - fractal substorm component can be revealed by the @xmath9 power spectrum it gives rise to at high frequencies .",
    "the presence of such a non - fractal component explains why , in contrast with first order methods , the power spectrum reveals a spectral break in even as few as 4 days of @xmath0 data , and it is clearly apparent in figure 3 taken from 1 year of @xmath0 data .",
    "it seems to be increasingly accepted ( e.g. @xcite ) that some part of the scale - free behaviour of the @xmath0 signal comes from the scale - free solar wind driver .",
    "however two caveats need to be noted .",
    "one is that , as with @xmath0 , the solar wind probably also has a multifractal character , and so comparison of fractal dimensions as in @xcite between the solar wind and au / al is really just comparing measures at one order .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the higher order structure functions of low pass filtered , solar wind magnetic field fluctuations and those for an unfiltered ground - based magnetometer signal were * also * in close agreement .",
    "more importantly , the hurst exponent for a signal is its roughness averaged over many length scales . even if the @xmath0 output is nonlinearly driven by the solar wind , similar roughness values in the output and the driver would not require individual bursts to be the same . in consequence",
    "the absence of one to one mappings between integrated input power and @xmath0 bursts , as found by @xcite , may not be so surprising .",
    "we will return to this point in future work .",
    "for all the above reasons , better indicators of soc behaviour than those derived from @xmath0 are needed in the magnetospheric case . @xcite",
    "have recently shown remarkably clear power laws in several burst measures drawn from time - evolving ",
    "blobs \" seen by the uvi auroral imager on the wind satellite . while more studies are necessary , a particularly interesting result is the @xmath43 power law that they observe in the time integrated energy of blobs .",
    "following @xcite in assuming that the blobs they observed in uvi data correspond to magnetic reconnection events in the magnetotail , it is tempting to explain the observed energy spectrum using the results of @xcite .",
    "he was considering simple models of solar flares and showed that an @xmath44 power law is exactly the spectrum to be expected from distributed reconnection events with 2d current sheet geometry , using the known properties of analytic solutions for reconnection and a relatively conservative set of additional assumptions .",
    "the optical observations of @xcite thus suggest soc or least more obviously soc - like behaviour more directly than @xmath0 .",
    "they illustrate clearly how by studying different physical quantities or measures will help better answer the question of whether soc is present in the magnetosphere .",
    "soc is not yet needed to explain the properties of @xmath0 s time series : at least where the pdf , power spectrum , structure function and  burst statistics \" are concerned . nonetheless , because soc is an economical and physically motivated approach to capturing these properties , further studies are needed to clarify some outstanding issues , in particular the relationship between solar wind scaling and that seen in @xmath0 .",
    "a recent pointer to how the soc investigations may be advanced is the demonstration of power law scaling in spatiotemporal events in a signal ( uvi images ) which may be less ambiguous than the necessarily  mixed \" signal seen by @xmath0 .",
