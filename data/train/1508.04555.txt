    "if the orbit of a point @xmath0 under a holomorphic map @xmath1 is finite , we say that @xmath0 is pre - periodic . if there exists @xmath2 satisfying @xmath3 , then @xmath0 is periodic ; in particular , @xmath0 is a fixed point if @xmath4 .",
    "periodic points are classified in terms of their multipliers @xmath5 : if @xmath6 , @xmath0 is an attracting , if @xmath7 , @xmath0 is a repelling , and if @xmath8 , @xmath0 is an indifferent periodic point .",
    "we are interested in the case @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a rational number , i.e. , @xmath0 is a parabolic periodic point . in this case",
    "there are some neighborhoods where points are attracted to @xmath0 , and some where the points are repelled under the @xmath11th iterate .",
    "these are called _ attracting and repelling petals _ , respectively .",
    "the map @xmath12 is conjugate to translation @xmath13 , by a pair of univalent maps in attracting and repelling petals , which are called _ the fatou coordinates_. +   + the dynamical plane for a homolorphic map @xmath1 is partitioned into two totally invariant sets with respect to the behavior of the points ; the set of points with stable behavior , i.e. , the domain of normality of the iterates @xmath14 , and its complement , i.e. , the set of points with nonstable behavior .",
    "these two complementary sets are called the _ fatou set _ , and the _ julia set _ , respectively . in order to understand the topology of the julia set , the main strategy is considered to be the study of rays and their landing behaviors . roughly speaking ,",
    "dynamic rays are unbounded curves in the escaping set ( i.e. , the set of points which escape to infinity under iteration ) , formed by orbits escaping to infinity according to some symbolic dynamics .",
    "a dynamic ray @xmath15 for a holomorphic map @xmath1 is periodic if there exists @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 , and in particular , is fixed if @xmath18 .",
    "we say @xmath19 lands if @xmath20 exists .",
    "+   + similar to the analysis in the dynamical plane , the study of the parameter spaces can be considered in terms of the study of curves consisting of escaping parameters and in terms of their landing behaviors .",
    "those rays are called parameter rays . by escaping parameter , we mean a parameter for which the singular value ( i.e. , a point with the property that , at least one of the inverse branches of the map is not well - defined , and not univalent in any neighborhood of it ) escapes to infinity along dynamic rays with a prescribed ( combinatorial ) identification .",
    "we say a parameter ray @xmath21 lands if @xmath22 exists .",
    "+   + there are two main questions in the study of rays : whether a ray lands , or a considered point is a landing point of a ray . in order to distinguish these two questions , we use the terms `` landing '' and `` converse landing '' , respectively .",
    "it is of course reasonable to study the existence of curve structure first , and then to explore landing behaviors . to the question of the existence of rays for transcendental entire families , although computer simulations suggest that escaping parameters form curves in the parameter spaces , there is no complete answer , except for the exponential family .",
    "the first study of the existence of parameter rays in the exponential family was carried out by devaney and coauthors in @xcite .",
    "schleicher worked broadly on combinatorial analysis of the exponential family in his habilitation thesis @xcite , and his student frster completed the construction of the parameter rays in his diploma thesis @xcite with a combinatorial perspective , which then appeared in @xcite .",
    "however , landing properties of periodic parameter rays in the habilitation thesis is still unpublished . to our knowledge",
    ", nothing has been proved for transcendental entire families in a general setting . in this paper , we prove a converse landing theorem for curves in the parameter spaces of holomorphic families of holomorphic maps .",
    "the theorem itself already gives the existence of _ a fixed parameter curve ( or a fixed parameter ray piece ) _ in a bounded sector which lands at a parabolic parameter . by a fixed parameter curve , we mean a curve in the parameter plane , consisting of parameter values , for which the singular value is on a fixed dynamic ray with a prescribed ( combinatorial ) identification ( for simplicity of the notation , we consider fixed rays , which we can also apply for the @xmath11th iterate of a @xmath11-periodic ray ) .",
    "so in some sense , this can be considered as a partial answer to the existence problem of the parameter rays , particularly in transcendental entire families .",
    "+   + our proof relies on having a holomorphic motion in a subset of the escaping set . in polynomial dynamics",
