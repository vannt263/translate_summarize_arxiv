    "<S> .    field theoretic q balls are more general than the non - relativistic limit on which we focus here . </S>",
    "<S> thus@xcite the above - mentioned baryonic q balls , made of squark condensates , are stable against  weak interaction like \" decays of the heavy individual squarks by having the q balls very tightly bound with masses proportional to a fractional power of the total baryon number @xmath12 rather than @xmath13 as expected for non - relativistic weakly bound matter .    </S>",

    "<S> bec is best understood when the atoms are non - interacting@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand the _ coordinate _ space  condensation \" of bosons into coleman s  q balls \" is due to attraction between the bosons . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the field theoretical formulation coleman has proved that stable q balls exist if and only if thepotential \" @xmath3 in the effective low - energy lagrangian for the system satisfies : @xmath18 with @xmath19 the mass in the  free \" part of @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> .    the size @xmath21 of the spherical q ball and its density @xmath22 are fixed by the overall q and @xmath11the field for which the above minimum is achieved .    condition ( i ) implies over all attractive interactions between the @xmath4 bosons , say , the kaons in strangeness balls , at an appropriate density . </S>",

    "<S> thus , a nontrivial minimum , @xmath11 , of @xmath29 can obtain with a negative @xmath30 term overcoming at some @xmath4 the positive @xmath31 . still this can be problematic : the minimum of @xmath29 may now be at a large @xmath11 , say , @xmath32 where the nr many - body approach that we want to compare with next , fails .    </S>",

''    for finite range potentials the n - body schrdinger equation @xmath39 with @xmath40 \\label{finiterange }    \\ ] ] is trivially solved by @xmath41 which is a product of single particle wave functions , each of which is ( approaching ) a constant . </S>",
    "<S> the spread - out particles have vanishing kinetic energies and vanishing mutual interactions and thus @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> for many potentials a lower ( negative ) energy state exists with the @xmath14 bosons in a sphere of radius @xmath21 . using the basic variational principle </S>",

    "<S> let us first use a simple trial wave function with all bosons in the same state  the ground state of a large radius @xmath21 spherical cavity : @xmath43 the expectation values of the kinetic and potential energies appearing in @xmath44 are : @xmath45 and , if @xmath46 = the range of the potential , @xmath47 } \\sim [ n^2/(4 \\pi r^3/3 ) ] v$ ] , with @xmath48 and n = n/(volume ) the particle number density . </S>",
    "<S> a possible relation to the previous section stems from the fact that , up to kinematic factors , @xmath49 is the born approximation for the s - wave boson - boson scattering length . for dilute systems with inter - particle separation which far exceed the range of the potential : </S>",

    "<S> such a potential roughly corresponds to the negative local @xmath52 term  which in the field theoretic formulation suffices to ensure stable q balls . to complete the analogy with the nrs case </S>",
    "<S> we show that if @xmath53 , then also the expectation value of the energy @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this readily follows from the different scalings of the ( expectation values of ) the positive kinetic and negative potential energy @xmath14 , the number of bosons in the system : @xmath55 for @xmath56 . by the variational principle </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the true n - body ground state is lower than @xmath57 and also negative and a many - body bound droplet or q ball stable state indeed exists if : @xmath58 like ( ii ) , ( ii@xmath59 ) does _ not _ fix the actual size / density of the  droplet \" . </S>",
    "<S> still the two conditions are _ not _ equivalent .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath49 , depends only on the potential @xmath60 and not the mass @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> it is ( proportional to ) the actual s - wave scattering length ( or to the coefficient of the @xmath61 term in @xmath3 _ only _ in the born ( or dilute system ) approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> scattering theory@xcite implies that the s - wave scattering length is attractive if and only if the nrs ( non - relativistic schrdinger ) two - body system has bound states . </S>",
    "<S> thus the nrs equivalent of the field theoretic condition ( ii ) is having a two - body bound state of the nrs equation . </S>",
    "<S> indeed as we directly show below having two - boson bound states guarantees @xmath14 bosons bound state . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , the independence of the two nrs criteria : the criterion ( ii@xmath59 ) ensuring n @xmath62 nrs  droplets \" does _ not _ ensure an s - wave two - body bound state . in three dimensions </S>",
    "<S> the latter requires not only an  attractive \" potential , but also sufficiently strong attraction .    various criteria for @xmath60 to have bound states in a nr two - body system with reduced mass @xmath36 exist.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> yet there is no general _ if and only if _ criterion , short of solving the schrdinger equation . finding if a bound state of @xmath38 bosons exists need not be easier . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the field theoretic criterion ( i ) requires the full effective potential @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients in the power series for the latter are the threshold scattering amplitudes for any number of particles and can not be found short of solving exactly the field theory .      </S>",
    "<S> for many atomic and other systems , the many - body nrs treatment preceded field theoretic approaches and laughlin s celebrated variational wave function for the fractional quantum hall effect is a prime example of this . in recent years much effort has been devoted to applying field theory in general , and effective field theories and effective lagrangians in particular , to such problems and this has been also the case for the q balls.@xcite chiral lagrangians were used to check if coleman s criterion ( i ) holds for the @xmath0 system . </S>",
    "<S> these lagrangians involve higher derivative terms and are fixed by an overall fit to data yet they do not offer much intuitive understanding . here </S>",
    "<S> we follow the _ reverse _ program of  demystifying \" q balls and trying to explain them  at least in the nrs regime  as simple spatial condensations of many bosons with appropriate potentials . </S>",
    "<S> strangeness - balls , and even more so , charm / beauty - balls with densities @xmath63 are nr . in all cases we expect to have essentially the same boson - boson potentials as the later are controlled by the common light @xmath64 quark . </S>",

    "<S> , to find if  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 , etc . , droplets \" form  which we do next  is justified .    </S>",
    "<S> a first key observation is that the @xmath67 potential , as that between _ any _ two identical , neutral , pseudo - scalars , is _ attractive _ at  large \" @xmath68 fermi distance . to show this we write @xmath60 as a superposition ( integral ) of yukawa potentials due to all exchanges@xcite : @xmath69    </S>",
    "<S> parity conservation forbids a @xmath70 vertex and the lightest exchanged system controlling @xmath60 at @xmath71 is that of two pions . </S>",
    "<S> further , the @xmath72 component dominates at the @xmath73 threshold : @xmath74 with @xmath75 , the @xmath76 s - wave amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this expression is clearly positive and recalling the minus sign in the definition of @xmath60 we find that the longest range two - pion exchange potential is indeed attractive </S>",
    "<S> . this can be also directly shown to be the case for the exchange of a @xmath77 state which can be an s - wave resonance in the @xmath78 s - wave system . </S>",
    "<S> the above reasoning is similar to that used in @xcite to derive the well - known attractive casimir polder ( i.e retarded van der waals ) and the regular van der waals two photon - exchange potential between two identical neutral atoms .    at short distances of the order of the size of the @xmath79 composite state , which _ is _ the kaon in quark models / qcd , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath80 potential becomes repulsive . as in atomic physics </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the pauli principle  operating here between the identical @xmath81 or @xmath82 quarks in the two @xmath0 s . </S>",
    "<S> the repulsion can also be viewed as being due to the exchange of the @xmath83 vector mesons : the two @xmath0 s have the same hypercharge ( isospin ) to which @xmath83 couple@xcite ; no light @xmath77 , scalar  @xmath84 \" meson has been established . yet , </S>",
    "<S> the exchange of such an entity with appropriate mass and coupling to nucleons @xmath85 ( which may represent the box diagram with two pions exchanged and intermediate @xmath14 and @xmath86 states ) could , along with @xmath87 exchange , dominate nuclear binding@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> parameterizing , @xmath88 with @xmath89 or @xmath90 at a common mass @xmath91 and @xmath92 the sum of the ( squared ) @xmath90 and @xmath87 couplings to kaons we find : @xmath93 to evaluate ( [ rhoomegacouplings ] ) we take @xmath94 and @xmath95 , as suggested by counting the numbers of non - strange quarks . using the values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 suggested by fitting nuclear matter in eq . </S>",
