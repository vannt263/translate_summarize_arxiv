    "x - ray computed tomography ( ct ) is a widely used diagnostic tool for medical and dental tomographic imaging of the human body . it provides tomographic images of the human body by assigning an x - ray attenuation coefficient to each pixel @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the ( unknown ) image to be reconstructed .",
    "we further assume that @xmath0 is supported in the unit ball @xmath1 in @xmath2 . in the case of two dimensional parallel beam ct",
    ", the projection data ( or sinogram ) @xmath3 for each @xmath4 and @xmath5 is obtained via the following radon transform @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "then the tomographic image @xmath0 is reconstructed via the following radon inversion formula @xcite : @xmath9dsd\\varphi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 .    however , the limitation of lies in the fact that it requires so - called _ complete data _ @xcite , which means that the measured projection data should cover at least the range @xmath11 . in the case of",
    "_ limited data _ where the sinogram @xmath12 is measured only on a subset of @xmath13 due to the reduced size of detector @xcite and/or the reduced number of projections @xcite , the reconstruction is more ill - posed than the complete data case @xcite . in particular , if the projection data is available only on @xmath14 given as @xmath15 then there exists a nontrivial function @xmath16 called the amgibuity of @xmath17 @xcite , i.e. @xmath18 in @xmath19 @xcite . since it has been proven that @xmath16 is nonconstant in the region of interest ( roi ) @xmath20 @xcite , the reconstructed image via with the projection data @xmath3 restricted on @xmath21 will be deteriorated by this ambiguity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ issue_data_truncation ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table [ table41 ] and [ table42 ] respectively depict the psnr and the mssim values of the tested models for each cases . at first , we can see that compared with the fbp , all reconstructed methods yield the reconstructed images with better quantities both in psnr and mssim .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown from the tables that our proposed method outperforms the sparsity model based method .",
    "moreover , we can see that the image reconstructed by the data driven frame based method is the closest to the original image in the sense of mssim , because at each step we learn tight frames @xmath22 and @xmath23 that best represent @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "finally , we also observe that the data driven frame based model can recover the image if the number of projections is reduced to @xmath26 . in",
    "the previous researches on the limited tomography , it is in general to increase the number of projections @xcite .",
    "however , it is mentioned in @xcite that the ambiguity and/or the artifact due to the truncated projection data still remains in the reconstructed image . moreover , from the clinical viewpoint , it is not desirable to increase the number of projections too much because of the x - ray radiation dosage . on the other hand , our proposed data driven frame based method can work very well with the smaller number of projections .",
    "this implies that our method can be helpful for the reduction of x - ray radiation dosage , one of the most challenging issues in the current field of x - ray ct .",
    "however , our method has a limitation . during the numerical simulation",
    ", it has been observed that even though large @xmath27 and @xmath28 can make the reconstructed image more noise - free , but it fails to recover the missing parts of the ct image . on the other hand , small @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "can make the reconstructed image noisy , but it performs much better in recovering the image outside of the roi . in addition , it requires a mathematical analysis to which extent of data truncation we can reconstruct the entire ct image uniquely and stably .",
    "even though our reconstruction method via tight frame and simultaneous sinogram extrapolation method has shown a promising result of recovering the missing part of image due to the truncated projection data , further researches will be needed to improve the quality of reconstructed images .",
    "this paper presents a method of image reconstruction via tight frame and simulataneous sinogram extrapolation for limited tomography .",
    "the numerical simulation shows that our proposed model with tight frames presents a possibility of reconstructing the entire image from the limited knowledge of the projection data .",
    "in addition , the missing part of an image due to the truncated projection data can be recovered if we reduce the number of projection angles .",
    "future direction of the research will focus on the improvement of the reconstructed ct image quality as well as the theoretical condition on the reconstruction of entire image using the limited sinogram .",
    "provided here is the brief introduction on the concept of tight wavelet frames and data driven tight frames . for more details , one may refer to @xcite for tight wavelet frames and @xcite for the data driven tight frames .",
    "a countable set @xmath29 is called a tight frame of @xmath30 if it satisfies @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the inner product in @xmath30 .",
    "equivalently , every @xmath33 can be expressed as the linear combination of @xmath34 : @xmath35 with @xmath36 being called the canonical coefficient of @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath37 is called a tight wavelet frame if there exists a finite set @xmath38 such that @xmath39 where @xmath40 are called the framelets .",
    "the compactly supported framelets can be generated by applying the unitary extension principle @xcite .",
    "for @xmath41 , the tight wavelet frame system of @xmath42 can be easily constructed by the tensor products of one dimensional framelets @xcite .    in a discrete",
    "setting , a two dimensional image @xmath25 can be regarded as a two dimensional array @xcite .",
    "let @xmath43 denote a discrete framelet decomposition ( or analysis operator ) and let @xmath44 be the fast reconstruction ( or synthesis operator ) .",
    "since two dimensional framelets are generated by the tensor products of univariate framelets satisfying the unitary extension principle @xcite , it follows that @xmath45 finally , an @xmath46-level framelet decomposition of @xmath25 will be denoted as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the index of all framelet bands .",
    "if @xmath49 , we write @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "even though tensor product framelet based approaches are simple to implement and able to achieve sparse representation of a given image , their major disadvantage lies in that these framelets mostly focus on the horizontal and vertical discontinuities @xcite .",
    "for example , when the discontinuities of an image have complex geometries , the tensor product framelet representation may not be sparse enough @xcite .    based on the concept of adaptivity explored by machine learning approaches @xcite",
    ", the goal of data driven tight frame is to construct an adaptive discrete tight frame @xmath43 generated by real valued filters @xmath52 for a given image @xmath25 .",
    "this is achieved by solving the following minimization problem @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of nonzero elements in the coefficient vector @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the analysis operator generated by filters @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the identity operator .    the minimization problem can be solved by updating @xmath55 and @xmath59 alternatively @xcite .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath60 be the initial filters such as the b - spline framelet filters in @xcite .",
    "then for @xmath61 , we have      note that has a closed form solution given by the hard threshold : @xmath68=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccl } \\bsv[\\bk]~&\\text{if}&~|\\bsv[\\bk]|\\geq\\lambda\\vspace{0.2em}\\\\ 0~&\\text{if}&~|\\bsv[\\bk]|<\\lambda . \\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for , the authors in @xcite has shown that under a proper assumption , the optimal solution has a closed form solution , which simplifies the computation significantly @xcite ."
