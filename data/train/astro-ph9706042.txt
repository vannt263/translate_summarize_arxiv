    "excess infrared ( ir ) emission from t tauri stars is thought to arise from circumstellar disks ( mendoza 1968 ; shu , adams & lizano 1987 ; adams , lada , & shu 1987 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the standard disk is modeled as a flat blackbody . in the simplest scenario",
    "it lacks intrinsic luminosity and passively reradiates the energy it absorbs from the central star .",
    "this blackbody model yields an infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the form @xmath0 , with spectral index @xmath1 ( adams , lada , & shu 1987 ; and references therein ) . by coincidence , the steady - state accretional luminosity from an opaque , thin disk yields an sed with identical spectral index ( lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ) .",
    "seds measured between @xmath2 and @xmath3 are usually well fitted by power laws with @xmath4 . however , in contrast to the prediction of the standard model , most sources exhibit flattish spectra having @xmath5 ( see , e.g. , rydgren et al . 1984 ; rucinski 1985 ; rydgren & zak 1987 ; strom et al .",
    "1989 ; beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ) .    the failure of the standard disk model spawned a number of alternative proposals . of greatest relevance here is the investigation by kenyon & hartmann ( 1987 ) of a blackbody disk whose surface flares outward with increasing radius as a consequence of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "flared disks intercept more stellar radiation than flat ones , especially at large distances from the star .",
    "other models invoke either an `` active '' disk having a high intrinsic luminosity , or a dusty component in addition to the disk .",
    "the dissipation of a one - armed spiral density wave as an intrinsic disk heating mechanism falls in the first category ( adams , ruden , & shu 1989 ; shu et al .",
    "1990 ; ostriker , shu , & adams 1992 ) .",
    "the second category includes the proposal that a tenuous dusty envelope surrounds the star / disk system and either scatters stellar radiation back onto the disk ( natta 1993 ) , or absorbs and re - emits it in the infrared ( calvet et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "we calculate the sed for the passive , reprocessing disk in a self - consistent fashion . the basic features and results of our investigation",
    "are set forth in  2 .",
    "extensions and refinements are considered in  3 .",
    "lastly , in  4 , we discuss our results in the context of observations and summarize unresolved issues .",
    "we consider a t tauri star surrounded by a passive disk . the star is modeled as a spherical black body of temperature @xmath6 , mass @xmath7 , and radius @xmath8 ( see , e.g. , table ii in beckwith et al .",
    "our fiducial disk has surface mass density similar to that of the minimum - mass solar nebula , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the disk radius measured in au and @xmath11 ( weidenschilling 1977 ) .",
    "dust , which is uniformly mixed with the gas , comprises about one percent of the total mass .",
    "dust grains dominate the continuum opacity from visible through millimeter wavelengths .",
    "we take the grains to be spheres with radius @xmath12 m , mass density @xmath13 , and negligible albedo .",
    "their emissivity , which is unity for @xmath14 , decreases as @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "we denote by @xmath17 the average dust emissivity at temperature @xmath18 . for our fiducial disk , @xmath19 .",
    "the dust opacity at visual wavelengths is @xmath20 , which implies an optical depth @xmath21 for our fiducial disk .",
    "seds are computed for disks viewed pole - on .",
    "we choose an inner cutoff radius , @xmath22 , to mark the condensation boundary of common silicates . the outer cutoff radius for flat disks , @xmath23 , is fixed to facilitate comparisons among different disk models ;",
    "@xmath24 is comparable to the size of the largest disks seen in silhouette against the orion nebula ( mccaughrean & odell 1996 ) .",
    "our model assumptions are chosen to make the telling of our story as simple and direct as possible .",
    "issues regarding these choices and possible alternatives are dealt with in  3 .      to begin , we review standard relations for the temperature and sed of a blackbody disk .",
    "the flux of stellar radiation incident upon the disk is @xmath25 for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the grazing angle at which the starlight strikes the disk . equating the emitted and absorbed fluxes yields the disk temperature is used to denote effective temperature . ]",
    "@xmath28    the sed is computed as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the planck function , and @xmath31 is the distance to the source .",
    "a scaling relation for @xmath32 at wavelengths between those that characterize the disk at @xmath33 and @xmath24 is derived as follows .",
    "equation ( [ bbsed ] ) is approximated as @xmath34 , @xmath35 is replaced by @xmath36 , @xmath37 is related to @xmath38 by equation ( [ te ] ) , and @xmath38 is expressed in terms of @xmath39 by @xmath40 .",
    "these steps yield    @xmath41    in other words , the fraction of the stellar luminosity @xmath42 that is reprocessed to frequencies in an octave centered on @xmath39 is approximately equal to the grazing angle @xmath27 at the location where @xmath43 .",
    "a flat disk is one whose aspect ratio ( opening angle ) is independent of @xmath37 ; we assume it to be much less than unity .",
    "the grazing angle appropriate to this geometry is @xmath44 for @xmath45 ( kusaka , nakano , & hayashi 1970 , ruden & pollack 1991 ) .",
    "thus @xmath38 from equation ( [ te ] ) takes the form    @xmath46    application of the scaling relation given by equation ( [ sedapprox ] ) to the flat disk gives @xmath47 .",
    "figure [ bbflatfig ] confirms that @xmath32 obeys this relation for @xmath48 .",
    "we retain the assumption that the disk radiates as a blackbody and consider the consequences of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium in a gravitational field @xmath49 .",
    "this is the case investigated by kenyon & hartmann ( 1987 ) .",
    "the disk temperature @xmath38 is still given by equation ( [ te ] ) , but now the grazing angle @xmath27 takes the more general form    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the height of the visible photosphere above the disk midplane .    taking the gas to be isothermal at temperature @xmath38 yields a gaussian vertical density profile    @xmath52    where    @xmath53    the temperature @xmath54 is a measure of the gravitational potential at the surface of the central star ;    @xmath55    with @xmath56 the mean molecular weight of the gas . under the assumption that the dust to gas ratio is uniform throughout the disk , we find    @xmath57^{1/2}\\ , , \\label{h / h}\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 is the number density in the photosphere .",
    "armed with equations ( [ alpha])([h / h ] ) , we are ready to evaluate @xmath59 . in the limit of large radius where @xmath27 is dominated by the flaring term ,    @xmath60    in writing equation ( [ h / a ] ) we have set @xmath61 ; in reality , this factor declines from about 5 at @xmath62 to 4 at @xmath63 .",
    "it follows from equations ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ h / a ] ) that @xmath64 .",

    "longward of @xmath71 in the rayleigh - jeans regime , the sed varies as @xmath72 .      here",

    "variables evaluated there carry a subscript @xmath76 .",
    "we assume that in steady - state the interior gas and dust temperatures are equal ; @xmath77 .",
    "a schematic of how the stellar radiation is reprocessed is illustrated in figure [ schem ] .",
    "the radiation penetrates the disk to an optical depth of order unity along a slant path inclined by an angle @xmath27 to the surface .",
    "dust particles along the slant path are `` superheated '' to a temperature    @xmath78    which is greater than the blackbody temperature @xmath79 because their absorptivity in the visible exceeds their emissivity in the infrared .",
    "the normal optical depth of the superheated dust layer at visual wavelengths is @xmath80 .",
    "the infrared optical depth is smaller still ; @xmath81 .",
    "the superheated dust radiates equal amounts of ir radiation into the inward and outward hemispheres .",
    "the outward directed radiation is similar to that of a dilute blackbody . where the disk is opaque to blackbody radiation at    @xmath82    the inward directed radiation is thermalized at that temperature . the outer boundary of this region is denoted by @xmath83 . just outside @xmath83 ,",
    "the interior is optically thin to its own radiation but still opaque to radiation from the superheated surface ; in these regions the interior temperature is determined by thermal balance to be    @xmath84    at still greater radii , the encased material is transparent to both its own radiation and to radiation from the surface ; the internal temperature here is given by    @xmath85    the sed for the radiative equilibrium disk is computed from    @xmath86    where @xmath87 measures optical depth from @xmath88 to @xmath89 along the axis perpendicular to the disk midplane .",
    "once again we consider the flat disk , but now under conditions of radiative equilibrium .",
    "the appropriate expression for the effective temperature is given by equation ( [ tef ] ) .",
    "for our fiducial flat disk @xmath90 .",
    "runs of @xmath75 and @xmath91 as functions of @xmath37 are displayed in figure [ tprof ] .",
    "the sed for the flat , radiative equilibrium disk as calculated from equation ( [ sed ] ) is displayed in figure [ reflat ] .",
    "its appearance is similar to that of the sed for the flat blackbody disk . over most of the ir ,",
    "it is dominated by radiation from the optically thick interior .",
    "the surface layer radiates more than the interior shortward of @xmath92 ; however , there its contribution is hidden by that from the central star .",
    "most of the radiation longward of a millimeter comes from the outer , optically thin part of the disk .",
    "this accounts for the drop of the sed below the extrapolation of the @xmath93 power law .",
    "now we investigate the disk model in which both vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and radiative transfer are treated in a self - consistent fashion .",
    "the flaring geometry is governed by equations ( [ alpha ] ) through ( [ h / h ] ) . in the limit where the grazing angle is dominated by the flaring term and",
    "the disk is opaque to its thermal radiation , the expression for @xmath59 is nearly identical to that given by equation ( [ h / a ] ) . in other , more optically thin regimes , the flaring geometry changes slightly as @xmath91 takes successively different forms .    a plot of @xmath91 for the flared",

    "radiation emitted by the surface mirrors that of the interior , but is shifted towards and dominates at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the near power law rises of both disk components of the sed in the mid - infrared are readily obtained following the procedure used in the derivation of equation ( [ sedapprox ] ) .",
    "the superheated layer obeys the scaling relation @xmath104 .",
    "similarly , the opaque interior obeys @xmath105 . that the former exceeds the latter at fixed wavelength reflects the fact that compared to @xmath106 , most of the contribution to @xmath107 arises from larger radii and hence larger @xmath27 .",
    "planetary atmospheres are generally transparent to visible radiation above their uppermost clouds decks . , @xmath108 .",
    "] visible radiation is absorbed by particles .",
    "collisions maintain thermal equilibrium between gas molecules and the particles .",
    "unit optical depth in the thermal infrared is reached above the cloud tops .",
    "pressure broadened molecular lines are the main source of infrared opacity .",
    "the total infrared luminosity , the sum of absorbed sunlight and internal heat loss , is emitted as approximate black body radiation .",
    "thus the energy balance of a planetary atmosphere resembles that of the blackbody disk .",
    "this analogy probably accounts for the casual acceptance of the blackbody disk model .",
    "however compelling , this analogy is flawed .",
    "t tauri disks differ from planetary atmospheres in a crucial parameter , the vertical gravitational acceleration . for disks , @xmath109 , with @xmath110 the orbital angular velocity , and @xmath88 the distance from the midplane . for our standard parameters , @xmath111 , much smaller than @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "three consequences of the low vertical gravitational acceleration in disks which invalidate the analogy with planetary atmospheres are described below .",
    "dust grains settle slowly in disks .",
    "the gravitational settling time to the midplane ,    @xmath114    is independent of @xmath37 .",
    "it is longer than the disk lifetime for particles which most efficiently absorb stellar radiation .",
    "moreover , the settling may be slowed by turbulent mixing or vertical circulation of the gas .",
    "the gas pressure in disks is so low that dust grains which are directly exposed to stellar radiation reradiate almost all of the stellar energy they absorb .",
    "thus the temperature of the superheated grains is determined by radiative balance and is independent of the ambient gas temperature .",
    "the regulation of the gas temperature is a more subtle issue ( cf . ",
    "[ ebal ] ) .",
    "the low pressure in disks also means that molecular lines suffer negligible pressure broadening .",
    "thus the gas opacity is concentrated in narrow , doppler broadened lines .",
    "important molecular sources of opacity must have permitted dipole transitions near the peak of the blackbody spectrum corresponding to the ambient temperature @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , these transitions must connect energy levels which do not lie too far above @xmath115 .",
    "water is a prime candidate for a coolant at temperatures greater than @xmath116 .",
    "it is abundant , and as a consequence of being both a hydride and an asymmetric rotor , it possesses a rich rotation spectrum shortward of @xmath117 . however , our crude estimates suggest that even if much of the cosmic abundance of oxygen is tied up in water , water lines would not cover more than a small fraction of the infrared spectrum at any temperature .",
    "stellar energy absorbed by dust grains is lost through emission of infrared radiation and collisional transfer to gas molecules .",
    "the gas molecules , mostly h@xmath118 and he , gain energy in collisions with dust grains and lose it in collisions with molecular coolants such as h@xmath118o .",
    "the energy added to the internal degrees of freedom of the coolants in collisions with gas molecules and by absorption of dust radiation is lost in radiation to space .",
    "thus @xmath119 , where the subscripts @xmath120 denote quantities pertaining to the dust , the inert gas molecules , and the molecular coolants , respectively . refers to the excitation temperature of the coolant transition . ]",
    "balancing the rates of energy gain and loss per unit surface area of a dust grain yields    @xmath121    with @xmath122 the sound speed . for @xmath123 , where the critical number density    @xmath124    gas - grain collisions have a negligible effect on @xmath75 and equation ( [ dbal ] ) reduces to equation ( [ td ] ) . on the right hand side of equation ( [ nc1 ] ) at temperature @xmath75 . ] on the other hand , for @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "the gas density in the superheated dust layer , @xmath127 , is unknown",
    ". it could be as large as @xmath128 , the value at the disk midplane , or as low as @xmath129 , the value obtained by assuming uniform mixing of dust and gas up to the tenuous outer layers of the disk .",
    "runs of @xmath130 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 as functions of @xmath37 are displayed in figure [ nprof ] .",
    "it is seen that even @xmath128 falls below @xmath130 beyond @xmath131 .",
    "balancing the rates at which inert gas molecules gain and lose energy in collisions with dust grains and molecular coolants yields    @xmath132    where @xmath133 is a number density , and @xmath134 denotes a collisional cross - section .",
    "the compositions and mixing ratios of molecular coolants are uncertain . photodissociation and incorporation into dust grains represent loss mechanisms that can reduce abundance ratios far below values based on cosmic abundances .",
    "nevertheless , suppose that the mass in coolant molecules is comparable to that in dust grains .",
    "then @xmath135 , the ratio of the linear size of a gas molecule to a dust grain .",
    "thus we would not be surprised to discover that @xmath136 .",
    "estimating excitation temperatures for the transitions in molecular coolants is a daunting task .",
    "we proceed by making a number of drastic approximations .",
    "each transition is assumed to give rise to an optically thick , doppler broadened line having excitation temperature @xmath137 .",
    "for clarity , we begin by considering the pure radiative excitation of these levels .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the excitation comes mainly from radiation emitted by the superheated dust grains as opposed to that from the inner portion of the disk .",
    "we specialize further to transitions whose frequencies lie on the rayleigh - jeans part of the blackbody spectrum at temperature @xmath75 . applying the basic concepts of the escape probability formalism for radiative transfer to a two level molecule , we obtain    @xmath138    pure radiative excitation sets a floor on the value of @xmath137 .",
    "next we consider the effects of collisions while neglecting radiative excitation . here",
    "we suppose that lines of brightness temperature @xmath137 cover a fraction @xmath139 of the blackbody spectrum at temperature @xmath137 .",
    "we equate the emission line flux to the rate ( per unit disk surface area ) at which the gas gains energy in collisions with the superheated dust grains :    @xmath140    for @xmath141 , where the second critical gas density    @xmath142    we find    @xmath143    in the high density limit @xmath144 , @xmath145 with    @xmath146    if @xmath147 , equation ( [ onet ] ) reduces to ( [ td ] ) , the appropriate expression for the dust temperature in the absence of cooling by molecular line emission . on the other hand , if @xmath148 , ( [ onet ] ) collapses to the expression appropriate for a blackbody disk as given by equation ( [ te ] ) , magnified by a factor of about @xmath149 .",
    "we have been assuming that the dust and gas are uniformly mixed throughout the disk .",
    "consequently , for our model the gas density is much smaller in the superthermal dust layer than in the disk midplane ( cf .",
    "[ nprof ] ) .",
    "although the timescale for dust grains to settle to the disk midplane may be long compared to the disk lifetime [ cf .",
    "equation ( [ tsettle ] ) ] , the timescale for grains to fall through the superthermal layer ( in the absence of advection by the gas ) is considerably shorter .",
    "the latter is given by    @xmath150    where @xmath151 is the dust opacity in the surface layer at visual wavelengths .",
    "the timescale for dust collisions / coagulation to occur in the superthermal layer is @xmath152 times larger than @xmath153 .",
    "thus , the superthermal dust layer is likely to be found closer to the disk midplane and to have a lower @xmath154 than our simple assumption of uniform dust - gas mixing implies .    how might we learn about the level at which the superthermal dust layer sits ?",
    "one possibility is through the observation of emission lines that would form in the gas associated with this layer if the gas temperature is comparable to the dust temperature .",
    "perhaps most revealing would be observations of the rotation lines of h@xmath118 .",
    "because these arise from quadrupole transitions and are therefore weak , they would only be seen if the dust layer were located where the gas density is much larger than the minimum value given by the assumption of uniform mixing of dust and gas .      a nonzero dust grain albedo , @xmath155 , at visible wavelengths would reduce the absorbed stellar flux by a factor of order @xmath156 .",
    "this would lower the disk thickness , but by a less impressive factor of order @xmath157 .",
    "how small might @xmath156 be ? values of @xmath158 are typical of interstellar grains ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "visual albedos of pure ice particles are much closer to unity . and ices are likely to comprise a significant fraction of the mass in grains in the outer disk . starting inside @xmath63 , the partial pressures of h@xmath118o , then nh@xmath159 , and finally ch@xmath160 are expected to exceed their vapor pressures . however , taking the outer planet atmospheres as a guide , it seems unlikely that any ice so formed would be pure enough to yield @xmath161 .      a star which derives its radiant energy from accretion has @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the mass accretion rate .",
    "the stellar flux impinging on the circumstellar disk , @xmath164 , is to be compared with the local viscous dissipation rate per unit area , @xmath165 .",
    "thus in the extreme case that accretion accounts for the entire stellar luminosity , viscous dissipation is only competitive with stellar heating for @xmath166 .",
    "the bulk of the viscous dissipation probably takes place deep inside the disk .",
    "provided the disk is sufficiently opaque , this could result in midplane temperatures being higher than @xmath167 by a factor of order @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the effective vertical optical depth .",
    "a concomitant increase in the disk thickness by a factor of @xmath170 changes the surface geometry and may cause some portions of the disk to be shadowed from direct exposure to starlight .",
    "such effects are likely to be important only for the innermost regions of the disk where radiation temperatures , surface densities , and consequently optical depths are highest .",
    "for example , around an accretion powered star , the midplane temperature of our standard disk is about @xmath171 at @xmath172 .",
    "this yields about a factor 2 increase in disk thickness relative to that of the passive disk . for smaller radii ,",
    "the enhanced thickness would be buffered somewhat by the reduction of opacity associated with the vaporization of silicates .",
    "in figure [ gmaur ] , we demonstrate that the nearly flat infrared excess of the classical t tauri star gm aur can be naturally interpreted as arising from a passive reprocessing disk",
    ". parameters for the central star are obtained from beckwith et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , and a distance of 140 pc to the tau - aur cloud is assumed .",
    "approximate best fit parameters for the assumed face - on disk are the same as those of our fiducial model , with the following alterations : @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 .",
    "the inner cut - off radius is chosen so that the model matches the observationally determined sed at @xmath178 ; a smaller cut - off radius results in excessive emission .",
    "however , it seems likely that the central hole is an artifact of fitting a face - on model to observations of a disk viewed at a non - zero inclination angle , @xmath76 .",
    "millimeter - wave aperture synthesis images in co and hubble space telescope ( hst ) images in scattered stellar light reveal a flared circumstellar disk in keplerian rotation ( koerner 1997 ) , and suggest that @xmath179 .",
    "it is possible that the flared outer `` wall '' extincts emission from the inner disk , diluting the @xmath178 flux and mimicking the signature of an inner hole .",
    "we reserve a more detailed discussion of the effects of non - zero inclination angle to a future study .",
    "pioneering observations which marginally resolve disks at mm wavelengths are reported in lay et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and mundy et al .",
    "fits of elliptical gaussians to the @xmath180 brightness distributions of hl tau and l1551 irs 5 yield semi - major radii at half - maximum brightness of 60 and @xmath181 , respectively ( lay et al .",

    "interferometric observations of the nearest t tauri disks at @xmath184 with 10 milliarcsecond resolution might separate the contributions to the sed from the superthermal dust layer and the disk interior . running integrals for @xmath107 and @xmath106 against @xmath37",
    "are displayed in figure [ fluxfig ] .",
    "most of the @xmath185 emission inwards of @xmath186 originates from the disk interior , whereas the contribution from the superthermal layer is localized in an annulus centered on @xmath187 .",

    "longer than @xmath189 , the disk interior dominates the emission .",
    "dust grains possess spectral resonances . among the best - known",
    "are those at @xmath190 and @xmath191 which are thought to arise from silicates ( see , e.g. , draine 1995 ) ; the former has been observed in both emission and absorption in the spectra of t tauri stars .",
    "for example , cohen & witteborn ( 1985 ) identified @xmath185 emission features in 24 stars and @xmath185 absorption features in another @xmath192 in a spectrophotometric survey of 32 t tauri stars .",
    "the emission features evince line to continuum ratios of about 1.23.0 to 1 .",
    "emission features are a natural consequence of the superheated dust layer for disks viewed nearly face - on .",
    "line to continuum ratios should be of the same order as the percentage increase in dust emissivity associated with the spectral feature . to illustrate the effects of spectral resonances , we have employed an emissivity profile motivated by the data for `` outer - cloud dust '' as given by mathis ( 1990 ) .",
    "the resulting ( face - on ) sed displayed in figure [ specd ] exhibits emission features at 10 and @xmath188 .",
    "absorption features may be associated with disks viewed nearly edge - on .",
    "support for this hypothesis comes from two observational findings .",
    "these features appear most prominently among the `` extreme '' flat spectrum sources for which @xmath32 at infrared wavelengths matches or exceeds @xmath32 in the visible .",
    "there is a positive correlation between the strengths of these features and the fractional linear polarization at optical wavelengths .",
    "both findings are plausibly the consequence of the extinction of optical radiation in a flared disk viewed at large inclination angle .",
    "temporal variations would provide another diagnostic of circumstellar disks . of relevance here",
    "is the claim by moriarty - schieven & butner ( 1997 ) that the submillimeter and millimeter fluxes from the t tauri binary gg tau increased by factors of order 2 between 1992 and 1994 .",
    "the cause of this `` radio - wave flare '' has not been identified .",
    "a plausible hypothesis is that it resulted from enhanced disk heating associated with a burst in luminosity originating near one or both components of the central binary .",
    "this leads us to consider relevant timescales for the radiative and hydrostatic response of the disk .",
    "how rapidly might the sed vary in response to changes in the luminosity of the central star ?",
    "since @xmath203 , contributions from the surface layer are limited by @xmath204 .",

    "how high does the layer of superthermal dust grains sit above the disk midplane ? what is the gas temperature in this layer ?",
    "is gravitational settling of dust grains seriously impeded by turbulent mixing or by vertical circulation ? or does radiation pressure from the central star dominate all the forces , so that the superthermal grains are driven into denser environments and the disk geometry flattens ?",
    "we thank anneila sargent for providing the data on gm aur and other t tauri stars , shri kulkarni for suggesting that temporal variability of disk emission can provide a further means of probing disk characteristics , dave koerner and karl stapelfeldt for informative discussions regarding gm aur , and steve beckwith for a thorough and thoughtful referee s report .",
