    "the mystery of the replication of families is part of the flavor problem .",
    "but unlike the first three families , a possible fourth family may have a more easily understood role to play .",
    "fourth family fermions with masses above about 550 gev would couple strongly to the goldstone bosons of electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "this is another way of saying that these fermions are involved with the strong dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking . to put it even more strongly , these fermion masses are then the natural order parameters for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "meanwhile the fourth family may be the last sequential family and in this way complete the flavor structure of the theory .",
    "the joining of these two issues , the flavor problem and electroweak symmetry breaking , is a prime motivation to consider the fourth family .",
    "strong interactions , rather than a higgs , would unitarize @xmath7 scattering . but given some unknown strong interactions it remains to determine the massive propagating degrees of freedom that most strongly affects this scattering of goldstone bosons . for example , for the scattering of pseudo - goldstone bosons of qcd it is the @xmath8 . for most theories of electroweak symmetry breaking",
    "it is also a boson , either scalar or vector .",
    "instead we are proposing that the propagating degrees of freedom are fermions .",
    "this requires that the strong interactions break chiral symmetries without confining the massive fermions .",
    "this is reminiscent of the old njl model , which then forms the basis for a bottom up description of the effective dynamics .",
    "in fact in the absence of the higgs boson , effective four fermion interactions must also be responsible for feeding mass from the heavy fermions to lighter quarks and leptons .",
    "the size of such operators are determined by inverse powers of a new mass scale , the scale of flavor physics , which therefore can not be that far removed from the electroweak scale .",
    "thus a fourth family would not only recast the flavor problem , but it would also force us to conclude that the scale of flavor physics is nearby .",
    "we note that the main effect of a light higgs boson in electroweak precision data is to shift the value of the @xmath9 parameter by a positive amount .",
    "if there is no light higgs , then something else must produce a positive @xmath10 .",
    "but the mass splitting in the heavy quark doublet does just that . for a more detailed analysis that shows how",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath9 constraints can be satisfied through appropriate masses for the fourth family quark and leptons see @xcite .",
    "that reference also relates the @xmath4 mass to a contribution to the heavy quark mass splitting , with the implication that @xmath12 .",
    "this result is based on an analysis of the approximate symmetries of operators that may be necessary to account for the @xmath4 mass while remaining consistent with other constraints such as the @xmath13 coupling .",
    "see the appendix for a brief summary of that argument .",
    "assuming some ckm mixing between the third and fourth families , one or both of the following processes should be important .",
    "@xmath14 if @xmath15 and @xmath16 differ by more than the @xmath5 mass then certainly the heavier of @xmath0 or @xmath1 will decay into the lighter , and only one of these processes will be important .",
    "if @xmath15 and @xmath16 differ by less than the @xmath5 mass then the mass splitting and the value of the ckm mixing angles will determine the importance of transitions between @xmath0 and @xmath1 involving virtual @xmath5 s .",
    "for example if @xmath17 gev and @xmath18 gev then the rate for @xmath19 will be comparable to or dominate @xmath20 for a mixing angle @xmath21 ( .01 , .04 , .001 ) respectively . thus we see how process ( [ e2 ] ) could still be important even if we are correct about @xmath12 .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we developed a search strategy for process ( [ e1 ] ) , where we used the invariant mass of single jets to identify the hadronic decays of @xmath5 s .",
    "this method has been studied in @xcite and in cases @xcite like ours where the @xmath5 s in the signal events are both well boosted and isolated .",
    "the jet invariant mass distribution for the signal events has a strong peak close to @xmath22 for an appropriate cone size in the jet finding algorithm .",
    "a @xmath5-jet is defined to be a jet with invariant mass within @xmath23 gev of @xmath22 .",
    "it is seen in @xcite that this method is significantly less efficient at identifying the less isolated @xmath5 s of the main irreducible background , @xmath24 production .",
    "thus in comparison to a more traditional search for heavy quarks @xcite where the two jets in @xmath25 are identified , an enhancement of the signal to background ratio @xmath26 in the reconstruction the @xmath0 mass is obtained .    in the case of process ( [ e2 ] ) we shall explore the use of the jet invariant mass technique to identify both @xmath5 s and @xmath4 s @xcite through their hadronic decays . and for both processes ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) we shall consider a major background not considered in @xcite , that of qcd multijets .",
    "this background requires a more restrictive event selection .",
    "an interesting consequence of these new constraints is that they make possible an effective search without @xmath6-tagging .",
    "one measure of the background to new heavy particle production is the size of the high energy tail of the @xmath27 distribution ( scalar @xmath28 sum of everything in the event including missing energy ) .",
    "the @xmath27 tail is sensitive to initial state radiation , and thus the modeling of isr in event generators is an important factor in background estimation .",
    "for example in stand - alone pythia@xcite and in the case of @xmath24 production , the default setting has a high cutoff on the phase space of the isr ( `` power showers @xcite '' ) in order to obtain realistic @xmath28 distributions of the hardest extra jets . on the other hand realistic @xmath28 distributions of extra jets",
    "will also arise from the use of the appropriate perturbative matrix elements , either those that are beyond lowest order at tree level ( alpgen@xcite ) , and/or those that are next - to - leading - order at one - loop ( mc@nlo@xcite ) .",
    "we found @xcite that the generators mc@nlo - herwig@xcite , alpgen - herwig and alpgen - pythia were in good agreement in their results for the high @xmath27 tail . in comparison",
    "stand - alone pythia with @xmath28-ordered power showers significantly inflates the high @xmath27 tail of @xmath24 production .",
    "( stand - alone herwig produced a similar inflation . )",
    "the reason for this is that the high cutoff relaxes the relation between different contributions to @xmath27 . in particular less energy in the @xmath24 system , where the partonic cross section is larger ,",
    "can be made up by the energy of jets from isr .",
    "the improved matrix elements on the other hand more strongly constrain the relative amounts of energy in @xmath24 versus the extra jets .",
    "figure 1 : overlayed histograms show the lack of sensitivity of alpgen - pythia to pythia s modeling of initial state radiation in @xmath24 production , when compared to stand - alone pythia .",
    "the qw tune is used for both , while @xmath29 is an alpgen jet parameter .",
    "let us further compare alpgen - pythia to stand - alone pythia , where both are using the same pythia tune ( as described below ) with power showers turned off ( ` mstp(68)=0 ` ) . in fig .",
    "( 1 ) we show the @xmath27 tails for @xmath24 production , with and without initial state radiation ( ` mstp(61)=1 ` or ` 0 ` ) . the very large sensitivity to isr that is apparent in pythia",
    "is drastically reduced in alpgen - pythia .",
    "this implies that the mlm jet - parton matching scheme @xcite of alpgen is very efficient at vetoing any extraneous hard isr from pythia , beyond that implied by the improved matrix elements of alpgen . with respect to the alpgen jet parameter @xmath29 ,",
    "the slightly greater sensitivity at @xmath30 rather than @xmath31 gev arises from the @xmath32 jet sample , where the latter becomes more susceptable to pythia s handling of isr for larger @xmath29 . also by comparing the two results of alpgen - pythia that include isr we see very little sensitivity to the choice of @xmath29 , which is a further check of the jet - parton matching scheme .    from this",
    "we are encouraged to use alpgen - pythia exclusively in the estimation of background .",
    "alpgen currently does not have a user interface for new physics models , and therefore we will use madgraph@xcite - pythia exclusively for signal generation .",
    "we will use the cteq6.1 pdf consistently within alpgen - pythia and madgraph - pythia .",
    "this pdf more accurately represents the gluon structure function , which is stronger at the relevent @xmath33 than given by cteq5l .",
    "cteq6.1 is a nlo pdf , while alpgen - pythia only goes part way towards nlo .",
    "but if and when nlo matrix elements are introduced it is instructive to see the effect of this while keeping everything else the same , including the pdf . for example",
    "the cross section for the production of @xmath34 or @xmath35 ( with 600 gev masses ) increases from @xmath36 to @xmath37 pb due to the effect of the nlo matrix elements from mc@nlo .",
    "but such enhancements , the k - factors , affect both signal and background and in our previous work we found that alpgen without k - factors produced a signal to background ratio very similar to mc@nlo",
    ".    we will adopt the qw pythia tune @xcite which is basically the popular dw tune adapted to the cteq6.1 pdf ; only the ` parp(82 ) ` value is changed . for the renormalization /",
    "factorization scale we always choose @xmath38 .",
    "we note that @xmath26 has little sensitivity to this choice ; both signal and background cross sections decrease by nearly identical amounts , about 25% , when the renormalization scale is increased to @xmath39 .",
    "we use the pgs4 detector simulator @xcite with the atlas default set of parameters ( from the madgraph package ) and with trigger selections turned off .",
    "we use the cone based jet finder with a cone size of 0.6 .",
    "we replace the @xmath6 tag / mistag efficiencies in pgs4 by @xmath40 ( for @xmath41 and vanishing above ) for underlying @xmath6 s , @xmath42 s and gluons / light quarks respectively .",
    "our choices should be more appropriate given the high @xmath28 s of the @xmath6-jets .    for our study of @xmath43 in @xcite",
    "our focus was on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 backgrounds .",
    "the event selection included a lower bound @xmath44 on the @xmath27 of the event sum of the five hardest objects , which gives similar results . ] and a lower bound of @xmath45 on the @xmath28 of a @xmath6-tagged jet .",
    "we found that @xmath46 and @xmath47 worked well , and we will fix @xmath17 gev . gev .",
    "] we require one @xmath5-jet , defined by having an invariant mass within 9 gev of @xmath22 . in the @xmath0 mass reconstruction",
    "we consider all pairs of identified @xmath5 and @xmath6 jets in each event , where for all such pairs we require an `` angular '' separation @xmath48 .",
    "we also veto any event with a jet having @xmath49 and @xmath50 gev .",
    "our study here will include the qcd multijet background and to adequately suppress this the event selection needs to be tightened further .",
    "thus far we have required one @xmath5-jet , but now we must require the leptonic decay of the other @xmath5 and accept the loss of @xmath51 of the signal .",
    "the requirement for isolated leptons and/or missing energy fortunately causes an even more drastic reduction of the multijet background .",
    "we consider a loose and a tight cut .",
    "loose : : :    isolated lepton * or * missing energy in excess of 250 gev tight : : :    isolated lepton * and * missing energy in excess of 30 gev    the isolated leptons ( electron or muon ) also have @xmath52 gev .",
    "these new constraints along with the jet mass technique are together so effective that they allow us to treat the @xmath6-tagging of a jet as optional .",
    "thus our analysis will be done with and without @xmath6-tags , where in the latter case we maintain the @xmath50 gev constraint on the jet that is combined with the @xmath5-jet in the @xmath0 mass reconstruction .",
    "one motivation for eliminating the @xmath6-tag is to cover the possibility that ckm mixing is such that @xmath53 is important , where @xmath54 is a light quark .",
    "another motivation is that @xmath6-tagging , especially at high @xmath28 , may not be very efficient in the early running of the lhc .    for the @xmath2 background we have alpgen generate samples for 0 , 1 and 2 extra hard partons , using the mlm jet - parton matching scheme .",
    "the maximum jet pseudorapidity and the minimum jet separation are set to 2.5 and 0.7 respectively .",
    "we choose @xmath30 gev for the alpgen jet definition ; with this choice the @xmath55 jet sample dominates both the exclusive @xmath32 jet sample and the inclusive @xmath56 jet sample in the signal region . more precisely it dominates on the high @xmath27 tails as shown in fig .",
    "we are thus ensured that the alpgen generated matrix elements are controlling the bulk of the showering .",
    "figure 2 : overlayed histograms show the relative sizes of the jet multiplicity samples on the high @xmath27 tail , for a ) @xmath2 with @xmath30 gev ( left ) and b ) @xmath3 with @xmath57 gev ( right ) .    for the @xmath3 background we have alpgen",
    "generate the @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 jet samples , where we allow the @xmath5 to decay inclusively . here",
    "we use @xmath57 gev , and we display the relative contributions on the high @xmath27 tail in fig .",
    "we also consider the single top production process @xmath61 since it represents another irreducible background .",
    "this is also modeled in alpgen with @xmath57 for the @xmath6-jet .",
    "we shall see that this latter background small , and other backgrounds such as @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 are even more insignificant .",
    "potentially more serious is the qcd multijet background .",
    "since the cross sections are so large , it becomes nontrivial for event generators to generate sufficient integrated luminosity to make the background estimate .",
    "here alpgen again proves helpful since it allows the exclusive 2-jet sample , with its enormous cross section , to be separated out .",
    "we will like the 3-jet sample to dominate the 2-jet sample in the signal region , and this occurs if @xmath29 is not too large . on the other hand",
    "by increasing @xmath29 we can reduce the cross sections , with the reductions proportionally greater for the higher jet multiplicities .",
    "a compromise is to take @xmath66 gev .",
    "this is small enough so that the jets in the 2-jet sample satisfying the @xmath44 cut are mostly back - to - back so that their combined invariant mass is typically much larger than @xmath16 , thus removing them from the signal region .",
    "also this value of @xmath29 is large enough so that the 4-jet sample , the inclusive sample , is smaller than the 3-jet sample in the signal region .",
    "the exclusive 2-jet contribution still has an enormous cross section , and so to explore its effect we temporarily drop the lepton / missing energy requirements and the @xmath6-tagging .",
    "we still require a jet with @xmath67 to form an invariant mass when combined with a @xmath5-jet ; then we can compare the 2-jet with the sum of the 3-jet and 4-jet samples in the signal region of the @xmath0 reconstruction plot .",
    "it is easier to generate sufficient events under these conditions and we find that the 2-jet sample is roughly 1/2 as large .",
    "thus we can concentrate on generating sufficient integrated luminosity of the 3 and 4-jet samples with leptons / missing energy/@xmath6-tagging constraints reinstated , and ignore the 2-jet sample , with the knowledge that the 2-jet sample contributes no more than another 50% .",
    "this possible additional 50% is certainly an overestimate , since the likelihood of mis - identified leptons or fake missing energy will be less for the 2-jet sample than for the higher multiplicity samples .",
    "in fact for the ( small ) integrated luminosity that we have generated for the 2-jet sample , none of the events survive on the @xmath0 mass reconstruction plots . on the plots to follow",
    "we do not make any correction for the neglected 2-jet sample .",
    "we show the signal and the various backgrounds as stacked histograms on the @xmath0 mass reconstruction plots in fig .",
    "( 3 ) , where the two plots are for the loose and tight lepton / missing energy constraints .",
    "we see the successful suppression of the multijet background to almost insignificant levels . without the lepton / missing energy constraints , the multijet background would be several times higher than the height of the signal peak .",
    "we also note that the fall - off of the backgrounds for large invariant mass @xmath68 is controlled by our constraint on @xmath69 .",
    "figure 3 : the signal from @xmath70 compared to various backgrounds with @xmath6-tagging , where the loose and tight cuts refer to the isolated lepton and/or missing energy requirements .",
    "the various contributions , including the signal , have been stacked ( not overlayed ) .",
    "this strength of signal to background encourages us to consider results without the @xmath6-tag , as shown in fig .",
    "the multijet background remains small while the @xmath3 background becomes substantially more important .",
    "nevertheless we see that the discovery potential for the heavy quarks is still quite attractive without @xmath6-tagging , thus providing an opportunity in the early running of the lhc before @xmath6-tagging methods are well developed .",
    "figure 4 : the same as the previous figure , without @xmath6-tagging .",
    "if @xmath1 is larger than the @xmath0 mass by more than the @xmath5 mass , then the following process will occur .",
    "@xmath71 this basically increases the signal discussed in the last section .",
    "two of the @xmath5 s will be relatively soft since the heavy quark mass splitting can not be too large .",
    "the leptonic decays of these @xmath5 s will add to the likelihood of observing isolated leptons , thus enhancing this contribution to the signal .",
    "for @xmath72 and @xmath17 gev we find that @xmath35 production has a cross section about 40% that of @xmath34 production .",
    "we compare the two contributions to the signal in fig .",
    "( 5 ) .",
    "figure 5 : the signal appearing in figure ( 4 ) is shown in isolation , along with the additional signal that would arise from @xmath35 production when @xmath72 gev .    we now consider the process of interest if @xmath19 is the dominant decay mode of @xmath1 : @xmath73 here we set @xmath74 gev . if @xmath16 is sufficiently larger than @xmath15 then this signal is enhanced further through @xmath75 ( and the signal of the last section disappears ) but we will ignore this in the following . our object will be to explore the feasibility of using single jet invariant masses to identify both the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 through their hadronic decays , and from them reconstruct the @xmath1 mass .",
    "a drawback is that the cone size that is optimal to identify @xmath5 jets is not optimal to identify the @xmath4 jet , since a significantly larger cone size is necessary to capture the three proto - jets of a boosted @xmath4 decay.s from the decay of vector - like quarks more massive than ours , so that the @xmath4 s were more strongly boosted . ]",
    "our compromise , not optimal for either identification , is the choice of 0.8 for the cone size .",
    "a @xmath5-jet is defined by an invariant mass within 9 gev of @xmath22 as before . for the @xmath4",
    "the associated invariant mass peak in the signal events is broad and not nearly as strong as the @xmath5 peak .",
    "thus we make a loose definition of a @xmath4-jet as a jet with invariant mass greater than 100 gev and @xmath76 gev .",
    "we use the same loose and tight lepton / missing energy constraints as described before . the only other difference is to tighten the upper bound on @xmath77 between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 jets to 2.0 .    for the qcd jet background we use alpgen to generate the 2 , 3 , and 4-jet samples as before .",
    "again none of the 2-jet sample actually generated survives as background to the @xmath1-mass reconstruction .",
    "we can also bound the possible contribution of a 2-jet sample as before by removing the lepton / missing energy requirements , in which case the 2-jet sample is about 1/4 the size of the @xmath78-jet sample in the signal region .",
    "once again we make no correction for dropping the 2-jet sample .",
    "using this event selection we produce the results for the @xmath1 mass reconstruction in fig .",
    "although the signal size is hampered as we have described , we note that the background reduction appears again to be very effective . and",
    "it is again of interest to note that our use of the jet mass technique has made possible a search for @xmath1 without the use of @xmath6-tags .",
    "figure 6 : the signal from @xmath79 compared to various backgrounds using the jet mass technique to identify both @xmath5 s and @xmath4 s .",
    "we believe that our search strategy for new heavy quarks at the lhc improves on the more traditional analysis modeled after the @xmath4 quark discovery at fermilab .",
    "a key role is played by the jet mass technique to identify @xmath5 s ( and @xmath4 s ) through their hadronic decays , which in the case of @xmath34 production acts to suppress the main irreducible background from @xmath24 production .",
    "we have found that among the various background processes , only the qcd multijet background forces requirements for isolated leptons and/or missing energy . but with these requirements the search for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be undertaken without the use of @xmath6-tagging .    for the actual estimation of backgrounds",
    "we have found alpgen - pythia to be useful , both to avoid the excessive sensitivity of stand - alone pythia to the modeling of initial state radiation , and in the estimation of the multijet background .",
    "it is possible that our use of the fast detector simulator pgs4 could be leading to an overly optimistic estimate of the background reduction .",
    "a full detector simulation is certainly warranted , especially with regard to the efficiency of isolated lepton and missing energy constraints on event selection .",
    "nevertheless the strong signal to background results that we have exhibited provides reason to believe that fourth family quarks could be discovered in the early running of the lhc .",
    "a serious issue for a model of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking is the generation of the large @xmath4 mass in a manner compatible with electroweak precision measurements .",
    "we briefly summarize an argument @xcite based on approximate symmetries of effective operators that suggests a way out .",
    "since we are interested in approximate symmetries that can constrain operators that generate mass and/or feed down mass , the approximate symmetries should be axial - like . for the third and fourth family quarks @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    ", there are two such axial - charge generators to consider : @xmath83 : @xmath84 and @xmath85 : @xmath86 .",
    "we then categorize some effective operators of interest in terms of the charges they carry , where all may be written in an @xmath87 invariant manner .",
    "* @xmath88 ( neutral under both charges ) * @xmath89 ( charged under @xmath83 ) * @xmath90 ( charged under @xmath85 )    operators of type 1 and 2 are such that they can be generated by gauge boson exchange , while the type 3 operators with their @xmath91 structure can not be .",
    "type 1 operators represent the dynamics generating mass for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 while type 2 and 3 operators can feed mass from the fourth family to the third family quarks .",
    "type 2 operators are usually considered for this task .",
    "the trouble is that this set of operators includes other operators that are dangerous , in particular those that contribute to the @xmath9 parameter and the @xmath13 vertex .",
    "in particular it is nontrivial to arrange gauge boson exchanges to generate the @xmath4 mass while not also generating unwanted effects @xcite .",
    "type 2 operators are all suppressed if @xmath83 corresponds to a good approximate symmetry .",
    "if @xmath85 is more badly broken than @xmath83 then the @xmath4 mass can instead arise from an operator of type 3 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath92 as the @xmath4-mass operator .",
    "the @xmath6-mass on the other hand can come either from the accompanying operator in class 3 ( related by a @xmath93 transformation of the @xmath4-mass operator ) or from an operator of the suppressed class 2 . in either case we see that the nonperturbative dynamics responsible for type 3 operators must badly break @xmath93 .",
    "figure 7 : effects arising from two insertions of the @xmath4-mass operator .",
    "the mere existence of the @xmath4-mass operator ( its partner @xmath94 by @xmath95 symmetry is implicit ) implies that some operators of class 2 will be generated .",
    "but since class 2 operators are @xmath85 invariant , two insertions of the @xmath4-mass operator are necessary .",
    "the resulting effects are thus suppressed by @xmath96 and a loop factor .",
    "one example is the @xmath13 vertex correction in fig .",
    "another is the correction to the @xmath1 mass in fig .",
    "( 7b ) , which is not shared by the @xmath0 mass .",
    "this is the origin of the expectation that @xmath12 .",

    "<S> we explore further the discovery potential for heavy quarks at the lhc , with emphasis on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 of a sequential fourth family associated with electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we consider qcd multijets , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and single @xmath4 backgrounds using event generation based on improved matrix elements and low sensitivity to the modeling of initial state radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit a jet mass technique for the identification of hadronically decaying @xmath5 s and @xmath4 s , to be used in the reconstruction of the @xmath0 or @xmath1 mass . </S>",
    "<S> this along with other aspects of event selection can reduce backgrounds to very manageable levels . </S>",
    "<S> it even allows a search for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the absence of @xmath6-tagging , of interest for the early running of the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> a heavy quark mass of order 600 gev is motivated by the connection to electroweak symmetry breaking , but our analysis is relevant for any new heavy quarks with weak decay modes . </S>"
