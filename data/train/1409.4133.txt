    "this paper continues the analysis of arbitrary highest weight modules over a complex semisimple lie algebra @xmath5 , which was initiated in @xcite .",
    "highest weight modules are fundamental in the study of lie algebras and representation theory .",
    "classically , they are crucial in studying the ( parabolic ) bernstein - gelfand - gelfand category @xmath6 , primitive ideals of @xmath7 , quantum groups and crystals ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , highest weight modules and certain distinguished subsets of their weights have gained renewed attention for several reasons , including the study of kirillov  reshetikhin modules over quantum affine lie algebras , abelian ideals , categorification , weight multiplicities , and the combinatorics of root and ( pseudo-)weyl polytopes .",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite , and the references therein and also in @xcite . )",
    "yet while certain special families such as ( parabolic ) verma modules and their finite - dimensional quotients are well - understood ( but not fully so ) , the same is not true of arbitrary highest weight modules .",
    "the goal of the present paper  as of previous work @xcite  is to improve our understanding of general highest weight modules @xmath8 .",
    "( all notation is explained in section [ s2 ] . ) in @xcite , the notion of the weyl polytope was extended , from finite - dimensional simple modules to general highest weight modules .",
    "more precisely , we showed that for a large class of highest weight modules @xmath8 with highest weight @xmath9 , the convex hull of the weights is a convex polyhedron that is invariant under a distinguished parabolic subgroup of the weyl group .",
    "moreover , for certain highest weight modules @xmath8  including all simple highest weight modules @xmath10 for @xmath11  we computed the set of weights , in three different ways .    a question that has been studied in detail in the literature by satake , borel ",
    "tits , vinberg , casselman , cellini  marietti , and others ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.4 ) ) , involves analyzing inclusion relations between pairs of faces of the aforementioned polyhedron for finite - dimensional highest weight modules , i.e. , for the family of weyl polytopes .",
    "however , the redundancies in this analysis have not been fully classified .",
    "similar results for general highest weight modules remain even more elusive . in the first main result of this paper ( see theorem [ t5 ] in section [ s3 ] ) , we show that to each `` standard parabolic face '' correspond certain unique minimum and maximum sets of simple roots .",
    "moreover , we provide closed - form expressions for these extremal subsets of simple roots , in the process completely classifying the aforementioned redundancies , for arbitrary highest weight modules .    note that neither the existence of these extremal subsets of roots , nor closed - form formulas for them , were known even for the thoroughly studied and well - understood family of simple , finite - dimensional @xmath5-modules , excepting the adjoint representation . in contrast , our formulas hold for arbitrary highest weight modules and arbitrary faces , and are type - free .",
    "moreover , these formulas can be deduced directly from the root data of the dynkin diagram of @xmath5 and the set of `` integrable simple roots '' for the highest weight module . in particular",
    ", the present paper completely resolves , for all modules @xmath8 , the aforementioned problem studied by vinberg @xcite and others for finite - dimensional @xmath8 .",
    "we also extend recent work @xcite , which discussed the adjoint representation for simple @xmath5 .",
    "another goal is to compute convexity - theoretic quantities related to highest weight modules .",
    "for instance , it is natural to ask what is the dimension , or the stabilizer subgroup in the weyl group , of a given face of the convex hull of the set of weights .",
    "moreover , if this hull is a convex polyhedron , is it possible to compute its @xmath4-polynomial , or a minimal half - space representation ?",
    "once again , the answers are not known in the literature except for the adjoint representation for simple @xmath5 .",
    "our second objective in this paper is to answer all of these questions for general highest weight modules @xmath8 .",
    "we show in this paper that not only weyl polytopes / finite - dimensional simple modules , but in fact all highest weight modules over semisimple @xmath5 , are amenable to detailed analysis via representation theory and convex analysis .",
    "see theorem [ tfinite ] in section [ s3 ] for more details .",
    "a related motivation involves the recent interesting work @xcite of cellini and marietti . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the combinatorics of irreducible root systems in great detail , and established several interesting properties of the root polytope in terms of the corresponding affine root system .",
    "( recall that the root polytope is defined for a simple lie algebra @xmath5 as the convex hull of the set of roots , and it coincides with the weyl polytope for the highest root . )",
    "it is natural to ask if the results in @xcite are specific manifestations of broader phenomena that hold for all weyl polytopes , or even for the convex hulls of weights of arbitrary highest weight modules @xmath8 ( which naturally extend the notion of the weyl polytope , by results in @xcite ) .",
    "formulating and proving such results would result in a deeper understanding of weyl polytopes , finite - dimensional @xmath5-modules , and more .",
    "however , we were unable to find such results in the literature other than for the adjoint representation for simple @xmath5 ( in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the situation for semisimple @xmath5 and general @xmath12 is far more involved than that for simple @xmath5 and the adjoint representation , or even for finite - dimensional modules .",
    "there are various technical reasons why the case of general @xmath8 is much harder , as we explain below ( see remark [ rminmax ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the present paper completely settles many of the questions addressed in @xcite , by proving them for every module @xmath8 .",
    "a special case of our main theorems is that cellini ",
    "marietti s results hold with the exact same formulas , for all finite - dimensional @xmath8 with @xmath13 having the same support as the affine root of ( simple ) @xmath3 .",
    "thus we immediately obtain hitherto unknown results about a large family of weyl polytopes , with proofs coming from representation theory as opposed to the combinatorics of root systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s2 ] reviews basic notation as well as previous results in the literature , which lead to several natural and motivating questions .",
    "we then present our three main results in section [ s3 ] .",
    "each of the following three sections is devoted to proving one of these main theorems .",
    "these results discuss inclusion relations between standard parabolic subsets of weights of highest weight modules , as well as computing dimensions of affine hulls , stabilizers in parabolic weyl subgroups , @xmath4-polynomials , and minimal half - space representations in arbitrary highest weight @xmath5-modules . in section [ s7 ] , we show that the long roots , as well as the highest and lowest roots among them , which are standard notions in the adjoint representation , have natural analogues in compact standard parabolic faces of all highest weight modules . finally in section",
    "[ scellini ] , we provide a dictionary to explain how our work specializes to the results in recent work @xcite on the root polytope for a simple lie algebra , in terms of the corresponding affine root system .",
    "we further show how the results in @xcite in fact hold for a large family of weyl polytopes .",
    "we begin by setting some notation . given an @xmath14-vector space @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , define : ( a ) @xmath18 , ( b ) @xmath19 to be the minkowski sum and difference of @xmath20 , ( c ) @xmath21 to denote the convex hull of @xmath22 ; and",
    "( d ) let @xmath23 denote the set of all finite @xmath14-linear combinations of elements of @xmath22 with coefficients in @xmath24 .",
    "fix a complex semisimple lie algebra @xmath5 as well as a triangular decomposition @xmath25 .",
    "let the corresponding root system be @xmath26 .",
    "corresponding to @xmath27 , fix distinguished @xmath28-bases of simple roots @xmath29 and the associated fundamental weights @xmath30 , both indexed by @xmath31 . for any @xmath32 , define @xmath33 , and @xmath34 similarly .",
    "let @xmath35 be the real form of @xmath36 ; then @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , @xmath36 has a standard partial order via : @xmath38 if @xmath39 .",
    "next , define @xmath40 to be the weight and root lattices in @xmath41 respectively , and @xmath42    thus , @xmath43 is the set of dominant integral weights .",
    "let @xmath44 be the positive definite symmetric bilinear form on @xmath41 induced by the restriction of the killing form on @xmath5 to @xmath45 . then @xmath46 . also define @xmath47 to be the unique element of @xmath48 identified with @xmath49 via the killing form .",
    "the elements @xmath47 form an @xmath14-basis of @xmath50 .",
    "fix a set of chevalley generators @xmath51 such that @xmath52 = \\delta_{ij } h_i$ ] for all @xmath53 . also extend @xmath44 to all of @xmath36 .",
    "finally , the weyl group is the finite subgroup @xmath54 generated by the simple reflections @xmath55 , where @xmath56 sends a weight @xmath11 to @xmath57 .",
    "now define @xmath58 to be the subgroup of @xmath59 generated by @xmath60 , with unique longest element @xmath61 .",
    "we now discuss various distinguished highest weight modules . given @xmath11 , define @xmath62 to be the verma module with highest weight @xmath13 , and @xmath10 to be its unique simple quotient .",
    "thus @xmath63 .",
    "a highest weight module is a quotient of some verma module , and is usually denoted in this paper by @xmath64 .",
    "note that @xmath8 is finite - dimensional if and only if @xmath65 is dominant integral and @xmath66 is simple . in this case",

    "the following definition introduces the principal objects of study in the paper . as we presently discuss ,",
    "these objects have been studied in the literature for finite - dimensional @xmath5-modules , most intensively for the adjoint representation .",
    "given @xmath11 and @xmath82 , a _",
    "standard parabolic ( sub)set of weights of @xmath83 _ is @xmath84 for some @xmath32 ; and a _ standard parabolic face _ is @xmath85 .",
    "we now recall previous work involving standard parabolic subsets and faces for various classes of highest weight modules @xmath86 . to our knowledge , these results were previously known for parabolic verma modules , but not for other highest weight modules .",
    "the first result establishes integrability for a unique distinguished subset of simple roots , for arbitrary modules @xmath8 .",

    "moreover , if @xmath90 is spanned by @xmath91 , then @xmath92    in particular , if @xmath8 is a parabolic verma module @xmath93 for @xmath94 , or a simple module @xmath10 , then @xmath95 or @xmath96 respectively .",
    "the subset @xmath97 is ubiquitous and crucially used throughout the remainder of the paper .",
    "the next result establishes for a large class of highest weight modules @xmath8 that the convex hull of the set of weights is a polyhedron .",

    "also note that @xmath830 preserves the half - space @xmath831 as well as its boundary , since @xmath752 is contained in the boundary .",
    "it follows that the above intersection remains unchanged even if it runs only over @xmath832 .",
    "now since it is also known that @xmath104 is a convex polyhedron , it equals its minimal half - space representation , i.e. , the intersection of the half - spaces @xmath833 corresponding to the codimension - one facets of @xmath104 .",
    "note here that the codimension of the faces of @xmath104 is computed inside its affine hull , which is @xmath834 by theorem [ tfinite](1 ) . by theorem [ t23 ] for @xmath835 ,",
    "the codimension - one faces of @xmath104 correspond to @xmath212 ( and any @xmath593 ) such that the supporting hyperplane of @xmath831 , which is the affine hull of @xmath836 , has codimension one . by proposition [ pfacet ] , this condition is equivalent to : @xmath837 , and @xmath838 .",
    "thus the second part of the assertion is proved , and hence the first part as well .",
    "in this section we present additional results on minimum elements in `` compact '' faces ( i.e. , ones containing only finitely many weights ) of @xmath104 .",
    "we also show that there is a natural analogue in any highest weight module @xmath8 , of the long roots in the adjoint representation .",
    "the following result characterizes the standard parabolic subsets of highest weight modules that contain minimal elements , and also identifies these elements as well as the longest weights .",

    "therefore it has a minimum element @xmath840 , which is unique by lowest weight theory .",
    "hence ( 1)(4 ) are equivalent .",
    "finally , note that every standard parabolic subset @xmath89 always contains the unique maximum element @xmath13 .",
    "now if @xmath32 is such that @xmath85 is a convex , compact polytope , the norm function attains its maximum value on this polytope .",
    "it is easy to verify that the norm can not be maximized at an interior point of a line segment .",
    "therefore the maximum value is attained at a vertex , i.e. , at a point in @xmath846 ( by proposition [ p11 ] ) . the proof is completed by recalling that @xmath847 acts on @xmath36 by isometries .",

    "@xmath911 and @xmath912 are empty for all @xmath909 , whence @xmath913 . therefore using equation and the above analysis for @xmath894 , @xmath914",
    "the dictionary of proposition [ pcellini ] immediately helps translate the results in this paper , in the special case @xmath232 and @xmath915 , into many results in @xcite . in particular , it follows that most of the results in sections 1 , 3 , 4 , and 5 of @xcite are specific manifestations of representation - theoretic phenomena that occur for all highest weight modules over all semisimple lie algebras .",
    "moreover , in @xcite the authors worked with the root system  i.e. , the adjoint representation  and hence were able to prove their results using purely combinatorial arguments . in contrast , because we work with arbitrary highest weight modules , the present paper provides an alternative , representation - theoretic approach to proving the results in @xcite for @xmath858 .",
    "a further addition to the dictionary of proposition [ pcellini ] involves observing that many of the results in @xcite are stated in terms of the affine root @xmath900 and the affine root system @xmath916 corresponding to the simple lie algebra @xmath5 . as noted above ,",
    "@xmath900 is simply the negative of the highest root @xmath161 of @xmath5 , i.e. , the highest weight of the adjoint representation .",

    "for instance , the size of the set @xmath918 is a computation specific to the root system and is expressed in terms of other root systems ; see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.1(1 ) ) .",
    "however , there are other statements that are specific to the adjoint representation and yet can be obtained from our results in previous sections via proposition [ pcellini ] .",
    "we now provide an alternate proof of one such statement from @xcite .",
    "[ ccellini ] suppose @xmath5 is simple with highest root @xmath161 , @xmath919 , and @xmath920 .",

    "[ rcellini ] we make two further observations related to the recent paper @xcite .",

    "* remark 4.6 ) .",
    "next , for completeness we recall an interesting result shown recently by cellini and marietti for the adjoint representation of a simple lie algebra .",
    "namely , the authors show in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.2 ) that no standard parabolic subset of @xmath112 is the union of two nontrivial orthogonal subsets .",
    "it is natural to ask if this result holds for other highest weight modules .",
    "however , this is not the case ; in fact the result fails to hold even if @xmath5 is simple and @xmath8 is finite - dimensional .",
    "for example , when @xmath5 is of type @xmath930 and @xmath931 , the highest short root , the ( nonzero ) weights of @xmath932 comprise a root system of type @xmath933 , hence can be partitioned into two nontrivial orthogonal subsets .",

    "then ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 1.2 , 1.3 ) hold for @xmath937 , with the exact same formulas .",
    "one can similarly show that many of the other results in @xcite also go through completely unchanged for @xmath937 , if @xmath13 and @xmath161 have the same support among the fundamental weights @xmath938 .",
    "the result follows from theorem [ tfinite ] , lemma [ lfinite ] , proposition [ pcellini ] , and corollary [ ccellini ] if we show that equation holds for all @xmath32 , for the simple finite - dimensional module @xmath66 .",
    "but this is clear by theorem [ t5 ] : the formulas in equations and for @xmath158 only depend on @xmath939 as well as @xmath2 and @xmath940 .      since the present paper was submitted , the work @xcite by li ",
    "li has subsequently appeared . in it ,",
    "the authors have independently extended cellini ",

    "* there exists a bijection between the distinct elements in the multiset@xmath950 and the connected sub - diagrams of the extended coxeter diagram on @xmath951 that contain the node @xmath942 .",

    "each face @xmath952 has affine hull @xmath953 , which is spanned by roots .",
    "moreover , @xmath954 . * given @xmath270 , @xmath955 if and only if @xmath956 , or equivalently , if @xmath957 .",
    "* the barycenter of the face @xmath952 is a nonnegative rational linear combination of the fundamental weights in @xmath34 . *",

    "note that when @xmath232 is the highest root of @xmath5 , the corresponding extended coxeter diagram on @xmath959 is precisely ( the simple graph underlying ) the affine dynkin diagram corresponding to @xmath5 , and in this situation the above results were shown in @xcite .",
    "similarly , the case where @xmath80 has the same support as @xmath161 was previously worked out in proposition [ pcm ] . for other @xmath80 , the results in @xcite are formulated along the lines of those in @xcite , and extend many of the results in @xcite .",
    "we now explain why for all @xmath80 , the results shown in @xcite also follow from the above analysis in the present paper , if the same dictionary as in proposition [ pcellini ] is used . to do so , one first needs to define the analogue of the set @xmath893 of simple roots in @xcite , which the authors do not define for general @xmath960 in @xcite .",
    "thus , we define ( via definition [ dminmax](5 ) ) @xmath961    now observe that proposition [ pcellini ] ( with the new definitions of @xmath894 and @xmath893 ) holds for @xmath66 for all @xmath80 , with the proof essentially unchanged .",
