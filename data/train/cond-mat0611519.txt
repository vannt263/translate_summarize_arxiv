    "new device concepts based on nonequilibrium effects in superconducting mesoscopic tunnel structures have been proposed in the last few years .",
    "these include josephson transistors , electron refrigerators and thermometers.@xcite in josephson transistors the supercurrent flowing through a superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( sns ) weak link can be suppressed or even reversed in a @xmath1-transition@xcite by driving the normal metal part out of equilibrium through injection of charge carriers from additional terminals . when the additional terminals are superconductors connected by tunnel junctions , the supercurrent can also be enhanced.@xcite this transistorlike operation with large current and power gain has also been experimentally demonstrated.@xcite also an all - superconducting sisis transistor in the quasiequilibrium regime has been theoretically addressed.@xcite in the quasiequilibrium limit the electron - phonon interaction is nearly absent and the sample can be considered as detached from the phonon bath .",
    "the high frequency of electron - electron collisions still serves as a method of relaxation and the electrons assume a fermi distribution but with a temperature that in general differs from the temperature of the phonon bath .",
    "here we study a similar sisis structure with arbitrary strength of the inelastic scattering seeking ways to characterize the degree of nonequilibrium on the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the model of the sisis structure is presented in sec .  2 .",
    "all the relevant equations and calculated results are presented in secs .  3 and 4 , respectively .",

    "we characterize the mean free path that the electron travels before scattering by scattering lengths @xmath2 for elastic scattering and @xmath3 and @xmath4 for inelastic electron - phonon and electron - electron scattering , respectively . in mesoscopic systems",
    "typical orders of magnitude are @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the electron - phonon scattering length depends strongly on temperature . for a typical copper wire @xmath7 at 1 k but at 100 mk we already have @xmath8.@xcite in other metals",
    "these length scales are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the superconducting island in the middle is assumed to have small dimensions so that @xmath9 , leading to weak energy relaxation via inelastic scattering . as we shall see in the following , in this case it is possible to drive the electron energy distribution of the island out of equilibrium by quasiparticle injection from the superconducting leads .",
    "the degree of nonequilibrium on the island can then be probed for instance by measuring the supercurrent driven through the island via an additional sisis line .",
    "the leads are assumed to remain in thermal equilibrium due to their large dimensions .",
    "we further assume that the resistances of the tunnel contacts are large compared to the normal state resistance of the superconducting island .",
    "this allows us to use the tunnel hamiltonian approach , in which each region has spatially constant , separate energy distributions , independent of the directions of the momenta .    , which controls the energy distribution on the island .",

    "we use the quasiclassical keldysh green function formalism together with the tunnel hamiltonian model in describing our system .",
    "it has previously been successfully applied to hybrid structures with normal metal and superconducting islands.@xcite the quasiclassical green functions in nambu space can be written in a matrix form as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is either retarded ( advanced ) , @xmath14 , or keldysh , @xmath15 , green s function . in the tunnel hamiltonian model",

    "energy relaxation is strongest for excitations at @xmath69 due to sharp peaks at the edge of the gap in these same terms .",
    "we begin by presenting the calculated distribution function along with the order parameter and electric currents for the simplest , namely left - right symmetric case , where the tunnel junction resistances are the same and reservoirs 1 and 3 are similar superconductors , i.e. , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . when the structure is biased with a voltage @xmath72 , the conservation of electric current forces the chemical potentials of reservoirs 1 and 3 to @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "the solution of the kinetic equations and in the absence of energy relaxation ( @xmath75 ) may be written in terms of the full distribution functions as @xmath76 this form is remarkably simple due to the symmetry of the problem , and it can also be derived by considering the conservation of electric current.@xcite the distribution function is plotted in fig .",

    "once voltage reaches @xmath86 only the smallest solution , namely @xmath87 , is possible .",
    "this is due to the fact that the order parameter can never exceed its zero - temperature value .",
    "the multivalued behavior of the order parameter can be interpreted as different minima and maxima in the free energy.@xcite in this case the largest and smallest values represent minima and the middle value represents a maximum .",
