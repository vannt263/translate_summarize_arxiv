    "recent work ( bernardi et al . 2010b ) has shown that the color - magnitude relation of early - type galaxies in the sdss differs significantly from a pure power - law , curving downwards at low and upwards at large luminosities ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ) .",
    "this is also true of the color - size relation , and is even more apparent with stellar mass , where the corresponding mass scales are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the upwards curvature at the massive end does not appear to be due to stellar population effects .",
    "curvature in the color - luminosity ( or color-@xmath2 ) relation at the faint end was noticed before ( e.g. graham 2008 ; skelton et al .",
    "2009 ) ; the curvature at bright end is the new finding of bernardi et al .",
    "( 2010b ) .",
    "curvature at the low mass end using other parameters ( e.g. surface brightness ) has been noticed before as well ( e.g. kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ; shankar et al . 2006 ) ; the subject of this letter is to analyse non - linear scaling relations at the high mass end , extending the analysis of hyde & bernardi ( 2009 ) .",
    "we show that the curvature in the color@xmath10 relation coincides with curvature in other relations with @xmath2 . however , when @xmath2 is replaced with velocity dispersion , then there is little curvature .",
    "although curvature in scaling relations does not imply a change in the physics which sets the relations ( e.g. graham & guzman 2003 ; graham 2010 ) , we argue that our findings suggest that major dry mergers dominate the mass growth at @xmath9 .",
    "our results are based on two different ways of selecting early - type samples from the sdss database .",
    "one follows hyde & bernardi ( 2009 ) : the image must be round ( @xmath11 ) and the light profile shape must be well - fit by a devaucoleurs profile ( @xmath12 ) . the other is a simple cut on how centrally concentrated the surface brightness is ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the former method produces a sample that is more purely elliptical ; the latter contains many edge - on disks .",
    "see bernardi et al .",
    "( 2010a ) for a more detailed discussion of these selection criteria , and of the sdss photometric and spectroscopic parameters which we use below .",
    "where necessary , we have assumed a spatially flat background cosmology with energy density dominated by a cosmological constant @xmath14 , with a hubble constant @xmath15 at the present time .",
    "figure  [ breaks ] shows correlations between stellar mass and ( from top to bottom , left ) size , velocity dispersion and surface brightness , and color , axis ratio , and color gradient ( top to bottom , right ) , in the hyde - bernardi sample .",
    "( we discuss how we define the gradient in section  [ sec|grad ] . ) none of these correlations are pure power laws .",
    "although the curvature at @xmath16 is interesting  galaxies at the faint , low mass end ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) tend to curve towards bluer colors , larger sizes , fainter surface brightnesses , smaller axis ratios and color gradients  in what follows , we will focus on what appears to be a transition mass scale at higher masses . at @xmath19 , the relations curve towards larger sizes , smaller than expected velocity dispersions , fainter surface brightnesses ( left panels ) , and smaller axis ratios and smaller color - gradients ( right panels ) .",
    "this is precisely the mass scale on which the color-@xmath2 relation curves towards redder colors ( top right panel ) .",
    "figure  [ breakss ] shows that when @xmath2 is replaced with velocity dispersion , then there is little curvature at @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , the correlations with surface brightness , color gradient and axis ratio are almost completely flat .",
    "( that surface brightness and @xmath3 are uncorrelated was noted by bernardi et al .",
    "the fact that there is no feature at the largest @xmath3 in any of these relations , despite clear features in the scalings with @xmath2 , is what has motivated this letter .    in this context , it is important to note that the relation between @xmath21 and luminosity or @xmath2 is very well described by a single power - law over the entire range : the curvature in the sizes and velocity dispersions cancel ( figure  [ breaksmd ] ) .",
    "presumably , this is because the objects we observe are virialized , whatever their merger histories .",
    "major dissipationless mergers are expected to change the sizes in proportion to the masses , but to leave the velocity dispersions and colors unchanged .",
    "in contrast , minor dissipationless mergers produce larger fractional changes in size than in mass , and decrease the velocity dispersions and colors ( see appendix  c in bernardi et al .",
    "2010b for details ) .",
    "therefore , the curvature in the correlations between @xmath2 and other parameters as size , @xmath3 and color , which have been noticed before , have all been discussed in this context ( e.g. davies et al .",
    "1983 ; matkovic & guzman 2005 ; bernardi et al . 2007 ; hyde & bernardi 2009 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2010a , b ) .",
    "what is new here is the recognition that these all occur at the same mass scale , that this mass scale is also important for axis - ratios and color - gradients , and , significantly , that the curvature is absent when @xmath2 is replaced by @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath22 relation ( right center panel of figure  [ breaks ] ) deserves further comment .",
    "van der wel et al . (",
    "2009 ) report that the width of the @xmath5 distribution changes at @xmath23 .",
    "they interpret this as evidence that , above this mass , assembly histories are dominated by major mergers .",
    "our results suggest this is not the full story",
    ".    in figure  [ breaks ] we have shown two versions of this relation , because the hyde - bernardi selection requires @xmath11 . in this sample , @xmath5 decreases at @xmath24 .",
    "however , notice that this decrease is even more marked in the sample selected to have @xmath25 , where no cut on @xmath5 is applied .",
    "compared to the hyde - bernardi sample , this sample has considerably smaller @xmath5 at small @xmath2 .",
    "bernardi et al .",
    "( 2010a ) show that this is primarily due to an increased incidence of disks and contamination by sas , because the @xmath25 sample is not as purely elliptical / early - type as the hyde - bernardi sample .",
    "we believe this change in morphological mix is the primary reason why van der wel et al",
    ". saw what they did .",
    "we believe the real feature of interest is the drop in @xmath5 at @xmath24 where ( bernardi et al .",
    "2010a show that ) morphological mix is no longer an issue .",
    "van der wel et al .",
    "also see this drop , but they dismiss it .",
    "instead , we believe the narrowing of the distribution at @xmath23 marks the transition from dissipational to dissipationless histories , or a change in relative importance of sn and agn feedback ( e.g. kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ; shankar et al .",
    "2006 ) , while the decrease in @xmath5 at @xmath24 marks the transition to major dry mergers .",
    "this decrease has been expected for some time ( see gonzlez - garca & van albada 2005 ; boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2006 ; ragone - figueroa & plionis 2007 ; ragone - figueroa et al .",
    "2010 )  it was first found by bernardi et al .",
    "this is thought to indicate an increasing incidence of major radial mergers , since these would tend to result in more prolate objects .",
    "the right bottom panel of figure  [ breaks ] shows that color - gradients  here defined to be the difference between the model and petrosian colors  are maximal at @xmath26 .",
    "( the former are approximately the color within the half - light radius , whereas the latter are more closely related to the ratio of the total luminosities in @xmath27 and @xmath28 , so correspond to larger scales . )",
    "this is consistent with figure  b1 of bernardi et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , who used the same definition of color gradient .",
    "it is also consistent with roche et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who used a different estimator of the gradient : the ratio of the half - light sizes in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 bands . as we discuss below",
    ", we believe that the appearance of this same mass scale is again signaling the onset of major dry mergers .    whereas major mergers are expected to decrease color gradients ( e.g. di matteo et al .",
    "2009 ) , minor mergers should not change the gradients significantly ( kobayashi 2004 ) or they may enhance them slightly .",
    "this is because the smaller bluer object involved in the minor merger is expected to deposit most of its stars at larger distances from the center of the object onto which it merged .",
    "( if it had its own gradient , then the bluest of its stars would have been deposited at the largest radii . )    as a simple check of this argument , note that major mergers , which double @xmath2 , do not change @xmath3 ( appendix  c of bernardi et al .",
    "therefore , a plot of color gradient versus @xmath3 should show less of a feature than when gradients are plotted versus @xmath2 .",
    "this is indeed what we see in figure  [ breakss ] ( right bottom panel )  the correlation is almost flat at @xmath4 .",
    "such a plot should also show greater scatter , since a range of merger histories , hence gradients , can all have the same @xmath3 .",
    "while we do see this increase in scatter , note that the scatter in the gradient-@xmath2 relation grows even more dramatically  something that is not easily explained . on the other hand , the major merger picture also provides a natural explanation for why none of the scaling relations in figure  [ breakss ] show any feature at @xmath29 , and those that are most clearly sensitive to merger histories are almost completely flat .",
    "mergers are not the only way to produce or alter color gradients . in some models",
    ", gradients are related to feedback and winds ( pipino et al .",
    "our demonstration that gradients scale differently with @xmath2 than with @xmath3 may have interesting implications for such models .",
    "in addition , producing the downturn we see at @xmath24 is an interesting challenge for such models , as is relating this to the changes in size , @xmath3 and @xmath5 we have found . because the major dry merger model provides a simple framework for understanding all these relations , our results suggest that @xmath9 is the scale above which major dry mergers dominate the assembly history .",
    "we have found that a variety of early - type galaxy scaling relations  the size-@xmath2 , @xmath5-@xmath2 , color-@xmath2 and color gradient-@xmath2 relations  all show departures from a pure power - law at @xmath1 , whereas there is no such feature when @xmath2 is replaced with @xmath3 .",
    "since major dry mergers are expected to change the sizes , axis ratios and color gradients of galaxies while leaving the velocity dispersion and color unchanged , our findings suggest that the total stellar mass in early - types with @xmath30 today must have grown primarily by relatively recent major dry mergers . in bernardi",
    "et al . ( 2010b ) , we argue that such mergers may be required to reconcile the @xmath31 counts of objects with @xmath30 with those at @xmath32 .",
    "this particular mass scale also appears in analyses of a local sample ( higher quality data , but significantly smaller sample ) , where it is identified with the transition to dry mergers ( see page 270 and related discussion in kormendy et al .",
    "it is special in hierarchical models also .",
    "figure 3 of guo & white ( 2008 ) shows that below @xmath33 star - formation has been a significant part of the mean stellar mass growth rate ( much of it through wet mergers ) , whereas the stellar mass growth at masses above this occurs only through dry mergers .",
    "see hopkins et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and eliche - moral et al .",
    "( 2010a , b ) for other arguments suggesting dry mergers since @xmath31 are a natural and necessary part of the assembly history at @xmath30 . while it is reassuring that many lines of study all identify this same mass scale , we feel it worth emphasizing that our analysis suggests that above this mass scale , the mergers were not just dry  they were major . in this respect",
    ", there is some tension between our conclusions , and recent work which argues that although the mass in the central kpc or so of early - type galaxies has not grown since @xmath34 , the half - light radii have increased by more than a factor of two .",
    "this suggests that , since @xmath35 , mass has been added to the outer regions only : this sort of inside - out scenario for the growth is most easily understood if the mergers were minor ( e.g. lapi & cavaliere 2009 ; cook et al .",
    "2009 ; bezanson et al .",
    "2009 ) . however , as tiret et al .",
    "( 2010 ) note , the observation of constant mass in the central regions does not , by itself , exclude major mergers . in the simulations of gao et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , as an object assembles its mass through major dry mergers , the mix of particles in the central regions can change dramatically , even though the total mass in the central regions remains constant . our finding that color - gradients are erased at large masses may be indicating that this is indeed what happens at @xmath30 .",
    "finally , it is interesting to ask how bcgs , which are amongst the most massive objects in the local universe , fit into this picture ? compared to non - bcgs of similar mass or luminosity , their colors are slightly redder ( roche et al .",
    "2010 ; figure  10 in bernardi et al .",
    "2010b ) , they have smaller color gradients ( roche et al .",
    "2010 ) , and slightly larger sizes ( bernardi 2009 ) . whereas the first two are in agreement with our major merger picture ,",
    "the last suggests more size growth than is usually associated with major mergers .",
    "hence , it may be better to think of bcg formation as a two step process . in the first , the major mergers which result in the object becoming a bcg",
    "erase its color gradient ( and decrease @xmath5  bernardi et al .",
    "2008 ) ; thereafter , minor mergers puffed up its size .",
    "tidal stripping during the minor merger may also have contributed to the formation of intracluster light in its host halo ( bernardi 2009 ; bernardi et al .",
    "this two step picture is in striking agreement with a detailed analysis of the age , metallicity and abundance gradients of bcg ngc 4889 ( coccato et al .",
