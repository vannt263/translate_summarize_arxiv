    "the article focuses on the lie symmetry analysis of the rotating shallow water ( rsw ) model . in cartesian frame of reference",
    "the rsw equations have the following form @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the fluid velocity , @xmath2 is the free surface height over the flat bottom , @xmath3 is the constant coriolis parameter and @xmath4 is the constant gravity acceleration .",
    "the rsw model ( [ eq : model ] ) arises from the three - dimensional rotating incompressible euler equations ( see @xcite , pp .",
    "5963 ) under the following assumptions : a ) the scale @xmath5 of the vertical motion is much less than the scale @xmath6 of the horizontal motion , so that @xmath7 ; b ) the fluid density is constant ( @xmath8 ) ; c ) the external force is due to gravity , and pressure obeys the hydrostatic approximation @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the constant pressure on the free surface ) ; d ) the axis of rotation of the fluid coincides with the vertical @xmath11-axis .",
    "this nonlinear system of partial differential equations ( pdes ) is widely - used approximation for atmospheric and oceanic motions in the midlatitudes with relatively large length and time scales .",
    "the model applies to phenomena that do not depend substantially on temporal changes of the density stratification . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", it contains all essential ingredients of atmosphere and ocean dynamics at the synoptic scale .",
    "the main known mathematical results and physical applications concerning of the rsw model ( [ eq : model ] ) as well as its linear theory , quasi - geostrophic limit and etc are presented in @xcite@xcite .",
    "we recall here that the potential vorticity , defined by @xmath12 , is conserved on particles : @xmath13 . moreover , there are two important for applications non - dimensional parameters : rossby number @xmath14 and froude number @xmath15 ( here @xmath16 is the typical velocity scale for the flow ) . in non - dimensional form of the model @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 stand for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , correspondingly . in this study",
    "these parameters do not play a vital part .",
    "in fact , as result of obvious scaling transformations the system ( [ eq : model ] ) can be reduced to the equivalent one with @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( in case @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "one of the methods for studying of pdes is group analysis .",
    "this analytical approach based on symmetries of differential equations was originally introduced by sophus lie at the end - nineteenth century and further developed by ovsynnikov @xcite , olver @xcite and others . for each system of pdes",
    "there is a symmetry group , that acts on the space of its independent and dependent variables , leaving the form of the system unchanged .",
    "the classical lie symmetry analysis allows one to construct and study special types of analytical solutions of nonlinear pdes in terms of solutions of lower - dimension equations . for modern description of the theory",
    "see , for example , @xcite@xcite .",
    "many applications of group analysis to pdes are collected in @xcite .",
    "the classical lie method is an algorithmic procedure for which many symbolic manipulation programs were designed @xcite .",
    "this software became imperative in finding symmetries associated with large systems of pdes .",
    "exact solutions of nonlinear systems descriptive of fluid motions with moving boundaries are uncommon even in the shallow water approximation .",
    "freeman @xcite and sachdev @xcite have obtained solutions for gravity wave motions under the assumption that the flow is a simple wave . it is interesting to note that the similarity solution obtained in @xcite may be systematically generated by group methods @xcite . in the latter work ,",
    "symmetry analysis was often used to obtain analytical solutions to the nonlinear water - wave problems .",
    "symmetries and exact solutions of a nonlinear system that models the finite motion of a rotating shallow liquid contained in a rigid basin were studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . at present there known many examples of exact ( invariant and partial invariant ) solutions for nonlinear models of fluid dynamics @xcite@xcite and others .",
    "amount of analytical solutions to the euler equations govern the compressible inviscid flow were obtained within the framework of ovsynnikov s `` submodels programme '' @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate lie point symmetries and classes of exact solutions of the rsw equations . in section 2",
    ", we determine the 9-dimension lie algebra of infinitesimal transformations admitted by the rsw model .",
    "we also prove that the derived lie algebra of symmetries is isomorphic to the lie algebra of infinitesimal transformations admitted by ( 2 + 1)-dimensional shallow water ( sw ) equations .",
    "this allows one to use its known optimal system of subalgebras .",
    "moreover , we find the change of variables which transforms the rsw model to the sw equations .",
    "this is one of the principal results of the paper . in section 3 ,",
    "we derive and analyse finite transformations corresponding to the nontrivial symmetries of the rsw model . on basis of these transformations , in section 4 ,",
    "we construct new time - periodic exact solutions of the rsw equations .",
    "these solutions may be interpreted as pulsation of liquid volume under the influence of gravity and coriolis forces . in section 5 , using some two - dimensional parameterized classes of the optimal system of subalgebras we reduce the rsw model to the ordinary differential equations ( odes ) and integrate them .",
    "in particular , we construct and study exact solutions describing rotational - symmetric subcritical and supercritical regimes of the stationary flow as well as various non - stationary regimes of spreading and collapse of a liquid ring .",
    "on the basis of the group analysis of the differential equations we shall find the symmetry group of infinitesimal transformations associated with the rsw equations ( [ eq : model ] ) . following @xcite , let us define infinitesimal generator @xmath23 and its first prolongation @xmath24 @xmath25 here we use the following notations for convenience @xmath26 @xmath27 to determine the group of symmetries admitted by the system of equations ( [ eq : model ] ) , we act on it with the first prolongation of generator @xmath23 and go to the set of the system solutions . consequently , we get a system of the determining equations for the unknown functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 , that allows splitting in variables @xmath30 .",
    "let us omit the bulky intermediate calculations and present the final result of the symmetry group determination .",
    "the symmetry group associated with the rsw equations ( [ eq : model ] ) is generated by the following vector fields :    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    thus , the rsw equations ( [ eq : model ] ) are invariant under translations in @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , correspondingly ) , helical rotations with respect to @xmath34 ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , rotation ( @xmath41 ) , scaling symmetry ( @xmath42 ) and two complicated vector fields ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) which will be discussed below .",
    "the infinitesimal symmetries ( [ eq : oper - f-1])([eq : oper - f-3 ] ) form lie algebra @xmath45 .",
    "symmetry properties of the rsw equations in lagrangian coordinates were studied in @xcite .",
    "transition to lagrangian variables is a nonlocal change of coordinate .",
    "therefore lie groups admitted by the model in eulerian and lagrangian variables do not completely coincide . in particular , there are no nontrivial symmetries defined by generators @xmath43 and @xmath44 in lagrangian variables .    as mentioned above , in @xcite group analysis was applied to the model of rotating shallow liquid in a rigid basin with the following geometry @xmath46 it was shown that in the elliptic paraboloid case , @xmath47 , the symmetry algebra is spanned by six infinitesimal generators . in the circular paraboloid case , corresponding to @xmath48 , the symmetry algebra is larger  namely , 9-dimensional .",
    "note that these symmetries reduce to ( [ eq : oper - f-1])([eq : oper - f-3 ] ) for @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath51 be a given system of differential equations admitting a symmetry group @xmath52 .",
    "the basic property of solutions for @xmath51 is that any solution of the system @xmath51 carried over by any transformation of the group @xmath52 to a certain solution of the same system @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , two solutions of the system @xmath51 are said to be essentially different with respect to @xmath52 if they can not transformed to each other by any transformation of the group @xmath52 .",
    "thus , it is useful to enumerate subgroups of the group @xmath52 , which lead to essentially different solutions . by virtue of the fact that there are certain correspondences between the symmetry groups and lie algebras",
    ", it is enough to construct an optimal system of subalgebras @xmath53 ( see @xcite ) , i.e. the minimal set of subalgebras of @xmath54 , which exhaust all the essentially different invariant and partially invariant solutions to equations @xmath51 .    in the present case",
    "there is no need to construct the optimal system of the subalgebras for lie algebra @xmath50 since we can use the results derived from the symmetry analysis of the gas dynamic equations . in the case of zero coriolis parameter ( @xmath55 ) the model under consideration",
    "reduces to the sw equation ( or two - dimensional polytropic gas dynamic equations with polytropic exponent @xmath56 ) @xmath57 the lie algebra @xmath58 of infinitesimal symmetries of the sw equations is spanned by the following vector fields @xcite @xmath59 for this lie algebra @xmath58 , the optimal system of subalgebras @xmath60 , which includes 179 parameterized classes is presented in @xcite . by virtue of the following theorem , parameterized classes of this optimal system of subalgebras can be applied for obtaining invariant or partially invariant solutions of the rsw equations ( [ eq : model ] ) .",
    "lie algebras @xmath61 and @xmath62 are isomorphic .    proof",
    "let us redefine the basis of generators of the lie algebra @xmath50 so that @xmath63 the commutation relations for the lie algebra @xmath50 in this basis are displayed in table [ tab1 ] . the basis is a canonical one chosen so that the levi decomposition is immediately apparent from the commutation table",
    ". thus @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 constitute the maximal solvable ideal ( radical ) and the simple lie algebra @xmath67 .",
    "the nilradical of @xmath50 is abelian and is generated by @xmath68 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the commutation relations for the lie algebra @xmath61 are defined by the same table of commutators ( where symbols @xmath69 should be replaced by @xmath70 ) .",
    "the table of commutators for lie algebras @xmath61 and @xmath71 are coincide completely .",
    "consequently , lie algebras @xmath58 and @xmath50 are isomorphic .",
    "@xmath72    @xmath73    thus , to construct invariant or partially invariant solutions to the rsw equations ( [ eq : model ] ) we can use generators @xmath69 defined by formulas ( [ eq : oper - f-1])([eq : oper - f-3 ] ) and ( [ eq : oper - f - change ] ) as well as the parameterized classes of the optimal system of the subalgebras introduced in @xcite .      in view of the previous theorem arises important question .",
    "is there change of variables such that each generator @xmath69 @xmath74 reduces to generator @xmath70 ?",
    "in the case of existence one it is necessary to verify if the rsw equations ( [ eq : model ] ) reducible to the sw equations ( [ eq : sw ] ) under this transformation .",
    "the answer on the question is given by the following theorem , which can be easy proved by straightforward calculations .",
    "the models ( [ eq : model ] ) and ( [ eq : sw ] ) as well as their symmetries are related by the following transformation @xmath75    in fact , let us suppose that a set of functions @xmath76 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 satisfies to the rsw equations ( [ eq : model ] ) . then the immediate calculations show that the following set of functions @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , given by formulae ( [ eq : equiv - tr ] ) , satisfies to the sw equations ( [ eq : sw ] ) .",
    "thus , the models ( [ eq : model ] ) and ( [ eq : sw ] ) are related by the change of variables ( [ eq : equiv - tr ] ) .",
    "it is easy to clear up that each generator @xmath69 in the variables with prime ( [ eq : equiv - tr ] ) takes form @xmath70 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) , @xmath85 . using scaling it is possible to fix formulae ( [ eq : equiv - tr ] ) ( or reduce ( [ eq : model ] ) to the equivalent one with @xmath19 ) in order to @xmath86 for all @xmath87 without coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "however , this form is more convenient as it conserve physical dimension of the variables .",
    "note that the mapping ( [ eq : equiv - tr ] ) transforms any solution of the sw equations ( [ eq : sw ] ) defined for all time moments @xmath88 to the solution of the rsw equations ( [ eq : model ] ) defined only for bounded time interval ( @xmath89 ) or , may be , to the stationary solution .",
    "this change of variables allows one to construct solutions of the rsw model using known solutions of the sw equations and vice versa .    for example , let us consider constant solution of the sw equations ( [ eq : sw ] ) : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "obviously , in this case trajectories of fluid particles are lines . according",
    "to ( [ eq : equiv - tr ] ) we obtain the following solution of the rsw model ( [ eq : model ] ) @xmath93 solution ( [ eq : const - sw ] ) is defined over the finite time interval @xmath89 .",
    "note that particle trajectories have the following form ( after time elimination ) @xmath94 where @xmath95 here @xmath96 and @xmath97 are coordinates of the particle at @xmath98 .",
    "thus , each fluid particle moves around a circumference . however , these trajectories do not close because solution becomes invalid as time @xmath34 tends to @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",
    "this solution describes essentially two - dimension fluid flow . in the case",

    "+    it is interesting to note that the class of stationary rotationally - symmetric solutions of the rsw equations corresponds to the class of solutions of the sw model which is invariant under rotation ( generator @xmath259 ) and nontrivial projective transformation ( generator @xmath260 ) . on the basis of projective transformation exact invariant solutions of the sw model and two - dimension gas dynamic equations ( with special state equation )",
    "were obtain and studied in @xcite and others .",
    "let us consider the submodel derived by the invariant reduction of the rsw equations ( [ eq : model - pol ] ) using two - dimensional subalgebra @xmath261 of infinitesimal transformations . according to the algorithm of invariant solutions construction ,",
    "let us solve the equations @xmath262 to obtain the set of basic invariants @xmath263 the representation of an invariant solution is @xmath264 where @xmath265 . by substituting the representation of solution into ( [ eq : model - pol ] ) ,",
    "one obtains the system of odes for unknowns @xmath266 , @xmath267 , @xmath268 @xmath269    by virtue of the second equation ( [ eq : inv - mod-2 ] ) either @xmath270 or @xmath271 . in the first case",
    "we get the following class of solutions @xmath272 here @xmath273 is an arbitrary smooth function , and @xmath274 , @xmath275 are constants .",
    "solution ( [ eq : coll-1 ] ) , ( [ eq : coll-2 ] ) is defined over the finite time interval @xmath276 , @xmath277 .",
    "it has a singularity at @xmath278 . in some cases , depending on the choice of function @xmath267 , the solution has singularity at @xmath279 .",
    "notice , that surfaces @xmath280 are contact characteristics on the solution ( [ eq : coll-1 ] ) , ( [ eq : coll-2 ] ) .",
    "this allows one to interpret the solution as a collapse of a liquid ring ( or a liquid cylinder ) @xmath281 compressed by pistons which move according to the law @xmath282 so that the pistons surfaces coincide with the contact characteristics .",
    "in the course of the collapse of a liquid ring ( with @xmath283 ) , the radial velocity @xmath284 in the range of @xmath285 is bounded , whereas the liquid depth @xmath2 as well as the circular velocity @xmath116 ( with any @xmath286 ) increases infinitely .    the other class of solutions of submodel ( [ eq : inv - mod-1 ] )",
    "is derived in case @xmath287 , @xmath288 .",
    "whereas , @xmath289 and function @xmath290 are defined from cubic equation @xmath291 .",
    "the solution of the rsw equations ( [ eq : model - pol ] ) is obtained by using representation of solution ( [ eq : coll-1 ] ) .",
    "these unsteady solutions of the rsw equations can be also derived from well - known stationary rotational - symmetric solutions of the sw equations using transformations ( [ eq : equiv - tr ] ) which relate the models .",
    "submodel @xmath292 arises from the invariant reduction of the rsw equations ( [ eq : model - pol ] ) with the use of the subalgebra @xmath293 .",
    "indeed , in polar coordinates ( [ eq : polar ] ) generator @xmath294 has the following form : @xmath295 .",
    "the set of basic invariants of the generators @xmath296 and @xmath297 is @xmath298 thus , we get the following representation of the invariant solution @xmath299    substitution of representation ( [ eq : ring-1 ] ) into the rsw model ( [ eq : model - pol ] ) produces odes ( [ eq : inv - mod-3 ] ) . in the general case it is difficult to get a solution of the submodel ( [ eq : inv - mod-3 ] ) in closed form . let us take @xmath300 .",
    "then the second equation in ( [ eq : inv - mod-3 ] ) is fulfilled automatically , whereas the solution to the first and the third equations is given in an implicit form @xmath301 here arbitrary constants @xmath302 and @xmath303 are values of functions @xmath304 and @xmath305 at @xmath181 ( initial data for odes ( [ eq : inv - mod-3 ] ) ) .",
    "function @xmath304 is strictly decreasing by virtue of the first equation ( [ eq : inv - mod-3 ] ) ( due to @xmath306 ) .",
    "it follows from the last equation ( [ eq : inv - mod-3 ] ) that function @xmath305 increases as time grows if @xmath307 , otherwise @xmath305 decreases .",
    "if constant @xmath308 , the minus sign precedes the root in the first formula ( [ eq : ring-2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath309 and @xmath304 is strictly decreasing function .",
    "it is evident from the second formula ( [ eq : ring-2 ] ) that @xmath310 as @xmath311 ( integral in ( [ eq : ring-2 ] ) converges ) .",
    "the solution ( [ eq : ring-1 ] ) , ( [ eq : ring-2 ] ) can be interpreted as collapse of a liquid ring during the finite time interval @xmath312 $ ] . at @xmath181 liquid",
    "is located in the ring ( or in the cylinder ) @xmath313 .",
    "as time grows , impermeable boundaries of the ring move in accordance with the law @xmath314 providing the fulfillment of boundary condition @xmath315 .",
    "in contrast to the previous solution ( [ eq : coll-1 ] ) , ( [ eq : coll-2 ] ) at @xmath316 the circular velocity @xmath116 vanishes , whereas the radial velocity @xmath115 and the depth @xmath2 infinitely increase . at that , the moving pistons collapse into the origin @xmath187 .",
    "let us take @xmath317 .",
    "in view of @xmath318 , the plus sign precedes the root in first formula ( [ eq : ring-2 ] ) . as mentioned above , function @xmath268 decreases while @xmath319 .",
    "it is obvious from ( [ eq : ring-2 ] ) that radicand vanishes at some value @xmath320 . at time",
    "@xmath321 function @xmath304 changes sign from positive to negative and function @xmath305 grows for @xmath322 .",
    "the behaviour of solution for @xmath322 is similar to the previous case @xmath308 .",
    "thus , the solution can be interpreted as a partial spreading @xmath323 and collapse @xmath324 of a liquid ring .",
    "in this paper we have studied symmetry properties and some classes of exact solutions of the rsw model using group analysis . we have determined the 9-dimensional lie algebra of admissible infinitesimal generators .",
    "we have shown that the derived lie algebra of symmetries is isomorphic to the lie algebra of infinitesimal transformations admitted by ( 2 + 1)-dimensional sw equations .",
    "this allows one to employ its known optimal system of subalgebras for construction of essentially different invariant solutions of the rsw equations .",
