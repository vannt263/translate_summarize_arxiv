    "a natural question in semiclassical analysis is whether the knowledge of the joint spectrum of a quantum integrable system allows to determine the classical dynamics of the underlying integrable system .",
    "pursuing this question in such generality has been made possible thanks to the development of semiclassical analysis with microlocal techniques ( see for instance the recent books by dimassi - sjstrand @xcite , guillemin - sternberg  @xcite , and zworski  @xcite and the references therein ) which nowadays permits a constant interaction between symplectic geometry and spectral theory . in particular , these techniques led to the resolution of the inverse spectral question in a number of cases ; for instance : ( i ) compact toric integrable systems , in the context of berezin - toeplitz quantization  @xcite ; ( ii ) semiglobal inverse problem near the so called  focus - focus \" singularities of 2d integrable systems , in the context of @xmath1-pseudodifferential quantization   @xcite ; ( iii ) inverse theory for the laplacian on surfaces of revolution  @xcite ; ( iv ) @xmath2-dimensional pseudodifferential operators with morse symbol  @xcite .",
    "the flexibility of microlocal analysis makes us hope that more general integrable systems will be treated in the future .",
    "an interesting step is to understand what happens for _ semitoric _ systems on @xmath3-dimensional phase spaces @xcite , which form an important extension of toric systems .",
    "[ def : semitoric ] a @xmath4 _ classical integrable system _",
    "@xmath5 on a connnected symplectic @xmath3-dimensional manifold @xmath6 is _ semitoric _ if :    1 .   [ hii ]",
    "@xmath7 is the momentum map of an effective hamiltonian circle action .",
    "[ hiii ] the singularities of @xmath8 are non - degenerate with no hyperbolic component .",
    "[ h - proper ] @xmath7 is a proper map ( i.e. , the preimages of compact sets are compact ) .",
    "a _ quantum semitoric integrable system _ @xmath9 is given by two semiclassical commuting self - adjoint operators whose principal symbols form a classical semitoric integrable system .",
    "the notion of semiclassical operators that we use is defined in section  [ sec : semicl - oper ] ; it includes standard semiclassical pseudodifferential operators , and berezin - toeplitz operators .",
    "when @xmath6 is four - dimensional , toric systems form a particular class of semitoric systems for which @xmath8 is the momentum map of a hamiltonian @xmath10-action .",
    "the symplectic classification of toric systems was done by delzant  @xcite , and the quantum spectral theory in the case of berezin - toeplitz quantization was carried out in  @xcite .",
    "a simple corollary of this spectral theory is that the image @xmath11 , which is the so - called delzant polytope , can be recovered from the joint spectrum ; in view of the delzant theorem , this implies that the joint spectrum completely determines the triple @xmath12 up to toric isomorphism .",
    "the main difference with the toric case is that focus - focus singularities can appear in a semitoric system , making the system more difficult to describe .",
    "for instance , if there is at least one focus - focus singularity , the image of the moment map is no longer a convex polygon .",
    "moreover , new symplectic invariants appear ; according to @xcite , a semitoric system is determined up to isomorphisms .",
    "] by five symplectic invariants :    1 .   the _ number _ of focus - focus singular values of the system ; 2 .   a _ taylor series _ @xmath13 for each focus - focus singularity ( @xcite ) ; 3 .   a _ height invariant _ @xmath14 measuring the volume of certain reduced spaces at each focus - focus singularity ; 4 .   a _ polygonal invariant _ ( in fact , a family of polygons ) obtained by unwinding the singular affine structure of the system ; 5 .   an index associated with each pair of focus - focus singularities , called the _ twisting index_.    therefore , if one is able to recover these five invariants from the semiclassical joint spectrum of a quantum integrable system quantizing @xmath15 , then in effect one can recover the triple @xmath12 up to the appropriate notion of isomorphism . from @xcite , ( 2 )",
    "can be recovered .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that this is the case for invariants ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) .",
    "let us be more precise and state our main result .",
    "we will say that a semitoric integrable system @xmath16 is _ simple _ if it satisfies the following : if @xmath17 is a focus - focus critical point for @xmath8 , then @xmath17 is the unique critical point of the level set @xmath18 .",
    "our main theorem is the following .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath9 be a quantum simple semitoric system on @xmath19 for which the bohr - sommerfeld rules hold . then from the knowledge of the semiclassical joint spectrum @xmath20",
    ", one can recover the four following invariants of the associated classical semitoric system :    1 .",
    "the number @xmath21 of focus - focus values , 2 .",
    "the taylor series associated with each focus - focus value , 3 .",
    "the height invariant associated with each focus - focus value , 4 .",
    "the polygonal invariant of the system .",
    "of course , theorem  [ thm : main ] is not entirely satisfactory if one has in mind the problem of completely recovering the classical system from the joint spectrum of its quantum counterpart .",
    "however , there is one case where we can say more : for the simplest examples of semitoric integrable systems , which we call systems _ of jaynes - cummings type_. the characteristic of such a system is to display only one focus - focus singularity .",
    "one of the simplest yet most important models in classical and quantum mechanics was proposed by jaynes and cummings @xcite in 1963 , and it is now known as the _ jaynes - cummings model_.the jaynes - cummings model is obtained by coupling a spin with a harmonic oscillator . in this way one obtains a physical system with phase space @xmath22 and hamiltonian functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the point in the @xmath26-sphere @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote points in @xmath29 ( @xmath7 is the momentum map for the combined rotational @xmath30-actions about the origin in @xmath29 and about the vertical axes on @xmath31 ) .",
    "recently the second and third authors described in full the semiclassical spectral theory of this system  @xcite .",
    "a classical integrable system @xmath32 on a symplectic @xmath3-manifold @xmath6 is of _ jaynes - cummings type _ if :    * @xmath8 is a semitoric system ; * @xmath8 has one , and only one , singularity of focus - focus type .    a _ quantum integrable system @xmath9 of jaynes - cummings type _ is given by two semiclassical commuting self - adjoint operators whose principal symbols form a classical integrable system of jaynes - cummings type .",
    "the jaynes - cummings model is a particular example of a system of jaynes - cummings type .",
    "jaynes - cummings type systems form a large class of integrable hamiltonian systems because the structure of the singularity in part ( b ) is extremely rich , and it is classified by a taylor series @xmath13 , according to @xcite ( two such singularities are symplectically equivalent if and only if each and everyone of the coefficients in the taylor series coincide for both singularities ) . moreover , by @xcite every such taylor series can be realized as the taylor series invariant of an integrable system ( in fact , of _ many _ inequivalent such systems ) . accordingly",
    ", the moduli space of jaynes - cummings type systems is , from the point of view of hamiltonian dynamics , extremely rich . as a corollary of theorem [ thm : main ]",
    ", we solve the inverse spectral problem for quantum integrable systems of jaynes - cummings type .",
    "[ main2 ] let @xmath9 be a quantum integrable system of jaynes - cummings type on @xmath19 for which the bohr - sommerfeld rules hold .",
    "then from the knowledge of @xmath33 , one can recover the principal symbol @xmath34 up to isomorphisms of semitoric integrable systems .",
    "this theorem gives the first global inverse spectral result that the authors are aware of for integrable hamiltonian systems with focus - focus singularities ( and hence no global action - angle variables ) . in the context of hamiltonian toral actions",
    "( eg . toric integrable systems ) , all singularities are of elliptic type , which is strongly related to the dynamical and spectral rigidity of such systems  @xcite .",
    "we believe that allowing focus - focus singularities , which have a much larger moduli space , is an important step forward in the study of the inverse spectral problem for general integrable systems .",
    "the problem treated in this paper belongs to a class of semiclassical inverse spectral questions which has attracted much attention in recent years , e.g. @xcite , which goes back to pioneer works of brard  @xcite , brning - heintze  @xcite , colin de verdire  @xcite , duistermaat - guillemin  @xcite , and guillemin - sternberg @xcite , in the 1970s/1980s , and are closely related to inverse problems that are not directly semiclassical but do use similar microlocal techniques for some integrable systems , as in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "1em    we conclude this section by a natural question .",
    "the following corollary of theorem [ thm : main ] directly follows from the symplectic classification  @xcite of semitoric systems :    let @xmath9 and @xmath35 be quantum simple semitoric systems on @xmath19 and @xmath36 , respectively , for which the bohr - sommerfeld rules hold . if @xmath37 and if the twisting index invariants of @xmath34 and @xmath38 are equal , then @xmath34 and @xmath38 are isomorphic as semitoric integrable systems .    in view of this result , one question remains : can one obtain the twisting index invariant of a semitoric system from the data of the joint spectrum of the corresponding quantum system ?",
    "a positive answer to this question would lead to the definition of a new quantum invariant which would be quite robust ( since the twisting index between two focus - focus singularities is just an integer ) .",
    "let @xmath6 be a smooth , connected @xmath3-dimensional symplectic manifold .      an _ integrable system _",
    "@xmath15 on @xmath6 consists of two poisson commuting functions @xmath39 i.e.  : @xmath40 whose differentials are almost everywhere linearly independent @xmath2-forms . here",
    "@xmath41 are the hamiltonian vector fields induced by @xmath42 , respectively , via the symplectic form @xmath43 : @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath46 will be assumed to be proper throughout this paper .",
    "for instance , let @xmath47 be the cotangent bundle of the torus @xmath48 , equipped with canonical coordinates @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the linear system @xmath52 is integrable .",
    "an _ isomorphism _ of integrable systems @xmath53 on @xmath6 and @xmath54 on @xmath55 is a diffeomorphism @xmath56 such that @xmath57 and @xmath58 for some local diffeomorphism @xmath59 of @xmath29 .",
    "this same definition of isomorphism extends to any open subsets @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( and this is the form in which we will use it later ) .",
    "such an isomorphism will be called _ semiglobal _ if @xmath62 are respectively saturated by level sets @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath46 is an integrable system on @xmath6 , consider a point @xmath65 that is a _ regular value _ of @xmath8 , and such that the fiber @xmath66 is compact and connected .",
    "then , by the action - angle theorem  @xcite , a saturated neighborhood of the fiber is _ isomorphic _ in the previous sense to the above linear model on @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , all such regular fibers ( called _ liouville tori _ ) are isomorphic in a neighborhood .    however , the situation changes drastically when the condition that @xmath67 be regular is violated .",
    "for instance , it has been proved in  @xcite that , when @xmath67 is a so - called _ focus - focus _ critical value , an infinite number of equations has to be satisfied in order for two systems to be semiglobally isomorphic near the critical fiber .",
    "semitoric systems ( definition  [ def : semitoric ] ) form a particular class of integrable systems admitting an @xmath30 symmetry .",
    "it is therefore natural to introduce a suitable notion of isomorphism for such systems , which mixes the general notion defined in the previous section with the more rigid one coming from hamiltonian @xmath30-manifolds .",

    "when @xmath67 varies in the set of regular values of @xmath8 , the collection of the period lattices is a lagrangian subbundle of @xmath78 , called the period bundle .",
    "coming back to our case where @xmath46 is a semitoric system , there is a natural way to construct a basis of this lattice .",

    "let @xmath84 be the time that it takes to come back to @xmath17 following the flow of @xmath85 .",
