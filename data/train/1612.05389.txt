    "in many real world applications , generalizations of dynamical systems using fractional - order differential equations instead of classical integer - order differential equations have proven to be more accurate , as fractional - order derivatives provide a good tool for the description of memory and hereditary properties .",
    "phenomenological description of colored noise @xcite , electromagnetic waves @xcite , diffusion and wave propagation @xcite , viscoelastic liquids @xcite , fractional kinetics @xcite and hereditary effects in nonlinear acoustic waves @xcite are just a few areas where fractional - order derivatives have been successfully applied .",
    "in addition to straightforward similarities that can be drawn between fractional- and integer - order derivatives and corresponding dynamical systems , it is important to realize that qualitative differences may also arise .",
    "for instance , the fractional - order derivative of a non - constant periodic function can not be a periodic function of the same period @xcite , which is in contrast with the integer - order case . as a consequence",

    "stability analysis is one of the most important research topics of the qualitative theory of fractional - order systems .",
    "comprehensive surveys of stability properties of fractional differential equations and fractional - order systems have been recently published in @xcite . when it comes to the stability of linear autonomous commensurate fractional order systems , the most important starting point is matignon s theorem @xcite , which has been recently generalized in @xcite .",

    "our aim is to explore necessary and sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability and instability of a two - dimensional linear incommensurate fractional order system , which consists of a differential equation with a caputo - type fractional order derivative and a classical first order differential equation .    in the second part of this paper , we propose and analyze a two - dimensional fractional - order morris - lecar neuronal model , by replacing the integer - order derivative from the equation describing the dynamics of the membrane potential by a caputo fractional - order derivative , with careful treatment of the dimensional consistency problem of the resulting system .",
