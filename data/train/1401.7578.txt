    "this work is an approach to a new material , namely cerium doped strontium yttrate .",
    "sry@xmath0o@xmath1 is the only known stable interoxide within the system y@xmath0o@xmath3-sro  @xcite .",
    "the refractory oxide melts congruently at @xmath4c  @xcite .",
    "it was initially described in 1967  @xcite .",
    "its crystal structure was assigned to the calcium ferrate(iii)-type , crystallizing in the orthorhombic space group _ pnma _",
    "sry@xmath0o@xmath1:ce could be an appropriate uv to blue light converter  @xcite . moreover , the fabrication and characterization of single crystals are essential for new material research .",
    "europium doped sry@xmath0o@xmath1 has already been investigated as light phosphor  @xcite .",
    "xu et al . described the optical properties of sry@xmath0o@xmath1:eu@xmath2  @xcite confirming the assumption that trivalent europium ions are distributed on multiple sites  @xcite . recently",
    ", additional ree doped sry@xmath0o@xmath1 phosphors were investigated , including tb@xmath2 , tm@xmath2 , dy@xmath2 , and sm@xmath2@xcite .",
    "luminescence properties of cerium doped sry@xmath0o@xmath1 were investigated by blasse and bril detecting a strong luminescence band with a maximum in the green wavelength region  @xcite .",
    "the authors also claim a remarkably large stokes shift .",

    "explain the emission spectrum of sry@xmath0o@xmath1:ce air fired samples with the ce@xmath2 5d-4f transition ( blue band ) and tentatively assign the green emission to a ce@xmath5-o@xmath6 charge transfer  @xcite .",
    "the lhpg technique , based on the work of burrus and stone  @xcite , is suitable for the crystallization of sry@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "lhpg allows the application of almost arbitrary atmospheres , rapid crystallization rates , and effective distribution coefficients that are near unity . in ideal steady state conditions a constant mass transfer from the feed into the melt zone and from the melt zone into the scf is attained . in quasi - steady state conditions",
    "evaporating species generate a composition shift within the melt zone .",
    "however , a constant mass transfer into the fiber and therefore a constant composition will be possible .    if trivalent cerium substitutes on the y position of sry@xmath0o@xmath1 , no further charge compensation will be required .",
    "if ce@xmath2 substitutes on the sr position or ce@xmath5 is incorporated , charge compensation will be required .",
    "a valence - coupled diadochy can be formulated as follows according to  @xcite : @xmath7    two trivalent cerium ions substitute two sr@xmath8 ions within the sry@xmath0o@xmath1 lattice .",
    "the valence is compensated by formation of strontium voids .",
    "the incorporation of tetravalent cerium on the trivalent y position can be formulated likewise . concerning the ion radii of the involved ions ,",
    "tetravalent cerium is presumably incorporated on the y position  @xcite .",
    "the ce@xmath2 radius is about 101pm , if sixfold coordinated , and about 114pm , if eightfold coordinated .",
    "thus , it is unclear , if ce@xmath2 will be located on the y side ( 90pm , sixfold ) or on the sr site ( 126pm , sixfold ) .",
    ".composition of the atmospheres and other growth parameters for lhpg experiments .",
    "all gases had 5n ( 99.999% ) nominal purity .",
    "if a rest impurity is assumed as air , an oxygen partial pressure of @xmath9bar can be estimated for all atmospheres not already having o@xmath10 as a major component  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the growth parameters affect the dopant distribution and the content of the major elements .",
    "the composition shifts of an air - sintered feed rod , crystal fibers , and their corresponding frozen melt zones are presented in table  [ tab : sy2_deviation ] .",
    "some strontium evaporated already during the preparation of the feed rod .",
    "this loss can be minimized by reduced sintering temperature and duration . during the crystallization strontium ( and its oxides ) and cerium evaporated .",
    "condensed evaporated species could be collected and determined as mainly sro .",
    "while the deviations in oxidizing conditions ( oxidizing i ) and nitrogen atmosphere ( reducing i ) are similar , a hydrogen containing atmosphere strongly interferes the composition .",
    "large amounts of ce and sr evaporated and an scf could not be fabricated .",
    "these results are in accordance with the htms measurements and the calculated fugacities .",
    "the deviations are minimized in nitrogen atmosphere ( reducing i ) . moreover , the deviations of the main elements sr and y are constant .",
    "the cerium content within the fiber increases from the begin ( @xmath11% ) to the end ( @xmath12% ) .",
    "thus , in reducing atmosphere i , a quasi - steady state is attained with respect to the main elements .",
    "the cerium content is not only affected by the evaporation , but also by segregation .    for lhpg setups",
    "the effective distribution coefficient @xmath13 can be estimated by  @xcite : @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 as dopant concentration at the beginning and the end of the fiber , @xmath17 as dopant concentration within the feed rod , and @xmath18 as dopant concentration in the frozen melt zone .",
    "based on this equation we can estimate @xmath19 for crystallization in oxidizing atmosphere and @xmath20 for crystallization in nitrogen atmosphere . note that equation  [ eq : lhpg_pfann ] will be imprecise , if strong evaporation occurs . in this case , the steady state condition ( @xmath21 ) is never reached  @xcite .",
    "the average effective distribution coefficient is slightly higher than for the cerium distribution in calcium scandate  @xcite .",
    "this difference might arise from different doping mechanism . in calcium scandate cerium",
    "incorporates on the ca position . in sry@xmath0o@xmath1 cerium can be incorporated on the y position without charge compensation .",
    "the laser fluorescence emission and radiative lifetimes of crystal fibers that were grown in different atmospheres are depicted in figure  [ fig : sy2_atm1 ] . if fibers are crystallized in strongly reducing atmosphere ( black curve ) , a broad emission band will be excited with a peak wavelength at 489 nm .",
    "the location and structure of this band is similar to the luminescence from powder samples  @xcite",
    ". the radiative lifetime does not depend on the crystallization atmosphere and shows a single exponential decay with  @xmath22ns .",
    "the fluorescence curves and their radiative lifetime are in accordance with the reported blue emission band , caused by the 5d-4f ce@xmath2 transition  @xcite .",
    "we could not find evidence for any kind of ce@xmath5-o@xmath6 charge transfer luminescence , as reported by the same authors  @xcite .",
    "if fibers are crystallized in oxidizing atmosphere that stabilizes tetravalent cerium , luminescence will be quenched ( red curve ) . in this case",
    ", all cerium is tetravalent .",
    "nitrogen atmosphere during crystallization results in a luminescence ( green curve ) that led to considerable amount of trivalent cerium . however , a certain amount of tetravalent cerium has to be considered .",
    "the luminescence intensity seems to be related to the ce@xmath2/ce@xmath5 ratio that strongly depends on the oxygen fugacity , as reported in  @xcite . a proper accordance between the intensity of the luminescence and the ce@xmath2/ce@xmath5 ratio that can be assumed from the predominance diagram in figure  [ fig : fact_atm1 ] can be emphasized .",
    "o@xmath1:ce crystals that has been crystallized in reducing atmosphere i ( a , b ) and in oxidizing atmosphere i ( c ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the absorption coefficient can be calculated from transmission measurements .",
    "absorption of sry@xmath0o@xmath1:ce crystal fibers is shown in figure  [ fig : diss1_cs2_sy2_abs_1 ] .",
    "the scf that has been crystallized in nitrogen atmosphere reveals several absorption bands .",
    "two bands , located at @xmath23 nm and @xmath24 nm , can be detected in curve ( a ) , which was measured throughout the yellow - colored fiber at the begin of the crystallization process .",
    "curve ( b ) was taken throughout an orange - colored part of the same crystal fiber showing an additional absorption band located at @xmath25 nm .",
    "the additional absorption band might be related to incorporation of cerium on an additional crystallographic site .",
    "more precisely , cerium would be incorporated on the two y sites in the host lattice .",
    "if the total cerium concentration exceeds a certain value , it could be also incorporated on the sr site , resulting in absorption at larger wavelengths .",
    "this assumption would be in accordance with the europium doping mechanism for strontium yttrate  @xcite .",
    "the fiber including tetravalent cerium ( red curve ) reveals neither of the above mentioned absorption bands .",
    "the absorption can be compared to pure calcium scandate  @xcite and pure ceria , ceo@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "it is yet unclear , if tetravalent cerium is incorporated into strontium yttrate .",
    "however , an additional ceo@xmath0 phase could not be detected using xrd ( figure  [ fig : sy2_atm_pic2 ] ) .",
    "all three absorption bands can be tentatively assigned to trivalent cerium or crystal structure defects that are caused by cerium doping . because of the high overlap of absorption and emission cerium doped strontium yttrium oxide does not seem to be an appropriate material for laser ( self - absorption ) .",
    "note that the spectroscopic measurements are only a first approach to investigate the precise doping process .",
    "an approach to the investigation of a new material , sry@xmath0o@xmath1:ce@xmath2 , is given .",
    "using optimized growth parameters single crystal fibers , doped with trivalent cerium , can be fabricated . through thermodynamic calculations , supported by htms and elemental analysis , suitable conditions for lhpg growth could be determined .",
    "the crystallization atmosphere turned out to be a critical growth parameter as it affects the composition shift ( through evaporation ) and the cerium valence ( through oxygen fugacity ) . by crystallization in nitrogen atmosphere the evaporation of species",
    "is suppressed and trivalent cerium is stabilized .",
    "the amount of trivalent cerium can be estimated by laser luminescence intensity and absorption measurements .",
    "a certain fraction of tetravalent cerium has to be taken into account .",
    "the accurate ce@xmath2/ce@xmath5 ratio , dependent on the oxygen fugacity , is yet unknown . for a precise analysis",
    "bulk crystals with higher quality are required .",
    "thereby , ce@xmath2/ce@xmath5 could be analyzed using x - ray absorption spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "bulk crystal growth using czochralski technique , based on this study , could be a suitable method for high quality crystals and further analysis .",
