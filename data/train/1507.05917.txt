    "because they do not interact with each other and can be guided via optical fibers over long distances with relatively low losses , photons appear as ideal information carriers and are therefore put forward as the flying qubits in most of quantum communication protocols .",
    "the design of memories able to reliably store and retrieve photonic states is , however , still an open problem . the most commonly studied protocol , considered to implement such a quantum memory , is electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "this protocol was implemented in various systems such as cold atoms , gas cells , or doped crystals @xcite .",
    "although the doppler broadening might seem to lead to strong limitations , eit - based light storage in warm alkali vapors gives good results and is still a subject of active investigation @xcite . in the last years",
    ", some experiments were also performed in a raman configuration , using pulses which are highly detuned from the optical resonances in gas cells @xcite .",
    "the eit - based storage protocol in a @xmath0 atomic system relies on the long - lived raman coherence between the two ground states which are optically coupled to the excited level . when a strong coupling beam is applied along one of the two transitions , a narrow transparency window limited by the raman coherence decay rate",
    "is opened along the other leg of the system .",
    "because of the slow - light effect associated with such a dramatic change of the medium absorption properties , a weak probe pulse on the second transition is compressed while propagating through the medium .",
    "when this pulse has fully entered the atomic medium , it can be mapped onto the raman coherences which are excited by the two - photon process by suddenly switching off the coupling beam .",
    "it can be safely stored during times smaller than the lifetime of raman coherence .",
    "finally , the signal pulse can be simply retrieved by switching on the coupling beam again . in the raman configuration ,",
    "the coupling and probe pulses are optically far off - resonance but still fulfill the two - photon transition condition .",
    "the advantage is a large bandwidth , that allows to work with data rates higher than in the usual eit regime @xcite .",
    "atoms at room temperature in a gas cell are particularly attractive for light storage because of the simplicity of their implementation .",
    "the effects of the significant doppler broadening can be minimized using co - propagating coupling and probe beams , so that the two - photon resonance condition can be verified for all velocity classes : all the atoms can thus participate to the eit phenomenon as soon as they are pumped in the probed level . as a consequence , handy simple gas cells have turned out to be attractive for slow or even stopped light experiments @xcite . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we have reported on an added phase shift recorded for eit - based light storage experiments carried out in a helium gas at room temperature when the coupling beam is detuned from the center of the doppler line .",
    "the simple model that we have derived could not satisfactorily account for our observations that were recorded for intermediate detunings , e.g. close to the doppler broadening of the transition . in the present paper , we come back to this problem and provide new experimental results , _ i.e. _ time - dependent measurements of the retrieved signal phase shift , as well as numerical results obtained through the simulation of the full system of maxwell - bloch equations .",
    "the behaviour of these phase shifts with the coupling detuning seems satisfactorily accounted for by our simulations .",
    "we also perform numerical calculations in the raman regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secii ]",
    "we present the system and setup and describe how to measure the time - dependent phase shift of the retrieved pulse with respect to the coupling beam .",
    "we also briefly recall the system of maxwell - bloch equations which governs our system and describe their numerical integration . in section [ seciii ] ,",
    "we provide our experimental and numerical results and show that they qualitatively agree .",
    "we also apply our simulations to the far off - resonant raman case .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ seciv ] and give possible perspectives of our work .",
    "the atoms preferably used for eit storage experiments are alkali atoms , mainly rubidium and sometimes sodium or caesium .",
    "we choose here to work with metastable @xmath1he atoms , which have the advantage of a very simple structure without hyperfine levels : transitions are thus far enough one from another to investigate the effect of detunings of the coupling and probe beams on light storage and retrieval .    in our setup represented in fig .",
    "[ experimental scheme ] , a @xmath2-cm - long cell is filled up with @xmath3 torr of helium atoms which are continuously excited to their metastable state @xmath4 by a radio - frequency ( rf ) discharge at 27 mhz .",
    "each of the metastable ground states @xmath5 is hence fed with the same rate , denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the cell is isolated from magnetic field gradients by a three - layer @xmath7-metal shield to avoid spurious dephasing effects on the different zeeman components . a strong circularly - polarized field , called the control beam , propagates along the quantization axis @xmath8 .",
    "its power is set at @xmath9 mw for a beam diameter of @xmath10 mm . as shown in fig .",
    "[ atomic struture ] , the coupling field drives the transitions @xmath11 and @xmath12 . owing to the spontaneous transitions @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the atoms end up in the state @xmath15 within a few pumping cycles after the coupling beam has been switched on . as the atoms are at room temperature , the doppler broadening in the cell is @xmath16 .",
    "we denote by @xmath17 the detuning of the coupling frequency @xmath18 with respect to the natural frequency @xmath19 of the transition @xmath20 , at the center of the doppler line .",
    "once optical pumping is achieved , a weak signal pulse is sent through the atomic medium along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "its polarization is circular and orthogonal to that of the coupling beam : the signal therefore couples the state @xmath21 to @xmath22 and we denote by @xmath23 the detuning of the signal frequency @xmath24 from the center of the doppler profile .",
    "both signal and coupling beams are derived from the same laser diode , and their frequencies and amplitudes are controlled by two acousto - optic modulators . due to the efficiency of optical pumping through the coupling beam",
    ", we assume that the state @xmath25 remains essentially unpopulated during the whole process and we accordingly neglect the driving of the transition @xmath26 by the signal field .",
    "submitted to the coupling and signal fields , the atoms therefore essentially evolve in the three - level @xmath0 system @xmath27 ( see fig . [ atomic struture ] ) as long as the detunings @xmath28 , of the coupling and signal fields respectively , are small enough to avoid exciting neighbouring transitions .",
    "thanks to the absence of hyperfine structure , the range of allowed values for @xmath29 is , however , much larger than in alkali vapor experiments : indeed , on the positive detuning side the nearest state ( @xmath30 ) is @xmath31 ghz away from optical resonance @xmath32 , while , on the negative detuning side , the nearest state ( @xmath33 ) is @xmath34 ghz away .",
    "under eit conditions , the coupling beam opens a transparency window for the weak signal beam , which can therefore propagate without absorption through the medium if its spectrum is not too wide @xcite . in the experimental results we present",
    "hereafter , we used a signal pulse , which consists of a smoothly increasing exponential followed by an abruptly decaying exponential of respective characteristic times @xmath35 and @xmath36 ns .",
    "its maximum power is about @xmath37 and the beam diameter is about @xmath10 mm .",
    "different dissipative mechanisms influence the width of the eit window besides spontaneous emission , such as collisions and transit of the atoms in and out of the beams .",
    "these phenomena result in the decay of atomic coherences at the rates @xmath38khz for the raman coherence @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the optical coherence @xmath41 .",
    "we have shown previously that velocity changing collisions redistribute the pumping of the atoms over an effective width sligthly smaller than the doppler linewidth @xcite . in our conditions , with a coupling power of 18 mw , this effective width is experimentally estimated to be @xmath42ghz .",
    "due to power broadening , the width of the transparency window is then of the order of @xmath43 khz .",
    "the highly dispersive character of the medium under eit conditions can be used furthermore to store and retrieve a weak signal pulse : due to eit dispersion , the signal pulse indeed travels with a reduced group velocity and is temporally contracted .",
    "once the pulse has entered the cell , the coupling beam can be switched off : information about the signal pulse is then stored into the raman coherences . after a storage time @xmath44 , the control beam is switched on again , which releases the signal from the atomic coherence and ensures eit absorption - free propagation .",
    "note that in our experimental setup , the optical depth is only about 3.5 and the pulse can thus not be fully compressed in the cell .",
    "due to the finite width of the transparency window and the finite length of the cell , a part , typically @xmath45 % of the incoming signal energy , leaks out before the coupling beam is turned off and the storage period begins @xcite .",
    "a typical experimental record is given in fig .",
    "[ data processing]b .",
    "the first part of the detected signal is the leak and after a storage time @xmath46s , once the coupling beam is turned on again , the retrieved signal is clearly visible .",

    "this quantity can be measured through mixing the signal emerging from the cell with a small fraction of the control beam , via polarization optics .",

    "the value @xmath50 is measured in the absence of the signal ( one assumes that the introduction of the signal pulse does not substantially affect the measurement of @xmath50 ) .",
    "the phase of the coupling beam is varied via a piezoelectric actuator from one experimental run to another : the scan is slow enough so that it is assumed to be constant during both the writing or retrieval steps .",

    "it was verified both experimentally and numerically that the phase of the leak is constant ( @xmath66 ) and can therefore be taken as a reference for the time - dependent relative phase of the retrieved pulse @xmath59 .",
    "this time independence of the leak phase is ensured by the fact that its spectral content is much narrower than the eit bandwidth .",
    "this is obtained thanks to the shape of the signal pulse : a slow exponential increase , followed by a sharp decrease . the part of the pulse which contains only low frequencies enters first and gives form to a leak , whose phase is constant .",

    "the traces recorded on the oscilloscope present some spurious oscillations at a period of about @xmath109 ns . this noise is generated by the acousto - optic modulators and could be removed by numerically filtering the spurious frequencies during the data processing . in fig .",
    "[ results ] , the time origin corresponds to the begining of the retrieval , when the coupling beam is turned on again . at that time , the probe intensity starts increasing to form the retrieved pulse .",
    "we only plot the evolution of the extra phase shift @xmath69 when the signal intensity is high enough , typically from roughly @xmath104 ns to @xmath110 after the start of the retrieval .",
    "one can see that @xmath69 is not constant over the retrieval , and its magnitude increases with the optical detuning @xmath111 .",

    "these simulations are in good agreement with experimental results : both present the same general shape for @xmath112 , and the same qualitative behaviour with the optical detuning @xmath111 .",
    "one possible source for the observed discrepancies is our oversimplified treatment of the velocity distribution in the doppler profile . here",
    ", we indeed assumed that velocity changing collisions are efficient enough to instantaneously and perfectly redistribute atoms pumped in the probed level @xmath21 over the effective doppler profile so that all these atoms contribute coherently to the storage process as if the broadening were homogeneous .",

    "the absorption of the coupling beam measured experimentally could not be well reproduced by the simulations .",
    "this should also have an effect on the storage efficiency and on the temporal shape of the phase .",
    "note that in the simulation program , in order to `` minimize '' this problem , we use an averaged coupling intensity over the length of the cell as the input parameter , instead of the real coupling intensity measured at the entrance of the cell . note also that we have checked our numerical results agree with the analytic approximate solutions presented in @xcite .    to understand better the physical origin of the extra phase - shift @xmath69",
    ", we compared the time - dependent relative phase @xmath113 between the signal and coupling beams at the exit of the cell , obtained : _ i _ ) during the storage and retrieval of a weak signal pulse ( @xmath114 before @xmath115 and @xmath116 after the storage time @xmath117 , and _ ii _ ) during the direct eit - propagation of the same weak pulse in the medium , while the coupling amplitude remains constant .",
    "to compute @xmath118 in case _ i _ ) , we used the full simulation of maxwell - bloch set of equations , whereas in case _ ii _ ) we simply propagated each spectral component @xmath119 of the incoming pulse with the corresponding susceptibility @xmath120 .",
    "[ susceptibility ] simultaneously displays the results we obtained in both cases , for two different values of the optical detuning @xmath121 .",
    "the shape and order of magnitude for @xmath113 are clearly the same in cases _ i _ , _ ii _ ) : the main effect of the storage is to introduce a delay corresponding to the storage time @xmath44 .",
    "here we chose @xmath122 but we checked both experimentally and theoretically that this phase shift does not depend on this storage time .",
    "this suggests that the observed extra phase shift @xmath52 is essentially due to the propagation under eit conditions .",
    "indeed , the stored part presents a sharp decrease associated with many frequency components , and is thus very sensitive to dispersive effects .",
    "this problem should be taken into account for high speed information applications , like experiments performed in the raman configuration @xcite .",

    "these simulation results demonstrate a similar effect on the retrieved signal pulse phase , even slightly stronger than in our experimental conditions .",
    "we have also checked that our numerical results in the raman configuration agree with the analytic approximate solutions presented in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have experimentally investigated a time - dependent extra phase shift that appears in a storage - retrieval experiment , performed in a room temperature atomic cell , in optically detuned conditions .",
    "this phase shift varies with time and does not depend on the storage time .",
    "we have provided numerical simulations which qualitatively agree with the experimental results : in particular , it appears that the magnitude of the relative phase depends on the optical detuning , while its temporal shape is mainly given by the spectrum of the incoming pulse .",
    "we explain the existence of this extra - phase by propagation effects that can be understood by a simple propagation model under eit conditions with optically detuned beams .",
    "discrepancies may be due to an approximate treatment of doppler broadening in the cell .",
    "the results presented here might be of importance , particularly for light storage experiments performed in the far - detuned raman regime , as reported in @xcite .",
