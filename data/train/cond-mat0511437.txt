    "it has been recently suggested @xcite that a @xmath1 optical lattice of bose - einstein condensates @xcite may allow for the observation of a finite - temperature phase transition to a superfluid regime where the phases of the single - well condensates are coherently aligned .",
    "in fact , in an appropriate range of parameters , the thermodynamical properties of the bosonic lattice at finite temperature may be well described by the hamiltonian of the @xmath4 model @xcite , and , as it is well known , the @xmath1 @xmath4 model exhibits the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition @xcite .",
    "the bkt phase transition occurs via an unbinding of vortex defects : the low - temperature phase , for @xmath5 below the bkt temperature @xmath0 , is characterized by the presence of bound vortex - antivortex pairs and the spatial correlations exhibit a power - law decay . for @xmath6 the pairs starts to unbind ( see e.g. @xcite ) : in the high - temperature phase , only free vortices are present , leading to an effective randomization of the phases and to an exponential decay of the correlation functions .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the properties of bosons in deep optical lattices is the so called bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite , in which two terms are present : a kinetic term describing the hopping of the bosons with tunneling rate @xmath7 , and a potential term describing the interaction between bosons in the wells of the array with interaction energy @xmath8 ( which is proportional to the @xmath9-wave scattering length ) .",
    "the description of bosons in deep lattices by means of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian holds also at finite temperature , provided that the temperature effects do not induce the occupation of higher bands : for a @xmath1 optical lattice confined to a plane by a magnetic potential having frequency @xmath10 , this implies that the bose - hubbard hamiltonian description is valid up temperatures @xmath5 such that @xmath11 .",
    "when the average number of bosons @xmath12 per site is high enough and the interaction energy is larger than @xmath13 , one may map - _ also at finite temperature _ - the bose - hubbard hamiltonian in the quantum phase hamiltonian @xcite : the conjugate variables are the phases and the particle numbers of the condensates in the different sites of the lattice .",
    "thus , also at finite temperature , the phase diagram is determined by the competition of two energies : the josephson energy @xmath14 , proportional to the tunneling rate between neighbouring sites of the @xmath1 square optical lattice , and the interaction energy @xmath8 . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the quantum phase hamiltonian reduces to the @xmath4 hamiltonian , exhibiting then a bkt transition at @xmath16 : for @xmath17 the system as a whole behaves as a superfluid with phase coherence across the array . very accurate",
    "monte carlo simulations yield , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath18 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we determine the effect of the interaction energy @xmath8 on the bkt transition .",
    "when @xmath19 , a bkt transition still occurs at a critical temperature @xmath20 : we find that @xmath20 is smaller than @xmath0 and decreases with @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . intuitively speaking , the quantum phase hamiltonian , as well as the bose - hubbard hamiltonian , in the limit @xmath21 describes a mott insulator , while in the opposite limit , @xmath22 , the array behaves as a phase - coherent superfluid ( e.g. , see @xcite ) : thus , when @xmath8 increases , the superfluid region in the phase diagram decreases .",
    "although in two dimensions there is not long - range order at finite temperature due to the mermin - wagner theorem , still the system exhibits superfluid behavior for @xmath17 @xcite : thus one expects that @xmath20 should decrease when @xmath8 increases .",
    "we also find ( see section iii ) that , when @xmath23 is equal to the critical value @xmath24 , one has that @xmath25 , signaling the possibility of a ( @xmath26 ) quantum phase transition .",
    "the quantum phase hamiltonian describes also the behavior of superconducting josephson networks below the temperature @xmath27 at which each junction becomes superconducting @xcite .",
    "the momenta conjugate to the phases of the macroscopic wavefunctions of the superconducting grains are the number of cooper pairs , @xmath28 is the josephson energy of the superconducting josephson junctions and @xmath8 is the charging energy due to the coulomb repulsion between cooper pairs .",
    "we observe that , in superconducting josephson arrays , the interaction term is written in general as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the cooper pairs number at the site @xmath31 : @xmath32 is proportional to the inverse of the capacitance matrix and may be also non - diagonal ( i.e. , @xmath33 with @xmath34 ) . at variance , for bosons in deep optical lattices ,",
    "the interaction term is @xmath35 , which corresponds , in a suitable range of parameters , to a @xmath36 quantum phase model .",
    "the analogy between superconducting josephson networks and atomic gas in deep optical lattices is then clear : in each well of the periodic potential there is a condensate grain , appearing at the bose - einstein condensation temperature @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath37 is larger than all other energy scales , the atoms in the well @xmath31 of the @xmath1 optical lattice may be described by a macroscopic wavefunction .",
    "it becomes apparent , then , that an optical network can be regarded as a network of _ bosonic _ josephson junctions .",
    "furthermore , in both systems , when the interaction term is neglected respect to the energy associated to the particle hopping , one has that the whole @xmath1 array becomes superfluid at the temperature @xmath0 at which the bkt transition occurs , with @xmath0 smaller than @xmath27 for superconducting josephson networks and smaller than @xmath37 for bosonic josephson networks .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section ii we introduce the effective hamiltonian describing bosons hopping on a deep optical lattice and , by using a semiclassical approximation @xcite , we compute the effective josephson energy in presence of the interaction energy @xmath8 . in section iii",
    "we evaluate the effect of the quantum fluctuations on @xmath0 by putting in the renormalization group equations the effective josephson energy obtained in section ii ; a comparison with previous results is then carried out .",
    "details of the computations skipped in the text are in the appendix a. section iv is devoted to some concluding remarks .",

    "the root of eq.([radice ] ) indicates the critical point at which a bkt transition occurs .",
    "the eventual occurrence of a double root for eq.([radice ] ) might correspond to what is called in literature a _ reentrant _ behavior .",
    "indeed it has been often argued ( see refs . in the review @xcite ) that the quantum phase model may undergo at low temperatures a reentrant transition induced by the quantum fluctuations : namely , fixing @xmath23 and lowering the temperature , one could switch from an insulating phase to a superconducting one at @xmath20 and then , lowering further the temperature , one finds another critical temperature @xmath116 at which the system comes back ( _ reenters _ ) in the insulating phase .",
    "consistent with the reentrant scenario is the dramatic decrease of the specific heat at very low temperatures @xcite and , as discussed , the presence of double roots for @xmath0 in the renormalization group equations .",
    "the phenomenon of the reentrance - although not universal - is a non - perturbative effect : in fact , opposite results may be obtained by means of different truncations for the series expansion of the function @xmath117 . for instance , if in eq.([radice ] ) one expands the hyperbolic cotangent as @xmath118 , one gets an expression for @xmath119 which gives two roots for @xmath0 .",
    "if instead , for @xmath120 , one uses the expansion @xmath121 where the @xmath122 s are the bernoulli numbers @xcite , one obtains the equation : @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "since @xmath125 for @xmath126 , and @xmath127 for @xmath128 , if one truncates the sum in eq.([bernoulli ] ) to the @xmath129-th order with @xmath130 , one finds @xmath131 for @xmath132 and then eq.([bernoulli ] ) has two roots ; at variance , if one truncates the sum to the @xmath133-th order with @xmath134 , one finds @xmath135 for @xmath132 and eq.([bernoulli ] ) admits only one root .",
    "thus one can not truncate the sum in eq.([bernoulli ] ) to any finite order , even for @xmath136 ; the origin of this problem is that the expansion used to get ( [ bernoulli ] ) is a series with terms having alternating signs .",
    "in addition , to find the roots of the equation @xmath137 one has to evaluate the integral in ( [ delta ] ) up to @xmath138 , and , also with @xmath8 small , @xmath139 may become large requiring to use all the orders in eq.([bernoulli ] ) .",
    "a way to overcome the above mentioned difficulties is to use in eq.([radice ] ) the mittag - leffler expansion of the hyperbolic cotangent , i.e. @xmath140 : in this way eq.([radice ] ) can be written as @xmath141=0 \\label{radice_impr}\\ ] ] where @xmath142 .",
