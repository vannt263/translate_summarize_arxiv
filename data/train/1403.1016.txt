    "theorem [ thm1 ] and theorem [ thm14 ] were firstly obtained based on the following theorem [ thm2 ] given in @xcite via the separation theorem for convex sets .",

    "particularly , if @xmath5 and @xmath6 have no common zero point except @xmath17 , then the set @xmath20 is closed as well as convex , and is either the entire @xmath21-plane or an angular sector of angle less than @xmath22 .",
    "yakubovich @xcite gave an example indicating the set @xmath23 is not convex , which indicates neither theorem [ thm1 ] nor theorem [ thm14 ] holds for three or more quadratic functions .",
    "we shall also give an example to support it ( see example [ thm8 ] ) later . despite the general non - convexity of the set @xmath23 , one can impose additional conditions on quadratic functions @xmath24 to make the set @xmath25 be convex .",
    "there are many such extensions with applications to control theory ( linear systems ) @xcite .",
    "however , the case that these functions are ( homogeneous ) polynomials that have degree more than @xmath0 or even general homogeneous functions has not been studied yet , which can be used to deal with nonlinear systems . in this paper , we focus on the latter case .      in this subsection",
    "we introduce some preliminaries related to homogeneous functions and even ( odd ) functions .",

    "specially , the set @xmath31 denotes the unit sphere .",
    "based on the concept of dilations , the concept of homogeneous functions is introduced as follows @xcite :    [ homo ] a function @xmath32 is said to be homogeneous of degree @xmath33 with respect to the dilation @xmath27 , if @xmath34 for all @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",

    "wicks and peleties @xcite showed that if a switched linear system with two sub - systems has an asymptotically stable convex combination of its sub - systems , there exists a quadratic lyapunov function and a computable stabilizing switching law .",
    "feron @xcite proved the converse is also true by constructing a quadratically stable convex combination of the two sub - systems based on two total derivatives ( two quadratic forms ) of the existing quadratic lyapunov function and using the strict s - lemma .",
    "these results reveal the difference degree between linear systems and switched linear systems from the perspective of stability . due to their substantial contributions ,",
    "these results were quoted widely and embodied in the monograph @xcite on switched systems .",
    "however , these results have not been extended to nonlinear cases .",
    "this is for reason that it is difficult for switched nonlinear systems to construct stable convex combinations of the sub - systems , and the strict s - lemma can not be used to deal with derivatives of lyapunov functions of higher degrees .",
    "then interesting issues arise : may the strict s - lemma be extended to nonlinear functions of higher degrees ? may the above necessary and sufficient condition for switched linear systems be extended to switched nonlinear systems ?",
    "homogeneous nonlinear systems are a class of nonlinear systems that have properties similar to linear systems , and many interesting results of linear systems were extended to homogeneous nonlinear systems ( cf .",
    "cheng and martin @xcite proposed the concept of the lyapunov function with homogeneous derivative ( lfhd for short ) and applied it to testify the stability of a class of nonlinear polynomial systems . a nonlinear system admitting a lfhd is not necessarily homogenous , but still have some properties of homogeneous systems .",
    "for example , if a nonlinear component - wise homogeneous polynomial system admits a lfhd ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , its global stability is easily guaranteed .",
    "a nonlinear system admitting a lfhd can be regarded as an approximation of the center manifolds of a large class of nonlinear systems .",
    "hence to study such systems is theoretically significant and interesting .",
    "cheng and martin @xcite also gave methods to construct a lfhd for a component - wise homogeneous polynomial systems .",
    "in this paper , we use the concept of lfhd to characterize a class of switched nonlinear systems .      in order to describe this problem clearly ,",
    "the system considered in this paper is formulated as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a piece - wise constant , right continuous function , called the switching signal , @xmath53 is an integer no less than @xmath0 , and each @xmath54 is a continuous function of the state @xmath55 .",
    "a convex combination of the sub - systems of system denotes the system @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    throughout this paper",
    ", it is assumed that system admits a lfhd .",
    "that is to say , there exists a positive definite and continuously differentiable function @xmath59 , such that each of @xmath60 is a continuous , even and homogeneous function of the same degree with respect to the same dilation , and @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the @xmath63-th sub - system , @xmath64 denotes the derivative of @xmath65 along the solution trajectory of @xmath62 , @xmath66 .",
    "it can be proved that if system admits a lfhd , then for any given initial state , there exists a switching law driving the initial state to the equilibrium point as @xmath67 @xcite .    based on the concept of lfhd , the necessary and sufficient conditions given in @xcite can be restated as : if for system , each @xmath54 is linear and @xmath68 , then system admits a ( quadratic ) lfhd if and only if there exits a convex combination of its two sub - systems that admits a ( quadratic ) lfhd . in this paper",
    ", we will extend these results to nonlinear system with @xmath68 , and show that the necessary one does not hold when @xmath69 .",
    "the contributions of the paper include :    * we extend the strict s - lemma to the strict homogeneous s - lemma ( the shs - lemma for short , from the case @xmath70 are quadratic forms to homogeneous functions with respect to any dilation ) . in detail , we indicate that the strict s - lemma does not necessarily hold for homogeneous functions that are not quadratic forms , and give a necessary and sufficient condition under which the shs - lemma holds .",
    "* we use the shs - lemma to give a necessary and sufficient condition under which system ( [ 0 ] ) when @xmath68 admits a lfhd if and only if there exists a convex combination of its sub - systems that admits a lfhd , and show the `` if '' part still holds when @xmath69 . * a counterexample is given to show that even though system ( [ 0 ] ) when @xmath69 admits a lfhd , there may exist no convex combination of its sub - systems that admits a lfhd . *",
    "the s - lemma is extended to polynomials of degree more than @xmath0 under some mild conditions , and the extended results are called the homogeneous s - lemma ( the hs - lemma ) and the non - homogeneous s - lemma ( the nhs - lemma ) , respectively .    the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec2 ] gives the main results and some examples supporting the main results .",
    "the shs - lemma is first shown , then based on it , the asymptotic stability of switched nonlinear systems with two sub - systems is analyzed ; a counterexample about switched linear systems with more than two sub - systems is given ; at last , some non - strict s - lemmas are shown .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is a brief conclusion .",
    "until now , there have been four approaches to proving the s - lemma ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "it turns out that the two approaches given in @xcite and @xcite can not be generalized to prove the shs - lemma , since for homogeneous polynomials of degree more than @xmath0 , the positive definiteness can not only be determined by their coefficient matrices or the eigenvalues of their coefficient matrices ; the approach given in @xcite can not either , since unlike quadratic polynomials , graphs of polynomials of degree greater than @xmath0 are not necessarily spherically convex ( the concept of spherical convexity is referred to @xcite ) .",
    "the most fundamental approach , the approach given in @xcite can be generalized to deal with the case that the homogeneous functions are odd functions .",
    "however for the case that the homogeneous functions are even , it does not work either . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new approach that can be used to deal with both the two cases and to prove the shs - lemma .      we first prove theorem [ thm12 ] that is an extension of theorem [ thm2 ] to some extent , and then prove the shs - lemma ( theorem [ thm13 ] ) based on theorem [ thm12 ] .",
