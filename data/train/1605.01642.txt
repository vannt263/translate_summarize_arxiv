    "the knowledge and possible manipulation of the electronic relaxation time have been a subject of fundamental relevance in many areas of condensed matter physics , quantum optics and information technology .",
    "the decay times of quantum states is closely related to the lost of quantum coherence whose control may have important applications in the field of quantum computation , particularly in the preservation of quantum information coherence in a noisy environment . in this sense , the exploration of the ultrafast phenomena that determine the relaxation times even though they are longer than the coherence time , has become a fundamental issue in these topics of research . in this work",
    "we focus our attention in the possibility of changing the decay time of collective states in interacting quantum dots ( qds ) by changing their characteristic parameters and those of their 2d distribution .",
    "the generation of entangled states in quantum dot systems , the observation of their decoherence in times of the order of a picosecond as well as the transfer of coherence from a quantum macroscopic state have been demonstrated several years ago @xcite .",
    "presently it is possible to design these nano - scale systems that behave as artificial atoms , in the sense that they posses a well defined and controllable spectrum , at least at certain extent @xcite .",
    "+ since many of the physical properties and possible applications of these quantum systems depend on the eigenstates of the confined electrons @xcite , by controlling the physical characteristics of the interactive qds of a distribution , one is able to change the decay time of the collective states .",
    "the later one would depend on a very complex way on the eigenstates of the single quantum dot , as well as on several physical characteristics of the distribution .",
    "this is a highly relevant question that this work attempts to contribute to answer , by means of a simple but physically meaningful approach , based on well established approximations .",
    "we suggest electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) as a proof of concept .",
    "the insights reached on this phenomenology would provide some tools and possibilities to learn how to control the coherent lifetime of the electronic states in quantum dots , that has been largely a clue issue to increase the feasibility of using them to develop some important quantum devices @xcite .",
    "then , the understanding of the influence of the electronic properties of the single constituents on the emergent collective properties of these systems is truly important .",
    "+ the collective behavior of the qds has been experimentally studied by means of eels @xcite .",
    "this technique is used to analyze the behavior of the energy gaps of individual quantum dots as a function of particle size @xcite .",
    "furthermore , electron scattering in the low - energy version allows to analyze compositional aspects of quantum dots @xcite .",
    "it has shown to be a really useful experimental tool to investigate the dipolar response of nanocomposites @xcite .",
    "the whole dipolar response and ferroelectric behavior of qd distributions has been investigated theoretically , by means of the simulation of eels experiments @xcite .",
    "the only experiment related to our theoretical approach was reported in @xcite , although it was applied to nanocomposites .",
    "+ in this work the decay time of ferroelectric states of 2d distributions of self - assembled gaas quantum dots , embedded in an @xmath0 matrix is studied theoretically .",
    "the potential that confines the electrons inside the quantum dots is modeled by a step barrier potential approximation , and the inner and the outer regions have also different effective masses .",
    "the transitions between the individual quantum states result from the interaction of the confined electrons with the electron beam , where the excited states decay after a life time described by a damping parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the collective relaxation times are determined through the curves of the so - called energy loss function , as a function of the energy lost by the electron beam , for different values of @xmath2 and temperature .",
    "+ the interaction needed to generate a ferroelectric behavior in a distribution of qds is introduced here by the inclusion of a wetting layer in the system @xcite , and in the respective hamiltonian by means a weiss - like mean field approximation . additionally , in order to explore the role of correlations in the collective behavior of qds , we analyze their effect by means of the bragg - williams approximation .",
    "this theory has been applied to analyze order - disorder in grown quantum dots @xcite as well as in the calculation of magnetic properties of metallic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "+ the practical procedure is as follows .",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation and calculate the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of a 2d distribution of conical self - assembled quantum dots . in terms of the calculated quantum states of the distribution we determine the electric susceptibility and from its behavior",
    "we obtain the critical temperature ( @xmath3 ) , at this point the system present a phase transition and is accompanied by symmetry breaking . finally , we obtain the collective states due to the interaction with the electron beam , the response to external changes produces transitions and further decay later .",
    "we infer the decay time of the collective states through the width of the probability of energy loss distribution .",
    "we can understand our thermal state is entangled for a given temperature , and their coherence time is related with the relaxation times of the collective system .",
    "we start our numerical procedure by computing the energy states and corresponding wave functions of conical qds of gaas with radii @xmath4 nm and @xmath5 nm , which are embedded in an @xmath6 box of @xmath7 nm width . unless otherwise is specified , 15 nm dot radius is considered .",
    "geometry details are important for the determination of eigenstates and in turn the dielectric response @xcite .",
    "different shapes have been considered in previous calculations .",
    "we have chosen the conical confinement potential and those sizes , because they lead to clearer results for the dielectric response and the susceptibility , thus a sharper estimation of critical temperature can be obtained @xcite .",
    "the conical shape presents only azimuthal symmetry , which is easier to break by means of an applied electric field .",
    "these qds are therefore more easily polarized . as a consequence , properties near the ferroelectric transition",
    "are better estimated as mentioned before .",
    "new techniques have made possible the growth of nearly conical - shaped qds connected by a layer @xcite we solve numerically the time independent schrdinger equation , considering the one - band envelope function formalism and the hamiltonians are described below .",
    "the effective mass of the electron in the matrix is taken to be @xmath8 , while @xmath9 in the gaas qd .",
    "the potential step between the qd and the matrix is @xmath10 mev .",
    "the wetting layer is @xmath11 nm width .",
    "the external electric field is 1 mev / nm . we assume a realistic surface density of qds of @xmath12 .",
    "for several decades , quantum entanglement has been extensively studied , both with relation to the quantum mechanics foundations as well as to important applications @xcite .",
    "we have studied the cooperative behavior of a system composed by dipoles pertaining to the quantum states of the qds , by an approximation based on the ising model .",
    "this approach allows to reproduce the physics of phase transitions , which occur when a small change in a parameter such as temperature ( @xmath13 ) causes a large - scale qualitative change in the state of the system . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "there is not much random motion , and the configuration of the dipoles lined up with the external field is highly favored , while at sufficiently high temperatures , the random thermal motion destroys much of the effect of the field @xcite .",
    "+ fluctuations in the polarization are determinant in the behavior of the system in the critical region .",
    "usually fluctuations are sensed by means of the correlation function which is given by @xmath14 .",
    "typically these influences between the components of the system described with the spatial and temporal correlations , occur over a characteristic distance @xmath15 , known as the correlation length .",
    "a short @xmath15 means that distant dipoles are very weakly correlated .",
    "scale correlation length is obtained from the correlation function @xmath16 which depends usually on the spatial separation @xmath17 between a pair of dipoles @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we take into acount only spatial correlations . thus @xcite    @xmath20    where @xmath21 , is the position vector of site @xmath22 and @xmath23 denotes a thermal average .",
    "if the system is translationally invariant @xmath24 and @xmath25 depends only on @xmath26    @xmath27    if the dipoles are independent this quantity should be zero .",
    "away from the critical point the dipoles become uncorrelated as @xmath28 and hence the correlation function decays to zero . from equation ( [ hrij ] ) , the correlations are measured among the fluctuations of the dipoles away from their mean values . near the critical region , correlation function decays to zero exponentially with the distance between the dipoles as @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a constant .",
    "this is usually the case for large @xmath17 near criticality . in the critical region long - range order",
    "develops in the system , @xmath15 becomes very large and the equation ( [ eq : hsim ] ) breaks down .",
    "evidence from experiments and exactly soluble models shows that in these conditions @xmath16 decays as a power law    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is a critical exponent , and @xmath33 is the space dimensionality .",
    "it has been shown that the correlation length scales with the temperature according to @xcite    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the critical exponent which describes the correlation length scaling @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the simplest interaction which allows to reach a ferroelectric response in the distribution is a mean field approximation .",
    "this is better known as the weiss approximation and is established through a well known hamiltonian , that considers a potential felt by any qd due to the presence of their nearest neighbors    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the @xmath22th dipolar moment , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the coordination number and @xmath40 is the exchange integral .",
    "therefore , the problem of many interacting qds has been reduced to a problem of @xmath41 independent dots on which an effective field , @xmath42 is acting . by construction ,",
    "fluctuations are neglected in this field . to calculate the ferroelectric response within this approximation one has to solve the eigenvalue problem of the stationary schrdinger equation with weiss hamiltonian , @xmath43 , where the confined potential is implicitly included .",
    "+   + on the other hand , in the bragg - williams approximation the interaction among the qds is introduced by defining a short - range correlation @xmath44 , and long - range correlation parameter @xmath45 , both defined in terms of pairs of parallel or anti - parallel momenta .",
    "the bragg - williams procedure qualitatively incorporates fluctuations by the introduction of @xmath44 y @xmath45 as follows . for simplicity , for a 2d distribution",
    "it is assumed that the interaction energy @xmath40 between the nearest neighbors is constant , the pairs of dipoles are denoted by @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with the corresponding numbers of configurations @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "thus the energy is @xmath52    rearranging the dipoles , select @xmath53 , and since every dipole is connected with its neighbors @xmath53 , we have @xmath54    and similarly with dipoles",
    "@xmath55 , they are connected with their neighbors @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the number of qds with dipolar moment along the @xmath58 direction , @xmath49 is the number of nearest neighbor pairs of qds with dipolar moment also along the @xmath58 direction and @xmath41 is the total number of qds in the system @xcite .",
    "+ within the range @xmath59 $ ] , the parallel and antiparallel populations are : @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) , considering that they are connected with the density of one dipole ( global range ) , and with the dipoles correlation ( local range ) respectively , @xmath62    in this way the hamiltonian can be written in terms of the long - range correlation only , in the form known as the bragg - williams approximation @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the external electric field .",
    "+ given a 2d qd distribution of dipoles , their geometrical characteristics are taken into account in the @xmath45 parameter according to equation ( [ eq : hwb ] ) . in our calculations",
    "we adopt the value @xmath65 to describe a ferroelectric response .",
    "to incorporate the scaling hypothesis , we connect the equation ( [ eq : hwb ] ) with the temperature assuming a power law , equation ( [ eq : scala ] ) : @xmath66 @xmath45 is zero if the dipoles system is unorganized .",
    "physically , @xmath45 is the polarization per qd due to the interaction with the external electric field .",
    "thus , the relaxation times of the ferroelectric collective modes in the bidimensional distribution of qds can be affected by changes in the surface density of qds . in summary ,",
    "long - range order means the non - vanishing of the correlation when correlation length approaches infinity .",
    "we briefly describe the procedure by which we calculate the collective dipolar response of the 2d distribution of quantum dots .    .",
