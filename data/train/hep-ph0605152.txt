    "the last few years have seen a phenomenal resurgence in charm and quarkonium spectroscopy .",
    "it began in july 2002 when cleo presented evidence for a @xmath17-wave @xmath18 meson @xcite .",
    "this was the first new quarkonium state to be observed in almost twenty years . since then eight new charmonium like states have been observed @xcite plus the @xmath19 @xcite , the puzzling @xmath20 states @xcite , and the broad @xmath17 @xmath21-wave states @xcite .",
    "this collection of states have in some cases confirmed quark model and lattice qcd calculations while in other cases challenged our understanding .",
    "in other words it s an exciting time to be a spectroscopist ! in this mini - review",
    "i survey these new states , concentrating on conventional interpretations and suggesting non - quarkonium explanations when all else fails .",
    "my talk is complemented by voloshin s talk which concentrates on multiquark descriptions of some of these states @xcite .",
    "this mini - review starts with some brief remarks about conventional meson spectroscopy , radiative transitions , and strong decays along with comments about hybrid mesons ",
    "states with an excited gluonic degree of freedom .",
    "it is followed by a brief discussion of the charm - strange mesons and broad @xmath21-wave charm mesons primarily focusing on some recent experimental results and how we can test the identity of these states .",
    "the bulk of this review concentrates on the various new charmonium like states ; the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 s of the title . in the final section",
    "i summarize my conclusions about these states and suggest experimental tests of the interpretations .",
    "some of these topics have recently been reviewed by swanson @xcite .",
    "this section is intended to be a reminder of the template we are using to test for `` exotic '' states .",
    "we use the predictions of a specfic model @xcite as our template and briefly describe some details of this approach .",
    "an extensive review of quarkonium physics , including other calculations and detailed references , is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in quark potential models ,",
    "conventional meson quantum numbers are characterized by the @xmath11 given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total spin of the @xmath28 pair and the total angular momentum @xmath29 is found by adding @xmath27 to @xmath30 , the orbital angular momentum of the quark antiquark pair . to obtain the quarkonium spectrum",
    "one starts with a potential and solves the eigenvalue equation , schrodinger equation or otherwise , for orbital and radial excitations .",
    "the potential typically consists of a short distance coulomb potential expected from one - gluon - exchange and a linear confining potential at large separation .",
    "this phenomenological potential is in good agreement with the static quarkonium potential calculated using lattice qcd .",
    "in addition to the spin - independent potential there are spin dependent interactions which are @xmath31 corrections .",
    "they are found by assuming that the short distance one - gluon - exchange is a lorentz vector interaction and the confinement piece is lorentz scalar .",
    "this gives rise to multiplet splittings .",
    "for example , the @xmath32 splitting is attributed to a short distance @xmath33 contact interaction arising from the one - gluon - exchange while the splitting of the @xmath21-wave @xmath34 states is due to spin orbit interactions arising from one - gluon - exchange and the relativistic thomas precession piece in addition to a tensor spin - spin interaction .",
    "the recent measurement of the @xmath35 mass is an important validation of this picture .",
    "the properties of meson states can be further tested by calculating electromagnetic and strong decays ( and for that matter weak decays of stable states ) and comparing them to experiment .",
    "the calculation of radiative transitions are straightforward and are described in many places @xcite . for the strong",
    "decays we rely on the @xmath36 decay model which describes most strong decays reasonably well @xcite .",
    "decays of charmonium states up to @xmath37  gev were calculated by barnes godfrey and swanson @xcite with similar results obtained by eichten lane and quigg @xcite .",
    "these results can be used to test the properties of a newly discovered state to see if and where it fits into the expected charmonium spectroscopy .",
    "in addition to the conventional quarkonium states other hadron states are expected .",
    "multiquark states have a larger quark content than the conventional @xmath28 .",
    "the details are rather complicated and has spawned a subfield in the literature studying the different predictions for various possible configurations .",
    "for example , in one extreme these multiquark states consist of tightly bound @xmath38 and are referred to as `` tetra - quarks '' while the other extreme consists of loosely bound mesons such as @xmath5 and are referred to as molecules .",
    "i refer you to voloshin s contribution @xcite .",
    "the other type of exotic quarkonium state are the so - called hybrid mesons which have an excited gluonic degree of freedom .",
    "these are described by many different models and calculational schemes @xcite .",
    "the picture i prefer is analogous to molecular physics where the quarks move in adiabatic potentials arising from the gluons which can be compared to nuclei moving in the adiabatic potentials arising from the electrons in molecules .",
    "the lowest adiabatic surface leads to the conventional quarkonium spectrum while the excited adiabatic surfaces are found by putting the quarks into more complicated colour configurations .",
    "the adiabatic potentials have been calculated using lattice qcd @xcite . in the flux tube model",
    "@xcite the lowest excited adiabatic surface corresponds to transverse excitations of the flux tube and leads to a doubly degenerate octet of the lowest mass hybrids with quantum numbers @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath12 , @xmath44 and @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath45 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 quantum numbers are not possible in the quark model and are referred to as exotic quantum numbers . if observed , they would unambiguously signal the existence of unconventional states .",
    "lattice qcd and most models predict the lowest charmonium hybrid state to be roughly 4.2  gev in mass .",
    "charmonium hybrids can decay via electromagnetic transitions , hadronic transitions such as @xmath46 , and to open charm final states like @xmath47 .",
    "the partial widths have been calculated using many different models .",
    "there are some general properties that seem to be supported by most models and by recent lattice qcd calculations .",
    "nevertheless there are no experimental results against which to test these calculations so one should take these predictions with a grain of salt .",
    "two important decay modes are :    1 .   @xmath47 .",
    "most calculations predict that the @xmath48 should decay to a @xmath21-wave plus an @xmath27-wave meson . in other words",
    "@xmath49 final states should dominate with vanishing partial widths for decays to @xmath5 and a small partial width to @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath50 this mode offers the cleanest signature .",
    "if the total width is small it could have a significant branching fraction .",
    "a recent lattice qcd calculation finds that these decays are potentially quite large , @xmath51 although it should be noted that the calculation was for @xmath52 where @xmath27 is a light scalar meson@xcite .",
    "before proceeding to the puzzles i was asked to review i want to mention several other new states which have added to our understanding of meson spectroscopy .",
    "@xmath53 : :    this state was first announced by cleo at the 2002 ichep conference    @xcite .",
    "it s mass of @xmath54  mev is in good agreement with potential models    @xcite and lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 : :    while observed previously @xcite the cdf collaboration    recently presented a precise mass measurement which could confront    theoretical predictions @xcite . the observed mass of    @xmath55  mev compares    favourably to the lattice qcd result of @xmath56  mev    @xcite and the quark potential model result of 6271  mev ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath57 : :    this state was recently observed by belle @xcite and cleo @xcite .    the combined mass of @xmath58  mev is    slightly higher than the quark model prediction of 3623  mev ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ;    * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so that the quark model slightly overestimates the    @xmath59 splitting .",
    "eichten lane and quigg @xcite    studied the coupled channel contributions to @xmath60    states and found that this reduces the splitting , bringing it into    better agreement with experiment . @xmath35 : :    this state was recently observed by the cleo collaboration @xcite .",
    "its mass of @xmath61  mev gives the @xmath62 splitting of    @xmath63  mev which    implies a very short range contact interaction supporting the    lorentz - vector 1-gluon - exchange plus lorentz - scalar linear confining    potential .",
    "the predictions for this splitting had a very large    variation so this measurement is a useful constraint on models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ;    * ? ? ?",
    "taken together these results provide an important test of quarkonium spectroscopy calculations and help calibrate the reliability of the predictions .",
    "the @xmath64 was first observed by babar @xcite and the @xmath65 by cleo @xcite . both were subsequently seen and studied by belle @xcite .",
    "their properties are consistent with @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "two broad @xmath21-wave charm - strange mesons were expected with the @xmath66 state decaying to @xmath68 and the @xmath67 to @xmath69 @xcite . but both states are very narrow with the @xmath64 below the @xmath68 threshold and the @xmath65 below the @xmath69 threshold .",
    "this unexpected behavior created a major theory industry describing the @xmath70 states as multiquark states , molecular states , @xmath71 atom , and as conventional @xmath72 states but with some improvement needed in the models @xcite .",
    "what caught everybody s attention was how narrow these states were .",
    "the problem is in the mass predictions .",
    "once the masses are fixed the narrow widths follow @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of these states has been discussed elsewhere @xcite so i will restrict myself to comments on some new measurements by babar relating to radiative transitions @xcite . at the outset",
    "it was pointed out that for states this narrow radiative transitions are expected to have large branching ratios so measurement of radiative transitions is an important probe of their internal structure @xcite .",
    "babar obtained the following results @xcite : @xmath73 summing the br s there is a missing @xmath74 . where did it go ? recall that because @xmath75 is no longer a good quantum number for unequal mass quark and antiquark the physical @xmath76 j=1 states are a linear combination of @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xcite : @xmath79 so we expect the decay @xmath80 to occur and the measurement of its br can be used to determine the @xmath81 mixing angle via @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the photon energies for the two transitions and @xmath85 are the @xmath86 dipole matrix elements .",
    "the @xmath87 superscript refers to the total angular of the light quark in the heavy quark limit .    to summarize",
    ", the @xmath70 states appear to be the conventional @xmath76 @xmath72 states with their masses shifted due to strong @xmath27-wave coupling to @xmath88 and their nearness to the @xmath88 thresholds .",
    "while almost all the theoretical effort has concentrated on the @xmath70 states it is important to remember that the non - strange partners can also provide information that can test these models @xcite . specifically , quark model predictions are in good agreement with the masses and widths of the charm @xmath21-wave mesons .",
    "predictions for the radiative transitions have also been calculated .",
    "while the @xmath89 are too broad to be able to measure the radiative widths , it should be possible to measure the branching ratios of the radiative transitions of the narrow states . in particular , measuring the br s of the @xmath90 to @xmath91 and @xmath92 is a means of measuring the @xmath81 mixing angle @xcite .",
    "this state was observed by the selex collaboration in hadroproduction in @xmath94 and @xmath95 final states @xcite .",
    "it s measured mass is @xmath96  mev but with the odd properties of a narrow width of @xmath97  mev at 90% c.l . and the ratio of partial widths of @xmath98 .",
    "it has not been seen by other high statistics experiments @xcite so it s existence is in doubt .    for the sake of argument let s investigate what it might be @xcite .",
    "the possibilities mentioned in the literature are a @xmath99 state , a @xmath72 hybrid and multiquark assignments @xcite .",
    "the lowest @xmath72 hybrid is expected to be about 3170  mev so it is unlikely that we can identify the @xmath93 as a hybrid .",
    "the most plausible conventional @xmath72 states are the @xmath100 with a predicted mass of 2730  mev and the @xmath101 with mass 2900  mev @xcite .",
    "one could attribute the discrepancy with the @xmath93 mass to mixing with the 2-meson continuum .    if we assume",
    "the @xmath93 is the @xmath99 state we can calculate the open - flavour decay widths and find @xmath102 the total width is predicted to be @xmath103  mev and @xmath104 .",
    "this should be compared to the selex value of @xmath105 .",
    "clearly theory and experiment are inconsistent .",
    "it is possible to tune the model to obtain agreement but this fine tuning seems highly unlikely .",
    "we conclude that the selex @xmath93 needs confirmation .",
    "nevertheless , experiment should be able to observe the @xmath99 in @xmath106-meson decays with the largest decay mode predicted to be the @xmath69 final state .",
    "the @xmath107 should also exist about 200  mev higher in mass .",
    "three new @xmath60-like states have been observed with @xmath109 .",
    "their masses are consistent with the @xmath110 @xmath60 multiplet and the @xmath111 state . before turning to exotic interpretations we need to determine if they are conventional @xmath60 states .",
    "the @xmath0 was observed by the belle collaboration recoiling against @xmath112 in @xmath113 collisions @xcite .",
    "the mass and width were measured to be @xmath114  mev and @xmath115  mev .",
    "they find @xmath116 , @xmath117 ( 90% cl ) , and @xmath118 ( 90% cl ) .",
    "the decay to @xmath6 but not @xmath5 suggests it is an unnatural parity state .",
    "belle speculates that the @xmath0 is the @xmath111 given the @xmath119 @xmath120 .",
    "it s mass is roughly correct and the @xmath121 and @xmath57 are also produced in double charm production .",
    "this was also discussed by eichten lane and quigg @xcite . the predicted width for a @xmath122 with a mass of 3943",
    "mev is @xmath123  mev @xcite which is not in too bad agreement with the measured @xmath0 width .",
    "the identification of the @xmath120 as the @xmath119 implies a hyperfine splitting of 88  mev with the @xmath0 .",
    "this is larger than the @xmath124 hyperfine splitting and larger than predicted by potential models .",
    "the discrepancy could be due to several possibilities ; difficulty in fitting the true pole position of the @xmath125 state or strong threshold effects due to the nearby thresholds with @xmath27-wave and @xmath21-wave charm mesons .",
    "the dominant @xmath6 final states hints at the possibility that the @xmath0 is the @xmath126 state .",
    "it is natural to try the @xmath127 since the @xmath128 states are predicted to lie in the 3920 - 3980  mev mass region and the widths are predicted to be in the range @xmath129  mev @xcite .",
    "the dominant @xmath6 mode suggests that the @xmath0 is the @xmath130 state .",
    "the problems with this interpretation are that there is no evidence for the @xmath131 state in the same data and the predicted width of the @xmath130 is 135  mev ( assuming @xmath132  mev ) @xcite .",
    "finally , there is another candidate for the @xmath131 state , the @xmath3 .    to conclude ,",
    "the most likely interpretation of the @xmath0 is that it is the @xmath111 @xmath133 state .",
    "a test of this assignment is a search for this state in @xmath134 .",
    "the @xmath135 is seen by belle in the @xmath136 subsystem in the decay @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "the reported mass and width are @xmath138  mev and @xmath139  mev .",
    "it is not seen in @xmath140 or @xmath6 .",
    "the mass and width suggest a radially excited @xmath21-wave charmonium state .",
    "but the @xmath136 decay mode is peculiar .",
    "the combined br is @xmath141 .",
    "one expects that @xmath142 .",
    "this implies that @xmath143 which is unusual for a @xmath60 state above open charm threshold .",
    "this large width to @xmath144 led belle to suggest that the @xmath3 might be a charmoniun hybrid .",
    "the problem with this interpretation is that the @xmath23 mass is 500  mev below the lattice gauge theory estimate making the hybrid assignment unlikely .",
    "if we identify the @xmath135 with the @xmath145 @xmath146 state we expect @xmath6 to be the dominant decay mode with a predicted width of 135  mev @xcite which is consistent with that of the @xmath135 within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties . furthermore , the @xmath147 is also seen in @xmath106-decays .",
    "the decay @xmath148 is unusual .",
    "however , the corresponding decay @xmath149 has also been seen @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for this unusual decay mode is that rescattering through @xmath6 is responsible ; @xmath150 .",
    "another contributing factor might mixing with the possible molecular state tentatively identified with the @xmath9 .",
    "we therefore tentatively identify the @xmath135 as the @xmath145 @xmath146 state .",
    "this can be tested by searching for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 final states and by studying their the angular distributions ( @xmath145 can only decay to @xmath6 ) .",
    "the @xmath7 was observed by belle in @xmath151 with mass and width @xmath152  mev and @xmath153  mev @xcite .",
    "the two photon width is measured to be @xmath154  kev .",
    "the @xmath5 angular distribution is consistent with @xmath155 .",
    "it is below @xmath156 threshold .",
    "it is the obvious candidate for the @xmath157 @xmath158 state .",
    "( the @xmath145 can not decay to @xmath5 . )",
    "the predicted mass of the @xmath157 is 3972  mev .",
    "the predicted partial widths and total width assuming @xmath159  mev are @xmath160  mev , @xmath161  mev and @xmath162  mev @xcite in good agreement with the experimental measurement . furthermore using @xmath163  kev @xcite times @xmath164 implies @xmath165  kev which is within a factor of 2 of the observed number , fairly good agreement considering the typical reliability of 2-photon partial width predictions .",
    "there is no reason to believe that the @xmath7 is not the @xmath157 .",
    "however , for the sake of argument , let us consider the alternative possibility that it is the @xmath166 ( which is not supported by the angular distributions ) .",
    "the @xmath166 only decays to @xmath5 while the @xmath157 decays to both @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the ratio of @xmath167 .",
    "thus , the @xmath157 interpretation could be confirmed by observation of the @xmath6 final state .",
    "finally we note that both the @xmath157 and @xmath166 undergo radiative transitions to @xmath168 with partial widths @xmath169  kev and @xmath170  kev @xcite .",
    "eichten lane and quigg find these decays are suppressed due to coupled channel effects @xcite .",
    "it is potentially possible to observe all three @xmath172 states in radiative decays of the @xmath120 and @xmath173 to @xmath174 and @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "the partial widths of @xmath176 are 14 , 39 , and 54  kev for the @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 respectively .",
    "thus , all three @xmath86 branching ratios of @xmath180 are @xmath181 . observing these transitions",
    "would further test whether the @xmath0 , @xmath135 , and @xmath7 are in fact the @xmath127 states",
    "the @xmath9 was first observed by belle @xcite and subsequently confirmed by cdf @xcite , d0 @xcite , and babar @xcite .",
    "the mass of this state is @xmath182  mev and the width is @xmath183  mev ( 90 % c.l . )",
    "which is consistent with detector resolution .",
    "this stimulated considerable speculation with a number of interpretations proposed in the literature ; @xmath184 molecule , charmonium hybrid , glueball , and a conventional @xmath128 or @xmath185 state .",
    "i ll briefly examine the possible charmonium interpretations @xcite .",
    "only the @xmath186 and @xmath110 multiplets are nearby in mass .",
    "the @xmath101 , @xmath185 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 have @xmath189 ( although the @xmath190 is identified with the @xmath101 ) and the @xmath13 , @xmath179 , @xmath178 , and @xmath177 have @xmath109 .",
    "the observation of @xmath191 by belle @xcite and babar @xcite implies @xmath109 .",
    "an angular distribution analysis by the belle collaboration favours @xmath10 @xcite although a higher statistics analysis by cdf can not distinguish between @xmath10 or @xmath12 @xcite . assuming it is @xmath44 the only surviving candidate is the @xmath178 but as we have just seen the identification of the @xmath108 with the @xmath177 imples a @xmath110 mass of @xmath192  mev which is inconsistent with the @xmath178 interpretation .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the @xmath9 is a @xmath193 molecule or `` tetraquark '' state .",
    "this is discussed in detail by voloshin @xcite . however , as just mentioned , the @xmath12 is not totally ruled out and the predicted @xmath194 mass is not too far from the observed @xmath9 mass .",
    "a test of these hypothesis would be the observation of radiative transitions involving the @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing recently discovered state is the @xmath14 discovered by babar as an enhancement in the @xmath195 subsystem in @xmath196 @xcite .",
    "the measured mass and width are @xmath197  mev and @xmath198  mev .",
    "the leptonic width times @xmath199 was measured as @xmath200  ev .",
    "further evidence was seen by babar in @xmath201 @xcite and by cleo in @xmath202 @xcite .",
    "the first unaccounted for @xmath203 state is the @xmath204 .",
    "quark models estimate it s mass to be @xmath205  mev which is much too heavy to be the @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath14 therefore represents an overpopulation of the expected @xmath15 states .",
    "the absence of open charm production also argues against it being a conventional @xmath60 state .",
    "a number of explanations have appeared in the literature : @xmath206 @xcite , tetraquark @xcite , and @xmath60 hybrid @xcite .",
    "let us consider the possibility that the @xmath14 is a charmonium hybrid .",
    "the flux tube model predicts that the lowest @xmath60 hybrid mass is @xmath207  mev @xcite with lattice gauge theory having similar expectations @xcite .",
    "models of hybrids typically expect the wavefunction at the origin to vanish implying a small @xmath113 width in agreement with the observed value .",
    "lgt found that the @xmath18 hybrids have large couplings to closed flavour models @xcite which is similar to the babar observation of @xmath208 ; the branching ratio of @xmath209 combined with the observed width implies that @xmath210  mev .",
    "this is much larger than the typical charmonium transitions of , for example , @xmath211  kev . and the @xmath23 is seen in this mode while the conventional states @xmath120 , @xmath173 , and @xmath212 are not .    with this circumstantial evidence for the @xmath14 assignment what measurements can be used to test this hypothesis ?",
    "lgt suggests that we search for other closed charm modes with @xmath213 ; @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 .",
    "models of hybrid decays predict that the dominant hybrid charmonium open - charm decay modes will be a meson pair with an @xmath27-wave ( @xmath17 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 ) and a @xmath21-wave ( @xmath220 , @xmath70 ) in the final state @xcite .",
    "the dominant decay mode is expected to be @xmath221 .",
    "however the @xmath222 has a width of @xmath223  mev and decays to @xmath224 .",
    "this suggest the search for @xmath14 in the @xmath225 final state .",
    "evidence for a large @xmath221 signal would be strong evidence for the hybrid interpretation .",
    "having said this , it should be pointed out that models of hybrids have yet to be tested against experiment so we should be cautious . for example , if other modes that were expected to be suppressed like @xmath226 and @xmath227 are found to be comparable to the @xmath228 mode , the @xmath14 may still be a hybrid , but the decay models are simply not reliable .    another test is to search for partner states .",
    "it is expected that the low lying hybrids consist of eight states in the multiplet with masses in the 4.0 to 4.5  gev mass range with lgt preferring the higher side of the range @xcite .",
    "start by confirming that no @xmath60 states with the same @xmath11 are expected at this mass .",
    "then identify @xmath11 partners of the hybrid candidate which are nearby in mass .",
    "it would be most convincing if some of these partners were found , especially the @xmath11 exotics . in the flux - tube model the exotic states",
    "have @xmath39 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 while the non - exotic low lying hybrids have @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath12 , @xmath44 , and @xmath15 .",
    "in the last few years there have been many new results representing considerable progress in our understanding of the spectroscopy involving charm quarks . in some cases",
    "they have verified our models , in other cases they hint towards filling in missing multiplets , but most intriguing , in some cases they hint at non-@xmath60 states that could be our first evidence of qualitatively new types of hadronic matter .",
