    "since the invention of the integrated circuit , photolithography is one of the most important technologies in semiconductor industry . for photoresist patterning usually chromium masks are used as reticles .",
    "the high cost of chrome masks and long turnaround times from mask design to fabrication of the masks are often limiting the application of photolithographic techniques . in many scientific fields , especially biosciences , there is a growing interest in using lithographic methods .",
    "photolithographic techniques have already been applied for the fabrication of biosensors , microfluidic systems ( `` lab on a chip '' ) , electrode structures , patterning of cell culture substrates@xcite and for the light - directed fabrication of dna microarrays,@xcite just to name a few . an extensive review on soft lithography applications in biology and biochemistry is given by whitesides _",
    "et al._.@xcite    as a more affordable alternative to chromium masks , transparent films with patterns printed on a high resolution printer can be used in many applications.@xcite employing microscope projection photolithography@xcite to project these patterns onto a photoresist coated surface , microstructures with features as small as 1 @xmath1 m have been produced.@xcite    in this paper we describe the design and performance of a microscope projection photolithography system ( mpls ) employing a dmd spatial light modulator ( slm ) for pattern generation .",
    "mpls was designed to meet the requirements of the light - directed synthesis process for microarrays,@xcite but the versatile system can just as well be applied in other photolithography applications .",
    "a microarray , as described in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : lightdirectedsynthesis ] , comprises a large number of domains ( in the context of dna chips also called features ) , each of which contains identical single stranded dna molecules of a different sequence .",
    "typically the number of features is in the range of 10 ^ 2^ to 10 ^ 5^ for spotted microarrays",
    "( where droplets containing prefabricated dna are deposited onto the substrate surface ) , but more than a million features ( as on the affymetrix genechip^tm^ ) can currently be fabricated on a dna chip by using photolithographic techniques . usually glass is used as a support material .",
    "the surface mounted probes act as scavengers for complementary target dna molecules , which are applied to the microarray surface in solution . through base pairing the probes act as highly sensitive detectors for fluorescently labeled nucleic acids containing the complementary sequence .",
    "microarrays with feature sizes ranging from 10 @xmath1 m to several hundred microns are increasingly employed in research and diagnostic applications , mainly for the analysis of gene expression .",
    "singh - gasson _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite were first to apply micromirror technology for replacement of the physical chrome masks .",
    "similar approaches were reported by luebke _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , nuwaysir _ _ et al.__@xcite and kim _ et al._.@xcite gao _ _ et al.__@xcite employed dlp technology for dna microarray synthesis on microstructured substrates , with a different photochemistry using photogenerated acids to remove acid - labile protection groups . our approach",
    "to microarray fabrication focuses on a size - reduction of the microarrays ( with an increased feature density ) .",
    "due to the smaller dimensions of the microarray not only the amount of expensive biochemical ingredients for the in situ synthesis is reduced , but also the performance of the diffusion - driven hybridization process is expected to improve.@xcite in light - directed synthesis of microarrays the use of the dmd not only avoids the expense for the chrome masks but also circumvents the technical problems related to mask alignment . using this flexible technology the turnaround time from designing a microarray to its application",
    "is reduced to about one day .",
    "thus an iterative approach for the optimization of microarray designs is possible .",
    "compared with liquid crystal slms ( as also commonly used in video projection systems ) , the dmds have superior image contrast and , unlike the liquid crystal technology , dmds may also be used in the near uv range .",
    "the main requirements for the light - directed dna synthesis process are a sufficient light intensity in the near uv around 365 nm ( a dose of 7.5 j / cm^2^ is required for a complete exposure of the photolabile nppoc - groups@xcite ) and a sufficient image contrast .",
    "a local image contrast of the order of 1:100 or better ( as outlined below ) is desired .",
    "stray light leaking over short distances from exposed features to not exposed ones nearby ( e.g. due to astigmatism , spherical aberration , or diffraction at the edges of the micromirrors@xcite ) can introduce base insertion errors and can therefore affect the performance of the microarray .",
    "furthermore , thermal and mechanical stability of the optical system are an important issue . depending on the length of the oligonucleotide sequences to be synthesized ,",
    "up to 100 exposure steps ( four exposure steps per nucleotide ) are necessary .",
    "good alignment of the mask patterns is required . to succesfully synthesize features at the highest ( pixel ) resolution achievable with our setup ( 3.5 @xmath1 m )",
    "the maximum alignment error should be no larger than one micron .",
    "the basic idea of mpls is to use a spatial light modulator for displaying computer generated `` virtual photomasks '' in the focal plane of a microscope . for that purpose",
    "we make use of a dmd spatial light modulator and its driver electronics , both obtained from a secondhand commercial video projector ( anders+kern astrobeam 540 ) .",
    "the optics of a zeiss axiovert 135 inverted microscope is employed in a reverse optical path for image projection : using a 5@xmath0 ( 0.25 na ) fluar microscope objective ( zeiss ) , the image of the dmd - which is located in the intermediate image plane - is scaled down to 3.5 mm@xmath02.6 mm . as a light source for visible and near uv wavelengths we employ a 250 w ultra high pressure ( uhp ) mercury arc lamp also from a video projector ( optoma ep758 ) .",
    "the hardware described in the following sections is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "components shortcuts refer to annotations on fig .",
    "1(b ) .",
    "( 0.25 na ) fluar microscope objective ( fo ) , substrate to be patterned ( ps ) . ]",
    "ultra high pressure mercury arc lamps are optimized for use in video projection systems : they have an outstanding arc luminance and a very long life of up to 10000 h. the operation pressure of up to 300 bar causes considerable line broadening - resulting in an almost continuous spectrum , which is advantageous for display applications but can be a problem in photolithographic applications ( for example due to increased chromatic aberrations ) .    in our lithography setup",
    "the use of a uhp lamp has several advantages over a conventional mercury arc lamp .",
    "compared to the latter , the uhp lamp has a smaller and brighter arc region ( with an arc gap of typically 1 - 1.5 mm ) , resulting in an increased light throughput .",
    "the uhp lamp has a higher arc stability and has a very long life time of several thousand hours .    due to the requirement for high uv transmission we could nt use the highly optimized optics of the video projector .",
    "therefore the illumination optics had to be redesigned : a replacement lamp module for the optoma ep758 projector was built into an air cooled housing and connected via an extension cable to the lamp driver of the optoma projector ( vp2 ) .",
    "the arc of the 250 w uhp lamp is located at the inner focal point of the elliptical lamp reflector . to efficiently collimate the strongly divergent beam , a plano - concave diffraction lens ( l1)(25.4 mm diam .",
    ", f=50 mm , fused silica ) is placed between the lamp window and the outer focal point of the reflector .",
    "the dichroic mirror of the optoma lamp module ( f1 ) ( originally designed as a uv protection filter ) is employed as a uv cold mirror to cut down the visible light intensity to about 10 percent .",
    "uv light below 400 nm is efficiently reflected .",
    "infrared radiation is filtered using another uv cold mirror ( oriel ) ( f2 ) .",
    "finally a band pass interference filter ( f3 ) ( bk-370 - 35-b , interferenzoptik elektronik gmbh ) is used for selecting the wavelength band in the mercury i - line region ( @xmath2 nm ) required for the photodeprotection reaction .",
    "taking into account that the mercury i - line is considerably broadened due the high operation pressure of the lamp , we have to use a relatively wide band filter ( fwhm : 33 nm ) to achieve a sufficiently high uv transmission .",
    "the dmd is a spatial light modulator commonly used for image generation in dlp video projection systems . in our setup",
    "we use a dmd with xga resolution containing 1024@xmath0768=786432 square mirrors ( 16 @xmath1 m in size with a pitch of 17 @xmath1 m ) that can be tilted by an angle of + @xmath3 or -10@xmath4 relative to the normal axis of the chip .",
    "the two positions are referred to as on- and off - state : mirrors in the on - state reflect the incident light perpendicular to the dmd surface into the projection optical system , whereas mirrors in the off - state reflect light at an angle of @xmath5 relative to the dmd normal axis into a light trap .",
    "the dmd is oriented perpendicular to the optical axis of the projection system .",
    "the micromirrors tilt around their diagonal axis . we have rotated the dmd by @xmath6 around the optical axis , so that the incident beam and the reflected beam lie both in the horizontal plane of the setup . for better accessibility of the micromirror",
    "array the dmd board had to be removed from the projector chassis and reconnected to the driver board via a 148 pin extension cable . because the driver electronics of the projector remains unchanged",
    ", all sorts of video signals can be used to control the image display .",
    "connection to a pc with a dual - head graphics card proved to be useful , as one screen can be used for control purposes ( e.g. for running the dna synthesis control program which automates and coordinates photolithographic pattern display and the fluidics system ) while the other one is reserved for pattern display .      to reduce the size of our microarrays to a few mm^2^ we opted for a microscope projection approach .",
    "there are several benefits : by reducing the image area , the illumination intensity is increased by a similar factor , thus reducing the need for increased lamp power . a 250 w lamp does suffice in order to keep the time required for optical deprotection in a reasonable relationship to the total turnover time of the chip synthesis .",
    "use of the microscope also provides superior control of the image focusing and mechanical stability .",
    "an important aspect in the design of the lithography system is image contrast . in light - directed microarray synthesis",
    "stray light ( the term is used here for all kind of misguided light ) is much more critical than for example with photoresist .",
    "photoresist has a stronly nonlinear exposure characteristics and does nt respond to small stray light intensities below a threshold value . in microarray synthesis , there is no such threshold and stray light induced errors can accumulate over many exposure steps . within the total exposure time of about two hours ,",
    "stray light causes base insertion errors , affecting most of the synthesized dna strands .",
    "the whole synthesis process , involves about 80 exposures with different mask patterns , it extends over about 6.5 hours .",
    "so there is a demand for thermal and mechanical stability . to make use of the maximum pixel resolution of the setup ( which is 3.5 @xmath1 m )",
    "no movements caused by vibrations , tension release , or thermal expansion larger than about 1 @xmath1 m ( in the front focal plane of the objective ) can be tolerated .",
    "the micromirror array is placed in the image plane ( located outside the microscope frame ) of the inverted microscope . with infinity corrected microscope objectives ,",
    "a tube lens is necessary to project the image of the dmd to infinity .",
    "the adjustment of the distance between dmd and tube lens , which does not exactly equal the nominal focal length of 164.5 mm ( as specified by the manufacturer ) , is very crucial for the calibration of the setup , as explained later ( in sec .",
    "[ sec : chromcorrection ] ) .    a movable half mirror / half beamsplitter optical element ( m3 ) , located at the position of the microscope s fluorescence filter block , is used to reflect the light into the objective back aperture . by making use of the beamsplitter ,",
    "the light reflected back from the surface of the pattern substrate can be coupled into the microscope , therefore allowing exact focusing and direct observation of the image through the eyepiece .",
    "subsequently , for photopatterning the mirror part is used . in principle for this purpose a dichroic beamsplitter could be used , but then image artifacts due to reflections from the backside of the beamsplitter need to be eliminated .    among several objectives tested , we found the zeiss fluar 5@xmath0 ( 0.25 na ) as most suitable for dna chip fabrication , particularly for its superior uv transmittance and its large back aperture allowing for efficient light collection . over a working distance of 12.5 mm the image of the dmd",
    "is projected onto the dna synthesis substrate - a chemically modified glass surface - inside the reaction cell .",
    "a 10@xmath0 ( 0.30 na ) plan neofluar and a 20@xmath0 ( 0.5 na ) plan neofluar objective ( zeiss ) were successfully used to further reduce the image size .",
    "diminished contrast makes these objectives less suitable for light directed microarray fabrication .",
    "however , patterning of photoresist - having lower requirements on contrast - should be simple with these higher magnification objectives .    at a wavelength of 365 nm the diffraction limit of the 5@xmath0 ( 0.25 na )",
    "objective is 0.73 @xmath1 m",
    ". a significantly larger distance between adjacent features is necessary to achieve a sufficient local contrast for the light - directed fabrication process .",
    "for evaluation of the imaging quality a fast and simple method for generating patterns upon uv exposure is required .",
    "photographic films and photoresist turned out to be not very useful due to difficult handling and processing efforts .",
    "therefore we have developed a uv - sensitive film based on the photochromic dye spiropyran .",
    "spiropyran undergoes a structural change when exposed to uv - light .",
    "this results in a strongly increased light absorption in the visible range .",
    "preparation of photochromic films was performed in the following way : we dissolved 10 mg of spiropyran dye ( 1,3-dihydro-1,3,3-trimethyl-6-nitrospiro[2h-1-benzopyran-2,2-(2h)-indole ] , aldrich , cat . :",
    "27,361 - 9 ) in 1 ml of pmma photoresist(e - beam resist pmma 200 k ; ar - p 641.04 , allresist gmbh , strausberg , germany ) and spincoated a thin film ( thickness about 1 @xmath1 m ) onto a microscope slide .",
    "other resists - we also tried with microchem pmma and microchem su-8 50 - work equally well .",
    "the photoresist is used as a carrier material only .",
    "after spincoating , and brief heating on a hot plate ( 1 minute at 100@xmath4c ) the slides are ready for use .",
    "we found these photochromic films to be a well - suited imaging material . unlike with photoresist or photographic material",
    "no developing or other processing is required . under uv exposure",
    "the film changes from transparent to an almost opaque purple . with the intensities we usually apply ( 50 - 100 mw / cm^2^ )",
    "this happens within seconds .",
    "the process can be reversed by heating or by illumination with bright light ( at visible wavelengths ) .",
    "unless the spiropyran has been bleached with high irradiation doses , the films can be reused several times .    as a response",
    "to uv light the optical density strongly decreases . for",
    "a small exposure dose the optical density increases almost linearly with the dose of uv light . for larger doses",
    "d the optical density @xmath7 approaches saturation .",
    "upon very high exposure , photodegradation of the photochromic dye results in reduced od values .      since the depth of focus dof=@xmath8/na^2^ is only about 6 @xmath1 m for the 5@xmath0 ( 0.25 na )",
    "fluar objective ( at @xmath9365 nm ) , it is necessary to perform proper focusing each time a new patterning substrate is mounted on the sample holder .",
    "the focus range providing optimum contrast is even smaller than the depth of focus , thus perfect focusing of the pattern onto the surface is crucial .",
    "it can be achieved by observing the back reflection of the projected image ( from the patterning surface ) through the microscope eyepiece .",
    "this is easy to perform with visible light , but almost not feasible with uv light ( even with a uv sensitive ccd camera - due to the restricted size of the ccd chip - one can only see a small part of the image ) .",
    "if the back - reflected image of the pattern is perfectly focussed in green light , this usually is not true for uv at the same time .",
    "this is due to chromatic aberration .",
    "longitudinal chromatic aberration causes an axial focus shift@xcite usually resulting in a completely blurred image in uv . in the following",
    "we describe a method for the correction of this longitudinal chromatic aberration , so that focusing of the near uv image can be performed by observation ( through the eyepiece ) and focus adjustment under green light illumination .",
    "using photochromic films as a control for the quality of the projected uv pattern , we found that the chromatic aberrations can be compensated by fine - adjustment of the distance d between the dmd and the tube lens ( see fig .",
    "the distance d is roughly the nominal focal length of the tube lens of 164.5 mm . after focusing with green light ,",
    "the film is exposed with a control pattern in uv and subsequently inspected on a light microscope .",
    "the distance d now can be adjusted iteratively until the patterns imaged on the spiropyran slide indicate perfect focusing .",
    "just a small deviation of a few millimeters from the nominal focal length of the tube lens is necessary for chromatic correction .",
    "the tolerance of d , within which a good correction is achieved , is only a few tenth of a millimeter wide .",
    "once the chromatic correction procedure has been accomplished , focusing can always be performed under illumination with green light .",
    "for measuring the intensity at the image plane we used a laser power sensor ( ps10q , coherent inc . ) .",
    "the thermopile sensor was placed in the focal plane of the microscope objective . to measure the mean intensity ,",
    "a completely white image was displayed on the dmd . with the measured total power of 7.8 mw we determined the intensity in the image plane as 87 mw / cm^2^.    to study the uniformity of the illumination we projected the image onto a screen .",
    "the intensity was measured at different regions of the projected image . an asymmetric large scale deviation with a peak intensity of about 140 percent of the mean intensity",
    "is observed .",
    "this is due to the configuration of the illumination system : the uhp lamp s arc gap is oriented parallel to the optical axis , providing a very inhomogeneous illumination profile .",
    "for this reason in a video projection system an integrator element , e.g. an integrator rod ( which is a light guide with a rectangular cross section ) or a fly - eye lens array is employed to generate a very uniform illumination . using the integrator rod of the astrobeam projector turned out to be not feasible as the glass rod absorbs most of the uv light .",
    "we decided to flatten the illumination profile by using only a small homogeneous section of the light cone for illuminating the dmd .",
    "this way we sacrifice about 80 percent of the light .",
    "nevertheless , the remaining 20 percent of light allow photodeprotection to be performed in a reasonable time .",
    "alternatively , if such parts were available , a quartz integrator rod or an integrator plate ( fly - eye lens array ) could be used to achieve significantly higher light intensities .    to attain a more uniform illumination",
    "we employ the dmd for intensity leveling , similar as described by huebschman _",
    "et al._.@xcite for this purpose we have created an `` intensity leveling mask '' . the black and white images ( to be used as a photomasks ) can easily be leveled to reduce intensity variations to about @xmath1010 percent by pixelwise multiplication with this mask . to generate the intensity leveling mask ,",
    "a fully illuminated image ( all mirrors in the on - state ) is projected on the screen ( as described above , still without using the microscope objective ) and photographed with a nikon coolpix 4500 digital camera . deskewing the raw image using standard image processing software results in a 1024@xmath0768 pixel image , which finally has to be inverted and adjusted in brightness and contrast .",
    "the leveling mask is then projected onto the screen and a photometer is used to measure uniformity of illumination .",
    "in an iterative way image brightness and contrast are adjusted to achieve a uniform intensity within most of the image area .",
    "contour plots of the light intensity before and after intensity leveling are shown in fig .",
    "2 . only in the outermost corners of the image ( comprising about 10 percent of the total image area )",
    "the intensity is reduced to about 50 percent of the mean intensity .",
    "this is due to vignetting : light reflected from the corners of the dmd , which are located close to the edge of the entrance pupil , is partially blocked by the apertures of the tube lens respectively the microscope objective . applying intensity leveling we achieved a mean light intensity of 76 mw / cm^2^.",
    "the intensity values mentioned above were achieved using an interference filter with a fwhm of 33 nm and a maximum transmission of 60 percent at a center wave length of 370 nm .",
    "using a narrow i - line filter ( fwhm 12 nm at a center wavelength of 365 nm ; 35 percent maximum transmission ) provided significantly lower intensities ( about one ninth of the intensity achieved with the broad filter ) .",
    "the demand for a wide filter can be explained by the strong line broadening due to the high operation pressure of the uhp mercury arc lamp .",
    "light - directed synthesis of dna microarrays requires that the image is projected onto a substrate inside an inert reaction chamber , so that reactions can take place under a moisture free argon atmosphere .",
    "the synthesis substrate , a 0.17 mm thickness microscope cover glass , is forming the window of the reaction cell . hence the image has to be projected onto the inner face of the window . for image focusing ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : chromcorrection ] ) we use the small fraction of green light which is reflected back from the imaging surface into the microscope . applying a similar approach for contrast measurement is not practicable because the outer face of the cover glass contributes to back - reflection as well .",
    "multiple reflections in the microscope system ( e.g. from a beamsplitter ) may degrade the image contrast further .",
    "the difference in total light intensity throughput of our optical system between a `` full on '' and a `` full off '' image exceeds 3000:1 .",
    "we obtained this value using photochromic film for measurement .",
    "the aperture of the original projection objective built into the projector is much larger than the aperture of our setup , which is limited by the entrance diameter of the microscope objective .",
    "the tube lens is positioned at a large distance ( about 165 mm ) from the dmd - chip compared to the standard projector projection optics ( about 25 mm ) .",
    "therefore in our setup the collection efficiency for diffusely scattered light is much smaller than in the original configuration , leading to a greatly reduced background at `` full off '' .",
    "the unwanted background intensity increases significantly if patterns containing a large fraction of on - mirrors are displayed .",
    "this optical flare is due to multiple reflections between optical surfaces .",
    "use of optical elements with appropriate ar - coatings ( in the 365 nm range ) could possibly reduce this stray intensity .",
    "photons leaking to unexposed features can produce base insertions and therefore affect the function of the dna chip .",
    "the local contrast between neighboring features is particularly important for the light - directed dna synthesis process.@xcite it is limited by the point spread function , the airy pattern of the microscope objective .",
    "the patterns used for microarray synthesis typically have an array structure with a pitch of 17 @xmath1 m or less . to obtain an estimate of the stray light induced error rate we have measured the image contrast at high spatial frequencies .",
    "we found that the uv - sensitive films we already used for adjustment of the uv optics ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : chromcorrection ] ) are very well suited for testing the performance of the photolithography system . for visual inspection of the patterns we used an optical microscope ( olympus ix81 ) equipped with an automated x - y translational stage and with a high resolution ccd camera ( c9100 em - ccd , hamamatsu photonics ) .",
    "patterns of regularly spaced line pairs ( a pair thereby comprises a black and a white bar of equal width ) , were imaged onto photochromic film , prepared as described above .",
    "the spatial frequeny of the pattern was varied between 14 and 70 line pairs per millimeter ( lp / mm ) . using an exposure time scalebar ( subsequently imaged nearby the line patterns ) allowed us to determine the equivalent exposure time ( due to stray light ) within the dark lines . to obtain the relative stray light intensity this",
    "was set in relation to the exposure time ( see table  [ tab : straylighttab ] ) .",
    ".relative stray light intensities in dependence of the spatial frequency of the line pairs .",
    "stray light intensities were measured at the center of the unexposed lines . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     although most of the probe sequences synthesized contain synthesis errors ( mostly deletions and insertions ) , we found that hybridization on our microarrays is highly specific ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : hybandmmdiscrimination ] ) and highly sensitive .",
    "currently , with our microarray synthesizer , arrays comprising up to 25000 features can be synthesized . with a feature size of 4@xmath04 pixel and a separation gap width of 1 pixel ,",
    "25 pixels are required per feature .",
    "a reduction of the feature size to 3@xmath03 or 2@xmath02 pixels ( taking into account a separating gap of 1 pixel between the features ) would allow 49000 respectively 87000 features .",
    "preliminary results have shown that a reduction to 3@xmath03 pixels is possible , but due to increased stray light the quality of the synthesized dna is expected to decrease .",
    "this is in accordance with results from kim _",
    "et al._.@xcite in a numerical simulation of the synthesis process they found that the purity of the oligomers is greatly improved ( significantly less insertions ) just by increasing the spacing between features .",
    "the effects of stray light on the quality of the dna and on the function of the microarray are currently under investigation .",
    "the synthesis of a 25mer chip requires roughly 75 optimized exposure steps and subsequent base additions . with an exposure time of 90",

    "<S> 77 , 063711 ( 2006 ) we present a maskless microscope projection lithography system ( mpls ) , in which photomasks have been replaced by a digital micromirror device type spatial light modulator ( dmd^tm^ , texas instruments ) . employing video projector technology high resolution patterns , designed as bitmap images on the computer , are displayed using a micromirror array consisting of about 786000 tiny individually addressable tilting mirrors . the dmd , which is located in the image plane of an infinity corrected microscope , is projected onto a substrate placed in the focal plane of the microscope objective . with a 5@xmath0 ( 0.25 na ) fluar microscope objective , a fivefold reduction of the image to a total size of 9 mm^2^ and a minimum feature size of 3.5 @xmath1 m is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> the ultra high pressure ( uhp ) lamp of a video projector is a cheap , durable and powerful alternative to the mercury arc lamps commonly used in lithography applications . </S>",
    "<S> the mpls may be employed in standard photolithography , we have successfully produced patterns in 40 @xmath1 m films of su-8 photoresist , with an aspect ratio of about 1:10 . </S>",
    "<S> our system can be used in the visible range as well as in the near uv ( with a light intensity of up to 76 mw / cm^2^ around the 365 nm hg - line ) . </S>",
    "<S> we developed an inexpensive and simple method to enable exact focusing and controlling of the image quality of the projected patterns . </S>",
    "<S> our mpls has originally been designed for the light - directed in situ synthesis of dna microarrays . </S>",
    "<S> one requirement is a high uv intensity to keep the fabrication process reasonably short . </S>",
    "<S> another demand is a sufficient contrast ratio over small distances ( of about 5 @xmath1 m ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is necessary to achieve a high density of features ( i.e. separated sites on the substrate at which different dna sequences are synthesized in parallel fashion ) while at the same time the number of stray light induced dna sequence errors is kept reasonably small . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the performance of the apparatus in light - directed dna chip synthesis and discuss its advantages and limitations . </S>"
