    "xte j1650500  is an x - ray transient that was discovered with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ in 2001 @xcite , during the only outburst of the source detected thus far .",
    "based on its spectral and variability behavior xte j1650500  can be classified as a black hole candidate x - ray binary ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "optical observations of the source revealed an orbital period of 0.3205 days and a mass function @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "combined with a lower limit of @xmath4 on the inclination , this translates into an upper limit on the black hole mass of @xmath5 , with a most likely mass of @xmath24 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "observations with _ xmm - newton _  during outburst revealed a red - shifted fe k - alpha line @xcite , which suggests that the compact object is a rapidly spinning black hole .",
    "xte j1650500  has been observed at luminosities ( 0.510 kev ) ranging from @xmath7 ergs@xmath1   to @xmath8 ergs@xmath1  ( for an assumed distance of 2.6 kpc , see appendix [ app : dist ] ) . at low luminosities ,",
    "when it was in the hard state , the source showed two properties that have not been shown by any other transient black hole x - ray binary .",
    "oscillations with a period of 14 days were observed , which had similarities to the longterm oscillations observed in the transient millisecond - second x - ray pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 @xcite . also , six x - ray flares were observed @xcite . using _",
    "chandra _ and _ rxte _ data , @xcite observed spectral softening towards low x - ray luminosities , with the spectral power - law index evolving from 1.66@xmath90.05 at @xmath10 ergs@xmath1  ( 19 kev ) to 1.91@xmath90.13 at @xmath11 ergs@xmath1 .",
    "prior to our work , the source was not observed in quiescence .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of an _ xmm - newton _  observation of xte j1650500 , performed when the source was believed to be in quiescence , more than two and a half years after the source was last observed with _",
    "rxte _ and _ chandra _ in 2002 .",
    "about fourteen black - hole x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) have so far been observed in quiescence ( most of them with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ) , with detected 0.510 kev luminosities ranging from @xmath12 ergs@xmath1  to @xmath13 ergs@xmath1",
    "* see @xcite for a complete list of observed sources ) .",
    "these studies of quiescent bhxbs are playing a central role in the debate on the existence of black - hole event horizons .",
    "as noted by various authors @xcite , bhxbs have substantially lower quiescent x - ray luminosities than neutron star x - ray binaries ( nsxbs ) with similar orbital periods .",
    "usually , the neutron - star systems have a relatively bright soft , thermal component which is lacking in the bhxbs ( but sometimes also in nsxbs [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "this soft component is interpreted as coming from the neutron - star surface , either due to the cooling of the neutron star and/or due to a crustal heating by residual accretion onto the neutron star s surface .",
    "the absence of such a thermal component and the lower quiescent x - ray luminosities are therefore often interpreted as an indication for the presence of an event horizon in bhxbs . however , since the source of quiescent x - ray emission in both the bhxbs and the nsxbs is still under debate , this conclusion remains uncertain .",
    "several sources of quiescent x - ray emission have been proposed for bhxbs .",
    "it has been suggested ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) that advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) can explain the optical / x - ray ratios and x - ray spectra seen in quiescence .",
    "these flows also provide a possible explanation for the luminosity difference between black - hole and neutron - star x - ray transients in quiescence .",
    "@xcite suggested that coronal emission from rapidly rotating companion stars might be responsible for the quiescent x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , it was shown by @xcite that the x - ray spectra of five of the six quiescent bhxbs they studied were inconsistent with those of stellar coronae . finally , assuming that the hard state of bhxbs extends all the way to quiescence , another possibility is x - ray emission from a jet @xcite .",
    "regardless of the exact mechanism for the x - ray emission , @xcite suggested that at very low mass accretion rates bhxbs should enter a ` jet - dominated ' state in which most of the energy is released in a jet outflow instead of x - rays from the accretion flow . at similarly low mass accretion rates , the energy release from nsxbs",
    "is not expected to be dominated by jets .",
    "in addition to the luminosity difference between quiescent bhxbs and nsxbs , there also appears to be a positive correlation between the quiescent luminosities and orbital periods of bhxbs ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "based on a comparison with sources that have similar orbital periods one would expect a quiescent x - ray luminosity for xte j1650500  of @xmath14@xmath15 ergs@xmath1 .",
    "xte j1650500  was observed with _ xmm - newton _  from march 6 2005 14:59 ut until 03:42 ut the following day ( obs - id : 0206640101 ) . for this paper we analyzed pipeline - production data from the epic - pn and two epic - mos instruments , using sas version 6.1.0 .",
    "all three instruments were used with a medium thickness filter . for each of the three instruments background light curves",
    "were produced from all ccds combined , selecting only photons above 10 kev ( with pattern=0 and flag=0 ) .",
    "the resulting light curves showed very strong flaring for @xmath265% ( mos ) and @xmath275% ( pn ) of the observation .",
    "intervals free of flaring were singled out by selecting 50 s time bins with count rates below 0.65 counts@xmath1 ( pn ) or below 0.2 countss@xmath1 ( mos ) .",
    "the resulting good time intervals were applied to the ccd on which the source was located , using the standard selection criteria ( pattern@xmath164 for epic - pn , pattern@xmath1612 for mos , and flag=0 ) .",
    "this resulted in effective exposure times of 12 ks ( pn ) and 18 ks ( mos ) .",
    "images were produced in the 0.510 kev band with a binning that resulted in pixels of 5 , close to the full - width - at - half - maximum of the point spread function ( psf ) of the epic cameras .",
    "none of the images showed an apparent excess of photons at the location of the source .",
    "images in narrower energy bands across the 0.510 kev range did not show an obvious source detection either .",
    "next , we ran the sas task edetect_chain ( with default input parameters ) simultaneously on the three 0.510 kev images .",
    "no source was detected at the position of xte j1650500  ( r.a.=16:50:01.0 , dec=-49:57:45 ) .",
    "for the faintest source11 source counts were detected from this source ( pn and mos combined ) ] detected with edetect_chain we calculated the flux using pimms , assuming was obtained from spectral fits to _ xmm - newton _  data of xte j1650500  in outburst @xcite and is consistent with values obtained from radio measurements @xcite . ] an @xmath17 of @xmath18 atoms@xmath19 and a power - law spectrum with indices ( @xmath20 ) varying between 1.5 and 2.5 . for epic - mos we found unabsorbed fluxes between 2.0(7)@xmath21",
    "erg@xmath19s@xmath1  ( @xmath22 ) and 2.2(8)@xmath21 erg@xmath19s@xmath1  ( @xmath23 ) and for epic - pn we found fluxes between 3.1(9)@xmath21 erg@xmath19s@xmath1  ( @xmath22 ) and 3.5(9)@xmath21 erg@xmath19s@xmath1  ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "these numbers serve as conservative upper limits on the flux of xte j1650500 .",
    "alternative upper limits were obtained from the 0.510 kev images by extracting the counts from a 20radius circle centered on the position of xte j1650500 .",
    "this was done using the tool funcnts from the funtools package , which also extracted counts from a large pre - defined source - free background region and corrected for differences in the exposure map values between the source and background region .",
    "the numbers of counts ( source + background ) within this region were 22 , 18 and 35 , for mos1 , mos2 , and pn , respectively . using the tables in @xcite this leads to single - sided 3@xmath24 upper limits of 40.1 , 34.8 , and 56.7 on the total counts .",
    "the expected background counts for the three source regions were , 26.9 , 21.5 and , 44.1 , respectively , with errors of less than 5% .",
    "correcting for background and using the average exposure map values ( 17.7 ks , 15.6 ks , and 10.3 ks ) , this gives upper limits on the source count rate of 7.5@xmath25 , 8.5@xmath25 and 1.23@xmath26 countss@xmath1 .",
    "using pimms , correcting for encircled energy ( from psf integration ) , and assuming an @xmath17 of @xmath18 atoms@xmath19 , we get the following ( unabsorbed ) flux upper limits for power - law spectra : @xmath27 erg@xmath19s@xmath1  ( mos1 ) , @xmath28 erg@xmath19s@xmath1(mos2 ) , and @xmath29 erg@xmath19s@xmath1  ( pn ) , with the high values corresponding to @xmath23 and the low values to @xmath22 .",
    "we have observed the black hole x - ray transient xte j1650500  in quiescence . the source was not detected . assuming a distance of 2.6 kpc ( see appendix [ app : dist ] ) , the most stringent upper limits on 0.510 kev luminosity are @xmath0 ergs@xmath1  ( depending on the assumed shape of the spectrum ) , which corresponds to @xmath30 times the eddington luminosity ( @xmath31 ) for a black - hole mass of 4@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these values are similar to the quiescent luminosities of other bhxbs with similar orbital periods , even for a distance as low as 2 kpc ( which is consistent with our estimate ) .",
    "our luminosity upper limits follow the observed relation between orbital period and quiescent luminosity , although , as mentioned also by others , more systems with long periods need to be observed to firmly establish the existence of such a relation .",
    "longer observations are needed to detect xte j1650500  in quiescence or provide more stringent and useful upper limits on its luminosity , preferably with _",
    "chandra _ , which suffers relatively less from background flaring than _ xmm - newton _  and has a much lower non - flaring background than _ xmm - newton_.",
    "the authors would like to thank the referee for carefully reading the manuscript and for spotting an error in our flux calcualtions .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on observations obtained with xmm - newton , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
    "jh and whgl acknowledge generous support from nasa .",
    "here we derive a distance estimate for xte j1650500 , based on the luminosity at which the source made the transition from the spectrally soft state back to the spectrally hard state at the end of its 2001 outburst .",
    "@xcite studied such transitions in six black hole x - ray transients and found that they occur in a narrow rang of luminosity : 14% of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath31 ) , with an average of 2% of @xmath31 .",
    "the definition of the transition to the hard state is not entirely clear from @xcite , but we pick an _ rxte _ observation of xte j1650500  in which the spectral power - law index was around 2 , similar to the _ rxte _ observation that @xcite used for xte j1550564 . note that @xcite assumed a spectral index of 1.8 and an exponential cutoff at 200 kev for the bolometric correction ( to the 0.5 kev to 10 mev range ) .",
    "no observation with such a spectral index was present in the coverage of the soft - to - hard state transition in xte j1650500 , with a spectral index of 2 being the closest .",
    "we analyzed _ rxte _ observation 60113 - 01 - 39 - 02 and fitted the 3100 kev spectrum with a simple phenomenological model consisting of a disk blackbody , a cut - off power law , and a smeared edge , with @xmath17 fixed to @xmath18 atoms@xmath19 .",
    "the unabsorbed flux , extrapolated to the 0.5 kev to 10 mev range , is @xmath32 erg@xmath19s@xmath1 . assuming that this flux corresponds to 2% of @xmath31 , which is @xmath33 ergs@xmath1  for a 4 @xmath6 black hole , we derive a distance of 2.6@xmath90.7 kpc .",
    "this is consistent with the distance of 3 kpc derived by @xcite , following a similar method .",
    "the main contributors to errors on the distance are the spread in the fraction of @xmath31 at which the soft - to - hard transition occurs ( fractional error @xmath250% ) and uncertainties introduced by extrapolating well outside the spectral fit range ( @xmath230% ) ."
