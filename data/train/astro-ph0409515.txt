    "the determination of the star formation rate ( sfr ) history of the universe is one of the most interesting results extracted from the deep photometric and spectroscopic surveys of the last decade .",
    "a large number of measurements have been collected , at low ( the canada - france redshift survey at @xmath13 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and high redshift from the hubble deep field north @xcite , the large samples of u and b drop - out galaxies @xcite , up to the most recent determinations based on i - dropouts at redshift @xmath14 from the goods , udf and udf - parallel acs fields @xcite .",
    "these studies show that the sfr ( uncorrected for dust ) increases from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , stays approximately constant in the redshift range @xmath17 , and starts to decline at larger redshifts . in all the cases quoted above the determination",
    "is based on the estimate of the total uv galaxy luminosity density , that for a given imf is proportional to the instantaneous sfr @xcite . as discussed by many authors ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "this approach is affected by the uncertainties of dust correction , but roughly agrees with other estimators at low to intermediate redshifts ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution can be tested against the measured sfr history @xcite .",
    "so far , all determinations of the sfr history have suffered from some major limitations .",
    "high redshift samples have been small in number due to the limited field of view of deep pencil - beam surveys , resulting in large poissonian fluctuations and large field - to - field variations ( cosmic variance )",
    ". the faint - end of the luminosity function ( lf ) is thusfar only poorly constrained at high redshifts , implying large completeness correction factors .",
    "finally , the technique used to generate the high - redshift galaxy catalogues ( drop - out selection , optical magnitude limited survey ) might have introduced biases by selecting only specific types of galaxies and possibly missing relevant fractions of uv light @xcite .    here we try to minimize these uncertainties and determine the sfr history of the universe with improved accuracy up to @xmath1 .",
    "our sample of high redshift galaxies is based on two deep fields , the ( i and b selected ) fors deep field ( fdf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the ( k - selected ) goods - south field @xcite . both cover a relatively large sky area , reducing the problem of cosmic variance .",
    "both are deep enough to allow the detection of several galaxies , thus minimizing the effect of shot noise .",
    "accurate photometric redshifts ( @xmath2 for the fdf and @xmath3 for the goods - south field ) with only @xmath19 % catastrophic failures allow us to measure the uv luminosity function down to fainter limits than spectroscopic samples .",
    "a detailed comparison of the uv luminosity functions of the fdf with the lf derived in large surveys was presented in @xcite and shows good agreement in the overlapping magnitude range at all redshifts .",
    "finally and most importantly , the two fields provide us with b - band , i - band and k - band selected catalogues , making it possible to assess the dependence of the sfr on the detection band and galaxy colors and the associated selection biases .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec_photometry ] we discuss the photometry and the photometric redshifts of the two fields , in  [ sec_sfr ] we present our results on the sfr history , and in  [ sec_conclusions ] we draw our conclusions . throughout the paper we use ab magnitudes and adopt a concordance cosmology with , , and .",
    "the present results are based on photometric catalogues derived for the fdf ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ubgri,,zjks bands ) and the goods - south fields ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ubvrijhks bands ) .",
    "the two fields cover approximately the same area ( 39.81 arcmin@xmath20 for fdf and 50 arcmin@xmath20 for goods ) ; the fdf reaches effective absolute magnitude limits @xmath21 mag deeper than goods - south ( see below ) .",
    "we use the i - band and b - band selected fdf catalogues as derived in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the b and i selected catalogues list 5488 and 5557 bona - fide galaxies ( having excluded the one known bright quasar in the field ) down to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the i+b catalogue obtained by merging these two contains 6756 entries .",
    "photometric redshifts for the fdf galaxies have an accuracy of with only @xmath24% catastrophic outliers @xcite .",
    "our k - band selected catalogue for the goods - south field is based on the 8 @xmath25 arcmin@xmath20 j , h , ks vlt - isaac images publically available , taken with seeing in the range @xmath26 .",
    "the u and i images are from goods / eis public survey , while b v r are taken from the garching - bonn deep survey .",
    "data reduction is described in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the data for the goods field were analyzed in a very similar way to the data of the fdf .",
    "the objects were detected in the k - band images closely following the procedure used for the fdf i and b band detection @xcite , using both sextractor @xcite and the yoda package @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "we detected 3367 objects in k - band for which we derived magnitudes ( fixed aperture and total ) in all bands .",
    "number counts match the literature values down to @xmath27 , which is the completeness limit of the catalogue , in agreement with the number obtained following @xcite .",
    "note that much deeper acs based catalogues are available @xcite , but as we are focusing on the k - selection they are not relevant in this context .",
    "we computed photometric redshifts following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , in preparation ) and using the same sed template spectra as for the fdf .",
    "the comparison with the spectroscopic redshifts of the vimos team @xcite and the fors2 spectra released at http://www.eso.org/science/goods/ , shows that the photometric redshifts have an accuracy @xmath28 .",
    "similar results are obtained when comparing to the combo-17 @xcite data .",
    "this is nearly a factor of 2 better than @xcite obtained using ground - based plus hst / acs data .",
    "stars are identified and excluded as in @xcite , as well as known agn @xcite , leaving 3297 bona - fide galaxies used in the further analysis .",
    "[ fig : sfr : cont_absmag_fdf_goods ] shows the distribution of galaxies ( slightly smoothed with a gaussian kernel ) in the rest frame @xmath29  absolute magnitude @xmath30 vs. redshift plane , computed by integrating the best fitting sed over the band definition ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the contours agree remarkably well at the bright - end showing that the number density of bright galaxies does not significantly depend on the wavelength at which they were selected ( for the b - band , this is of course only true up to @xmath32 ) . for better comparability of the fdf and goods - south samples at the faint - end , we chose a consistent magnitude cut - off for all samples in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr : cont_absmag_fdf_goods ] .",
    "this magnitude cut - off corresponds to the completeness limit of the goods - south sample and is about one magnitude brighter than the completeness limits of the fdf b and i samples . for the redshift bins defined by the limits 0.45 , 0.81 , 1.21 , 1.61 , 2.43 , 3.01 , 4.01 , 5.01 , the cut - offs in @xmath30 are at -15 , -16 , -17 , -18 , -19 , -20 , -20 .",
    "the @xmath30 lfs and the related parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the b , i , and ( i+b ) selected fdf samples are almost identical .",
    "we derived consistent values for @xmath35 ( ) for all three samples considered here , similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "consistent faint - end slopes ( @xmath36 ) were obtained using a brighter subset of the data set ( i.e. 1 mag brighter than the 50% completeness limit ) .",
    "objects that were detected in only one band and not in both are all faint and do not contribute significantly to sfr determined from the integral over the lf .",
    "@xcite show that the steeper slope of other surveys is largely due to shallower limiting magnitudes .",
    "this is supported by an analysis of dropouts from goods and the hubble ultra deep parallel fields @xcite where an @xmath35 of -1.15 was derived .",
    "compared to lf parameters of the optically selected samples , the @xmath30 lf of the k - selected sample has slightly brighter values of @xmath33 , significantly lower values in @xmath34 and , within the large errors , a similar faint - end slope @xmath35 . since the slightly shallower k - selected sample does not allow us to constrain the faint - end slope to the same level as our fdf sample ( but is consistent with the faint end slope @xmath10 determined for that field ) , we adopt this value for our k - selected sample .    we examine the consequences of these findings for the sfr in the next section .",
    "we compute the sfr for all 4 catalogues from the total luminosity densities @xmath37 in the 1500   band .",
    "first , we derive @xmath37 at a given redshift by summing the completeness corrected ( using a @xmath38 correction , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) lfs up to the absolute magnitude limits .",
    "second , we apply a further correction ( to zero galaxy luminosity ) zgl , to take into account the missing contribution to the luminosity density of the fainter galaxies . to this end",
    "we use the best - fitting schechter function . for the fdf catalogues",
    "the zgl corrections are only 2 - 20% in size .",
    "the small zgl correction employed here owes itself to the faint magnitude limits probed by our deep fdf data set and the relatively flat slopes ( @xmath39 ) of the schechter function . due to the brighter magnitude limit , the zgl corrections for the goods catalogue can be as high as 50% .",
    "note that if we follow i.e. @xcite who find @xmath40 ( excluded at 2@xmath41 with our fits , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we would get much larger zgl corrections for the same @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( see the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr : sfr_fdf_goods ] and the discussion below ) .",
    "finally , following @xcite we derive the sfr by scaling the uv luminosity densities : @xmath42 in units of @xmath43 , where the constant is computed for a salpeter imf .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath44 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr : sfr_fdf_goods ] as a function of redshift .",
    "errors are computed from monte carlo simulations that take into account the probability distributions of photometric redshifts and the poissonian error @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that dust extinction does not evolve with redshift and is about a factor of @xmath45 in the rest - frame uv .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the role of dust will be given in a future paper , like an analysis based on the sfr derived at 2800  .",
    "thanks to the large area covered and the faint limiting magnitudes probed , our determination of the sfr is the most precise to date , with statistical errors less than 0.1 dex for the single redshift bins spanning the range @xmath46 .",
    "the considerations of  [ sec_photometry ] translate in the following conclusions about the sfr .",
    "out to redshift @xmath32 the sfrs derived from the i and b selected fdf , or the merged i+b catalogue , are identical within the errors ( @xmath4 dex ; see plot at the bottom left of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr : sfr_fdf_goods ] ) . at larger redshifts",
    "the b - selected sfrs underestimate the true values , since b drop - outs are not taken into account . the strong evolution in both the @xmath33 and @xmath47 parameters of the schechter lf measured as a function of redshift by @xcite results in a nearly constant sfr , because the strong brightening of @xmath33 is compensated by the dramatic decrease of @xmath47 with @xmath0 .",
    "comparing the two lower panels of shows that luminous galaxies ( @xmath7 ) contribute only a third of the total sfr at all observed @xmath0 , independent of the selection band .",
    "the k - selected sfrs are similar in shape , but systematically lower by @xmath5 dex at @xmath48 .",
    "this result holds independently of our completeness correction .",
    "if we consider only the contributions to the sfr down to the limiting magnitude set by the k - band , we find the same 0.2 dex difference for @xmath49 , and 0.15 dex at @xmath50 .",
    "[ fig : sfr : cont_absmag_fdf_goods ] shows that this result originates from the lower density of @xmath51 galaxies in the k - selected catalogue , as intermediate and low luminosity blue galaxies contributing to the sfr budget are more easily detected in the bluer bands than in k. in fact , the contributions to the sfr coming from the galaxies brighter than @xmath52 are identical within the errors for the i and k selected catalogues ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr : sfr_fdf_goods ] , bottom - right panel ) .",
    "therefore , cosmic variance does not play a role , as we also verified by comparing the b - band number counts in the 2 fields .",
    "they agree within 0.1 dex , which is the expected variation derived by @xcite scaled to the area of the goods - south field . on the other hand , @xcite",
    "show that the i - band fdf catalogue might be missing only about 10  % of the galaxies that would be detected in a deep k - band selected survey with magnitude limit @xmath53 ( like in * ? ? ?",
    ". the missing galaxies would be faint and likely not contributing significantly to the sfr provided their dust extinction is not exceedingly large .",
    "independent of the selection band the sfr declines beyond @xmath54 .",
    "our results confirm the conjecture of @xcite that the k - selected uv lfs match the optically selected lfs at high luminosities .",
    "the comparison with the literature shows that our results are dex lower , independent of the selection band .",
    "this difference stems from the large completeness corrections applied by , e.g. , @xcite , derived from the steep slopes fitted to the lf ( see  [ sec_photometry ] ) .",
    "our results scale to the literature values if similar slopes are used for the same @xmath33 and @xmath47 .",
    "this is shown by the dotted lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr : sfr_fdf_goods ] , where we have assumed a slope of @xmath55 for our data set while keeping @xmath33 and @xmath47 the same as in our fit .",
    "the overall agreement between the sfrs derived over a wide wavelength range ( within 0.2 dex ) , from the optical b and i to the nir k , sampling at @xmath12 the rest - frame uv and b , shows that we are approaching ( in the optical ) the complete census of the galaxies contributing to the stellar production of the universe up to this redshift .",
    "therefore , we can expect possible biases induced by missing stellar energy distributions with redshift @xcite to be small , when deep enough optical or nir catalogues are available .",
    "however , we might still not take into account the possible contribution to the sfr coming from faint , highly dust - absorbed red star - forming galaxies @xcite which are likely missing from optically or near - infrared selected samples .",
    "nevertheless , it is encouraging to find that recent spitzer results ( e.g. @xcite ) indicate that the majority of the star formation has already been accounted for using the dust - corrected sfr derived from optical studies .",
    "we have measured the sfr of the universe out to @xmath1 with unprecedented accuracy from the fors deep field and the goods - south field ( @xmath56 arcmin@xmath20 in total ) .",
    "our main conclusions are : + @xmath57 the cosmic variance in the sfr history between the fdf and goods - south field is negligibly small .",
    "the difference between these fields is @xmath4 dex , consistent with theoretical expectations .",
    "+ @xmath57 the sfr of galaxies brighter than @xmath52 is the same ( @xmath4 dex ) in b , i , ( i+b ) and k selected catalogues .",
    "this indicates that present optical and nir surveys are unlikely to have missed a substantial fraction population of massive star forming objects ( with the possible exception of heavily dust - enshrouded starbursts ) .",
    "+ @xmath57 the total sfr integrated over all galaxy luminosities is the same in the b , i , and ( i+b ) selected catalogues and is lower in the k - selected catalogue by 0.2 dex .",
    "this difference originates at luminosities lower than @xmath58 which implies that k - selected surveys miss a significant fraction of star - forming lower - luminosity galaxies .",
    "+ @xmath57 at all redshifts , luminous galaxies ( @xmath7 ) contribute only @xmath8 to the total sfr , i.e. the integrated sfr of @xmath6 galaxies is a factor of @xmath59 higher than the one of @xmath7 galaxies .",
    "+ @xmath57 our fits to the fdf luminosity functions suggest a flat faint - end slope of @xmath60 in contrast to the assumed slope of @xmath61 in the literature .",
    "this implies that past determinations have overestimated the sfr by a factor 2 .",
    "+ @xmath57 the sfr is approximately constant over the redshift range @xmath62 and drops by about 50% around @xmath63 , if dust corrections constant with redshift are assumed .",
