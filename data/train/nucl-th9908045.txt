    "the details of the model can be found in refs .",
    "it leads to chiral symmetry breaking and confinement ; furthermore , at large momenta , our effective interaction reduces to the perturbative running coupling and thus preserves the one - loop renormalization group behavior of qcd and reproduces perturbative results in the ultraviolet region .",

    "it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ wtid ] ) that the bare vertex @xmath20 is a bad approximation if the quark self - energy is momentum dependent as is realistically the case . for qcd modeling of electromagnetic coupling to hadrons",

    "the solution for the four longitudinal amplitudes agrees perfectly with the bc ansatz , as required by the wti .",
    "our transverse solution agrees with the bc ansatz only at spacelike asymptotic momenta . at low @xmath25",
    "it departs significantly from this ansatz ; although there is necessarily agreement at the point , the @xmath26-dependence of the dse solution is much larger than that of the bc ansatz . near the @xmath1 pole",

    "the strict vmd picture is too simple ; at least 40% of @xmath0 arises from the non - resonant photon coupling to the quark substructure of the pion .",
