    "the interest in the chiral abelian higgs model in 1 + 1 dimensions lies in the fact that it shares some properties with the electroweak theory , but is much simpler and may serve as a toy model .",
    "one of the most interesting common features of the two gauge theories is the fermionic number non - conservation @xcite . both give rise to instanton transitions , leading to the creation of a net fermion number due to an anomaly @xcite .",
    "both theories contain finite temperature sphaleron transitions @xcite - @xcite .    at zero temperature , zero fermionic chemical potentials and for a small number of particles participating in the reaction",
    ", the probability of the process can be computed using semi - classical methods . in general , the result is a product of the exponential of the classical action @xmath0 and the fluctuation determinants .",
    "the latter factor includes the small perturbations of the fields around the instanton configuration , and in many cases may only be computed numerically .",
    "quite a number of computations of determinants in 1 + 1 dimensions can be found in the literature . in particular , the determinants have been calculated for the vector and scalar field fluctuations around the instanton in @xcite , as well as for the fermionic ones in @xcite , where it was assumed that fermions have no mass term and no interaction with the higgs field . however , to our best knowledge , no computations incorporating the yukawa coupling of the fermions to scalar field have been done till now , neither for realistic case of electroweak theory nor for the chiral abelian higgs model .",
    "the aim of the present work is to partially fill this gap , calculating the fermionic determinant in the 1 + 1 dimensional case , where the fermions interact with the higgs field in a similar way as in the electroweak theory .",
    "this calculation is somewhat delicate because of the difficulties occurring in regularization and renormalization of chiral gauge models beyond perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , an analytic solution to this problem can not be obtained , since even the classical instanton profile , given by the nielsen - olesen string solution @xcite , is not known analytically , apart from the special case where the higgs mass equals the vector field mass @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we use analytical methods as long as possible before moving on to numerical computation .",
    "we will use a numerical method developed in @xcite , extended to our case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the model and its basic features , such as its vacuum structure , anomaly ,",
    "instanton configuration and fermionic zero modes are discussed . in section 3",
    ", we study and compare the 1-loop divergences occurring in this model in various regularization schemes . in section 4 , the method of @xcite to calculate determinants is discussed and applied to our case . in section 5",
    "we present in some detail the numerical procedures and give the results of the determinant computation .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section 6 .",

    "we use the majorana representation for the @xmath10-matrices : @xmath11 note that we do not reduce generality in considering yukawa interaction between identical fermions only but the matrix @xmath12 can always be diagonalized and made real trough redefinition of the fields @xmath5 . ] . in principle",
    "another mass term of the form @xmath13 could be added to the lagangian ( [ lm ] ) .",
    "it is compatible with gauge and lorentz invariance but breaks fermion number explicitly .",
    "as we are interested in instanton mediated fermion number non - conservation , we will not consider this term .",
    "this model has been studied as a toy model for the fermionic number non - conservation in the electroweak theory in a number of papers , see , e.g. @xcite-@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the particle spectrum consists of a higgs field with mass @xmath14 , a vector boson of mass @xmath15 , and @xmath4 dirac fermions acquiring a mass @xmath16 via yukawa coupling .",

    "( see for example @xcite ) , the dirac operator in the background of the instanton satisfies the following relation : @xmath53-\\dim\\ker[k^\\dagger]=n$ ] .",

    "we discuss its regularization and renormalization .",
    "for perturbative calculations , the dimensional regularization is best suited . however , as has been observed in @xcite , it is not applicable to the computation of the fermionic determinant because the continuation of the instanton fields to a space with fractional number of dimensions is not uniquely defined .",
