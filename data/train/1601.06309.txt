    "an accelerated expansion of the universe was confirmed by observations of the redshift of type ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . to explain the acceleration of the universe one can introduce the cosmological constant , @xmath1 , in the einstein equation with the unusual equation of state @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the pressure and the energy density , respectively ) .",
    "the fluid with such a property is called dark energy ( de ) . from the theoretical point of view , it is difficult to make such an introduction of @xmath1 clear . another way to describe de is to consider a scalar field ( quintessence ) with the proper potential which drives the universe to accelerate . the nature of the scalar field and its potential are also not easily understood .",
    "there are attempts to modify gravity by the replacement of the ricci scalar @xmath5 in the einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action by some function @xmath6 [ @xmath6 gravity models ] @xcite to explain the universe acceleration .",
    "there are many @xmath6 gravity models and there are not derivations of definite functions @xmath6 from first principles . at the same time cosmological models exploring nonlinear electrodynamics ( nle ) may solve problems of early time inflation and singularities without the modification of general relativity ( gr ) . some nle models , which are effective models that take into account quantum corrections , do not have divergences and possess finite self - energy of charge particles .",
    "some examples are the maxwell lagrangian plus the heisenberg - euler lagrangian @xcite taking into account one - loop qed quantum corrections and the born - infeld theory @xcite , that can be used for strong electromagnetic fields , smoothing divergences .",
    "the electromagnetic and gravitational fields in the early epoch are very strong , and therefore , the nonlinear electromagnetic effects should be taken into consideration .",
    "nle models can mimic de near the planck era and give inflation of the early universe .",
    "the magnetic fields in the early universe epoch may be in the order of @xmath7 g and classical electrodynamics has to be modified @xcite .",
    "the maxwell theory can be considered as an approximation of nle theory for weak fields and for strong fields we should use spacetimes with nle fields .",
    "thus , nle has been used to produce inflation in the early universe @xcite , @xcite , and it is a source of the universe acceleration @xcite - @xcite . the coupling nle with gravity may give negative pressure that drives the universe to accelerate @xcite - @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we explore a new nle model @xcite so that the electromagnetic field is coupled to the gravitational field .",
    "we investigate the evolution of the universe in the einstein - nle model which prevents the initial big bang singularity .",
    "gr can be treated as an effective field theory at low energy of quantum gravity theory , and the eh classical action should have the trace anomaly of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "the result of breaking the scale invariance in nle gives the negative pressure .",
    "we use units with @xmath8 and the metric @xmath9 .",
    "greek letters run @xmath10 and latin letters run @xmath11 .",
    "we will study the dynamics of the universe with the energy density ( 14 ) and neglect the dustlike matter using einstein s equations .",
    "we make a conclusion from eq .",
    "( 9 ) that at the critical value ( @xmath54 ) of the scale factor , @xmath55 , the universe acceleration is zero .",
    "the evolution of the scale factor can be studied by analyzing the second friedmann equation without the cosmological constant @xmath56 where @xmath57 corresponds to three - dimensional flat universe and @xmath58 - for closed and @xmath59 - for open universes , respectively .",
    "equation ( 19 ) may be represented with the help of eq .",
    "( 14 ) as @xmath60 where @xmath61 equation ( 20 ) is similar to an equation describing one - dimensional motion of a particle in the potential @xmath62 with the energy @xmath63 .",
    "the potential function ( 21 ) is negative and possesses a maximum at @xmath64 .",
    "let us consider the case of three - dimensional flat space , @xmath57",
    ". in this case , eq .",
    "( 20 ) can be integrated , and the result is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a constant of integration .",
    "it is obvious to use the solution in eq .",
    "( 22 ) with the sign ( @xmath67 ) in the right side of ( 22 ) when the scale factor increases in the time .",
    "it should be noted that solution ( 22 ) for large @xmath68 gives , @xmath69 , the same behavior of the scale factor as for the radiation era in maxwell s theory . in the early evolution for the small cosmic time",
    ", the dependence of the scale factor on the time becomes almost exponential as follows from eq .",
    "( 22 ) because nonlinear corrections to the maxwell theory are essential .",
    "the constant @xmath66 gives only the shift in the time and can be neglected .",
    "the plot of the function @xmath70 vs @xmath71 for @xmath72 is given in fig . 1 .",
    "the function @xmath73 vs @xmath74.,width=384,height=384 ]    at @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , we get from ( 22 ) [ at @xmath72 and using @xmath67 in the right side of ( 22 ) ] the equation for the radius of the universe @xmath77 : @xmath78 the solution to the transcendental eq .",
    "( 23 ) is @xmath79 .",
    "thus , there is not singularity at the cosmic time @xmath75 . as @xmath80 ,",
    "the universe undergos the acceleration expansion . in accordance with the graph",
    ", the universe accelerates till the time when @xmath81 ( @xmath55 ) . at @xmath81 ,",
    "the acceleration stops , and the value @xmath82 holds corresponding to the time @xmath83 . after this time , the universe decelerates .",
    "thus , in the toy model we suggest , one can explain inflation and the early time acceleration and avoid singularities at the beginning of the universe creation .",
    "one of the criteria for cosmological models to survive is that the speed of the sound is less that the local light speed , i.e. @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "another criterion requires that the square sound speed is positive , @xmath85 . in this case",
    "there is no a classical instability . from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , we obtain the square sound speed ( at @xmath86 ) @xmath87 one can verify that the inequality @xmath84 takes place ( @xmath88 ) for any value of the magnetic induction field @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the cosmological model under consideration does not admit superluminal fluctuations and meets the required bound @xmath84 .",
    "the requirement that the energy density perturbations do not uncontrollably grow leads to a classical stability , @xmath85 , @xmath90 according to eq .",
    "( 25 ) , the scale factor has to obey the bound @xmath91 to possess a classical stability . at this stage",
    ", the universe undergoes the deceleration because the acceleration stops at @xmath92 . as a result",
    ", we have a classical instability only during the period when @xmath93 , i.e. during the inflation and a short time period of the universe deceleration .",
    "after , at @xmath91 , the energy density perturbations do not grow .",
    "a new model of nonlinear electromagnetic fields with a dimensional parameter @xmath0 coupled to gr , when the nonlinear electromagnetic field is the source of the gravitational field , has been considered .",
    "the scale invariance in this model is broken , and the trace of the energy - momentum tensor is nonzero .",
    "the nonlinear electromagnetic field possesses a finite value @xmath13 at the origin of charged particles .",
    "some of the important problems in cosmology are the initial singularity and the accelerated expansion .",
    "we have considered electromagnetic fields as a stochastic background with the nonzero value @xmath94 .",
    "it has been shown that the universe undergos inflation and the accelerated expansion .",
    "we show the absence of singularities at the beginning of the universe creation , in the energy density , in the curvature , in the ricci tensor squared , and in the kretschmann scalar .",
    "the magnetic universe is considered so that the magnetic field drives the universe to accelerate because we modified linear equations for the electromagnetic fields to be nonlinear equations .",
    "after some time , the universe decelerates , approaching the minkowski spacetime asymptotically .",
    "it was demonstrated that the speed of the sound is less than the local light speed ; i.e. the causality takes place .",
    "a classical stability holds at the deceleration phase when @xmath91 .",
    "homogeneous and isotropic cosmology with nonlinear electromagnetic radiation has been studied .",
    "thus , in the cosmological model with nle under consideration , the magnetic field allows the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "we presented here a model of nle fields coupled to gravity which allows us to consider the universe evolution in accordance with the scenario of modern cosmology .",
    "let us consider frw spacetime with the flat spatial part with the line element @xmath95 possessing the metric tensor elements @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a scale factor .",
    "the standard calculations of nonzero components of the christoffel symbols @xcite @xmath98 give ( @xmath99 ) @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the curvature tensor is given by @xcite @xmath102 having the symmetry @xmath103 from eqs .",
