    "it is generally believed that the gravitational clustering of scale free initial perturbations is self - similar ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) .",
    "the statistical descriptions of large scale structures , such as correlation functions and number densities , show somewhat of a scaling behavior . among various observed objects ,",
    "clusters probably are the best for studying this gravitational scaling , because their distribution and clustering are dominated by gravitation and less  contaminated \" by hydro processes .",
    "therefore , observed clusters can directly be identified as massive halos of n - body simulation samples .",
    "a multi - scale identification of clusters will be useful to reveal the expected scaling .",
    "traditionally , clusters are identified from either observed or simulated distribution of galaxies or masses within a sphere of given radius @xmath2 , say , the frequently adopted abell radius @xmath10 mpc where @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 .",
    "however , _ a priori _ choice of @xmath2 is somewhat arbitrary , or dependent on observational limits .",
    "clusters have already been identified and studied on very different radius @xmath2 .",
    "for example , a wide range of radius covering from 0.01 - 4.3 @xmath13 mpc has been used in the current determination of cluster masses ( e.g. wu & fang 1996 , 1997a and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , a multi - scale identification of clusters is a necessary extension of the  standard \" abell radius @xmath10 mpc .",
    "it will provide information , such as the scale invariance of the mass functions of clusters , which can not be seen by one scale identification .",
    "this is the goal of this paper .",
    "as we know , cluster study has been significant for understanding the nature and evolution of cosmic structures on scales of @xmath14 1 - 10 mpc . in particular ,",
    "cosmological parameters can be well constrained by the observed properties of clusters , such as the abundances and correlations ( bahcall & cen 1992 ( bc ) ; jing et al .",
    "1993 ; jing & fang 1994 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; carlberg et al . 1997a ; bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ) , the substructures ( jing _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , the luminosity - temperature relations ( oukbir & blanchard 1997 ) and the gravitational lensing phenomena ( wu & fang 1996 ; wu et al .",
    "we believe that the multi - scale identification of clusters and the scaling invariance would be able to add more constraints on relevant parameters .    in  2 ,",
    "we summarize the theoretical background of the possible scaling of the multi - scale identified clusters . in  3 , we present the result of identifying clusters on different scales in three popular structure formation models : 1 ) the standard cold dark matter model ( scdm ) , 2 ) low density , flat cdm model with a non - zero @xmath15 ( lcdm ) , and 3 ) open cdm model ( ocdm ) . using these samples",
    ", we show that the mass functions of rich clusters are scaling invariant . in  4 , the predictions of scaling are compared with observations of clusters identified from iras sample . in  5 ,",
    "the index of the scaling is detected from samples of x - ray and gravitational lensing clusters with mass estimates .",
    "finally , we describe our main findings in  6 .",
    "it is generally believed that cosmic gravitational clustering after the decoupling can roughly be described by three rgimes : 1 .",
    "linear regime ; 2 .",
    "quasilinear regime which is dominated by scale - invariant radial infall ; and 3 .",
    "fully developed nonlinear regime dominated by virialized nonradial motion . since the amplitudes of the cosmic temperature fluctuations revealed by cobe are as small as @xmath16 ( bennett et al .",
    "1996 ) , the gravitational clustering should remain in the linear regime , or at most in the quasilinear regime , on comoving scales larger than about 10 @xmath13 mpc and at redshifts higher than 2 . on the other hand , observations indicate that clusters of galaxies with size of about 1.5 h@xmath12 mpc are probably the largest fully developed or virialized objects .",
    "thus , the quasilinear evolution should be substantial on the scales from about 2 to 10 h@xmath12 mpc .",
    "obviously , these facts are useful for discriminating among models of structure formation .",
    "because different regime generally has different behavior of scaling , an effective way of doing model discrimination would be to compare the model predicted scaling with observations .    in linear regime",
    ", the scaling is straightforward .",
    "if the primeval density perturbations are gaussian and have power law spectrum @xmath17 , the variance of the initial mass fluctuation within a spherical region on length scale @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 . therefore , there is a scaling of @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . since @xmath22 is a statistical average with respect to @xmath23 , the number density of radius @xmath18 halo with mass from @xmath1 to @xmath24 , the scaling of @xmath22 indicates the scaling of the number density as @xmath25 = n(>m , r)\\ ] ] where @xmath26 which is the accumulative number density of radius r halo with mass larger than m.    since @xmath18 is the initial radius of the halos , not the radius @xmath2 of the developed halos , the scaling eq.(1 ) can not be directly tested by observed halos . only in the stage of linear regime ,",
    "the scale of halos @xmath27 , we have then scaling relationship as @xmath28 = n(>m , r_{cl})\\ ] ] where scaling index @xmath29 , subscript @xmath30 is for linear regime .",
    "namely , the scaling index @xmath4 is a function of @xmath31 , or it is model - dependent .    beyond linear regime , the existence of scaling behavior of gravitational clustering can be shown by comparing the gravitational clustering of cosmic matter with the evolution of the profile of a growing interface , or surface roughing .",
    "the later is described by the so - called kpz equation ( kardar , parisi & zhang 1986 ) , which mainly consists of terms of nonlinear evolution and stochastic force , or stochastic initial perturbations .",
    "a major breakthrough in this approach has been to show the existence of universal scaling properties of the surface growth by the dynamical renormalization group ( barabsi & stanley 1995 ) ) .",
    "it has been found that the equations describing the evolution of cosmic density perturbations are essentially kpz - like ( berera & fang 1994 ) . the equations of cosmic gravitational clustering contains the similar nonlinear term and a stochastic initial perturbations .",
    "the gravitational potential of cosmic matter plays the similar role as the height @xmath32 of the surface .",
    "thus , the structure formation in the universe substantially is also a phenomena of structural  surface \" growth : an initially flat or smooth 3-dimension surface described by the robertson - walker metric evolved into a roughen one .",
    "consequently , the cosmic gravitational clustering should also show the scaling feature as the kpz - like surface growths .",
    "the scaling of a kpz - like surface is given by @xmath33 , where @xmath30 is the length of the coarse - grained average ; @xmath34 is time .",
    "the function @xmath35 is @xmath36 when @xmath37 is small , and @xmath38 const .",
    "when @xmath37 is large ( vicsek 1992 ) .",
    "the scaling indexes @xmath39 and @xmath40 depend on the indexes of the spectrum of the stochastic force or the initial perturbations on the surface . because @xmath2 is , in fast , the scale of a coarse - grained average of mass field of the universe , we have @xmath41 since the scaling indexes @xmath4 and @xmath42 depend on the indexes of the power spectrum of the initial perturbations , they are model - dependent .    from eq.(4 ) one can generally conclude the existence of scaling during quasilinear and non - linear regimes .",
    "the scaling is characterized by 1 . ) for small scale @xmath2 and/or longer ( later ) time @xmath34 , the coarse - grained mass distributions have scaling @xmath43 ; 2 . ) for larger @xmath2 and/or earlier time @xmath34 , the mass distribution will deviate from the @xmath4 scaling .",
    "because larger @xmath2 and earlier time @xmath34 corresponds to quasilinear regime , the deviation from @xmath4-scaling should be due to the difference between the scaling behaviors of the quasilinear and non - linear regimes .",
    "the indexes @xmath4 and @xmath42 are initial - perturbation dependent .",
    "thus , one can expect that the @xmath4-scaling and the deviation from this scaling are useful for discriminating among models of structure formation .",
    "these general conclusions are illustrated by some semi - analytical approaches .",
    "for instance , with the assumption of  stable clustering \" , the index @xmath44 of the two - point correlation function @xmath45 at the fully developed non - linear regime is found to be @xmath46 ( peebles 1965 ) .",
    "this turns to @xmath47 ( pandmanabhan & engineer 1998 ) .",
    "this means that the @xmath4-scaling of highly virialized halos is indeed dependent on the initial density perturbations .    as for the deviation from the @xmath4-scaling",
    ", one can refer to the power transfer via mode coupling in quasilinear regime .",
    "it has been found that for cdm - like spectrum , the power transfer of density perturbations is from large scales to small ones ( e.g. suto & sasaki 1991 ) .",
    "this is , the larger scale perturbations relatively have higher power in the quasilinear regime than fully developed non - linear regime .",
    "therefore , the index @xmath4 in quasilinear regime will generally be larger than that of non - linear regime .",
    "thus , one can predict that the index @xmath4 should show a  going up \" on larger scales .",
    "this conclusion can also be illustrated by spherical in - fall model .",
    "using scale - invariant spherical in - fall approximation , it has been shown that an initial scaling of @xmath48 may lead to a scaling of @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 , which is larger than the @xmath4 given by  stable clustering \" .",
    "therefore , the scaling index in the quasilinear regime is larger than that of non - linear regime ( padmanabhan 1996 ) .    despite these semi - analytical results are consistent with the scenario of kpz - like dynamical scaling in general",
    ", it is difficult to semi - analytically calculate the accurate relation between the scaling index and various initial perturbations .",
    "one can not test models by the scaling index calculated from assumptions like the  stable clustering \" or spherical in - fall .",
    "the studies of surface growth has shown that in the case of 3-d one can not find the index of dynamical scaling analytically ( vicsek 1992 ) . to find the number of the scaling , and to test models by this scaling",
    ", numerical study is necessary .",
    "this motivated us to investigate the dynamical scaling of the gravitational clustering numerically .",
    "in order to study the mass functions of clusters at different scales , we have performed n - body simulations with the p@xmath52 m code ( jing & fang 1994 ; jing et al .",
    "1995 ; wu et al .",
    "1997b ) for models of the scdm , lcdm and ocdm . the cosmological parameters ( @xmath53 ) are taken to be ( 1.0,0.0,0.5,0.62 ) , ( 0.3,0.7,0.75,1.0 ) , ( 0.3,0.0,0.75,1.0 ) for the scdm , lcdm and ocdm , respectively .",
    "the models with these parameters seem to provide a good approximation to many observational properties of the universe , especially the abundance of clusters ( e.g. jing & fang 1994 ; bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ) .    the simulation parameters , including box size @xmath30 , number of particles @xmath54 and the effective force resolution @xmath55 , are chosen to be ( @xmath30,@xmath54,@xmath56 mpc , @xmath57 mpc ) .",
    "we have run 8 realizations for each model .",
    "a particle has mass of @xmath58m@xmath59 , which is small enough to resolve reliably the rich clusters with @xmath60 m@xmath59 .    to effectively identify clusters with different comoving radius , we havent employed the traditional friends - of - friends algorithm , but instead developed an algorithm based on the discrete wavelet transformation ( dwt ) ( see  a1 of appendix ) .",
    "the details of the dwt identification of clusters will be reported separately ( xu , fang & deng , 1998 ) . briefly , we first describe the distribution of the particles by a 3-d matrix , and then do fast 3-d _ daubechies 4 _ dwt and the reversed transformations to find the wavelet function coefficients ( wfcs ) and scaling function coefficients ( sfcs ) on various scales . for each scale ,",
    "the cells with sfcs larger than those of the random sample by a given statistical significance are picked up as cluster candidates . around each of the candidates , we place a @xmath61 grid with the size of cluster diameter and",
    "search for the accurate center .",
    "the cluster center is taken as the position with largest mass surrounded .",
    "the mass is measured by counting the particles within a sphere of radius @xmath2 , the volume of which is the same as the cells . whenever two clusters are closer than 2@xmath2 , the cluster with smaller @xmath1 is deleted from the list .",
    "we iterate the above steps for particles which have not been listed as cluster members until no further clusters are found",
    ". we will call clusters identified by radius @xmath2 as @xmath2-clusters . since the dwt technique treats the identification at different @xmath2 in a uniform way , it is suitable to study the @xmath2-dependence of clusters .    fig .",
    "1 shows the derived cluster mass function @xmath0 , which is the number density of clusters with mass larger than @xmath1 within radius @xmath2 .",
    "for all the three models the mass functions of @xmath62mpc clusters given by the dwt method are found to be in good agreement with those derived from friends - of - friends identification ( jing & fang 1994 ) . at higher @xmath40 , these two methods , the friends - of - friends and dwt , also provide the same mass functions for @xmath62mpc clusters .",
    "it turns out that the dwt technique of identifying clusters is indeed reliable .",
    "this algorithm can also be applied to real samples of galaxy distribution .",
    "since the number densities of galaxies in real samples are much less than those of particles of n - body simulation samples , sampling error may lead to some false identification of poor clusters .",
    "however , for rich clusters , the effect of sampling error is small .    since in",
    "our identified sample each cluster is characterized by two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it is inconvenient to define richness by mass alone . instead",
    ", the relative richness can be defined by number density .",
    "this is , clusters with mass @xmath63 and scale @xmath64 are considered to have the same richness as clusters with @xmath65 and @xmath66 if @xmath67 . in this paper , the number density @xmath31 is expressed as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the mean separation of the clusters .",
    "therefore , clusters with @xmath70 mpc)@xmath71 correspond to rich clusters of @xmath72 m@xmath59 on scale @xmath10 mpc for scdm at z=0 .",
    "it can be easily seen from fig .",
    "1 that all the mass functions on various scales have a similar shape .",
    "this is , if the 1.5 @xmath13 mpc mass functions are shifted horizontally along @xmath1-axis , they can approximately coincide with the mass functions of @xmath73 and 12 @xmath13 mpc clusters , respectively .",
    "especially , a good match is found in the range of abundances lower than , or richness higher than , 1 ( 50 @xmath13 mpc)@xmath71 .",
    "this similarity can indeed be described by a scale invariance of the abundance mentioned in  2 @xmath74 \\simeq n(>m , r_0)\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the index of the scaling .",
    "eq.(5 ) indicates that the number density of halos ( clusters ) having masses @xmath75 within radius @xmath76 is the same as that of halos having masses @xmath77 within @xmath2 .",
    "we have tested eq.(5 ) by calculating @xmath4 for @xmath0 in the abundance range of @xmath78 mpc)@xmath71 , and found that @xmath4 remains roughly to be a constant within @xmath79 in the radius range @xmath80 mpc when @xmath81 mpc .",
    "the scale - invariance is conveniently expressed by a mass - radius scaling which is the solution of the following equation : @xmath82=n[>m(1.5),1.5]\\ ] ] where 1.5 denotes @xmath10 mpc .",
    "if eq.(5 ) is correct , we will have @xmath83 ( in this paper , we denote m from scaling by @xmath84 , the mass within r by @xmath85 . )    in fig .",
    "2 , we plot @xmath86 $ ] against @xmath87 from the solution of eq.(6 ) for the three models , in which the  richness \" is taken to be @xmath88=1 ( 90 h^{-1}$ ] mpc)@xmath71 .",
    "the loci of @xmath86 $ ] vs. @xmath87 can be fairly well approximated by straight lines in the range of @xmath89 mpc .",
    "especially , for the lcdm the relation of @xmath86 $ ] - @xmath87 is quite straight in this range .",
    "for scdm and ocdm they also do not deviate too much from straight lines .",
    "therefore , the slopes of these lines , or @xmath4 s , nearly remain constant in the radius range @xmath89 mpc and  richness \" range @xmath90 \\leq 1 ( 50 h^{-1}$ ] mpc)@xmath71 .",
    "the straight line fitting yields @xmath91 for lcdm and ocdm , while @xmath92 for scdm .",
    "2 shows that all curves @xmath86$]-@xmath87 are going up around @xmath93 mpc .",
    "in other words , the index @xmath4 becomes larger in the range of @xmath94 mpc .",
    "this is qualitatively in good agreement with the behavior of the scaling predicted in last section . as the gravitation clustering on scales larger than @xmath95 mpc probably still partially remains of infall evolution",
    ", the scaling index is affected by the quasilinear evolution , and higher than that on scales less than @xmath95mpc .",
    "indeed , on such large scales , more and more @xmath96-identified halos do nt have dense virialized cores in their centers , but are with complicated and irregular shapes , one of which is illustrated in the fig .",
    "1 of jing and fang ( 1994 ) .",
    "we also find that the  going up \" behavior of the scaling index @xmath4 is more significant at the quasilinear regime at earlier times .",
    "a similar result can also be seen in the comparison of universal profile with n - body simulation on larger scale ( diaferio & geller , 1997 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the mass density profiles of regular clusters may universally be fitted by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is proportional to the virialized radius of clusters .",
    "both @xmath99 and @xmath98 are in unit of @xmath100 , the radius where the average interior density is 200 times higher than the critical density of the universe ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) . in the range of @xmath101",
    ", the universal mass profile can be approximated as a power law @xmath102 obviously , the index @xmath103 depends on the fitting of developed virialized core with @xmath98 ( carlberg et al .",
    "1997b ) .",
    "eq.(8 ) looks very similar to eq.(7 ) .",
    "however , we should not identify the index @xmath103 with @xmath4 , because @xmath2 in eq.(7 ) is the scale used to identify clusters , while @xmath99 in eq.(8 ) is the radius of each cluster .",
    "@xmath103 will be the same as @xmath4 only if clusters identified by different @xmath2 have the same mass density profile .",
    "3 shows , however , a systematic difference of mass density profile of clusters with different @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the larger the scale , the larger the systematic difference .",
    "this is because the clusters identified by large @xmath2 are still partially in the quasilinear regime for which the halos are pre - virialized .",
    "halos , which lack a virialized core in their centers , can not be described by the universal density profile .",
    "it should be pointed out that an original meaning of the  universal \" is the independence of profile on the initial condition , i.e. , @xmath103 is a universal number regardless the parameters of initial spectrum like the index @xmath31 .",
    "namely , all initial parameters are forgotten in the late time ( non - linear regime ) clustering . theoretically , it is far from clear of the condition under which the late time profiles do not remember the initial condition .",
    "at least , the assumption of the stable clustering can not co - exist with an initial - condition - independent profile ( pandmanabhan & engineer 1998 ) .",
    "3 shows that the mean profiles @xmath85 of clusters are significantly different for different models .",
    "namely , the late time profiles do remember the initial condition .",
    "we can directly test the scale invariance via eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) . to do this",
    ", we have applied the multi - scale dwt method to identify galaxy clusters in the redshift survey of the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) galaxies with flux limit of @xmath104 ( fisher et al .",
    "the iras surveys are uniform and complete down to galactic latitudes @xmath105 from the galactic plane .",
    "the 1.2 jy iras survey consists of 5313 galaxies , which cover 87.6% of sky , and with @xmath106 of the sky belonging to the so - called  excluded zones \" .",
    "we fill up the  excluded zones \" and holes with a randomly distributed galaxies , which are generated with the same mean number density , and the same radial ( redshift ) selection function as other areas .",
    "this treatment may lead to a little underestimate of the number density of clusters .",
    "however , in terms of the ratio between abundances of clusters on different scales the effect of  excluded zones \" is small .",
    "moreover , random data , like poisson distributions , may give rise to false statistics on order higher than second , but this problem will not be met in the statistics of abundance .    as usual , to reduce the effect of radial selection function , we divide the sample into a series of shells with thickness @xmath14 2500 km s@xmath12 in redshift space , and measure the number count functions @xmath107 in three shells of @xmath108 : [ 2500 - 5000 ] , [ 5000 - 7500 ] and [ 7500 - 10000 ] km s@xmath12 .",
    "there are only few galaxies beyond 10000 km s@xmath12 .",
    "they are not suitable for studying the scaling of the cluster abundance .    with these redshift shells",
    "@xmath109 the density field @xmath110 can be reconstructed by a 2-d dwt decomposition with bases @xmath111 as @xmath112 where the wfcs @xmath113 can be found from the galaxy distribution of the sample ( a2 appendix ) .",
    "since the wavelet bases @xmath114 are orthogonal and complete , the density field @xmath115 is the same as descriptions by other orthogonal - complete decomposition , say the bases of spherical harmonics and bessel functions ( fisher et al .",
    "it has been shown that the power spectrum detected by the dwt is the same as that by a fourier decomposition ( pando & fang 1998 ) .",
    "the mass density given by the dwt is also the same as that of bessel - spherical harmonics .",
    "we choose the dwt bases only because it is easy to detect the @xmath116-dependence , or scale - dependence .",
    "we will use @xmath115 to identify clusters on various scales @xmath116 by the same way developed in  3.1 .",
    "similar to the n - body simulation , the cluster center is defined as the point around which a maximum number of galaxies are enclosed within a cylinder with length of 3000 km s@xmath12 and radius equal to that of the cluster . whenever two clusters are closer than 2@xmath2 , the cluster with smaller number of galaxies @xmath117 is deleted from the list .",

    "namely , the masses of clusters identified from the 1.2 jy iras samples are statistically the same as those of the clusters in the bc sample .",
    "this result is consistent with the following fact : the iras galaxies trace the local large scale structures .",
    "it has been found that many optically identified structures , including superclusters , voids , great attractor and abell clusters , have been identified from density field constructed from iras data ( webster , lahav & fisher 1997 ) .",
    "considering that the clusters of bc sample consist of optical and x - ray clusters , and the iras galaxies are biased , containing more later type galaxies , fig .",
    "4 indicates that the early - type galaxies map about the same mass field as late - type , despite the early - type galaxies are clustered more strongly than late - type galaxies .",
    "this is because that in terms of second order of statistics the segregation between the early and late - type galaxies is almost linear , and scale - independent at relatively large scales . using stromlo - apm redshift survey",
    "it has been shown that for second order statistics the scale - dependence of the segregation between early and late - type galaxies is not large than 1 @xmath134 in the range from 1 to 20 @xmath13 mpc ( loveday et al .",

    "they are indeed the same within error limit .",
    "thus , the mass functions @xmath131 from the shells of [ 2500 - 5000 ] and [ 7500 - 10000 ] kms@xmath12 are the same as [ 5000 - 7500 ] km s@xmath12 , and also the same as the bc sample . therefore , the number of @xmath123 provides a consistent @xmath136 conversion for the entire sample of the 1.2 jy iras galaxies . using the conversion of abell richness to cluster mass : @xmath137 m@xmath59 ( bahcall & cen 1993 ) , we have @xmath138 m@xmath59 gives @xmath139 .",
    "it means every count of the 1.2 jy iras galaxies ( after selection - function correction ) corresponds to about 7 times abell count of optical galaxies in counting the mass of a cluster .      because @xmath140 reaches a constant asymptotic value beyond @xmath141 mpc ( bahcall , lubin & dorman 1995 ) , and",
    "there is no evidence of significant scale dependence of bias factor of iras galaxies from 1 to 10 h@xmath12 mpc , the @xmath117-@xmath1 conversion eq.(12 ) should be applicable on scales @xmath142mpc .",
    "thus we can find mass functions @xmath143 from number - count functions @xmath107 of iras cluster with @xmath144mpc .",
    "using these iras @xmath0 , we test the scaling by eq.(6 ) .",
    "the solutions of eq.(6 ) for both iras data and simulation sample are shown in fig .",
    "5 . the theoretical curves in fig .",
    "5 are similar to fig",
    ". 2 , and the richness parameter is taken to be @xmath145 mpc)@xmath71 .    since only mass ratios @xmath146 of the solutions eq.(6 ) are plotted in fig . 5",
    ", the result does nt depend on the value of a. the effect of linear bias of galaxies will also be canceled in this ratio .",
    "the errors of iras data in fig .",
    "5 are calculated from both horizontal and vertical errors of the mass function ( fig .",
    "4 ) . since the mass function is very steep for rich clusters , i.e. @xmath147 , an uncertainty of @xmath148 will transfer to a relatively small uncertainty of @xmath149 . because the mean number density of 1.2 jy iras galaxies is low , the major source of errors in fig .",
    "5 is from poisson errors of the number of galaxies in clusters .    despite the errors are large , fig",
    "5 already shows that the iras data is basically consistent with the prediction : there is a scaling invariance in the range of @xmath150mpc with index @xmath5 , and the scaling index of scaling is  going up \" on larger scales .",
    "the results of simulation samples show that the index of scaling is model - dependent .",
    "the three panels of fig .",
    "5 generally are in agreement with the two low mass models ( lcdm and ocdm ) within 1 @xmath134 , but show a systematic disfavor of the scdm at @xmath151 .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "5 are slightly overestimated by assuming that the poisson errors of mass estimates between two scales are independent .",
    "they might be about @xmath152 times smaller if the two poisson errors are completely correlated ( cloud in cloud scenario ) .",
    "so , in each of the three shells the scdm is away from the data at the level of @xmath153 , or disfavored at a confidence level of @xmath154 .",
    "if all the shells are binned together , the confidence should certainly be higher than that of individual shell , because the poisson errors will be smaller . however , it is difficult to estimate the influence of the selection function .",
    "moreover , if spiral galaxies were underrepresented within about 1.5 @xmath13 mpc , the true values of the scaling index should be lower than that shown in fig . 5",
    ", i.e. it strengthens the conclusion of disfavoring the scdm .",
    "therefore , the number @xmath155 can be applied as a underestimated confidence level .",
    "similar to eq.(2 ) , the number density of @xmath2 clusters with mass in the range of @xmath1 to @xmath24 is @xmath156 one can then define a mean mass of @xmath2 clusters with richness @xmath157 by @xmath158 using eqs.(5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , we have @xmath159 this means , the index @xmath4 determined by fitting eq.(16 ) with a sample of mass measurements of clusters with richness @xmath157 should be the same as that given by abundance solution of eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "this prediction can be tested if we have fair samples of masses of clusters with richness @xmath157 and over a given radius range of @xmath2 .",
    "despite we still lack cluster mass samples covering a large radius range of @xmath2 and with the desired completeness , the current data are already able to preliminarily test the prediction eq.(16 ) .",
    "for instance , it is generally believed that the weak gravitational lensing clusters being studied are among the richest clusters .",
    "weak lensing mass estimate gives only a lower bound to the total cluster mass because of the unknown mean density in the so - called control annulus ( fahlman et al 1994 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the radius dependence of the cluster mass given by weak gravitational lensing , @xmath160 , is insensitive to the control field which contributes only a constant component to the mass distribution .",
    "moreover , under the isothermal assumption , we have @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the sight - of - line velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies .",
    "since the relation @xmath161 is independent of richness , a velocity dispersion normalized mass , @xmath163 , appears to be less dependent on richness .",
    "so , the cluster mass sample consisting of @xmath160 and velocity dispersion measurements would be good for fitting with eq.(16 ) .",
    "there are 9 clusters which have both velocity dispersion measurements and weak gravitational lensing mass @xmath164 estimates in the radius range of 0.15 to 2 @xmath13mpc ( wu & fang 1997a ) .",
    "although @xmath160 from the weak lensing actually corresponds to a projected mass within @xmath2 , the values of @xmath4 given by either the projection or the 3-d masses will be roughly the same at large radius @xmath165 mpc .",
    "a best fitting of this weak lensing data yields @xmath166 .",
    "another data set of rich cluster masses can be selected from x - ray measurements . the largest sample of x - ray clusters with mass estimates published to date is given by white , jones & forman ( 1998 ) , which contains 226 x - ray cluster masses for 207 clusters derived from a deprojection of einstein observatory x - ray imaging data .",
    "meanwhile , by extensively searching literature there are additional 152 x - ray determined cluster / group masses available .",
    "these data were obtained by either the similar approach to wjf ( e.g. white & fabian 1995 ; ettori , fabian & white 1998 ; etc . ) or the analysis of the rosat pspc x - ray observations ( e.g. pildis .",
    "et al 1995 ; david , jones & forman 1995 ; cirimele et al . 1997 ; etc . ) .",
    "all the available 144 measurements of cluster masses from x - ray observations with @xmath167mpc are plotted in fig .",
    "6 .    the x - ray and optical measurements of some gravitational lensing clusters",
    "have shown that the gravitational lensing clusters on average correspond to x - ray temperature @xmath168 kev and velocity dispersion of @xmath169 km s@xmath12 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to select richest clusters by the conditions of @xmath170 kev and @xmath171 km s@xmath12 .",
    "there are 11 measurements satisfying these conditions .",
    "these data are plotted as star - added circles in fig .",
    "it yields @xmath172 in the range of @xmath173mpc .",
    "it is interesting to see from fig . 6",
    "that the x - ray mass distribution has a clear upper envelope , and all the clusters selected by @xmath170 kev and @xmath171 km s@xmath12 distribute along the envelope .",
    "it implies that the clusters at the envelope are among the richest clusters at the given @xmath2 .",
    "recall that observations may easily lose less massive clusters , but tend to pick up the bright and massive ones .",
    "this selection effect is severe for producing a reliable sample of less rich clusters , but benefit to the completeness of sample of rich clusters .",
    "therefore , one can employ the envelope clusters to fit with eq.(16 ) . to this end",
    ", we have binned the data set of cluster masses into 8 logarithmic intervals according to radius from @xmath174mpc . within each bin",
    ", the mean value of the second and the third largest clusters is used as the envelope value .",
    "two of the 8 bins having less than 2 clusters are not considered as reliable measurements of the envelope and are thus not used .",
    "all envelope values are shown in fig .",
    "6 , in which the vertical error bars are the mass difference between the second and third masses of the most massive clusters .",
    "the least - square fitting gives @xmath175 in the radius range of 0.5 to 3 @xmath13mpc . to reduce the possible effect of the bin size selection , we re - calculated @xmath4 using different bin sizes .",
    "it turns out that differences among these results are not larger than @xmath176 .",
    "all the detections of eq.(16 ) with independent ensembles of rich cluster mass estimates have yielded the same number of @xmath4 within error limits . for clusters with ",
    "richness \" @xmath70 mpc)@xmath71 in the range of @xmath177 mpc the mean value of @xmath4 is @xmath178 .",
    "these values of @xmath4 basically agree with the @xmath4 detected by the abundance of iras clusters (  4.3 ) .",
    "therefore , current data are in good consistence with the scaling invariance of rich cluster abundance .",
    "as has been discussed in  2 , the scaling index @xmath4 remains as a constant on smaller scales and later time , but will show  going up \" on larger scales and early time on which the quasilinear evolution still plays important role .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the  going up \" behavior will be more significant at higher redshifts .",
    "an effective measure of the  going up \" is the abundance ratio @xmath179/n(>m , r_0)$ ] at higher redshifts .",
    "if the scaling invariance of abundance perfectly holds with a constant index @xmath4 , we have @xmath180}{n(>m , r_0 ) } = 1\\ ] ] therefore , the radius @xmath99 beyond which this ratio no longer remains equal to unity is a measure of the importance of the quasilinear evolution .",
    "7 plots the ratio @xmath179/n(>m , r_0)$ ] of simulated samples with parameters @xmath181 , @xmath81 mpc and @xmath182m@xmath59 . fig .",
    "7 shows that all the abundance ratios become larger than 1 on large scales .",
    "namely the real values of @xmath4 for the simulated samples are larger than the assumed 0.63 on larger scales .",
    "this is the  going up \" , indicating the deviation from constant @xmath4 .",
    "7 shows that this  going up \" behavior is significantly different for different models .",
    "the scdm curves are much more quickly and strongly  going up \" than lcdm and ocdm .",
    "this is because clusters in the scdm formed later than in the lcdm and ocdm . in the latter case , the ratio @xmath179/n(>m , r_0)$ ] remains equal to about unity in the range of @xmath183 mpc and @xmath184 , while for the former the corresponding radius range is much smaller .",
    "we have re - calculated fig . 7 by changing the value of @xmath4 .",
    "the results show that in the range @xmath185 , the ocdm and lcdm always have a larger radius range of the invariance than scdm .",
    "therefore , the radius range in which the abundance scaling invariance holds is effective for discriminating models .",
    "the fitting done in  5.1 has shown that a constant @xmath4 of 0.52 - 0.70 in the radius @xmath2 from 1 to 4 @xmath13 mpc is consistent with all data . moreover , considering most gravitational lensing and x - ray clusters used in  5.1 are of moderate redshift , the numbers of @xmath186 and @xmath187 mpc are actually real for moderate redshift .",
    "thus , the scdm will be in difficulty with the measurements of scaling invariance .",
    "it should be pointed out that the radius range @xmath177 mpc in  5.1 is for the physical scale of relevant clusters .",
    "a physical radius range 1 - 4 @xmath13 mpc corresponds to a comoving range of 1.5 - 6 @xmath13 mpc at redshift @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , this test is more robust at higher redshift",
    ".    it may be difficult to directly test the scaling at high redshifts , because mass determination is often limited by the luminosity(or surface brightness ) detection threshold of the survey . in this case",
    "we may turn to the correlation function .",
    "the scaling gives testable prediction on the correlation lengths of clusters on different scales .",
    "this will be investigated in xu , fang & deng ( 1998 ) .",
    "we have studied the scaling invariance of abundance of rich clusters . both the n - body simulation and the available observational data have confirmed the existence of the scaling invariance .",
    "this scaling is characterized by index @xmath4 which can be determined by the abundances of clusters on different scale @xmath2 , or by fitting mass - radius relation of clusters .",
    "the scaling gains a further support from the following result : the @xmath4 given by x - ray and gravitational lensing mass estimates is the same as that from the iras cluster abundance . despite the significance level of current results",
    "is not high , it is worth of revealing the general behavior of the scaling of cosmic clustering in different evolutionary stages .",
    "it can already be employed for discrimination among models .",
    "the lcdm and ocdm abundances can always have a scaling in a larger scale range ( @xmath189 mpc ) with @xmath7 for @xmath184 . while the scdm can only provide a smaller scaling range ( @xmath190 mpc ) with @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "if @xmath4 is allowed to be @xmath193 , the scdm can provide a scaling in the range of 1 - 4 @xmath13 mpc for @xmath184",
    ". however , the scdm is difficult to fit @xmath194 and @xmath195 mpc simultaneously .",
    "this result may cause some troubles for the scdm .    in general",
    ", the mass density profiles of clusters in the low density models are steeper than that of the corresponding clusters in higher @xmath196 models ( jing et al .",
    "in other words , the index @xmath4 for the @xmath197 model is always larger than that in a low density model ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "therefore , the current result of the mass - radius scaling seems to favor models with a lower mass density .",

    "xpw was supported by the national science foundation of china and the national science council of taiwan .",
    "let us briefly introduce the dwt analysis of large scale structures , for the details referring to ( fang & pando 1997 ; pando & fang 1996 , 1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "we consider here a 1-d mass density distribution @xmath199 or contrast @xmath200/\\bar{\\rho}$ ] , which are mathematically random fields over a spatial range @xmath201 .",
    "it is not difficult to extend all results developed in this section into 2-d and 3-d because the dwt bases for higher dimension can be constructed by a direct product of 1-d bases .",
