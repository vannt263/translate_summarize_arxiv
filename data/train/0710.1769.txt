    "nanotubes can be prefabricated and then assembled into the desired geometry , or they can be fabricated in place using chemical vapor deposition ( cvd).@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] cvd is preferred since the growth can be widely tuned , both in yield and structure ( single- vs. multi - walled ) , by modifying the experimental conditions . while there are a vast number of cvd recipes available in the literature for both single- and multi - walled nanotube growth , most studies of the growth process have focused on the role of the carbon precursor ( e.g. co , ch@xmath3 , c@xmath4h@xmath4 ) and temperature as control parameters with less attention placed on the choice of catalyst and substrate.@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] optimization of the catalytic process requires an understanding of the catalyst chemistry throughout the growth process , including the initial chemical state of the catalyst before the introduction of the feedstock , as well as the catalytic decomposition of the feedstock in or on the catalyst particle.@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] only recently have studies focused on the catalyst - feedstock and catalyst - substrate interaction.@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ]    it is well established that the yield of single - walled nanotube growth on silicon substrates is dramatically reduced compared with growth on thick silicon dioxide layers , due to poisoning of the catalyst by the formation of a silicide.@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] intriguingly , the growth of multi - walled nanotubes on silicon substrates is regularly reported and seems less susceptible to catalyst poisoning,@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] yet the cause of this difference has not been addressed . for device applications it is desirable to use thin oxides to increase the gate capacitance and gate efficiency , and",
    "thus it is important to understand how to minimize oxide thickness while still preventing catalyst poisoning .",
    "though thick silicon dioxide layers have been used as diffusion barriers during nanotube growth , there has been no investigations to date that determine the the effectiveness of ultra - thin oxides .",
    "here we demonstrate explicitly that catalyst diffusion through the ultra - thin silicon dioxide layer controls the formation of the non - catalytic silicide . using x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) , we study the interfacial reactions between the substrate and iron- or nickel - based nanotube catalysts during the initial temperature ramp portion of a cvd growth cycle . we show that ultra - thin oxide layers ( 4  nm or greater ) are sufficient to inhibit the silicide formation and permit high yield growth of single - walled carbon nanotubes . on thinner oxides or clean silicon ,",
    "silicide formation begins by 600  @xmath0c ( ni ) or 800  @xmath0c ( fe ) and the catalyst is entirely consumed in the silicide at the growth temperature of single - walled nanotubes .",
    "the silicide formation temperatures account for the difference in single- versus multi - walled nanotube growth because multi - walled nanotubes are grown at lower temperatures where some of the catalyst remains unreacted and active for catalysis .",
    "interestingly , the silicides form while the silicon dioxide is still present on the substrate , indicating that diffusion of metal or silicon through the oxide is occurring .",
    "we show that it is metal diffusion through the oxide , forming a metal silicide underneath the oxide , which dominates the interfacial reactions between the nanotube catalyst and the silicon substrate .",

    "there is a small loss in iron intensity , due to either agglomeration of the catalyst on the surface ( thereby reducing the measured intensity due to the finite electron escape depth ) or desorption of the iron into the vacuum while annealing.@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] there is also a shift in the center of gravity of the fe  2p@xmath5 core level as the fe@xmath7 oxide ( feo ) transforms into the more stable fe@xmath8 oxide ( fe@xmath4o@xmath9)@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] and the satellite peaks at 715  ev and 730  ev become better defined .",
    "even at 1000  @xmath0c , the catalyst remains as iron oxide because there is no reaction pathway to reduce it to pure iron .",
    "the necessary reduction to metallic iron in a cvd reactor would come from flowing hydrogen or from feedstock decomposition products , enabling the catalysis of carbon nanotube growth .    at the opposite extreme - that of hydrogen - terminated silicon on which single - walled nanotube growth is inhibited - surface reactions play a major role in the evolution of catalyst chemistry even at low temperatures .    .",
    "by 800  @xmath0c , the iron begins to alloy with the substrate , forming an iron silicide , seen in ( d ) by a 0.4  ev shift in the fe  2p@xmath5 core level and in ( c ) by the emergence of a plasmon loss peak.,width=216 ]    while iron nitrate catalyst that has been deposited on a hydrogen terminated silicon substrate remains oxidized at room temperature ( figure  [ fig2]b ) , the center of gravity of the fe  2p@xmath5 core level is shifted to 710.5  ev , indicating that the iron has been partially reduced as compared to the catalyst on the thick oxide .",
    "whereas the si  2p spectrum of the thick oxide shows only a peak at 103.3  ev due to the sio@xmath4 layer , the spectrum of the hydrogen - terminated substrate ( figure  [ fig2]a ) at room temperature resolves the si  2p atomic core levels ( 99.3 and 103.3  ev ) , as well as a small , broad peak on the high binding energy side of the si  2p peak , at around 102.7  ev , indicating the formation of a non - stoichiometric silicon suboxide.@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] this suboxide could have formed in air after the hf oxide strip but before introduction in the vacuum chamber , or could account for the small amount of reduction in the iron as compared with the catalyst on the thick oxide .",

    "in contrast to the thick oxide , iron catalyst deposited on hydrogen terminated silicon begins to reduce to metallic iron when the catalyst by the time it is annealed to 550  @xmath0c .",
    "this is seen in figure  [ fig2]b by the decrease in fe  2p intensity at 710.5  ev , 724.1  ev , and the associated satellites of iron oxide , and by the appearance of peaks at 707.4  ev and 720.7  ev corresponding to the fe  2p core levels of fe@xmath10 .",

    ", the iron oxide has been fully reduced . as in the case of a thick oxide ,",
    "the reduction in uhv must come from a surface reaction between the oxidized catalyst and the substrate .",
    "indeed , there is an appreciable exchange of oxygen from the iron oxide to the silicon substrate , leading to a marked increase in intensity of the silicon oxide peak , accompanied by a shift in the peak position to higher binding energies ( figure  [ fig2]a ) . at 550  @xmath0c the silicon oxide peak shifts to higher binding energy , and between 700  @xmath0c and 800  @xmath0c the peak reaches 103.3  ev which is characteristic of stoichiometric sio@xmath4 .",
    "this indicates that the iron oxide catalyst is reduced by the silicon substrate leading to the formation of a thin sio@xmath4 layer .",

    "the 0.4  ev total shift in the fe  2p@xmath5 peak position , accompanied by the appearance of a peak @xmath1121  ev higher in binding energy , is indicative of the formation of an iron silicide , likely fesi@xmath4.@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] the peak at 729  ev is due to a plasmon loss , seen in figure 2c , and has been observed in electron energy loss spectroscopy@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] as well as xps@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] investigations of fe / si multilayers .",
    "further , the intensity of the shoulder on the si  2p peak increases and the sio@xmath4 has desorbed entirely as evidenced by the loss of the @xmath11103.3  ev feature in the si  2p spectrum . though the shoulder in the si  2p spectrum at 100.5  ev seems to be associated with the formation of the silicide , the apparent binding energy of the shoulder is too high to be due to a fesi@xmath12 core level which would be expected to be shifted by only @xmath110.2  ev.@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] at present , the origin of this shoulder is not known .",
    "annealing at 1000  @xmath0c ( not shown ) only leads to a decrease in the intensity of the iron peaks , but causes no noticeable changes in the peak positions , indicating that the silicide formation is complete at 900  @xmath0c .",

    "the initial metal or metal oxide is completely reduced by the silicon substrate leading to the growth of a silicon dioxide layer . after being reduced",
    ", the metal can then react with the silicon substrate directly , leading to the formation of a silicide .",
    "the initial silicide formation at @xmath11600  @xmath0c for nickel and @xmath11800  @xmath0c for iron explains the differing growth yields of single- and multi - walled nanotubes on clean silicon substrates .",
    "since cvd of multi - walled nanotubes on iron occurs at relatively low temperatures , the metal remains unreacted and available for nanotube catalysis .",
    "in contrast , the growth of single - walled nanotubes is performed at higher temperatures where all of the catalysts have been consumed by the silicide . in the case of iron presented in figure  [ fig2]d ,",
    "the fe  2p@xmath5 peak is only shifted by 0.2  ev at the multi - walled nanotube growth temperature of 800  @xmath0c .",
    "this shift is approximately half of the binding energy shift that would correspond to a stoichiometric iron silicide , indicating that catalytic regions of pure iron are still present which permit high yield growth of multi - walled nanotubes . by 900",
    "@xmath0c the iron silicide formation is complete , preventing nanotube catalysis and leading to poor growth yield .",
    "since iron silicide reduces catalytic yield and forms when iron - based catalysts are used on bare silicon wafers but not on highly oxidized wafers , it is important to know how to maintain the iron in a catalytic state without requiring the use of a thick oxide . for electronic applications such as fets",
    ", the use of thinner oxides gives higher gate efficiency due to the increased capacitance of the gate dielectric .",
    "de los arcos and co - authors have shown that iron thin films maintain their catalytic state when they are placed on top of nitrides ( tin ) and oxides ( al@xmath4o@xmath9 and tio@xmath4),@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] but the use of silicon oxide would be more compatible with industrial silicon processing . in order to utilize silicon dioxide ,",
    "it is important to determine what is the minimum thickness required to prevent the formation of a silicide . to determine this ,",
    "iron catalyst is deposited onto 3 , 4 , and 8  nm oxides , and we use the measured binding energy of the reduced fe  2p@xmath5 core level around 707.3  ev to detect any silicide formation ( figs .",
    "[ fig4]a - d ) .",
    "if the silicon dioxide layer is thick enough to prevent silicide formation , the iron core level will remain at 707.3  ev , but if a silicide forms the peak will shift to higher binding energy , where 707.7  ev is the position of the fully formed iron silicide .",
    "as seen above for the case of iron or nickel on hydrogen - terminated silicon , as the substrates are annealed some of the iron oxide is reduced by the formation of silicon dioxide , even for iron nitrate on an 8  nm oxide . after this reduction",
    ", the metal catalyst could react further with the substrate to form the silicide . for catalyst deposited on the clean silicon ( figure  [ fig4]a ) or a 3  nm oxide ( figure  [ fig4]b )",
    ", we see that the iron core level shifts to higher binding energy above 800  @xmath0c , indicating the nucleation of the silicide , followed by complete silicide formation at 900  @xmath0c .",
    "in contrast , heating the catalyst to 900  @xmath0c on an 8  nm oxide ( figure  [ fig4]d ) does not lead to silicide formation . in the case of the 4  nm silicon dioxide layer ( figure  [ fig4]c )",
    ", we see a small up - shift of 0.2  ev after the catalyst has been annealed at 900  @xmath0c , suggesting that some of the iron has been incorporated into a silicide , but that an appreciable amount of the iron remains in reduced form .",
    "thus , a 4  nm oxide layer represents the minimum thickness that can inhibit the formation of the iron silicide during the growth of single - walled nanotubes at 900  @xmath0c .",
    "this value is similar to a previous estimate of 5 - 6  nm , where the role of non - catalytic silicides was conjectured rather than directly shown.@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ]    having uncovered the minimum barrier oxide thickness in the case of iron catalyst , it is important to determine what mechanism sets this limit .",
    "close observation of the xps spectra reveals a key signature of the mechanism of the interfacial reaction : the silicide is forming even though a silicon dioxide layer is present on the surface .",
    "this indicates that either the silicon is diffusing up through the oxide to form the silicide , or that the metal is diffusing down .",
    "the direction of diffusion is demonstrated most clearly in the case of a nickel thin film on a native oxide substrate ( figure[fig5 ] ) .     and ( b ) si  2p core levels for a nickel film catalyst on native oxide .",
    "the metallic nickel present at 600  @xmath0c has been incorporated into a silicide by 800  @xmath0c before the desorption of the sio@xmath4 layer . when the oxide layer is removed , the nickel signal increases indicating that there is a higher concentration of nickel beneath the oxide than on top due to diffusion of metal through the oxide at lower temperatures.,width=240 ]    at low temperatures the fully reduced nickel film coexists with the thin sio@xmath4 layer , however by 800  @xmath0c the ni  2p@xmath5 core level is fully shifted due to the formation of the silicide , while the sio@xmath4 layer remains .",
    "after annealing to 900  @xmath0c , to desorb the silicon dioxide layer , the spectra show an increase in intensity from nickel , while the binding energy remains the same .",
    "this increase in intensity is clear evidence that the nickel silicide was originally beneath the sio@xmath4 , where its xps intensity was reduced due to the finite electron escape depth;@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] annealing the sample to remove the sio@xmath4 eliminates the scattering nickel photoelectrons , leading to an increase in the nickel intensity . for the silicide to form beneath the oxide",
    ", the metal catalyst must diffuse through the oxide .",
    "the diffusion mechanism further explains why single - walled nanotube growth is more inhibited than multi - walled nanotube growth since the diffusion kinetics are enhanced at the higher single - walled nanotube growth temperatures .    given the diffusion mechanism , one can tailor the oxide thickness to maximize the gate coupling while maintaining the catalyst in an active state .",
    "catalyst diffusion through the oxide is determined by the temperature dependent diffusion constant @xmath13 and the corresponding diffusion length @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the activation energy for diffusion and @xmath16 is the diffusion time .",
    "using the bulk diffusion constant for iron in electronic grade silicon dioxide ( @xmath17  @xmath18s@xmath19 , @xmath20)@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] one would only expect the iron to diffuse @xmath21  nm during the temperature ramp to 900  @xmath0c , roughly three times shorter than observed in xps .",
    "the 4  nm diffusion length observed can be explained by a small reduction of @xmath22 in the activation energy , yielding a five - fold increase in the effective diffusion constant .",
    "an increased diffusion constant is not surprising for such ultra - thin oxides since they have higher concentrations of pinhole defects as compared to thick oxides . indeed",
    ", previous studies of metals on ultra - thin silicon oxides have shown that pinholes or defects in the oxide significantly enhances the diffusion process.@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] by determining the critical oxide thickness that prevents silicide formation for iron catalyst , we can extrapolate to determine the critical thickness for cobalt and nickel which are the other common single - walled nanotube catalysts . for cobalt ,",
    "the bulk diffusion parameters are @xmath23@xmath18s@xmath19 and @xmath24,@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] leading to a diffusion length and critical oxide thickness of @xmath25  nm at a 900  @xmath0c growth temperature.@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] this bulk diffusion length is sufficiently thick that high quality oxide layers can be made to prevent defect - enhanced diffusion . for nickel , bulk diffusion ( @xmath26@xmath18s@xmath19",
    ",  @xmath27)@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] would predict a @xmath28  nm critical thickness , which is in the regime of the enhanced diffusion seen for iron .",
    "if we assume a proportionate decrease in the activation energy for ni diffusion ( @xmath29 ) , the critical oxide thickness at the 900  @xmath0c growth temperature@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] becomes @xmath30  nm . by minimizing the concentration of defects in the oxide , one could reduce these critical oxide thicknesses further .",
    "though the critical thickness could also be reduced by using a more effective barrier layer than silicon dioxide , the nanotube - gate coupling will also change due to changes in the insulator capacitance .",
    "having determined the minimum oxide thickness to prevent catalyst diffusion through the oxide layer from xps , it is important to ensure that the conclusions are consistent with growth observations .",
    "surface reactions observed in uhv may be inhibited when the process is repeated in a cvd reactor where reactant gases can influence catalyst chemistry .",
    "since transition - metal silicides are more stable than transition - metal carbides at nanotube growth temperatures,@xmath1@xcite@xmath2 $ ] it is expected that the reactants will not be able to reverse the silicide formation and nanotube catalysis will be inhibited . to test these conclusions ,",
    "growth was attempted on unannealed pieces of each of the thin oxides .",

    "the images shown depict one of the few locations where nanotubes did grow , and the reported densities represent an upper limit on the nanotube yield .",

    "in contrast , and consistent with our xps results , yields on the 4 and 8  nm oxides ( figs .",
    "[ fig4]g , h ) are significantly improved .",
