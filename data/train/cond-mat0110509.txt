    "since the pioneering work of darcy thompson @xcite at the beginning of this century understanding the origin of complex structures involving living organisms has been a challenge for physicists and biologists alike .",
    "in particular the patterns formed in growing colonies of microorganisms , like bacteria @xcite and fungi @xcite have attracted much interest because they exhibit properties akin to those in inanimate systems far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "early mathematical models of fungal growth @xcite , considered fungi as purely additive assemblages of discrete individual hyphal units that duplicate at regular intervals and homogeneously .",
    "these models predict the crossover from exponential growth to linear growth of the peripheral zone as the colony matures . however , they are unable to account for many of the observable macroscopic properties ( as morphological changes for instance ) exhibited by fungi .",
    "fungal growth experiments on agar plates have shown @xcite that filamental growth leads to a fractal colony with patterns that have much in common with those observed in diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) processes @xcite .",
    "similar branched morphologies have also been observed in bacterial growth @xcite where the relevance of dla was nicely demonstrated @xcite .",
    "sophisticated communication mechanisms , including chemotactic signals and feedback response , were later proposed @xcite in order to understand the origin of branched growth in bacteria",
    ". a similar mathematical modelling might be adequate to explain the dla - like patterns of hyphae .",
    "however , quantitative measurements of the fractal dimension of mycelia @xcite have shown that the dimension varies in time and from one species to another .",
    "also , the growth mechanism of dla clusters seems rather different from the hyphal extension of fungi .",
    "some reaction - diffusion models have also been studied @xcite , which seem to capture esential features of the filamental fungi .",
    "in contrast , under appropriate environmental conditions , colonies of many fungal species are also able to display a compact phase @xcite with uni - cellular non - cooperative growth and generate non - dla patterns . in this case , transitions between different morphologies are also observed @xcite when the relevant parameters in the growth conditions are varied . a mathematical model able to include all these fungal patterns on solid media has remained elusive up to now @xcite . here",
    "we show that a simple stochastic model containing some generic biological mechanisms is able to reproduce a variety of patterns observed in the growth of fungal colonies on solid agar plates .",
    "the model takes into account the effect of the accumulation of waste products , which play an important role as inhibitors for cell division .",
    "matsuura and miyazima @xcite carried out experiments with the fungus _ aspergillus oryzae _ on agar plates of different stiffness and with different concentrations of nutrients ( glucose ) .",
    "they observed that the fungal colonies on solid media formed a variety of shapes ( see figure 1 ) . in nutrient - rich conditions ,",
    "the colonies showed a homogeneous and smooth growth front ( fig .",
    "in contrast , growth in glucose - poor conditions resulted in colonies with rougher surfaces ( fig .",
    "the physiological ability of the fungus to divide and grow is diminished at lower temperatures @xcite , when even morphological instabilities ( fig .",
    "1c ) or an incipient branched growth ( fig .",
    "1d ) can be observed depending on the nutrient concentration .",
    "similar patterns have recently been obtained in experiments with colonies of the yeast _ pichia membranaefaciens _ on solidified agarose @xcite . how can these morphological changes be qualitatively described and understood within one simple mathematical model ? .",
    "it is known that metabolic products generated by fungal cells during the degradation of nutrients diffuse through the medium and may act as impurities inhibiting further cell division @xcite .",
    "we have considered the effect of toxic metabolites on the morphology of the colony .",
    "we have studied a model in which the growth probability at every site is coupled with an inhibitory field generated by the fungus itself .",
    "the model is defined on a two dimensional lattice as follows . at time",
    "@xmath0 a lattice site can be either _ occupied _ by a fungal cell or _",
    "vacant_. two quantities are assigned to every site @xmath1 in the lattice : ( 1 ) the total age of the nearest neighbour cells @xmath2 of that site and ( 2 ) the field @xmath3 containing the concentration of waste products .",
    "the spread of inhibitors from a single cell situated at @xmath4 is modelled by means of a diffusion equation with a source : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the step function ( @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xmath11 is the diffusion constant of the metabolites , @xmath12 is the inhibitor chemicals production rate , and @xmath13 is the time at which the polluting cell at @xmath4 was born .",
    "the total density of waste products at any vacant site at time @xmath0 is calculated by adding the contributions coming from every occupied site in colony situated within a distance @xmath14 .",
    "colony growth occurs because of the division of individual cells , thus only nearest neighbours of occupied sites have a chance of becoming occupied .",
    "we assume that the probability for a vacant site @xmath1 of being occupied in the next time step increases with the total age @xmath2 of the occupied nearest neighbours of that vacant site @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , at every time step , we assign a growth probability @xmath16 to every vacant site @xmath1 given by @xmath17,\\ ] ] which depends on the two fields @xmath2 ( total age of neighbouring occupied sites ) and @xmath18 ( waste concentration ) introduced above . in eq.([grow - prob ] ) , @xmath19 is an arbitrary monotonous increasing function satisfying @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( properties required for @xmath22 to be a probability ) .",
    "the results do not depend on the detailed form of @xmath19 and in the following we use @xmath23 for simplicity .",
    "the suppression of cell division due to the accumulation of metabolites is represented by @xmath24 that is a decreasing function of the concentration of waste chemicals . in order to see a significant effect of the inhibitors ,",
    "the decay of @xmath25 with @xmath26 must be rapid enough . in the simulations we are presenting in this paper @xmath27",
    "was assumed , @xmath28 being a concentration threshold above which the effect of inhibitors becomes important .",
    "other simple functional forms may be used and similar patterns are obtained provided that @xmath24 decays rapidly enough . finally , the external parameter @xmath29 controls directly the growth rate and is associated with the food supply ( media richer in nutrients correspond to larger values of @xmath29 ) .",
    "we carried out extensive simulations of the model .",
    "the simulations were performed on a two dimensional triangular lattice with open boundary conditions , simultaneously updating eqs.([diff - inh ] ) and ( [ grow - prob ] ) in every time step .",
    "the position of the front is determined and the height @xmath30 at every column @xmath31 is used to study the front dynamics . in order to mimic the experiments , the growth is initiated from a straight line of randomly occupied sites at @xmath32 .",
    "the dynamics of the growing front is characterized by the height fluctuations , which are measured by means of the front width over the total system of size @xmath33 , @xmath34 . the use of other quantities to measure the width is helpful when instabilities or overhangs appear , like for instance the difference @xmath35 - min[h]$ ] between the maximum and minimum heights , and gave similar results .",
    "the model has two external parameters , namely : the growth rate @xmath29 , and the concentration threshold @xmath28 for inhibitory effects .",
    "these are to be thought of as effective parameters and their relation to experimental variables such as temperature , concentration of nutrients , _ etc . _",
    "may not be a simple one .",
    "it is to be noted that , if experimental conditions change , for instance in such a way that the absorption of inhibitors by the fungal cells is enhanced , the effect may be well represented by either a lower threshold @xmath28 or a wider spread distance @xmath14 ( or even a combination of both ) .",
    "we performed computer simulations of the model for different values of @xmath29 and @xmath28 . in the following we discuss the different front morphologies that are obtained depending on the values of these two parameters , and how they are related to experimental observations . in fig .",
    "2 we present a summary of the resulting numerical fungal patterns .",
    "the first morphological transition occurs in the limit @xmath36 , in which the inhibitors become irrelevant ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we found that the surface of the colony is flat ( fig .",
    "2a ) when inhibitors have little effect ( for @xmath38 ) and the medium is rich in nutrients .",
    "conversely , the growth front becomes rougher and eden - like ( fig .",
    "2b ) for a poorer medium . in fact , a quantitative measure of the roughness ( see below ) indicates that the fractal dimension of the front is @xmath39 @xcite as in the eden model @xcite .",
    "these morphological phases are separated by a continuous phase transition at a critical value of @xmath40 . for large growth rates ( rich medium )",
    "@xmath41 the front is flat , @xmath42 .",
    "in contrast , if the growth rate is reduced below @xmath43 ( poor medium ) the front becomes rougher and exhibits the dynamical scaling behaviour typical of a scale - free roughening process @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , in the rough phase the width grows like a power law @xmath44 until a stationary regime is reached and @xmath45 , where @xmath33 is the system size .",
    "our determination of the time exponent @xmath46 and the roughness exponent @xmath47 indicates that the model belongs to the edwards - wilkinson universality class @xcite in this phase .",
    "the computation of the roughness exponent @xmath48 allows us to determine the fractal dimension @xmath49 of the front through the relation @xmath50 , which is consistent with eden - like growth .",
    "this morphological transition from rough to flat growth has recently been studied in detail by us @xcite for a much simpler version of this model , which corresponds to the limit @xmath36 .",
    "we found that @xmath51 in the limit case of @xmath52 .",
    "when approaching the roughening transition from the rough phase ( @xmath53 ) to the flat phase ( @xmath41 ) , a diverging correlation lenght @xmath54 appears .",
    "the critical exponent was found to be @xmath55 . at the phase transition",
    "the scaling exponents can be calculated by mapping the problem onto directed percolation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "experimental realizations of transitions from a flat to a rough front can been observed in the matsuura and miyazima experiments shown in figure 1a-1b . as our model predicts the richer the medium the flater the front .",
    "if the effect of toxic inhibitors on the fungus is enhanced , further interfacial instabilities in the front appear .",
    "lower temperatures are less favorable for the physiological activity of the fungus @xcite and its capacity to divide .",
    "one can model this effect by a smaller threshold @xmath28 for the inhibition of cell division .",
    "one can observe ( fig .",
    "2c ) that , as @xmath28 is decreased , deep grooves and overhangs develop in the colony and some regions with high concentration of inhibitors are eventually surrounded by the colony front .",
    "the presence of a unstable growth dynamics can be realized by the appearance of an extremely rapid ( exponential ) growth of the interface width @xmath56 in this regime , as shown in fig .",
    "4 . this regime is to be compared with the patterns observed in the expriments ( fig .",
    "finally , in the worst of the situations , the growth becomes very localized and only the dominant filaments branch out into the empty medium ( fig .",
    "this is due to the building up of extremely high concentrations of waste products in some regions that the fungus can not invade any longer .",
    "there is qualitative agreement with the experiment shown in fig .",
    "the four major morphological phases are summarized in the qualitative phase diagram in fig .",
    "5 . the solid line that separates the rough from the flat phase in fig . 5",
    "has recently been shown to be a nonequilibrium continuous phase transition and can be mapped into directed percolation @xcite . however",
    ", we were unable to find a sharp transition between the remaining phases .",
    "our results indicate that the morphologies generated during the growth of fungal colonies on solid agar can be modeled by taking into account ( 1 ) the building up of a concentration of waste inhibitors in the medium and ( 2 ) the provision of nutrients . we have studied a simple model which allows us to understand the interplay between these two mechanisms .",
    "the morphological tranformations that we have found can be compared with recent experiments on pattern formation in fungal growth .    in our model , a constant growth rate @xmath29 has been assumed .",
    "the effect of the exhaustion and diffusion of nutrients can be modeled by replacing @xmath29 by a diffusive field , which is depleted at a certain rate at sites occupied by fungal cells .",
    "this would have a major impact on the front dynamics as the front will eventually stop growing because of agar exhaustion .",
    "our model approach to pattern formation in fungal colony growth is stochastic and includes in a natural way the random nature of cell division .",
    "this together with the accumulation of inhibiting chemicals produces some of the different morphological phases observed in experiments .",
    "this is in contrast to other existing models based upon non - linear diffusion , in which evolution is deterministic and patterns arise from nonlinear instabilities .",
    "they represent a different level of description of the same phenomena .",
    "both type of models coexist at different levels of description .    finally , while our model can account for the morphological changes observed in some fungi growing in agar culture",
    ", we should mention that this model may not be appropiate for describing the morphological patterns observed in other fungal species .",
    "our results compare well with the fungus _ aspergillus oryzae _ which , like many members of this genus ( and also the genus _ penicillum _ ) , form dense colonies that expand only very slowly and seem to be self - inhibitory .",
    "the authors are in debt to s. matsuura for kindly providing us photographs of their experiments .",
    "we thank t. sams for useful discussions on his work and m.j .",
    "carlile , s. matsuura , and e. calle for helpful comments and correspondence .",
