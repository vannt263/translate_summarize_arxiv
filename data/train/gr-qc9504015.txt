    "there has been considerable interest recently in studying black hole pair creation by instanton methods , and a number of interesting results have been obtained @xcite .",
    "the study of black hole pair creation has so far been mostly restricted to the pair creation of oppositely - charged black holes by an electromagnetic field , where pair creation is possible because the negative potential energy of the created pair of black holes in the background electromagnetic field balances their rest mass energy .",
    "black holes can , however , also be pair created by a cosmological background , as a positive cosmological constant supplies the necessary negative potential energy .",
    "we will examine the pair creation of electrically or magnetically charged black holes in a cosmological background .",
    "there are two instantons , which describe pair production of non - extreme and extreme black holes respectively .",
    "there is another instanton , the charged generalisation of the instanton found in @xcite , but careful analysis suggests this latter instanton does not formally represent black hole pair creation .",
    "we find that some of the most interesting results of the electromagnetic case can be reproduced in the cosmological case ; in particular , the pair creation rate is still determined by the entropy of the solutions . indeed",
    ", there is an interesting similarity between the instantons we find and the instantons found in @xcite for the pair creation of black holes in an electromagnetic field .",
    "we feel that these similarities encourage the idea that the results of these instanton calculations represent real quantum gravity effects , and will not be qualitatively modified by the inclusion of quantum corrections . in other words , since the main features are similar in these two disparate models , we think that they represent features that should also be present in the full quantum theory",
    ".    we will begin by considering the charged @xmath0 metric , which can be interpreted as representing a pair of oppositely - charged black holes accelerating away from each other in a flat background spacetime . as there is no force to accelerate the black holes , this",
    "metric is not in general regular .",
    "the approach taken in @xcite was to add a background electromagnetic field to this metric by a harrison transformation , giving the ernst metric , which could be made regular by a suitable choice of field strength .",
    "the background field provides the necessary force to accelerate the black holes .",
    "we will consider adding a cosmological constant to the @xmath0 metric instead , and see if we can obtain a non - singular solution by using the cosmological acceleration to accelerate the black holes .",
    "we find that we can , but that the @xmath0 metric reduces to the reissner - nordstrm de sitter solution whenever the acceleration of the black holes is matched to the cosmological acceleration in this way .",
    "there are in fact two ways to obtain a non - singular solution in the charged @xmath0 metric itself .",
    "one is to set the acceleration to zero , in which case the @xmath0 metric reduces to the reissner - nordstrm metric .",
    "the other way to get rid of the conical singularities is to allow the black hole and acceleration horizons to coincide , which has been referred to as the type i instanton @xcite .",
    "we have found that the @xmath0 metric in this special case has the same functional form as the reissner - nordstrm metric , but it is now what is usually regarded as the azimuthal coordinate which is playing the role of time .",
    "that is , one can obtain this metric by analytically continuing @xmath1 in the euclidean reissner - nordstrm metric .",
    "as the only non - singular versions of the charged @xmath0 metric with a cosmological constant reduce to the reissner - nordstrm de sitter metric , we would like to know what instantons can be made from this metric .",
    "we find that there are four types of instantons , referred to as the lukewarm , cold , ultracold @xcite , and charged nariai solutions .",
    "the euclidean section of the lukewarm solution has topology @xmath2 , and it can be thought of as representing pair creation of non - extreme black holes .",
    "the euclidean section of the cold solution has topology @xmath3 , and it can be thought of as representing pair creation of extreme black holes ( by an extreme black hole , we mean one in which the inner and outer horizons coincide ) .",
    "the charged nariai solution has topology @xmath2 ; its interpretation is not clear .",
    "the ultracold solution is just a special case of the cold solution where all three horizons coincide , but the metric is quite different in this special case .",
    "there is an analogy between this set of instantons and the instantons constructed from the ernst solution in @xcite : there one had an extreme black hole instanton , a non - extreme black hole instanton , and the type i instanton ; here we have the cold , lukewarm and charged nariai instantons .    in the instanton approach ,",
    "the wavefunction is approximated by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the action of the instanton , so the partition function , which gives the pair creation rate , is approximated by @xmath6 .",
    "the action for einstein - maxwell with a cosmological constant is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ricci scalar of the metric @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the cosmological constant ( we assume @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 is the electromagnetic field tensor . the boundary of the manifold is @xmath13 , which has metric @xmath14 , and extrinsic curvature @xmath15 . since there is no asymptotic region for these solutions , this action is the microcanonical action @xcite , and thus the entropy is @xcite @xmath16 in section [ action ] , we calculate the action for the instantons described in section [ instsec ] .",
    "we find that the pair creation rate given by these instantons is smaller than the rate which de sitter space gives to propagate from nothing to an @xmath17 .",
    "thus the contribution from de sitter space will dominate that of these instantons in the path integral , in agreement with experience .",
    "we also find that the entropy of these solutions is always equal to one quarter of the area of the horizons which appear on the euclidean section , as expected .",
    "these instantons are thus very similar to the ernst instantons .",
    "we summarise our results in section [ concl ] .",
    "the well - known @xmath0 metric solution of the einstein - maxwell equations , which describes a pair of charged black holes undergoing uniform acceleration , was found in @xcite .",
    "there is a less well - known generalisation of this solution to include a cosmological constant @xcite . in the usual @xmath0 metric",
    ", it is not possible to eliminate the possible conical singularities at both poles in general .",
    "the @xmath0 metric is interpreted as describing two oppositely - charged black holes undergoing uniform acceleration , and these singularities are interpreted as representing `` rods '' or `` strings '' which provide the force necessary to accelerate the black holes .",
    "if we consider the @xmath0 metric with a positive cosmological constant , one might think that the cosmological constant can provide the necessary force , and so we should be able to eliminate the conical singularities , and thus obtain a completely regular metric .",
    "what we find is that the elimination of the conical singularities , which we regard as fixing the acceleration parameter @xmath18 , causes the metric to reduce to the reissner - nordstrm de sitter metric .",
    "the cosmological @xmath0 metric can be written as @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 the cosmological constant is @xmath10 , which we will assume is positive .",
    "the gauge field in the magnetic case is @xmath22 and the gauge field in the electric case is @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath25 the roots of @xmath26 in ascending order , and by @xmath27 the roots of @xmath28 in ascending order .",
    "we will restrict the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath18 so that all these roots are real . as with the usual @xmath0 metric",
    ", @xmath30 is interpreted as the inner black hole horizon , @xmath31 is interpreted as the outer black hole horizon , and @xmath32 is interpreted as the acceleration or cosmological horizon .",
    "we will first restrict @xmath33 to @xmath34 in order to obtain a metric of the appropriate signature .",
    "we will restrict @xmath35 to @xmath36 , as when @xmath37 the conformal factor in the metric diverges , and so this corresponds to infinity . in order to have a regular solution",
    ", we must avoid having conical singularities at @xmath38 or @xmath39 , so we must demand that @xcite @xmath40 and identify @xmath41 periodically with period @xmath42 .",
    "this assumes that @xmath43 is at a finite distance from @xmath44 , but if one took @xmath45 , then @xmath38 would lie at infinite proper distance from any other point , so that there could be no conical singularity there .",
    "that is , the @xmath46 sections would no longer be compact .",
    "this is analogous to what happens with the euclidean section of an extreme black hole @xcite .",
    "however , for positive cosmological constant , @xmath28 will have just two real roots if @xmath47 , so this contradicts our restriction of the parameters .",
    "therefore we must satisfy ( [ nostrut ] ) , which corresponds to @xmath48 and can only be satisfied by taking @xmath49 .",
    "this seems to imply that the @xmath46 section shrinks to a point , but this is just due to a poor choice of coordinate system . in the limit that @xmath50 , the proper distance between @xmath43 and @xmath44 remains finite , as can be seen by the following coordinate transformation .",
    "the limit @xmath51 corresponds to the limit @xmath52 from above .",
    "let us write @xmath53 , so that the appropriate limit is @xmath54 . with this parametrisation , @xmath55 so @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "then set @xmath58 in the limit @xmath59 , the metric becomes @xmath60,\\ ] ] and if we make the further coordinate transformation @xmath61 it becomes @xmath62 where @xmath63 note also that as @xmath41 has period @xmath64 , @xmath65 has period @xmath66 .",
    "the range of @xmath67 is from @xmath68 to @xmath69 , and @xmath70 runs from @xmath68 to @xmath71 .",
    "the gauge field is now @xmath72 in the magnetic case , and @xmath73 in the electric case .",
    "thus , this can be identified as a reissner - nordstrm de sitter solution with charge @xmath74 and ` mass ' @xmath75 .",
    "note that if we let @xmath76 , the limit @xmath49 is just the limit @xmath77 , and what we have just done specialises to the familiar statement that the @xmath0 metric reduces to the reissner - nordstrm metric in this limit @xcite .",
    "we have assumed earlier that @xmath78 to avoid divergence in the conformal factor , but we could equally well have taken @xmath79 . then @xmath31 is interpreted as the cosmological horizon , @xmath32 is the outer black hole horizon , and @xmath80 is the inner black hole horizon .",
    "we now have to take @xmath81 to get a metric of the right signature .",
    "to make this metric regular , we must take @xmath41 to be periodic with period @xmath82 , and require @xmath83 this implies @xmath84 and thus @xmath85 .",
    "we have found that this occurs when @xmath86 , where @xmath87 ^ 2 [ ( r_++r_--\\gamma)^2 - 16 ( r_+-r_-)^2]}{4096 r_+^3 r_-^3},\\ ] ] and @xmath88 if we let @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , then @xmath91 where @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 therefore , if we make coordinate transformations @xmath95 and @xmath96 the metric becomes , in the limit @xmath59 , @xmath97.\\ ] ] if we make the further coordinate transformations @xmath98 the metric will become @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 the gauge field becomes @xmath102 in the magnetic case , and @xmath103 in the electric case . therefore , this can be identified as a reissner - nordstrm de sitter metric as well .",
    "note that although the equations are more complicated , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are still just functions of @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and @xmath104 is positive if @xmath106 and @xmath107 are positive .    if the cosmological constant",
    "is set to zero , we see that the @xmath0 metric is again only non - singular when it reduces to the reissner - nordstrm metric , that is , when the acceleration of the black holes vanishes",
    ". however , in this case , this happens for non - zero @xmath18 , as we can easily see from ( [ seta ] ) .",
    "this is just an indication that we should nt think of @xmath18 as simply parametrising the acceleration in this case .",
    "when the cosmological constant is set to zero , we have seen that the ordinary @xmath0 metric has no conical singularities when the acceleration vanishes , as we should have expected . however , when @xmath76 , we can eliminate the conical singularities in another way , as was first observed by dowker _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "it is now possible to set @xmath108 , as @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "again , the apparent degeneracy of the two roots is merely an artifact of our coordinate system .",
    "as explained in @xcite , we may make a transformation so that the metric remains regular when @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath0 metric is given by ( [ ccmet ] ) with @xmath76 .",
    "however , for consistency with @xcite , we will adopt a slightly different coordinate system in this section , and write the @xmath0 metric as @xmath112\\ ] ] with @xmath113(1+r_- a \\xi).\\ ] ] the transformation between the two forms of the @xmath0 metric is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the gauge field is still ( [ gauge1 ] ) or ( [ gauge2 ] ) .",
    "we will refer to the roots of @xmath114 as @xmath115 in ascending order .",
    "as before , @xmath33 is restricted to @xmath116 to obtain the appropriate signature .",
    "in fact , if @xmath117 , the appropriate range is actually @xmath118 , and the @xmath119 section becomes topologically @xmath120 . we can then obtain a regular solution by identifying @xmath41 with period @xmath121 .",
    "the two roots @xmath122 and @xmath123 will coincide when @xmath124 .",
    "following @xcite , we let @xmath125 , so that the limit of coincident roots is @xmath126 .",
    "if we make the coordinate transformation @xmath127 the metric is , in the limit @xmath59 , @xmath128,\\ ] ] where now @xmath129 and @xmath130 if we analytically continue @xmath131 , and identify @xmath132 with period @xmath133 , we obtain an instanton with topology @xmath134 , referred to as the type i instanton .",
    "it was not initially clear how to interpret this instanton .",
    "however , our experience with the cosmological @xmath0 metric above suggests that it is related to the reissner - nordstrm instanton .",
    "we are encouraged in this guess by the fact that the @xmath135 two - sphere sections are round .",
    "the range of @xmath33 in this solution is @xmath136 .",
    "let @xmath137 , and @xmath138 , so that @xmath65 has period @xmath66 , and the euclideanised metric becomes @xmath139.\\ ] ] if we make a further coordinate transformation , @xmath140 the metric becomes @xmath141 where @xmath142 the new parameters are @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "we also note that @xmath67 runs from @xmath145 to @xmath69 on the euclidean section .",
    "if the gauge field is ( [ gauge1 ] ) , it becomes @xmath146 and if it is ( [ gauge2 ] ) , it becomes @xmath147 where @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , this instanton is seen to be the euclidean reissner - nordstrm solution with charge @xmath105 and mass @xmath149 , with the magnetic instanton being identified with the electric reissner - nordstrm solution and vice - versa .",
    "thus we see again that eliminating the conical singularities is only possible when the @xmath0 metric reduces to reissner - nordstrm .",
    "however , the coordinate we analytically continued to obtain a euclidean section has been identified with the azimuthal coordinate in the euclidean reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "this means that the problem of understanding the physical significance , if any , of the @xmath0 metric in this special case is equivalent to giving a physical interpretation of the metric ( [ ern ] ) with @xmath150 . because @xmath151 is not analytically continued , this metric has one compact direction .",
    "this leads us to suspect that the interpretation is similar to that given for the five - dimensional black holes in @xcite ; that is , that this instanton should be interpreted as representing the decay of a kaluza - klein vacuum , @xmath152 .",
    "the analytically continued metric is @xmath153 where @xmath154 is given in ( [ vr ] ) .",
    "so long as the period @xmath155 around the compact direction is chosen appropriately , the coordinate singularity at @xmath156 is harmless .",
    "let us ignore for the moment the factors of @xmath154 , and consider just the three - dimensional space @xmath157 , that is , consider @xmath158 this metric describes a portion of three - dimensional minkowski space .",
    "in fact , if we make the coordinate transformations @xmath159 the metric ( [ 3metric ] ) becomes @xmath160 the usual metric on minkowski space .",
    "because @xmath161 is restricted to @xmath162 , the original coordinates only cover the part @xmath163 of the minkowski space ; however there is no obstruction to extending the solution to the whole of minkowski space .",
    "we could also set @xmath164 and rewrite this metric as @xmath165 now let us consider the effect of the factors of @xmath154 in ( [ newm ] ) .",
    "the metric ( [ newm ] ) approaches the product manifold @xmath166 asymptotically , but the coordinate @xmath67 is now restricted to @xmath167 .",
    "we can still make the same coordinate transformations , ( [ coord1],[coord3 ] ) .",
    "the resulting metric approaches ( [ mink2])@xmath168 asymptotically , but the restriction @xmath169 implies @xmath170 .",
    "note that it is not possible to continue the metric beyond @xmath156 , as the radius of the circle direction vanishes there .",
    "the physical interpretation is exactly the same as in @xcite : if we assume the radius of the circle direction is relatively small , putative observers living in this space who did nt go too close to @xmath171 would think ( [ newm ] ) described three - dimensional minkowski space with the interior of the hyperboloid @xmath172 omitted .",
    "the type i instanton should be interpreted as representing tunnelling from the vacuum ( [ mink2 ] ) cross a circle to ( [ newm ] ) ; that is , it describes the decay of a three - dimensional kaluza - klein vacuum .",
    "since the only special cases of the cosmological @xmath0 metrics for which the metric is regular reduce to the reissner - nordstrm de sitter metrics , consideration of the pair creation of charged black holes in a background with a positive cosmological constant reduces to a consideration of the non - singular instantons that can be constructed from the reissner - nordstrm de sitter metric .",
    "this question has of course been studied before , notably in @xcite , and in the uncharged case in @xcite , but we hope to present a unified picture which makes the relations between the instantons clear .",
    "the reissner - nordstrm de sitter metric is @xmath173 where @xmath174 the gauge field is @xmath175 for an electrically - charged solution , and @xmath176 for a magnetically - charged solution . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will not consider dyonic solutions .",
    "this solution has three independent parameters , the ` mass ' @xmath104 , charge @xmath105 and cosmological constant @xmath10 , which we will assume are all positive .",
    "there are then four roots of @xmath154 , which we designate by @xmath177 in ascending order .",
    "the first root is negative , and therefore has no physical significance .",
    "the remaining roots are interpreted as various horizons ; @xmath178 is the inner ( cauchy ) black hole horizon , @xmath179 is the outer ( killing ) black hole horizon , and @xmath180 is the cosmological ( acceleration ) horizon . in the lorentzian section , @xmath181 .",
    "we want to construct instantons from this metric by analytically continuing @xmath182 . to obtain a positive - definite metric",
    ", we must restrict @xmath67 to @xmath183 .",
    "there is then potentially a conical singularity at @xmath179 and at @xmath180 .",
    "however , if @xmath184 , the range of @xmath67 in the euclidean section will be @xmath185 , as the double root in @xmath154 implies that the proper distance from any other point to @xmath179 along spacelike directions is infinite . in this case",
    ", we may obtain a regular instanton by identifying @xmath151 periodically with period @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the surface gravity of the horizon @xmath180 .",
    "this instanton will be referred to as the cold instanton , following @xcite .",
    "if we do not have @xmath188 , then we must have @xmath189 and identify @xmath151 with the same period .",
    "there are two ways to satisfy this condition ; one is @xmath190 , which gives an instanton analogous to that constructed out of the nariai metric in @xcite , which we shall refer to as the charged nariai instanton .",
    "this is very similar to the way in which the type i instanton is obtained .",
    "the other is to set @xmath191 , which implies ( [ permat ] ) @xcite ; we shall refer to this as the lukewarm instanton , following @xcite .",
    "there is also a special case , when @xmath192 , which we refer to as the ultracold instanton , again following @xcite .",
    "the form of all these instantons in terms of the metric ( [ rns ] ) has been given in detail in @xcite ; we will briefly summarise that discussion here . if there is a double root @xmath193 of @xmath154 ,",
    "we can write @xmath194 and the mass and charge are thus given by @xmath195 @xmath196 for positive @xmath10 , the double root @xmath193 must lie in @xmath197 .",
    "the other positive root of @xmath198 is @xmath199 for @xmath200 , @xmath201 , so @xmath202 : this solution gives the cold instanton . for @xmath203 , @xmath204",
    ", so @xmath205 : this solution gives the charged nariai instanton .",
    "if @xmath206 , then @xmath207 : this solution gives the ultracold instanton .",
    "the function @xmath198 can also be rewritten as @xmath208 and we could also write @xmath209 and @xmath10 as functions of @xmath193 and @xmath210 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "if @xmath154 does not have a double root , then it must have two roots @xmath211 and @xmath212 such that @xmath213 this fixes @xmath154 to have the form @xmath214 from which one sees immediately that @xmath215 .",
    "we will now comment briefly on the nature of each of these instantons in turn .    for the lukewarm instanton ,",
    "the topology of the euclidean section is @xmath2 .",
    "the common temperature of the two horizons is @xcite @xmath216 the lorentzian section describes two black holes in de sitter space , so this instanton represents pair creation of non - extreme black holes in thermal equilibrium with the cosmological acceleration radiation . for the cold instantons ,",
    "the horizon at @xmath179 is at infinite distance , so the euclidean section has topology @xmath217 .",
    "there is a boundary @xmath218 at the internal infinity @xmath219 . in the calculation of the action",
    ", we will take the boundary to lie at @xmath220 , and then take the limit as @xmath59 , that is , as the boundary approaches @xmath221 .",
    "the relation between the charge and mass is given parametrically by ( [ mrho],[qrho ] ) , and is displayed on figure 1 .",
    "the temperature of the horizon at @xmath180 is @xcite @xmath222 the lorentzian section describes two extreme black holes in de sitter space , so this instanton represents pair creation of extreme black holes in thermal equilibrium with the acceleration radiation . for the charged nariai instantons , where @xmath190",
    ", it is necessary to make a coordinate transformation and rewrite the metric as @xcite @xmath223 where @xmath18 and @xmath224 are constants , with @xmath225 , @xmath161 and @xmath70 run from @xmath68 to @xmath71 , and @xmath226 and @xmath65 are periodic coordinates with period @xmath66 .",
    "the gauge field becomes @xmath227 in the magnetic case , and @xmath228 in the electric case .",
    "the cosmological constant is @xmath229 , while @xmath230 , and @xmath104 and @xmath105 are given by ( [ mrho],[qrho ] ) .",
    "this instanton has topology @xmath231 ; indeed , it is just the direct product of two round two - spheres with different radii .",
    "the relation between the mass and charge is still given parametrically by ( [ mrho],[qrho ] ) , and is also displayed on figure 1 .",
    "however , although this solution is just a special case of reissner - nordstrm de sitter , we find that the singularity retreats to infinite proper distance when @xmath232 , and so there is no longer a global event horizon , and the lorentzian section is just the direct product of two - dimensional de sitter space and a two - sphere of fixed radius , ds@xmath233 .",
    "thus the instanton does nt represent pair creation of black holes .",
    "however , as in @xcite , higher - order quantum corrections will break the degeneracy of the two roots , so the charged nariai solution will revert to an ordinary reissner - nordstrm de sitter spacetime once these effects are included .",
    "the ultracold case deserves a more detailed description . in this case",

    "the lorentzian metric obtained by taking @xmath253 represents mink@xmath254 in rindler coordinates ; the horizon at @xmath255 is the rindler horizon .",
    "alternatively , we could define @xmath33 by @xmath256 and take @xmath257 then @xmath258 and the metric in the limit @xmath59 is @xmath259 this instanton also has topology @xmath134 , but the internal infinity @xmath218 now has two components , @xmath260 .",
    "we will evaluate the action for a region bounded by @xmath261 , and then take @xmath262 .",

    "there is an interesting analogy between the situation here and the ernst instantons ; with the ernst solution , there are also three ways in which a non - singular instanton can be achieved .",
    "these are the non - extreme ( or type ii ) instanton , the extreme instanton , and the type i instanton @xcite . the lukewarm solution",
    "may be thought of as the analogue of the non - extreme instanton , the cold solution as the analogue of the extreme instanton , and the charged nariai solution as the analogue of the type i instanton .",
    "the plots of mass versus charge for the reissner - nordstrm de sitter and ernst instantons are given in figure 1 and figure 2 respectively . while the numerical values are not the same , the qualitative features of these two plots are strikingly similar .",
    "in the previous section , we presented the euclidean solutions which provide the instantons for pair creation of charged black holes in a cosmological background .",
    "we will now review their interpretation as instantons , and use them to obtain approximate rates for these processes .",
    "the pair creation of non - extreme charged black holes in a cosmological background is described by propagation from nothing to a surface @xmath13 with topology @xmath270 , since such a surface may be thought of as a wheeler wormhole attached to an @xmath17 , and @xmath17 is the topology of the spatial sections of de sitter space .",
    "the pair creation of extreme charged black holes is similarly described by propagation to a surface with topology @xmath271 . in this case",
    "there is also a boundary component @xmath221 , which represents an `` internal infinity '' .",
    "we will use @xmath13 to denote the whole boundary in this case , and @xmath272 to denote the part with topology @xmath271 .",
    "the amplitude for these processes will , at least formally , be given by a path integral ; @xmath273 d[a ] e^{-i}.\\ ] ] the integral is over all metrics and gauge fields which agree with the given boundary data on @xmath13 , and @xmath132 may thus be thought of as a functional of the boundary data .",
    "we assume that , if there is a euclidean classical solution which interpolates within the given boundary , then the integral is dominated by the contribution from it .",
    "that is , if there is an appropriate instanton , @xmath132 will be approximately @xmath274 where @xmath5 is the action of this instanton .",
    "the partition function , and thus the pair creation rate , is given by the square of this amplitude .",
    "a spatial section of the lukewarm solution has topology @xmath275 , so half of the euclidean section provides an instanton for the pair creation of non - extreme charged black holes .",
    "we have to use half of the solution , as we want the extrinsic curvature of @xmath13 to vanish , so that @xmath13 can be interpreted as the zero - momentum initial data for the lorentzian extension .",
    "similarly , half of the cold solution can be used as an instanton to describe the pair creation of extreme charged black holes . note that these instantons only exist when the data on @xmath13 specified in the path integral agrees with the data induced by the solutions .",
    "the whole of the euclidean section in each case provides a `` bounce '' solution . in asymptotically - flat situations",
    ", one can deal with the bounces rather than the instantons , but in a cosmological situation this is no longer possible , as the boundary data on the surface @xmath13 provide crucial information @xcite",
    ". we will therefore be interested in the calculation of the action for the instantons .",
    "we also need to consider what action we should use in the calculation of ( [ v0 ] ) .",
    "we want to use the action for which it is natural to fix the boundary data on @xmath13 specified in the path integral ( [ pint ] ) .",
    "that is , we want to use an action whose variation gives the euclidean equations of motion when the variation fixes these boundary data on @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "if we consider the action ( [ emac ] ) , we can see that its variation will be @xmath276 where @xmath277 is the normal to @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the induced metric on @xmath13 ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the gravitational boundary terms ) .",
    "thus , the variation of ( [ emac ] ) will only give the equations of motion if the variation is at fixed gauge potential on the boundary , @xmath278 .",
    "note that it is not necessary to fix the component @xmath279 normal to the boundary .    for the magnetic reissner - nordstrm solutions , fixing the gauge potential fixes the charge on each of the black holes , as the magnetic charge is just given by the integral of @xmath280 over a two - sphere lying in the boundary .",
    "however , in the electric case , fixing the gauge potential @xmath278 can be regarded as fixing a chemical potential @xmath281 which is conjugate to the charge @xcite .",
    "holding the charge fixed in the electric case is equivalent to fixing @xmath282 on the boundary , as the electric charge is given by the integral of the dual of @xmath283 over a two - sphere lying in the boundary .",
    "therefore , the appropriate action is @xmath284 as its variation is @xmath285 and so it gives the equations of motion when @xmath286 , and thus the electric charge , is held fixed .",
    "let us consider the pair creation where the electric and magnetic charge are held fixed on @xmath13 .",
    "then the appropriate action will be ( [ emac ] ) in the magnetic case , and ( [ elac ] ) in the electric case .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that , since we identify @xmath13 ( @xmath272 in the cold case ) with a surface of zero extrinsic curvature in the euclidean section , the gravitational boundary term in the action ( [ emac ] ) will make no contribution to the action .",
    "thus the action ( [ emac ] ) for the instanton will just be half that of the whole euclidean section",
    ".    we will now consider each of the instantons derived in section [ instsec ] , and calculate the actions ( [ emac ] ) in the magnetic case and ( [ elac ] ) in the electric case .",
    "for the lukewarm solution we have , in the magnetic case , @xmath287 , and thus the action ( [ emac ] ) is @xcite @xmath288 where @xmath289 is the four - volume of the instanton , and @xmath290 is the period of @xmath151 . in the electric case , @xmath291 , and we find that ( [ emac ] ) gives @xmath292 to calculate the additional boundary term in ( [ elac ] ) , we have to pick a gauge for the maxwell field . to obtain a unique result",
    ", we have to constrain the gauge choice to be regular at both horizons .",
    "a suitable gauge choice for the lukewarm solution is @xmath293 it might seem that this gauge choice involves a discontinuity at the horizons , but in fact it does not . to consider whether there is a discontinuity at the horizon , we should look at the gauge potential in orthonormal coordinates .",
    "an orthonormal frame for the metric ( [ rns ] ) is @xmath294 and the gauge potential ( [ lgauge ] ) is @xmath295 which vanishes at @xmath179 and @xmath180 .    to evaluate the additional boundary term in ( [ elac ] ) , we take a coordinate system such that the boundary is the surface @xmath296 in the euclidean section , and we take the integral in the @xmath67 direction on the boundary to run from the black hole horizon to the acceleration horizon along @xmath297 , and back along @xmath298 .",
    "the additional term is @xmath299 and thus the action ( [ elac ] ) in the electric case is @xmath300 the relevant action is thus the same for the electric and magnetic lukewarm instantons .",
    "it lies in the range @xmath301 , as @xmath302 .    for the cold solution , @xmath303 in the magnetic solution , and the action ( [ emac ] )",
    "is @xmath304 there is also an extrinsic curvature boundary term at @xmath221 , but this vanishes . in the electric case , @xmath305",
    ", so the action ( [ emac ] ) is @xmath306 a suitable gauge potential , which is regular everywhere on the instanton , is @xmath307 the integral over @xmath13 now consists of two parts ; there is an integral over the @xmath271 factor , which we take to be from @xmath308 to the acceleration horizon at @xmath309 along @xmath310 , and back along @xmath311 , and an integral over the internal infinity @xmath312 , which is in the direction of _ decreasing _ @xmath151 .",
    "the additional boundary term in ( [ elac ] ) is @xmath313 and thus ( [ elac ] ) is @xmath314 again , the action is the same in the electric and magnetic cases .",
    "it lies in the range @xmath315 .",
    "the actions in the charged nariai case have already been computed in @xcite . in the magnetic case , @xmath316 , and the action ( [ emac ] ) is @xmath317 in the electric case , @xmath318",
    ", so the action ( [ emac ] ) is @xmath319 a suitable gauge potential is @xmath320 we take the boundary to be the surface @xmath321 , and integrate from the black hole horizon ( @xmath322 ) to the acceleration horizon ( @xmath323 ) along @xmath324 , and back along @xmath325 , so the additional boundary term in ( [ elac ] ) is @xmath326 and thus ( [ elac ] ) is @xmath327 the relevant action is the same in the electric and magnetic cases , and it lies in the range @xmath328 .    for both metrics which can be constructed in the ultracold case , @xmath329 in the magnetic solution , so the volume contribution to the action ( [ emac ] ) vanishes .",
    "let us consider first the metric ( [ uc1 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath330 in the electric solution , @xmath331 , so ( [ emac ] ) gives @xmath332 ( the boundary @xmath218 in this case is the surface @xmath247 ) .",
    "one could take the electric gauge potential to be @xmath333 we define @xmath13 to be the surfaces @xmath334 , together with the semi - circle at @xmath247 lying between them , and take the integral around the boundary to be from @xmath247 to @xmath255 along @xmath324 , back along @xmath325 , and around @xmath247 in the direction of decreasing @xmath226 .",
    "the additional boundary term in ( [ elac ] ) is @xmath335 so ( [ elac ] ) is @xmath336 this action agrees with the limit of the action of the cold solution as it approaches ultracold .",
    "if we consider instead the metric ( [ uc2 ] ) , the action vanishes in the magnetic case , @xmath337 , as the extrinsic curvature surface term at @xmath338 vanishes as well . in the electric case ,",
    "@xmath339 , so if we consider the action for the region between two surfaces @xmath340 , ( [ emac ] ) gives @xmath341 one could take the electric gauge potential to be @xmath342 the additional boundary term in ( [ elac ] ) is then @xmath343 so ( [ elac ] ) vanishes as well , @xmath344 .    one can use the action of an instanton to approximate the wavefunction for the propagation to some final surface , so the action gives the approximate amplitude at which this process occurs .",
    "one can square this to get the rate .",
    "the actions we have just calculated for the cold and lukewarm instantons give the rate for pair creation of black holes in a cosmological background by these instantons .",
    "the pair creation rate is approximately @xmath345 in each case , where @xmath5 is the relevant action .",
    "since de sitter space has action @xmath346 , which is the lower bound of the action for the cold and lukewarm instantons , the rate at which black hole pairs are created relative to the rate at which de sitter space is itself created is less than one . that is",
    ", the pair creation of black holes is suppressed .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "since the instantons are all cosmological solutions , there is no asymptotic region in the euclidean section ( that is , there is no ` point at infinity ' ) .",
    "this can be interpreted as meaning that these solutions are closed systems , and thus necessarily have fixed energy .",
    "they should therefore be interpreted as a contribution to the microcanonical ensemble , as this is the thermodynamical ensemble at fixed energy .",
    "the partition function @xmath347 should therefore be interpreted as the density of states , and thus the entropy will be just the ln of this partition function , @xmath348 @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the entropy from the instantons is thus just @xmath349 as we might expect , the entropy turns out to be just a quarter of the total area of the horizons which appear in the instanton ( which we denote by @xmath350 ) . in the lukewarm case , there are two horizons , at @xmath179 and @xmath180 , so @xmath351 , but @xmath352,\\ ] ] so @xmath353 and thus @xmath354 in the cold case , only the acceleration horizon at @xmath309 is part of the instanton , and it has area @xmath355 , so @xmath356 in the charged nariai case , there are again two horizons , which both have area @xmath357 .",
    "thus @xmath358 , and @xmath359 for the first type of ultracold solution , ( [ uc1 ] ) , the surface @xmath255 is interpreted as a rindler horizon , which has area @xmath360 .",
    "thus , @xmath361 for the other type of ultracold solution , there are no horizons , and the entropy vanishes , @xmath362 , as we expect .",
    "thus we see that horizons contribute to the gravitational entropy only if they are in the instanton ; in particular , extreme black hole horizons make no contribution to the entropy , even if they have non - zero area , as discovered in @xcite .",
    "thus , the usual relation between the entropy and the area of the horizons extends to all these solutions . just as for the ernst instantons , the pair creation of extreme black holes",
    "is suppressed relative to the pair creation of non - extreme black holes by a factor of @xmath363 , where @xmath364 is the entropy associated with the black hole horizon .",
    "the pair creation of charged black holes by a strong electromagnetic field has been a subject of considerable recent interest .",
    "we have seen that charged black holes can also be pair created in a background with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "the nature of the instantons describing this pair creation is very similar to that of the instantons describing pair creation in an electromagnetic field .",
    "there is a non - extreme and an extreme instanton . as in the electromagnetic case ,",
    "the pair creation of extreme black holes is suppressed relative to that of non - extreme black holes by a factor of @xmath363 , where @xmath364 is the entropy associated with the black hole horizon .",
    "this is further evidence that @xmath363 should be regarded as the number of internal states of the black holes .",
    "the pair creation rate obtained from the instantons is in fact just @xmath365 , where @xmath366 is the total gravitational entropy of the instanton , that is , a quarter the area of the black hole and the cosmological horizons . seen from this point of view , black hole pair creation in de sitter space is suppressed simply because de sitter space has a higher entropy ; that is , the single horizon of de sitter space has an area larger than the combined area of the horizons in the instantons .",
    "this is also similar to the electromagnetic case , where the pair creation rate was @xmath367 in the non - extreme case , with the suppression being due to the fact that the difference in acceleration horizon area @xmath368 was negative .    because the conical singularities in the charged @xmath0 metric with a cosmological constant can only be eliminated when it reduces to the reissner - nordstrm de sitter metric , we are fairly confident that the instantons we have described in this paper are the only ones which can be interpreted as representing pair creation of charged black holes in a cosmological background",
    ". it might be interesting to see if these solutions could be extended to dilaton gravity with some kind of effective cosmological constant , as the presence of the dilaton field might allow some more possibilities .",
    "we have also observed that the type i instanton discovered in @xcite , where the conical singularities in the ordinary charged @xmath0 metric are eliminated by allowing @xmath369 and @xmath122 to coincide , is in fact the reissner - nordstrm metric .",
