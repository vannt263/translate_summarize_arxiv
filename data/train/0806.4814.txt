    "the @xmath3ni@xmath8b@xmath8c ( @xmath3=dy , ho , er , tm ) family of ternary superconductors attracts attention @xcite because superconductivity and long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order compete in these materials and their superconducting ( sc ) properties exhibit often unconventional behavior .",
    "it turned out also that a multiband approach is required to describe properly sc properties of @xmath3=y and lu nickel borocarbides as it was shown in @xcite .",
    "additionally , the af order has its own specific features in each of the title compounds , e.g. , along with different nel temperature @xmath9 the af order can be in- or commensurate @xcite .",
    "the manifestation of the mentioned extraordinary behavior of @xmath3ni@xmath8b@xmath8c is intimately dependent on the chemical composition and crystal perfectness , therefore continuous progress in synthesis of high quality single crystal samples leads to deeper understanding of their fundamental physics . in this paper",
    "we overview the efforts in point - contact ( pc ) studies of the sc gap in the title compounds based on very recent research ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the pc method @xcite allows to study the directional , temperature and magnetic field dependence of the sc gap which can provide insight into the sc ground state of @xmath3ni@xmath8b@xmath8c and its interplay with magnetic order .",
    "here we will focus on results measured on the best single crystals reported so far .",
    "honi@xmath8b@xmath8c ( @xmath10 5.2k @xmath11 8.5k ) and tmni@xmath8b@xmath8c ( @xmath10 1.5k @xmath12 10.5k ) crystals were grown by a floating zone technique with optical heating at ifw dresden , while erni@xmath8b@xmath8c ( @xmath13 6k @xmath12 11k ) and dyni@xmath8b@xmath8c ( @xmath13 10.5k @xmath14 6.5k ) were grown at ames laboratory ( usa ) by a ni@xmath8b high - temperature flux growth method .",
    "pcs were established at the liquid helium temperature by standard `` needle - anvil '' methods @xcite , using as a `` needle '' a sharpened piece of cu or ag .",
    "the sc gap was evaluated from the measured @xmath15 dependences of pcs applying both the standard btk theory and an akin theory ( in the case of er ) , which considered the pair - breaking effect of magnetic impurities @xcite . for @xmath3=er pcs . in this case instead of the sc gap the sc order parameter ( op ) @xmath16 is evaluated while the sc gap @xmath17(1-@xmath18 , here @xmath19 is pair - breaking parameter .",
    "forasmuch as @xmath19 variates at our op evaluation below 0.1 , the gap has similar behavior like op , shown in fig.3 for @xmath3=er .",
    "therefore , for uniformity we used definition `` one - gap '' or `` two - gap '' fit , although in the case of @xmath3=er a notation `` two - op '' fit is more adequate . ]",
    "this is reasonably for the mentioned borocarbides because of the presence of magnetic moments on the rare - earth ions .",
    "gap behavior in tmni@xmath8b@xmath8c established by a btk fit of pc @xmath0 curves .",
    "the dashed curve shows qualitatively the b@xmath20 behavior in tmni@xmath8b@xmath8c along the c - axis .",

    "the dashed curve shows qualitatively the b@xmath20 behavior in tmni@xmath8b@xmath8c along the c - axis .",
    "inset : example of a @xmath0 curve at 1.6k . ]",
    "the sc gap @xmath21 manifests itself on the @xmath0 characteristic of a normal metal - superconductor pc by pronounced minima symmetrically placed at @xmath22/e if @xmath23 t@xmath24 ( see inset in fig.1 ) .",
    "the measured @xmath0 of the title compounds exhibit one pair of minima as in the case of single gap superconductors @xcite , therefore a single gap approach is usually used to fit experimental data .",
    "it is seen from the inset in fig.1 that the one - gap fit reasonably describes @xmath0 for @xmath3=ho .",
    "the same is true for @xmath3=dy @xcite ( not shown ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath25 in fig.1 exhibits a bcs - like @xmath26dependence in both cases , however , @xmath25 vanishes at @xmath26*@xmath275.6k for @xmath3=ho , a few k below the bulk critical temperature @xmath28 8.5k .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that superconductivity in the commensurate af phase in the @xmath3=ho compound survives at a special nearly isotropic fermi surface sheet , while the gap suppression at @xmath26 * may be caused by a peculiar magnetic order developing in this compound above the af state at @xmath135.2k .",
    "interesting peculiar behavior of @xmath29 in tmni@xmath8b@xmath8c ( fig.2 ) was found recently @xcite .",
    "the sc gap has a maximum around 4 - 5k and further decreases at lowering temperature .",
    "this is in accord with the behavior of the upper critical field along the c - axis .",
    "apparently , af fluctuations occurring above the magnetically ordered state at @xmath30 = 1.5k are responsible for the decrease of the sc gap observed at low temperatures .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , the `` one - gap '' approach to fit the measured high - quality @xmath0 curves looks like a smooth curve with pronounced ar minima ( see inset in fig.3 ) while some irregularities like e.g. spike - like structures above the minima ( see inset in fig.1 ) are absent . ] for erni@xmath8b@xmath8c results in a clear discrepancy between the fit and the data at the minima position and at zero bias . at the same time",
    ", a `` two - gap '' approach allows a better fit of @xmath0 for erni@xmath8b@xmath8c @xcite .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the upper critical field @xmath31 of nonmagnetic borocarbides @xmath3=y and lu @xcite can be properly described only by a two - band model .",
    "therefore , the detection of two sc gaps in magnetic erni@xmath32b@xmath32c ( with about the same magnitude as in @xmath3=lu @xcite ) from one hand testifies for similarities in the electronic band structure of the mentioned compounds , from the other hand it points to the fact that superconductivity and magnetism develop in erni@xmath32b@xmath32c in different bands .    the sc gap or op ( for @xmath3=er & lu ) established by a pc study vs t@xmath24 in @xmath3ni@xmath8b@xmath8c including also the nonmagnetic compounds @xmath3=y and lu .",
    "]    the sc gap or op ( for @xmath3=er & lu ) established by a pc study vs t@xmath24 in @xmath3ni@xmath8b@xmath8c including also the nonmagnetic compounds @xmath3=y and lu . ]    from the @xmath26dependence of the sc order parameter ( op ) in erni@xmath8b@xmath8c ( fig.3 ) is clearly seen that both ops start to decrease by approaching or below t@xmath33 .",
    "a similar decrease of the sc gap in erni@xmath8b@xmath8c in the af state was reported by stm measurements in @xcite and , recently , by laser - photoemission spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "such a gap decrease in the af state is also in line with the machida theory @xcite in which spin - density - wave ordering competes with superconductivity .    on the other hand , @xmath34 in erni@xmath8b@xmath8c above @xmath9",
    "is close to the bcs - like behavior , only the steep vanishing of the larger op at @xmath35 is rather unexpected .",
    "it turned out @xcite that the contribution of the larger op to @xmath36 is also temperature dependent decreasing with increasing temperature and containing only about 10% close to @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , it seems that the larger op disappears at @xmath35 due to a `` shrinking '' of the corresponding sc part of the fermi surface .",
    "it should be noted that the magnetic structure in @xmath3=er and tm compounds is given by an incommensurate spin density wave . as it is seen from fig.2 ,",
    "@xmath25 for tmni@xmath8b@xmath8c deviates from the bcs behavior approaching @xmath9 .",
    "contrary , ho and dy compounds with commensurate af order display a bcs - like gap .",
    "of course , in the case of @xmath3=tm measurements below t@xmath371.5k are very desirable to trace similarity with the er compound .",
    "fig.4 summarizes the measured sc gap / op by pcs in the title compounds . in general , the sc gap / op values are close to the bcs value @xmath38=1.76 k@xmath39 taking into account the multiband behavior in the er  compound and the vanishing of the sc gap in @xmath3=ho at @xmath405.6k . for comparison , also the sc gaps of the nonmagnetic compounds @xmath3=y and lu are presented in fig.4 .",
    "a two - gap state is established for @xmath3=lu @xcite and a strong anisotropy of the gap ( probably due to multiband state ) is observed for @xmath3=y @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the ops in er and lu compounds have close values , but in the case of er the larger op contribution to @xmath0 dominates at low temperature . however , then this contribution decreases ( by a factor 5 ) with increasing temperature @xcite , while for @xmath3=lu a similar behavior is observed for the smaller op @xcite .",
    "the sc gap ( sc op ) was studied using normal metal - superconductor pcs for a series of magnetic rare - earth nickel borocarbide superconductors . for the first time , the existence of two sc ops in the magnetic compound erni@xmath32b@xmath32c has been shown . moreover , a distinct decrease of the both ops is observed as the temperature is lowered below @xmath9 . for the @xmath3= ho and dy compounds with commensurate af order , the sc gap has a bcs like behavior in the af state , while for @xmath3=tm the gap starts to decrease by approaching a magnetic state with incommensurate af order .",
    "note that the @xmath3=er compound has an incommensurate af order and the ops also start to decrease slightly above @xmath9 at lowering temperature .",
    "thus , the discrepancy in the magnetically ordered state between @xmath3=ho , dy ( commensurate state ) and @xmath3=er , tm ( incommensurate state ) results in a different sc gap ( or op ) behaviors .",
    "more extensive directional pc measurements for @xmath3=dy , ho and tm are desirable to check the presence of multi - gap superconductivity in these compounds as well .",
