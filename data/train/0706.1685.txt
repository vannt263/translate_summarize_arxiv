    "the biology and physics @xcite communities have pursued overlapping studies of membranes over the past few decades , with the natural segmentation into more specific ( biological ) and general ( physics ) studies .",
    "the physicists are often entranced by the variety of topological and phase behaviours possible in membranes . however , with new experimental techniques that include better visualization of dynamical processes in cells , there are increasingly more opportunities for interdisciplinary cross - fertilization .",
    "plasmon modes have been found @xcite in a system of electrons on the surface of liquid helium , that play a fundamental role in understanding the properties of a metal in condensed matter .",
    "plasmons have been investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite in quasi @xmath3 systems such as surfaces or interfaces of metals .",
    "lipid bilayers are among the most important `` construction materials '' for the cell @xcite .",
    "a bilayer membrane constitutes a flexible barrier that separates the interior and exterior of a cell , encapsulates the nucleus and can perform a number of roles such as acting as a functional host for protein production .",
    "membranes appear in flat ( plasma membrane ) , spherical ( vesicular transport ) , tubular ( transport ) or tortuous and possibly bicontinuous ( endoplasmic reticulum , er and golgi apparatus ) forms in the cell , depending on function and composition .",
    "the surface of a lipid bilayer with the surrounding counter - ion system is analogous to that of electrons on helium surface .",
    "the surface of a cell membrane in aqueous environment becomes negatively charged @xcite .",
    "it is well known @xcite that a diffuse double layer of counter - ions from the solution screens the negative charge , thus , a thin two - dimensional @xmath4 layer of mobile cations is accumulated adjacent to the extracellular and intra - cellular membrane surfaces .",
    "in addition , because of different permeabilities of the cell membrane channels to various cations , the inside of the cell is kept at a negative potential relative to the outside .",
    "the gating mechanism of ion channels along the cell membrane , that are believed to open using voltage sensing gates , is an open problem in cell biology @xcite .",
    "recently , the collective charge response of the mobile counter - ion charge of the interior and exterior surface layers to an external electric field perturbation have been studied by e.  manousakis @xcite . following a complicated approach",
    ", one have to solve the poisson equation for the perturbation field due to the external charge density and current fluctuations , one obtained the expressions of the frequencies of plasmon oscillations of each layer .",
    "it is shown that there are longitudinal charge collective modes with wave vectors parallel to the surface and the two layers are coupled and fluctuate together as a whole in the limit where the wavelength is much longer than the membrane thickness @xmath1 .    in this work we introduce a simple model for the membrane collective charge excitations .",
    "the formulae of the frequencies of plasmon oscillations are obtained by using the bogoliubov transformation method .",
    "the negatively charged exterior and interior surfaces at biological membranes of cells is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] where the density of charged phospholipids heads is higher on the exterior membrane surface than interior one .",
    "diffuse double layers of counter - ions , such as h@xmath5 , na@xmath5 , k@xmath5 , ca@xmath6 ... , form on each membrane side . due to the difference membrane permeability for these cations",
    ", there is a voltage @xmath7 between the cell interior relative to the exterior .",

    "we consider a simplest case where all the parameters of both layers are taken to be the same i.e. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "the frequency @xmath54 corresponds to in - phase charge oscillations of the two layers and the frequency @xmath55 to out - of - phase charge oscillations .    in order to obtain a more accurate expression of the plasmon frequencies instead of the bare mass and surface density",
    ", one should use the effective mass of the hydrated ion and the effective nearly - free counterion charge density . if there are binding sites on the membrane surface this will reduce the effective free surface charge density .",
    "the plasmon frequencies should scale as @xmath56 with respect to surface concentrations ( which can be estimated from the bulk concentrations ) and as @xmath57 with respect to various counter - ion - effective masses .",
    "these plasmon oscillations can be used by the various parts of cell membrane to carry out communication .",
    "the investigations of the behavior of the gates of the voltage sensitive ion channels in cell membranes indicate a high sensitively of the voltage sensor to small changes of the membrane electric field .",
    "this implies that the @xmath3 plasmas could play a role in triggering the bio - sensor operations .",
    "before , however , one proceeds further to study such possibilities it is important to carry out an experimental study to verify the existence and the properties of these plasmon modes .",
    "in this work we investigated the effects of the surface effective potential due to the existence of the charge carries at bounders of the bio systems , this problem can be simplified by considering the plasmon oscillations of each layer in cell membranes as a quasi - particle .",
    "we studied a theoretical model for plasmons modes of the cell membranes , by using bogoliubov transformation method , we obtained the formulae of eigen - frequencies of the membrane collective charge oscillations , the results are in good agreement with ones obtained from previous theories .",
    "this simple model could be applied for another bio , nano and soft material systems .",
