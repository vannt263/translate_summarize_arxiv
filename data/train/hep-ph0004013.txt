    "the increasing experimental precision at present and future colliders requires fast progress in the calculation of higher order corrections from the theoretical side . a crucial role is thereby played by the calculation of multi - loop integrals , which becomes an increasingly challenging task as the number of loops and the number of kinematic invariants gets larger .    in the case of two - point functions ,",
    "up to four loop orders could be evaluated  @xcite by exploiting the integration - by - parts method  @xcite and recurrence relations .",
    "this powerful technique also has been generalized to calculate three - loop propagator - type diagrams in heavy quark effective theory  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the presence of only one kinematic invariant allowed for the calculation of two - loop three - point functions  @xcite , which could be applied to compute the partonic cross sections for dis and the drell - yan process to nnlo  @xcite . physical processes with a more difficult kinematic structure could not be computed to two - loop order yet , amplitudes exist only for very special cases  @xcite .",
    "a major reason is that two - loop integrals with four external legs , involving more than one kinematic variable , constitute a more complex problem . only very recently",
    ", the analytic calculation of the massless planar  @xcite and non - planar  @xcite double box could be achieved by using mellin - barnes integration techniques .",
    "furthermore , results for single - box integrals with self - energy and vertex insertions have been given in  @xcite and techniques based on differential equations to reduce two - loop four point functions to a set of master integrals have been derived in  @xcite .",
    "the tensor reduction of massless double box integrals has been completed in  @xcite , where the second master integral needed in the reduction of crossed two - loop boxes is given .",
    "however , it is not clear at the moment whether the techniques developed so far are sufficient to solve more complicated higher order problems as well .    hence , to obtain results for integrals which are beyond the scope of analytic integration methods , but also as a simple check of involved analytic calculations , it is desirable to have a method at hand which allows the calculation of multi - loop integrals numerically . for two - loop box integrals with internal masses , thus with no infrared divergence , semi - numerical approaches have been designed in  @xcite .",
    "the massless case requires a different approach because of the presence of infrared divergences , which first have to be extracted from the integral in order to make it amenable to numerical evaluation .",
    "in perturbative qcd , the calculation of infrared safe quantities has to be organized such that the infrared poles stemming from virtual and real higher order corrections cancel . at next - to - leading order usually semi",
    "- analytical methods are used to achieve this cancelation . as an alternative",
    ", a completely numerical method has been developed in  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm allows for the summation of the contributions from different cuts of a graph _ before _ integration , such that the cancelation of soft and collinear divergences is built in as imposed by unitarity .",
    "nevertheless , since the method requires the deformation of the multi - dimensional integration contours to avoid fake singularities , its general applicability to nnlo calculations is highly nontrivial .",
    "hence a general _ local _ subtraction procedure to separate infrared divergences from _ individual _ graphs of arbitrary loop order would be very useful .",
    "the ir singularity structure of higher - loop feynman diagrams was investigated in @xcite in four dimensions , and later in  @xcite in the context of dimensional regularization and factorization in qcd .",
    "working in dimensional regularization , subtraction procedures are well known for uv poles , and also for ir divergences present in euclidean space ( see e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand , no general subtraction scheme for soft and collinear ir singularities arising in minkowski space",
    "is known for individual graphs .",
    "the method we present in this paper has been designed to isolate poles in the dimensional regulator @xmath1 for an arbitrary feynman graph .",
    "although the method also works for one - loop integrals , its virtues show up rather in two or higher loop integrals with @xmath5 external legs , at least one of them being massless .",
    "it allows one to disentangle overlapping soft and collinear divergent regions in feynman parameter space by dividing the latter into sectors where parameters can get singular only in an independent manner .",
    "then , by adding and subtracting adequate counterterms , one can isolate the singular parts and perform the integrations over the corresponding parameters analytically .",
    "the remaining regular integrals are in general too complex for analytical integration , but they can be integrated numerically .",
    "this procedure is quite general and can in principle be applied to graphs with an arbitrary number of loops and legs , the limitations being only disk space and computing time .",
    "the algorithm can be divided into four blocks . in the first one , the @xmath6-distribution constraint on the feynman parameters is eliminated in a particular way and in the second one",
    ", the singular contributions are isolated in parameter space .",
    "the third block consists of a subtraction procedure for the @xmath7 poles , producing a set @xmath8 of finite functions of the feynman parameters as coefficients of each order@xmath9 pole . in the fourth block",
    ", the integrations over the feynman parameters in these functions are performed .",
    "the coefficient functions of the leading and subleading pole of a graph are in general simple enough to be integrated analytically with an algebraic manipulation program , whereas the remaining functions have to be integrated numerically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section two ,",
    "we outline the algorithm . in section three ,",
    "some examples are given in order to show the applicability of the method to quite different types of integrals .",
    "first we treat some two - loop four - point functions with one external leg off - shell as an example for a three - scale problem which could not be solved analytically yet . then",
    "three - loop three - point graphs with two external legs on - shell and eight and nine propagators , respectively , are calculated .",
    "section four contains a discussion of available analytical / numerical results for elements entering the calculation of various processes of phenomenological relevance , pointing out where our method improves the situation .",
    "in this section we describe the algorithm to treat a general @xmath10dimensional scalar @xmath11loop feynman diagram with @xmath12 propagators .",
    "if @xmath13 is the number of external legs with momenta @xmath14 , @xmath11 the number of loop momenta @xmath15 , @xmath16 the ( not necessarily nonzero ) masses of the propagators @xmath17 , and @xmath18 $ ] , a general scalar feynman diagram @xmath19 can be written as @xmath20 in the present paper we will not deal with powers of propagators different from one .",
    "nevertheless , higher ( and even non - integer ) powers of propagators can be treated with basically the same algorithm . introducing feynman parameters , the integral",
    "can be expressed in terms of a symmetric @xmath21matrix @xmath22 , an @xmath11-vector @xmath23 ( with 4-vectors in each component ) and a scalar function @xmath24 .",
    "the contraction of lorentz indices is indicated by a dot .",
    "@xmath25^{-n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after having shifted the loop momenta to get rid of the linear term , one obtains after momentum integration the following parameter representation of the graph @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath26\\label{def : f}\\\\ { \\cal u}(\\vec x ) & = & \\det ( m ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as is well known , the parametric representation is determined by two functions which we call @xmath27 and @xmath28 . they are defined by the topology of the corresponding feynman diagram @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 contains the mandelstam variables related to the different cuts of the graph .",
    "a necessary condition for the presence of infrared divergences is that the landau equations  @xcite are fulfilled . a representation of the landau equations following from eq .",
    "( [ eq_mixed_rep ] ) is given by @xmath29 the function @xmath27 can not lead to infrared divergences of the graph , since giving a mass to all external legs would not change @xmath27 . apart from the fact that the graph may have an overall uv divergence contained in the overall @xmath30-function ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : param_rep ] ) ) , uv subdivergences may also be present .",
    "a necessary condition for these is the vanishing of @xmath27 . in this way",
    "the uv poles can be identified and treated according to standard renormalization procedures .",
    "infrared poles in @xmath31 come from the parameter region where some feynman parameters are small such that @xmath28 vanishes .",
    "the feynman parameter integrations which lead to poles can be related to a kinematical configuration in momentum space by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : landau_eq ] ) .",
    "the ir poles come from soft and/or collinear momentum configurations where propagators do not describe virtual particles anymore but rather the propagation of an on - shell particle together with eventual splittings .",
    "the soft / collinear poles of multi  loop graphs are the result of such kinematical situations in loop momentum space .",
    "these singular regions are generally not separated from each other in momentum ( or equivalently in feynman parameter space ) , they are overlapping .",
    "our aim is to disentangle these regions of overlapping ir divergences . to this end",
    "we use a method called sector decomposition .",
    "iterated application will lead to a set of integrals in which the infrared singular behaviour is not contained in complicated functions anymore , but in simple products of feynman parameters raised to some power , times remnants of the functions @xmath28 , @xmath27 , whose structure is such that they neither lead to a pole anymore , nor change the exponent of the respective poles . in more detail ,",
    "the procedure consists of four basic building blocks :      in the first part of the algorithm we split the integration domain into @xmath12 parts and eliminate the @xmath6distribution in such a way that the remaining integrations are from 0 to 1 . to this end",
    "we decompose the integration range as follows @xmath32 where the @xmath33-function is defined as @xmath34 the integral is now split into @xmath12 domains corresponding to @xmath12 integrals @xmath35 from which we extract a common factor : @xmath36 . in the integrals",
    "@xmath35 we integrate out @xmath37 by using the @xmath6distribution after having done the substitution @xmath38 because of homogeneity , @xmath37 factorizes completely in the functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 and thus , using @xmath41 , one obtains @xmath42 note that the singular behaviour leading to @xmath1poles still comes from the regions of small @xmath43 s .",
    "this feature would be lost if one integrated out the @xmath6distribution in a naive way , since this would produce poles at upper limits of the parameter integral as well .",
    "the generated sectors will be called _ primary _ sectors in the following .",
    "the functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 are polynomials in the parameters @xmath46 .",
    "the second part of the algorithm consists of the iterated application of sector decomposition and a remapping of parameter space to the unit cube in order to disentangle the overlapping singular regions of the integrands . starting with eq .",
    "( [ eq : primary_sectors ] ) one repeats the following steps until complete separation of overlapping regions is achieved .",
    "ii.1 : : :    determine a minimal set of parameters , say    @xmath47 , such that    @xmath44 , respectively @xmath45 ,    vanish if the parameters of @xmath48 are set to zero .",
    "@xmath48 is generally not unique .",
    "additional selection    criteria can be introduced to choose an @xmath48 which    does not lead to a large number of subsequent sector decompositions .",
    "ii.2 : : :    decompose the corresponding @xmath49-cube into @xmath49    _",
    "subsectors_. @xmath50 ii.3 : : :    remap the variables to the unit cube in each new subsector by    substituting @xmath51    this gives a jacobian factor of @xmath52 . by    construction @xmath53",
    "factorizes at least from one    of the functions @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting subsector integrals have the general form    @xmath54    for each subsector the above steps have to be repeated as long as a set @xmath48 can be found such that one of the functions @xmath55 , @xmath56 vanishes if the elements of @xmath48 are set to zero . in each subsector",
    "new subsectors are created , resulting in a tree - like structure after a certain number of iterations .",
    "the book - keeping can be done with respective multi - indices .",
    "the iteration stops if the functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 contain a constant term , i.e. if they are of the following schematic form @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are polynomials in the variables @xmath46 ( without a constant term ) , and @xmath62 are kinematic invariants , defined through ( [ def : f ] ) .",
    "thus , after a certain number of iterations , each integral @xmath35 is split into a certain number , say @xmath63 , of subsector integrals . for simplicity",
    "we replace the multi - index @xmath64 stemming from the subsector decomposition by a single index which just counts the number of generated subsectors .",
    "now , the produced subsector integrals are exactly of the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : subsec_form ] ) , with the difference that the index @xmath65 now runs from 1 to @xmath63 , the total number of produced subsectors .",
    "evidently the singular behaviour of the integrand now can be trivially read off the exponents @xmath66 , @xmath67 for a given subsector integral ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 are integers ) .",
    "the singular behaviour is manifestly non - overlapping now and thus it is straightforward to define subtractions . before doing so a few comments are in order .",
    "the described method can not always lead to an optimal sector decomposition in the sense that the integral one starts with is split into the _ minimal _ number of subsector integrals , since obviously even finite integrals would be decomposed if a set @xmath48 exists such that @xmath27 or @xmath28 vanish .",
    "the virtue of the algorithm lies in its easy programmability , as we introduced standardized representations suitable for iteration .    for massless 2-loop 4-point functions with 7 propagators and all external legs on - shell",
    "the number of generated subsectors is a few hundred . for 3-loop 3-point functions with two legs on - shell and 9 propagators",
    "it is a few thousand .",
    "hence the bookkeeping of such numbers is only possible on a computer .",
    "the third part of the algorithm consists in a pole subtraction procedure for the subsector integrals @xmath68 .",
    "as the infrared sensitive variables now factorize in the subsector integrals , one can separate the part of the integrand which leads to @xmath1poles .",
    "explicitly , the following procedure has to be worked through for each variable @xmath69 and each subsector integrand :    * the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eq : subsec_form ] ) , characterized by the respective exponents @xmath70 @xmath71 of @xmath46 and the functions of the form ( [ eq : subsec_uf ] ) , can for each @xmath46 be written as @xmath72 if @xmath73 , the integration does not lead to an @xmath1pole . in this case",
    "no subtraction is needed and one can go to the next variable @xmath74 . if @xmath75 , one expands @xmath76 into a taylor series around @xmath77 . using the definition @xmath78 , one obtains @xmath79 * now the pole part can be extracted easily , and one obtains @xmath80 by construction the integral containing the remainder term @xmath81 does not get poles in @xmath1 from the @xmath46-integration anymore .",
    "for example , in the generic case of a logarithmic divergence , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "since , as long as @xmath85 , the expression ( [ tjsubtr ] ) still contains an overall factor @xmath86 , it is of the same form as ( [ eqsub_step1 ] ) for @xmath87 and the same steps as above can be applied to it .",
    "after @xmath88 steps all singular integrations are done analytically and all poles are extracted .",
    "the resulting expression can be expanded in @xmath1 now .",
    "this defines a laurent series in @xmath1 with coefficients @xmath89 for each subsector integral @xmath68 .",
    "since each loop can contribute at most one soft and collinear @xmath90 term , the highest possible infrared pole of an @xmath91loop graph @xmath19 is @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 following the steps outlined above one has generated a regular integral representation of the coefficients @xmath89 , consisting of @xmath94dimensional finite integrals over parameters @xmath43 .",
    "symmetries of the graph typically lead to equalities between primary sectors .",
    "it is thus useful to calculate the primary sectors @xmath35 @xmath95 separately before summing over the @xmath96 subsectors . in this way",
    "the symmetry relations provide a nontrivial check of the calculation .",
    "part four of the algorithm consists in the computation of the finite subsector integrals .",
    "the integrals contributing to the leading pole give ratios of polynomials in the mandelstam variables .",
    "for the coefficient of the subleading pole one generally gets logarithmic terms . in principle , one can attempt to perform the @xmath94-dimensional integrations of all functions contributing to the coefficient of the @xmath7 pole analytically . however , the sector decomposition produces many surface terms which will cancel only after summing up all subsector integrals , such that the analytical integrations become more and more involved for smaller values of @xmath9 , especially if the graphs contain more than one scale , as for example in the case of 2loop 4point functions . for these functions only the coefficients of the leading and subleading poles could be obtained analytically by automatizing the integrations using mathematica  @xcite . pushing the analytical integrations further is possible only if some of the more complicated functions are manipulated `` by hand '' before feeding them into the subroutine , but this is tedious in view of the large number of functions to integrate .",
    "more powerful analytical integration routines , specialized to manipulations of polylogarithms and nielsen functions @xcite would be needed to allow for a complete analytical treatment .",
    "on the other hand , the parametric integral representations are all very well suited for numerical integration , as long as the parametric function @xmath28 has a definite sign .",
    "then , it contains at most integrable , logarithmic divergences at the border of the integration domain .",
    "these generally present no problems for the numerical integrators which are on the market . if @xmath28 is not of a definite sign , which means that one has to integrate over thresholds , the integrands contain poles inside the multi - dimensional integration domain .",
    "the presence of these poles typically considerably slows down , if not hinders at all , the numerical evaluation of the integral .",
    "more advanced integration algorithms like e.g. the one proposed in @xcite may solve this problem .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of definite sign here .    in most algebraic programs it is directly possible to create fortran functions from a given expression .",
    "we fully automatized the translation of the expressions for the subsector integrals into the fortran codes . for every primary sector we calculated the integral of the sum of the subsector integrands ( [ eq : eps_series_gl ] ) with the monte carlo program bases @xcite .",
    "the integrations of all examples we calculated were totally stable .",
    "the limitation for the numerical integration comes thus only from cpu time , which increases with the number of loops and legs or , correspondingly , with the number of subsector functions . we will give more detailed information on program parameters in the examples below .",
    "in this section we apply our method to calculate several nontrivial feynman diagrams . to this end",
    "we implemented the algorithm outlined in section 2 into algebraic manipulation programs . to crosscheck the output we created two independent codes , one written in maple  @xcite , the other one in mathematica  @xcite .",
    "first we show a comparison of the results obtained by our method with the results from the analytical calculation of the planar  @xcite and non - planar  @xcite massless double box .",
    "then we give results for some 2loop 4point functions for which analytical results are not yet available in the literature , relevant for the calculation of certain higher order qcd corrections ( see section [ discuss ] ) .",
    "these are the massless planar and non - planar double box with one external leg off  shell , given in figs .",
    "as discussed above , our method so far only allows us to calculate numerical values of these graphs if all the mandelstam variables have the same sign . in any case",
    "our result may serve as a nontrivial check of a future analytical computation of these graphs .",
    "further we will give results for 3loop 3point graphs with two on - shell legs .",
    "the numerical values given in subsection [ dbonsh ] contain a relative error of one percent .",
    "note that for comparison purposes _ our _ conventions for the prefactors ( @xmath30-functions ) should be used since multiplying our results with conversion factors that are a power series in @xmath1 may lead to a bad error propagation . in subsections 3.2 and 3.3",
    "we use a different prefactor that in subsection [ dbonsh ] because it leads to more compact expressions for the analytical result .",
    "this conversion may lead to errors in the numerical result which are slightly larger than one percent due to the error propagation mentioned above .",
    "the numerical calculations were done on a dec  alpha workstation running with an ev6 processor .",
    "the cpu time needed ranges from about 5 hours for the planar two  loop graph up to about 3 days for the 3loop graph with 9 propagators .",
    "the computer time needed is always dominated by the finite @xmath97 terms .      in this subsection",
    "we compare our numerical approach with the analytical results for massless two - loop box diagrams calculated only recently  @xcite .",
    "these results have also been crosschecked analytically meanwhile , and the perfect agreement with our results within the error of numerical integration confirms the reliability of our method .      the graph ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : db_1mass ] with leg four on - shell ) depends on the two kinematical invariants @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "we want to discuss now the phenomenological applicability of our method to standard qcd processes .",
    "we will focus on reactions with massless particles in the loop .",
    "the first step of a multi - loop calculation is to express the corresponding amplitudes , preferably decomposed in colour and helicity space , in terms of basic tensor and scalar integrals . in the analytical approach",
    "one tries to express all tensor integrals by a certain set of scalar integrals , so - called master integrals . in a numerical approach",
    "it may be more convenient to calculate certain tensor integrals directly . in a feynman parameter language",
    "this amounts to the calculation of integrals of the type ( [ eq : param_rep ] ) , where one has in addition a polynomial @xmath164 of feynman parameters in the numerator .",
    "the generalization of our method to include these nontrivial numerators is straightforward .",
    "one way to proceed is to carry along the corresponding polynomial @xmath164 through all the steps in addition to @xmath28 and @xmath27 , iterating the decomposition until @xmath165 contains also a constant term .",

    "this is also true for 3loop 3point functions needed for a @xmath169 calculation of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and the drell  yan process .",
    "although our algorithm produces integrable functions which in principle always allow for a numerical evaluation , the presence of thresholds inside the integration region worsens the convergence properties of an integration routine .",
    "these cases are marked with an asterisk @xmath167 in table 1 .",
    "it means that more efficient numerical integrators than the ones we used would be needed .    after having calculated the purely virtual corrections of",
    "say a @xmath170 process involving @xmath11loop integrals , the latter have to be combined with the @xmath171 corrections which include @xmath172loop integrals and where one has to integrate over the extra ( unobserved ) particle .",
    "this integration produces soft / collinear @xmath1poles which require the knowlegde of the respective @xmath172loop integrals to @xmath173 , at least in the corresponding ir regions , since they have to be combined with these singular phase space integrals .",
    "however , most of the existing analytical results are known only to @xmath97 . in the context of our method ,",
    "expansion of the results for the virtual integrals up to higher orders in @xmath1 constitutes no principle problem , only the size of the fortran routines will increase .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented a simple , constructive subtraction algorithm to deal with ir divergent multi - loop integrals .",
    "although the iterated sector decomposition produces in general a relatively large number of subsector integrals , we demonstrated that by means of automatization our method allows for the numerical computation of highly nontrivial feynman diagrams of two and three  loop type .",
