    "the maxwell - bloch equations aptly describe the pulse and averaged atomic population dynamics , which have been extensively investigated for multi - level systems @xcite . localized and nonlinear cnoidal wave solutions have been identified , as exact solutions @xcite , which has found experimental verification @xcite .",
    "the subject of pulse propagation in nonlinear fibers has also been well - studied , since its prediction by hasegawa in 1974 @xcite . the non - linear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , where the cubic nonlinearity arises due to kerr effect",
    ", describes the pulse dynamics .",
    "this integrable system in one dimension possesses soliton solutions @xcite , which can be dark @xcite , bright @xcite or grey @xcite , depending on the nature of nonlinearity and dispersion .",
    "some of these solitons were experimentally observed , long after their prediction @xcite .",
    "gross - pitaevskii equation in one - dimension , which captures the mean - field dynamics of bose einstein condensates ( bec ) , being identical to nlse , has also naturally evoked strong interest in solitons and their dynamics in cigar - shaped bec @xcite .",
    "dark solitons in the repulsive regime and bright soliton and soliton trains in the attractive sector have been experimentally produced @xcite .",
    "recently , the grey soliton , having complex profile has been produced through soliton collision in bec @xcite .",
    "grey solitons have been the subject of some recent studies @xcite .",
    "these are analogs of complex envelope bloch solitons in condensed matter systems , which can connect differently ordered domains , without passing through the normal phase .",
    "this naturally makes it energetically favorable , as compared to the nel soliton , wherein the soliton profile , being of the hyperbolic tangent type , passes through the normal phase , at the vanishing point of the above profile .",
    "it is interesting to note that the speed of the soliton can vary from zero to a maximum , depending on the depth of the grey soliton .",
    "furthermore , the energy shows a maximum value as a function of momentum .",
    "the doping of nonlinear fibers with suitable multilevel systems has opened up the exciting possibility of naturally combining the the atomic system with nlse , which can possibly lead to effective soliton control and manipulation .",
    "recently , the localized solitons of a nonlinear fiber with a three level dopant has been investigated , wherein exact solitons of @xmath0 type have been identified @xcite .",
    "the constraints of this coupled nonlinear system has led to strong restrictions on the pulse dynamics .",
    "it was found that , the frequencies have to be perfectly matched for these solutions to exist @xcite . in this paper , we present exact grey soliton profiles in this system , which removes the above restriction on the pulse propagation . the complex profile s phase degree of freedom plays a crucial role in relaxing the constraint of frequency matching .",

    "it is explicitly shown how the phase degree of freedom removes the restrictive equal frequency conditions on the @xmath0 paired pulses @xcite .",
    "the cross - phase modulation is found to play a crucial role , in controlling the speed of the grey soliton . for the two level system , it is observed that grey soliton is strictly forbidden and only the sit soliton can propagate in this dynamical system .",
    "subsequently , we present the numerical techniques and the results of numerical propagation of our solution , which clearly shows stability of the obtained solutions in a wide parameter range .",

    "the frequency shift was assumed identical for the two possible fiber modes .",
    "the modes of the fiber are near resonant with the transitions of the atomic system .",
    "the two modes of the optical fiber may be described by the profile ,    @xmath7    @xmath8 being the slowly varying envelope , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the carrier frequency and wave number respectively of the @xmath11 mode .",
    "the time variation of the population of atomic levels are governed by optical bloch equations .",

    "we take into account the effects of kerr nonlinearity ( proportional to the square of the electric field ) and dispersion , in order to truly describe the spatio - temporal variation of the light pulses through the fiber . using the approximation of slowly varying envelope",
    "one can cast the nonlinear schrdinger equation , in rabi frequencies , as @xmath17 where the terms with @xmath18 are due to group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) , those with @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the effect of kerr nonlinearity , and the coupling of the @xmath11 mode with the atomic system , respectively .",
    "a dark - bright coupled soliton pair was reported in @xcite in this system .",

    "the following constraint can be obtained from equations ( [ conu1 ] ) and ( [ conu2 ] ) @xmath32 equations ( [ consistent equation_a ] ) , ( [ con1 ] ) and ( [ con2 ] ) lead to ( [ constraint2 ] ) , which is an important result that needs to be satisfied by the nonlinearity and dispersion in the medium at the two mode frequencies :    @xmath33    another important point to note is that , for @xmath34 , in order to have a solution , @xmath35 is required .",
    "this is because of the consistency relation ( [ consistent equation_b ] ) viz . , @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath37 , then @xmath38 and the arguments of all the sech and tanh functions in the ansatz ( [ field_amplitude1]-[atom_amplitude3 ] ) blow up to give constant solutions . therefore @xmath39 is required when @xmath34 .",

    "we fix @xmath40 to any value and find the rest of the parameters in terms of @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , @xmath37 ) . therefore our ansatz ( [ field_amplitude1]-[atom_amplitude3 ] ) represents valid solutions for all @xmath41 , given the consistency conditions are satisfied , showing that grey solitons of varying depths can be solutions of the system .",
    "the velocity of the solitons ( u ) has a nontrivial dependence on @xmath41 .",
    "this physically means that the velocity of the solitons is dictated by the depth of the grey soliton in the system .",
    "fig ( [ fig4 ] ) shows that the solitons are velocity restricted with maximum value attained at @xmath43 .",

    "coupled differential equations in 10 variables with complicated potentials ( composed from the solutions themselves ) , which are difficult to handle either analytically or numerically .",
    "hence , we have carried out numerical evolution of the pulse for the purpose of stability check . here",
    ", we state the equations of motion of the perturbations , as derived from the equations of motion for @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( 2 - 6 ) by substituting @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . the quantities @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "are given by the rhs of equations ( [ field_amplitude1]-[atom_amplitude3 ] ) respectively , without the exponential terms .",

    "the initial shapes of the input pulse and the initial atomic populations can be obtained in the limit of @xmath88 and @xmath89 from the analytical expressions ( [ field_amplitude1]-[field_amplitude2 ] ) and ( [ atom_amplitude1]-[atom_amplitude3 ] ) respectively .",
    "we use grey and bright solitons with width @xmath90 psec in the present investigation .",
    "parameters used in the numerical simulation obey self consistent relations ( [ constraint1 ] ) and ( [ constraint2 ] ) .",
    "we first explore the stable propagation of the grey and bright solitons in presence of gvd with same character .",
    "figure ( [ fig5 ] ) shows that the amplitudes of the output pulses are retaining their initial shape .",

    "the numerical results obtained from the runge - kutta and split step operator methods match well with those obtained analytically .",
    "next we study how the blackness parameter @xmath41 leads to stable propagation of soliton through the medium even though gvd has same sign",
    ". a comparative study of the dark and grey solitons through the medium is shown in the figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "the dark soliton can be obtained with @xmath92 whereas @xmath93 represents the grey soliton . for dark soliton",
    ", the intensity of the dip always vanishes but the same for the grey soliton always remains .",
    "the variation of phase with time with propagation length for both dark and grey solitons is seen to be antisymmetric in nature .",
    "interestingly , dark soliton shows a sudden change in phase across the line center while grey soliton displays no change in shape of phase across the line center during the length of propagation . in the course of propagation , the antisymmetric phase has a temporal shift due to the presence of self and cross phase modulations of the medium in both the cases .",
    "the dark soliton develops instability , both in intensity as well as in the phase while grey soliton propagates through the medium without loss of generality upto sufficient length of propagation .",
    "hence the instability due to the same gvd sign can be compensated with the proper choice of the blackness parameter @xmath41 .",
    "figures ( [ fig7]a)-([fig7]b ) show the results for the spatio - temporal evolution of grey and bright solitons in presence of the opposite group velocity dispersion .",
    "both the grey and bright solitons maintain their initial shape .",
    "in conclusion , grey solitons , analog of bloch solitons in condensed matter systems , have been identified as exact solutions of the coupled nonlinear schrdinger and bloch equations .",
    "the complex nature of the profile played a crucial role in removing the restrictive frequency matching condition of @xmath0 paired solutions @xcite .",
    "we numerically evolved our solution and found it to be stable in both regimes of group velocity dispersion .",
    "we note that , for the case of coupling with a two - level system ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) instead of the @xmath1 system considered here , the pure @xmath26p and grey solitonic profiles are prohibited for g , while a pure sech profile is allowed .",
    "the fact that our solutions are stable for some parameters in both regimes of group velocity dispersion signs , is very interesting and needs further investigation .",
