    "first generation squark production proceeds through @xmath0 that is dominated by @xmath1-channel exchange of a gluino that acquires a majorana mass ( `` majorana gluino '' ) using valence quarks from the proton . not surprisingly , the largest contributions come from sub - processes involving a chirality flip in the @xmath1-channel gluino exchange diagram which is a comparatively unsuppressed dimension-5 interaction .",
    "the bounds on first generation squarks , typically combined with the second generation in a simplified model involving @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are currently @xmath4  tev for @xmath5 @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "one of us ( gdk ) with adam martin showed that the presence of a gluino that acquires a dirac mass ( referred to as a `` dirac gluino '' )  instead of a majorana mass  significantly weakens these collider constraints .",
    "this was due to three reasons : first , a dirac gluino can be significantly heavier than a majorana gluino , with respect to fine - tuning of the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale .",
    "this is because a dirac gluino yields one - loop _ finite _ contributions to squark masses @xcite .",
    "second , no `` chirality - flipping '' dirac gluino @xmath1-channel exchange diagrams exist , and thus several subprocesses for squark production simply vanish .",
    "third , the remaining squark production subprocess amplitudes are suppressed by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the typical momentum exchanged through the dirac gluino . for a heavier dirac gluino ( @xmath8-@xmath9  tev )",

    "dirac gaugino masses have been considered long ago @xcite and have inspired more recent model building @xcite and phenomenology @xcite .",
    "as beautiful as dirac gauginos may be , there are two objections that are sometimes raised :    * supersymmetry - breaking sectors do not generically have @xmath10-terms much smaller than @xmath11-terms . in the absence of a specialized mediation sector that sequesters the @xmath10-term contributions",
    "@xcite , we might expect both dirac and majorana masses to be generated ( for example , @xcite ) .",

    "while there are mechanisms to generate a quartic in models with a pure dirac gaugino mass ( see @xcite in the context of @xmath12-symmetric supersymmetry ) , it is obviously of interest to understand the impact of electroweak gauginos acquiring majorana masses on squark production cross section limits .    in this context",
    ", we consider two generalizations of ref .",
    "@xcite : ( i ) models with a `` mixed gluino '' that acquires both dirac and majorana masses , and ( ii ) models in which the electroweak gauginos acquire purely majorana masses , and contribute to squark production .",
    "as we will see , both cases have surprising outcomes .",
    "our primary interest is to compare squark production cross sections with mixed gauginos against the pure dirac and pure majorana cases .",
    "mixed gauginos were also considered in @xcite , where the main emphasis was on distinguishing the different types of gaugino masses well before the strong bounds on colored superpartner production were set by the lhc collaborations .",
    "our interest in this paper is largely orthogonal , examining in detail the modifications to squark production when the gaugino is _",
    "we used madgraph5 @xcite to simulate squark production at leading order ( lo ) for the lhc operating at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath13  tev and @xmath14  tev using the cteq6l1 parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "we did not , however , incorporate next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections in our cross sections , for several reasons : first , in some cases there is a large range of scales between the squark mass and the gaugino mass , and unfortunately existing codes ( prospino  2.1 @xcite and @xcite ) are not designed to handle this .",
    "second , to the best of our knowledge , the nlo corrections for a dirac gaugino as well as a mixed gaugino have not been computed .",
    "this is an important outstanding problem , but it is not the primary interest of this paper . in much of the results presented below , we consider _ ratios _ of production cross sections , where most of the large nlo corrections are expected to cancel .",
    "we do show some lo cross sections as a function of gaugino mass , to better explain our results , however , in these cases we are generally interested in the trend as a function of the gaugino mass rather than the precise cross section values",
    ". the full nlo calculation would be interesting to compute , but it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "`` mixed gauginos '' are , by definition , the majorana mass eigenstates of gauginos that acquire both a dirac mass with an adjoint fermion partner as well as majorana masses for the gluino , the adjoint fermion , or both .",

    ", we neglect flavor mixing among the squarks , since the existence of sizable majorana masses means we do not have @xmath12-symmetry to protect us against flavor - changing neutral currents @xcite .    renormalization group evolution from the messenger scale to the weak scale affects the relative size of the dirac and majorana masses .",
    "let us first define the dirac mass , the majorana gaugino mass , and the majorana adjoint mass as @xmath24 all of these quantities are generated at the messenger scale ( possibly with additional hidden sector renormalization @xcite ) . for a gauge group @xmath25 with beta function coefficient @xmath26 and quadratic casimir of the adjoint @xmath27 , the dirac operator receives significant rg effects ( neglecting yukawa couplings )",

    "constant , we see that the squark production cross section _ decreases _ as a majorana mass @xmath57 is introduced .",
    "this we explore in detail below .",
    "next , we see distinctly different rates of variation in the cross sections across the three plots . at @xmath72  gev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mbyd1200 ] ) the cross section falls by an order of magnitude as @xmath42 goes from @xmath89 to @xmath90  tev , after which it is roughly constant , whereas for squark masses @xmath61  gev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mbyd400 ] ) and @xmath87  gev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mbyd800 ] ) we find much less variation : the cross section drops by a factor of a few as @xmath42 is increased from @xmath89 to @xmath30  tev , and then asymptotes to a fixed value .",
    "the larger variation is present because , as we saw earlier , for larger squark masses , the @xmath91-channel squark  anti - squark cross section becomes more competitive with the @xmath1-channel gluino exchange induced squark - squark production processes .",
    "it is this competition between the two leading modes for gluino masses below @xmath92  tev that results in the larger rate of variation of the cross section in that region in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbyd1200 ] .",
    "the domination of squark - antisquark production for gluino masses above @xmath90  tev results in the constancy of the cross section observed in the right end of the plot .",
    "we now turn our attention to the plots on the left , depicting contours of the ratios of the corresponding cross sections on the right to those of a pure majorana gluino with a mass the same as @xmath42 .",
    "to understand the features of these plots , we will have to consider the competition between three different modes : squark  anti - squark production , _ same - handed _",
    "squark pair production and _ opposite - handed _",
    "squark pair production .",
    "two distinctive features seen here are ( i ) at a low squark mass of @xmath61  gev , the ratio increases as we move horizontally to the right , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbyd400ratiocontour ] , ( ii ) at higher squark masses of @xmath87 and @xmath88  gev , the ratio first decreases and then increases as we move in the horizontal direction , with the local minimum shifting to the right as @xmath2 is increased , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mbyd800ratiocontour ] and [ fig : mbyd1200ratiocontour ] .",
    "the first feature is a result of the same mechanism that results in the lack of variation in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbyd400 ] .",
    "the squark  anti - squark production dominates over squark - squark production for a large range of gluino masses at @xmath93  gev , and as @xmath42 is increased , this domination increases for both a majorana and a mixed gluino ( with the domination in the majorana case weaker ) as we saw earlier in fig .",
    "[ fig : dirglu400 ] .",
    "hence we observe a uniform increase in the ratio , seen to approach unity .",
    "the second feature can be understood in terms of figs .",
    "[ fig : dirglu800 ] and [ fig : dirglu1200 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dirglu800 ] , for instance , we notice that near the left extreme ( @xmath94  tev ) , the majorana cross section is dominated by squark pair production and the dirac cross section gets nearly equal contributions from both squark  anti - squark and squark pair production . near the right extreme ( @xmath95  tev ) , the dominant mode of majorana cross section has fallen and the total cross section has near - equal contributions from both modes , while the dirac cross section , dominated strongly by squark  anti - squark production , is now comparable to either mode of the majorana case . at either extreme , the total dirac cross section is able to catch up to an extent with the total majorana cross section , for different reasons . in the intermediary mass range ,",
    "however , the dirac cross section , dominated by only squark  anti - squark production , is much smaller than the majorana case .",
    "this argument can be extended to mixed gluinos as well , and hence the local minimum observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbyd800ratiocontour ] .",
    "the above discussion applies also to fig .",
    "[ fig : mbyd1200ratiocontour ] , except that , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dirglu1200 ] , the dirac cross section catches up with the majorana at even higher gluino masses .",
    "this results in the rightward shift compared to the @xmath71  gev case in the local minimum .    if we now move vertically anywhere in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbyd1200 ] , or for gluino masses below @xmath30  tev in figs .",
    "[ fig : mbyd400 ] and [ fig : mbyd800 ] , we observe a drop in cross section .",

    "this may seem counter to what we would expect when increasing the majorana content of the model .",

    "[ fig : ululstar ] we see a nearly unvarying cross section as we increase @xmath85 as shown by the the blue line . since the sub - dominant @xmath1-channel gluino diagram is negligible , we find that the cross section values nearly coincides with the pure majorana case .",

    "[ sec : totalsigmaqcd ] , on why the total cross section of squark production declines despite an addition of majorana content .",
    "we find that an increase in cross section of the pairs @xmath115  as expected when departing from a pure dirac scenario  is less relevant in comparison to the decrease in cross section of the pairs @xmath116  due to various kinds of kinematic suppression as discussed in this section .",
    "the analysis above shows that in addition to the suppression from the operator dimension ( relative dominance of dim-5 or dim-6 ) and the kinematics , the third factor that is essential to determine the cross section trends is the pdfs .",
    "thus the trends for individual modes would be identical for down squarks except for the effects of pdf suppression .",
    "as for the second generation of squarks , the far smaller pdfs of the corresponding second generation quarks in the proton render most modes negligible , with the only sizeable contribution coming from @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which proceed through an @xmath91-channel gluon .",
    "therefore we see that the principal difference between the first and second generations is that @xmath1-channel gluino mediation exhibits non - trivial behavior in the former , while it is practically absent in the latter .",
    "in this scenario , the two gluino mass eigenstates have masses @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and the mixing between the states is maximal ( @xmath122 ) independent of @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath56 .",
    "we consider the modification resulting from the majorana content of gluino in the same way as the previous section , with the corresponding results shown in fig .",

    "the impact of the electroweakinos on the total cross section is by affecting @xmath1-channel ( mainly left - handed ) squark - pair production , and such an impact would weaken as @xmath287 is increased .",
