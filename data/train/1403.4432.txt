    "in recent years , the problem of anisotropic quantum scattering in two spatial dimensions ( 2d ) attracts increasing interest .",
    "it is stimulated by the spectacular proposals for prospects to create exotic and highly correlated quantum systems with dipolar gases @xcite .",
    "particularly , there were considered anisotropic superfluidity @xcite , 2d dipolar fermions @xcite , and few - body dipolar complexes @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental production of ultracold polar molecules in the confined geometry of optical traps @xcite has opened up ways to realize these phenomena .",
    "noteworthy also is a rather long history of research of 2d quantum effects in condensed matter physics .",
    "one can note superfluid films @xcite , high - temperature superconductivity @xcite , 2d materials , such as graphene @xcite , and even possibilities for topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "unique opportunities for modeling these 2d effects in a highly controlled environment have recently appeared with the development of experimental techniques for creating quasi-2d bose and fermi ultracold gases @xcite .",
    "interest in the processes and effects in 2d - geometry has stimulated the theory of elementary quantum two - body systems and processes in the plane .",
    "special consideration should be given to the anisotropy and long - range character of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "actually , usual partial - wave analysis becomes inefficient for describing the dipole - dipole scattering due to the strong anisotropic coupling of different partial - waves in the asymptotic region @xcite .",
    "recently , considerable progress in the analysis of the 2d and quasi-2d ( q2d ) scattering of dipoles has been achieved  @xcite .",
    "thus , the 2d dipolar scattering in the threshold and semiclassical regimes was studied in the case of the dipole polarization directed orthogonally to the scattering plane  @xcite .",
    "an arbitrary angle of polarization was considered in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a method for quantitative analysis of the 2d quantum scattering on a long - range strongly anisotropic scatterer .",
    "particularly , it permits the description of the 2d collisions of unpolarized dipoles .",
    "our approach is based on the method suggested in @xcite for the few - dimensional scattering which was successfully applied to the dipole - dipole scattering induced by an elliptically polarized laser field in the 3d free - space @xcite .",
    "the key elements of the method are described in section ii . in section iii , we apply the method to the 2d scattering on the cylindrical potential with the elliptical base and the 2d dipole - dipole scattering of unpolarized dipoles .",
    "we reproduce the threshold formula @xcite for the scattering amplitude on the cylinder potential with the circular base and the results of @xcite for the 2d scattering of polarized dipoles .",
    "high efficiency of the method has been found in all problems being considered .",
    "the last section contains the concluding remarks .",
    "some important details of the computational scheme and illustration of the convergence are given in appendices .",
    "the quantum scattering on the anisotropic potential @xmath0 in the plane is described by the 2d schrdinger equation in polar coordinates @xmath1 @xmath2 with the scattering boundary conditions @xmath3 in the asymptotic region @xmath4 and the hamiltonian of the system @xmath5 the unknown wave function @xmath6 and the scattering amplitude @xmath7 are searched for the fixed momentum @xmath8 defined by the colliding energy @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and the direction @xmath11 of the incident wave ( defined by the angle @xmath12 and for the scattering angle @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the reduced mass of the system . in the polar",
    "coordinates , the angular part of the kinetic energy operator in @xmath15 has a simple form @xmath16 .",
    "the interaction potential @xmath17 can be anisotropic in the general case , i.e. to be strongly dependent on @xmath13 .",
    "it is clear that varying the direction of the incident wave @xmath11 can be replaced by the rotation @xmath18 of the interaction potential by the angle @xmath19 for the fixed direction of the incident wave , which we choose to be coincident with the x - axis .",
    "thus , in the case of anisotropic potential @xmath17 the task is to solve the problem ( [ eq1 ] ) with the interaction potential @xmath20 for all possible @xmath19 and fixed @xmath9 with the scattering boundary conditions @xmath21 if the scattering amplitude @xmath7 is found , one can calculate the differential scattering cross section @xmath22 where @xmath23 , as well as the total cross section @xmath24 by averaging over all possible orientations @xmath19 of the scatterer and integration over the scattering angle @xmath13 .    to integrate the problem ( [ eq1]),([eq2 ] ) , we use",
    "the method suggested in @xcite to solving a few - dimensional scattering problem and applied in @xcite for the dipole - dipole scattering in the 3d free - space . following the ideas of these works we choose the eigenfunctions @xmath25 of the operator @xmath26 as a fourier basis for the angular - grid representation of the searched wave - function @xmath27 .",
    "we introduce the uniform grid @xmath28 ) over the @xmath13 and @xmath19-variables and search the wave function as expansion @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the inverse matrix to the @xmath31 square matrix @xmath32 defined on the angular grid , we use the completeness relation for the fourier basis @xmath33 , which in our grid representation reads @xmath34 . ] .    in the representation ( [ eq7 ] ) the unknown coefficients",
    "@xmath35 are defined by the values of the searched wave function on the angular grid @xmath36 , any local interaction is diagonal    @xmath37    and the angular part @xmath38 of the kinetic energy operator has a simple form @xmath39 note that the presence in the interaction potential of the `` nonlocal '' angular part ( i.e. the integration or differentiation over angular variable ) leads to destroying the diagonal structure in ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "thus , the 2d schrdinger equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is reduced in the angular - grid representation ( [ eq7 ] ) to the system of coupled ordinary differential equations of the second order : @xmath40 since the wave function @xmath41 must be finite at the origin @xmath42 , the `` left - side '' boundary condition for the functions @xmath35 reads as @xmath43 in the asymptotic region @xmath4 the scattering boundary condition ( [ eq3 ] ) accepts the form @xmath44    by using the fourier expansion for the plane wave @xmath45 and the scattering amplitude @xmath46 are the first kind bessel functions of integer order .",

    "the acquired `` left - side '' boundary condition reads @xmath63    thus , the scattering problem is reduced to the boundary value problem ( [ my_eq15]-[my_eq17 ] ) @xmath64 which can be efficiently solved with standard computational techniques such as the sweeping method @xcite or the lu - decomposition @xcite .",
    "the detailed structure of the matrix of the coefficients @xmath65 is discussed in appendix a. after the solving of eq.([my_eq19 ] ) and finding the wave function @xmath66 the scattering amplitude @xmath67 is constructed according to eqs.([eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
