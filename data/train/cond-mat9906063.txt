    "one is often interested in long length scale and long time scale phenomena in solids ( eg .",
    "late stage kinetics of solid state phase transformations@xcite ; motion of domain walls interfaces@xcite ; fracture@xcite ; friction@xcite etc . ) .",
    "such phenomena are usually described by continuum theories .",
    "microscopic simulations@xcite of finite systems , on the other hand , like molecular dynamics , lattice boltzmann or monte carlo , deal with microscopic variables like the positions and velocities of constituent particles and together with detailed knowledge of interatomic potentials , hope to build up a description of the macro system from a knowledge of these micro variables .",
    "how does one recover continuum physics from simulating the dynamics of @xmath5 particles ?",
    "this requires a `` coarse - graining '' procedure in space ( for equilibrium ) or both space and time for non - equilibrium continuum theories . over what",
    "coarse graining length and time scale does one recover results consistent with continuum theories ?",
    "in this paper , we attempt to answer these questions for the simplest nontrivial case , namely , a crystalline solid , ( without any point , line or surface defects@xcite ) in equilibrium , at a non zero temperature far away from phase transitions . we show that coarse graining of microscopic local strain fluctuations obtained from configurations generated in a computer simulation , enables us to calculate elastic susceptibilities ( compliances ) as a function of the coarse graining length .",
    "detailed finite size scaling analysis of this data yields finally elastic constants of the solid  the essential inputs to continuum elasticity theory@xcite .",
    "the strain field ( together with defect densities ) constitute the coarse grained description of a solid essential for understanding solid state phase transitions like structural transitions@xcite and melting@xcite .",
    "calculation of elastic constants from simulations fall into two categories , viz .",
    "they are obtained either from , thermal averages of fluctuations of the stress or the strain  the so called `` fluctuation '' methods@xcite , or from the stress - strain curve as computed from a series of simulations@xcite .",
    "fluctuation methods , though requiring longer runs for accumulating statistically significant data , are often preferred because the entire matrix of elastic constants can be evaluated in a single run , whereas in the latter method for every elastic constant an appropriate strain ( or stress ) have to be applied .",
    "also mapping out the stress - strain curve can be treacherous especially for soft systems where the possibility of setting up a plastic flow in the system is high@xcite .",
    "though for most systems careful applications of either procedure should yield results of comparable accuracy , they suffer from some common limitations .",
    "firstly , elastic constants are obtained for a particular system size @xmath2 . in order to take the infinite size ( thermodynamic )",
    "limit one needs to simulate a sequence of systems with increasing values of @xmath2  often a computationally expensive proposition since equilibration of large systems take increasingly larger times .",
    "secondly , these procedures are not general and fail for model systems of particles interacting via singular potentials eg .",
    ", the hard sphere@xcite or the hard disk@xcite system where the instantaneous force on a particle is not well defined . to obtain elastic constants of hard systems ,",
    "one therefore needs to develop special methods@xcite .",
    "for instance , the elastic constants of the hard sphere system was calculated by runge and chester@xcite by generalizing a technique used previously for calculating the hard sphere pressure@xcite . in this approach one",
    "tries to evaluate ensemble averages of quantities involving delta functions by calculating acceptance probabilities of virtual monte carlo steps .",
    "such methods are cumbersome to use and may require ill defined averages of quantities whose variance has weak divergences@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the method presented here has several advantages .",
    "firstly , elastic constants are obtained from a coarse graining procedure which automatically , gives the infinite system values .",
    "secondly , our procedure needs only the instantaneous particle configurations and makes no reference to the potential or forces .",
    "it is therefore quite generally applicable to _ any _ system for which these configurations or `` snapshots '' are known .",
    "lastly , it will soon be evident that this technique is easy to use requiring a computational effort not much more than a calculation of , say , the pair distribution function@xcite for a given particle configuration .    there are three essential elements or steps in the method ,    1 .   a procedure for calculating elastic strains from configurations",
    "the coarse graining procedure of averaging fluctuations of these strains over larger and larger sub  -blocks of length @xmath6 of a system of total size @xmath2 and calculating the values of these fluctuations in the thermodynamic limit 3 .   and , finally , converting the data for the strain fluctuations into elastic constants using well known results of continuum elasticity theory@xcite .",
    "we take up the second of these steps first as it is quite general and applicable to fluctuations of any intensive variable .",
    "indeed , variants of this method have been used extensively@xcite in the past for obtaining finite size scaled susceptibilities and goes by the name of `` block  - analysis '' . in the next section ( section ii )",
    "we describe this block  -analysis technique for obtaining the susceptibility of the two  -dimensional ising model@xcite for illustration . in section iii",
    "we define the microscopic strains @xmath7 and describe how we obtain them from our computer simulations .",
    "we then explain how to adopt the coarse graining scheme described in section ii for strains to finally obtain the elastic constants .",
    "this is followed by our results for the hard disk and the inverse twelveth power `` soft '' disk systems in two dimensions .",
    "we conclude this paper with a discussion of these results and enumerating future directions .",
    "the block analysis method has been used to obtain the compressibility of the ising lattice gas@xcite , the two  -dimensional lennard  -jones fluid@xcite and fluids with internal classical and quantum degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "below , we describe a version of this method which allows us to explicitly and systematically incorporate finite size effects arising both from a non  -zero correlation length as well as special constraints due to the nature of the ensemble used .",
    "this treatment is analogous to the one used in ref.@xcite for analyzing density fluctuations in the two  -dimensional lennard jones fluid .    to begin , consider a general system described by a scalar order parameter @xmath8 .",
    "we are interested in obtaining thermodynamic properties of this system in the disordered phase .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to use the following quadratic helmholtz free energy functional , @xmath9 $ ] . @xmath10",
    "the correlation function @xmath11 implied by the above free energy in the high temperature phase ( @xmath12 ) is given@xcite by the following ornstein  -zernicke form , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the correlation length ( @xmath15 ) , the ( infinite system ) susceptibility @xmath16 is , in turn , given by @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the angular brackets @xmath19\\,\\ , \\exp ( -\\beta f[\\{\\phi\\}])$ ] .",
    "consider further that we want to measure this susceptibility from a computer simulation of an ising model within a finite simulation box of size @xmath2 .",
    "in the course of the simulation we measure @xmath20 averaged within a sub - block of size @xmath6 , @xmath21 then the fluctuations of @xmath22 measured within this block is , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the inverse fourier transform of the correlation function defined in eq.([eq : gq ] ) and is given@xcite , quite generally , by , @xmath25 where , @xmath26}\\ ] ]    one expects therefore that as , @xmath27 the block susceptibility @xmath28 .",
    "the behaviour of the block susceptibilities , however , is strongly dependent on the ensemble@xcite in which the simulation is carried out .",
    "for example , using the lattice gas@xcite language , in a `` grand canonical '' ensemble where the chemical composition @xmath20 of the lattice gas is allowed to fluctuate keeping the chemical potential difference fixed ( @xmath29 in this case ) the block susceptibility does approach @xmath30 for large @xmath1 . in a canonical ensemble ,",
    "however , the average of @xmath20 over the entire system is constrained to vanish for all times .",
    "in such a case the behaviour of @xmath31 is more complicated but can , nevertheless , be explicitly determined as follows .    introducing the lagrange multiplier @xmath32 and defining the new correlator , @xmath33 \\phi(0 ) \\phi(r ) \\exp ( -\\beta f - \\kappa \\int d^dr \\,\\ , \\phi),\\ ] ] where the free energy @xmath34 is given by eq.([eq : landau ] ) )",
    ", one shows that that @xmath35 .",
    "the constant @xmath36 is given by , @xmath37 repeating the analysis with @xmath24 replaced by @xmath38 one obtains the desired finite size scaling form for @xmath31 in the canonical ensemble .",
    "we derive this form explicitly for the case of @xmath39 below .",
    "the correlation function @xmath40 is , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a bessel function and we have suppressed the subscripts in @xmath43 and @xmath44 for simplicity .",
    "we have therefore , @xmath45 with the function @xmath46 being defined as , @xmath47 as can be easily verified @xmath48 goes to @xmath49 within a range @xmath50 . using the above expressions we find finally , @xmath51.\\ ] ]",
    "this is the main result of this section .",
    "note that the form given above implies @xmath52 as @xmath53 .",
    "in general there will be higher order corrections to eq.([eq : main ] ) coming from higher order correlations signifying the breakdown of the quadratic form for the free energy eq.([eq : landau ] ) .",
    "these introduce terms of order @xmath54 implying extra parameters ( with the constraint @xmath55 being imposed to eliminate one of them ) . in fig .",
    "( 1 ) we have plotted @xmath56 against @xmath57 for various values of @xmath58 .",
    "one observes that for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and eq.([eq : main ] ) goes over to the following simple limiting form , @xmath61.\\ ] ] one can then extract @xmath62 from the slope of the linear region at small @xmath57 .",
    "this is equivalent to the procedure followed for example in ref.@xcite for extracting the compressibility of the lattice gas at the critical density .",
    "obviously , for @xmath63 , this construction becomes less well defined and the finding the `` linear '' region becomes subjective .",
    "fitting the full data to the form given in eq.([eq : main ] ) makes it possible to extract @xmath62 even when the system size is not much bigger than the correlation length .",
    "we illustrate this below using previously published data of rovere , nielaba and binder@xcite obtained from simulations of the lattice gas model using spin exchange dynamics ( canonical ensemble ) .    in fig .",
    "( 2 ) we plot @xmath64 as a function of @xmath65 .",
    "this choice of the axes is identical to the one used in the original work@xcite and is equivalent .",
    "the points are the data of ref.@xcite at various ( dimensionless ) temperatures @xmath66 .",
    "the curves through the data are fits to eq.([eq : main ] ) .",
    "the extracted compressibility @xmath67 are plotted in fig .",
    "( 3 ) and compared with the previous estimates@xcite based on linear extrapolation and the theoretical curve@xcite .",
    "though , for large @xmath68 where the correlation length @xmath44 remains small one gets identical results , @xmath67 extracted from the fits to the full curve continues to be closer to the theoretical ( exact ) estimate as @xmath69 ( and consequently @xmath70 ) .",
    "simultaneously , we also obtain from eq.([eq : main ] ) an estimate for the correlation length @xmath44 which is shown in fig .",
    "the agreement with theory@xcite is not as good .",
    "this is only to be expected since the correlation length is a more sensitive quantity than the susceptibility .",
    "also , the fitting procedure can not overcome errors built into the data because of critical slowing down near @xmath71 which is known to lead to a systematic underestimation due to the use of a biased estimator@xcite .",
    "further , close to @xmath71 the free energy functional ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : landau ] ) ) ceases to be valid , the correlation function @xmath72 and this affects our estimate for the correlation length .",
    "this is particularly important in two dimensions@xcite where , in the ising lattice gas , the exponent @xmath73 indicates a rather large deviation of the correlation function from the ornstein zernike behavior , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gq ] ) , while in @xmath74 , @xmath75 and hence eqs.([eq : cor2 ] ) and ( [ eq : cor3 ] ) should be more accurate .    far away from a critical point , on the other hand",
    ", none of these criticisms apply and accurate estimates for the susceptibility can be obtained even from relatively small systems even in @xmath39 using the ideas described here .",
    "imagine a system in the constant nvt ( canonical ) ensemble at a fixed density @xmath76 evolving in time @xmath77 .",
    "for any `` snapshot '' of this system taken from this ensemble , the local instantaneous displacement field @xmath78 defined over the set of lattice vectors @xmath79 of a reference lattice ( at the same density @xmath80 ) is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the instantaneous position of the particle tagged by the reference lattice point @xmath83 . in this paper",
    "we concentrate only on perfect crystalline lattices ; if topological defects such as dislocations are present the analysis below needs to be modified .",
    "the instantaneous lagrangian strain tensor @xmath84 defined at @xmath83 is then given by@xcite , @xmath85 the strains considered here are always small and so we , hereafter , neglect the non  -linear terms in the definition given above for simplicity .",
    "the derivatives are required at the reference lattice points @xmath83 and can be calculated by any suitable finite difference scheme once @xmath78 is known .",
    "we are now in a position to define coarse grained variables @xmath86 which are simply averages of the strain over a sub - block of size @xmath1 .",
    "the fluctuation of this variable then defines the size dependent compliance matrix @xmath87 . before proceeding further ,",
    "we introduce a compact voigt notation ( which replaces a pair of indices @xmath88 with one @xmath89 ) appropriate for two dimensional strains - the only case considered in this paper . using @xmath90 and @xmath91 we have , @xmath92 the only nonzero components of the compliance matrix are @xmath93 it is also useful to define the following linear combinations @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "once the block averaged strains @xmath86 are obtained , it is straight  -forward to calculate these fluctuations ( for each value of @xmath1 ) .    since we are interested in the elastic properties of the system far away from any phase transition , a quadratic functional for the helmholtz free energy @xmath34 suffices .",
    "we therefore use the following landau functional appropriate for a two dimensional solid involving coarse grained strains to quadratic order in strains and its derivatives . @xmath97",
    "the coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath99 are , of course , not all independent because of further symmetries@xcite which are present for the two dimensional triangular solid though this does not influence the rest of our analysis .",
    "note that , eq . ( [ eq : laneps ] ) is simply a sum of three independent functionals in @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 each of the form given in eq.([eq : landau ] ) .",
    "thus the analysis described in detail in section ii carries over almost unchanged .",
    "there is one small difference , however . even in the canonical ensemble with fixed box dimensions ,",
    "the microscopic strain fluctuations over the whole box are not zero but remains a small number of the order of @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the lattice parameter so that , @xmath105 incorporating this modification into eq.([eq : main ] ) we get , @xmath106 \\\\ \\nonumber                         &    & + { \\cal o}(x^4).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath107 takes the values @xmath108,@xmath109 or @xmath110 and @xmath111 and we have suppressed subscripts on @xmath44 and @xmath112 for clarity .",
    "the above equation eq.([eq : mainep ] ) can now be used to obtain the _ system size independent _ quantities @xmath113 , @xmath44 and @xmath112 .    once the finite size scaled compliances are obtained the elastic constants viz .",
    "the bulk modulus @xmath114 and the shear modulus @xmath115 are obtained simply using the formulae@xcite @xmath116 where we assume that the system is under an uniform hydrostatic pressure @xmath117 .",
    "the two expressions for @xmath115 should give identical results and constitutes an excellent internal check for numerical accuracy .",
    "this completes the description of our technique for obtaining elastic constants .",
    "it is obvious that throughout the derivation we do not ever refer to the interparticle interactions .",
    "the only place where this information is required is in the calculation of the pressure @xmath117 of the system  a quantity routinely calculated in simulations .",
    "this , as we show later , is not a limitation even for systems with hard core potentials , where the calculation of pressure is more involved@xcite .",
    "we now describe our results for two model , two dimensional , solids .",
    "the elastic constants in each case are obtained for a high density perfect triangular solid .",
    "the generalization of this method for higher dimensions , more complicated ( less symmetrical ) crystal types and even for amorphous materials is straightforward .",
    "hard disks interact with the extremely short ranged potential , @xmath118 where @xmath119 the hard sphere diameter can be used as the unit of length and there is no energy scale .",
    "this makes the hard disk system particularly easy to simulate and is a popular testing ground for theories and techniques@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a calculation of elastic constants in this system is difficult since a harmonic description for such a solid does not exist at zero temperature .",
    "the energy vanishes and the free energy is wholly entropic in origin . for this reason most computational methods for obtaining elastic constants which work for smooth potentials have to be either discarded or modified in order to study elastic properties of hard systems@xcite .",
    "the only previous study of the hard disk elastic moduli is by wojciechowski and brakai@xcite .",
    "these authors carried out a monte carlo simulation of @xmath120 hard disks in a box of variable shape in the constant stress ensemble@xcite .",
    "the elastic constants were obtained from the fluctuations in the shape of the entire box .",
    "results were checked for finite size effects by repeating a few test runs for @xmath121 and @xmath122 particles .    in our method",
    "the results derived in the previous sections carry over without any change to systems of particles interacting with hard potentials .",
    "further we automatically calculate finite size scaled quantities .",
    "we present results for elastic constants of the hard disk system in two dimensions for a range of densities @xmath123 from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations with systems with sizes varying from @xmath124 to @xmath125 particles .",
    "the simulations have been set up for a perfect triangular lattice in a slightly rectangular simulation box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the number of cells along each side of the box is adjusted to make the simulation box as close to a square as possible . in the hard disk system",
    "one can considerably accelerate the mc dynamics using special updating schemes@xcite .",
    "we use a square grid as an overlay on the simulation box , and choose the grid size to be small enough to accommodate only one disk .",
    "an occupancy list of the grid positions is computed and continuously updated . for an attempted move of a hard disk from one grid point to another",
    ", we first check if the new point is unoccupied and then check for overlap only with the particles occupying the neighboring grid points . at the density @xmath126= 1 a standard simulation had the length of 3@xmath127 @xmath128 mc steps ,",
    "every 10-th mc step has been taken for averaging observables , in particular the block analysis was done for @xmath129 random placements of the block .    in fig .",
    "( 5 ) we show the strain- strain fluctuations as a function of the relative sub - block size computed in a system with @xmath130 hard disks at a density of @xmath131 .",
    "the data are fitted to eq.([eq : mainep ] ) where we keep terms up to order @xmath132 .",
    "the fits to eq.([eq : mainep ] ) are excellent and the infinite system compliances @xmath113 can be determined immediately . to determine the sensitivity of our results to the total system size we have also simulated systems with @xmath133 and an extremely small system consisting of @xmath134 particles . using the `` infinite '' system values determined from the @xmath135 particle system it is , in principle , possible to predict the behaviour of the strain fluctuations @xmath136 for the other systems . in fig .",
    "( 6 ) we have plotted @xmath136 for @xmath137 and @xmath124 particles .",
    "the points are the simulation data while the curves are fits to eq.([eq : mainep ] ) where the value of @xmath138 was constrained to be fixed at that obtained from the data for @xmath139 particles .",
    "the results are seen to be almost insensitive to the total system size as expected .    once the compliances @xmath140 are obtained the elastic constants , in units of @xmath141 ,",
    "can be derived immediately using eq.([eq : bul]-[eq : sh2 ] ) .",
    "our results for densities other than @xmath142 were obtained from monte carlo simulations for @xmath135 hard disks . to obtain the pressure , which is required for evaluating the shear modulus @xmath115",
    ", we simply integrate our bulk modulus @xmath143 ( independent of the pressure in two dimensions ) starting from the rather high density @xmath144 where the free volume@xcite expression for the pressure @xmath145 is accurate .",
    "our results@xcite for the equation of state for the hard disk system is shown in fig .",
    "( 7 ) and those for the elastic constants are shown in fig .",
    "the two expressions for the shear modulus in eq.([eq : sh1],[eq : sh2 ] ) give almost identical results and this gives us confidence about the internal consistency of our method .",
    "we have also compared our results to those of wojciechowski and braka@xcite .",
    "we find that while their values of the pressure and bulk modulus are in good agreement with ours ( and with free volume theory ) they grossly overestimate the shear modulus .",
    "this is probably due to the extreme small size of their systems and/or insufficient averaging .",
    "our results for the sub - block analysis shows that finite size effects are non  -trivial for elastic strain fluctuations and they can not be evaluated by varying the total size of the system from @xmath146 to @xmath122 , an interval which is less than half of a decade@xcite .",
    "one immediate consequence of our results is that the cauchy relation@xcite @xmath147 is seen to be valid upto @xmath148 over the entire density range we studied ( see fig .",
    "( 9 ) ) though there is a systematic deviation which changes sign going from negative for small densities to positive as the density is increased .",
    "this is in agreement with the usual situation in a variety of real systems@xcite with central potentials and highly symmetric lattices and in disagreement with ref.@xcite .",
    "we have also compared our estimates for the elastic constants with the density functional theory ( dft ) of rhysov and tareyeva@xcite .",
    "we find that both the bulk and the shear moduli are grossly overestimated - sometimes by as much as 100% .",
    "the system of particles in two dimensions interacting by a purely repulsive inverse @xmath149 power pair potential @xmath150 of the form given by , @xmath151 has been studied@xcite quite extensively .",
    "this system has the advantage of being realistic without being too complicated , since the form of the potential ensures that the entire equation of state can be determined from that of a single isotherm@xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath152 and @xmath119 sets the scales for energy and distance respectively and can be both set equal to unity . both the zero and the finite temperature elastic constants of this system has been calculated over a large range of densities@xcite .",
    "we have used this system to test the applicablity of our method to molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "our results here are not as extensive as in the hard disk case and we obtain elastic constants only for a single state point .",
    "we simulate this system with a simple leap  -frog molecular dynamics code incorporating a nos hoover thermostat@xcite in order to generate configurations in the canonical @xmath153 ensemble .",
    "the temperature @xmath154 is fixed at @xmath49 and the density @xmath155 at @xmath156 - a state sufficiently far from melting .",
    "the number of particles were chosen to be @xmath157 which is same as that used in ref.@xcite and corresponds to @xmath158 unit cells of a triangular lattice within a nearly square box .",
    "starting from the perfect lattice initial configuration , the system was equilibrated for more than @xmath128 molecular dynamics time steps @xmath159 ( in units of @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the mass of the particles ) .",
    "subsequently , averages of thermodynamic quantities were calculated over @xmath162 uncorrelated configurations .",
    "our results for the elastic compliances @xmath140 are similar to that in the hard disk case and are shown in fig .",
    "( 10 ) .",
    "the final estimates for the bulk modulus @xmath163 and shear modulus @xmath164 ( in units of @xmath141 ) compare well with those of ref .",
    "@xcite ( viz . @xmath165 and @xmath166 ) .",
    "errors in our estimate for the bulk modulus arise from statistical error in the acquired data and from the fits this is around @xmath167 .",
    "the shear modulus being a more sensitive quantity to compute is less accurate and the two expressions for @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sh1],[eq : sh2 ] ) now differ by @xmath168 ( the number quoted above is the average value ) .",
    "this maybe due to the smaller size of our system compared to the hard disk case , and because subsequent configurations in molecular dynamics simulations are more correlated than in monte carlo .",
    "in summary , we show in this paper that a systematic coarse graining analysis of strain fluctuations yields elastic constants of solids from computer simulations to high accuracy .",
    "our method incorporates finite size scaling and produces elastic constants in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the procedure is simple to implement and is general enough to be carried out for any system without modification .",
    "before we end this paper , the following comments are , perhaps , in order .    _ the coarse graining variable:-  _ firstly",
    ", we introduced this work as a `` test '' case of a general coarse graining procedure which may be used to study the connection between microscopic computer simulations and long wavelength physics contained in continuum field theory approaches for phase transitions in solids . in this",
    "regard we would like to point out that we found , as usual , the choice of the coarse graining variable to be important .",
    "our results show that microscopic strains calculated by taking finite differences of the displacement field constitute the correct variable to coarse grain over .",
    "one could alternatively have averaged the displacement field @xmath169 and calculated the strains from the coarse grained @xmath170 .",
    "this procedure happens to produce wrong results giving us elastic constants which are orders of magnitude too large .    _",
    "the strain correlation length:-  _ one of the new results from our calculations is the correlation length @xmath171 of strain fluctuations .",
    "this is found to be small - @xmath172 lattice spacings - for all components of the strain - strain correlation functions and for both the systems .",
    "we have checked this independently by explicitly measuring the correlation function @xmath173 defined for all the lattice vectors @xmath83 of the two dimensional triangular reference lattice in the soft sphere system . though , the simple ornstein zernicke form is inadequate to describe detailed features of the correlation function and actual values for the correlation length is hard to estimate , preliminary results from our simulations do support the above contention .",
    "the correlation of the local density @xmath174 or its phase  the displacement field @xmath175 is , of course , long ranged , decaying algebraically as it should in the solid state .    _",
    "renormalization by defects:-  _ our results for the elastic constants are obtained for high density perfect solids . in general",
    "a solid contains point ( vacancies and interstitials ) and line ( dislocations ) defects .",
    "for example , in the hard disk case dislocations start appearing in our systems below a density of @xmath176 a range we have not explored in this paper . in principle , there is no reason why our method can not be adapted for systems containing defects though this involves considerable computational complexity .",
    "there are basically two problems which arise when one wishes to calculate elastic constants in the presence of defects .",
    "firstly , we have to ensure that the density of each type of defect on the average attain their equilibrium value .",
    "this is nontrivial because nucleation barriers for defects densities are usually high which means large system sizes and long simulation times are required .",
    "defect mobilities are sluggish in a solid but to ensure that they are fully equilibrated one has to wait long enough to allow a typical dislocation to travel a distance equal to the system size@xcite .",
    "secondly , once we are sure that our configurations contain , on the average , the required defect densities , we have to evaluate the strain field in presence of these defects .",
    "this is , by far , the easier part .",
    "defects can be either isolated point defects which arise in grand canonical simulations or vacancy  -interstitial pairs which nucleate pairs of dislocations of opposite sign .",
    "the concentration of point defects in solids is vanishingly small @xmath177 atomic percent and they are not expected to change the elastic constants substantially . in any case they can be easily taken into account by redefining the reference lattice points .",
    "topological defects introduce , in addition , a singular part in the displacement field so that the strain field can not now be evaluated simply by taking numerical derivatives .",
    "however , the singular contribution for each dislocation is known analytically - so that for a given configuration one can locate topological defects of each type and treat the smooth and the singular parts separately .",
    "lastly , we would like to point out that the above two problems viz .",
    "( 1 ) obtaining an equilibrium defect concentration and ( 2 ) evaluating the finite size scaling of singular strain fields of configurations containing defects are present in _ all _ techniques for calculating elastic constants although they seem not to have recieved so far the attention they deserve .",
    "the renormalization of elastic constants by dislocations can also be obtained approximately by using standard recursion relations@xcite once the core energy of a dislocation is known ( for instance from a separate simulation ) and the present ( manifestly `` bare '' ) values of the elastic constants are used as inputs . such a calculation has applications in a study of two dimensional melting@xcite .",
    "we are , at present , carrying out detailed calculations of the elastic constants , equation of state and dislocation core energies of the hard disk and inverse power triangular solids to investigate their melting behaviour .",
    "further , near to the melting transition additional finite size effects would be manifest ( due to diverging correlation lengths ) and they have to be taken into account separately which would necessarily involve simulations of a much larger scale than employed here . for example",
    ", it is known that near the liquid to hexatic transition ( @xmath178 ) @xmath179 hard disks are required@xcite in order to reach the thermodynamic limit .",
    "_ evaluation of local stresses:-  _",
    "lastly , we would like to point out that our procedure can also be used in an `` inverse '' mode where knowing the elastic constants for a system , strain fluctuations can be used to calculate local stresses .",
    "this is especially useful in experimental studies@xcite of melting behaviour of colloidal particles where high quality digitized particle images are available .",
    "efforts in this direction are in progress .",
