    "with this paper we begin a series devoted to the results of a prolonged high resolution spectroscopic monitoring of early type members of young open clusters , trapezium systems and ob associations .",
    "the emphasis is on accurate and extensive radial velocities ( secured over several years ) , suitable to trace ( @xmath1 ) the internal kinematics , ( @xmath2 ) the galactic motion , ( @xmath3 ) the binary star content and the spectroscopic orbits .",
    "the high dispersion spectra are also useful to derive the projected rotational velocities , the chemical composition and the evolutionary status of the member stars as well as to study the interstellar medium inside and towards such young stellar aggregates .",
    "these latter aspects are however broadly outside the scope of the present series and will be considered elsewhere .",
    "our program encompasses a selection of young stellar aggregates spanning a range in total mass , number of member stars , age , total energy , etc .",
    "the targets have been chosen , whenever possible , among those with already published high quality astrometry and photometry .",
    "we believe that much can be learned by extensive and homogeneous high  res spectral campaign data on such targets and to this aim we begun in 1990 a long term program with the telescopes and spectrographs of the asiago astrophysical observatory . the ambitious goal is to search for _ observationally",
    "_ proved grand - relations governing the dynamical evolution of the young stellar aggregates which could then be compared with the predictions of n - body simulations .",
    "such grand - relations are expected to become apparent when a significant number of young stellar aggregates will have been studied in the most homogeneous way and for such a reason we will postpone later in the present series a throughout discussion of the results accumulated on the way .    we start with a so far poorly studied trapezium system ( bd+00@xmath01617 ) at the heart of a dim and very young open cluster ( bochum  2 ) , which lies at a great distance in the general anti  center galactic direction ( at @xmath4 14 kpc galacto - centric distance ) .",
    "trapezium systems are groups of three or more stars whose apparent separations onto the sky are similar , as for the prototype of the class , the four o stars at the core of the orion open cluster and nebula .",
    "ob associations contain typically three to five trapezia and these configurations have a high frequency among t - associations too . within stellar associations ,",
    "trapezia appear to cluster close to the nuclei of open clusters and emission nebulae .",
    "a trapezium - like configuration is in general dynamically unstable and therefore it must be young .",
    "it has to evolve either into ( @xmath1 ) _ hierarchical systems _",
    "( i.e. ones in which the separation of successive binaries increases by large factors ; they are dynamically stable and are present among systems of all ages ) , or into ( @xmath2 ) _ hard binaries _ ( with possible ejection from the system of one or more of the trapezium components ) .",
    "ambartsumian ( 1954 ) computed in @xmath5 au the largest stable dimension of a trapezium in the solar vicinity against perturbation by passing stars : the one order of magnitude larger extension ( 1@xmath6 au ) for cataloged trapezia reinforces the notion that they must be dynamically young systems .",
    "the first catalog of trapezium systems has been compiled by ambartsumian ( 1954 ) , listing 108 entries and a more recent one ( 442 systems ) has been presented by salukvadze ( 1978 ) .",
    "trapezia have been traditionally found by filtering catalogs of visual binaries , like the index catalog of visual binary stars ( ids ) by jeffers et al .",

    "the large variability of the radial velocities of # 20 and # 21 compared to the constancy for # 23 ( cf .",
    "table  3 ) argues for # 20 and # 21 to be binaries .",
    "we have therefore proceeded with period search and determination of the spectroscopic orbits for the latter two stars .",
    "the orbital periods of # 20 and # 21 turned out to be @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the orbital solutions computed from these orbital periods are listed in table  4 and in graphical form are presented in figures  3 and 4 .",
    "the errors of the orbital solutions are of the order of 5% or less .",
    "the larger errors for the eccentricities may results from the uneven distribution of the observations along the orbital phase .",
    "to estimate the projected rotational velocities of the program stars ( @xmath39 ) we have selected a sample of early type objects from the rotational velocity standards given by sletteback et al .",
    "we have observed them with the same echelle+ccd set - up used for bd+00@xmath01617 .",
    "helium lines are notoriously a good choice for rotational velocity determination in early type stars ( they are less affected by stark broadening compared to hydrogen and are stronger than metallic lines ) .",
    "@xmath40 5876   is the best recorded helium line in our spectra of bd+00@xmath01617 and the half - intensity width ( hiw ) of the @xmath40 5876   hei line has been measured on all standard stars . in figure  7 the hiw of the @xmath40 5876   hei line for the sletteback et al .",

    "as expected , a quite straight linear relation exists in figure  7 between the projected rotational velocity and the hiw , equally valid for main sequence and giant stars .",
    "a least square fit gives : @xmath44 the average hiw of the @xmath40 5876   hei line for the bd+00@xmath01617 stars as measured on all available spectra is given in table  5 together with the corresponding projected rotational velocity inferred from relation ( 8) .",
    "the low values of @xmath39 for bd+00@xmath01617 stars agree with the high fraction ( 2/3 ) of binaries , a general trend first noted by abt & hunter ( 1962  and confirmed by later investigations , cf .",
    "hack & struve 1969 ) who pointed out how tidal energy dissipation in close binaries is expected to act as a breaking mechanism on stellar rotation .",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) and half - intensity width ( hiw ) of the @xmath40 5876   hei line have been measured on all spectra of the program stars .",
    "the individual measures are plotted as function of time in figures  5 and 6 . in table  5",
    "the dispersion of the measurements , their mean and the error of the mean are given .",
    "there is a striking evidence : hei lines in the two binary stars vary by a large amount both in equivalent width and in broadness while they are remarkably constant in the non - binary # 23 star .",
    "the amplitude of variation is one order of magnitude the error of the measurements ( fixed by the dispersion around the mean for the non - binary # 23 ) and therefore the detection has to be considered as quite robust .",
    "the variation can in principle either be ( @xmath1 ) intrinsic to the primary , or ( @xmath2 ) ascribed to the visibility of the spectrum of the secondary blended with the primary s one . the following discussion leads to the conclusion that the variations are most probably intrinsic to the primary .",
    "first , we discuss the possibility that the variations are induced by the visibility of the spectrum of the secondary .",
    "both the ew and hiw of the hei line vary by a factor of two .",
    "thus the intensity of the hei line in the companion star should be similar to that of the primary and the two must have similar brightness . from jasheck & jaschek ( 1987 ) a general upper limit to the _ intrinsic _ rotational velocity of late o stars may be taken to be @xmath45300 km sec@xmath19 .",
    "comparison with the projected rotational velocity in table  3 gives a lower limit to the inclination of the rotational axis .",
    "the assumption that rotational axis and the orbital axis are roughly aligned puts the constraint on the mass of the companion from the mass function in table  4 . for star # 20",
    "this is @xmath46 _ { \\#20 }   \\leq 0.64    \\nonumber \\\\",

    "conti 1975 ) .",
    "this _ maximum _ mass for the secondary in # 20 correspond to a b5 main sequence , which is vastly too dim to rival in brightness and hei line intensity with the o9 primary .",
    "the hei line variability in # 20 therefore can not be ascribed to the visibility of the companion and it is therefore intrinsic to the primary .    for # 21 ( an o7  v from table  1 ) the situation remains unsettled because the same above line of reasoning on inclination leads to @xmath49 _ { \\#21 }   \\leq 8.4    \\nonumber \\\\ & \\longrightarrow & m_{2}^{\\#21}\\ \\leq   31   \\ \\",
    "m_\\odot \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is compatible with a companion of the same mass and therefore the same brightness .",
    "the most stringent argument on the nature of the hei line variability comes however from the search of a correlation between extrema in the hei variation and extrema in the radial velocities .",
    "the result is presented in figure  8 .",
    "maximum split between the lines of the primary and secondary ( and therefore a maximum hiw value ) has to be expected when the primary is passing through radial velocity extrema , resulting in a v - shaped distribution of the points in figure  8 .",
    "the latter clearly shows this not to be the case for both # 21 and # 20 , which hei line variability is intrinsic to the o primary star and appears triggered by the binarity .",
    "absorption line variability is known to occur in early type stars , both single and binary systems , although no satisfactory explanation yet exists for the phenomenon .",
    "jaschek , jaschek and kucewicz ( 1968 ) reported that in hd 125823 ( b7  iii ) the hei lines vary enormously from those of a b2 to those of a b9 star , while all other lines remain constant and photometric and rv variations are _ at most _ marginal ( norris 1971 ) .",
    "we too ( lattanzi , massone and munari 1992 ) identified two helium variable stars ( their mean spectra suggesting a classification toward late main sequence b stars ) in the young open cluster ngc 225 . _ struve  sahade effect _ is termed by howarth et al .",
