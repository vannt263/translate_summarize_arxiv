    "information gleaned from spectroenergy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies are key to our understanding of their age , metallicity , stellar population content and star formation histories .",
    "analysis of sed data has usually invoked either population synthesis , which uses a library of spectral templates ( pickles 1985 ) , or evolutionary models , a method of convolving stellar isochrones with star formation rates and initial mass functions ( bruzual 1983 , arimoto and yoshii 1986 , guiderdoni and rocca- volmerange 1987 ) . in this series of papers ( fiala , rakos and stockton 1986 ; rakos , fiala and schombert 1988 ; rakos , schombert and kreidl 1991 ; rakos and schombert 1995 ) ,",
    "a system of narrow band filters has been used to replace the sed sampling at the sacrifice of resolution for a gain in signal - to - noise . and , just as stellar models are tested by predictions of integrated quantities such as total luminosity , mass , radius and effective temperature , population synthesis results",
    "can then be tested by comparison to predictions of integrated stellar content and metallicity of a galaxy as given by narrow band indices .",
    "thus , theoretical models , which produce spectral energy distributions as a function of age , can be convolved to produce synthetic colors for comparison to narrow band observations at various redshifts .",
    "our project has approached this problem through the use of a modified strmgren filter system called @xmath0 to distinguish it from the original @xmath1 system . our primary goal was to investigate the color evolution of ellipticals , testing the hypothesis that ellipticals are the result of a single burst where all the stars formed at an epoch near the time of galaxy formation and later aged through passive stellar evolution . however , in the previous paper in this series ( rakos and schombert 1995 ) , the data revealed an extended butcher - oemler effect ( the increasing fraction of blue to red galaxies in distant clusters ) out to redshifts of 0.9 and containing up to 80% of the cluster population as blue galaxies ( versus the previous values of 40% at redshift of 0.4 ) .",
    "deep hst images of intermediate redshift clusters ( dressler et al .",
    "1994a , b ) indicate that , while the brightest blue galaxies have disturbed morphologies suggestive of an origin of their blue colors from tidally induced star formation , a majority of the butcher - oemler galaxies have normal , late - type morphology .",
    "the goal of this paper is to combine the information obtained from narrow band photometry of nearby spirals , starburst , seyferts and interacting galaxies in order to search for signatures of starburst activity that can then be linked to the @xmath0 photometry of butcher - oemler galaxies in distant clusters .",
    "the procedure used herein is fourfold .",
    "first , the @xmath0 system will be linked to the original strmgren system for stars to establish a baseline stellar sequence .",
    "second , synthetic colors for a range of galaxy types will be produced to map the behavior of the @xmath0 system on galaxies with composite stellar populations and varying star formation histories .",
    "third , photometry of interacting / merging galaxies will be presented to understand the signature of starburst phenomenon in galaxies . and",
    "lastly , comparison of the above data will be made to high redshift clusters to examine the hypothesis that blue cluster galaxies are the result of similar starburst activity .",
    "the strmgren @xmath1 filter system and its extensions ( strmgren 1966 , wood 1969 ) were developed to provide an accurate means of measuring the temperature , chemical composition and surface gravity of stars , without resorting to high resolution spectroscopy , by selecting regions of the stellar sed for narrow band photometry which are particularly sensitive to these specific properties .",
    "this provided an efficient and quantifiable method of sampling stellar types without the use of qualitative spectral classification ( e.g. the mk scheme ) .",
    "the @xmath1 system , modified for this project and designated as the @xmath0 system , covers three regions in the near - uv and blue portion of the spectrum ( see figure 1 of rakos and schombert 1995 ) .",
    "the first region is longward of 4600 , where the influence of absorption lines is minor .",
    "this is characteristic of the @xmath3 ( 4650 ) and @xmath4 ( 5500 ) filters which produce a continuum color index , @xmath5 , free of metal and surface gravity effects .",
    "the second region is a band shortward of 4600 , but above the balmer discontinuity .",
    "this region , covered by our @xmath6 ( 4100 ) filter , is strongly influenced by metal absorption lines ( i.e. fe , cn ) particularly for spectral classes f to m which dominate the contribution of light in galaxies .",
    "the third region is a band shortward of 4000 , below the effective limit of crowding of the balmer absorption lines , the so - called 4000 break .",
    "the 4000 break has been used by several studies as a measure of the evolution of galaxies ( hamilton 1985 , spinrad 1986 , dressler and shectman 1987 , kimble et al .",
    "1989 ) and the @xmath7 ( 3500 ) filter is a good measure of the blue side of this feature .",
    "the @xmath6 filter is in a good position to sample the red side of the 4000 break with main transmission between 4050 and 4250 and , thus , the @xmath8 color is a convenient measure of this feature .",
    "our slight redefinition of the strmgren system was primarily made to allow for a new definition of the blue side of the @xmath7 filter and to link the photometry system with the more reliable spectrophotometry standards that are now rapidly appearing in the literature .",
    "the original @xmath9 passband in the strmgren system is produced by the combination of the ultraviolet cutoff of the earth s atmosphere and a red blocking filter .",
    "but , as soon as the observations concern redshifted filters ( such as distant clusters of galaxies , see rakos and schombert 1995 ) , the transmission center of the filter is moved longward and , since the atmospheric cutoff does not redshift , the filter widens .",
    "our solution is to substitute the original @xmath9 filter by a 200 wide interference filter , centered at the original @xmath9 filter transmission peak .",
    "however , the interference filter is slightly narrower than the original strmgren @xmath9 filter and produces a slight color term with respect to the new @xmath7 system ( see below ) .    in this section",
    ", the @xmath0 system will be related to the original strmgren system for comparison to model atmospheres in the literature and to generate an understanding of the properties of the photometry system as it applies to the stellar populations in galaxies .",
    "there are two methods which can be used to derive the necessary transformations .",
    "first , the model atmospheres of kurucz ( 1979 ) and bell and gustaffson ( 1978 ) can be convolved with the @xmath0 filters and compared to the theoretical @xmath1 indices of those models in lester et al .",
    "this first method was described in rakos et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , but with only limited success due to the lack of range in stellar types .",
    "the second method is to use spectrophotometric standards where the strmgren indices are derived from spectrum scans .",
    "this second , and more realistic , method was performed by collecting 31 stars from the literature with known spectrophotometry and measured strmgren photometry to form the transformations .",
    "the sample is from the irs standard star manual ( barnes and hayes 1984 ) plus additional standards from gunn and stryker ( 1983 ) .",
    "the strmgren color indices are from hauck and mermilliod ( 1980 ) .",
    "the resulting transformations are :    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    note that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the old strmgren metal - line and surface gravity indices given as @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the accuracy of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 transformations is @xmath190.02 magnitudes .",
    "as mentioned above , the amplitude of the 4000 break is related to the @xmath8 color index .",
    "a comparison of the break values @xmath20 ( dressler and shectman 1987 ) for the galaxies in  3 and the @xmath8 index reveals a linear regression of    @xmath21    with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 .",
    "the 4000 break is correlated with effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity in stars .",
    "however , for an integrated stellar population , it is primarily a temperature indicator ( see hamilton 1985 for a full discussion of the properties of the 4000 break in stars and galaxies ) .",
    "thus , the amplitude of the break is particularly sensitive to galaxy evolutionary effects such as the mean age of the stellar population ( position of the main sequence turnoff point ) and any recent epochs of massive star formation ( presence of hot , young stars ) .",
    "this will also be the role of the @xmath8 index .",
    "the three primary stellar atmospheric parameters are surface gravity , metal content and temperature . these three parameters also dominate the integrated light from galaxies except that surface gravity becomes the ratio of dwarf to giant stars in the composite population and temperature becomes the mean age of the stellar population as given by the position of the turnoff point and the contribution of massive , young stars .",
    "their combination determines our interpretation of multicolor photometry of galaxies as guided by models of galaxy evolution ( see tinsley 1980 for a review of the topic ) . the visual light from most normal galaxies is dominated by giants , with the low mass main sequence stars playing a minor role ( rose 1985 ) .",
    "the metal content of most giant galaxies is between solar and 0.1 of solar ( schombert et al .",
    "1993 , burstein 1985 ) . in previous papers",
    ", it has been shown that the color index @xmath5 is relatively free of metal and surface gravity effects .",
    "the @xmath22 index is also free of surface gravity effects , but is sensitive to the metal content of a galaxy . in addition",
    ", the @xmath8 , @xmath23 and @xmath17 indices can be used as a signature of hot stars ( i.e. recent star formation and mean age ) due to their sensitivity to the total near - uv flux of a galaxy .    in this section",
    ", the spectrophotometric data published by gunn and stryker ( 1983 ) has been used to build two - color diagrams for stars in our modified strmgren system .",
    "figures 1 and 2 display the synthetic colors for 162 standards of the gunn - stryker catalog . for @xmath5 vs @xmath22",
    ", an excellent correlation exists between these two colors , as would be expected , but this correlation is surprisingly independent of the mean surface gravity ( i.e. stellar type ) . note that the reddening vector is parallel to the star sequence .",
    "the derivation of the reddening vector according to sinnerstad ( 1980 ) and crawford ( 1975 ) is    @xmath24    and    @xmath25    from which it can be shown that    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    the ratio of total to selective absorption is 3.3 , according to moreno and moreno ( 1975 ) , and it follows that    @xmath31    thus , the reddening vector is parallel to the stellar sequence for @xmath22 vs @xmath5 and slightly orthogonal for @xmath8 vs @xmath5 .    for these color indices , metallicity effects are more dominant than surface gravity effects .",
    "unfortunately , spectrophotometry of stars with low metal content is rare . to investigate the variance with metallicity ,",
    "35 stars were collected from the literature with the @xmath32 $ ] equal or less than @xmath33 ( olsen 1983 , francois 1986 , magain 1987 and tourkin et al .",
    "1985 ) and their spectrophotometry was transformed to our color system . within the range @xmath34 the color indices form a linear sequence such that    @xmath35    with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 ( see solid line in the figure 1 ) .",
    "the difference in figure 1 between the solar metallicity stars from the gunn and stryker spectrophotometric catalog is evident , but not overwhelming .",
    "similar deviations for stars of different metal content in @xmath17 index is also present , but this was previously known from strmgren photometry studies ( see gustaffson and bell 1978 ) .",
    "therefore , metallicity effects are not expected to strongly influence the discussions on star formation histories of galaxies .",
    "the second set of two - color diagrams is the @xmath8 vs @xmath5 diagram also shown in figure 1 .",
    "low temperature red giants are well separated from dwarfs in figure 1 , but the stellar types become blurred for colors bluer than @xmath36 . the behavior of stellar types in this diagram is similar to broadband two color diagrams ( e.g. johnson @xmath37 ) with its classic `` s '' shaped sequence .",
    "the third and fourth set of two - color diagrams are @xmath5 vs @xmath17 and @xmath8 vs @xmath17 , where the distributions are identical for the various stellar types .",
    "however , note that the reddening vector is orthogonal to the stellar sequences in both diagrams .    for comparison to the stellar sequences , figures 3 and 4 display the same diagrams for bright galaxies of various hubble types .",
    "the galaxy data are computed synthetic colors from high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectra published by gunn and oke ( 1975 ) , yee and oke ( 1978 ) , de bruyn and sargent ( 1978 ) , kennicutt ( 1992a ) and ashby et al .",
    "the galaxies are broken into four classes ; ellipticals , spirals , seyferts and starbursts , and plotted as separate symbols in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "in general , for the @xmath22 vs @xmath5 plane , normal galaxies ( ellipticals and spirals ) follow the stellar sequence outlined in figure 1 .",
    "seyfert galaxies are bluer than spirals ( the bluest objects are all seyferts ) , but lie near the stellar sequence .",
    "note that the spectrophotometry from which these synthetic colors are based , have been observed with small aperture or slit sizes .",
    "thus , these values are strongly influenced by the nonthermal continuum component in seyferts ( the filters avoid most of the strongest emission lines ) .",
    "lastly , starburst galaxies deviate from the trend for normal and seyfert galaxies by lying well below the stellar sequence , having bluer @xmath22 colors for their @xmath5 index ( i.e. extra uv flux ) .",
    "dwarf stars are numerous in galaxies and are a dominate portion of the mass , but their integrated light has a minor influence on the total color of a typical bright galaxy ( rose 1985 ) .",
    "the @xmath8 vs @xmath5 diagram is the most sensitive to changes in stellar type ( main sequence to giants ) .",
    "however , the galaxy data displays little indication of any change in the dominate stellar type with respect to the integrated light .",
    "no differences between ellipticals and spirals are distinguishable even though there are extensive differences in their stellar populations .    for a reddening comparison ,",
    "the position of a b0i star is marked in figures 3 and 4 along with the reddening vector for that same star under 3 magnitudes of extinction .",
    "the data in figures 3 and 4 confirms results from previous studies of starburst galaxies that their position in the @xmath8 vs @xmath5 diagram is similar to that of an object with a very young , hot stellar population shrouded in gas and dust . under this interpretation , many of the starburst galaxies show a intrinsic reddening of between 0.5 to 3 mags of extinction .    in both @xmath17 plots for galaxies ( see figure 4 ) ,",
    "the starburst galaxies are well separated from the normal ellipticals , spirals and seyferts , and are distinguished by consistently having @xmath17 values of less than @xmath38 .",
    "as with figure 3 , the reddening vector is shown with an origin of a b0ia star and 3 magnitudes of extinction .",
    "it is clear from these plots that the @xmath17 index provides the best signature for a starburst phenomenon in galaxies and both figures 3 and 4 suggest that the narrow band optical properties of starburst galaxies are dominated by a strongly reddened , young stellar population , as one would expect from their far - ir properties ( see devereux 1989 ) .",
    "the reddening of individual galaxies can be estimated using reddening free parameters introduced by strmgren .",
    "the @xmath0 photometric system has similar expressions :    @xmath39 =   ( bz - yz ) - 0.66 e(b - v)\\ ] ]    @xmath40 = ( uz - vz ) - 0.67 e(bz - yz)\\ ] ]    @xmath41 = ( vz - yz ) - 1.61 e(bz - yz)\\ ] ]    @xmath42 = mz + 0.39 e(bz - yz)\\ ] ]    @xmath43 = cz - 0.06 e(bz - yz).\\ ] ]    in this manner , an estimate of the unknown amount of reddening can be made and , therefore , our indices will only be dependent on the age and the total mass of the starburst .",
    "these are still highly degenerate quantities , however , the color indices can be decoupled from the non - evolutionary properties of the galaxy .",
    "the dependence on age and burst strength of the underlying stellar population can be calibrated using theoretical models of starburst galaxies . to this end",
    ", the sed models of leitherer and heckman ( 1995 ) have been used to construct synthetic colors in order to follow changes in the @xmath0 color indices with the time .    to illustrate the changes in our four colors (",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath8 , @xmath22 and @xmath5 ) two different models were considered .",
    "the first is a combination of a standard elliptical ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ; @xmath46 and @xmath47 , see schombert et al .",
    "1993 ) with a starburst of total mass @xmath48 , solar metallicity , a saltpeter imf ( @xmath49 ) and an upper mass limit of 100 @xmath50 .",
    "the evolution of the colors is shown in figure 5 for three cases ; one where the elliptical galaxy has the same total luminosity as the starburst ( solid line ) , the second where the elliptical galaxy is one magnitude fainter than the starburst ( dotted line ) and the third where the elliptical galaxy is one magnitude brighter than the starburst ( dashed line ) .",
    "note that the luminosity , rather than burst mass , is used for normalization and the brightness of the burst is taken as the peak luminosity at 5500 immediately after the start of the burst ( t = @xmath51 years ) .",
    "several obvious trends are visible in figure 5 .",
    "all the color indices move progressively from blue to red as the burst ages , although this progression is not necessarily smooth due to subtleties in the combination of the stellar tracks of various stellar masses . for example , there is a red bump at log @xmath52 due to a post - agb phase .",
    "another notable point is that both @xmath22 and @xmath5 approach the red color of an elliptical by @xmath53 years of the initial burst , making starburst detection difficult in a relatively short time .    surprisingly , the 4000 break color , @xmath8 , is the least sensitive index for detecting a past burst event",
    ". the @xmath8 color approaches an elliptical value after only approximately @xmath54 years , independent of burst strength relative to the luminosity of the underlying population .",
    "figure 1 in rakos and schombert ( 1995 ) , where the spectrum of an old composite population ( 17 gyrs ) is compared with one of a young population ( 1.5 gyrs ) , depicts this effect . a strong",
    ", intermediate age population actually produces more flux in the @xmath6 band relative to the @xmath7 band due to a heavy balmer contribution from a stars .",
    "this , in turn , implies rapid changes @xmath8 index once the o and b stars evolve to become red giants .",
    "this would also explain why the 4000 break has produced mixed results as an indicator of galaxy evolution in low to intermediate redshift samples ( see dressler 1987 ) since an artificial reddening of the index would appear to mimic normal ellipticals if other colors were not measured for comparison .",
    "this is also evident in our previous work on high redshift cluster blue galaxies ( rakos and schombert 1995 ) .",
    "figure 5 of that paper demonstrates that although the uv flux of this population changes dramatically beyond @xmath55 ( as measured by @xmath23 ) , the @xmath56 colors are indistinguishable from the lower redshift galaxies .",
    "the red rise in @xmath8 colors at log @xmath57 has a corresponding blue dip in @xmath22 and @xmath5 and indicates that blue galaxies are better selected by longer baseline continuum colors rather than 4000 colors .",
    "the @xmath17 index is the most sensitive of all our indices to the existence of an underlying burst population having the largest magnitude change during the aging of the burst . and",
    ", significant differences are visible up to @xmath58 years , providing a greater range of detection for the @xmath17 index .",
    "the sharp red bump at @xmath53 years is due to a sudden onset of post giant branch supergiants from the initial burst , however , its time phase is small .",
    "notice this bump is stronger for a stronger burst due to a larger number of intermediate mass stars climbing the agb .",
    "the second experiment with the theoretical models of leitherer and heckman is the combination of a spiral , with constant star formation , and a burst as shown in figure 6 . in this example , the sb galaxy ngc 3227 was selected .",
    "ngc 3227 displays a moderate level of star formation ( kennicutt 1992b ) with nominal colors of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the three curves in figure 6 are the same as in figure 5 with the initial burst set to 1 mag below the luminosity of the spiral at 5500 ( dashed line ) , equal in luminosity ( solid line ) and 1 mag above ( dotted line ) .",
    "the trends in figure 6 are the same as was found for an elliptical plus star burst combination , however , the separation between the various burst strengths is less distinct in the early epochs due to the fact that the underlying population is already fairly blue from the constant disk star formation typical of a spiral .",
    "again , note that the @xmath8 colors redden faster than any of the other filter combinations and that the stronger the burst , the redder the peak at log @xmath57 , opposite to initial expectations for blue filters .",
    "also , as with the elliptical plus starburst model , the @xmath17 index is the most sensitive to detecting a past starburst event .",
    "for both the elliptical and spiral underlying models , @xmath17 has the shallowest slope with time and will show evidence of a past starburst long after the other color indices have approached quiescent colors .",
    "to confirm the previous sections results based on synthetic colors from spectrophotometry , new narrow band photometry , in the same filter sets as used for our high redshift work , was obtained for 13 arp and markarian galaxies .",
    "the sample , listed in table 1 , was selected based either on their far - ir , submillimeter or emission line properties to be systems of extremely high current rates of star formation and/or high molecular gas content , or by having a disturbed morphology suggestive of a recent merger of a gas - rich spiral ( see schombert et al .",
    "table 1 presents the galaxies selected where column 1 displays the galaxy name , column 2 contains the galaxy coordinates ( epoch 1950 ) and column 3 displays the galaxy redshift .",
    "the ccd data for the arp / markarian sample were obtained on the lowell observatory hall ( 1.8 m ) and perkins ( 1.1 m ) telescopes .",
    "the imaging device on the 1.8 m telescope was a ti 800 by 800 ccd with an image scale of 0.86 arcsecs per pixel .",

    "aperture photometry , centered on regions of peak intensity , was performed using the iraf reduction package after erase line subtraction and flattening .",
    "corrections for galactic reddening followed the prescription of burstein and heiles ( 1978 ) .",
    "small k - corrections to final colors follow the procedure outlined in fiala , rakos and stockton ( 1986 ) . for the redshifts of the selected galaxies ( see table 1 ) , these corrections were always less than 0.02 in @xmath17 .",
    "isophotal maps from the @xmath4 images are presented in figure 7 .",
    "in addition to the photometry of selected regions and the isophotal maps in figure 7 , @xmath4 surface brightness profiles of each galaxy were also analyzed . due to the well - known irregular isophotal shapes of the sample galaxies , ellipse fitting was not practical or meaningful .",
    "instead , a procedure of extracting wedge cuts along the minor and major axis was used .",

    "* mrk 480 * : this system is most probably a merging galaxy pair , both disk galaxies based on their exponential profiles . both galaxies show fading starburst signatures of intermediate mass b and a stars ( mazzarella and boroson 1993 ) .    * mrk 496 * : this galaxy has two compact , blue nuclei with only moderate intrinsic absorption based on very blue @xmath8 colors . the surface brightness profile is exponential in the interior and irregular at the edge .",
    "this galaxy is an ultraluminous iras source ( log @xmath64 = 11.33 , condon et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "figures 9 and 10 display the photometry for the arp / mrk sample in the same fashion as figures 1 through 4 .",
    "the photometry for different apertures of the same objects are connected by lines .",
    "also shown on the diagrams are boxes that outline the 90% regions for ellipticals , seyferts and starburst galaxies from figures 3 and 4 .",
    "there is a small trend of blue gradients in @xmath22 , @xmath5 and @xmath17 .",
    "the exception to this trend is found in the @xmath8 vs @xmath5 diagram where redder @xmath8 indices are found for bluer @xmath5 ( see discussion in  4 ) .",
    "the main result from figures 9 and 10 is that a majority of the arp / mrk objects occupy the same region of the two color diagrams that the starburst sample defined .",
    "this confirms our interpretation of the narrow band colors , particularly the @xmath17 differences for starburst galaxies , in their ability to detect a photometric signature of a starburst versus agn activity or normal disk star formation ( constant sfr ) .",
    "a significant fraction ( 25% ) have elliptical - like colors and profile shapes ( i.e. @xmath63 ) , however , it should be noted that several of the arp objects appear to be interactions between ellipticals and spiral disks . in figure 10 ,",
    "the elliptical plus starburst tracks from figure 5 are plotted in the @xmath17 plane ( dotted line corresponding to the equal luminosity model ) .",
    "many of the starburst colors are consistent with ages of @xmath54 years or younger , if notable reddening is present , which is in agreement with dynamical models of the star formation history of interacting galaxies ( mihos and hernquist 1994 ) .",
    "the @xmath17 vs @xmath8 diagram indicates that many of the red objects could be old starbursts with ages of greater than @xmath53 years .",
    "outside of blue elliptical colors and weak starburst indices , only one galaxy ( arp 81a ) displays consistent seyfert colors ( arp 118 , a known seyfert 2 , lies on the boundary between ellipticals and seyferts ) .",
    "the lack of seyfert colors is probably due to contamination and mixture of stellar populations that occurs with the wider aperture sizes compared to the narrower slits of the spectroscopy surveys .",
    "from the theoretical models in  4 plus the synthetic colors from spectrophotometry and new photometry of arp / mrk galaxies presented in  5 , a fairly consistent picture is outlined for the photometric signature of a starburst event , old or new , in a composite stellar population .",
    "although blue @xmath22 and @xmath5 colors are found in starburst galaxies , reddening distorts the interpretation of the colors with respect to age and strength of the burst .",
    "the @xmath8 or 4000 index is a good measure for very young starbursts , however , intermediate mass stars produce artificially red colors ( see  4 ) .",
    "the most powerful indicator , as seen in figure 4 , is the @xmath17 index where a value less than @xmath38 indicates a starburst regardless of reddening .",
    "the @xmath17 index is also the most sensitive to detecting old starbursts hidden within an elliptical population since it is more sensitive to turnoff stars and evolves slowly from the time of the initial burst ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "figure 11 displays the @xmath17 values for the ellipticals , spirals , seyfert and starburst spectrophotometry of  3 ( mean values are indicated by an arrow at the top of each histogram ) .",
    "although there is some overlap in the range of @xmath17 values for each galaxy type , the ellipticals have the reddest @xmath17 value of 0.02 and starbursts fall at the blue end of @xmath650.29 .",
    "spirals and seyferts have mean values between @xmath660.05 and @xmath660.10 .",
    "also shown in figure 11 are the data from rakos and schombert ( 1995 ) for the distant cluster sample divided into two redshift bins at the top right , and the @xmath67 galaxies divided by @xmath5 color into red and blue galaxies ( see that paper for a full description of the sample ) .",
    "the butcher - oemler galaxies ( @xmath67 blue galaxies in the bottom right panel of figure 11 ) have a mean color indistinguishable from the mean for the spiral sample",
    ". however , the distribution of butcher - oemler galaxies differs from the normal spirals distribution by having a notable blue tail .",
    "we also note that the bluest butcher - oemler galaxies are often the brightest galaxies in their respective clusters .",
    "the extreme blue members of this color distribution must attribute their colors to a starburst phenomenon since neither spirals or seyferts in the low redshift sample display these colors .",
    "this is an important distinction since spectroscopy surveys of distant clusters have isolated a high fraction of cluster galaxies with strong emission lines ( dressler and gunn 1983 ) which offers an alternative explanation of the butcher - oemler effect in terms of either high levels of current star formation ( i.e. strong emission from hii regions ) or increased agn phenomenon with higher redshift .",
    "our @xmath0 filter system specifically avoids the dominant emission lines in agn activity and focuses on the underlying continuum emission from the hot gas and stellar populations .",
    "thus , the lack of agreement in @xmath17 with the seyfert samples would discount the agn effects in favor of strong star formation as the explanation for the butcher - oemler effect .",
    "this photometric result is consistent with the recent morphological results from hst imaging of @xmath68 clusters by dressler et al .",
    "( 1994a , b ) . in that study it was found that , while some of the brightest blue galaxies showed evidence of enhanced star formation due to tidal effects or mergers , most of the blue cluster galaxies are normal , late - type spirals and irregulars , their blue colors being due to normal star formation rates and histories .",
    "the number of disturbed systems , ones which had clearly undergone a recent tidal encounter or full merger , is higher in these distant clusters as compared to present - day cluster populations , but represent less than 10% of the cluster population .",
    "dressler et al . ( 1994b ) also notes that the morphologically disturbed systems are the brightest blue galaxies , supporting a starburst interpretation for their origin .    the morphological information combined with our photometric results indicated that the color distribution of the butcher - oemler galaxies in figure 11 is due to two components .",
    "the first is a sequence of morphologically late - type galaxies with normal star formation rates and histories .",
    "the second component is a blue tail composed of galaxies with starburst colors and disturbed morphologies .",
    "we also note that the @xmath8 or 4000 break colors of the high redshift blue cluster galaxies are not as strongly blue as compared to the continuum colors ( e.g. @xmath23 or @xmath5 ) .",
    "the theoretical models of leitherer and heckman ( 1995 ) demonstrate that this is the result of a increasing contribution from intermediate mass stars ( a and f type ) as the starburst ages .",
    "this produces artificially red 4000 break colors when , in reality , the uv flux is still quite high from young stars .",
    "this would also explain hamilton s ( 1985 ) observation that there is little evolution in the 4000 break colors of high redshift , color - selected field galaxies in terms of a lack of high mass o and b stars rather than a lack of color evolution .",
    "rakos and schombert ( 1995 ) demonstrated that butcher - oemler effect is much more dramatic than previously thought .",
    "early work on cluster galaxies found blue fractions from 30 to 40% in clusters with redshifts of 0.4 .",
    "rakos and schombert found fractions of 80% in clusters at redshifts of 0.9 .",
    "this is a very dominate effect on cluster populations not only in terms of the rapid pace of galaxy evolution as first observed by butcher and oemler , but also in the that extent of the blue galaxy population prevails over the entire cluster population at high redshifts ( 80% would imply all present - day s0 s are actively star - forming at these epochs ) .    in this paper",
    "we have derived and described the fundamental properties of the @xmath0 filter system . in particular , we have demonstrated the advantage of @xmath17 index as a detector of starbursts in galaxies .",
    "we then applied this index to establish the photometric signature of starbursts in interacting galaxies .",
    "this method was then applied to high redshift clusters to demonstrate that the butcher - oemler galaxies are due to a mixture of star - forming spirals and irregulars plus an addition component from a small fraction of starburst galaxies .",
    "\\(1 ) the @xmath0 filter system is a robust tool for exploring the stellar populations in galaxies due to the placement of the filter centers in regions of clearer evolutionary interpretation .",
    "the narrow width of the filters avoids contaminating emission lines so as to concentrate on the underlying continuum emission from stellar atmospheres or nonthermal emission .",
    "\\(2 ) the @xmath0 system is relinked to spectroscopy standards and the transformations from the original strmgren system are derived .",
    "the reddening effects are outlined and displayed in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "\\(3 ) using spectrophotometry of ellipticals , spirals , seyferts and starburst galaxies from the literature , synthetic @xmath0 indices are produced and plotted on multi - color diagrams .",
    "specific regions are occupied by various galaxy types and the @xmath17 index is demonstrated as the best indicator of starburst activity .",
    "\\(4 ) theoretical models from leitherer and heckman are used to define the behavior of the @xmath0 indices with time from the initial starburst .",
    "the inadequacy of the 4000 break color , @xmath56 , is shown due to the contribution of intermediate mass stars to an aging burst .",
    "again , the @xmath17 index is shown to be the most sensitive to starburst activity and for the longest amount of time post - starburst .",
    "\\(5 ) new photometry for a sample of arp and markarian galaxies is presented and confirms the results from the synthetic colors that starburst galaxies have a unique , detectable signature in the @xmath0 system .",
    "selection by disturbed morphology also confirms the dynamical arguments for starbursts in merging / interacting galaxies .",
    "\\(6 ) direct comparison with the photometry of blue galaxies in distant clusters ( @xmath67 ) yields the interpretation that the butcher- oemler effect is due primarily to normal star formation with a small component due to tidally induced starbursts .",
    "the recent results from hst imaging ( dressler et al .",
    "1994a , b ) confirms this interpretation and suggests that the butcher - oemler effect is a indicator of dynamical evolution as well as color evolution .    the authors wish to thank the director and staff of the lowell observatory for granting time for this project . financial support from the austrian fonds zur foerderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung is gratefully acknowledged .",
