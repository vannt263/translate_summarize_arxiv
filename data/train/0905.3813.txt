    "born as a theoretical background for thermodynamics , statistical mechanics provides nowadays a flexible approach to several scientific problems whose depth and wideness increases continuously . in the last decades in fact complex systems statistical mechanics",
    "has invaded fields as diverse as spin glasses @xcite , neural networks @xcite , protein folding @xcite , immunological memory @xcite , and also made some attempt to describe social networks @xcite , theoretical economy @xcite and urban planning @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study statistical mechanics of random diluted mean field systems , paying particular attention to its applications in social science : in a nutshell we show that the relaxed states of a particular non - glauber two - body dynamics @xcite can be  effectively",
    " described by a diluted p - spin model for a suitable non - integer real @xmath0 . after a review of the _ diffusive strategic dynamics _ previously introduced in @xcite , we implement it on an erds - renyi mean field random model and work out the corresponding mean field equilibria : each agent ( spin ) is selected through a diffusive rule , and its flipping probability is not weighed  a la glauber \" @xcite .",
    "the probabilities of its nearest neighbor flips are selected by favouring the flips which produce the maximum energy gain .",
    "we stress that this operation , although dynamically pairwise , effectively involves more than pairwise information evaluation , as the chosen agent interacts both with the first selected one as well as with its nearest neighbors , as a whole .",
    "this dynamics is shown to relax to a well defined steady state , where all the properties of stationarity are recovered @xcite .",
    "however a peculiarity happens , with respect to the standard relaxation investigated both by means of glauber dynamics @xcite , and well known both by montecarlo simulation and analytical results @xcite : the critical parameters ( temperature , or equivalently the inverse of the strength of the interactions ) are higher , of a few percent , than the expected .",
    "the whole scenario suggests a `` hidden '' many body interaction , encoded into the particular rule for selecting the spins . to investigate this feature we perform further numerical analysis , which strongly supports a more - than - two body effective interaction .",
    "then we work out analytically a theory for the randomly diluted p - spin model so to fit an effective @xmath1 , which turns out to be @xmath2 , in order to match the numerical data available by the dynamics .",
    "this result has implication both in theoretical physics , as well as in quantitative sociology , where the effective interactions always play an important role in decision making @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ uno ] our dynamics is introduced and shortly discussed ; then further numerical investigations toward a better understanding of a @xmath3 behavior are presented . in section [ tre ]",
    "the randomly diluted p - spin model is defined and exploited in all details , both analytically within the cavity field techniques as well as numerically , within a montecarlo approach .",
    "full agreement is found among the two methods . at the end",
    ", the last section is left for conclusions : the effective interaction is found and its implications analyzed . furthermore , even though the paper is written within a theoretical physics approach , remarks concerning the application to quantitative sociology are sparse through all the work . as a last remark ,",
    "for a better reading of the manuscript , we decided to put all the long proofs of the various theorems in the appendix .",
    "in this section we shortly discuss the general approach for the numerical investigation of an ising - like system @xcite , then we introduce a particular dynamics and we explain the motivation behind our choice .      in order to simulate the dynamical evolution of a system described by a curie - weiss hamiltonian @xmath4 ,",
    "living on an erds - renyi random graph @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a poisson random adjacency matrix that , on average , connects @xmath7 sites to the generic @xmath8 spin ( and thermodynamically @xmath9 , the connectivity , whenever @xmath10 ) , several different algorithms have been introduced . among them",
    "a well established one is the so - called single - flip algorithm , which makes the system evolve by means of successive spin - flips , where we call `` flip '' on the node @xmath11 the transformation @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the generic single - flip algorithm is made up of two parts : first we need a rule according to which we select a spin to be updated , then we need a probability distribution which states how likely the spin - flip is . as for the latter , following the glauber rule , given a configuration @xmath13 , the probability for the spin - flip on the @xmath11-th node reads off as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the variation in the cost function due to the flip @xmath16 hence , for single - flip dynamics the cost variation @xmath17 , consequent to a flip , only depends on the spin of a few sites , viz .",
    "the @xmath11-th one undergoing the flipping process and its @xmath18 nearest - neighbors ( for the sake of clearness , we remember that the erds - renyi , even if the amount of nearest neighbors is finite , still allows the model to be analyzed via mean - field techniques ) . as for the selection rule according to",
    "which sites are extracted , there exist several different choices , ranging from purely random to deterministic . in several contexts ( condensed - matter physics @xcite , sociology @xcite etc . ) unless no peculiar mechanisms or strategies are at work , the random updating seems to be the most plausible . in this case",
    "the probability that the current configuration @xmath13 changes into @xmath19 due to the flip @xmath20 , reads off as @xmath21 this algorithm mimics the coupling between the magnetic system with the thermal vibrations of the underlying structure , usually meant as heat - bath .",
    "the dynamics generated by @xmath22 has been intensively studied in the past ( see e.g. @xcite ) and it has been shown to lead the system to the canonical equilibrium distribution , derived form the cost function @xmath23 .",
    "however , there exist several other different mechanisms yielding single flips @xcite .",
    "for example , we can think of a system endowed with a local thermostat where diffusing excitations affect the spin dynamics .",
    "then it is reasonable to suppose that the spin - flips , and the related energy changes , have a diffusive character and that such a diffusion is biased towards those regions of the sample where energy variations are more likely to occur .",
    "also in a social context a spin - flip can occur as a result of a direct interaction ( phone call , mail exchange , etc . ) between two neighbors and if agent @xmath24 has just undergone an opinion - flip he will , in turn , prompt one out of his @xmath7 neighbors to change opinion ( opinion in social context plays the role of the spin orientation in material systems ) .",
    "these aspects are neglected by traditional dynamics and can not be described by a random updating rule . in the past a different relaxation dynamics has been introduced and it is able to take into account these aspects , namely : + _ i_. the selection rule exhibits a _ diffusive character _ : the sequence of sites selected for the updating can be thought of as the path of a random walk moving on the underlying structure . + _",
    "ii_. the diffusion is _ biased _ : the @xmath7 neighbors are not equally likely to be chosen but , amongst the @xmath7 neighbors , the most likely to be selected is also the most likely to undergo a spin - flip , namely the one which minimizes @xmath25 .    let us now formalize how the dynamics works .",
    "our mc simulations are made up of successive steps @xcite :    - being @xmath24 the newest updated spin / agent ( at the very first step @xmath24 is extracted randomly from the whole set of agents ) , we consider the corresponding set of nearest - neighbors defined as @xmath26 ; we possibly consider also the subset @xmath27 whose elements are nearest- neighbors of @xmath24 not sharing the same orientation / opinion : @xmath28 .",
    "now , for any @xmath29 we compute the cost function variation @xmath30 , which would result if the flip @xmath12 occurred ; notice that @xmath31 involves not only the nearest - neighbors of @xmath24 .",
    "- we calculate the probability of opinion - flip for all the nodes in @xmath32 , hence obtaining @xmath33 , where @xmath34 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : glauber ] ) , is the probability that the current configuration @xmath35 changes due to a flip on the @xmath11-th site .",
    "- we calculate the probability @xmath36 that among all possible @xmath7 opinion - flips considered just the @xmath11-th one is realized ; this is obtained by properly normalizing the @xmath37 : @xmath38 we can possibly restrict the choice just to the set @xmath39 , hence defining @xmath40 . notice",
    "that , as we have verified , the use of @xmath41 instead of @xmath42 does not imply any qualitative change in the results .",
    "- according to the normalized probability @xmath43 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : probability ] ) , we extract randomly the node @xmath44 and realize the opinion flip @xmath45 .",
    "- we set @xmath46 and we iterate the procedure .",
    "finally , it should be underlined that in this dynamics detailed balance is explicitly violated @xcite ; indeed , its purpose is not to recover a canonical bolzmann equilibrium but rather to model possible mechanism making the system evolve , and ultimately , to describe , at an effective level , the statics reached by a `` socially plausible '' dynamics for opinion spreading @xcite .",
    "the diffusive dynamics was shown to be able to lead the system toward a well defined steady state and to recover the expected phase transition , although the critical temperature revealed was larger than the expected one @xcite .",
    "such results were also shown to be robust with respect to the the spin magnitude @xcite and the underlying topology @xcite .",
    "critical behavior of the magnetization for the two dynamics ( diffusive and standard glauber ) as a function of @xmath47 and fixed @xmath48 .",
    "the former dynamics gives rise to a critical point higher with respect to the latter.,height=226 ]    in particular , it was evidenced that there exists a critical value of the parameter @xmath49 below which the system is spontaneously ordered .",
    "however , @xmath49 was found to be appreciably smaller than the critical value @xmath50 expected for the canonical ising model on a erdos - renyi random graph .",
    "interestingly , it is not possible describe the system subjected to the diffusive dynamics by introducing an effective hamiltonian obtained from eq ( [ isinger ] ) by a trivial rescaling .",
    "in fact , we consider the dependence on the magnetization displayed by the energies @xmath51 and @xmath52 , measured for system evolving according to the diffusive dynamics and to a traditional dynamics , respectively . as for the latter , from eq .",
    "( [ isinger ] ) it is easy to see that @xmath53 . as for @xmath51 , we found that @xmath54 for @xmath55 , while @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this is compatible with a power law behaviour @xmath59 . in order to obtain an estimate for @xmath60 we measured the ratio @xmath61 as a function of @xmath62",
    "; data are shown in the log - log scale plot of fig .",
    ", fitting procedures suggest that @xmath63 .",
    "notice that the large deviations from the linear behaviour evidenced at small value of @xmath64 are due to the fact that we are dividing two quantities close to zero .",
    "so our idea is the following : as the critical temperature raises with @xmath0 ranging from two to infinity , there can be a suitable real value of @xmath0 that matches the critical temperature found numerically , and this is compatible with the plots of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "notice that for @xmath65 , ferromagnetic transitions are no longer critical phenomena .",
    "at the critical line `` jumps '' in the magnetization and a latent heat do exist .",
    "however , if @xmath0 is though of as real , for @xmath0 slightly bigger than two , as suggested by our data , such a jump should be small ( and it goes to zero whenever @xmath66 ) , so it is difficult to check it just by looking at the magnetization as a function of @xmath67 . to investigate this property , noting that the discontinuity of the entropy ( latent heat ) can be checked by looking at the compression rate of the phase space via the shannon theorem , we show the compression rate of the strategic dynamics @xmath68 normalized by the compression rate of the glauber one @xmath69 , which offers another indication of the presence of a @xmath3 behavior . in fig .  2 , bottom panel , we plot @xmath70 as a function of the inverse temperature @xmath47 ; a minimum occurs just at the critical temperature of the system evolving according to the strategic dynamics .",

    "the probability of having a bond between any unordered p - plet of spins is @xmath94 as large , i.e.  @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "it is possible to show that our version of the hamiltonian in fact is thermodynamically equivalent with the more familiar involving the explicit adjacency tensor @xmath88 , by recall at first both the models @xmath97 where @xmath78 is a poisson variable with mean @xmath98 and @xmath99 are all independent poisson variables of mean @xmath100 .",

    "let us remember that the hamiltonian of the fully connected @xmath0-spin model ( fc ) can be written as @xcite h^fc_n ( ) = _ 1 i_1 < ... < i_p n _ i_1_i_2 ... _i_p , and let us consider the trial function @xmath131 defined as follows ( t ) = _ , which interpolates between the fully connected @xmath0-spin model and the diluted one , such that for @xmath132 only the fully connected survives , while the opposite happens for @xmath133 .",
    "let us work out the derivative with respect to @xmath106 to obtain @xmath134 by which we see that the correct scaling , in order to recover the proper infinite connectivity model , is obtained when @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 is held constant .",
    "it is worth noting that in social modeling , usually , the role of the temperature is left , or at least coupled together , to the interaction strength @xmath138 . as a consequence , in order to keep @xmath139 fixed , on different network dilution , the strength must be rescaled accordingly to @xmath140 while , if present , an external field remains unchanged as it is a one - body term , like @xmath141 , unaffected by dilution .",
    "the dilute @xmath0-spin model reduces to the fully connected one , in the infinite connectivity limit , uniformly in the size of the system .      in this section",
    "we want to look for an iterative expression of the free energy density by using a version of the cavity strategy @xcite that we briefly recall : the idea behind the cavity techniques @xcite , which , for our purposes , resembles the stochastic stability approach @xcite , is that information concerning the free energy density can be extrapolated when looking at the incremental extensive free energy given by the addition of a spin . in diluted models ,",
    "this pasted spin changes also ( infinitesimally in the high @xmath74 limit ) the connectivity and in evaluating how the free energy density varies conformingly with this , we are going to prove that it can be written in terms of a cavity function and such a connectivity shift . so the behavior of the system is encoded into these two terms .",
    "the latter is simpler as it is made only by stochastically stable terms ( a proper definition of these terms will follow through the section ) .",
    "the former , instead , must be expressed via these terms and this will be achieved by iterative expansions . at first",
    "we show how the free energy density can be decomposed via these two terms ( the cavity function and the connectivity shift ) .",
    "then , we analyze each term separately .",
    "we will see that they can be expressed by the momenta of the magnetization and of the multi - overlaps , weighted in a perturbed boltzmann state , which recovers the standard one in the thermodynamic limit .",
