    "so far only second order round beams have been considered as possible mismatch modes : the influence of anisotropic on second and higher order mismatch modes is expected to be an important factor in halo formation .",

    "this papers  @xcite deals with the coupled motion between the two tranverse coordinates of a particles beam arising from the space - charge forces , and , in particular , with the effects of the beam coupling which have ratio @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the envelope semi - axes - rms .",

    "however , it is only when the ratio @xmath6 and the large beam size - rms mismatched on the order of 100%  @xcite that the coupling can produce an observable effect in the beam as a whole .",
    "this effect arises from both , a beating in amplitude between the two coordinate directions for the single - particle motion , and from the coupling between oscillations modes beam , resulting in growth and transfer of emittance from one phase plane to another , in the beam develops an elliptical shape and therefore in the transition from isotropic to anisotropic beam profiles .",
    "nonlinear space - charge forces can also lead to equipartitioning of energy between degrees of freedom .",

    "the beam can be predicted to equipatition , or reach a state where velocity spreads in two directions are equal . in space - charge dominated beams , coulomb collisions are infrequent to account for the energy transfer , whereas space charge waves have been shown to be a possible coupling canditate  @xcite .",

    "resonant phase mixing is a reversible process in which it is governed by vlasov s equation .",
    "however , an essential question for the accelerator designer is wheter this process in operationally reversible . while it may be possible in principle to compensate operationally against phase space dilution , this compensation must be completed before any mixing has smeared a significant number of particles through global regions of phase space .",

    "the equipartition of beam is driven for anisotropics processes .",
    "it is , therefore , to develop an improved understanding of fundamental collective stability properties , including the case where a large temperature anisotropy can drive electrostatic harrys - type  @xcite and/or eletromagnetic weibel - type   @xcite instabilities , familiar in the study of electrically neutral plasmas  @xcite . in plasmas with strongly anisotropic distribution functions",

    "the term equipartition broadly refers to the ergodic property of multi - dimensional hamiltonian systems , which tend to distribute uniformly over the phase space surface of constant energy .",
    "the conservation of energy plays the fundamental role in classical equilibrium thermodynamics .",

    "the best known example of a turbulent equipartition is the quasilinear plateau of the distribution function caused by the nonlinear landau damping of plasmas waves . in a toroidal turbulent plasma ,",
    "the relevant invariants are given by the frozen - in law ( in the fluid limit ) or the adiabatic invariant and the liouville theorem ( in the collisionless limit ) , both limits derivable from the more general poincare invariant .",
    "the plasma mixing by low - frequency electrostatic modes in a tokamak , subject to these conservative laws , results in the inhomogeneous density and temperature profiles peaked at the center even in the absence of particles and energy fluxes , thus presenting the underlying mechanism of the pinch effect and the profiles consistency in tokamak  @xcite .",

    "the general property of space - charge dominated beam behaviour is that a beam with an initial nonlinear profile tends to be more uniform and this process is associated with strong emittance growth and the appearance of beam halo .",
