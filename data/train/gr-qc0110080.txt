    "the theoretical existence of space - time wormholes has intrigued experts and public alike .",
    "wheeler @xcite speculated that quantum fluctuations in space - time topology can occur , so that the smooth space - time of classical einstein gravity becomes , at the planck scale , a continual foam of short - lived interconnections .",
    "if such a wormhole could be expanded to macroscopic size , it could provide a short cut between otherwise distant regions , like a bookworm tunnelling between different pages of an atlas .",
    "certainly all the standard stationary black - hole solutions have wormhole ( @xmath0 ) spatial topology , describing two alice - through - the - looking - glass universes joined by the famous einstein - rosen bridge @xcite , or wormhole throat . in such cases ,",
    "the two universes are not causally connected , so that it is impossible to travel between them , any attempt leading instead into the black hole @xcite . however , this is only just so ; a light ray can be sent along the past boundary of one universe to the future boundary of the other , just escaping the black hole .",
    "thus it is not difficult to imagine a small modification which would yield a traversible wormhole .",
    "morris & thorne @xcite popularized traversible wormholes as a respectable theoretical possibility , studying static , spherically symmetric cases in detail .",
    "the spatial topology is the same as in the black - hole cases , but the throat or minimal surface is preserved in time , so that observers can pass through it in either direction , travelling freely between the two universes .",
    "according to the einstein equation , such a geometry requires matter which does not satisfy a classical positive - energy property , the weak energy condition .",
    "however , this condition can be violated quantum - mechanically , e.g.  in the casimir effect , or in alternative gravity theories .",
    "such negative - energy matter was dubbed exotic matter by morris & thorne .",
    "this provoked renewed interest in traversible wormholes , as reviewed by visser @xcite .",
    "the possible astrophysical existence of wormholes has been taken seriously enough for searches of observational data @xcite .",
    "the morris - thorne framework begs development in at least two important respects , quite apart from generalizing beyond static , spherically symmetric cases .",
    "firstly , the exotic matter was not modelled , but simply assumed to exist in exactly the configuration needed to support the wormhole . secondly",
    ", the back - reaction of the transported matter on the wormhole was ignored .",
    "if the wormhole turns out to be unstable to such back - reaction , it would be useless for actual transport .",
    "many physicists instinctive reaction is that negative energy , unbounded below , will lead to instability .",
    "another practical question is : if the negative - energy source fails , i.e.  the exotic matter is not maintained , what happens to the wormhole ?",
    "again , a pessimistic reaction is that the negative energy densities are likely to create naked singularities .",
    "an alternative prediction was that the wormhole would collapse to a black hole @xcite .",
    "the same reference introduced a framework for studying dynamic wormholes , in which both wormholes and black holes are locally defined by the same geometrical objects , trapping horizons , with one key difference : black holes have achronal horizons and wormholes have temporal horizons , so that they are respectively one - way and two - way traversible .",
    "this also indicated that a wormhole could be constructed from a black hole using exotic matter .    to find definite answers to the above questions , it is necessary to specify the exotic matter model .",
    "various studies have been based on alternative gravity theories or semi - classical quantum field theory , e.g.  @xcite",
    ". however , the difficulty of solving the field equations tends to obscure issues of principle .",
    "here we propose a toy model , intended to describe the essential dynamics of a wormhole , but explicitly integrable , so that concrete answers to the above questions are easily found . a similar approach in the context of black - hole evaporation involved the cghs two - dimensional dilaton gravity model @xcite , which was expected to share similar features with spherically symmetric black - hole evaporation by hawking radiation .",
    "certainly classical black - hole dynamics is qualitatively similar , for instance in regard to cosmic censorship , but such properties are much easier to prove in the toy model @xcite than in the corresponding realistic model , the spherically symmetric einstein - klein - gordon system @xcite .",
    "here we propose a simple generalization of the cghs model to include a ghost klein - gordon field , i.e.  with the gravitational coupling taking the opposite sign to normal .",
    "this is a specific model for the exotic matter , or more accurately exotic radiation , as we take the massless field for simplicity .",
    "the article is organised as follows .",
    " ii describes the model and how its general solution can be constructed from initial data .",
    " iii reviews the static black - hole solution and introduces the static wormhole solution , each of which depend on one parameter , mass or horizon radius .",
    " iv describes what happens to an initially static wormhole when the ghost field supporting it is turned off and allowed to disperse .",
    " v shows how to construct a static wormhole by irradiating an initially static black hole with the ghost field .",
    " vi describes the operation of a wormhole for transport or signalling , using a normal klein - gordon field to model the matter or radiation , including the back - reaction of the field on the wormhole .",
    " vii shows how to maintain the operating wormhole in a static state , or return it to its original state .  viii concludes .",

    "note that the original reference @xcite defined mass as @xmath38 , in which case @xmath39 would be analogous to radius , but for @xmath40 this makes no essential difference in the following .",
    "next , we consider the case that @xmath41 but @xmath42 , finding the solution @xmath43 where the origin has again been fixed .",

    "the model naturally contains both static black holes and static traversible wormholes . before proceeding",
    ", we note an important feature of both cases , the trapping horizons , defined by @xmath56 , or equivalently @xmath57 or @xmath58 @xcite . in the black hole",

    "this illustrates how trapping horizons of different type may be used to locally define both black holes and wormholes @xcite . locating the trapping horizons , or equivalently the trapped regions where @xmath63 , is a key feature of the following analysis of dynamic situations .",
    "one can now study what happens to a static wormhole if its negative - energy source fails .",

    ", the geometry may be characterized as a non - static wormhole , as observers may still traverse it for a certain time , after which the attempt leads only into the black hole .",
    "we next study how to convert a black hole into a traversible wormhole by irradiating it with the ghost field .",
    "this is not simply the time reverse of the wormhole collapses described above , which would represent the creation of a wormhole from a white hole , as one can see by inverting the conformal diagrams ( fig .",

    "instead , one needs to begin the irradiation at some positive value @xmath86 of the kruskal - like coordinates @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ staticbhwh](a ) ) .",
    "moreover , in order to close up a future trapped region by merging its trapping horizons , the negative energy densities required must be larger than those required to maintain the static wormhole which finally forms @xcite . in other words , @xmath87 must first reach a maximum greater than @xmath88 . the simplest way to achieve",

    "[ cons](b ) ) .",
    "the trapped region composing the black hole simply evaporates .",
    "this classically unexpected behaviour is , of course , due to the negative energy densities . as in the wormhole collapse case ,",
    "the trapping horizons can be smoothed off by taking smoother profiles for @xmath101 , but the details are not particularly illuminating . in summary ,",
    "static wormholes have been constructed by irradiating a black hole with ghost radiation .    .",
    "( b ) conformal diagram : the initially static black hole , as in ( fig .",
    "[ staticbhwh](a ) ) , becomes a dynamic wormhole , eventually reaching a static state as in ( fig .",
    "[ staticbhwh](b ) ) .",
    "the black hole has been converted into a traversible wormhole.,width=264,height=377 ]    one can also regard this as analogous to black - hole evaporation , with the ghost radiation modelling the ingoing negative - energy hawking radiation , suggesting that the final state of black hole evaporation might be a stationary wormhole @xcite .",
    "this would naturally resolve the information - loss puzzle , as there is no singularity in which information is lost ; everything that fell into the black hole eventually re - emerges .",
    "if a wormhole is actually used to transport a parcel or person between the two universes , the transported matter will affect the wormhole by changing the gravitational field . in principle",
    "this occurs even if the wormhole is merely used for signalling .",
    "we will study the dynamical effects of such back - reaction by using the field @xmath8 to model the matter or radiation .",
    "the use of klein - gordon radiation rather than more realistic matter is for simplicity only ; any source of mass - energy would have more or less similar gravitational effects . in the current model ,",
    "the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) show explicitly that increasing @xmath102 has an equivalent gravitational effect to reducing @xmath103 , which we have already shown can cause collapse to a black hole .",
    "thus it is to be expected that too much transport would destroy the wormhole .",
    "a worse possibility is that the wormhole might be unstable to the slightest perturbation and start to collapse immediately .",
    "we investigate this below , giving the first concrete examples of wormhole operation including back - reaction .        again taking the simplest case",
    ", we consider a step pulse of positive - energy radiation ( fig .",
    "[ opr1](a ) ) : @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "the energy of the pulse may be defined as the change in the gravitational energy ( [ energy ] ) due to the pulse , which evaluates at @xmath60 as @xmath106 in the following , we assume that the energy of the pulse should not be too large , corresponding to the anticipated limit on how much mass - energy can be sent through the wormhole without causing it to collapse into a black hole",
    ". specifically we find @xmath107 to avoid an @xmath53 singularity in the middle region .",
    "thus the pulse energy should be less than the effective mass of the wormhole . inserting the conversion factor @xmath108 from length to mass",
    ", a one - metre wormhole could transport over a hundred earth masses .",
    "this is hardly a practical limitation , once we establish stability .    the constraints ( [ constraints ] )",
    "@xmath109 integrate to    @xmath110    and the solution is @xmath111    the locations of the trapping horizons @xmath57 and @xmath58 are given respectively by @xmath112 thus the double trapping horizon of the initially static wormhole bifurcates when the radiation arrives ( fig .",
    "[ opr1](b ) ) .",
    "after the pulse has passed , the two trapping horizons run parallel in the @xmath19 coordinates , forming a non - static traversible wormhole .",
    "if the pulse energy is small , @xmath113 , the wormhole persists in an almost static state for a long time , @xmath114 . nevertheless , even for an arbitrarily weak pulse , eventually a spatial @xmath53 singularity develops , similar to that of the static black hole .",
    "observers close enough to the singularity can no longer traverse the wormhole , so it constitutes a black hole with two event horizons .",
    "thus the static wormhole exhibits a type of neutral stability , neither strictly stable in that it does not return to its initial state , nor strictly unstable in that there is no sudden runaway .",
    "note that black holes are also neutrally stable in this sense ; perturbing a black hole by dropping positive - energy matter into it increases the area of the trapping horizon finitely , by the first and second laws of black - hole dynamics @xcite .",
    "keeping an operating wormhole viable indefinitely , defying its natural fate as a black hole , requires additional negative energy to balance the transported matter .",
    "the simplest way to maintain the wormhole is just to set initial data @xmath115 so that the source terms in the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) cancel to the static wormhole values .",
    "thus the wormhole remains static .",
    "the additional negative - energy radiation has balanced the positive - energy radiation , leaving the gravitational field unchanged .",
    "alternatively , the wormhole may be maintained by beaming in additional negative - energy radiation before or after the positive - energy pulse .",
    "we take the same step pulse in @xmath116 ( [ step ] ) and precede it with a compensating pulse in the ghost field ( fig .  [",
    "opr2](a ) ) : @xmath117 again we require small pulse energy , @xmath107 , to avoid a singularity . the constraints ( [ constraints ] )",
    "become @xmath118 which integrate to    @xmath119    and the solution follows as @xmath120    the locations of the trapping horizons are @xmath121 which again are straight line segments .",
    "the double horizon bifurcates when the ghost pulse arrives , temporarily opening up a trapped region , but the two horizons subsequently merge to form a static wormhole again ( fig .",
    "[ opr2](b ) ) .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the energy of the ghost pulse , @xmath122 , balances that of the other pulse : @xmath123 in fact , the final state is identical to the initial state in this symmetric case .",
    "the wormhole can also be returned to a different static state , with different throat radius , by less symmetric double pulses .",
    "the examples show that there is no practical problem of fine - tuning the ghost field to keep the wormhole static .",
    "an almost static wormhole is still traversible and can be adjusted at any time to bring it closer to staticity , or to change its size .",
    "this is essentially due to the neutral stability .",
    "space - time wormholes remain in the realms of science fiction and theoretical physics . by the standards of either genre , they are not so far - fetched , differing from experimentally established physics by only one step , the existence of negative energy densities in sufficient concentrations . here we have not addressed this issue but , assuming a positive answer , have investigated the behaviour of the resulting wormholes , evolving dynamically according to field equations . in particular , we have found detailed answers to the following practical questions .",
    "( i ) how can one construct a traversible wormhole ? by bathing a black hole in exotic radiation .",
    "( ii ) is an operating wormhole stable under the back - reaction of the transported matter ? in this case , neutrally stable .",
    "( iii ) how can a wormhole be maintained indefinitely for transport or signalling ?",
    "by balance of positive and negative energy .",
    "( iv ) what happens if the negative - energy source fails ?",
    "the wormhole collapses into a black hole .",
    "this was mostly predicted by a general theory of wormhole dynamics @xcite , but here we have given concrete examples , by virtue of the exact solubility of the field equations of two - dimensional dilaton gravity . despite the supposedly unphysical nature of a ghost klein - gordon field , fears about instability , runaway processes and naked singularities proved to be unfounded .",
    "more realistic situations may differ in some respects , such as wormhole stability , which may be affected by backscattering and will presumably depend on the exotic matter model .",
    "however , the same principles and methods should apply , such as energy balance and tracking of trapping horizons . indeed ,",
    "apart from the inclusion of exotic matter or radiation , the methods are the same as those used to analyze black - hole dynamics @xcite .",
    "in particular , the explicit examples of dynamic interconversion of black holes and wormholes should assuage objections that they are fundamentally different objects .",
    "rather , wormholes and black holes have similar physics and a unified theory .",
